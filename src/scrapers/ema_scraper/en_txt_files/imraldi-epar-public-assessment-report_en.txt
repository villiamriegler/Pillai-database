2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
This centralized marketing authorization application concerns genetically engineered recombinant human 
monoclonal antibody product Imraldi 40 mg, solution for injection in pre-filled syringe, Article 3 (1) of 
Regulation EC No 726/2004, annex (1). The Sponsor has introduced the name Imraldi for the biosimilar 
in their D121 responses, but in the current assessment report the name Imraldi is mostly used for the 
biosimilar. 
Imraldi is a biosimilar adalimumab with the EU Humira as the reference medicinal product. Imraldi is a 
genetically engineered recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Imraldi is 
currently available as a 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) presentation.  
Adalimumab (Humira) was first approved in 2002 by the FDA and in 2003 by the European Commission 
(EC). Adalimumab is a well characterized drug substance by its pharmacological, efficacy and safety 
profile qualities.  
Imraldi has been developed as a similar medicinal product according to Article 10(4) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product used throughout the development program is Humira, 
sourced from the European Union. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The marketing authorisation is applied in the following adult indications approved for EU Humira: 
• 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  
Imraldi in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for: 
• 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when 
the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including 
methotrexate has been inadequate. 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not 
previously treated with MTX. 
Imraldi can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued 
treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Imraldi has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray 
and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
• 
Axial spondyloarthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Axial Spondyloarthritis without 
Radiographic Evidence of AS 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have 
had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or 
MRI, who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 11/111 
 
 
 
 
• 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when 
the response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. 
Imraldi has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured 
by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease and to improve 
physical function. 
• 
Psoriasis (PsO) 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult 
patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
• 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adult patients with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. 
• 
Uveitis 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in 
adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of 
corticosteroid- sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. 
• 
Crohn’s disease (CD) 
Imraldi is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult 
patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a 
corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies. 
• 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) 
Imraldi is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids 
and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies. 
As Imraldi is currently only available as a single dose 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) presentation, the 
Applicant intended initially to claim the paediatric indications only for those patients who are according to 
the body weight eligible to be administered the full 40 mg dose. However, similarly to other recent 
adalimumab biosimilar applications, the CHMP has recommended that these paediatric indications should 
be aligned with those of the EU Humira. Therefore the Applicant is now applying for all the same paediatric 
indications as approved for Humira: 
• 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis polyarticular (JIA): 
Imraldi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate 
response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Imraldi can be given 
as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. Imraldi has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years.” 
•

2.1.2.  Biologic features 
About the product 
Imraldi is a genetically engineered recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
produced in CHO cell lines. Its active substance is adalimumab, which neutralises the biological function 
of both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell 
surface TNF receptors and modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including 
changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration.  
TNF-α has been shown to be elevated in several disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of AS, Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and hidradenitis suppurativa 
(HS). 
Imraldi belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group “Immunosuppressants, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha 
(TNF-α) inhibitors” (ATC code: L04AB04 ). Imraldi is presented in single dose pre-filled syringe containing 
40 mg of adalimumab.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of Imraldi (referred to as active substance (DS) in the text) is adalimumab, a 
chimeric human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cell line. Imraldi has been developed by Samsung Bioepis as a similar biological medicinal product 
to the reference medicinal product, Humira (EMEA/H/C/481), which received a marketing authorisation in 
the EU via the centralised procedure on 08 Sep 2003. Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-α and 
neutralises the biological function of TNF-α by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface 
TNF-α receptors. Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by 
TNF-α, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration 
(ELAM-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1). 
Imraldi active substance is formulated with sodium citrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine buffer, 
sorbitol, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. Imraldi is presented in a single-use pre-filled syringe 
(PFS) containing 40 mg adalimumab to be administered via subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The proposed 
adult dosing and the recommended posology of Imraldi correspond with Humira containing 40 mg 
adalimumab; also the pediatric dosing follows that of EU-Humira, although it is not possible to administer 
Imraldi to paediatric patients that require less than a full 40 mg dose due to the absence of a vial 
presentation. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Structure 
Imraldi (adalimumab) is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody, which is typically a "Y"- shaped 
large glycoprotein consisting of two kappa light chains each with a molecular weight of approximately 24 
kDa and two IgG1 heavy chains each with a molecular weight of approximately 49 kDa. The total 
molecular weight of adalimumab is approximately 148 kDa. Each light chain consists of 214 amino acid 
residues and each heavy chain consists of 451 amino acid residues. Its molecular formula without the 
N-glycan moiety is C6448H9996N1732O2020S42. One N-linked glycosylation site is located at Asn301 on 
each heavy chain and there are no O-linked glycosylation sites. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing facility at Biogen Inc. (North Carolina, USA) is the intended site for commercial 
production.  
Imraldi active substance is manufactured, packaged, stability tested, and quality-control tested in 
accordance with EU good manufacturing practices. 
The manufacturing process begins with thawing of a vial of the working cell bank (WCB), which is a 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line transfected with Imraldi expression vector. After thawing of the 
WCB vial, the culture is serially expanded in cell mass and volume for inoculation into the production 
bioreactor. The cell culture fluid is subsequently purified with a series of steps including chromatography, 
viral inactivation and viral filtration.

Materials used in the manufacture of the active substance have been listed together with information on 
the quality and control of these materials.  
Cell banking system 
The applicant is using a two-tiered cell bank system in overall accordance with ICH Q5A, Q5B, and Q5D 
guidelines. The host cell line is a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line. Its safety is well established and it has 
been used as the host cell line in the production of numerous commercialised recombinant therapeutic 
antibodies. The generation of the expression is sufficiently detailed.  
The genetic stability of the Imraldi cell substrate was confirmed by genetic and phenotypic analysis 
methods, as required by ICH Q5B and Q5D guidelines. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For the control of the Imraldi active substance manufacturing process, the process controls are divided 
into controlled parameters (process inputs) and performance parameters (process outputs). For the input 
parameters, critical-, key- and non-key control parameters have been defined for each step in the process 
as well as the outputs, critical and process consistency in-process controls and in-process tests. The 
criticality is associated with impact on the defined critical quality attribute of the SB5 active substance.  
Controlled parameters are input variables or conditions of the manufacturing process used to control the 
manufacturing process.

Full details of the process controls have been provided in the dossier. 
Process validation 
The commercial manufacturing process for Imraldi DS has been validated at Biogen large-scale 
manufacturing facility in USA. The validation of the cell culture process covered all steps from WCB thaw 
and cell expansion. With respect to the purification process, studies were conducted to confirm that each 
unit operation is able to show consistency of achieving product yield and reducing impurity content to an 
acceptable level. Overall, all controlled parameters were within the action limits and validation acceptance 
criteria were met. 
A product risk assessment has been performed to determine the criticality of individual product attribute 
impacts on the overall quality of SB5 DS and to support the overall testing strategy. Justification for 
classification of the evaluated product attributes was appropriately provided. The rationale and 
methodology for the process risk assessments have been clearly presented and are considered 
acceptable. 
Scale-down systems were used to model the full-scale Imraldi manufacturing cell culture and purification 
processes. The descriptions of the scale-down models have been provided in sufficient detail. The 
scale-down models have been qualified, based on comparisons with manufacturing scale data. 
Clearance of process-related impurities was validated by using direct measurements as well as by using 
scale-down models The presented data demonstrate that the Imraldi active substance  process for 
commercial production clears process-related impurities to acceptable levels considered safe for 
biopharmaceutical products.  
A summary of test results for the process intermediate stability hold time studies were provided. The 
results of the hold time studies support the claimed maximum hold times. 
Manufacturing process development 
The modifications introduced to the manufacturing processes during the development have been 
adequately described and sufficient details and rationale for each step has been provided. The 
manufacturing process and control strategy were established during development. The risk assessment 
results were used to classify the process parameters and define the process control strategy.  
Comparability assessments were performed to ensure that the batches used at each stage of Imraldi 
development are representative of subsequent development stages, and that changes in the 
manufacturing process at each stage of development do not affect product quality.  
Characterisation 
The characterisation of Imraldi involved determination of the structures (primary, secondary, and 
higher-order), glycosylation, charge variants, purity/impurities, cellular potency and binding activity. The 
results and conclusions of these studies are discussed in CTD section 3.2.R, Biosimilarity, as the 
characterisation studies are also part of the biosimilarity assessment.  
Specification 
Specifications were set for quantity, identity, biological activity, purity and impurities, and safety taking 
the principles of the ICH Q6B guideline into account. Other general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality) are 
also included in the specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 16/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the test parameters proposed to be included in the Imraldi DS specification are considered 
appropriate and in line with relevant guidance.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used for DS and DP release testing have been described in detail and validated 
according to ICH Q2. Validation summaries as well as detailed validation reports have been in submitted 
for those methods which are not conducted according to the Ph. Eur. In addition, the suitability of the 
compendial method addressing safety aspects (endotoxin and microbial enumeration) has been verified. 
The provided validation results indicate that the analytical methods for active substance release control 
are suitable for their intended use.  
Batch analysis 
The Applicant has provided batch analyses data. Almost all batches complied with the specifications set at 
the time of testing and thus support the conclusion of the Applicant that the active substance 
manufacturing process can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce active substance material 
meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes.  
Reference materials 
Reference standards are established to demonstrate consistency in the manufacturing process of each 
development stage through extensive set of analytical tests including biological and physicochemical 
assays. Also, reference standards are used for method development and validation, as well as 
assessment of continuity of reference standards themselves. In particular, reference standards are used 
to evaluate the system suitability of analytical methods. 
Stability 
The Applicant has provided currently available real-time stability data at long-term, at intermediate, and 
at accelerated conditions. Supportive stability data was also provided. No critical changes or significant 
trends were observed in the tested parameters.  
A shelf life of Imraldi DS is based on the long-term stability data. No clear trends can be observed in the 
provided data and all shelf-life acceptance criteria were met. Considering that the long-term storage 
condition can be agreed. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The manufacture of SB5 bulk pre-filled syringes takes place at the finished product manufacturing facility. 
The manufacturing process of Imraldi finished product (referred to as finished product (DP) in the text) 
involves aseptic filling of pre-filled syringes, and no additional dilution steps are applied, thus the Imraldi 
finished product has the same composition as the Imraldi active substance.  
Description and composition of the finished product 
Imraldi finished product is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale brown, sterile and preservative-free 
solution for injection. Imraldi finished product is presented as a single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) which 
nominally contains 0.8 mL of solution and 40 mg of adalimumab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 17/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The SB5 finished product has the same composition as the active substance (adalimumab, sodium citrate 
dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, and 
polysorbate 20) There are no novel excipients and no preservatives in the formulation. 
Formulation development 
In the developmental stage, formulation development studies were performed to confirm the effects of 
pH, buffer, excipient, and protein concentration on the stability of Imraldi finished product. The 
formulation development studies and the results were presented. From the results of the developmental 
studies above, the following conclusions were drawn for optimised Imraldi formulation. Finished product 
formulation robustness study was done to assess the formulation robustness of Imraldi finished product 
with variation of protein concentration, pH, L-histidine concentration and sorbitol concentration. 
Additionally, optimal formulation composition range was identified through this study. Results of the 
developmental robustness study showed that the Imraldi finished product formulation is robust within 
range of protein concentration, pH, and L-histidine concentration. The overall results of the formulation 
robustness study indicate that the formulation may be sufficiently robust at the proposed storage 
conditions, and that the protein concentration and pH are important factors to ensure acceptable quality 
of the finished product throughout the shelf-life. 
The Imraldi DP manufacturing process consists of DS thaw, pooling and mixing of the DS, sterile filtration, 
and aseptic syringe filling/stoppering. The manufacturing process of Imraldi finished product has been 
developed through process characterisation and an engineering run before process validation. The final 
process was verified by process validation.  
For Imraldi finished product process characterisation, a risk assessment was conducted to select 
parameters that affect product quality and process consistency based on the development data and 
clinical GMP batch experience. As a result of the risk assessment, performed with Imraldi finished 
product, different manufacturing parameters were selected for further study during process 
characterisation.  
Container closure integrity has been studied during development of Imraldi finished product and this test 
is included in the on-going stability studies.  
Development studies on the finished product package for usability have been performed. A simulated-use 
human factors study was performed to confirm that the hazards associated with use of the product have 
been controlled.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The straightforward DP manufacturing process starts with active substance receipt and storage, involves 
thawing, pooling, and mixing of the active substance, followed by sterile filtration, aseptic syringe filling, 
and plunger placement. The DS has the same formulation as the DP, thus no dilution/formulation steps 
are applied. The controlled parameters and in-process tests and controls have been provided for all 
relevant manufacturing steps with associated In-process specifications and/or action limits, where 
applicable. The description of the Imraldi DP manufacturing process and the proposed control strategy for 
the manufacturing process are considered appropriate.  
Process validation 
The Imraldi DP manufacturing process was validated at the proposed commercial manufacturing site 
through input parameters (controlled process parameters) and output parameters (performance 
parameters) with predetermined acceptance criteria. Overall, all PVR batches met satisfactorily the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 18/111 
 
 
 
 
pre-determined acceptance criteria for all controlled process parameters, in-process tests and release 
tests.  
Product specification 
Specifications were set for quantity, identity, biological activity, purity and impurities, and safety taking 
the principles of the ICH Q6B guideline into account. Other general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality) are 
also included in the specification. 
The tests for quantity, identity, general tests, and the safety tests are considered appropriate and their 
acceptance limits are acceptable.  
Container closure system 
The syringe is a 1 mL syringe with needle and needle shield. This packaging is standard for pre-filled 
syringe presentations. The glass complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1, the silicone oil lubricant with Ph. Eur. 3.1.8 
and the rubber part of the needle shield with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. Appropriate drawings were provided.  
Stability of the product 
The Applicant has provided data on stability studies performed at the long-term storage condition (5 ± 
3°C), at the accelerated storage condition, and at the stress storage condition. All evaluated long-term 
stability parameters met the acceptance criteria supporting the Applicant’s shelf-life claim. At accelerated 
condition, although slight changes in the purity of Imraldi DP were observed, all the results met the 
acceptance criteria. At stress condition, significant changes in the purity of Imraldi DP were observed for 
all studied batches. Based on the provided stability data the proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored 
at 5 ± 3°C can be agreed. Temperature cycling studies have been performed where the finished product 
was exposed to several cycles of low and elevated temperatures. The results show that Imraldi finished 
product tolerates the applied excursions in temperature without significant degradation or other negative 
impact on quality attributes. The finished product sensitivity to light has been studied with the naked 
pre-filled syringes and with the commercial pack in ICH Q1B Option 2 conditions. The results show that 
Imraldi finished product solution is light sensitive and degradation is significant in the naked syringe. 
In addition, the Applicant has performed a Patient convenience stability study to monitor the stability 
profile during exposure at ambient temperature (room temperature) conditions in use using Imraldi DP 
aged to 36 months. The Imraldi DP batches were subjected to accelerated condition up to 4 weeks. The 
observed changes were within the expected ranges based on the results from stability studies performed 
at accelerated condition, and met the acceptance criteria. The currently provided long-term stability data 
support the shelf-life of 36 months at the long-term storage condition (5 ± 3°C). Thus, the additional 
stability claim in SPC section 6.4 of “may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25°C for a period 
of up to 14 days” is considered to be supported by the provided data.  
Adventitious agents 
The manufacturing process of the DS or the DP does not contain any material of human or animal origin 
and therefore the risk of adventitious agents entering the DP is considered low. The risk of microbial and 
mycoplasma contamination is adequately addressed, cell banks are demonstrated to be sterile, and 
sufficiently low bioburden is established for DS bulk.

The virus validation studies have been performed in accordance with the Note for guidance on virus 
validation studies (CPMP/BWP/268/95) and the choice of model viruses is considered appropriate. The 
manufacturing purification process includes virus inactivation steps as well as removal steps.  
Overall the inactivation/removal of different types of viruses is considered to be sufficient.  
Biosimilarity 
Introduction 
The biosimilarity between Imraldi and Humira, authorised in the European Union (EU), has been assessed 
through a comprehensive physicochemical and biological comparability exercise. The study follows the 
general principles as outlined in the guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance; Quality issues (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012).  
Physicochemical and biological characterisation studies to support biosimilarity 
Similarity range 
Similarity ranges for the side-by-side analyses have been established based on characterisation results. 
The available data is sufficient for evaluating the batch-to-batch variability present in EU Humira. It is 
noted that not all the quality attributes that are measured on a metric scale were assessed. For the 
side-by-side comparison of the additional biological properties of EU Humira included in the side-by-side 
comparison has been calculated, whereas the attributes characterizing the higher-order structure are 
required to be “similar to that of reference product within instrumental variability”. For certain quality 
attributes the statistical approach has resulted in wide similarity ranges, however, as characterisation 
results for the EU Humira batches are provided, an assessment independent of the chosen statistical 
approach is possible.  
Similarity exercise summary 
Comprehensive characterisation studies were performed using state-of-the-art analytical procedures to 
demonstrate similarity between Imraldi and Humira. As discussed below, the results of Imraldi were 
mostly within the similarity ranges defined based on characterisation results from EU Humira batches. 
Primary structure 
The primary structure of Imraldi and EU Humira was compared with regard to the molecular weight, 
amino acid sequence, N- and C-terminal sequence, peptide map, disulphide bridges, free sulphydryl 
groups, methionine oxidation and asparagine deamidation. The differences observed in molecular weight 
analyses due to slight differences in the glycosylation profile, as well as the differences in C-terminal 
lysine content, and the amount of free thiol group have been properly discussed and justified. In addition, 
for methionine oxidation a small difference is observed between Imraldi and Humira. This difference is 
considered to be of no clinical relevance.  
Glycan profile 
The glycosylation profiles of Imraldi and Humira were compared with regard to N-glycosylation site, 
glycan structures, as well as for relative quantities of %Afucose, %HM (high mannose), %G0F, %G1F, 
and %G2F. N-glycosylation site of Imraldi is identifided as identical to that of Humira. %G0F, %Afucose, 
%sialylation were found to be slightly different in Imraldi compared to Humira. The differences had been 
appropriately discussed and the differences can be considered clinically insignificant..

Purity and impurity profiles 
In the comparisons of the purity and impurity profiles, similar low levels of HMW aggregates were 
measured both for Imraldi and for Humira. These results were confirmed by orthogonal analyses. Also 
another method shows similarity, although the %IgG is marginally lower for Imraldi compared to Humira.  
A difference in non-glycosylated heavy chain (NGHC) levels was detected. The Applicant has provided 
experimental data demonstrating that the NGHC levels detected in Imraldi will not impact on biological 
activity. 
Charge variants  
The charged variant profiles of Imraldi and Humira differ to some degree. The percentage of acidic 
variants in Imraldi DP batches used in the side-by-side analysis is different fromHumira, although all 
batches are within the similarity ranges. The increase in acidic variants is accompanied by significantly 
lower levels of basic variants in Imraldi. These results have been confirmed by another analytical method.  
In order to assess the impact of the differences, the Applicant has identified the variants present in the 
fractions, determined the glycan profiles, and studied biological activity. Based on the results from 
identity and biological activity studies conducted, it can be concluded that the remaining minor difference 
in acidic variants is of no clinical concern.  
Higher order structures  
The secondary structure was elucidated; the tertiary structure; the size distribution; the subvisible 
particles. The three-dimensional conformation was further analysed by antibody conformational array. No 
significant differences could be seen between Imraldi and Humira, therefore similarity with regard to 
higher order structures can be concluded.  
Protein content 
The  protein  contents  were  determined  in  terms  of  concentration  by  using  an  ultraviolet/visible 
spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. The results showed that the protein concentration of Imraldi 
and EU Humira were similar. 
Fab-related biological properties 
As Fab-related properties, TNF-α binding, TNF-α neutralisation, and apoptosis activity were evaluated in 
the assessment. The results of all Imraldi batches included in the three assays are within both the 
historical min-max range of Humira, as well as within the established similarity ranges. Comparison of the 
relative binding of Imraldi and Humira to TNF-α has been measured, and the values derived thereof are 
given in % of relative binding activity. Additional studies confirmed similar TNF-α binding affinity between 
Imraldi and EU Humira. 
Fc-related biological properties 
As Fc-related functions, the Applicant has studied FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, FcRn, C1q binding, 
as well as ADCC and CDC activities. The binding activities of the Imraldi batches towards the Fc-receptors 
are all within the similarity ranges. For FcγRIIa binding, similarity was confirmed using a second 
orthogonal analytical method.  
In the ADCC assay using the high affinity CD16 receptor, the activity of Imraldi DP batches relative to the 
reference standard, all tested batches being within the established similarity range. The ADCC activity of 
Humira ranged from. In the CDC assay, the relative activities of the Imraldi and Humira batches used in 
the side-by-side analysis do not overlap. However, based on the reported results, as well as the 
established similarity range, the claim for similarity with regard to CDC activity is supported.

Additional biological properties 
As additional biological testing, the following properties have been compared; inhibition of cytokine 
release assay (in vitro IBD model), inhibition of apoptosis assay (in vitro IBD model), regulatory 
macrophage function assay, inhibition of adhesion molecule expression, transmembrane TNF-α binding 
assay, FcγRIIIa (158F/F) binding, FcγRIIIb binding, LTα3 binding assay, and conformational antibody 
array.  
The additional biological testing, together with the Fab-related and Fc-related assays, address relevant 
mode of actions for adalimumab. The results support the similarity claim. 
Comparative stability studies 
To compare degradation profiles of Imraldi and Humira, the Applicant has conducted comparative stability 
studies under heat stressed and accelerated conditions, as well as oxidation and photostability studies. 
Overall, the changes that occurred under stress conditions and the degree at which they occurred were 
similar between Imraldi and EU Humira, showing that the degradation pattern was similar.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
As detailed in the Quality overview, the quality part of the submission (module 3) is overall of good quality 
covering all main areas satisfactorily.  
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail; all raw and starting materials including 
the cell banks used in the manufacture of Imraldi material are listed identifying where each material is 
used in the process. Information on the quality and control of these materials has been provided. Also all 
excipients used for finished product formulation comply with the Ph. Eur. An adequate process control 
system, consisting of process input and process output parameters, is in place which ensures a consistent 
routine manufacture of Imraldi. Process validation supports the conclusion that the manufacturing 
process for active substance as well as for finished product can perform effectively and reproducibly to 
produce active substance respective finished product meeting its predetermined specifications and 
quality attributes. The provided active substance and finished product batch analyses data support this 
conclusion. Comparability of the clinical Imraldi batches used in the clinical studies and the process 
validation batches has been demonstrated.  
The analytical similarity between Imraldi and Humira has been extensively addressed in accordance with 
relevant guidelines. The comparability studies address the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, 
post-translational modifications, purity/impurity profile, biological activity, as well as the degradation 
profile. As expected, some differences in quality attributes were observed, these differences have, 
however, been satisfactorily discussed and justified not to be of clinical relevance.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Imraldi is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been 
sufficiently assured.

Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Humira has been sufficiently demonstrated. From a 
quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been well 
documented and are acceptable. 
The overall Quality of Imraldi is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

CHMP recommended an additional point for investigation: 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
A comprehensive panel of in vitro ligand binding studies and bioassays were conducted for demonstrating 
the similarity of Imraldi (also referred to as SB5 thoroughout this Report), and reference product EU 
Humira. The side-by-side characterisation studies are considered suitable for the demonstration of 
biosimilarity of monoclonal antibodies (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues - EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and were 
categorized in Fab-related biological activities, Fc-related biological activities and additional supportive 
bioassays. In addition, the in vivo efficacy of SB5 and US Humira was compared in the Tg197 transgenic 
mouse model of arthritis. 
Based on the in vitro data provided, SB5 appears to be similar to EU Humira in binding and functional 
characteristics (expressed as % of relative activities) regarding the primary mode of action for 
adalimumab i.e. TNF-α (soluble and transmembrane) binding and neutralisation activity. These also 
included the assessment of Tm-TNF-α related mechanism (apoptosis) and LTα3 binding. The data support 
the similar binding and functional characteristics in terms of Fc-related functions i.e. FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, 
FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa (158V/V, 158F/F), FcγRIIIb, FcRn and C1Q binding, and complement dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Additional studies were 
performed to support the similar functionality of SB5 and EU Humira on inflammatory bowel diseases. 
According to these studies and under the study conditions, effects on regulatory macrophages, inhibition 
of cytokine release (IL-8) and apoptotic activity in TNF-treated human colon carcinoma cells can be 
considered similar between the SB5 and EU Humira. In addition, there were no differences between SB5 
and EU Humira on the inhibitory effects on TNF-α-induced endothelial VCAM expression.  
The functional similarity was supported by the in vivo efficacy study in the Tg197 transgenic mouse model 
of arthritis, closely resembling human RA pathology as a consequence of overexpression of human TNF-α.  
Intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg SB5 and US Humira (twice weekly) 
started before the onset of arthritic symptoms to evaluate the protective effect. The treatment was 
continued for 7 weeks. The treatment responses were evaluated weekly (from 3 to 10 weeks of age) 
macroscopically (macroscopic arthritis scores) and at the end of the treatment from histopathological 
samples (histopathological scores) in a blinded fashion from hind limb ankle joints. The in vivo efficacy of 
SB5 was similar to US Humira in inhibition of the arthritic pathology compared to the vehicle–treated 
mice.  The studies on secondary PD, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interactions were 
not conducted and are not deemed necessary.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics program consisted of a toxicokinetic profile comparison of SB5 and US Humira in 
cynomolgus monkeys included as part of the GLP-compliant 4-week repeat dose toxicity study, please see 
toxicology section below. Although pharmacokinetic studies are not formally requested for biosimilars in 
the EU, the toxicokinetic analysis was included for development of SB5 for the purposes of global 
markets. 
The absence of studies evaluating the distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions is consistent with CHMP guidance (Guideline on similar biological med icinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies, EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
A 4-week comparative GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted 
to support the similarity of SB5 and originator Humira (US-sourced) in a reduced toxicology study 
package for a biosimilar application. The comparison of toxicokinetics, local tolerance and potential 
immunotoxic profiles were included to the study. 
SB5 and US Humira were well tolerated at a dose level of 32 mg/kg (s.c., once weekly for 4 weeks), 
consistent with the results of originator adalimumab studies in cynomolgus monkeys and without 
unexpected findings. There were no significant or biologically meaningful treatment -related effects or 
differences between the SB5 and US Humira in clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, 
ophthalmoscopy examinations, electrocardiographs, haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry or 
urinalysis endpoints, or peripheral blood leukocyte analysis, or macro/microscopic evaluations. The minor 
sporadic changes observed in this small scale monkey study were considered not to relate to the 
treatment, but be of biological inter-individual variation, within the range of historical control data, or 
incidental in nature or procedurally related.  
Histopathology findings at injection site were similar (in type and incidence) across the SB5 and 
Humira-treated animals.  
No significant differences were seen in the immunogenicity profile (in the ADA-formation) between the 
SB5 and US Humira in cynomolgus monkeys. None of SB5 or Humira-treated animals showed a confirmed 
positive anti-drug antibody response. 1/6 US Humira-treated animals were positive according to initial 
screening on Day 22 and Day 29, but was negative in the confirmatory analysis. However, this may 
present a potentially false negative finding. The ECL analysis method may not have been sufficient for 
detecting ADA due to the drug interference.  
According to the immunophenotyping data, the SB5 is comparable to US Humira.  
Full toxicity studies were not considered necessary as SB5 is a proposed biosimilar to Humira in 
agreement with the CHMP guidelines on similar biological medicinal products, and studies on single-dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity were not conducted. 
In conclusion, SB5 can be considered similar to the originator US Humira in terms of toxicological, 
toxicokinetic and immunogenicity profiles. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to 
the environment. This is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of

medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The comparability analyses were focused on array of in vitro ligand binding studies and bioassays 
assessing the primary pharmacology characteristics. Based on the data provided, SB5 appears to be 
similar to EU Humira in the in vitro characteristics. SB5 was developed for global markets and the 
non-clinical program included the in vivo efficacy study in the transgenic mouse model of arthritis and 
toxicological/toxicokinetics study in cynomolgus monkeys using an US sourced reference product as a 
comparator. These studies overall supported the in vivo functional similarity of SB5 and US Humira in 
inhibiting the arthritic symptoms and similarity in toxicological, toxicokinetic and immunogenicity profiles. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
SB5 can be considered similar to originator Humira in terms of in vitro and in vivo functionality and of 
toxicological, toxicokinetic and immunogenicity profiles.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two clinical studies were performed in which the PK of adalimumab from SB5 was compared to that of 
EU-sourced Humira. 
• 
Pivotal PK study (SB5-G11-NHV) was a single-dose, phase 1, 3-way PK similarity study in healthy 
males and females comparing SB5 with EU-sourced Humira and US-sourced Humira. 
•  Randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study (SB5-G31-RA) in RA patients (having MTX medication), 
in which trough concentrations of adalimumab were compared between SB5 and EU-sourced 
Humira. 
Pivotal PK study in healthy subjects (SB5-G11-NHV) 
The study was conducted in Germany between May 02 (first subject signed informed consent) – Sept 02, 
2014 (last subject last visit).  
One amendment was made to the study protocol (dated Dec 09, 2013). In the amendment geometric 
means were updated to refer geometric LS Means to clarify the statistical analyses described in the 
statistical methods. This was the only change related to the PK. 
This study was a randomised, single-blind, 3-arm, parallel group, single-dose phase 1 study. A total of 
189 healthy subjects (aged 18-55 years) were enrolled to the study; 63 subjects in each of the 3 
treatment groups (i.e. in SB5 group, in EU-sourced Humira group and in US-sourced Humira group). All 
subjects completed the study. In each group, all subjects received a single dose (40 mg) of SB5, 
EU-sourced Humira, or US-sourced Humira by deep s.c. injection via PFS in the periumbilical area while 
subjects were supine.  
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at 0 (pre-dose) and at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 108, 120, 132, 
144, 168, 336 (2 weeks), 504, 672, 1008 (6 weeks), 1344, and 1680 h (= 10 weeks) post-dose.  Blood 
samples were collected for determination of ADA and Nabs to adalimumab at day 1 (pre-dose), day 15 
(360 h) and day 71 (1704 h).

• 
Primary pharmacokinetic endpoints: AUC inf, Cmax 
Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints: AUClast, AUC0-336, Tmax, apparent volume of distribution 
based on the terminal phase (Vz/F), terminal rate constant (λz), t ½, CL/F and %AUCextrap. 
For the EMA review, equivalence of the primary endpoints (AUCinf, Cmax) was determined if the 90% CI for 
the ratio of geometric LS Means of SB5 to EU-sourced Humira was within the acceptance interval of 0.8 to 
1.25. Equivalence testing using the same margin and confidence interval was also provided for the 
secondary endpoint AUC0-t (co-primary EP for FDA application).  
Point  estimates  of  the  mean  and  median  values  as  well  as  SD,  minimum  and  maximum  values  were 
presented for all secondary endpoints. 
Summary statistics for calculated PK parameters included: n, mean, SD, CV%, SEM, geometric mean, 
geometric SD, geometric CV%, 90% CI of geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum values. PK 
parameters were summarised by treatment group and listed by subject. 
For exploratory purpose, the ANOVA for the PK parameters by ADA/NAb result were performed. 
The demographic baseline characteristics were generally comparable across the three treatment groups.   
The primary objective for the EMA review was to investigate and compare the PK profiles of SB5 and 
EU-sourced Humira in healthy subjects. The mean serum concentration-time profiles were similar 
following a single s.c. injection of the studied treatments (see Figures 3.4.1.1 and 3.4.1.2).

SB5 and EU-sourced Humira. 
Figure 3.4.1.2 Mean serum concentration (µg/ml) versus nominal times (h) on 
semi-logarithmic scale of SB5 and EU-sourced Humira. 
The secondary PK endpoints were also at the same level between SB5 group and EU-sourced Humira 
group (see Table 3.4.1.1).  
No pre-dose concentrations were detected and no subjects reached the Tmax at the first sampling 
time-point. 
The extrapolated AUC was less than 20% in most subjects (extrapolated AUC was > 20% in 3 subjects 
who received SB5, in 11 subjects who received EU-sourced Humira and in 9 subjects who received 
US-sourced Humira). Only 4 extrapolated AUCs were above 30% and the reason for the great difference 
between AUCinf vs AUClast was a short sampling period (in 3 cases up to 336 h and in one case up to 672 
h). The sampling period has been long enough in most cases (no concern).

Table 3.4.1.1 Summary of PK parameters for SB5 and EU-sourced Humira (PK analysis set) 
The equivalence of the primary endpoints (AUCinf, Cmax) and also in AUClast was demonstrated; the 90% 
CI for the ratio of geometric LS Means of SB5 to EU-sourced Humira was within the acceptance interval of 
0.8 to 1.25 and including the value 1.00 in the ratios (see Table 3.4.1.2).

Table 3.4.1.2 ANOVA for PK parameters AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax comparing SB5 to EU-sourced 
Humira (PK analysis set) 
The post-dose ADA and NAb incidence was comparable between SB5 and EU-sourced Humira. (See for 
details under Clinical safety/ Immunological events). 
However, the PK data of 16 subjects (n = 9 in the SB5 group, n = 2 in the EU-sourced Humira group and 
n = 5 in the US-sourced Humira group) were excluded from the initial PK analysis (the summary statistics 
and ANOVA for PK parameters) as the regression slope could not be estimated according to protocol (Tmax 
being 1 of the last 3 points in the respective profiles).  
As there was no clear rationale to exclude Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-336 values from analysis, the Applicant 
has been asked to present a sensitivity analysis comparing AUC0-t, AUC0-336, and Cmax between treatment 
arms including these patients.

PK parameters are entirely contained in the [0.8; 1.25] interval. It was noted that the estimates in the 
SB5 group changed considerably.  
Therefore, the Applicant was asked to investigate whether the differential exclusion may actually be 
related to differences in PK between SB5 and the reference medicinal product. A thorough investigation of 
the characteristics of excluded subjects (9 from the SB5 vs 2 from EU Humira group) showed that they 
tended to have higher BMIs and ADA titres compared with non-excluded subjects, which might result in 
lower absorption and faster clearance. While the development of ADAs is a post-randomisation event (and 
thus attributable to treatment), the distribution of height, weight and body mass index is very similar 
between groups (due to randomisation). Concerning ADA status, overall analyses [including the (PK) 
excluded subjects] do not reveal a meaningful difference in overall incidence and titres of ADAs between 
treatment.  
Potential quality differences between SB5 and the reference product, which could also influence the 
absorption rate after extravascular administration, e.g. molecular weight or charge profiles, were also 
considered. However, data from extensive quality studies supports molecular similarity of SB5 and 
reference product, and the minor difference in acidic variants is not considered to translate into 
differences in biological activity. In summary, a difference in PK between SB5 and EU Humira cannot be 
concluded from this data.  
Clinical study in patients with moderate to severe RA despite MTX therapy (SB5-G31-RA) 
The study is described in Section 2.5.2. The PK results are summarized in this Section.  
The first 65% of the enrolled subjects (356 subjects) had blood samples collected for PK analysis. The PK 
analysis set included 178 patients in the SB5 group and 178 patients in the Humira (EU-sourced) group. 
Subjects self-administered 40 mg of either SB5 or EU-sourced Humira every other week s.c., up to Week 
50 (a total of 26 administrations of IP).  
The serum concentrations of adalimumab (Ctrough) were obtained prior to dosing at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 
and 24. Blood samples for immunogenicity tests were collected at the same timepoints as the PK blood 
samples and additionally at weeks 32, 40 and 52. 
Overall mean trough concentrations were similar at each time-point between the SB5 group and the 
Humira group (see Figure 3.4.1.3 and Table 3.4.1.3). The range of individual trough concentrations was 
also similar between the 2 treatment groups.

Figure 3.4.1.3 Mean (SD) serum trough (pre-dose) concentration (µg/ml)-time profiles from 
week 0 to week 24. 
The serum trough concentrations up to week 24 were comparable between SB5 and Humira groups 
among those patients with an overall negative ADA result and among those patients with an overall 
positive ADA result. 
Within each treatment group, overall mean trough concentrations in subjects with overall positive ADA 
results up to week 24 were remarkably lower than in subjects with overall negative ADA results up to 
Week 24. This was expected, as ADA formation against adalimumab is known to be accompanied by 
increased clearance and reduced exposure, as well as a possible loss of efficacy. Immunogenicity impact 
on pharmacokinetics is presented more detailed in the Safety part of this report.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamic data were evaluated in the bioequivalence studies in healthy volunteers since the 
validated PD markers do not exist for the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors. Regarding the primary PD a set of 
non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies has been performed. Studies on secondary PD have not been 
provided and are not required according to the EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
Adalimumab is a human recombinant IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) that exerts its effect by inhibiting 
TNF-α functional activity. TNF-α may exist as a soluble (sTNF-α) or a transmembrane (tmTNF-α) form.  
Elevated levels of TNF-α have been detected in the serum and in the affected joints and tissues of patients 
with the various conditions for which Humira is approved. Therefore, the mechanism of action of 
adalimumab appears to be complex formation with TNF-α, which results in decrease of its availability to 
induce inflammatory effects and to facilitate its elimination. Complexes of adalimumab and TNF-α, 
particularly tmTNF-α, may also reduce the presence of disease-promoting inflammatory cells by

mediating processes such as reverse signalling (which initiates anti-inflammatory processes), apoptosis, 
antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 
In RA, PsA, and PsO, neutralisation of soluble and transmembrane TNF-α may play an important role. On 
the other hand, in CD and UC, inhibition of tmTNF-α signalling and Fcγ receptor-mediated functions may 
play an important role as well. 
Extrapolation to originator indications is discussed in detail elsewhere in this AR.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical methods 
The Applicant has used several bioanalytical methods for determination of circulating adalimumab, 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from the serum samples of healthy 
volunteers (study SB5-G11-NHV) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, study SB5-G31-RA). For the 
ADA/Nab assays a single SB5 format is used for SB5 and Humira (EU, US) measurements both in 
validation and sample analysis. As part of the validation limited data demonstrating equal antigenicity of 
SB5 and Humira were provided, and thus further data from validation of both SB5 and Humira assays 
were requested together with information concerning the performance of both analytes in the two assay 
settings.  The applicant has provided further data as requested and all of the issues are solved. For all 
assays validation reports have been provided, yet the data across assays was not fully clear and robust.

Concerning the drug measurements, validation of the phase 1 assay (pivotal PK study) was otherwise 
adequately performed, but the statistical analysis and the method used to define calibration curves raised 
questions. These have been adequately addressed by the applicant. Furthermore, possible ADA 
interference had not been evaluated at all, which raised concerns, as many of the study individuals have 
ADAs and NAbs (almost 100% of the healthy volunteers). The applicant has provided further data to 
demonstrate that the ADAs have not had impact on biosimilarity assessment. However, from the results 
it is clear that ADAs have a significant impact on PK measurements. Thus, it is recommended that for 
future regulatory submissions that involve PK and immunogenicity assessment, the ADA interference is 
clearly taken into account and described. For the phase 3 study  ELISA assay validation data in RA matrix 
was missing, but has now been provided and the issue is solved. 
Concerning the ADA and Nab assays, the screening and confirmatory methods for samples from healthy 
volunteers originally appeared more reliable and robust than those used for the Phase 3 RA samples. The 
applicant has provided further data and clarifications to address the identified problems in validation of 
the methods for RA samples. The issues concerning ADA drug tolerance testing and the impact of the 
difference in sensitivity to SB5 and Humira on the actual ADA results have been clarified and additional 
concordance data from earlier time points have been provided. 
PK data analysis and statistical analyses 
The PK parameters were adequately calculated. The handling of the BLQ concentrations was appropriate. 
The sample size calculations, randomisations and used analysis methods were appropriate. The original 
Statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the pivotal PK study (i.e. SB5-G11-NHV) was not included in the initially 
submitted dossier and the SAP and amendment were asked to be provided by the Applicant. The Applicant 
provided the above mentioned documents and the data related to the statistical analyses presented only 
summarised in the clinical study report. 
The PK studies  
Two clinical studies were performed in which the PK of adalimumab from SB5 was compared to that of 
Humira (EU-sourced). The doses of adalimumab administered s.c. were in the pivotal PK study 40 mg as 
a single-dose and 40 mg every other week up to week 50 in the clinical study in RA patients.  The 
administration device was the PFS in both studies. 
In the pivotal PK study (SB5-G11-NHV) the primary objective was to investigate and compare the PK 
profiles of SB5 and EU-sourced Humira in healthy subjects. The healthy subjects are an adequate 
population to show the PK similarity. The choice of parallel study design was adequately justified. 
Adalimumab has approximately a two week half-life and there may have been safety concerns on 
repeated dosing due to potential immunogenicity. There were originally no exact data of the protein 
content of the test and reference product batches used in the clinical study. Consequently, the protein 
content data for the test and the reference products was asked to be provided by the Applicant. The 
Protein contents of the test product batch and the reference product batch are almost similar. 
For the primary PK parameters (i.e. AUCinf and Cmax) the 90%CI for the ratio of the test and reference 
products was within the pre-specified bioequivalence acceptance range of 80.0%-125.00% (including the 
100.00% in the ratios). The AUClast and partial AUC0-336 were also at the similar level between studied 
treatments.  
The Applicant presented a sensitivity analysis comparing AUC0-t, AUC0-336, and Cmax between treatment 
arms including 16 patients who had been formally excluded from the primary statistical analysis per 
protocol, as t max was one of the 3 last measurable time points, which was an exclusion criterion for the 
regression slope estimation. This was requested since there is no compelling rationale for excluding the 
Cmax, AUClast and AUC0-336 values of 9 subjects with SB5 and 2 subjects from the EU Humira treatment

arm from statistical analysis, as the measurements of almost all time points necessary to evaluate these 
parameters are available. While the 90% CIs of these three PK parameters are still entirely contained in 
the [0.8; 1.25]acceptance range, the estimates in the SB5 group changed considerably.Therefore, the 
Applicant was asked to investigate whether the differential exclusion may actually be related to 
differences in PK between SB5 and the reference medicinal product.  A thorough investigation of the 
characteristics of excluded subjects showed that they tended to have higher BMIs and ADA titres 
compared with non-excluded subjects, which might result in lower absorption and faster clearance. While 
the development of ADAs is a post-randomisation event (and thus attributable to treatment), the 
distribution of height, weight and body mass index is very similar between groups (due to randomisation). 
Overall analyses [including the (PK) excluded subjects] do not reveal a meaningful difference in overall 
incidence and titres of ADAs between treatment.  
Potential quality differences between SB5 and the reference product, which could also influence the 
absorption rate after extravascular administration, e.g. molecular weight or charge profiles, were also 
considered. However, data from extensive quality studies supports molecular similarity of SB5 and 
reference product, and the minor difference in acidic variants is not considered to translate into 
differences in biological activity. In summary, a difference in PK between SB5 and EU Humira cannot be 
concluded from this data. 
The PK data were obtained also from phase 3 study in RA patients, which is in line with guideline 
recommendations.  
Overall mean trough concentrations were similar between the SB5 group and the Humira group. The 
range of individual trough concentrations was also similar between the two treatment groups. The 
inter-patient variabilities in the trough concentrations were high (at steady-state the CV%s were 
56-69%), however, at the same level in both studied treatments. The Applicant was requested to perform 
direct comparison of the trough concentrations between SB5 and EU-sourced Humira, presenting point 
estimates and 90%CIs. This comparative analysis was to be provided for all visits where the PK 
measurements were done. The Applicant performed the comparative analysis in the trough 
concentrations between SB5 and EU-sourced Humira at all visits as requested. The trough concentrations 
have been within the bioequivalence criteria (i.e. within 0.8-1.25 including 1.0) at each week except at 
baseline. Consequently, the trough concentrations have been similar in RA patients. 
There were several patients both in SB5 and Humira group having no trough concentrations in one 
time-point or even in all time-points. Consequently, the reason for trough concentrations of below limit of 
quantification (BLQ) and some discussion of these low concentrations and their impact on the efficacy was 
asked to be provided. The Applicant provided very comprehensive discussion of the trough concentration 
below the BLQ. It was thought that immunogenicity had also an impact to the low concentrations, 
because most of the patients with at least one post-dose BLQ had overall ADA-positive results up to week 
24 (i.e. the clearance of adalimumab was higher in these patients).  
The Applicant thought that the existence of at least one BLQ might have an influence in efficacy; however, 
the efficacy profiles were comparable. The Applicant presented the ACR20/50/70 response rates for RA 
patients, who had at least one post-dose BLQ up to week 24 and it can be seen that the efficacy profiles 
were quite comparable. The impact of the low concentrations to the efficacy can be considered to have 
been similar in both treatment groups (the number of patients with at least one post-dose BLQ was quite 
comparable between studied treatments, The distribution of ADA and Nab status in patients having at 
least one post-dose BLQ between the two treatment groups was comparable and the efficacy was 
comparable between the treatment groups). 
There were also some excluded trough concentrations on the data at different time-points, which needed 
explanation (the number of patients in the PK population was 178 in both groups; however, the number 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 35/111 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients having pre-dose concentrations in different weeks varied from 157 to 169 in both groups. The 
reasons of exclusions were as follows: patients were discontinued from the study, due to a protocol 
deviation of PK blood sampling (i.e. within 60 minutes prior to the investigational product administration; 
drug concentration was analysed, but not included for the summary statistics for trough concentration 
analysis) and due to the PK sampling not being performed. The exclusion of the data from summary 
statistics for trough concentration analysis was in accordance with the study protocol. 
The  Applicant  was  requested  to  clarify  open  questions  regarding  the  patients  not  allocated  to  the  PK 
population, in which PK samples were taken by mistake.  The Applicant clarified adequately that none of 
the non-PK patients have undergone the complete sampling period of 24 weeks and the PK analysis has 
not been performed on these samples.  
The serum trough concentrations up to week 24 were comparable between SB5 and Humira groups 
among those patients with an overall negative ADA result and among those patients with an overall 
positive ADA result. Within each treatment group, overall mean trough concentrations in subjects with 
overall positive ADA results up to week 24 were markedly lower than in subjects with overall negative 
ADA results up to Week 24, which is consistent with the Humira SmPC. 
No clinical studies in special populations and  no in vitro  or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were 
conducted with the SB5 and this is acceptable.  
In the proposed SB5 SmPC the PK text in the Section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” is from the Humira 
SmPC. As the SB5 and Humira are considered to be biosimilar it is acceptable to use Humira SmPC text. 
The PD studies and extrapolation 
No specific PD biomarkers are available for TNFα functional studies and the data provided has been based 
on non-clinical primary pharmacodynamics studies. This is approvable since the question here is about 
biosimilar development and not of a novel treatment entity. Regarding extrapolation, the Applicant has 
provided data on the cytokine profiles in the various indications and explained TNF-α overexpression as 
being the common denominator in the Humira approved medical conditions.  
Regarding the recently approved new indications of EU-Humira, the Applicant has justified in their 
responses the extrapolation to hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) indication and in both RA and HS similar 
cytokine targets are proposed. It has been reported that cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 releasing T helper cells 
(Th17), after induction by IL-23 and IL-1β, infiltrate the dermal HS lesions. RA is considered to be one of 
the Th17-mediated diseases and the effector cytokines of Th17 cells are known to induce characteristic 
findings of RA. Thus the extrapolation between RA and HS can be considered acceptable. Also, in uveitis 
Th17 function is believed to be central in pathogenesis, which is also implied by the cytokine profile with 
elevated IL-17 and IL-22 levels in Uveitis, although their direct correlation to the Th17 pathogenesis has 
been disputed. Nevertheless, it has been shown that he numbers of TH17 cells increased during active 
uveitis/scleritis and decreased following treatment in animal experiments and IL-17 blockade reduced 
severity of inflammation in uveitis rodent models. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In the pivotal PK study the 90%CIs for the GM ratios of the primary PK parameters (i.e. AUCinf and Cmax) 
of the test and reference products was within the pre-specified bioequivalence acceptance range of 
80.0%-125.00% (including the 100.00% in the ratios).  
Initial concerns based on the differential exclusion of subjects between the SB5 and EU Humira arm and 
the results of a PK sensitivity analysis including all subjects, have been resolved.

Subjects had to take MTX for at least 6 months prior to Randomisation. A stable dose of oral or parenteral 
MTX (10-25 mg/week) was to be taken by all subjects from 4 weeks before Screening until 
End-of-Treatment visit (Week 52). The route of administration was not to be changed in this period. 
As MTX can cause folic acid deficiency, during this period subjects also had to take folic acid 5-15 
mg/week. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the equivalence of SB5 to Humira at Week 24, in 
terms of American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) response rate in subjects 
with moderate to severe RA despite MTX therapy. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• To evaluate efficacy of SB5 compared to Humira using relevant efficacy endpoints other than 
ACR20 at Week 24 in subjects with moderate to severe RA despite MTX therapy. 
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of SB5 compared to Humira in subjects with moderate to 
severe RA despite MTX therapy. 
• To evaluate PK of SB5 compared to Humira in subjects with moderate to severe RA despite MTX 
therapy. 
• To evaluate immunogenicity of SB5 compared to Humira in subjects with moderate to severe RA 
despite MTX therapy. 
• To evaluate safety and immunogenicity in subjects who transitioned to SB5 and who maintained 
Humira at Week 24 for transition sub-study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The main efficacy variable for the study is the ACR20 response. Other efficacy endpoints include the 
American College of Rheumatology 50% response criteria (ACR50), the American College of 
Rheumatology 70% response criteria (ACR70), individual components of the ACR improvement criteria, 
DAS28, major clinical response, and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response (good 
response, moderate response or no response). The ACR20 response indicates: 
• At least a 20% improvement from baseline in swollen joint count (66 joint count) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 40/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• At least a 20% improvement from baseline in tender joint count (68 joint count) 
• At least a 20% improvement from baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 criteria: 
- Subject pain assessment using a 100 mm VAS 
- Subject global assessment using a 100 mm VAS 
- Physician global assessment using a 100 mm VAS 
- Subject assessment of disability using the HAQ-DI 
- Acute phase reactant level (CRP) 
The ACR50 and ACR70 indicate a 50% and 70% improvement, respectively, in the criteria. 
Other secondary outcome measures were individual components of the ACR improvement criteria; 
decrease in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28); major clinical response; the European League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) response (good response, moderate response or no response); continuous ACR-N 
and the AUC of ACR-N; AUC of change from baseline in DAS28; numeric index of the ACR response 
(ACR-N); structural joint damage (single posteroanterior and dorsoplantar X-ray image of each wrist and 
foot respectively) and the joint erosion score, the joint space narrowing (JSN) score and the modified total 
Sharp score (mTSS). 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
A unique subject number was assigned to subjects at Screening. The subject number was used to register 
the subject using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) and the subject was then randomised (in 
a ratio of 1:1) to either SB5 or Humira. At Week 24, subjects receiving Humira were randomised again in 
a 1:1 ratio to either continue on Humira or be transitioned to SB5. Subjects receiving SB5 continued to 
receive SB5 but they also followed the randomisation procedure to maintain blinding. These 
randomisations occurred according to a computer-generated randomisation scheme which randomised 
subjects at a centre-level. If a subject was withdrawn the randomisation number(s) were not re-used. At 
each study visit the Investigator or designee contacted the IWRS and an appropriate number of codes was 
provided. These codes indicated which prefilled syringes should be dispensed to the subject. 
Statistical methods 
Randomised set (RAN) consisted of all subjects who received a randomisation number at the 
Randomisation visit. Full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all subjects who were randomised at the 
Randomisation visit. Subjects who did not qualify for randomisation and were inadvertently randomised 
into the study were excluded from the FAS, provided these subjects do not receive IP during that study 
phase. Per-protocol set 1 (PPS1) consisted of all FAS subjects who completed the Week 24 visit and 
adhered to the IP regimen within the range of 80-120% of both the expected number of IP 
administrations and the expected sum of MTX doses without any major protocol deviations that have 
impact on the efficacy assessment. The PPS1 was considered the primary analysis set. Per-protocol set 2 
(PPS2) consisted of all FAS subjects who completed the Week 52 visit and had an adherence (through 
Week 52) within the range of 80-120% of both the expected number of IP administrations and the 
expected sum of MTX doses without any major protocol deviations that have impact on the efficacy 
assessment. Safety set (SAF) comprised subjects who received at least one dose of IP during the study

phase. Pharmacokinetic population comprised all subjects in the SAF who had at least one 
pharmacokinetic sample collected. 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate equivalence in the ACR20 response rate between 
SB5 and Humira at Week 24 for the PPS1 by employing a randomisation-based nonparametric analysis of 
covariance. 
The corresponding 95% CIs of the treatment difference in terms of ACR20 response rate were estimated 
using non-parametric analysis that controlled for region as a factor and baseline CRP value as a covariate. 
Equivalence between the two treatment groups was declared if the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference in 
ACR20 response rate between SB5 and Humira was entirely contained within the equivalence margin of 
[-15%, 15%].  
As the ACR20 response rate is expected to be around 50% at Week 24 based on the historic data, the 
proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response approximately follows a normal distribution. Hence the 
proportion was treated as a continuous variable. The difference in proportions was weighted by the 
number of observations pertaining to each region and the variance was estimated under the assumption 
of the different variation between two treatment groups within region.  
A supportive analysis using a time-response model with the ACR20 response was used to further 
investigate the treatment difference during the time course of the study period up to Week 24 for the 
PPS1. A time-response model estimates the separate time-response curves for each treatment group 
over the time course of the study. The 2-norm measures squared differences across all time-points for the 
two treatment group. Using the time-response modelling on the historical data, the 95% CI for the 
2-norm of the treatment difference was calculated as [128.61%, 201.53%]. The equivalence margin was 
defined as 64.31%, which is half of the lower bound of the 95% CI for the treatment effect. The 
equivalence was concluded if the upper limit of 95% CI for the 2-norm of the difference between SB5 and 
Humira was less than 64.31%. 
The same analysis conducted for the PPS1 population was performed for the FAS to explore the 
robustness of the results, i.e. available data analysis (no imputation, i.e., subjects with missing data at 
Week 24 excluded from the analysis). The other scheduled sensitivity analyses were: non-responder 
analysis and multiple imputation method for missing data imputation and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) and ANCOVA methods to get 95% CI for the difference. 
For  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  and  a  supportive  analysis  using  a  time-response  model,  missing 
American  College  of  Rheumatology  20%  response  criteria  (ACR20)  was  not  imputed.  Non-responder 
imputation method was used for missing ACR20 responses for the FAS population. 
When the same analysis as the primary efficacy analysis was repeated for the FAS, missing components 
in each American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response were imputed using multiple imputation 
method that assumes missing-at-random (MAR) and the missing data of subjects who withdrew from the 
study with the primary reasons of an adverse event (AE) or lack of efficacy were imputed with the 
assumption of missing-not-at-random (MNAR). If subjects were discontinued due to an AE or lack of 
efficacy, these subjects were assumed to have their change worsen by certain degree of score in the 
ACR20 components.

The proportions of subjects with medical/surgical history and continuing medical conditions were 78.2% 
vs. 88.3% in the SB5 and Humira treatment groups, respectively. The most commonly reported medical 
history and continuing medical conditions by SOC were surgical and medical procedures (48.0% of 
subjects in the SB5 treatment group vs. 55.7% of subjects in the Humira treatment group), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (35.1% vs. 39.6% of subjects), and vascular disorders 
(33.6% vs. 45.1% of subjects).

Conduct of the Study 
There was 1 amendment made to the protocol. This amendment made only administrative changes to the 
protocol. 
A total of 225 (41.4%) subjects had at least 1 major PD; 107 subjects in the SB5 treatment group and 118 
subjects in the Humira treatment group. A total of 39 (7.2%) subjects were excluded from PPS1 due to 
major PDs. The most common major PDs that led to exclusion from PPS1 were eligibility and entry criteria 
(14 [5.2%] subjects in the SB5 vs. 7 [2.6%] subjects in the Humira treatment groups) and visit schedule 
criteria (3 [1.1%] subjects in the SB5 vs. 5 [1.8%] subjects in the Humira treatment groups). A total of 
67 (12.3%) subjects were excluded from PPS2 due to major PDs. The most common major PDs that led 
to exclusion from PPS2 were visit schedule criteria (25 [9.2%] subjects in the SB5 vs. 15 [5.5%] subjects 
in the Humira overall treatment groups; among subjects in Humira overall, 7 [5.6%] subjects in the 
Humira/SB5 vs. 8 [6.2%] subjects in the Humira/Humira treatment groups) and eligibility and entry 
criteria (14 [5.2%] subjects in the SB5 vs. 7 [2.6%] subjects in the Humira overall treatment groups; 
among subjects in Humira overall, 4 [3.2%] subjects in the Humira/SB5 vs. 3 [2.3%] subjects in the 
Humira/Humira treatment groups).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The groups were equivalent in efficacy in the primary analysis (PPS1 population) for the adjusted 
difference in the ACR20 response rate at Week 24, the 95% CI for difference being well within ±15% 
acceptance range (Table 3.4.5.7). The sensitivity of the analysis was shown in the FAS population, the 
Assessment report

outcome meeting the pre-defined equivalence criteria as well (Table 3.4.5.8). Thus, the primary objective 
for the study was met. The responder rates were 72.4% (173/239) for SB5 and 72.2% (171/237) for 
Humira. The adjusted treatment difference in ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was 0.1% and the 95% CI 
of the adjusted treatment difference was [−7.83%, 8.13%]. This data supports the equivalence in 
efficacy between the treatments. 
Table 2.5.2.5: Primary Analysis of ACR20 Response Rate at Week 24 (Per-protocol Set 1) 
In the FAS population the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response at Week 24 was 68.0% 
(183/269) for SB5 and 67.4% (184/273) for Humira with the estimated difference in proportions of 0.8% 
when the non-responder analysis was applied and the 95% CI of the adjusted treatment difference of 
[−7.03%, 8.56%] (Table 2.5.2.6). 
Table 2.5.2.6: Analysis of ACR20 Response Rate at Week 24; Non-responder Analysis (Full 
Analysis Set) 
The data was equivalent also in the FAS population when no imputation of the missing data of the patients 
withdrawn was performed, the responder rate being 71.5% (183/256) for SB5 and 71.3% (184/258) for 
Humira, resulting in the 95% CI of -7.733- 7.789 for the difference between the groups when a 
missing-at-random was assumed and to the 95% CI of -8.03 - 7.59 with the pattern mixture model.  
The time-response curves of SB5 and Humira up to Week 24, showing the ACR20 response over time, 
were estimated to be equivalent and supported the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis. The 
treatment difference of the 2-norm was 8.07 and the 95% CI of the treatment difference was −11.884 - 
28.022, where the upper limit 28.022 was less than the pre-specified equivalence margin of 64.31. Thus, 
the robustness of the primary analysis was also corroborated by this analysis.

Since at week 24 a plateau in treatment effect seems to be evident, it is also of interest to evaluate the 
earlier time course of this measure, which appears fairly similar also in the sensitive, steep part of the 
response curve (see below).

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary efficacy variables at Week 24 (ACR50 and ACR70 response, ACR-N, AUC of ACR-N up to 
Week 24, DAS28 score, AUC of the Change in DAS28 from Baseline up to Week 24, EULAR response) were 
comparable between the SB5 and Imralditreatment groups.   
The secondary efficacy variables at Week 52 comparing SB5 group and the subjects continuing with 
Humira after Week 24 showed results slightly exceeding upper boundary in 95% CI for the difference in 
the ACR20 response. The other secondary outcomes at Week 52 (ACR50 and ACR70, ACR-N, DAS28, 
EULAR) between the groups were comparable. 
ACR50 and ACR70 Response Rates at Week 24 were comparable in both PPS1 (Table 2.5.2.7) and FAS 
population (Table 2.5.2.8).

Table  2.5.2.8:  Analysis  of  ACR50  and  ACR70  Response  Rates  at  Week  24;  Non-responder 
Analysis (Full Analysis Set) 
The proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response rate at Week 52 for the PPS2 was 76.9% (163/212) 
in the SB5 and 71.2% (79/111) in the Humira/Humira treatment groups. The adjusted treatment 
difference in ACR20 response rate at Week 52 was 5.6% [95% CI: −4.63%, 15.90%] between the SB5 
and Humira/Humira treatment groups. In the FAS population the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 
response at Week 52 was 71.7% (193/269) in the SB5 and 70.5% (91/129) in the Humira/Humira 
treatment groups. The adjusted treatment difference in ACR20 response rate at Week 52 with the 
non-responder analysis was 1.2% [95% CI: −8.34%, 10.75%] between the SB5 and Humira/Humira 
treatment groups. 
The proportion of subjects achieving ACR50 response rate at Week 52 for the PPS2 was 49.1% (104/212) 
in the SB5 and 51.4% (57/111) in the Humira/Humira treatment groups. The adjusted treatment 
difference in ACR50 response rate at Week 52 was −2.9% [95% CI: −14.46%, 8.69%] between the SB5 
and Humira/Humira treatment groups. The respective adjusted treatment difference in ACR70 response 
rate at Week 52 was 0.3% [95% CI: −10.25%, 10.86%].  Both ACR 50 and ACR 70 were preserved within 
the exploratory equivalence margins (defined for ACR20, week 24: -15%,15%) This was observed in the 
PPS2 as well as in the FAS and underlines similarity of long term efficacy of SB5 and Humira. Of note, 
patients who switched from Humira to SB5 at week 24 were not considered for this assessment. The mean 
ACR-N at Week 24 was 40.17 in the SB5 treatment group and 39.58 in the Humira treatment group. The 
mean ACR-N at Week 52 was 48.42 in the SB5 and 46.14 in the Humira/Humira treatment groups. The 
treatment difference in the LSMeans and its 95% CI for ACR-N at Week 24 was 0.4 [−4.61, 5.34]. The 
treatment difference in the LSMeans and its 95% CI for ACR-N at Week 52 was 2.2 [−4.33, 8.82] between 
the SB5 and Humira/Humira. 
The mean AUC of ACR-N up to Week 24 was 4834.85 in the SB5 treatment group and 4688.04 in the 
Humira treatment group. The treatment difference in the LSMeans and its 95% CI for AUC of ACR-N up to 
Week 24 was 127.7 [−461.07, 716.37]. 
The mean AUC of the change in DAS28 from Baseline up to Week 24 was −333.74 in the SB5 treatment 
group and −324.86 in the EU Humira treatment group. The treatment difference in LSMeans and its 95% 
CI for AUC of change in DAS28 from Baseline up to Week 24 was −7.7 [−36.02, 20.66]. The mean change 
in the DAS28 score from Baseline at Week 24 was −2.74 in the SB5 treatment group and −2.68 in the 
Humira treatment group. The mean change in DAS28 from Baseline at Week 52 was −3.05 in the SB5 and 
−2.92 in the Humira/Humira treatment groups. The treatment difference in the LSMeans and its 95% CI

for DAS28 at Week 24 was −0.04 [−0.26, 0.17], which was contained within the pre-defined equivalence 
margins of [−0.6, 0.6]. The treatment difference in the LSMeans and its 95% CI for DAS28 at Week 52 
was −0.10 [−0.38, 0.18] between the SB5 and Humira/Humira, which was contained within the 
pre-defined equivalence margins of [−0.6, 0.6]. Similarity in both secondary DAS28 measures could 
hence been shown. Data was only provided for FAS. Furthermore no relevant changes between Humira 
and SB5 can be derived from an analysis of the AUC of the change in DAS28 from baseline to week 24. 
At Week 24, the proportion of subjects who had a good EULAR response was 34.1% in the SB5 and 34.6% 
in the Humira treatment groups, and a moderate EULAR response was 59.2% and 58.8%, respectively. 
The proportion of subjects who had no EULAR response was 6.7% and 6.6% in the SB5 and Humira 
treatment groups, respectively. At Week 52, the proportion of subjects who had a good EULAR response 
was 47.8% in the SB5, 46.3% in the Humira overall, 46.6% in the Humira/SB5, and 46.0% in the 
Humira/Humira treatment groups, and a moderate EULAR response was 45.7%, 46.3%, 47.5%, and 
45.2%, respectively. The proportion of subjects who had no EULAR response was 6.5%, 7.4%, 5.9%, and 
8.9%, respectively. 
The mean change in mTSS from Baseline at Week 52 was 0.17 in the SB5 and 0.50 in the Humira/Humira 
treatment groups. The adjusted treatment difference in LSMeans and the 95% CI in mTSS at Week 52 
was −0.31 [95% CI: –0.843, 0.224] between the SB5 and Humira/Humira treatment groups.

Subgroup analysis by anti-drug antibody status 
The ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was similar between the SB5 and EU Humira treatment groups 
among subjects who had an overall negative ADA result up to Week 24, with 78.7% (118/150) subjects 
and 74.1% (117/158) subjects achieving an ACR20 response in the SB5 and EU Humira treatment 
groups, respectively. The adjusted treatment difference and its 95% CI in ACR20 response rate at Week 
24 among subjects with an overall negative ADA result was 5.7% [−3.8%, 15.2%]. The ACR20 response 
rate at Week 24 was lower in the SB5 treatment group than in the EU Humira treatment group among 
subjects who had an overall positive ADA result up to Week 24, with an overall positive ACR20 result in 
57.5% of patients (42/73) in the SB5 treatment group and in 71.2% of patients (52/73) in the EU Humira

treatment group. The adjusted treatment difference and its 95% CI in ACR20 response rate at Week 24 
among subjects with an overall positive ADA result was −17.5% [−33.3%, −1.8%]. There was a 
significant interaction in ACR20 response rate at Week 24 between treatment and ADA status (p-value = 
0.015). 
Within the SB5 treatment group, the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 in subjects with an overall positive 
ADA result up to Week 24 (57.5%) was lower than in subjects with an overall negative ADA result up to 
Week 24 (78.7%). However, the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was comparable within the EU Humira 
treatment group between subjects with an overall positive ADA result up to Week 24 (71.2%) and 
subjects with an overall negative ADA result up to Week 24 (74.1%). 
The ACR50 and ACR70 response rates at Week 24 were similar between the SB5 and Humira treatment 
groups in both overall positive and negative ADA subjects. 
Table 2.5.2.10: ANCOVA for ACR20 Response at Week 24 by 24-week ADA Results and 
Treatment (Per-Protocol Set 1) 
(For further details, see under Clinical safety/ immunogenicity events) 
The subgroup analysis by baseline CRP level, age, and demographic characteristics (region and gender) 
did not show significant interaction with the treatment. 
The Applicant has presented comparative data whether the difference between groups in ADA positive 
patients in favour of Humira will remain in longer term after Week 24. Since the quality data robustly 
demonstrates the similarity between the products, and since the incidence of neutralizing antibody 
formation as well as titers and neutralizing capacity are similar between the products, the chance finding 
could be assumed. Furthermore, even though the ACR response (categorical variable) in ADA positive 
treatment groups was consistently lower in the SB5 treated patients, the difference was very small when 
DAS28 (continuous variable) analysis was used. Thus, the higher ACR responses in ADA positive Humira 
group could be considered an isolated finding that is not compatible with ADA results, pharmacokinetics 
or the DAS28 results. Based on the ACR20 score in each visit up to Week 52 the ACR score improved even 
though the increased number of NAb positive patients was diagnosed. Thus, any clear withering effect in 
NAb-positive patients was not seen. Furthermore, in DAS28 score no NAb associated difference was seen 
between SB5 and Humira groups up to Week 52. In addition, fluctuation in ACR scores was seen excluding 
systematic impact of NAb positivity on outcome between treatments. Thus, these findings do not exclude 
the biosimilarity claim.

Summary of main study(ies) 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well 
as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Title: A Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel Group, Multicentre Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, 
Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity of SB5 Compared to Humira in Subjects with 
Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis despite Methotrexate Therapy 
Study identifier 
SB5-G31-RA (protocol number), 2013-005013-13 (EudraCT number) 
Design 
Randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre clinical study  
The study was composed of two distinct periods. A total of 544 subjects with 
moderate to severe RA despite MTX therapy were first randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive either SB5 40 mg (n=271) or EU Humira 40 mg (n=273) every other 
week  via  subcutaneous  injection.  At  Week  24,  subjects  receiving  EU  Humira 
were  randomized  again  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  continue  on  Humira  40  mg 
(Humira/Humira) (n=129) or transitioned to SB5 40 mg (Humira/SB5) (n=125) 
every other week up to Week 50. Subjects receiving SB5 continued to receive 
SB5 40 mg up to Week 50 but they also followed the randomization procedure 
to maintain blinding. The expected study duration per individual subject was 60 
weeks after randomization (52 weeks of active treatment and 8 weeks of safety 
follow-up).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The primary concern in designing biosimilarity study is to select a target population that is the most 
sensitive and homogeneous in detecting differences between the test and reference products. Separate

study in paediatric patients is not usually required in the biosimilarity setting. The applicant has selected 
the population to cover the age group from 18 to 75 years, which is acceptable. 
Supportive study(ies) 
Extrapolation of indications 
The Applicant intends to claim the same therapeutic indications for the proposed biosimilar SB5 as 
granted for Humira in the EU. The SB5 development program included direct physicochemical and 
biological comparisons of SB5, EU and US sourced Humira, a three-way comparison of the three products 
in a Phase I PK study as well as a confirmatory clinical Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety/tolerability, and immunogenicity of SB5 compared to EU Humira in subjects with moderate to 
severe RA despite Methotrexate therapy. In the dossier, a reference is made to the “Guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical 
and clinical issues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1), which outlines the possibility for 
extrapolation for clinical data to other indications of the reference product, when biosimilar comparability 
has been demonstrated by thorough physicochemical and structural analyses as well as by in vitro 
functional tests complemented with clinical data (efficacy and safety and/or PK/PD data) in one 
therapeutic indication.  
To support this strategy the Applicant has provided a separate document which includes the result of a 
thorough literature review of the mechanism of action of adalimumab to justify extrapolation of the 
efficacy and safety data across all its approved therapeutic indications. 
Firstly the role of TNF-α and its receptors in the pathogenesis of the different authorised indications is 
discussed, followed by a discussion on the current knowledge of the relationship between adalimumab 
structure and target/receptor interactions, and its relevance for the extrapolation of indications, including 
a discussion on the similarity exercise focusing on these attributes. Finally, the known efficacy and safety 
profiles of the reference product in the extrapolated indications will be discussed. The Applicant considers 
that the data provided in this MAA provides adequate justification to extrapolate the date obtained in RA 
patients to all other claimed indications.

From the quality perspective (including the in-vitro assays) the Company has performed a sound and 
comprehensive biosimilarity exercise. Up to 47 batches of EU Humira have been extensively characterised 
and the data were used for a statistical evaluation of the similarity ranges. The side-by side comparison 
of SB5 clinical and process validation batches with EU -(as well as with US- and Korean sourced) Humira 
batches included a quite exhaustive panel of standard and state-of-the art techniques which has been 
used for characterisation and comparison of relevant quality attributes of the adalimumab molecule. This 
panel includes analytical tests for physicochemical features whereas the biological profile of adalimumab 
was covered by tests for Fab activities (TNF-α binding and neutralisation assays, apoptosis assay) and Fc 
activities (binding to the FcγRs and FcRn, binding to C1q, ADCC and CDC assays).  
It is believed that neutralisation of sTNF and tmTNF is of key relevance for the efficacy of adalimumab in 
RA by preventing TNF from inducing TNFR-mediated cellular functions. Regarding IBD it is currently 
considered that more mechanisms are likely involved. Therefore, a panel of additional biological assays 
was submitted for justifying extrapolation of indications (inhibition of IL-8 cytokine release, induction of 
regulatory macrophages, T-cell anti-proliferation, inhibition of adhesion molecule expression, binding to 
transmembrane TNF-α, FcγRIIIa 158 F/F type binding, FcγRIIIb binding, and LTα3 (TNF-β) binding). The 
necessity of studying these mechanisms comparatively is primarily deducted from observations that 
other TNF alpha antagonists display differing levels (or even lack) of efficacy in IBD indications, 
suggesting that a wider range of mechanisms could be involved. However, it needs to be emphasized that 
the relative contribution of these various effects is currently unknown. 
From a non-clinical perspective the extrapolation of indications seems appropriate for this type of 
monoclonal antibody based targeted therapy. It also needs to be recognised that available non-clinical 
pharmacological models for the proposed indications are developed for proof of concept purposes and 
usually lack discriminatory power for purposes of testing biosimilarity. Consequently, physicochemical 
comparability together with comparative in vitro studies are considered sensitive and appropriate 
comparative testing parameters for extrapolation purposes.  
There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Humira between healthy 
subjects and patients across the various approved Humira indications, hence comparatively evaluating PK 
in a single dose healthy volunteer study and in a subset of RA patients supports. Comparable PK of SB5 
and Humira has been demonstrated in both models (a pivotal comparative PK study in healthy volunteers, 
supported by similar results of mean Ctrough levels in a representative subset of RA patients). A drug level 
Assessment report

of 5 μg/mL has been reported to have a predictive value of good clinical response in both RA and PsA 
patients (Pouw et al., 2015; Vogelzang et al., 2014). Also in CD and UC patients, adalimumab serum 
levels were related to clinical response (Karimiris et al., 2009; Roblin et al., 2014).   
For the choice of its efficacy and safety models the company refers to EU guidance recommending 
comparative parallel design in treatment-naïve patients as the most sensitive design for a premarketing 
study to assess potential differences in the risk of immunogenicity (EMA “Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues”) and reiterates 
that the choice of patient population for the comparative clinical efficacy/safety study has been endorsed 
during scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/430098/2013). 
Indeed RA is the indication for which Humira obtained initial marketing authorization and it is the 
indication for which most clinical trial experience has been accumulated, hence the external validity of 
results, can be considered high. The disease pathology of RA and the role of TNF-α inhibition are known. 
Furthermore adalimumab exhibits a reasonable effect size in moderate to severe RA, which among the 
indications for which Humira is indicated for is only topped by PASI 75 response rates in Psoriasis studies. 
The company argues that, in terms of representativeness, by far most patients treated with Humira suffer 
from RA.  This argument can only be partly followed, since the model most sensitive to allow for 
extrapolation to other indications should be chosen, not the model representative of what most 
adalimumab treated patients suffer from. However, the chosen model together with the convincing 
clinical similarity data is considered sensitive enough to allow for extrapolation to all other indications of 
Humira.  
Safety related outcomes mediated by TNFα suppression are considered comparable across indications. 
Comparative immunogenicity has clinically been evaluated in two populations (healthy volunteers and RA 
patients) in addition to structural and functional analyses in earlier drug development stages. 
In summary, provided outstanding issues can be clarified, the totality of data suggests that SB5 is 
biosimilar to Humira. Complemented by the results obtained by functional assays to comparatively study 
the mechanism of action proposed for IBD indications (inhibition of IL-8 cytokine release, induction of 
regulatory macrophages, T-cell anti-proliferation, inhibition of adhesion molecule expression, binding to 
transmembrane TNF-α, FcγRIIIa 158 F/F type binding, FcγRIIIb binding, and LTα3 (TNF-β) binding) and 
clinical models chosen to investigate biosimilarity are considered sufficiently sensitive to support 
extrapolation.  
Regarding the extrapolation to Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) the Applicant has addressed that the 
elevated skin tissue TNF-α level has been observed in this condition. The pathogenesis in this condition is 
proposed to be different, but it has similar elements with the rheumatoid conditions regarding the tmTNF 
signaling, apoptosis characteristics and in suppression of cytokine secretion. The cytokine expression 
profile between HS and rheumatoid conditions is though somewhat different, TNF-α overexpression, 
however, being the common denominator between these diseases. It has been reported that T helper 
cells (Th17) releasing cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 infiltrate the dermal HS lesions. RA is considered to be 
Th17-mediated disease as well. The target for adalimumab, TNF-α induces CD4+ T cell IL-17 production 
indirectly in response to increased IL-1β and IL-6 levels by monocytes in a TNFRI and TNFRII dependent 
manner. Thus, the described pathogenesis supports the similar primary mechanism of action for 
adalimumab in both conditions. The non-clinical results in tmTNF-α related binding activity did not show 
significant differences between SB5 and US Humira. The extrapolation to HS is sufficiently justified by the 
same target molecules and similar pathomechanisms. The Applicant has extended the claim for indication 
to uveitis, in which Th17 function is also believed to be central in its pathogenesis.

Usability of the device 
The Applicant has performed three formative studies in users in parallel with the device development. The 
purpose of these studies was to get response from the users in the understanding of the instructions of 
use, on their practical ability to use the device by injection on a practice pad and to design outer and inner 
carton by user preferences. The Applicant had made corrective actions after each study and these 
improvements were implemented prior to human factors validation study. 
Altogether 83 subjects were enrolled and they represented patients, healthcare professionals and 
caregivers. The group of patients included those with and without previous experience of PFS use and 
those who did not have any experience on injections. The patients were selected appropriately to cover 
the most of the indications applied for the current product, the largest group being RA patients (25) and 
the majority of the patients (31 of 40) had disease-related impairment reflecting adequately the target 
population for the SB5 single-dose Safety PFS device. 
According to the Applicant no device failures or use-related risks (adverse events or needle sticks) to 
necessitate further changes to the PFS device were observed during the human factors validation study. 
The Applicant has provided full Formative and Human Factor Validation study reports and the data on the 
improvements performed to the device based on the risks observed during the Formative studies. The 
HFS was considered adequate to mitigate the possible risks in the use of the device and the corrections 
performed are appropriate for the improved usability of the device. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal  phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety study (SB5-G31-RA) was a randomised, double-blind, 
parallel group, multicentre study to demonstrate biosimilarity between the SB5 adalimumab and EU 
Humira in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving concomitant methotrexate therapy 
and folic acid supplement. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the equivalence of SB5 
to Humira at Week 24, in terms of American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) 
response rate in subjects with moderate to severe RA despite MTX therapy. The secondary objectives 
included the evaluation of efficacy, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and PK of SB5 compared to 
Humira using several other endpoints (e.g. ACR20 at 52 weeks, ACR50, ACR70, and DAS28) at Weeks 24 
and 52. At week 24, patients in the Humira treatment group were re-randomised either to continue with 
Humira or to switch to SB5, to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in subjects after 
switching the treatment. The presented primary and secondary objectives were typical of this type of 
study and are considered acceptable. The switch of the treatments to clarify the interchangeability 
between the biosimilar and originator is not a requirement within EU, but supports the Applicants global 
program, and is as such acceptable. The main long term data for the EU marketing authorization consists 
of the comparison between SB5 and Humira/Humira treatment groups at Week 52. 
The selection of the study target population of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis patients having 
incomplete response from the methotrexate treatment was approved in the CHMP scientific advice and 
was also according to the EMA guidance on the selection of sensitive clinical models in biosimilar mAb 
development, and as such is acceptable. By the CHMP scientific advice the study population was 
considered to be sensitive enough model to allow observation of clinically relevant differences between 
the biosimilar candidate and the reference medicinal product. Overall the study design (target population 
and primary outcome time point) can be considered sensitive to detect differences between treatments.  
The equivalence margin of ±15% for the difference in the ACR20 response rate between groups was 
approved by the CHMP scientific advice and was statistically justified by the Applicant in the dossier. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 63/111 
 
 
 
 
Applicant  conducted a meta-analysis of two studies by Keystone (2004) and Weinblatt (2003) and 
derived an equivalence margin of ±15% based on fixed-effects model estimate of 0.3832 for the 
difference between adalimumab and placebo with a 95% CI [0.3060, 0.4605] using the Mantel-Haenszel 
weight. By the rule to preserve 50% of the clinical effect the lower boundary of the 95% CI was selected 
resulting in 0.15 (= 0.5 × 0.3060) and ±15% margin for the equivalence and is considered justified by the 
statistical rational. However, the justification of the clinical non-relevance of the equivalence margin is not 
explained by the Applicant as required by the EMA guideline on biosimilars 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1). The 95% CI ACR20 proportion rate being well within the 
predefined equivalence margin no concerns pertaining to biosimilarity are present, and therefore further 
justification from the applicant is not required. Furthermore, the clinical justification of non-relevance 
might be difficult to prove for the endpoint, which is a proportional unit and does not directly measure the 
improvement in the effect size for the continuous variable. The ACR20 response rate in the current Phase 
3 study was slightly (~5%) higher, but of the same magnitude, compared to the respective values in the 
two studies referred to in the equivalence margin estimation, supporting the selected criteria for the 
biosimilarity. From the statistical standpoint in the primary endpoint analysis the adjusted estimates of 
the treatment effect should be compared to unadjusted estimates as addressed by the EMA guidance on 
adjustment for baseline covariates (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013). The Applicant has provided the requested 
data, which shows comparable results between the adjusted and unadjusted estimates. The selection of 
baseline CRP as a covariate for the pivotal study ANCOVA analysis is supported, since it correlates with 
the RA disease activity.  
The sensitivity analyses applied by the Applicant are acceptable, and the approach to first study the 
primary outcome in the PPS population with the sensitivity analysis evaluating the robustness of results 
in FAS population, is acceptable. The handling of the missing data is according to the EMA Guideline on 
Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical Trials (EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev. 1.).  
The study was un-blinded for a limited number of prospectively selected sponsor representatives to 
conduct the Week 24 pivotal efficacy analysis. The personnel were prospectively assigned to the blinded 
and unblinded staff members by their functions to carry out interim pivotal analysis. Some of the duties 
of the unblinded members were transferred to the blinded staff members not participating in the Week 24 
analysis. The Applicant confirms that the trial was kept blinded up to 52 weeks. Treatment codes and 
results were protected for blinding up to Week 52. The computer-generated randomization at centre level 
was conducted by using Interactive Web Response system (IWRS). The Applicant has provided 
biostatistical addendum undersigned at the 11th of February, 2014, and full randomization protocol, 
which describes the use of blocked randomization schedule with stratifying factors and on demand 
allocation of blocks in both initial and re-randomization randomization scheme. In general, the statistical 
protocol was according to the guidelines and the CHMP scientific advice received. 
The study population for the primary analysis (PPS1) contained 239 and 237 study subjects in the SB5 
and Humira groups, respectively. For the FAS population 269 and 273 patients were randomised to the 
SB5 and Humira groups, respectively. The discontinuation rate was low in both groups being under 10% 
and no significant imbalance between the groups was observed regarding the discontinuations although 
the withdrawal rate due to adverse events was somewhat higher in the Humira group. Demographic and 
disease- or treatment-related baseline characteristics were well balanced between the study arms. 
However, it seems that surgical treatments and other continuing medical conditions were slightly more 
frequently reported in the Humira group, but the difference in numbers is not expected to have impact on 
the study outcome. However, a significant difference in mean age (49.8 (SB5) vs. 52.5 years (Humira), 
p-value = 0.010) was present. There was also a numerical, but not statistically significant trend for a 
higher number of patients aged ≥ 65 in the Humira treatment arm 10.7% (SB5) vs. 14.7% (Humira). 
Subgroup analyses performed by the applicant revealed that among the subjects aged ≥ 65 years, 68.0% 
(17/25) and 71.4% (25/35) of the subjects achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24 in the SB5 and 
Assessment report

Humira treatment groups, respectively and thus there was no significant interaction in ACR20 response 
rate at Week 24 between treatment and age group (p-value = 0.865). 
The Applicant addresses that no rescue medicines were provided to the patients during the study and the 
criteria for the prohibited and permitted concomitant treatment were pre-determined. The mean weekly 
dose level of MTX was similar at the initiation between the groups. However, several major protocol 
deviations in the MTX treatment were seen. The protocol deviation in the MTX treatment criteria was 
observed in 24 events in the Imraldi group and 26 events in the Humira group. The Applicant has clarified 
the criteria to exclude subjects from the study based on the IP and MTX compliance criteria, which have 
been followed consistently in the respective study populations (PPS, FAS, PK, and SAS). In addition, since 
the study outcome is comparable in FAS and PPS populations the patients excluded by these criteria do 
not have any impact on the results. The reported use of concomitant medication did not differ significantly 
between the groups during the study. According to the Applicant glucocorticoids were used by 
approximately half of the study subjects (49.6% vs. 45.1% of subjects in SB5 and Humira groups 
respectively) and acetic acid derivatives and related substances by 23.9% and 20.5% of subjects in SB5 
and Humira groups, respectively.  
Based on the Applicants notification the clinical studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and they were consistent with the  International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP)” (ICH E6(R1)) and applicable local 
regulatory requirements and laws. A high number of protocol deviations was reported with a possibility to 
variable practices in the clinical trial conduct in the countries outside EU (Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Ukraine, South Korea), the overall major protocol deviation frequency being 39.5% and 43.2% in SB5 
and Humira groups, respectively, in the pivotal efficacy trial (SB5-G31-RA). Regarding the center or 
region effect on the results the Applicant had performed an Analysis of Covariance for ACR20 response at 
Week 24 with treatment by Region (EU vs. non-EU) in PP population, which gave non-significant 
statistical significance. In addition, the same most highly recruiting site of the current pivotal study was 
included in the pivotal study of the same Company for an earlier biosimilar application for the same 
indication, without critical issues to be found in the recent GCP-inspection. Therefore, the GCP-inspection 
of the current pivotal study was not pursued further. The Applicant has appropriately explained the 
discrepancy in the number of centres reported to be included in the study by the slow CTA approval and 
late start of the trial in some planned trial sites. 
The study data was collected for 52 weeks which is considered adequate for comparing the long term 
efficacy and safety between the biosimilar and reference medicinal product.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A single pivotal clinical study (SB5-G31-RA) conducted showed equivalence in the primary outcome, 
ACR20 response rate at Week 24, in both PPS1 and FAS populations attesting the robustness of the 
outcome. The proportion of subjects in PPS1 population reaching the ACR20 response rate at week 24 
were 72.4% (173/239) and 72.2% (171/237) in the SB5 and EU Humira groups, respectively. The 
estimated difference in proportions was 0.1% and its 95% CI -7.83% - 8.13%, and was well contained 
within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ±15%. In FAS population the corresponding response 
rates were 68.0% (183/269) and 67.4% (184/273) leading to the adjusted difference in proportions of 
0.8% and 95% CI of -7.03 – 8.56%. Thus, regarding the primary outcome the study fulfilled the 
biosimilarity criteria. In addition, although the plateau in ACR20 response rate was reached at Week 24 
the earlier time course of ACR20 response did not reveal relevant differences either, thus confirming 
similarity also in the sensitive, steep part of the time/response curve. Also the secondary endpoints 
ACR50 and ACR70 were confined within the equivalence margin at week 24.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 65/111 
 
 
 
 
Longer-term secondary outcomes ACR20 and ACR50 at Week 52 showed a trend of a modestly better 
response in the SB5 group compared to the EU Humira and also in the switched SB5/Humira group 
compared to the group of patients continuing with Humira. Thus, when evaluating ACR20 response at 
week 52, in the PPS1, the lower limits of the 95% CI of the adjusted treatment differences in ACR20 
response rate at Week 52 (-4.63%) between the SB5 and Humira /Humira treatment group was 
preserved within the exploratory equivalence margin of [-15%, 15%] pre-defined for Week 24, however 
not the upper limits (15.90%). This finding is not confirmed, when looking at the FAS [-8.34%,10.75%]. 
Since the study was not planned to show similarity at week 52 these measures are considered not 
indicative of a higher response rate of SB5, at week 52, especially, since ACR50 (−2.9% [95% CI: 
−14.46%, 8.69%]), ACR70 (0.3% [95% CI: −10.25%, 10.86%]), and DAS28 score (−0.10 [−0.38, 
0.18], margin: -0.6/0.6), once more show strong support of similarity in long term efficacy.  
The percentage of subjects who achieved a major clinical response, which is defined as ACR70 response 
for 6 consecutive months at Week 52 was 15.7% (39/248) in the SB5 and 9.7% (12/124) in the 
Humira/Humira treatment groups. This might indicate that major clinical response is more likely to occur 
under SB5 compared to Humira. In addition the difference vanishes in patients switched from Humira to 
SB5, where 15.3% (18/118) show major clinical response.  
To claim similar long-term efficacy between the products, the Applicant has looked at the components of 
ACR in different time points up to Week 52. In each ACR criteria the products had similar scores and at 
Week 52 no clear difference in any criteria was seen, supporting the biosimilarity regarding the primary 
outcome.  The trend of seemingly better ACR20 response and major clinical response at Week 52 in SB5 
treatment compared to the reference product treatment group was temporal, which fell into normal 
variability of the ACR response. Moreover, efficacy parameters other than ACR20 response rate and major 
clinical response were comparable across the treatment groups at Week 52.  
Altogether, the secondary outcomes encompassing also structural endpoint were in line with the primary 
efficacy analysis supporting the biosimilarity claim. Some modest differences between groups were 
observed in the secondary outcome analyses, but these being descriptive analyses not adequately 
powered they do not change the overall impression on biosimilarity. The Applicant has submitted the 
comparative statistical analysis of the individual ACR components, which indicates biosimilarity in each 
ACR component analysed. 
The difference in ACR20 response between the SB5 and EU Humira groups was seen in ADA-positive 
subgroup comparison. Instead, treatment responses were highly comparable between the SB5 and EU 
Humira treatment groups for the ADA-negative subgroup. If ADA positive groups are compared the 
ACR20 level was reached only by 57.5% (42/73) of the subjects in the SB5 group and 71.2% (52/73) of 
the subjects in the Humira group, which brings estimated difference in proportions of -17.5% (95% CI 
-33.3%, -1.8%) between the groups, while in ADA negative subjects the difference in proportions 
between the groups was 5.7% (95% CI -3.8%, 15.2%). However, in long-term efficacy no clear withering 
effect in ADA positive patients was seen, which would have been expected when more patients will turn 
out to be ADA positive with longer exposure time. Furthermore, clear fluctuation in ACR scores was seen 
and no correlation between worsening of the response and increasing number of NAb-positivity was seen. 
Moreover, the results between treatment groups in both ADA positive and negative subgroups were 
similar in DAS28 score. Thus, the observed difference does not exclude the biosimilarity claim between 
the products. Other subgroup analyses of baseline CRP, age, and demographic characteristics showed no 
interaction with treatment. 
Overall ANCOVA for ACR20 response at Week 24 by the ADA results (PPS1) resulted in statistically 
significant difference (p-value 0.015) between the groups. The efficacy difference in ADA positive groups 
was less in ACR50 (SB5 28.8%, Humira 35.6%); and pointing in the opposite direction for ACR 70 (SB5 
19.2%, Humira 16.4%). Based on the ACR response rate curve for the group continuing with Humira after 
Assessment report

Page 66/111 
 
 
 
 
week 24 and SB5 group, the ACR responses seem to be consistently lower in the SB5 ADA positive 
subgroup in each time-point evaluated. This observation, however, cannot be considered clinically 
important since the difference in the ACR20 responses was highest at week 24, but narrowed towards 
week 52, which is contradictory if the difference would be due to increased immunogenicity.  
In the ADA-positive subgroups, the Humira group had better efficacy as determined by AUC of ACR 
responses (categorical variables), whereas no difference was seen when DAS28 AUC (continuous 
variable) was used. Furthermore, the incidence of ADAs, titers and neutralizing capacity were comparable 
between the groups. Regarding the kinetics the exposure to adalimumab was similarly decreased in both 
ADA-positive groups. Thus, based on these data the increased ACR responses in ADA positive Humira 
group could be considered an isolated finding that is not compatible with ADA results, pharmacokinetics 
or the DAS28 results. In addition, any long-term withering of the efficacy outcome was not seen in overall 
population and even improved efficacy in a group who switched from Humira to SB5 was seen.  
The Applicant is claiming the same indications as granted for the originator Humira. Since the primary 
adalimumab mechanism of action is similar between rheumatoid, psoriasis and HS indications and the 
quality and pre-clinical data have shown comparable physicochemical and functional characteristics 
between the SB5 and Humira, extrapolation can be agreed in these indications granted for the originator. 
The comparative functional analyses performed included also the binding and effector functions of 
membrane bound TNF-α, demonstrating comparable bioanalytical behaviour between the SB5 and 
Humira, further on supporting the similar mechanistic functions of the products also in IBD indications. 
Regarding the uveitis indication recently granted for the Humira originator and applied by the Applicant 
the provided justification for extrapolation is sufficient for the claim of this indication. 
Since only the 40 mg/0.8 ml strength has been studied and the MA is only sought for that PFS 
presentation and the product is intended to be marketed as a fixed dose product without the graduation 
in the syringe the product is suitable only to those children for whom this dose level is applicable. The 
Applicant has amended the posology Section 4.2 of the SmPC to conform with the limitations in the 
paediatric use and included the advice to use other formulations and presentations of adalimumab 
products in the paediatric patients not suited for the current dose. According to the recent principle 
recommendation by the CHMP related to paediatric indications of biosimilar products, the Section 4.1 of 
the SmPC should include paediatric indications in full, as with the originator, and Section 4.2 should 
include explanatory details on which patients can be dosed with the existing presentation. The Applicant 
has updated the SmPC accordingly. 
The Applicant had performed improvement to the SB5 single-dose Safety PFS device based on the data 
obtained from three formative studies prior to human factors validation study. No device failures or 
use-related risks were observed in human factor study. The Applicant had provided the full study reports 
from the formative studies and the human factors validation study. Based on the documentation 
provided, the study and the performed improvements based on the formative study results seem 
adequate to support the safe use and usability of the device.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The applicant has submitted safety data on 189 healthy volunteers exposed to a single 40 mg s.c. dose of 
adalimumab and on 544 RA patients exposed to at least one dose of 40 mg every other week [EOW] via 
s.c. injection for up to 52 weeks: 
In the clinical Phase I study SB5-11-NHV, a total of 189 healthy subjects were randomised to receive a 
single dose of adalimumab (40 mg via s.c. injection), with 63 subjects in each of the three treatment 
groups (SB5, EU Humira and US Humira). The SAF comprised all subjects who received at least one dose 
of investigational product (IP). 
In the clinical Phase III study SB5-G31-RA, 544 patients were randomised to receive adalimumab (40 mg 
every other week [EOW] via s.c. injection) for up to 52 weeks. Safety Set 1 (SAF1) consisted of all 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of IP during the study. Safety Set 2 (SAF2) consisted of all SAF1 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of IP after re-randomisation at Week 24. 271 subjects were 
randomised to the SB5 treatment group and 273 subjects were randomised to the EU Humira treatment 
group. 254 (93.7%) subjects in the SB5 and 254 (93.0%) subjects in the EU Humira treatment groups 
completed 24 weeks of the study. Prior to Week 24, 36 (6.6%) subjects withdrew from the study, 
including 17 subjects (6.3%) from the SB5 treatment group and 19 (7.0%) subjects from the EU Humira 
treatment group.  
At Week 24, of the 254 subjects receiving EU Humira, 125 (49.2%) were randomised to transition to SB5 
40 mg (Humira/SB5) and 129 (50.8%) were randomised to continue on EU Humira In total, 248 (97.6%) 
subjects in the SB5, 117 (93.6%) subjects in the Humira/SB5, and 124 (96.1%) subjects in the 
Humira/Humira treatment group completed 52 weeks of the study. Between Week 24 and Week 52, 19 
(3.7%) subjects withdrew from the study; 6 (2.4%) subjects from the SB5 treatment group, 8 (6.4%) 
subjects from the Humira/SB5, and 5 (3.9%) subjects from the Humira/Humira treatment group.  40 mg 
(hereinafter Humira/Humira) 
Duration of exposure 
541 subjects included in the SAF1 received at least 1 injection of SB5 or EU Humira. Up to Week 24, the 
mean duration of exposure was 150.7 days in the SB5 treatment group and 148.7 days in the EU Humira 
treatment group. Up to Week 52, the duration of exposure to the IP was comparable between the SB5 and 
Humira overall treatment groups and between the SB5 and Humira/Humira treatment groups. The mean 
duration of exposure was 333.6 days in the SB5, 324.6 days in the Humira overall, 343.3 days in the 
Humira/SB5, and 348.3 days in the Humira/Humira treatment groups.

The safety end-points of this healthy volunteer-study included: 
•  Vital signs abnormalities (semi-supine position) 
•  Abnormalities in physical examination 
• 
• 
Incidence of abnormalities in clinical laboratory values 
including haematology, chemistry and urinalysis 
•  Abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) 
Injection site assessment 
There were no deaths or discontinuation due to TEAEs (treatment emergent adverse events) during the 
study. Among healthy volunteers, TEAEs were observed in 57.1%, 46.0% and 61.9% of subjects in the 
SB5 group, EU Humira and US Humira groups, respectively, most commonly nasopharyngitis (19.0% and 
12.7% in SB5 and Humira-groups, respectively) and headache (17.5% and 6.3%). 
Most AEs were mild or moderate, with only one severe event observed in the US Humira group.

• 
Incidence of SAEs 
Incidence of AEs (graded as mild, moderate and severe) 
Incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities 
•  Vital signs abnormalities 
•  AEs of special interest (AESI): Serious infections, Active tuberculosis 
AEs were assessed with regards to severity, causality, and expectedness. Protocol section 8.1.5. defines 
causality assessment as follows: “The causal relationship between the IP and the AE should be defined as 
not related (no) or related (yes). Events should be classified as “related” if there is a reasonable possibility 
that the IP caused the AE. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. Events should be classified as “not related” if there is not a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the AE.” 
A total of 207 (38.3%) subjects reported 457 TEAEs at any time after the first dose of IP until Week 24; 
96 (35.8%) subjects in the SB5 and 111 (40.7%) subjects in the Humira treatment groups reported 
TEAEs. The most common TEAE was nasopharyngitis (4.9% and 9.2% in the SB5 and Humira groups).

in the Humira/Humira  treatment groups.  A total of 17.2% of subjects experienced a TEAE judged as 
related to the IP, and 37.2% of subjects experienced a TEAE judged as not related to the IP by the 
investigator; there was no obvious difference between the SB5 and Humira groups. The most common 
TEAE was nasopharyngitis (9%, 12.6%). Upper respiratory tract infection was seen in 3.7% and 0.8% of 
patients in the SB5 and Humira/Humira groups.

There were 3 AESIs up to Week 24 in 3 subjects (0.6%) overall. In the SB5 treatment group, 1 (0.4%) 
subject was reported with 1 AESI: 
• A 51-year-old female white subject was reported with Escherichia urinary tract infection on Day 128, 
which was noted as resolved on Day 143. The event was moderate in severity, required hospitalisation 
and led to temporary discontinuation of IP. The event was considered to be related to the IP. 
In the Humira treatment group, 2 (0.7%) subjects were each reported with 1 AESI up to Week 24: 
• A 58-year-old female white subject was reported with bronchopneumonia on Day 24, which was noted 
as resolved on Day 52. The event was severe in severity, required hospitalisation and led to temporary 
discontinuation of IP. The event was considered to be related to the IP.

• A 63-year-old male white subject was reported with staphylococcal sepsis on Day 109, which was 
resolving. The event was severe in severity, and required hospitalisation. The event led to discontinuation 
of IP and was considered not to be related to the IP. 
Malignancies 
3 events in 2 subjects in the Humira treatment group were malignancies: 1 subject was reported with 
lymphoma and metastases to spine and 1 subject was reported with papillary thyroid cancer. There were 
no malignancies reported in the SB5 treatment group up to Week 24. 
Other Significant Adverse Events up to Week 52 for the Safety Set 1 
There were 5 AESIs up to Week 52 in 5 subjects (0.9%) overall. In the SB5 treatment group, 1 (0.4%) 
subject was reported with 1 AESI: 
• 1 subject was reported with Escherichia urinary tract infection. 
In the Humira overall treatment group, 4 (1.5%) subjects each reported 1 AESI: 
• 1 subject was reported with bronchopneumonia. 
• 1 subject was reported with staphylococcal sepsis. 
• A 58-year-old female white subject was reported with a urinary tract infection on Day 386, which was 
noted as resolved on Day 403. The last dose of IP had been given on Day 358. The event was severe 
in severity, and required hospitalisation. The event was considered not to be related to the IP. 
• A 21-year-old female white subject was reported with pneumonia on Day 245, which was noted as 
resolved on Day 256. The event was severe in severity, and required hospitalisation. The event led to 
temporary discontinuation of IP and was considered to be related to the IP. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies were reported in a total of 5 (0.9%) subjects up to Week 52; 1 malignancy was reported in 
1 (0.4%) subject in the SB5 treatment group, 5 malignancies in 4 (1.5%) subjects in the Humira overall 
treatment group, and 1 malignancy in 1 (0.8%) subject in the Humira/Humira treatment group. 
In the SB5 treatment group, 1 (0.4%) subject was reported with a malignancy: 
• A 52-year-old male white subject was reported with small cell lung cancer on Day 329, which was noted 
as resolving. The event was severe in severity, medically important, and required hospitalisation. The 
event was not considered to be related to the IP. 
In the Humira overall treatment group, 5 malignancies were reported in 4 (1.5%) subjects: 
• A 48-year-old female white subject was reported with papillary thyroid cancer on Day 62, which was 
noted as recovered with sequelae on Day 181. The event was mild in severity, medically important, 
and required hospitalisation. The event was not considered to be related to the IP. IP was permanently 
discontinued. 
• 1 subject was reported with lymphoma and metastases to spine. 
• 1 subject was reported with glioblastoma multiforme.

• A 45-year-old male white subject was reported with seminoma on Day 313, which was noted as resolved 
with sequelae on Day 314. The event was mild in severity and required hospitalisation. The event was 
not considered to be related to the IP. 
Newly occurred AEs after week 24 (SAF2) 
A total of 265 AEs were reported in 171 (33.8%) subjects; 82 (32.3%) subjects in the SB5/SB5 treatment 
group, 47 (37.6%) subjects in the Humira/SB5 treatment group and 42 (33.1%) subjects in the Humira 
/Humira treatment group reported any kind of AEs. For Humira /SB5 treatment group, if a lag time 
window overlapped with pre-transition IP (Humira) exposure time period (28 days), the AE was 
considered to be undetermined. Otherwise, the AE was considered to be attributed to post-transition IP 
(SB5). 
Table 2.6.5.  Number (%) of Subjects with TEAEs and Number of Events by PT Newly Occurred 
after Week 24 in ≥ 2% of Subjects in Any Treatment Group (SAF 2) 
The most common new AE after week 24 was nasopharyngitis (4.3 and 2.4% in SB5 and 
Humira/Humira-groups). The AEs seen in the undetermined group, i.e. immediately after the switch from 
EU-Humira to SB5 (if a lag time window overlapped with pre-transition IP/ Humira exposure time period 
(28 days), then the AE was considered to be undetermined), included e.g. upper respiratory tract 
infections, headache, spinal pain, and importantly 3 patients (2.4%) had Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
complex test positive and 1 had latent tuberculosis. The Applicant had provided detailed information on 
these patients and concluded that it is not related to switching from EU Humira to SB5

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Study SB5-11-NHV 
There were no deaths during the study. Two SAEs occurred in 2 subjects; 1 subject from the SB5 
treatment group suffered from a psychotic disorder on day 21 day after administration of the IP and was 
hospitalized, and 1 subject from the US sourced Humira treatment group who developed appendicitis on 
15 day after administration of the IP and underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy; both events were 
assessed by the Investigator not to be related to the IP. 
Study SB5-G31-RA 
Deaths 
There were 2 deaths reported during the study from the Humira treatment group: 
- 60-year-old female white subject in the Humira treatment group was reported with cardiac arrest on 
Day 137 (or Week 20). The last IP administration prior to death was on Day 128. On study Day 125, the 
subject had been hospitalised with paraplegia. After the diagnostic procedures (tumour assessment 
results were unavailable), the subject was diagnosed with serious adverse events (SAEs) of lymphoma 
and metastases to spine. On study Day 137, the subject experienced a fatal adverse event of cardiac 
arrest. Autopsy was not performed. The Investigator considered the event of lymphoma and metastases 
to spine to be related to IP and the event of cardiac arrest to be unrelated to IP.  
-63-year-old male white subject in the Humira treatment group was reported with pulmonary embolism 
on Day 126 (or Week 18). The last IP administration prior to death was on Day 111. On study day 108, the 
subject had experienced an SAE of vascular pseudoaneurysm, and undergone surgery (distal prosthetic 
anastomosis of right limb), and was diagnosed with Staphylococcal sepsis and treatetd with antibiotics 
and lower leg incisions on both sides. Due to long immobilization and infection, on study day 126, the 
subject experienced pulmonary embolism with fatal outcome. Autopsy was not performed. The 
Investigator considered the events of vascular pseudoaneurysm, Staphylococcal sepsis and pulmonary 
embolism to be unrelated to IP. 
A total of 15 SAEs were reported in 11 (2.0%) of the subjects; 3 (1.1%) subjects reported 3 SAEs in the 
SB5 treatment group, and 8 (2.9%) subjects reported 12 SAEs in the EU Humira treatment group. 
Of the 15 SAEs reported, 2 from the Humira treatment group were fatal and 2 in the neoplasm benign, 
malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) SOC from the Humira treatment group only were 
not resolved (mediastinal lymph nodes tumor and metastatic spinal tumor).

N = number of subjects in the Safety Set 1; n = number of subjects with SAEs 
E = frequency of the AEs started before Week 24; SAE = serious adverse event 
Adverse  events  were  coded  by  system  organ  class  and  preferred  term  using  the  MedDRA  Version 
17.0 coding dictionary. 
Percentages were based on the number of subjects in the Safety Set 1. 
Up to week 52, total of 29 SAEs were reported in 25 (4.6%) subjects; 9 (3.4%) subjects reported 9 SAEs 
in the SB5, 16 (5.9%) subjects reported 20 SAEs in the Humira overall, and 6 (4.7%) subjects reported 
6 SAEs in the Humira/Humira treatment groups. Of the 29 SAEs reported, 2 were fatal (see above).  Of 
the 9 SAEs reported in the SB5 treatment group up to Week 52, 2 SAEs were considered to be related to 
the IP. Of the 20 SAEs reported in the Humira overall treatment group up to Week 52, 5 SAEs were 
considered to be related to the IP.

Laboratory findings 
Study SB5-G11-NHV 
Among healthy volunteers, the mean and median values of all parameters of haematology, biochemistry 
and urinalysis did not show any changes over time. Minor alterations were comparable to those usually 
seen in a healthy population. There were no clinically meaningful post-dose changes in these parameters 
from baseline after SB5, EU Humira or US Humira administrations. 
Study SB5-G31-RA 
The values and changes from baseline for each laboratory parameter for haematology, biochemistry 
(including rheumatoid factor and CRP), and urinalysis were comparable between the SB5 and Humira 
overall treatment groups and between the SB5 and Humira /Humira treatment groups (SAF1). 
Up to Week 24, the most commonly reported significant abnormal haematology parameter was low 
neutrophils, reported in 4 (1.5%) subjects in the SB5 and 4 (1.5%) subjects in the EU Humira treatment 
groups. Low lymphocytes were reported in 3 (1.1%) vs. 1 (0.4%) subject, and high neutrophils was 
reported in 3 (1.1%) vs. 0 subjects, respectively.  
The number of subjects with at least 1 post-dose significant abnormality in any of the haematology 
parameters up to Week 52 for the SAF1 are summarised in table below. 
The only difference between the groups was in the number of patients with high neutrophil accounts, i.e. 
4 patients in SB5 and none in Humira-group.

Up to Week 24, the most commonly reported significant abnormal biochemistry parameter was high ALT, 
reported in the 8 (3.0%) subjects in the SB5 treatment group and 13 (4.8%) subjects in the EU Humira 
treatment group. High AST was reported in 4 (1.5%) vs. 5 (1.8%) subjects, and high γGT was reported 
in 2 (0.7%) vs. 3 (1.1%) subjects, respectively. 
The number of subjects with at least 1 post-dose significant abnormality in any of the biochemistry 
parameters for the SAF1 up to Week 52 are summarised in the table below.

Auto-antibodies 
Anti-nuclear Antibodies 
At Baseline, the majority of subjects in the SB5 and EU Humira treatment groups had negative 
anti-nuclear antibody (ANA): 254 (95.1%) and 258 (94.9%), respectively. 
At Week 24, 5 (1.9%) subjects in the SB5 and 3 (1.2%) subjects in the EU Humira treatment groups had 
a shift from positive ANA at baseline to negative. Shifts from negative ANA at baseline to positive at Week 
24 were reported in 12 (4.6%) subjects and 13 (5.0%) subjects, respectively. At Week 52, shifts from 
positive ANA at baseline to negative were reported in 2 (0.8%) subjects in the SB5, 3 (1.2%) subjects in 
the Humira overall, 1 (0.8%) subjects in the Humira/SB5, and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the Humira/Humira 
treatment groups. Shifts from negative ANA at baseline to positive at Week 52 were reported in 21 
(8.4%) vs. 25 (10.0%) vs. 14 (11.4%) vs. 11 (8.8%), respectively.

Anti-double Stranded DNA Antibodies 
At Week 24, a total of 3 and 5 subjects in the SB5 and EU Humira treatment groups, respectively, tested 
positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies. At Week 52, 6 subjects in the SB5, 2 in the Humira overall, 1 in the 
Humira/SB5, and 1 in the Humira/Humira treatment groups tested positive. None of the subjects who 
were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies developed a lupus-like syndrome. 
Urinalysis 
There were no notable differences in the proportion of subjects with abnormal (not clinically significant or 
clinically significant) urinalysis parameters (erythrocytes, glucose, haemoglobin, ketones, leukocytes, 
nitrite, protein, and urobilinogen) up to Week 52 observed between the SB5 and Humira overall treatment 
groups, and between the SB5 and the Humira/Humira treatment groups. 
No meaningful differences were observed for laboratory evaluations in the different treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
The Applicant has not conducted specific studies on assessing the potential impact of intrinsic factors on 
safety of SB5, and relies on the documentation of the reference product Humira. 
Immunological events 
Anti-adalimumab antibody assay methodology 
Anti-Drug-Antibodies (ADAs) were measured by a bridging ligand-binding electro-chemiluminescent 
(ECL) assayin both Humira- and SB5-treated patients. (For validation of these methods, see Analytical 
methods in the Discussion on Clinical pharmacology section of this AR and Clinical AR.) 
Neutralising antibodies 
Neutralising antibodies (Nabs) were measured. The  neutralising activity was assessed by inhibition of 
TNF-α binding to immobilised SB5 by circulating ADAs. 
Antigenicity of SB5 and Humira 
The Applicant claims that adalimumab of EU-Humira and SB5 are antigenically equivalent by showing a 
similar inhibition of the signal by a monoclonal human anti-adalimumab antibody. In addition, the 
Applicant has used dilution curves of polyclonal rabbit anti-SB5 and rabbit anti-adalimumab (from EU 
Humira) to demonstrate similar reactivity in the ECL assay. 
ADAs in clinical samples from healthy individuals and patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis 
Immunogenicity was studied in both clinical studies. The single dose study in healthy volunteers (Study 
SB5-G11-NHV) is part of a global development program and compared the PK profiles of SB5 with Humira 
sourced either from the EU or the USA. The confirmatory efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study 
SB5-G31-RA included also a pharmacokinetic sub-study.

Study SB5-G11-NHV 
Study “A Randomised, Single-blind, Three-arm, Parallel Group, Single-dose Study to Compare the 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Three Formulations of adalimumab (SB5, 
EU Humira  and US Humira ) in Healthy Subjects”  involved 189 subjects (63 per arm) who were 
randomized into the three study arms, all of whom were included in the safety analysis. After 
administration of a single subcutaneous 40mg adalimumab dose, the pharmacokinetic profile was similar 
between SB5, EU-Humira and US-Humira. The PK results do not suggest any significant bias in the 
analysis of immunogenicity in terms of drug tolerance. 
ADA- and Nab-positivity was defined as at least one post-dose positive sample. The post-dose incidence 
of ADAs was 62/63 (98.4%), 60/63 (95.2%), and 63/63 (100%) in subjects administered with SB5, EU 
Humira, and US Humira, respectively. The frequency of positive samples was comparable in the groups at 
all sampling points (Table below).  
Table 2.6.11. Summary of study SB5-G11-NHV Immunogenicity Results 
The titers were comparable in the groups (see figure below).

  Nabs were detected in 49/62 (79.0%), 48/60 (80.0%), and 52/63 (82.5%) of subjects in the SB5, 
EU-Humira, and US-Humira groups, respectively. The incidence was comparable in all groups at all 
sampling points. 
Study SB5-G31-RA 
The confirmatory Study SB5-G31-RA,  “A Randomised, Double-blind, Parallel Group, Multicentre Clinical 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity of SB5 Compared to 
Humira  in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis despite Methotrexate Therapy” 
involved a total of 544 RA patients, 271 subjects to the SB5 treatment group and 273 to the EU-Humira  
treatment group. Blood samples for the determination of ADAs and NAbs were collected at baseline and 
Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52.  
ADAs were found in 32% and 31% of patients treated with SB5 and EU-Humira, respectively, by week 24. 
At week 52, the numbers among SB5-treated and Humira-treated patients were 36% and 37%, 
respectively (see table below).

Immunogenicity after the switch in study SB5-G31-RA 
At Week 24, 254 subjects receiving Humira  were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either continuing on 
Humira 40 mg (Humira/Humira , n=129) or to switching to SB5 (Humira/SB5, n=125) up to Week 50. The 
254 subjects initially randomized to SB5 continued to receiving SB5 40 mg up to Week 50. 
Five (6.3%) subjects in the Humira/SB5 and 11 (12.6%) subjects in the Humira/Humira treatment 
groups converted to ADA-positive after Week 24. 
Among the 45 subjects in the Humira/SB5 treatment group with an overall ADA positive result at Week 
24, 16 subjects (35.6%) had transitioned-treatment-boosted ADA (ADA titer was increased at any time 
after Week 24 compared with the highest ADA titer up to Week 24), 22 subjects (48.9%) had positive 
ADAs after Week 24 where the titer was the same or decreased from the highest titer from Week 0 to 
Week 24, and 7 subjects (15.6%) had ADA negative results at all visits after Week 24. 
Among 39 subjects in the Humira/Humira  treatment group with an overall ADA positive result at Week 24 
or an ADA positive or missing result at Week 0 (there was 1 subject with a missing result in this treatment 
group), 12 subjects (30.8%) had transitioned-treatment-boosted ADA, 23 subjects (59.0%) had positive 
ADAs after Week 24 where the titer was the same or decreased from the highest titer between Week 0 
and Week 24, and 4 subjects (10.3%) had ADA negative results at all visits after Week 24. 
Pre-existing antibodies (study SB5-G31-RA) 
Among the 20 subjects in the SB5 treatment group with an ADA positive or missing result at Week 0, 9 
subjects (45.0%) had treatment-boosted ADA (ADA titer was increased at any time post-baseline 
compared with the baseline titer), 9 subjects (45.0%) had positive ADAs where the titer was the same or 
decreased compared with the baseline titer at any time after onset of SB5 administration, and 2 subjects 
(10.0%) had ADA negative results at all visits after IP administration. 
Among 9 subjects in the Humira treatment group with an ADA positive or missing result at Week 0, 5 
subjects (55.6%) had treatment-boosted ADA (including a subject who had a missing value at baseline 
and positive results post-baseline), 1 subject (11.1%) had positive ADAs where the titer was the same or 
decreased compared with the baseline titer at any time after IP administration, and 3 subjects (33.3%) 
had ADA negative results at all visits after IP administration. 
Impact of ADAs on the pharmacokinetics of adalimumab 
In the single-dose pharmacokinetic study in healthy individuals (SB5-G11-NHV), the number of 
ADA-negative individuals was too low for comparisons. Therefore, the Applicant divided the subjects to 
low, medium, and high titer groups. The AUCinf and AUClast had an inverse correlation to the titers of 
ADAs. High titer ADA-positive patients had higher adalimumab clearance rates. The impact of high titer 
ADAs was also seen on Cmax. The effect appeared similar in SB5-, EU-Humira, and US-Humira subgroups 
(see Table and Figure below for example).

PK parameters did not differ between SB5-, EU-Humira-, and US-Humira-treated patients when 
ADA-positive and –negative patients were analysed separately (see Figure below). 
Figure 2.6.3 Comparison of AUCinf Mean (SD) across ADA Titer Subgroups (Study 
SB5-G11-NHV) 
The confirmatory Study SB5-G31-RA, there were a total of 544 RA patients, 271 subjects to the SB5 
treatment group and 273 to the EU-Humira treatment group. Pre-dose trough concentrations were 
measured in 178 patients both in the SB5- and EU-Humira groups, respectively. Fifty-five patients were 
ADA-positive in the PK-groups of both treatment arms. At week 52, the numbers among SB5-treated and 
Humira-treated patients were 36% and 39%, respectively. 
The trough (pre-dose) levels were comparable in the SB5- and EU-Humira treated patients in both ADA- 
and ADA+ patient populations. In general, trough concentrations were lower in ADA+ population (see 
Figure below).

The ACR20 response at week 24 in ADA positive patients showed a slight drop in subjects treated with 
SB5 compared to Humira. When comparing mean Ctrough levels at week 24 in the ADA positive subgroup 
(51/178 subjects treated with SB5 as well as with Humira), however, mean Ctrough levels were slightly 
higher with SB5 compared to Humira (2.95 µg/ml vs. 2.86 µg/ml). Thus, no correlation between the 
observed temporary decline in ACR20 at week 24 and PK (mean Ctrough level) is seen, although it is noticed 
that Ctrough levels were only taken in a subset of patients. The mean through concentrations did not 
change significantly in the steady state until week 24. 
Impact of ADAs on efficacy 
At week 24, the percentages of ACR20-responses were comparable in ADA-negative SB5- and 
EU-Humira-treated patients. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the ADA-positive 
population; 57.5% in the SB5 treated patients and 71.2% in EU-Humira-treated patients. A similar trend 
was also found in ACR50 and ACR70 responses but the differences were not statistically significant. (See 
Table 3.4.5.12) 
The ACR20 response rate in ADA-positive patients was 68.5% at Week 16, 57.5% at Week 24, 69.9% at 
Week 32, 68.6% at Week 40, and 68.6% at Week 52, for the SB5 treatment group, compared to 58.9% 
at Week 16, 71.2% at Week 24, 76.7% at Week, 66.2% at Week 40 and 78.9% at Week 52 for the Humira 
overall treatment group (Figure below). 
Figure 2.6.5.   ACR20 Response up to Week 52 by Overall ADA Status up to Week 24 and

The ACR50 response rate in ADA-positive patients was 34.2% at Week 16, 28.8% at Week 24, 32.9% at 
Week 32, 41.4% at Week 40 and 42.9% at Week 52 for the SB5 treatment group, compared to 35.6% at 
Week 16, 35.6% at Week 24, 42.5% at Week 32, 40.8% at Week 40 and 52.1% at Week 52 for the

Figure 3.4.8.6 ACR50 Response up to Week 52 by Overall ADA Status up to Week 24 and 
Treatment Group (Per-Protocol Set 1) (Study SB5-G31-RA) 
At week 52, the difference between ADA-positive SB5-treated patients was not seen in ACR70 responses. 
The finding that ACR responses were lower in ADA-positive patients at week 24 in SB5 compared to 
Humira group is unexpected. In Weeks 1-24, the AUC of ACR20 was 10% higher in the Humira group 
whereas the AUC DAS28 was similar. ACR responses of SB5-treated patients in the whole (per protocol) 
population were within the pre-specified equivalence range. The difference between the ADA-positive 
groups is not widening towards week 52. The ADA-positive subgroups are small and vulnerable for 
fluctuation. It seems obvious that the ACR20-difference between the ADA-positive groups is a chance 
finding since a difference is not seen in the ADA-prevalence, exposure or DAS28 results. In fact, the 
behavior of both ADA-positive groups is unexpected with regard to ARC20 responses. The ADA-positive 
SB5 group had an unexpected drop in the ACR responses at week 24 whereas the ADA-positive Humira 
group had almost the same ACR responses as the ADA-negative group. This contradicts previous data on 
adalimumab.  
The incidence, titers and neutralizing capacity of ADAs seem comparable between the groups. 
Interestingly, there was no significant difference in ACR20 responses in patients with neutralizing 
antibodies. Thus, there is no evidence of an increased immunogenicity of SB5. 
ADAs are known to reduce the exposure and efficacy of adalimumab. ADA-positive patients in both SB5 
and adalimumab treatment groups had lower trough concentrations than the ADA-negative patients but 
there were no difference between ADA-positive groups. The Applicant divided the patients into two groups 
on the basis of the trough level (above and below1.274 µg/mL) that has been shown to distinguish 
patients with good and poor response to adalimumab. In both groups, a better response was seen in the 
high trough level group by all efficacy endpoints, except in the ACR20 response in the Humira group 
(where the response was similar in those with above and below 1.274 µg/mL threshold; this is unusual 
finding, as discussed above). Taken together, data on DAS28, exposure, and ADAs as well historical data 
on efficacy and exposure in ADA-positive patients suggest that the difference in the ACR responses 
between the ADA-positive groups is most likely a chance finding.

Injection site reactions:  
Among healthy volunteers, only one injection site reaction occurred classified according to applicant´s 
scaling system (scale 0-15, score of ≥  2 classified as an AE).  
In study SB5-G31-RA, up to Week 24, injection site reactions (3.0% in the SB5 vs. 2.9% in the EU Humira 
treatment group) were comparable between the SB5 and EU Humira treatment groups. Up to Week 52, 
the proportions of subjects who experienced injection site reactions for the SAF1 were comparable 
between the SB5 and Humira overall treatment groups and between the SB5 and Humira/Humira 
treatment groups. The number of reactions was higher in the Humira overall and Humira/Humira 
treatment groups, due to high numbers of events of ‘injection site reaction’ and ‘injection site erythema’. 
In the SB5 treatment group, 8 (3.0%) subjects reported 9 injection site reactions, in the Humira overall 
treatment group, 8 (2.9%) subjects reported 45 injection site reactions, and in the Humira/Humira 
treatment group, 4 (3.1%) subjects reported 32 injection site reactions when the high-level group term 
of administration site reaction was regarded as injection site reaction. 
For the Safety Set 2 (after Week 24), Injection site reactions after Week 24 were reported in 2 (1.6%) 
subjects in the Humira/Humira treatment group only in the SAF2. 
Two subjects discontinued the study due to hypersensitivity reactions (PT allergic dermatitis), both in 
Humira group. 
Incidence of Injection Site Reactions by ADA Status 
The overall incidence of injection site reactions (i.e., TEAEs with ‘administration site reactions’ as the high 
level group term) was 2.4% in the SB5 vs. 3.9% in the Humira treatment group in subjects with an overall 
negative ADA result up to Week 24 and 5.1% vs. 0.0%, in subjects with an overall positive ADA result up 
to Week 24. 
The overall incidence of injection site reactions was 2.5% in the SB5 vs. 4.3% in the Humira overall vs. 
3.9% in the Humira/Humira treatment groups among subjects with an overall negative ADA result up to 
Week 52 and 4.5% vs. 0.0% vs. 0.0%, respectively, among subjects with an overall positive ADA result 
up to Week 52. 
For both the overall ADA results up to Week 24 and Week 52, within the SB5 treatment group, there was 
a higher incidence of injection site reactions in subjects with an overall positive ADA result. However, 
within the Humira overall and Humira/Humira treatment groups, there was a higher incidence of injection 
site reactions in subjects with an overall negative ADA result. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The Applicant has not conducted further specific studies on the potential impact of drug interactions with 
SB5. This is in line with EMA guideline for biosimilar products 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Study SB5-G11-NHV 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs in Study SB5-G11-NHV. 
Study SB5-G31-RA 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs was 2.0% during the first 24 weeks, and 1.4% during weeks 
24-52 (see Table “Subject disposition). At week 24 0.7% and 3.3% of patients had discontinued due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 89/111 
 
 
 
 
AEs in the SB5 and Humira groups. At week 52 there were 26 events that had led to discontinuation of IP; 
8 events in 4 (1.5%) subjects in the SB5 treatment group, 18 events in 15 (5.5%) subjects in the Humira 
overall treatment group, and 3 events in 3 (2.4%) subjects in the Humira /Humira treatment group.  
TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation at the SOC level most commonly reported were skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (0 events in the SB5 vs. 4 events in 4 [1.5%] subjects in the Humira 
treatment groups), nervous system disorders (1 event in 1 [0.4%] subject vs. 2 events in 1 [0.4%] 
subject, respectively), and neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (0 
events vs. 3 events in 2 [0.7%] subjects, respectively). At the PT level, the TEAEs leading to IP 
discontinuation reported in ≥ 2 subjects were headache (1 event in 1 [0.4%] subject each in the SB5 and 
Humira treatment groups) and dermatitis allergic (0 events in the SB5 vs. 2 events in 2 [0.7%] subjects 
in the Humira treatment groups). 
In the SB5 treatment group, all 6 TEAEs reported which led to discontinuation of IP up to Week 24 were 
considered to be related to the IP: 
• A 65-year-old female white subject was reported with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
musculoskeletal pain, and headache on Day 57, which all resolved on Day 63. 
• A 53-year-old female white subject was reported with injection site urticaria on Day 16, which was not 
resolved. 
In the Humira treatment group, 10 of the 13 TEAEs leading to discontinuation of IP before Week 24 were 
considered to be related to the IP: 
• A 55-year-old male white subject was reported with rash on Day 142, which was not resolved. 
• A 58-year-old female white subject was reported with dermatitis allergic on Day 8, which was resolving. 
• A 50-year-old female white subject was reported with dermatitis allergic on Day 72, which was not 
resolved. 
• A 48-year-old male white subject was reported with drug hypersensitivity on Day 12, which resolved on 
Day 17. 
• A 60-year-old female white subject was reported with lymphoma and metastases to spine on Day 125, 
which were not resolved. 
• A 32-year-old female white subject was reported with dizziness, headache, and hypertension on Day 32, 
which were resolved (headache and hypertension on Day 56 and dizziness on Day 58). 
• A 51-year-old female white subject was reported with injection site reaction on Day 27, which resolved 
on Day 33. 
3 events leading to discontinuation of IP in 3 subjects in the Humira treatment group were considered not 
related to the IP: staphylococcal sepsis, papillary thyroid cancer and dermatitis. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The number of subjects (altogether 189 healthy volunteers out of which 63 were administered SB5; and 
544 RA-patients out of which 271 were administered SB5) is sufficient for comparing the safety profile of 
the biosimilar candidate SB5 and reference medicinal product EU-Humira and studying the safety of a 
biosimilar product for up to one year, in line with the EMA guideline to establish immunogenicity of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 90/111 
 
 
 
 
 
biosimilar product and in line with the given scientific advice. No information is available on exposure >12 
months.    
A pooled safety analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of study populations (RA patients 
versus healthy subjects) and the difference in duration of treatment/exposure (multiple-dose versus 
single-dose), which is acceptable. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs observed in SB5 group are in line with the known safety profile for 
Humira.  
Among healthy volunteers, TEAEs were observed in 57.1%, 46.0% and 61.9%  of subjects in the SB5 
group,  EU Humira and US Humira groups, respectively, most commonly nasopharyngitis (19% and 
12.7% in SB5 and EU-Humira groups) and headache (17.5 and 6.3%). No obvious signal of safety 
differences between SB5 and Humira was observed in the healthy volunteers; the difference in headache 
is considered a chance finding, as the same is not seen in the RA-study. 
In RA patients, a total of 207 (38.3%) subjects reported 457 TEAEs at any time after the first dose of IP 
until Week 24; 96 (35.8%) subjects in the SB5 and 111 (40.7%) subjects in the Humira treatment groups 
reported TEAEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs (e.g. nasopharyngitis 4.9% and 9.2%; headache 
3.4% and 2.6% in SB5 and Humira-groups) are in line with the know safety profile for Humira, and no 
obvious signal for safety differences between SB5 and Humira was observed. There were 5 AESIs 
reported during the study (1 in SB5-group, 0 in Humira/Humira-group, 4 in the overall Humira group), all 
were infections. The results up to week 52 were broadly similar, although there were slightly more upper 
respiratory tract infections in the SB5 group (3.7%) compared to Humira/Humira-group (0.8%), but this 
is considered a chance finding (in some other respiratory tract infection AE-groups the figures were on the 
opposite direction). 
The most common new AE after week 24 was nasopharyngitis (4.3 and 2.4% in SB5 and 
Humira/Humira-groups). The AEs seen in the undetermined group, i.e. immediately after the switch from 
EU-Humira to SB5 (if a lag time window overlapped with pre-transition IP/ Humira exposure time period 
(28 days), then the AE was considered to be undetermined), included e.g. upper respiratory tract 
infections, headache, spinal pain. In addition, importantly, 3 patients (2.4%) had Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis complex test positive and 1 had latent tuberculosis. However, it was clarified that 
tuberculosis test was actually performed prior to IP administration at Week 24 visit, and categorized as 
“undetermined” due to a time discrepancy between laboratory testing and reporting of AE.  
The Applicant was asked to clarify the guidance given to investigators with regards to causality 
assessment as the majority of AEs were classified as “not related” to the IP. However, it is concluded that 
the way causality was determined was not likely to cause bias between the treatment groups and to affect 
reliability of the study results with regards to safety. Furthermore, while of importance, the causality 
assessment is still considered secondary to detection and accurate documentation of TEAEs as a whole 
regardless of causality.  
A total of 11 TEAEs “rheumatoid arthritis” occurred in SAF1 and SAF2. It was confirmed that 11 cases 
represent worsening/exacerbation of pre-existing RA.  
There were two SAEs among the healthy volunteers, 1 in the SB5 and 1 in the Humira-group, both judged 
as not related to the IP by the investigator.  
In RA patients, the overall occurrence of SAEs was 2.0% during the first 24 weeks, and 2.4% during 
weeks 24-52. Two deaths occurred (both in Humira group, one case of cardiac arrest at week 20 and one 
case of pulmonary embolism at week 18) among RA patients, both events were judged as not related to 
the IP by the investigator (however, the case of cardiac arrest was preceded with the event of lymphoma 
and metastases to spine, judged as related to the IP). The overall occurrence of SAEs was low and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 91/111 
 
 
 
 
SAEs reported are in line with the known safety profile of adalimumab, with no obvious differences 
between the SB5 and Humira-groups. 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs in the healthy volunteer-Study SB5-G11-NHV. In RA-patients 
the rate of discontinuations due to AEs was low (0.7% SB5, 3.3% Humira at 24 weeks; 1.5% and 2.4% 
at 52 weeks). The AEs leading to discontinuation were in line with the known safety profile for 
adalimumab and thus with no major differences between the SB5 and Humira groups. 
Among healthy volunteers, the mean and median values of all parameters of haematology, biochemistry 
and urinalysis did not show any changes over time. In RA patients, the changes in hematologic and 
biochemical parameters were comparable between treatment groups, and in line with the known safety 
profile for adalimumab. The only difference between the groups was in the number of patients with high 
neutrophil accounts, i.e. 4 patients in SB5 and none in Humira-group; however, the numbers are small 
and this is a known ADR of adalimumab –thus this is considered a chance finding. 
The Applicant has not conducted specific studies on assessing the potential impact of intrinsic factors on 
safety of SB5, and relies on the documentation of the reference product Humira. This is considered 
acceptable as reference can be made to the innovator product regarding safety in special populations. 
With regard to immunogenicity, discussed here with an integrated holistic approach (See also under 
Clinical efficacy and Clinical pharmacology), in the single dose study in healthy volunteers, almost all 
patients were ADA-positive. The distribution of low, medium and high ADA titers was similar in SB5- and 
EU-Humira-treated patients. Most ADA-positive patients had NAbs in both treatment arms suggesting 
that ADAs are mainly anti-idiotypic. In the confirmatory equivalence study SB5-G31-RA, the incidences of 
ADAs were 32% and 31% in the SB5- and EU-Humira arms, respectively. According to the Applicant, the 
lower ADA-incidence in RA patients as compared to healthy individuals may be explained by the lower 
sensitivity of the RA-adapted ADA assay. Approximately half of the ADA-positive sera were positive in the 
NAb-assay. The titers of the ADA at different time points appeared similar in the treatment arms and 
increased over time. There was no indication that the switch from Humira to SB5 induced excess 
immunogenicity. This is in line with previous switch studies of biosimilars and their reference products. 
In healthy volunteers, exposure decreased by increasing ADA titers in both SB5- and EU-Humira groups. 
The exposure was similar between groups in ADA-positive and -negative groups. In RA patients who were 
ADA-positive, the trough levels were reduced, but in a comparable manner in both treatment groups. The 
ACR responses were comparable in the ADA-negative population. In ADA-positive population, there was 
a trend for a lower ACR20 and -50 response rates in ADA-positive population until week 52 as compared 
to the ADA-negative population (see under Clinical efficacy).  
Overall, the safety profiles of ADA-positive SB5 and Humira-treated patients were comparable. In RA 
patients, approximately 3% of subjects in both treatment groups experienced injection site reactions 
during the first 24 weeks, and the occurrence decreased thereafter. However, the number of reactions 
was higher in the Humira treated patients, compared to SB5 treated patients (up to week 52, 9 reactions 
in 8 subjects (3.0%) in SB5 group vs 32 reactions in 4 subjects (3.1%) in Humira/Humira group). Thus, 
there was an imbalance between the treatment groups in the number of injection site reactions, although 
the proportion of patients with injection site reactions seemed comparable. The Applicant explained that 
the difference in number of ISRs was mainly derived from 4 patients reporting repeated ISRs –in 
particular 2 patients reporting 12 and 13 events, respectively- thereby contributing to the imbalance in 
terms of higher number of ISRs in the Humira arm.  
Further, in ADA negative subjects, the incidence of injection site reactions was higher for the Humira 
treatment group while in ADA positive subjects a higher incidence for SB5 treatment was noticeable. The 
Applicant was asked to comment on the higher incidence of injection site reactions in the SB5 vs the 
Humira group for subjects with ADA. The response by the Applicant clarified that 2 of the 4 local AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 92/111 
 
 
 
 
observed in ADA positive SB5 subjects were injection site reactions that can be caused by any intravenous 
administration of a medicinal product (i.e. injection site haematoma and phlebitis), and that the incidence 
of 2 local AEs in the SB5 group vs. zero in the Humira group was most likely a chance finding. 
The scaling system for injection site reactions used in Study SB5-11-NHV, was not employed in study 
SB5-G31-RA. The reason why the scoring system was not employed in study SB5-G31-RA was that a 
detailed scoring system would not have been feasible in a phase III setting with 51 centres where 
injections are self-administered at home. However, a simplified, yet more systematic approach to guide 
investigators in the evaluation of ISRs could have been used to capture ISRs in the phase III setting, to 
decrease potential variability of assessment of ISRs as AEs by individual investigators/centres.   
In addition, the Applicant was asked to provide a table comparing the incidence of all TEAEs related to 
hypersensitivity reactions for the SAF1 and SAF2 overall and with regard to ADA status according to the 
MedDRA SMQ ‘Anaphylactic reaction’  Incidences were low both in ADA positive as well as ADA negative 
patients. No striking differences could be observed for SB5 and Humira treated patients. Similarly, after 
transition from SB5 to Humira no increased incidence of ADAs was seen. 
Finally, the Applicant analysed the sera for antinuclear and double-stranded DNA-antibodies. There were 
a few positive samples in both treatment arms. The autoantibodies were not associated with signs or 
symptoms suggesting systemic lupus erythematosus. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The number of subjects is sufficient for comparing the safety profile of the biosimilar candidate SB5 and 
reference medicinal product EU-Humira and studying the safety of a biosimilar product for up to one year. 
Broadly,  the  number,  severity  and  type  of  TEAEs,  SAEs,  AEs  of  special  interest,  treatment 
discontinuations due to AEs, laboratory findings were comparable between SB5 and Humira and mirroring 
the safety profile as described in the SmPC of Humira. The frequency of related AEs, severity of AEs and 
AESIs remained similar for the group who transitioned from Humira to SB5 at week 24. More detailed data 
on injection site reactions, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions were requested in order to allow a 
thorough assessment of this issue both in subjects with and without ADAs.  The submitted additional 
analyses further support the comparability of the safety profile of SB5 and Humira. 
With regard to immunogenicity, the incidence and titre distribution of ADAs were compared and seemed 
similar for SB5 and Humira, with about half of all subjects developing neutralising antibodies in each 
treatment group. No worsening of the immunogenicity profile was observed after transitioning from 
Humira to SB5.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
SB5 has been developed by Samsung Bioepis as a similar biological medicinal product to Humira. This 
marketing authorisation application (MAA) is therefore an abridged application submitted under the legal 
basis of Article 10 (4) of the Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. 
It is noteworthy that SB5 is currently only available as a single dose 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) 
presentation, as thus not all paediatric patients can be dosed with SB5 (this is reflected in the SmPC 
Section 4.2).  
Clinical studies to demonstrate similarity of SB5 to EU sourced Humira were presented in healthy 
volunteers (PK, safety and tolerability), as well as in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, PK). In addition the applicant presented a sophisticated discussion on the extrapolation of the 
different indications, justified by thorough physicochemical and structural analyses as well as by in vitro 
functional tests complemented with clinical data (efficacy and safety and/or PK/PD data) in RA patients 
and a thorough literature review of the mechanism of action (MoA) of adalimumab to justify extrapolation 
efficacy and safety data across all its approved therapeutic indications. This extrapolation is in agreement 
with the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017

active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1) as well as 
former CHMP Scientific Advice. The Applicant is also claiming the recently approved indications of Humira, 
namely hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis to harmonize labelling with the originator EU Humira.  Based 
on the product mode of action and target molecules the biosimilarity claim can be extrapolated to these 
conditions. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
This is a biosimilar application to Humira. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
SB5-G11-NHV 
Phase I study: A randomized, single-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single dose study in 189 healthy 
volunteers (63/arm) to demonstrate comparative PK, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
In each group, all subjects received a single dose (40 mg) of SB5, EU-sourced Humira, or US-sourced 
Humira by s.c. administration route. The primary PK endpoints were AUCinf and Cmax and the 
equivalence criteria were met if 90% CI for the ratio of geometric LS Means of SB5 to EU-sourced Humira 
was within the acceptance interval of 0.8 to 1.25. 
SB5-G31-RA 
Phase III trial: A randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre clinical study in 544 adult 
adalimumab-naïve patients (271 for SB5 and 273 for EU Humira) with moderate to severe active RA and 
with inadequate response to methotrexate, a pivotal clinical trial to demonstrate similarity in efficacy, 
safety, PK, and immunogenicity. 
The subjects received 40 mg of SB5 or EU Humira every other week by s.c. administration route. The 
subjects received concomitant MTX treatment, the dosing (10-25 mg/week) remaining stable and 
unchanged throughout the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was ACR20 response rate at week 24 in 
the PPS1 population and the biosimilarity was demonstrated if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the 
difference of the two proportions was entirely contained within the pre-justified equivalence margin of 
[-15%, 15%].  
The supportive analysis in the FAS population was conducted to explore the robustness of the ACR20 
responses. The equivalence margin was based on two RA studies by Keystone (2004) and Weinblatt 
(2003). After 24 weeks the Humira group was re-randomized 1:1 to continue with Humira or to switch to 
SB5. The study was continued up to 52 Weeks to explore long-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. 
After 52 Weeks of active treatment the study continued with 8 weeks safety follow-up period. The primary 
PK endpoint was Ctrough. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From Quality and non-clinical perspective,  
Module 3 of the SB5 dossier is of good quality and adequately provides information on the manufacturing 
and control of SB5. The Applicant demonstrates that when operating within the established input ranges 
for process parameters, a high quality medicinal product fulfilling its specifications can be reproducibly 
manufactured. The minor changes introduced into the manufacturing process during product 
development have been adequately described and demonstrated to have no impact on product quality.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 103/111 
 
 
 
 
In order to demonstrate biosimilarity on the quality level between SB5 and the reference medicinal 
product Humira, comprehensive physicochemical and biological comparability studies using state-of-the 
art analytical methods have been carried out. The comparability studies address the primary, secondary, 
and tertiary structures, post-translational modifications, purity/impurity profile, biological activity, as well 
as the degradation profile. Based on the studies, it can be concluded that for most quality attributes, SB5 
is similar to Humira. Where differences exist, these differences have been properly discussed and justified 
not to be of clinical relevance.  
In addition, from the non-clinical perspective, it is considered that the similarity between SB5 and Humira 
is supported in terms of in vivo functionality (inhibition of the arthritic symptoms) and toxicological, 
toxicokinetic and immunogenicity profiles. 
From the pharmacokinetic perspective, in the PK pivotal study the primary endpoints (i.e. AUCinf and 
Cmax) with their 90% CIs are within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125%. This applies to the 
initial analysis as well as the analysis with previously excluded subjects. The estimates of the geometric 
LS means ratios for the comparison of SB5 and EU sourced Humira for AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax of the 
sensitivity analysis  are 0.990, 0.905 and 0.913 and the corresponding 90%CIs ([0.885-1.108], 
[0.822-0.996], [0.801-1.040], respectively).  
The number of ADA-negative patients in study SB5-G12-NHV was very low and a meaningful assessment 
of the impact of ADA formation on PK parameters therefore was limited. The applicant analysed the 
influence of ADA formation on PK according to three different ADA titre subgroups. No meaningful 
difference was seen when comparing the means of AUCinf, Cmax, and AUClast across the three treatment 
groups (SB5, EU Humira, US Humira) in the ADA titre Low subgroup, ADA titre Med subgroup, and ADA 
titre High subgroup.  
From the clinical perspective, the proportion of subjects in PPS1 population reaching the ACR20 response 
rate at week 24 were 72.4% (173/239) and 72.2% (171/237) in the SB5 and EU Humira groups, 
respectively. The estimated difference in proportions was 0.1% and its 95% CI -7.83% - 8.13%, it being 
well contained within the pre-specified equivalence margin of ±15%. In the FAS population the 
corresponding response rates were 68.0% (183/269) and 67.4% (184/273) leading to the adjusted 
difference in proportions of 0.8% and 95% CI of -7.03 – 8.56%. Thus, regarding the primary outcome the 
study fulfilled the biosimilarity criteria.  
Also the secondary endpoints ACR50 and ACR70 were confined within the equivalence margin at week 24. 
At Week 52 the ACR20 for the PPS2 was 76.9% (163/212) in the SB5 and 71.2% (79/111) in the 
Humira/Humira treatment groups; the adjusted treatment difference was 5.6% [95% CI: −4.63%, 
15.90%] between the SB5 and Humira/Humira treatment groups. 
The similarity demonstrated in the primary endpoint is confirmed by secondary measures at week 24 such 
as DAS28 [treatment difference and its 95% CI for DAS28 at Week 24 was −0.04 [−0.26, 0.17], which 
was contained within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [−0.6, 0.6] as well as ACR50 and ACR70 
(−2.0% [−10.69%, 6.75%] and −1.3% [−8.41%, 5.80%], respectively). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
From Quality and Non-clinical perspective 
From the Quality perspective all uncertainties have been adequately addressed by the Applicant, no 
concerns remain.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 104/111 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition in the non-clinical PK evaluation an up to 30 % higher Cmax was observed in Humira in 
comparison to SB5-treated animals. The difference in exposure was not statistically significant due to the 
small group size. There was also considerable higher variation in mean serum concentrations for the 
Humira-treated animals than SB5-treated animals on Day 22. However, these nonclinical PK data are 
superseded by clinical PK data.  
From the pharmacokinetic perspective, several uncertainties related to bioanalytical methods were 
originally observed. The Applicant has provided further data and clarifications as requested and all 
remaining issues are solved. 
A PK sensitivity analysis was requested including the 16 subjects (9/2/5 from the SB5/EU Humira/US 
Humira treatment arms, respectively), who were excluded from the PK analysis according to protocol 
defined criteria (not enough concentration data in the elimination phase), but could still contribute data 
for calculation of Cmax. The analysis shows estimates of the GM ratio of the Cmax of SB5 vs EU Humira of 
0.905, the 90% CI (0.822; 0.996) being entirely contained in the acceptance range. A thorough 
investigation of the characteristics of excluded subjects (9 from the SB5 vs 2 from EU Humira group) 
showed that they tended to have higher BMIs and ADA titres compared with non-excluded subjects, which 
might result in lower absorption and faster clearance. Potential quality differences between SB5 and the 
reference product, which could also influence the absorption rate after extravascular administration, e.g. 
molecular weight or charge profiles, were also considered. However, data from extensive quality studies 
supports molecular similarity of SB5 and reference product, and the minor difference in acidic variants is 
not considered to translate into differences in biological activity. In summary, a difference in PK between 
SB5 and EU Humira cannot be concluded from this data.  
From the Clinical perspective the following uncertainties were observed: 
•  A 20% difference in the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 in the SB5 group with ADA positive patients 
in comparison to the ADA negative patients was observed while in the Humira group similar efficacy 
regardless of ADA status was seen; the frequency of ADA positivity was similar in Humira and SB5 
groups. The estimated difference between the SB5 and Humira group in ACR20 responses in ADA 
positive patients at Week 24 was −17.5% (95% CI −33.3%, −1.8%; p= 0.015). In ADA negative 
group the result was approximately comparable by 4.7% difference in ACR20 response rate (CI 
−3.8% - 15.2%). However, after further analyses this could be considered to be a chance finding. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
From a quality and non-clinical perspective no issues which contribute to unfavourable effects have been 
raised. 
The overall rate of TEAEs, SAEs, treatment discontinuations due to AEs, laboratory findings was similar 
for SB5 and Humira. The adverse events captured mirrored those already described in the SmPC for 
Humira. Patients who switched from Humira to SB5 demonstrated a similar safety profile to those 
subjects who stayed on their treatment for the whole study duration. 
Among healthy volunteers, TEAEs were observed in 57.1%, 46.0% and 61.9% of subjects in the SB5 
group, EU Humira and US Humira groups, respectively, most commonly nasopharyngitis and headache. 
No obvious signal of safety differences between SB5 and Humira was observed in the healthy volunteers.  
In RA patients, a total of 207 (38.3%) subjects reported 457 TEAEs at any time after the first dose of IP 
until Week 24; 96 (35.8%) subjects in the SB5 and 111 (40.7%) subjects in the Humira treatment 
groups, with no obvious differences between the SB5 and Humira-groups. The findings were similar up to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 105/111 
 
 
 
 
 
52 weeks (52.2% SB% and 54.3% Humira/Humira group reported TEAEs). The most frequently reported 
TEAEs during the 52 week period were nasopharyngitis (9%, 12.6% in the SB5 and 
Humira/Humira-groups), headache (4.1%, 4.7%), bronchitis (4.1%, 3.9%), alanine aminotransferase 
increased (3.4%, 5.5%), latent tuberculosis (4.1%, 5.5%), and upper respiratory tract infection (3.7%, 
0.8%); the most frequently reported TEAEs are in line with the know safety profile for Humira. There were 
5 AESIs reported during the study, all were infections. The overall rate of TEAEs was similar for SB5 and 
Humira.  
Immunogenicity seemed markedly higher than observed in the initial licensing studies for Humira. In the 
single dose study in healthy volunteers almost all patients were ADA-positive; the distribution of low, 
medium and high ADA titers was similar in SB5- and EU-Humira-treated patients. In RA-patients the 
incidences of ADAs were 32% and 31% in the SB5- and EU-Humira groups, respectively. Approximately 
half of the ADA-positive sera were positive in the NAb-assay. The occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions 
and injection site reactions (proportion of patients) was low and overall comparable. However, the 
number of reactions in these patients was higher in the Humira treated patients, compared to SB5 treated 
patients (up to week 52, 9 reactions in 8 subjects (3.0%) vs 32 reactions in 4 subjects (3.1% in 
Humira/Humira group). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
From a quality and preclinical perspective no issues which contribute to unfavourable effects have been 
raised. 
Although the submitted data do not give a reason for suspicion of differences in safety profile, no 
long-term data beyond 12 months are available. Post-marketing data gathering is important to obtain 
further information regarding the relative safety of SB5. Two registries for the follow-up of safety of 
relevant selected AEs, ARTIS (Anti-Rheumatic Treatment in Sweden) and BIOBADASER (Spanish Registry 
of Adverse Events of Biological Therapies), are proposed post marketing. 
The way causality was assessed in study SB5-G31-RA, could have led to variability of interpretation by 
investigators, and surprisingly high proportion of TEAEs were classified as “not related” to the IP, despite 
that these AEs represent typical adverse reactions associated with Humira. However, this is not 
considered to be of major importance to the assessment of safety, as safety is assessed mainly based on 
TEAEs (i.e. all AEs regardless of causality), the investigators were blinded to the IP during the study, and 
the main purpose in this study was to compare the safety of the biosimilar to that of the reference 
product, and thus most likely no bias has been introduced here between the groups. 
With regard to immunogenicity, the applicant has provided further information and data concerning 
assessment of ADA/NAb results and the issues are resolved. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
When evaluating a biosimilar application, it is of importance that all parts of the comparability exercise 
point in the same direction, which is the case here. 
An overall robust and adequately controlled manufacturing process for drug substance as well as for drug 
product is in place which can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce drug substance respective 
drug product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. The provided drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 106/111 
 
 
 
 
substance and drug product batch analyses data support this conclusion. An appropriate control strategy 
ensures that material of sufficient high quality will enter the market.  
Concerning the biosimilarity exercise a comparable profile for the majority of the quality attributes could 
be shown. A potential impact of differences in certain physicochemical characteristics has been ruled out 
by demonstrated similarity for the biological activity investigated by a broad panel of binding and in-vitro 
assays. It is not expected that the differences reported would impact the clinical performance of SB5. 
Therefore, from an analytical and biological point of view, similarity has been demonstrated.  
From a non-clinical perspective the similarity of SB5 and Humira has been shown with regard to in vivo 
PD, PK and toxicology. Statistically not significant differences in the PK of SB5 as compared to Humira are 
most probably attributable to the small group size of experimental animals and, thus, of no clinical 
relevance. 
On the clinical level, the company followed a stepwise approach and was able to demonstrate similarity 
between SB5 and Humira across the whole clinical development. In the single dose PK trial in healthy 
volunteers, the primary analysis revealed biosimilarity between the products.   
Evaluation of mean serum trough concentrations in a subgroup of patients in study SB5-G31-RA were 
comparable between treatment arms. Similarity was shown in most primary and secondary efficacy 
measures in study SB5-G31-RA, where the proportion of patients reaching ACR20 at week 24 was almost 
identical and the CI of the treatment difference well preserved within the predefined equivalence margins. 
Further, the ACR20 results were comparable between the groups across the whole study duration, also at 
the more sensitive earlier time points of the study. 
These results are affirmed by similarity in key secondary measures such as DAS28 at week 24, ACR50 and 
ACR70, at week 24 as well as week 52. Those findings, among others, emphasize that SB5 and Humira 
exhibit comparable efficacy profiles.  
A difference in ACR response between the subgroups of ADA positive patients was seen. In this subgroup 
a lower ACR response rate was observed in the SB5 treatment group compared to the EU Humira 
treatment group at Week 24. This finding was most pronounced for ACR20 (SB5 57.5%, Humira 71.2%). 
The company considers this to be a chance finding. The position of the Applicant is supported by the trend 
of decreased difference in ACR20 responses towards Week 52 and no difference observed between ADA 
positive treatment groups in DAS28 AUC (continuous variable), while in ACR AUC responses (categorical 
variables) the EU Humira group showed better response. Furthermore, the incidence, titres and 
neutralizing capacity of ADAs were comparable between the groups. Altogether, based on these data, and 
also taking into account the small number of patients in these different ADA-subgroups and somewhat 
fluctuating results in different endpoints at different time points, the difference between the groups in 
ACR20 responses could be assumed to be an isolated finding that is not compatible with ADA results, 
pharmacokinetics or the DAS28 results. Also the fact that efficacy was similar in ADA-negative and 
ADA-positive patients in the Humira group was an unusual finding contradicting previous data on 
adalimumab and thus pointing towards a chance finding. 
Based on the data provided by the Applicant on ACR and DAS28 response in NAb-positive and –negative 
patients in different time points showed no clear correlation between increased number of NAb-positive 
patients and efficacy. These data did not show any indication on the withering effect with increasing ADA 
positivity in long-term.  
In addition to clinical efficacy also safety looks comparable between SB5 and Humira. This is true for the 
incidence, kind and severity of AES, as well as the incidence and quality of ADA, across both trials. 
Extrapolation to all indications approved for the EU Humira is suggested. Adequate justification of the 
similarity in mechanism of action and in relevant target molecules for the disease development also 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 107/111 
 
 
 
 
between the newest indications of EU-Humira, namely HS and uveitis, and RA, has been provided to allow 
extrapolation. Complemented by the results obtained by functional assays to comparatively study the 
mechanism of action proposed for IBD indications (e.g., binding to tmTNF, apoptosis assay, inhibition of 
IL-8 cytokine release, regulatory macrophage function) and clinical models chosen to investigate 
biosimilarity are considered sufficiently sensitive to support extrapolation. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Biosimilarity from the quality, non-clinical, clinical PK, safety, and efficacy point of view has been 
demonstrated. 
The benefit-risk balance of SB5 is regarded as equal to the BR balance of Humira, which is positive. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imraldi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Imraldi is favourable in the following indication: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Imraldi in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for: 
• 
the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the 
response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been 
inadequate. 
• 
the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously 
treated with methotrexate. 
Imraldi can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment 
with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and 
to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Imraldi in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Imraldi can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/559383/2017  
Page 108/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and 
older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy  
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an 
inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate.  
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by 
X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease and to improve physical function.  
Psoriasis 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.  
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 
4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical 
therapy and phototherapies. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Imraldi is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional 
systemic HS therapy. 
Crohn’s disease 
Imraldi is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients who 
have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.

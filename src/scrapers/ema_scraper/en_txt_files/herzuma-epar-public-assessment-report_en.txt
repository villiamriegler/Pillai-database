2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The HER2 (also known as ErbB2) is one of a number of transmembrane 
tyrosine kinases involved in regulating cell growth and survival, as well as cellular adhesion, migration, 
differentiation, and other cellular responses1. Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of 
primary breast cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ 
hybridization (CISH) have shown that there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 
34.0% for IHC and 7.1% to 42.6% for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours 
overexpress HER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not 
overexpress HER2. HER2 overexpression was found in a number of disease states, including metastatic 
breast cancers, early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). The extracellular domain of the 
receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood stream and measured in serum samples (Herceptin 
SmPC section 5.1). 
Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta membrane region of HER2’s 
extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 signalling and 
prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of HER2. As a 
result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of 
human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody 
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to 
be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not 
overexpress HER2 (Herceptin SmPC section 5.1). 
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was first authorised in the EU on 28 August 2000 (see Herceptin EPAR) for the 
following indications: 
Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer: 
(MBC): 
-  as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an 
anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone 
receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable 
for these treatments.

4.4 and 5.1). 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
-  Herceptin in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or 
gastroesophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their 
metastatic disease. 
-  Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours 
have HER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an 
IHC 3+ result. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Herceptin is available as 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous 
administration and 600 mg solution for injection for subcutaneous administration. 
About the product 
CT-P6 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the reference product Herceptin for 
intravenous (IV) use with respect to pharmaceutical form, concentration and composition, and route of 
administration. The only difference is in the concentration of the excipient, trehalose. The formulated 
CT-P6 drug product is composed of 150 mg trastuzumab per vial. Herceptin was approved in the 
European Union (EU) in August 2000 (EMEA/H/C/000278).  
CT-P6 selectively binds to the extracellular domain of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 
(HER2). Binding of CT-P6 to HER2 blocks its dimerisation with the other receptors of the erbB family, and 
so prevents the consequent receptor activation which leads to tumour cell growth. Moreover, binding of 
CT-P6 to HER2 prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain and subsequent activation of 
its intracellular kinase domain, again preventing HER2 from stimulating a signalling cascade that causes 
tumour cells to grow.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The marketing authorisation application of Herzuma is an abridged application for a biosimilar under 
Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Herzuma (also referred to as CT-P6) is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that 
binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
and thereby prevents HER2 signalling. In addition, trastuzumab binds to Fc receptors on immune effector 
cells, facilitating immune destruction of HER2-expressing cancer cells. 
Herzuma is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. One vial contains 150 mg of 
trastuzumab produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cell suspension culture and purified by 
chromatographic and viral inactivation and filtration steps.  
Trastuzumab  is  formulated  with  L-histidine  hydrochloride,  L-histidine,  α,α-trehalose  dihydrate  and 
polysorbate 20. 
The reconstituted Herzuma solution contains 21 mg/mL of trastuzumab.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
CT-P6 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the reference medicinal product 
Herceptin (trastuzumab). CT-P6 active substance is a humanised monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 
subclass, produced in a CHO cell line. CT-P6 is a glycoprotein with one N-linked glycosylation site on the 
Asn300 in the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. The oligosaccharides are mostly G0F and G1F structures.  
The molecular formula for the heavy chain and light chain are C2192H3387N583O671S16 and 
C1032H1603N277O335S6, respectively. Each heavy chain consists of 449 amino acids (without the C-terminal 
lysine residue) with 11 cysteine residues and each light chain consists of 214 amino acids with 5 cysteine 
residues. All cysteine residues in the heavy and light chains are involved in either intra- or inter-disulphide 
bonding. The molecular weight of CT-P6 is approximately 145 kDa. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
CT-P6 active substance is manufactured packaged, stability and quality-control tested at Celltrion Inc., 
Plant  II,  Incheon,  Republic  of  Korea  (CLT2)  in  accordance  with  current  good  manufacturing  practice 
(cGMP).  
The  manufacturing  process  starts  with  thawing  of  one  WCB  vial  followed  by  a  series  of  cell  culture 
expansion steps until the production bioreactor step is reached.  The active substance is purified from the 
harvest using three chromatographic steps, followed by viral inactivation and removal steps, as well as an 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration step.  
The manufacturing process and process controls applied are adequately described. Information is given 
on  the  purpose  and  the  completion  of  each  manufacturing  step,  including  process  parameters  and 
in-process tests in place. The process parameter and in-process tests identified, as well as their criticality 
assignments are justified.

No reprocessing is foreseen for the manufacturing process of CT-P6. 
Control of materials 
The  CT-P6  cell  line  was  generated  using  the  CHO  strain.  A  two-tier  cell  bank  system,  consisting  of  a 
Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) was generated. MCB and WCB were characterised 
according to ICH requirements, e.g. Q5A (R1), Q5B and Q5D. Also, an End-of-Production Cell Bank (EPCB) 
was  generated  using  the  cells  from  commercial  scale.  Both  MCB  and  WCB  are  stored  frozen  at  two 
different  geographical  sites.  Future  replacement  WCBs  will  be  generated  from  the  existing  previously 
approved MCB. All newly prepared WCBs will be manufactured in accordance with cGMP guideline and 
qualified, complying with ICH Q5D and Q5A (R1) 
Raw materials of biological origin, as well as other raw materials used in the manufacture of CT-P6 active 
substance  are  listed  in  CTD  section  S.2.3.3.  All  raw  materials  are  purchased  against  an  approved 
specification and from qualified suppliers. Prior to supplying raw materials, all suppliers are evaluated and 
qualified  by  Quality  Assurance.  An  overview  of  the  filters,  disposable  bags  and  bottles  used  during 
downstream process is presented.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
For CT-P6, putative Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) relevant to CT-P6 active substance were established 
using a combination of risk assessment, data from early development, process characterisation studies 
and  commercial  scale  production.  The  CQAs  were  finalised  on  the  basis  of  commercial  scale 
manufacturing experience and characterisation/similarity of CT-P6 to the reference medicinal product. 
The  Applicant  has  established  CQAs  that  require  a  control  strategy  during  manufacture  of  active 
substance and/or at release.  
For establishment of the acceptance ranges/limits of the critical process parameters (CPPs), the Applicant 
provided summaries with sufficient data on the process characterisation studies conducted to justify the 
upper and/or lower acceptance limit for each CPP. 
Process validation 
A formal process consistency validation study has been carried out at the intended production site for 
CT-P6. The commercial scale manufacturing process was run according to target operational set points 
and/or  range.  HCCF  batches  were  produced  and  each  one  was  purified  and  filled  as  a  single  active 
substance  batch.  All  batches  satisfied  the  pre-defined  acceptance  criteria  and  acceptable  ranges  for 
critical process parameters, non-critical process parameters, critical in-process tests and in-process tests, 
respectively, and met the specification criteria for active substance release testing. 
An additional historical data assessment was undertaken after process validation, which incorporates an 
increased number of active substance batches that have been manufactured at commercial scale. Criteria 
for  process  related  impurities  were  slightly  adjusted  following  the  historical  data  assessment.  The 
capability of the purification process to reduce process-related impurities was sufficiently demonstrated 
by LRVs (Log10 reduction value) in small-scale studies. Historical data assessment through commercial 
scale  demonstrates  that  HCP,  DNA  and  rProtein  A  were  removed  predominantly  by  the  affinity 
chromatography  step  and  the  product  is  polished  with  respect  to  these  impurities,  throughout  the 
additional downstream process steps.  
Initially, a target maximum resin lifetime for the chromatography steps has been tentatively based on 
results obtained from qualified small-scale models. In case that the commercial scale resin lifetime study 
does not support the small scale study, the resin life times will be revised on the basis of the results from 
commercial  scale  study.  For  the  affinity  and  ion-exchange  chromatography  steps,  the  approach  is 
considered acceptable. The stability of mixed mode chromatography load pool seems to be decreased 
during the course of resin lifetime study indicated by decrease in monomer content. Based on the data 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 12/91 
 
 
 
and  justification  provided,  a  revised  maximum  resin  re-use  for  mixed  mode  chromatography  is 
acceptable.  
Maximum hold times were established for the 6 in-process pools in the CT-P6 manufacturing process. As 
CT-P6 active substance is stored frozen, the frozen active substance needs to be thawed prior to finished 
product manufacture. The Applicant has completed a validation study on the freeze and thaw times to be 
applied during commercial manufacturing, as well as on the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on the quality of 
CT-P6.  
Manufacturing process development 
The development of the CT-P6 manufacturing process can be divided into two stages; the old process and 
the clinical process. During process development and scale up, active substance manufacturing process 
changes were introduced in order to optimise the process for commercial manufacture. There are major 
differences between the old and the clinical process, however, only the clinical process has been used for 
manufacture of material to support CT-P6 as a biosimilar to Herceptin. Hence a comparability exercise is 
not required. 
Characterisation 
For the characterisation of CT-P6 a comprehensive series of analytical methods have been used. These 
methods  included  state-of  the  art  sensitive  and  orthogonal  physicochemical  and  biological  tests  to 
determine the primary, secondary, and higher-order structure, post-translational modifications (PTMs) 
and associated heterogeneities, glycosylation, charge variants, purity/impurities, and quantity of CT-P6. 
In addition, biological activity has been characterised with regard to the trastuzumab primary mechanism 
of action (HER2 binding and inhibition of cell signalling for proliferation), as well as secondary mechanism 
of  action  (ADCC,  as  well  as  FcγR  family,  FcRn  and  C1q  binding  affinities).  In  combination  with  the 
characterisation study results provided in CTD section 3.2.R.5, these studies are considered adequate and 
sufficient to provide a detailed characterisation of CT-P6.  
Clearance  validation  studies  have  been  performed  to  demonstrate  that  the  manufacturing  process 
provides  adequate  clearance  of  impurities.  The  batch  results  indicate  that  levels  of  process-related 
impurities are consistently low among the active substance batches. There are only two impurities not 
present in the reference product Herceptin, which present an inherently low risk of immunogenicity. The 
levels of these impurities are monitored and controlled as an in-process testing item at the UF/DF step. 
The  Applicant  has  developed  and  validated  analytical  methods  for  the  detection  of  the  two  novel 
impurities. The proposed control strategy for the impurities is considered acceptable.  
Further information related to characterisation of the active substance can be found in the biosimilarity 
section. 
Specification 
The active substance release specification for CT-P6 has been set taking ICH Q6B guideline into account; 
it  contains  tests  for  identity,  glycosylation,  purity/impurity  profile,  quantity  and  potency,  as  well  as 
general  and  safety  tests.  The  acceptance  criteria  are  adequate.  The  release  and  the  end-of-shelf-life 
specifications are identical, except that the tests for process-related impurities are only included in the 
release specification.  
Release data derived from commercial scale active substance batches were statistically processed to set 
the acceptance criteria for commercial batch release tests. Where appropriate, putative acceptance limits 
for individual test parameters were generated from historical batch data. The acceptance criteria defined 
for the specifications are generally acceptable and represent state-of-the-art limits. The proposed upper 
limit for afucosylated glycans has been adequately justified and is considered acceptable. However, the 
initially proposed lower active substance specification limit for afucosylated glycans had to be adjusted in 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 13/91 
 
 
 
order to be aligned to the levels seen in Herceptin pre-shift batches and ensure clinical performance of 
Herzuma (Kim et al., 2017, Drifts in ADCC-related quality attributes of Herceptin). The Applicant has 
revised the acceptance criterion for afucosylated glycans for routine control at release and in the 
end-of-shelf-life specification. This is acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
CT-P6  active  substance  is  tested  using  a  combination  of  compendial  and  non-compendial  methods. 
Non-compendial analytical methods used for CT-P6 routine testing have been validated in line with ICH 
Q2(R1). The performance of compendial methods has been verified in accordance with relevant Ph. Eur. 
Chapters.  
Batch analysis 
The proposed commercial specifications were developed based on statistical analysis of release data from 
the historical batches. 
Results for the impurities not present in the reference product conducted as in-process tests are attached 
to the active substance certificate of analyses. For all batches the predefined acceptance criteria were 
met. 
Reference standard 
The CT-P6 primary reference standard was derived from active substance batch manufactured using the 
proposed commercial scale manufacturing process. The reference standard was qualified as the primary 
reference standard in accordance with ICH Q6B ‘Specifications: Test procedures and acceptance criteria 
for  biotechnological/biological  products’.  Testing  according  to  the  pre-defined  specifications  and 
additional  characterisation  testing  was  used  to  qualify  the  primary  reference  standard.  The  primary 
reference  standard  is  stored  at  ≤ -60 ° C.  Re-qualification  will  be  performed  periodically  using  an 
acceptable  pre-defined  assay  panel  and  specification.  Test  Methods  and  Acceptance  Criteria  for 
Qualification and Requalification of a future CT-P6 Working Reference Standard is considered acceptable. 
A  new  reference  standard  will  be  assessed  by  the  battery  of  methodologies  and  the  pre-defined 
acceptance criteria for the current reference standard or, should the release acceptance criteria for active 
substance change, the acceptance criteria in place at that time. 
Container closure 
Leachable studies demonstrate that there is low level of leachable present in CT-P6 active substance, 
does not pose a safety risk when CT-P6 active substance. The bottles meet the relevant requirements of 
the Ph. Eur. 
Stability 
Long-term  stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  representative  batches  manufactured  using  the 
commercial  manufacturing  process  and  stored  in  reduced  size  containers  representative  for  the 
commercial scale containers. Stability data at long-term conditions together with data from studies at 
accelerated and stress conditions support a shelf life when stored at proposed temperature, according to 
the principles outlined in ICH Q5C. Studies are planned to be continued according to stability protocol. The 
stability of CT-P6 active substance has been adequately addressed.  
In addition to the long-term stability study, stability studies under intermediate condition, accelerated 
condition, stress condition as well as a photo-stability study have been performed.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The  CT-P6  finished  product  is  formulated  for  intravenous  infusion  as  a  sterile,  white  to  pale  yellow 
lyophilised powder containing 150 mg of CT-P6 active substance as the active ingredient, α,α-trehalose 
dihydrate, L-histidine HCl, L-histidine and polysorbate 20. There are no novel excipients or excipients of 
animal grade. The excipients used in CT-P6 finished product are the same as the excipients used in the 
formulation of the reference product, EU-approved Herceptin. However, the quantity of α,α-trehalose, 
dihydrate, has been increased for the formulation of CT-P6 finished product. According to the guideline on 
similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active  substance: 
quality  issues  (revision  1),  the  formulation  of  the  biosimilar  should  be  selected  taking  into  account 
state-of-the-art technology and does not need to be identical to that of the reference medicinal product. 
The formulation has been demonstrated to produce a product of acceptable quality and stability. All the 
excipients used in the formulation of CT-P6 finished product comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. To ensure 
the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial, a 4% volume overfill is applied during filling 
into vials. 
CT-P6 finished product (150 mg) is stored in a glass vial with rubber stopper and a flip-off seal. Leachable 
studies confirmed that no leached elements or chemicals were detected. The safety of the glass vial and 
the elastomeric stopper are ensured through compliance with Ph. Eur. requirements. The lyophilized 
powder is reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (SWFI) to yield a single dose 
formulation containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at pH 6.0. Prior to administration, reconstituted CT-P6 
finished product is diluted using 0.9% w/v sodium chloride in an infusion bag. The compatibility of the 
CT-P6 finished product with the infusion bags made from 3 different materials, polyethylene (PE), 
polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containing 9 mg/mL (0.9% w/v) sodium chloride 
solution for injection has been studied. 
Manufacturing process development 
During process development, several changes were implemented to optimise the production process for 
commercial  manufacture.  The  pre-change  finished  product  manufacturing  process  is  referred  to  as 
Process A. The post-change finished product manufacturing process is referred to as Process B. Process B 
is the proposed commercial finished product manufacturing process. Considering the level of changes, no 
significant  quality  difference  between  Process  A  and  Process  B  finished  product  lots  were  expected. 
However,  an  extensive  comparability  assessment  was  conducted  by  means  of  physicochemical  and 
biological testing items including release and characterisation analysis methods. Stability data were also 
compared between Process A and Process B finished product lots. The results of comparability testing 
showed that CT-P6 finished product manufactured by the two processes is comparable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Commercial CT-P6 finished product is manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The CT-P6 finished product 
manufacturing process consists of formulation of active substance, 1st filtration, aseptic filling (2nd sterile 
filtration),  lyophilisation,  capping  and  visual  inspection;  a  clear  step-by-step  description  of  the 
manufacturing process is provided.  
The provided overall control strategy for the finished product manufacturing process is acceptable. Raw 
and  starting  materials  are  tested  to  ensure  their  suitability  for  use  in  manufacture  of  CT-P6  finished 
product.  The  control  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  for  CT-P6  is  achieved  through 
applying  acceptable  ranges  for  process  parameters  (input  variables).  The  successful  control  of  the 
manufacturing process is evaluated through in-process tests (output variables). Process parameters and 
controls are indicated. CPPs and critical IPTs (CIPTs) are highlighted. The classification and the defined 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 15/91 
 
 
 
ranges  are  considered  acceptable.  Each  of  the  34  evaluated  process  variables  (input  and  output 
variables) have been classified as critical or non-critical on the basis of a risk assessment. All CPP and 
CIPT  have  designated  acceptance  criteria,  that  have  been  set  based  on  development  studies  and/or 
historical  manufacturing  data  and  process  validation.  Protein  content  and  microbiological  purity  have 
been identified as CQAs that can potentially be impacted by the finished product manufacturing process.  
The  Applicant  submitted  a  post-approval  change  management  protocol  (PACMP)  to  introduce  an 
alternative  container  closure  system  for  the  manufacturing  of  CT-P6  finished  product  to  ensure  the 
integrity  of  the  supply  chain  in  case  of  interruptions  in  the  supply  of  the  current  primary  packaging 
components. A new glass vial with a new suitable stopper will be used as an alternative primary container. 
The  alternative  container  closure  system  will  be  used  in  parallel  with  the  current  one.  The  proposed 
implementation plan (Type IB variation) is acceptable. The PACMP is considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
The  CT-P6  finished  product  manufacturing  process  was  validated  at  the  proposed  commercial 
manufacturing site. The validation studies included validation of formulation of the final bulk, 1st filtration, 
sterilization, aseptic filling (2nd filtration), lyophilisation, capping, and visual inspection. Both controlled 
process  parameters  as  well  as  output  parameters  with  pre-determined  acceptance  criteria  were 
evaluated.  
Media  fills  have  been  performed  on  a  routine  basis  in  accordance  with  EU-GMP  Annex  I.  Shipping 
validation  of  the  active  container  for  unlabelled  finished  product  was  performed  through  consecutive 
finished product shipments with maximum load configuration, which is considered acceptable.  
Product specification 
The  test  items  proposed  for  release  testing  are  largely  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia, as well as the CHMP guideline on monoclonal antibodies. The finished product release 
specification  includes  general  and  safety  tests,  identity,  purity/impurity,  content  and  potency.  The 
end-of-shelf-life  specification  is  identical  to  the  release  specification  except  that  in  the  release 
specification  identity  is  tested  only.  The  acceptance  criteria  for  commercial  lot  release  has  been 
established  based  on  CT-P6  finished  product  manufactured  throughout  development;  these  lots  were 
used  in  stability  and  similarity  studies,  as  well  as  validation  of  the  commercial  finished  product 
manufacturing  site.  The  proposed  acceptance  limits  are  set  sufficiently  tight  to  reflect  manufacturing 
experience,  as  well  as  the  quality  profile  of  batches  used  in  clinical  trials.  Moreover,  the  proposed 
acceptance criteria for purity, content and potency give a final assurance that the commercial CT-P6 will 
have a quality profile that is similar to Herceptin in the comprehensive characterisation studies. 
Analytical methods 
CT-P6 finished product is tested using a combination of compendial and non-compendial methods. For 
compendial  test  methods,  relevant  pharmacopoeial references  are  given  and  for  non-compendial  test 
methods, descriptions of the assay procedures are provided. The assay verification/qualification results 
for both compendial and non-compendial assays are provided indicating that the assays are suitable for 
the intended use and precise, specific and robust.  
Batch analysis 
The proposed commercial specification is based on statistical evaluation of the batch analysis results. For 
all batches the predefined acceptance criteria were met. 
Assessment report

Reference materials 
The reference standards used for extended characterisation, comparability testing, stability testing and 
routine  batch  release  testing  of  the  finished  product  are  the  same  as  those  employed  for  the  active 
substance. 
Stability of the product 
The storage condition proposed for the CT-P6 finished product is 5±3°C. Thus, a long-term stability study 
at  5±3°C  has  been  performed.  In  addition,  and  accelerated  stability  study  at  25±2°C/60±5%  RH  (6 
months)  and  a  stress  stability  study  at  40±2°C/75±5%  RH  (3  months)  have  been  conducted.  All 
evaluated stability parameters met acceptance criteria, and no significant trends could be observed. The 
applicant’s shelf life claim of 36 months at 5±3°C is considered to be supported by the provided data and 
is agreed. 
After reconstitution with sterile water for injection the reconstituted solution is physically and chemically 
stable for 48 hours at 2°C – 8°C. Any remaining reconstituted solution should be discarded. 
After  dilution,  solutions  of  Herzuma  for  intravenous  infusion  are  physically  and  chemically  stable  in 
polyvinylchloride  (PVC),  polyethylene  (PE)  or  polypropylene  (PP)  bags  containing  sodium  chloride  9 
mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection for 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Herzuma infusion solution should be 
used immediately. The product is not intended to be stored after reconstitution and dilution unless this 
has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If not used immediately, in-use storage 
times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
The results of the confirmatory photostability study indicate that the product is photostable when stored 
in its primary and secondary packaging. 
Adventitious agents 
The antibody is produced in a cell culture medium free of animal or human-derived components (except 
only one component used for active substance manufacturing). No raw materials of human origin are 
used during CT-P6 active substance and finished product manufacture. All animal derived raw materials 
used  for  the  production  of  CT-P6  have  been  evaluated  in  relation  to  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal 
spongiform encephalopathy agents. 
Mycoplasma and microbial bioburden are controlled during manufacture through use of a sanitary and/or 
aseptic process design. In-process materials, process buffers and media are filtered where applicable, 
with  in-process  tests  to  confirm  their  performance.  In-process  control  testing  for  bioburden  and 
endotoxin is also routinely carried out to ensure microbial safety throughout manufacture. Bioburden, 
sterility (finished product only) and endotoxin are included in the routine active substance and product 
release  strategies  which  ensure  only  materials  of  suitable  quality  with  respect  to  microbial  safety  are 
released for further processing or for commercial supply.  
The potential presence of endogenous and adventitious viruses in the MCB, WCB and EPCB were tested 
with validated methods. The virus tests failed to demonstrate the presence of viral contaminants. Only 
retrovirus-like particles have been detected. CHO cells are well known to produce endogenous retrovirus 
like particles. The presence of retroviral particles is acceptable since there is excess reduction capacity for 
retroviral particles within manufacturing process. Routine testing on unprocessed bulk is performed using 
indicator cell lines.  
Viral clearance studies have been conducted in accordance with the guidance given in ICH Q5A and other 
relevant guidelines. Four model viruses have been selected for the viral clearance studies (Xenotropic 
murine leukemia virus (XMuLV), Pseudorabies virus (PRV), reovirus type 3 (Reo-3) and minute virus of 
mice (MVM)). These viruses cover an adequate range of properties, including size, genome content, as

well as resistance low pH inactivation. The purification process includes four steps (2 chromatographic 
steps, low pH incubation and virus filtration) which have been validated for their virus reduction capacity. 
A sufficient overall virus inactivation/removal capacity has been demonstrated. Using scale-down models 
operating under worst-case conditions, four process steps have been assessed; affinity Chromatography, 
low pH treatment, Mixed Mode Chromatography and virus filtration. The overall minimum combined log10 
reduction  values  for  the  four  unit  operations  were  considered  satisfactory.  A  sufficient  overall  virus 
inactivation/removal  capacity  has  been  demonstrated.  The  maximum  volumetric  filter  load  and  low 
pressure are considered a worst case for virus reduction.  
Biosimilarity 
Reference product 
The  reference  product  for  CT-P6  in  EU  is  the  EU-authorised  Herceptin  (EU-Herceptin)  presented  as  a 
single dose vial containing 150 mg trastuzumab.  The presentation of the CT-P6 biosimilar intended for 
the EU market is the same as EU-Herceptin (i.e. 150 mg/vial). Also the excipients of CT-P6 are identical 
to EU-Herceptin, except for the quantity of α,α-trehalose, dihydrate, which has, based on formulation 
development studies been increased in CT-P6.  
US-licensed Herceptin (US-Herceptin) is presented in a multidose formulation containing 440 mg 
trastuzumab to be reconstituted with 20 mL of bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI) containing 1.1% 
benzyl alcohol. The final trastuzumab concentration in the reconstituted Herceptin is 21 mg/mL, which is 
the same as for EU-Herceptin. In the clinical studies, CT-P6 formulated as 440 mg/vial has been 
compared against US-Herceptin. The reference product, EU-Herceptin 150 mg/vial, has not been included 
in any clinical trial, therefore the bridge between the EU reference product (EU-Herceptin) and the 
comparator used in the clinical studies (US-Herceptin) needs to be established based on physicochemical 
and biological similarity studies. The Applicant has addressed this as part of the 3-way similarity 
assessment for biosimilarity. 
CT-P6 batches in the biosimilarity studies 
As the 440 mg/vial presentation of the biosimilar was used in the clinical trials, comparability between the 
150 mg/vial and the 440 mg/vial presentation of the biosimilar also has to be established. Considering 
that the trastuzumab concentration of the reconstituted product is, in both cases the same (21 mg/mL 
trastuzumab), an analytical comparability exercise is deemed sufficient. In this regard, the Applicant has 
conducted a comprehensive analytical characterisation study to address the comparability between the 
CT-P6 150 mg/vial and 440 mg/vial presentations. No relevant differences can be seen between the two 
presentations, comparability can therefore be concluded. It is consequently also considered acceptable to 
apply both 150 mg and 440 mg batches in the analytical similarity exercise. Furthermore, the use of the 
440 mg/vial presentation as the only CT-P6 included in the clinical studies is, from a quality point of view, 
justified. 
For the biosimilarity exercise, CT-P6 finished product, EU-Herceptin and US-Herceptin were analysed. The 
analysed CT-P6 batches include the 150 mg/vial presentation corresponding to EU-Herceptin as well as 
the 440 mg/vial presentation which is the presentation intended for the US market. Overall, the number 
of batches is sufficient to both estimate the batch-to-batch variability present in the reference product, as 
well as to assess the similarity between CT-P6, EU-Herceptin and, US-Herceptin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 18/91 
 
 
 
Similarity ranges 
Ranges for the assessment of biological similarity have been established based on descriptive statistical 
ranges determined from the analysed EU-Herceptin batches. Similarity is concluded if at least 90% of the 
CT-P6 batches fall inside the similarity ranges. The similarity criteria applied is not considered to provide 
strong  evidence  for  biosimilarity.  However,  as  characterisation  results  from  all  batches  analysed  are 
given, similarity can be assessed independently of the established similarity ranges. 
Study results of 3-way similarity assessment (Tables 1 and 2) 
Analytical methods 
All analytical methods used for the similarity assessment have either been validated (release and stability 
methods) or qualified for the intended use (additional physicochemical and biological test methods).  
Primary- and higher order structures 
The primary structures of CT-P6, EU- and US-Herceptin were compared by amino acid analysis, molar 
absorptivity (molar extinction coefficient), peptide mapping by HPLC, peptide mapping in combination 
with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) (including assessment of deamidation, oxidation 
and isomerisation), intact mass analysis (LC-MS), N-terminal and C-terminal sequencing. Expect for a 
minor difference in C-terminal proline amidation which was found to be higher in CT-P6 compared EU- and 
US-Herceptin,  no  significant  differences  between  the  three  products  were  detected.  The  difference  in 
proline amidation is not expected to be clinically relevant. Similarity with regard to primary structures is 
thereby concluded.  
The comparative results on disulphide bridging (peptide mapping and free thiol analysis), as well as the 
results  from  assays  addressing  higher  order  structures  (Fournier  transform  infra-red  (FTIR),  circular 
dichroism  (CD),  differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  and  antibody  array),  all  suggest  similarity 
between CT-P6, EU-Herceptin and US-Herceptin. 
Purity and impurities 
As measured by either SEC-HPLC or SEC multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS), the purity of all 
three finished products is higher than 99%. In SEC-HPLC, the range of high  molecular weight (HMW) 
species for CT-P6 finished product was marginally lower than that of EU- and US-Herceptin. This minor 
difference is of no clinical significance. The results from AUC analyses confirm the similarity.  
Using CE-SDS under reducing condition, a slightly higher level of non-glycosylated heavy chain variants 
were seen in CT-P6 compared to both EU- and US-Herceptin. In addition, under non-reducing conditions, 
the level of intact IgG was marginally lower in CT-P6  compared to EU- and US-Herceptin. These small 
differences are not expected to affect the function of the antibody. 
Charge variants 
While  no  differences  between  CT-P6,  EU-Herceptin  and  US-Herceptin  is  seen  by  IEF,  some  minor 
differences appear to be present when analysed by IEC-HPLC. The acidic peaks (sum of peaks 1, 2, 3 and 
4) of all three products show similar relative proportions. But for the main peak (peak 5), there could be 
a  slight  difference  with  a  possibly  lower  relative  proportion  in  CT-P6  and  US-Herceptin  compared  to 
EU-Herceptin. In addition, for peak 6, slightly lower levels are seen in CT-P6. Also for peak 7 a small 
difference is detected with higher relative proportions in CT-P6 than in EU- or US-Herceptin.  
In order to understand the impact of these minor differences, the Applicant conducted a comprehensive 
peak  fractionation  study,  including  identification  of  the  molecular  variants  present  in  each  peak.  In 
addition, the biological activity was separately measured from the fractionated peaks. Except for peak 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 19/91 
 
 
 
for which activity could not be calculated in the anti-proliferation assay, no significant differences in the 
anti-proliferation activity or in binding to HER2, C1q, FcγRIIIa, and FcRn of the 7 fractionated peaks can 
be seen. Since peak 6 represents a minor fraction of the total charge variants, based on characterisation 
results presented, it can be agreed that the differences in the charge variant profiles between CT-P6 and 
EU-Herceptin are of no clinical concern. 
Glycosylation 
In  the  2-AB  labelled  oligosaccharide  profiling  using  hydrophilic  interaction  liquid  ultra-performance 
chromatography  (HILIC-UPLC)  analyses,  generally  good  agreement  on  the  types  and  proportions  of 
glycans present in CT-P6 and EU- and US-Herceptin was seen. For the minor glycan variants, practically 
no  differences  are  detected.  However,  based  on  mean  contents  from  the  analysed  batches,  the  main 
glycoform G0F appears to be present at a lower level in CT-P6 compared to Herceptin. Similar results are 
also presented from N-linked glycan analysis based on peptide analyses by LC-MS.  
With regard to sialic acid content, relatively higher N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) levels were obtained 
for all CT-P6 batches compared to EU-Herceptin and US-Herceptin. The N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) 
levels were similarly low in all three products. 
In order to justify the minor differences in the glycan profiles, the Applicant has studied the influence of 
aglycosylation, agalactosylation, amannosylation and asialylation on the binding and anti-proliferation 
activities of Herceptin and CT-P6. As expected, aglycosylation impacted FcγRIIIa-V binding similarly in all 
samples. However, as no significant differences in aglycosylation levels are seen between CT-P6, EU- and 
US-Herceptin, this correlation is of no concern. Binding to FcRn and HER2, as well as the anti-proliferation 
activity  of  trastuzumab  were  not  affected.  Together  these  studies  provide  assurance  that  the  minor 
differences in galactosylated species and sialylated glycans do not impact the function of the antibody.  
Content 
In  the  comparison  for  protein  content,  several  CT-P6  batches  were  shown  to  have  lower  protein 
concentrations  compared  to  the  minimum  concentration  measured  from  the  analysed  EU-Herceptin 
batches. Despite this, the protein content of all measured CT-P6 batches are within margins of the EU 
Herceptin batches. Similarity between the three products with regard to protein content can thereby be 
concluded despite the observed minor difference in the mean protein concentration of the three products.  
Biological similarity assessment 
For the assessment of biological similarity the Applicant has compared HER2 binding (ELISA), cell-based 
binding affinity of CT-P6 and EU-/US-Herceptin to HER2 overexpressing cells, in vitro bioactivity in an 
anti-proliferation assay, C1q binding (ELISA), FcgRI, IIa, IIb, IIIa-V, IIIa-F, IIIb and FcRn binding (SPR), 
ADCC  using  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMC)  as  effector  cells,  and  ADCC  using  a  reporter 
assay.  The  data  suggest  that  CT-P6  and  Herceptin  can  be  considered  similar  as  the  pre-defined 
biosimilarity ranges are met. It is noted that regarding binding to FcγIIIa-V, IIIa-F, IIIb and ADCC activity 
there  is  a  higher  batch-to-batch  consistency  of  CT-P6  compared  to  both  EU-  and  US-Herceptin  and 
considering the means of all batches there is a slightly higher binding affinity and ADCC activity of CT-P6 
compared to EU- and US-Herceptin.  
The binding results from the cell-based assay further confirm similarity with regard to binding to HER2. 
Altogether, similarity between CT-P6 and EU-Herceptin, as well as between EU- and US-Herceptin has 
been demonstrated for the in vitro bioactivity assay.   
Additional mode of action studies 
To further support the claim of biosimilarity between CT-P6 and EU-Herceptin, as well as between EU- and 
US-Herceptin, the Applicant has conducted an array of in vitro studies relevant or potentially relevant for 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 20/91 
 
 
 
the  mode  of  action  of  trastuzumab.  These  studies  show  comparable  activities  in  the  inhibition  of 
proteolytic cleavage of HER2 extracellular domain (ECD), down-regulation of HER2 expression, inhibition 
of downstream signalling pathways, induction of cell cycle arrest, suppression of VEGF secretion activity, 
and in the induction of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Higher variability is observed in 
the assay for inhibition of Akt1 and HER3 phosphorylation and in the FACS-based cell cycle arrest assay. 
These differences are, however, small and within the variability of the assays, and therefore they do not 
impact the similarity claim.  
Forced degradation studies 
In addition to the physicochemical and biological comparison, the Applicant has conducted comparative 
force degradation stability studies. The treatment conditions included; oxidizing (H2O2) conditions, UV 
exposed conditions, high temperature, as well as low and  high pH conditions. As expected, all forced 
degradation conditions resulted in changes in the quality profiles of CT-P6 (both 150 mg and 440 mg 
presentation included), EU- and US-Herceptin. Importantly, however, similar degradation patterns were 
seen  for  all  products  thereby  confirming  the  similarity  between  CT-P6  (150  mg  and  440  mg), 
EU-Herceptin and US-Herceptin.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Module 3 of the dossier for CT-P6 is of good quality and the information provided is sufficiently detailed. 
Overall, the quality of Herzuma is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with  existing  guidelines.  The  fermentation  and  purification  of  the  active  substance  are  adequately 
described,  controlled  and  validated.  The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  with  regard  to  its 
physicochemical  and  biological  characteristics,  using  state-of  the-art  methods,  and  appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and  validated.  The  quality  of  the  finished  product  is  controlled  by  adequate  test  methods  and 
specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been 
sufficiently assured.  
Similarity between CT-P6 and the reference product, EU-Herceptin, has been addressed in an extensive 
comparability  exercise.  The  similarity  between  CT-P6  (150  mg/vial  intended  for  the  EU  market)  and 
EU-Herceptin  can  be  confirmed.  In  addition,  based  on  the  comprehensive  analytical  and  biological 
Assessment report

characterisation studies conducted, the bridge between the reference product (EU-Herceptin) and the 
comparator (US-Herceptin) used in clinical trials has been successfully demonstrated. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall Quality of Herzuma is considered acceptable. 
Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Herceptin has been sufficiently demonstrated. From a 
quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been well 
documented and are acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A 3-way similarity exercise was undertaken, to demonstrate the similarity of CT-P6 to EU-approved 
Herceptin and also to demonstrate the similarity of US-licensed Herceptin (440 mg) to EU-approved 
Herceptin (150 mg).  
The applicant submitted non-clinical studies with sensitive test methods to demonstrate similarity. The 
non-clinical studies included a 3-way similarity study comparing analysis of primary, secondary and 
tertiary structure, glycan profiles and of post-translational modifications. In addition, many biological and 
analytical assays were performed evaluating comparative affinity binding, ADCC function and FcγRII and 
FcγRIII binding as similarity to trastuzumab (Herceptin). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Inhibition of HER2 Extracellular Domain Cleavage 
Trastuzumab has been shown to block cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER2, thus, preventing 
formation of the constitutively active membrane-bound 95-kDa HER2 protein called p95 HER22. HER2 
shedding is also activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), a well-known matrix 
metalloprotease activator, in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Thus, the inhibition of 
APMA-induced cleavage of HER2 by trastuzumab and prevention of the production of an active truncated 
HER2 fragment represents one of the MoAs of trastuzumab. 
BT-474 cells, a human breast cancer cell line, were incubated with EU-approved Herceptin, CT-P6 drug 
product and US-licensed Herceptin, at 3 concentrations  with APMA and subsequently incubated for 2 
hours with human ErBb2 detection antibody. Results of the extracellular cleavage domain are presented 
in Figure 1.

Binding to HER2  
In vitro binding affinity to HER2 was analysed with ELISA and in a cell-based system. Binding to HER2 
expressed on the cell surface is a key mechanism for trastuzumab to exert its therapeutic effect. 
The total mean for relative binding affinities of CT-P6, EU-approved Herceptin and US-licensed Herceptin 
were within 97%-100% using an ELISA method.  
The total mean for relative binding affinities on cell based system (on HER2 overexpressing human breast 
cancer cells SK-BR3) using cell-based ELISA (CELISA) of CT-P6, EU-approved Herceptin and US-licensed 
Herceptin were within 99% - 102%. 
CT-P6 lots in these HER2 binding studies were within mean ± 3SD of EU-approved Herceptin and thus, the 
binding affinities of CT-P6 and reference products were considered highly similar. 
Down-regulation of HER2 Expression 
In vitro Herceptin treatment down-regulates the HER2 expression resulting in inhibition of downstream 
signaling pathways involved in cell survival, cell proliferation and metastasis. Hence, down-regulation of 
HER2  expression  by  the  treatment  of  EU-approved  Herceptin,  CT-P6  drug  product  and  US-licensed 
Herceptin to HER2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells on cell surface were determined using the cell-based 
HER2 binding affinity ELISA. 
SK-BR-3  cells  were  incubated  with  EU-approved  Herceptin,  CT-P6  drug  product  and  US-licensed 
Herceptin  (5,  150  and  2,000  ng/mL)and  cell  surface  HER2  expression  was  detected  and  measured. 
Results are presented in Figure 2.

In vitro bioactivity (anti-proliferation activity) 
The in vitro functional activity of CT-P6 and Herceptin were compared in HER2 overexpressing human 
breast  cancer  cells  (BT-474).  The  total  mean  for  relative  in  vitro  bioactivity  of  CT-P6,  EU-approved 
Herceptin and US-licensed Herceptin were within 101% - 105%. All lots of CT-P6 were within mean ± 3SD 
of EU-approved  Herceptin for anti-proliferative activity. The potencies of CT-P6 and reference products 
were highly similar. 
Induction of Cell Cycle Arrest 
The cell cycle arrest effect of EU-approved Herceptin, CT-P6 drug product and US-licensed Herceptin at 
G1 phase was assessed using FACS analysis in breast cancer cell line, SK-BR-3 cells. 
SK-BR-3  cells  were  incubated  with  EU-approved  Herceptin,  CT-P6  drug  product  and  US-licensed 
Herceptin  (final  concentration:  133  ng/mL).  The  cell  cycle  arrest  was  assessed  by  flow  cytometry  to 
analyse the DNA content of target cells stained with propidium iodide (PI) using FACS analysis.

Scatter Plot for Induction of Cell Cycle Arrest Results 
Suppression of VEGF Secretion 
HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells secrete VEGF at high levels, which leads to angiogenesis 
in site of the tumour3. Herceptin is thought to act through suppression of VEGF secretion in breast tumour 
cell.  In  this  study,  the  VEGF  suppression  activity  of  EU-approved  Herceptin,  CT-P6  drug  product  and 
US-licensed Herceptin was evaluated and compared in vitro. 
BT-474 cells were incubated with EU-approved Herceptin, CT-P6 drug product and US-licensed Herceptin 
at three concentrations and VEGF production was measured with cell supernatant.

Antibody Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis 
Monocytes were isolated from human PBMCs and treated with GM-CSF for 10 – 14 days to enable 
differentiation into macrophages. The SK-BR-3 cells were stained with PKH67 green fluorescent cell linker 
kit and incubated for 30 minutes with EU-approved Herceptin, CT-P6 drug product and US-licensed 
Herceptin. Macrophages were incubated for 3 hours at effector: target ratio of 1:1with antibody-treated 
SK-BR-3 cells and after incubation, were stained with CD11b-APC for FACS analysis.

Binding to FC receptors and C1q 
The comparative in vitro to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa V- and F-type receptors, FcγRIIIb, FcRn 
binding affinity studies with SPR were conducted. Relative KD values were calculated by comparison of KD 
values of test articles with those of reference standard.  In addition, the binding affinity to C1q of CT-P6 
was compared to Herceptin (EU, US) with the ELISA method. The total mean (range) for relative binding 
affinities of each parameters tested of CT-P6, EU-approved Herceptin and US-licensed Herceptin were 
considered highly similar.

In vitro Fc-related bioactivity (ADCC activity) 
Two  types  of  ADCC  analyses  were  conducted  in  order  to  evaluate  the  comparability  of  CT-P6  and 
Herceptin (EU, US) in regards of their ADCC induction activities.  
In first, cytotoxicity was studied with Calcein-AM assay using 3 concentrations (0.5 ng/mL, 1.3 ng/mL and 
3.2  ng/mL)  of  antibody  and  with  PBMCs  as  effector  cells  from  healthy  donors  and  HER2-expressing 
SK-BR3 breast cancer cells as target cells. PBMC to target cell ratio used was 16:1. The relative ADCC 
activities  of  CT-P6,  EU-approved  Herceptin  and  US-licensed  Herceptin  were  calculated  by  comparison 
with % cell lysis of reference standard. The mean  for ADCC activity of CT-P6, EU-approved Herceptin and 
US-licensed Herceptin were within 91% - 99%.  
The  second  analysis,  a  reporter  assay  utilising  luminescence  for  quantitation  of  the  cytotoxicity  was 
conducted on 2:1 ratio of engineered Jurkat cells as effector cells and HER2-expressing SK-BR3 breast 
cancer cells as target cells. The  mean for ADCC activity of CT-P6, EU-approved Herceptin and US-licensed 
Herceptin were within 82% - 99%.  
All lots of CT-P6 in both of the ADCC assays conducted were within mean ± 3SD of EU-approved Herceptin 
for ADCC activity. Therefore, the potencies of CT-P6 and reference products were highly similar.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
GLP-compliant comparative toxicokinetic study was conducted as part of the repeated dose toxicity study 
in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (Study  ZIP0014).    The  monkeys  (n=3  M,  F  /  group)  received  CT-P6  and  US 
Herceptin  at  doses  of  14  and  42  mg/kg  weekly  by  intravenous  (IV)  injections  for  4  –  weeks.  Blood 
samples were collected pre-dose and on Day 1 and Day 22 and serum concentrations of CT-P6 or US 
Herceptin were analysed 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 72, 120 and 168 hours post dose. 
Serum concentrations of CT-P6 and US Herceptin were measured with validated ELISA methods.  
Mean Cmax of CT-P6 and US Herceptin and mean AUC0-168h with standard deviations (SD) on Day 1 and Day 
22 are shown in Table 4 below. Serum concentration –time profiles for CT-P6 and US Herceptin are shown 
in Figure 6. The systemic exposure AUC0-168h of monkeys to CT-P6, increased with increasing dose over 
the dose range 14 to 42 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 22. The systemic exposure AUC0-168h of monkeys to US 
Herceptin, increased approximately proportionately with increasing dose. The mean accumulation ratios, 
based on AUC0-168h values, are indicated in Table 5.

There was no significant differences between the extent of systemic exposure AUC0-168h to CT-P6 and US 
Herceptin at the 42 mg/kg dose level (p=0.963) and at dose level 14 mg/kg in male monkeys. However, 
the  AUC0-168h  values  of  14  mg/kg  CT-P6  in  females  were  ~22%  lower  and  statistically  significant 
(p=0.003) than those of US Herceptin.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The applicant did not submit single dose toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study with weekly IV administration of CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin® 
was conducted in both male and female Cynomolgus monkeys at 2 doses of 14 and 42 mg/kg (Study No. 
ZIP0014), performed in compliance with OECD GLP according to EU requirements. 
Clinical observations 
There were no deaths during the treatment period and no clinical signs that were considered related to 
treatment. 
Observations at the injection sites included bruising, thickening, swelling and eschar formation. 
There were no consistent differences in the incidence of these findings for CT-P6 or US Herceptin® treated 
animals compared with the control. The findings were within the background of injection site findings 
observed with intravenous dosing and were therefore attributed to the method of dose administration. 
Ophthalmoscopy 
There were no treatment-related ophthalmic changes observed. 
Electrocardiography and blood pressure 
The electrocardiographic and blood pressure investigations performed in this study during Week 1 and 4 
did not reveal any treatment-related effects of CT-P6 or US Herceptin administration. 
Respiration rate 
There were no treatment-related effects on respiration rate. 
Body temperature 
There were no treatment-related effects on body temperature. 
Haematology, peripheral blood 
There were no treatment-related effects on the haematological parameters investigated. All inter-group 
differences (including those attaining statistical significance) were either minor, lacked dose-relationship, 
were not consistent between sexes or reflected trends that were apparent before treatment commenced 
and were therefore attributed to normal biological variation. 
Blood chemistry 
There were no treatment-related effects on the blood chemistry parameters investigated. All inter-group 
differences (including those attaining statistical significance) were either minor, lacked dose-relationship, 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 31/91 
 
 
 
were not consistent between sexes or reflected trends that were apparent before treatment commenced 
and were therefore attributed to normal biological variation. 
Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood leucocytes 
No clear or consistent differences were observed between dosing with CT-P6 and US Herceptin® in the cell 
types measured. Although some statistically significant differences in the group mean results were 
observed, there was either no relationship to dose level or no consistency between the sexes and they 
were therefore considered unrelated to treatment and due to normal background variation. 
Urinalysis 
The composition of the urine was considered unaffected by treatment. All inter-group differences 
(including those attaining statistical significance) were either minor, lacked dose-relationship, were not 
consistent between sexes or reflected trends that were apparent before treatment commenced and were 
therefore attributed to normal biological variation. 
Organ weights 
Intergroup differences seen in the organ weight analysis were small or were inconsistent between groups 
and sexes. Consequently, they were considered due to individual variation in results and were not 
treatment related. 
Macropathology 
The macroscopic examination performed after 4 weeks of treatment with CT-P6 or US Herceptin revealed 
no test article-related findings. Dark areas were occasionally observed in the subcutis of the right 
saphenous vein injection site (used for the last dose on Day 22) for treated and control animals, but were 
considered procedural in origin. The nature and incidence of all other findings were consistent with the 
commonly observed background of macroscopic changes 
Histopathology 
No treatment-related microscopic findings were observed. Occasional incidences of perivascular 
haemorrhage and perivascular fibrosis occurred in the saphenous vein injection sites. In the right 
injection site, the perivascular haemorrhage correlated with the dark areas observed macroscopically. 
These findings were observed for treated and control animals and were attributed to the intravenous 
administration procedure and were considered unrelated to treatment with CT-P6 or US Herceptin®. 
The nature and incidence of all other findings were consistent with the commonly observed background of 
microscopic changes. 
Genotoxicity 
The applicant did not submit genotoxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit carcinogenicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant did not submit reproduction toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion).

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance in the injection site was assessed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies as part of the gross 
pathology and histopathology evaluations. Dark areas at the injection site were observed in the 4-week 
repeat-dose toxicity  study  (Study  ZIP0014)  in  treated  and  control  animals,  suggesting  their  technical 
procedural  relation.  No  differences  were  noted  in  the  occasional  incidences  of  these  local  tolerance 
findings  (macroscopical:  bruising,  thickening,  swelling  and  eschar  formation;  histopathology: 
perivascular  haemorrhage,  perivascular  fibrosis  in  saphenous  vein)  between  CT-P6  and  US  Herceptin 
treatments (Table 6).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided a justification for not providing an environmental risk assessment. Trastuzumab is 
already marketed and no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated with CT-P6. 
Furthermore, the "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use" 
(EMENCHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2*) makes specific reference for certain types of products such as 
proteins, that due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
Therefore, considering that CT-P6 is a protein and there is no expected increased environmental 
exposure, the absence of formal environmental risk assessment studies for CT-P6 is considered justified. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
CT-P6 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the reference product Herceptin 
(trastuzumab). The marketing authorisation is an abridged application for a biosimilar under the scope of 
the Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC. According to Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues Guideline 
on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: 
non-clinical and clinical issues EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1, the applicant used a stepwise 
approach in order to demonstrate that CT-P6 is comparable to Herceptin with respect to PD/PK and 
toxicity. Studies regarding safety pharmacology, reproduction toxicology, and carcinogenicity and on 
local tolerance are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars and therefore the lack of studies is 
acceptable. 
A 3-way similarity exercise was undertaken, to demonstrate the similarity of CT-P6 to EU-approved 
Herceptin and also to demonstrate the similarity of US-licensed Herceptin (440 mg) to EU-approved 
Herceptin (150 mg). The 3-way similarity study included an extensive comparative analysis of primary, 
secondary and tertiary structure, glycan profiles and of post-translational modifications. In addition, 
many biological assays have been included to evaluate similarity in all biological activities associated with 
Fab- and Fc mediated functions involving primary mechanisms of actions (MoAs) of trastuzumab 
(Herceptin). No significant differences were observed in these assays. EU-approved Herceptin, CT-P6 
drug product and US-licensed Herceptin were considered similar in binding affinity to HER2. These studies 
establish a robust scientific non-clinical bridge between the 3 products.  
To evaluate PK and toxicity of CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin, a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys was used in both male and female Cynomolgus monkeys at 2 doses of 14 and 42 
mg/kg. The 14 and 42 mg/kg doses yielded measurable concentration up to 7 days on Week 1 and Week 
4. Overall the results indicate that CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin had similar concentration-time 
profiles and PK parameters. The study showed no toxicological findings and no difference in response 
compared to treatment with US Herceptin. 
All animals were confirmed to be negative for the presence of anti-CT-P6 or anti-US Herceptin antibodies. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical studies were considered comprehensive and support the comparability exercise 
to confirm the biosimilarity between CT-P6 and the reference product Herceptin.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme consisted in one PK similarity study conducted in healthy subjects 
(Study CT-P6 1.5) and one comparability clinical efficacy study conducted in patients with early breast 
cancer (EBC) (Study CT-P6 3.2). In addition, one pilot study to evaluate the safety and PK of Herzuma 
was conducted in healthy subjects (Study CT-P6 1.4) prior to the initiation of the two similarity studies. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Due to concerns raised with regard to the quality of the assays performed and to the overall quality of the 
data (see discussion on clinical pharmacology), an inspection was conducted to examine whether the 
study CT-P6 3.2 was conducted in accordance with ICH GCP, applicable regulations and internationally 
accepted ethical standards, and to verify the reliability of the data reported in the MAA. Despite some 
deviations from GCP, the final conclusion of the inspection was that the overall conduct of the trial was 
GCP-compliant. The data of the trial are consequently considered acceptable and the inspectors 
recommend using the data of the trial in context of the evaluation of the MAA of Herzuma.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics data were generated from two clinical trials: the pivotal PK study healthy subjects 
(Study CT-P6 1.5) and the pilot study evaluating the initial safety and PK of Herzuma in healthy subjects 
(Study CT-P6 1.4). Supportive PK parameters were also determined as secondary endpoints during the 
pivotal efficacy trial, CT-P6 3.2. All three studies used the US-licensed Herceptin as the comparator. As 
the 440 mg/vial presentation of the biosimilar was used in the clinical trials, comparability between the 
150 mg/vial and the 440 mg/vial presentation of the biosimilar has been established. 
Analytical methods  
CT-P6 and Herceptin levels in human serum from Study CT-P6 1.5, CT-P6 3.2 and CT-P6 1.4 were 
quantitatively measured using a ligand-binding immunoassay (Gyros method).  
Re-analysis of study samples using a newly developed and validated ELISA assay was also conducted 
during the procedure (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
Pivotal PK similarity study: Study CT-P6 1.5  
Study CT-P6 1.5 was a randomised, double-blind, two-arm, parallel group, single-dose Phase 1 study to 
compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of CT-P6 and Herceptin in healthy subjects 
and conducted at two sites in the US.  
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018

A total of 70 healthy male subjects (aged 18-55 years) were enrolled to the study; 35 subjects (including 
12 Japanese subjects in each arm) in both treatment groups (i.e. in CT-P6 group and in US-licensed 
Herceptin group).  In the CT-P6 group, all subjects completed the study, in the US-licensed Herceptin 
group, 1 subject discontinued (reason for discontinuation was other). The demographic baseline 
characteristics were comparable between studied treatment groups. 
All subjects received a single-dose (6 mg/kg) of either CT-P6 or US-licensed Herceptin by intravenous 
(i.v.) infusion for 90 minutes (± 5 min) on day 1 followed by 10 weeks study period. 
Blood  samples  for  PK  analysis  of  trastuzumab  were  drawn  pre-dose,  immediately  after  the 
end-of-infusion (1.5 hours from the start of infusion) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours from start of infusion, on 
days 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 50, and at the end-of-study visit on day 71.  
Immunogenicity of CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin was assessed before dosing on day 1 and on days 50 
and 71. The potential immunogenicity of CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin was assessed by measuring 
ADA and Nab. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the PK profiles of CT-P6 and US-licensed 
Herceptin in healthy subjects. 
Primary PK endpoints were: Area under the concentration-time curve from the start of first infusion to 
infinity  (AUCinf),  area  under  the  serum  concentration-time  curve  from  the  time  zero  to  the  last 
quantifiable concentration (AUClast) and Cmax.  
Secondary  PK  endpoints  were:  %AUCext,  time  to  maximum  serum  concentration  (Tmax),  volume  of 
distribution  during  the  terminal  phase  Vz,  terminal  elimination  rate  constant  λz,  terminal  elimination 
half-life t 1/2 and total body clearance CL. 
The statistical analysis of the log-transformed primary endpoints (AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax) was based on 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect and race (Japanese and 
Non-Japanese) as a covariate. The equivalence margin was pre-defined: 90% CIs around the ratio of 
geometric means for AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax contained within 80-125%.

Pilot PK Similarity Study: Study CT-P6 1.4 
Study CT-P6 1.4 was a randomised, double blind, two-arm, parallel-group, single-dose initial Phase 1 
study designed to evaluate the PK profile, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of CT-P6 and Herceptin 
in healthy subjects and conducted in one site in the Philippines.  
A total of 70 healthy males (aged 18 to 55 years) were enrolled to the study (35 subjects in both studied 
treatment  groups);  34  subjects  and  33  subjects  completed  the  study  in  the  CT-P6  group  and  in  the 
US-licensed Herceptin group, respectively. One subject in the US-licensed Herceptin had major protocol 
deviation and was excluded from the PK analyses (i.e. n = 32 in the US-licensed Herceptin group). The 
demographic characteristics were similar in the two treatment groups. 
The test product was CT-P6 440 mg/vial powder for concentrate for solution for injection manufactured by 
Celltrion Inc. and the reference product was US-licensed Herceptin (440 mg/vial powder for concentrate 
for solution for injection) manufactured by Genentech Inc.  
All subjects received a single dose of 6 mg/kg trastuzumab of CT-P6 or US-licensed Herceptin as a 90 
minutes i.v. infusion with an infusion pump. The study period was up to 6 weeks. 
Blood samples for PK assessments were collected into serum sample tubes at pre-dose (within 60 minutes 
prior to the beginning of the IMP infusion), 1.5 hours (immediately after the end of infusion), and then at 
3, 6, 12 hours after the start of infusion and at days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 (after the start of the 
infusion).  The  blood  samples  for  assessment  of  antibodies  to  trastuzumab  were  collected  on  day  0 
pre-dose, at days 14, 28 and 42. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the PK profiles of CT-P6 and US-licensed 
Herceptin in healthy male subjects.  
Primary PK endpoints were: AUC last and Cmax 
Secondary PK endpoints were: AUCinf, Tmax, Vz, λz, t 1/2 and CL 
Immunogenicity endpoint was: Immunogenicity of CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin

Bioequivalence of PK parameters was determined by constructing 90% confidence intervals around the 
estimated  difference  between  the  test  and  reference  treatments  using  ANOVA  based  on  natural  log 
transformed data (treatment as fixed effect and group as covariate).

Pivotal Therapeutic Equivalence Study: Study CT-P6 3.2 in Patients with HER2-Positive Early 
Breast Cancer 
Study CT-P6 3.2 was a pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled study 
in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive EBC conducted globally which 
also provided supportive PK data with Ctrough and Cmax as secondary endpoints.  
This study compared the efficacy and safety of CT-P6 and Herceptin during the neoadjuvant period (24 
weeks (8 cycles) including surgery) as primary endpoint and PK as secondary endpoints (see section on 
clinical efficacy). 
The PK was studied during the neoadjuvant period (8 cycles i.e. 24 weeks). In the neoadjuvant period, 
CT-P6 or Herceptin was administered as a 90-minute i.v. infusion (± 5 min, with an adequate infusion 
pump) at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 1, and then 6 mg/kg repeated every 3 weeks (from 
cycle 2 to cycle 8). Patients also received docetaxel during Cycles 1 through 4 and FEC during Cycles 5 
through 8. Docetaxel and FEC were administered on the day of CT-P6 or Herceptin administration (Day 1, 
3-week cycles). 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected before study drug (CT-P6 or US-licensed Herceptin) 
administration (within 15 minutes prior to the beginning of the study drug infusion) and within 15 minutes 
after the end of the study drug infusion for each cycle during the neoadjuvant period. After the completion 
of treatment, an additional PK sample was collected at the first end-of-treatment visit. 
The following PK parameters were included as secondary endpoints: 
•  Observed Cmax after administration, at each dose 
•  Observed trough serum concentration (Ctrough), prior to next dose for cycles 1 through 7 and at 
the first end-of-treatment visit for cycle 8.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The design of the pivotal PK study in male healthy volunteers is in-line with the guidance in the CHMP 
biosimilar monoclonal antibody guideline (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and is acceptable. As the 
440 mg/vial presentation of the biosimilar was used in the clinical trials, comparability between the 150 
mg/vial and the 440 mg/vial presentation of the biosimilar has been established. 
Single doses of 6 mg/kg CT-P6 and Herceptin were selected in the two PK studies as this represents the 
recommended dose of Herceptin used to treat patients with trastuzumab in both breast cancer and gastric 
cancer (Herceptin SmPC 2016) which is agreed.  
The comparative repeat dose PK was further investigated in Study CT-P6 3.2 in early breast cancer (EBC) 
patients as secondary objective with a three-weekly regime as recommended in breast and gastric cancer 
patients. This is considered acceptable as EBC patients are less likely to be exposed to prior 
chemotherapy treatments and represent a more sensitive and homogenous patient population for 
evaluating similarity in clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity as well as efficacy compared to MBC 
and AGC patients. 
The comparison of the presented single dose PK results (AUC0-inf, AUC0- last and Cmax) and also of 
secondary PK  endpoints (Tmax, Vz, λz, t 1/2, CL) of CT-P6 versus US Herceptin in study CT-P6 1.4 and 
CT-P6 1.5 in healthy volunteers indicates biosimilarity.  
Likewise, the presented PK data in EBC patients (study CT-P6 3.2) supports similarity between the CT-P6 
and Herceptin treatment groups. However, a marked difference in exposure (geometric mean Ctrough 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 46/91 
 
 
 
 
pre-dose cycle 8: 15.7 µg/mL; CV 99%) was observed for both drugs compared to the value expected in 
that population (51.8 µg/mL). In addition, the observation that Ctrough after cycle 1 was not different from 
end of cycle 8 and all Ctrough were constant over all 7 cycles for both CT-P6 and Herceptin is uncommon. 
Usually, accumulation would take place with the given posology, as is observed in population predicted 
cycle 1  and steady state PK for all indications, i.e. MBC, EBC and MGC (SmPC Herceptin 2016, Table 14 
and 15).  
The applicant undertook a multidisciplinary investigation in order to find explanations for the unexpected 
PK findings of both CT-P6 and Herceptin in study CT-P6 3.2.  
Firstly, the applicant re-evaluated the PK assay method validation. The sensitivity of the assay was 
questioned as LOQ was close to the lowest Ctrough levels (mean: 18 µg/mL, CV% > 100). The low 
sensitivity was attributed to a high minimum required dilution (MRD) of 1:1000. However, accuracy and 
precision in the low concentration range (LQC) was within acceptable limits. Additional validation tests by 
the applicant confirmed a strong similarity of calibration curves of all three products, as well as dilutional 
linearity for a 1:100 dilution (pre-dilution to fall within the quantitative range of the assay). Additional 
validation tests showed that neither sHER2 and ADAs present in samples have any impact on the accuracy 
of the PK determination. In addition, a review of the QC performance during clinical sample analysis did 
not reveal any bias. Overall, validation of the PK assays used for sample analysis from clinical studies is 
considered adequate. 
Secondly, a GCP inspection of the laboratory did not identify critical findings. Further to this inspection, no 
GCP-related reasons for the high CV% or for underestimation of samples could be identified.  
Thirdly, the applicant conducted a thorough comparison of Study CT-P6 3.2 and the HannaH study4 
including inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to determine any differences between the studies. No 
significant differences were observed which could have impacted PK.  
Fourthly, re-calculated results of primary PK parameters from Studies CT-P6 1.5, CT-P6 1.4 and CT-P6 
3.2 after setting all values BLQ (< 5 μg/mL) to 0 or missing did not change the results significantly (data 
not shown). Furthermore, dose-response evaluation has not confirmed a threshold of 20 μg/mL for a 
therapeutic response of trastuzumab as previously suggested in the HannaH study. 
Finally, a comparison of the PK method used in Study CT-P6 3.2 with the ELISA platform used for 
measurement of clinical samples in the HannaH study was done and highlighted differences. As a 
consequence, the applicant has developed and validated a new assay mimicking the assay format used in 
the Hannah study. Using the newly developed ELISA method, Ctrough samples from the Neoadjuvant 
Period of Study CT-P6 3.2 in EBC patients were re-analysed and the results replicated the results from the 
HannaH study and supported similarity. The additional analysis of the PK samples from Study CT-P6 1.5 
using the new ELISA method resulted in increased AUC levels compared to the result from the original 
data using the Gyros method. The 90% CIs of ratios of geometric means for AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax were 
entirely contained within the equivalence margin of 80% to 125% further supporting the PK similarity 
between CT-P6 and Herceptin. 
Potential source of the differences in PK results between the Gyros and the ELISA methods was 
thoroughly discussed by the applicant, e.g. possible factors such as pre-existing immunocomplexes of 
trastuzumab and sHER2, and known in vivo modifications of trastuzumab (e.g. deamidation, glycation). 
High baseline levels of HER2 shed antigen were observed in the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups 
which might have influenced free trastuzumab levels.  
Overall, it was concluded that the assay platform was the cause for the difference between observed and 
expected results in the original submission, i.e. systematically lower trastuzumab levels in both healthy 
subjects and patients (irrespective of the study sites) and a lack of accumulation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 47/91 
 
 
 
Plausible and consistent PK data of trastuzumab in healthy volunteers and EBC patients have now been 
obtained by the applicant after re-analysis of study samples using a newly developed and validated ELISA 
assay. PK similarity between CT-P6 and Herceptin was replicated across both Studies CT-P6 1.5 and 
CT-P6 3.2. 
Only the US-Herceptin has been used in the PK comparability studies. Comparability between the two 
CT-P6 presentations (150 mg/vial intended for EU and 440 mg/vial used in the similarity exercise) has 
been demonstrated and the bridge between the reference product (EU-Herceptin) and the comparator 
used in clinical studies (US-Herceptin) has been confirmed. 
No clinical comparability PD studies have been performed which is considered acceptable considering no 
validated PD biomarkers exist for trastuzumab efficacy. Studies on the mechanism of action were not 
provided which is acceptable for a biosimilar.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic data support the comparability exercise between Herzuma and the reference 
product Herceptin. It is considered that similarity, from a PK perspective, has been established.

Treatments 
CT-P6 or Herceptin 
During the Neoadjuvant Period, study drug was administered at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg body weight on 
Day 1 of Cycle 1, and then 6 mg/kg body weight repeated every 3 weeks (from Cycles 2 through 8). 
During the adjuvant treatment, patients will receive 6 mg/kg body weight of CT-P6 or Herceptin as 
randomized, repeated every 3 weeks for up to 1 year from the first day of study drug administration in the 
Neoadjuvant Period, excluding surgery (up to 10 cycles after surgery). 
Study drug was administered as a 90-minute IV infusion (±5 minutes) with an adequate infusion pump. 
Patients also received docetaxel (75 mg/m2) during Cycles 1 through 4 and FEC (5-fluorouracil 500 
mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) during Cycles 5 through 8. Docetaxel 
and FEC were administered on the day of CT-P6 or Herceptin administration (Day 1, 3-week cycles). 
Premedication consisting of an oral corticosteroid was administered prior to docetaxel unless 
contraindicated. Premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antipyretics could have been 
used before study drug infusion (CT-P6 or Herceptin) in patients who had experienced infusion-related

symptoms, at the investigator’s discretion. Patients who experienced a life-threatening (NCI CTCAE grade 
4) infusion reaction (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, tachypnea, bronchospasm, hypotension, 
or hypoxia) were required to discontinue treatment. 
Following surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy, including axillary lymph node assessment [sentinel 
lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection], was completed within 3 to 6 weeks after the last 
dose of CT-P6 or Herceptin during the Neoadjuvant Period) followed by monotherapy trastzumab every 3 
weeks for up to one year from the first day of study drug administration in the Neoadjuvant period.  
During the Adjuvant Period, patients may undergo radiotherapy and/or hormone therapy (e.g. tamoxifen 
or aromatase inhibitors), at the investigator’s discretion. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate equivalence of CT-P6 and Herceptin, both given 
in combination with docetaxel (Cycles 1 through 4) followed by 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide (FEC) (Cycles 5 through 8), in terms of efficacy as determined by pathological 
complete response (pCR), in patients with HER2-positive operable early breast cancer. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the following additional efficacy parameters:  
•  Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response 
(BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation 
Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) Version 1.1 
•  Disease-free survival (DFS), measured from the time of occurrence of attained CR to disease 
recurrence or death as a result of any cause 
•  Progression-free survival (PFS), measured from the randomization to disease recurrence, 
progression or death from any cause 
•  Overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to death from any cause 
•  Breast conservation rate, measured as the proportion of patients who undergo breast conservation 
surgery 
Other pCRs 
•  pCR of the breast only (pCRB) – different from definition used in the HannaH trial, where bpCR was 
defined as “absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast”. 
• 
pCR of breast and axillary nodes with absence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)  
and to obtain additional PK, pharmacodynamic, safety, and biomarker data in patients with HER2-positive 
early breast cancer. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of Study CT-P6 3.2 is the proportion of patients achieving pCR, defined as 
the absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and in axillary lymph nodes regardless of DCIS. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 52/91 
 
 
 
 
pCR was determined following surgery, using haematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast 
specimen.  
Pathological CR was be evaluated at the local level for treatment practice. The pathological review report, 
which is issued locally, will be evaluated centrally by an independent reviewer for reporting purposes. 
Review of pathological tumour assessment results will be performed by a blinded medical reviewer. 
−  Evaluation of pCRs: 
• 
• 
pCR of breast and axillary nodes with absence of DCIS 
pCR of breast only 
−  Breast pCR in accordance with criteria in the HannaH study (here: post-hoc analysis).  
−  ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST guideline Version 1.1 
−  Breast conservation rate, measured as the proportion of patients who underwent breast conservation 
surgery 
−  Time-To-Event Analysis: Due to the extremely low number of expected events in the Neoadjuvant 
Period of the study, the Time-To-Event Analyses will be carried out upon completion of the Adjuvant 
Period. 
•  DFS measured from the date of occurrence of attained CR to disease recurrence or death from 
any cause whichever occurs first 
• 
PFS defined as the interval between randomisation and determined disease recurrence, 
progression, or death from any cause 
•  OS defined as the interval between randomisation and death from any cause 
An Independent Tumour Review Committee (ITRC) was used to review the pathology reports and safety 
assessments, and determine tumour response for the purposes of data analysis and reporting. 
Secondary purposes of this study are also to obtain additional PK, PD, safety, immunogenicity and 
biomarker (optional) data in patients with HER2-positive EBC. 
Sample size 
From a meta-analysis of 6 studies conducted with FEC with taxane, pCR rate was estimated about 
15.88%. Pooling results from the 4 key experimental studies performed with trastuzumab, patients who 
received taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) with trastuzumab followed by FEC plus trastuzumab regimen 
showed a 53.74% pCR rate. The difference in the pCR between patient groups who received the regimen 
without trastuzumab and with trastuzumab was 37.86%. This difference was used to define the 
equivalence margin (+/- 15%) as it represents half of the combined difference mentioned above. 
Furthermore it was expected that replacement of the FEC regimen with EC and 3-weekly administration 
of trastuzumab would not change the size of the effect of trastuzumab treatment. 
Based on the results seen in the individual studies mentioned above it has been assumed that 50% of 
patients in each treatment group will have pCR. Assuming 15% equivalence margin, with alpha = 0.025 
(two one-sided), analysis of 239 patients in each treatment group during Neoadjuvant Period (total n = 
478) will provide at least 80% power to establish equivalence (i.e. that the 95% CI of the difference in the 
proportions of responders will be entirely bounded by the interval (–0.15, 0.15)). 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 53/91 
 
 
 
 
Considering a dropout rate of 10%, it was calculated that 532 patients have to be enrolled in order to 
achieve 478 evaluable patients. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized applying a 1:1 ratio to receive CT-P6 or Herceptin. Randomization was 
balanced by using permuted blocks and was stratified for disease stage (Stage I or II versus Stage IIIa), 
oestrogen and progesterone receptor status (positive versus negative), and country. An IVRS/IWRS was 
used to administer the randomization schedule. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Data were summarized using descriptive statistics (continuous data: n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies) unless otherwise 
indicated.  
There were 3 analysis sets: intent-to-treat (ITT) set consisting of all patients who were allocated a 
randomization number by IVRS/IWRS (analyzed as randomized), per-protocol set (PPS) excluding 
patients with major protocol violations, and safety analysis set (SAF). A total of 13 GCP non-compliant 
patients who enrolled in a Latvian site were excluded from all analysis sets. Due to vial label manipulation 
and incorrect investigational product assignment, the identity of treatment could not be verified in 13 out 
of 18 patients enrolled at the site. Post-hoc analysis for including those patients was performed. 
The primary set for the efficacy analysis was the PPS. The ITT set was used for supportive and sensitivity 
analyses. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving pCR, defined as the absence of 
invasive tumour cells in the breast and in axillary lymph nodes, regardless of DCIS. The proportion of 
patients achieving pCR was analyzed by the exact binomial approach, calculating a point estimate and 
95% confidence interval (CI) on the PPS and ITT set for the difference in proportion between the 2 
treatment groups (CT-P6 and Herceptin). The exact CI was produced by the unconditional approach. 
Equivalence with regard to pCR was concluded if the confidence limits of the 95% CI of the difference in 
the proportions of responders were entirely bounded by the interval (-0.15 – 0.15). 
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the primary endpoint, utilizing a logistic regression model, with 
treatment group (CT-P6 or Herceptin) as a fixed effect and disease stage (Stage I or II versus Stage IIIa), 
estrogen and progesterone receptor status (positive versus negative), and country as covariates. For 
disease stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, the variables recorded in the eCRF were used. 
Country was pooled into region (EMEA versus America versus Asia) for statistical models, as appropriate. 
Region was only to be used in the statistical model when there were not enough patients within each 
country to allow the analysis to converge. Use of region instead of country in the statistical model was 
confirmed at the blinded DRM. The resulting odds ratio and 95% CI was converted into difference of 
proportions using the Delta method for the purpose of comparison.  
According to the protocol there were 4 secondary efficacy parameters: ORR, breast conservation rate 
(BCR), other pCRs (pCRB, pCR of breast and axillary nodes with absence of DCIS) and time to event 
endpoints (DFS, PFS, OS). The categorical endpoints ORR, BCR and other pCRs were described using 
Assessment report

summary table and calculating exact 95% CI’s for the corresponding point estimates. In addition for other 
pCRs a point estimate and 95% CI on the PPS and ITT set for the difference in proportion between the 2 
treatment groups (CT-P6 and Herceptin) was calculated. 
The analyses of secondary time-to-event endpoints (DFS, PFS, and OS) were not included for the current 
analyses.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 549 patients were randomly assigned to study drugs and initiated the Neoadjuvant Period (271 
patients and 278 patients in the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups, respectively). 
The majority of patients in each treatment group completed the Neoadjuvant Period including pCR 
assessment (258/271 [95.2%] patients and 261/278 [93.9%] patients in the CT-P6 and Herceptin 
treatment groups, respectively).

3.2, ITT Set and PPS 
The primary endpoint of the study was met. The number of responders in the CT-P6 and Herceptin 
treatment groups were 46.8% patients and 50.4% patients, respectively, leading to a minor difference of 
– 3.6% for CT-P6 treated patients. The 95% CI for the estimate of treatment difference was - 12.38%, 
5.16% which is entirely contained within the equivalence range of  -15% to 15% thus supporting 
biosimilarity. In the HannaH study4, Gianni et al.5 and Buzdar et al.6 studies, a direct comparison of the 
reference product with placebo, was used to justify  a ± 12.5% non-inferiority margin and the results 
from Study CT-P6 3.2 have met this criterion when applied retrospectively as well (see Figure 11).

Comparing the efficacy results of studyCT-P6 3.2  with “reference” trials in EBC, the observed pCR results 
fell into the range of reported  pCR data as observed in the literature (65.2% [15/23] in Buzdar et al., 
61.4% [51/83] in Pernas et al.7, 58.3% [137/235] in Bayraktar et al.8.  
Secondary endpoints 
Breast Surgery and Pathological Response 
After completion of neoadjuvant treatment, patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer. 
Methods of surgical procedures performed were similar between the 2 treatment groups within the PPS as 
shown below. 
Table 22:

pCR of Breast and Axillary Nodes with Absence of DCIS 
The secondary endpoint pCR of breast and axillary nodes with absence of DCIS is comparable between the 
two arms with 39.9% CT-P6 patients and 41.4% Herceptin patients, respectively. The 95% CI for the 
estimate of treatment difference is (-10.22%, 7.31%) The results are confirmed in the ITT analysis.

Pathological Complete Response Rate of the Breast and Axilla nodes with 
pCR of the Breast Only 
The secondary endpoint data for breast only pCR (pCRB) seem comparable between the two treatment 
arms at 4.8% versus 4.7%, respectively.  
The study results demonstrate highly similar efficacy of both treatment arms regardless of definition of 
pCR thus supporting biosimilarity (see Table 24). 
Table 24: 
Response Rate (95% CI) of pCR Results in Study CT-P6 3.2 
Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
The proportion of patients who achieved an overall response was the same in the two arms with CT-P6 
(84.3%) and Herceptin (84.0%) patients thus supporting similarity. Albeit differences in assessment 
method between CT-P6 3.2. and HannaH, the observed ORR, also differentiating CR, PR are  highly similar 
and in the range of those observed for iv trastuzumab by Ismael et al., 2012, i.e. CR: 21.2%, PR: 67.7% 
versus 21.4 % and 62.9%. Further, time to response (ORR) in the CT-P6 treatment group was similar to 
that in the Herceptin treatment group in the neoadjuvant part of the study.

The results for breast conservation from the PPS and ITT set were consistent supporting the similarity 
between the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups. 
Breast Conservation Rate 
In the PPS, the proportions of patients who underwent ‘lumpectomy (breast conservation surgery)’ were 
similar between the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups (56/248 [22.6%] patients and 52/256 
[20.3%] patients, respectively). The 95% CI were similar between the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment 
groups ([17.5%, 28.3%] and [15.6%, 25.8%], respectively).  
The proportions of patients who underwent ‘lumpectomy’ in the ITT set were consistent with those in the 
PPS. 
Ancillary analyses 
Pathological Complete Response Rate: Logistic Regression Method 
A logistic regression analysis of the primary endpoint, pCR, with the treatment group (CT-P6 or Herceptin) 
as a fixed effect and disease stage (Stage I or II vs. Stage IIIa), estrogen receptor status (positive vs. 
negative), progesterone receptor status (positive vs. negative), region as covariates was performed in 
order to further investigate the consistency of the results when compared to the unadjusted result.  
The logistic regression results for the primary efficacy endpoint are summarised for the PPS and ITT set 
as shown below.

Noncompliant  patients in one Latvian site: Binomial Method 
In a post-hoc manner, a sensitivity analysis including GCP non-compliant 13 patients in the ITT set was 
carried out to assess the impact on the inclusion of these patients on the primary efficacy endpoint, pCR.  
The proportions of patients achieving pCR including GCP non-compliant patients were analysed in the ITT 
set only and the result was similar between the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups (43.2% [95% CI: 
37.3%, 49.2%] patients and 47.2% [95% CI: 41.3%, 53.2%] patients respectively). The 95% CI for the 
estimate of treatment difference (-12.33%, 4.26%) was entirely contained within the range -15% to 15% 
further supporting therapeutic equivalence between the treatment groups 
Sensitivity Analysis in PPS – Pathological Complete Response Rate Excluding 3 Additional 
Patients with Major Deviations: Binomial Method  
The proportions of patients achieving pCR excluding the 3 patients with major deviations in the PPS were 
similar between the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups (46.7% [95% CI: 40.4%, 53.2%] patients 
and 50.2% [95% CI: 43.9%, 56.5%] patients, respectively). The 95% CI for the estimate of treatment 
difference (-12.23%, 5.35%) was entirely contained within the range -15% to 15% supporting 
therapeutic equivalence between the treatment groups

Notes 
Equivalence has been shown. 
The primary analysis results are supported by the outcome of the ITT analysis as 
the 95%-CI for the difference in incidences for the ITT (-11.98%, 4.8%) is within 
the pre-specified equivalence range. Sensitivity analyses by means of a logistic 
regression accounting for the strata used for randomisation also support the 
conclusion of equivalence within the pre-defined equivalence range. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The Applicant has also conducted a number of additional meta-analyses in order to ascertain the 
application of constancy assumption in determining the equivalence margin used for Study CT-P6 3.2 in 
all 3 new meta-analyses that were performed which included 1) newly published studies 2) allowing 
different periods of trastuzumab exposure and 3) less rigid requirements for similar chemotherapy 
regimen (fluorouracil not mandated). Of note is that despite the difference meta-analyses performed 
applying different selection criteria, the overall pCR rate barely changed; the original meta-analysis gave 
an overall pCR rate of 54% (95% CI: 38% - 70%), and the meta-analysis which expanded to include the 
3 newly identified studies gave an overall pCR rate of 50% (95% CI: 39% - 61%). In addition, the 
meta-analyses which were expanded to 11 studies with wider inclusion criteria or 15 studies 
encompassing regimens both with and without the inclusion of fluorouracil gave an overall rate of 49% 
(95% CI: 43% - 56%) and 47% (95% CI: 40% - 53%), respectively. 
Efficacy data from Study CT-P6 3.2 were indirectly compared to historical data from the pivotal Herceptin 
studies.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme to show biosimilarity between CT-P6 and Herceptin is based on a 
single Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of CT-P6 and US Herceptin in women with newly 
diagnosed HER2 positive early or locally advanced breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. This study is 
on-going but data on the primary efficacy endpoint and several key secondary endpoints obtained during 
the neoadjuvant period is complete. As per cut-off date of 28 February 2017, median follow up of patients 
was 19.3 months in the CT-P6 arm and 19.6 months in the Herceptin arm and, respectively and 234/ 271 
patients in the CT-P6 arm and 254/278 patients in the Herceptin arm entered the Post-treatment 
Follow-up Period phase. The adjuvant period is of special interest as the study drug was administered in 
the absence of concomitant chemotherapy and thus allows for sensitive comparison between the 
biosimilar candidate and the reference drug.

The choice of the indication, the clinical setting, the primary and secondary endpoints and the chosen 
equivalence range are endorsed. The clinical model is considered sufficiently sensitive to enable the 
detection of differences between the two products.  As primary endpoint the applicant has justified the 
use of tpCR (= total pCR, breast and axilla regardless of, i.e. including DCIS) as opposed to bpCR (=breast 
pCR) for demonstrating comparability on the basis of other approvals which is acceptable. Primary 
assessment was conducted by the local investigators and independently reviewed data was used for the 
purposes of data analysis and reporting.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline characteristics, region (EMEA vs. America vs. Asia), fertility status, ECOG status at screening 
and disease duration (days) are well balanced. The majority of patients were enrolled in the EMEA region 
(431/549 [78.5%] patients). Especially regarding hormone receptor status, which is known to correlate 
with pCR response, no difference between the patient populations could be observed. The use of 
concomitant medication in Study CT-P6 3.2 was in line with the profile of concomitant medications and 
specifically usage of chemotherapy backbone regimen and may have positively impacted safety results in 
both arms. Study drug exposure (CT-P6 and Herceptin) and also Docetaxel and FEC exposure were 
similar. In summary demographic data, baseline characteristics reveal only minor differences not leading 
to any unidirectional bias. Mastectomy, lumpectomy and all 3 levels of the most frequently reported types 
of axillary dissection were largely similar between the 2 treatment groups. Overall, demographic data, 
baseline characteristics  and type of surgery reveal some minor  differences between the two arms not 
leading to an unidirectional bias, that could potentially impact the clinical outcome, e.g. slightly more  
advanced stages for the CT-P6 arm ; but higher rate of sentinel node biopsy with lower positive detection 
rate in Herceptin arm. 
The primary endpoint of this study was total pCR (tpCR) and an equivalence margin was chosen such that 
it preserves half of the difference between chemotherapy only and combined therapy with trastuzumab 
seen in comparable studies. Specifically, as a result from a meta-analysis of 6 studies conducted with FEC 
with taxane, pCR rate was estimated about 16%. Pooling results from the 4 key experimental studies 
performed with trastuzumab, patients who received taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) with trastuzumab 
followed by FEC plus trastuzumab regimen showed a 54% pCR rate. The difference in the pCR between 
patient groups who received the regimen without trastuzumab and with trastuzumab was 38%. This 
difference from a statistical viewpoint justifies a 15% equivalence margin for planning purposes. 
However, the equivalence margin for a biosimilar product to its reference product also needs to be 
clinically justified on a difference that can be considered clinically irrelevant. 
The primary endpoint of the study was met. The number of responders in the CT-P6 and Herceptin 
treatment groups were 46.8% patients and 50.4% patients, respectively, leading to a minor difference of 
– 3.6% for CT-P6 treated patients. The 95% CI for the estimate of treatment difference was - 12.38%, 
5.16%. Also, based on a direct comparison of the reference product with placebo as investigated in the 
HannaH4 and other studies, Gianni et al. and Buzdar et al. a ± 12.5% non-inferiority margin could be 
defined and the results from Study CT-P6 3.2 have met this criterion when applied retrospectively as well.  
There were differences in the pCR rates in the Herceptin arm in the Study CT-P6 3.2 and the original 
HannaH-study even though the two trial designs were highly similar, questioning the validity of the 
statistical assumptions and sensitivity of the trial to detect a difference between the Herzuma and 
Herceptin study arms. Consequently, the applicant provided upon CHMP’s request, a detailed comparison 
of the study design and baseline characteristics of the patient populations and a comprehensive review of 
factors that might affect the pCR rates including other relevant studies identified through a 
comprehensive literature search. The most likely contributing factor to the observed differences in the 
pCR rates was a difference in the disease stage at baseline, which was substantially higher in the HannaH 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 70/91 
 
 
 
study. A subgroup analysis of CT-P6 patients indicated that the patients with the highest disease stage 
within the respective study, Stage IIIA or above, showed a lesser response in terms of tpCR compared to 
patients with lower disease stage, which is also supported by the literature.  
Further, the applicant conducted meta-analyses in order to demonstrate that the pCR rates seen in Study 
CT-P6 3.2 align well with the results of the historical studies with different trastuzumab exposures and 
chemotherapy regimens. 
In conclusion, the lower pCR rate noted in the HannaH study is likely due to a greater proportion of 
patients being at Stage III and T4. 
Herceptin  is  authorised  in  the  treatment  of  HER2-positive  MBC,  early  breast  cancer,  and  metastatic 
gastric cancer. The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and the target 
receptor involved is also the same in early breast cancer, metastatic gastric cancer and MBC (i.e., HER2). 
Results  of  the  physico-chemical,  structural,  and  biological  characterisation  studies  together  with  the 
evidence from non-clinical studies and PK studies support extrapolation to the other oncology indications. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint of pCR for study CT-P6 3.2 was met and efficacy data appears to be 
comparable between the treatment arms and supported by secondary efficacy endpoints. The clinical 
efficacy data therefore support biosimilarity. 
Extrapolation to the other approved indications of Herceptin is supported by the efficacy results from the 
clinical trials, in addition to the quality comparability data, including results from functional assays and 
the PK results. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Key safety information is derived from 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy subjects (Studies 
CT-P6 1.4 and CT-P6 1.5) and 1 ongoing Phase 3 study in patients with HER-2 positive early breast cancer 
(EBC) (Study CT-P6 3.2).  
Patient exposure 
Study CT-P6 1.4 
In the supportive healthy volunteer study CT-P6 1.4, among the 70 randomized subjects (35 subjects in 
each treatment group), three subjects withdrew from the study before drug  administration due to an 
adverse event (1 subject and 2 subjects in the CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin groups, respectively). 
Therefore, the Safety Analysis Set includes 34 subjects treated with CT-P6 and 33 subjects treated with 
US-licensed Herceptin. 
Study CT-P6 1.5 
In the pivotal healthy volunteer study CT-P6 1.5, all 70 randomized subjects (35 in each treatment group) 
received the study treatment (35 subjects received a mean dose of 466.54 mg CT-P6 and 35 subjects 
received a mean dose of 459.90 mg US-licensed Herceptin). No dosing interruptions or discontinuations 
were  reported  for  any  subject.  To  avoid  infusion-related  reactions,  premedication  with  oral 
acetaminophen (650 mg) was administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to the infusion of CT-P6 or US-licensed 
Herceptin in this study.

Study CT-P6 3.2 
The patient exposure for the pivotal therapeutic similarity study in patients with HER-2 positive EBC is as 
follows as of cut-off date 28 February 2017: 
Table 29: 
Exposure of patients in Study CT-P6 3.2 
Adverse events 
Safety summary Study CT-P6 1.4 
In the CT-P6 group, 28 (82.35%) subjects experienced a total of 47 AEs, compared to 28 (84.85%) 
subjects experiencing 55 AEs in the US-licensed Herceptin groups. Most were mild to moderate. 
The proportion of subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE was similar between both treatment groups. 
The TEAEs most frequently reported were infusion related reactions. It should be noted that patients were 
not premedicated.  The number of infusion reactions was 15 [44.12%] subjects in the CT-P6 group and 14 
[42.42%] subjects in the US-licensed Herceptin group. 
No subjects in the CT-P6 treatment group experienced any event of cardiotoxicity while 1 (3.0%) subject 
in the Herceptin treatment group experienced a moderate event of ejection fraction decreased. This

During the Post-treatment follow-up Period in which patients were not treated with the study drug, TEAEs 
were collected after EOT date (or the last dose date +30 days unless patients have EOT visit). According 
to Study CT-P6 3.2 protocol, TEAEs were assessed until up to 30 days from the last dose of study drug and 
afterward, only related AEs and cardiac AEs were reported until the end of the study. Eight patients in the 
CT-P6 treatment group and 2 patients in the Herceptin treatment group experienced at least 1 TEAE 
during the Post-treatment Follow-up Period.  
Both ejection fraction decreased and neutropenia were reported for 2 patients each in the CT-P6 
treatment group and other TEAEs (Adams-Stokes syndrome, abdominal pain, breast adenoma, 
leukopenia, left ventricular hypertrophy, nasopharyngitis, palpitations and ventricular extrasystoles) 
were reported for no more than 1 patient in each treatment group.

Adverse events of special interest 
Cardiac adverse events: 
SAE that is related to heart failure is defined as follows: symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
such as decreased LVEF. 
In the Neoadjuvant Period of Study CT-P6 3.2 with EBC patients, 5 (1.8%) patients in the CT-P6 
treatment group and 2 (0.7%) patients in the Herceptin treatment group had at least 1 TEAE due to heart 
failure. Of those, 4 (1.5%) patients and 2 (0.7%) patients had at least 1 study drug-related TEAE due to 
heart failure in the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups, respectively. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 
5 events in either group. No patients with fatal outcome were reported. 
All cases of individual cases of heart failure and LVEF decline were asymptomatic and non-serious events.  
Four of 5 patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 1 of 2 patients in the Herceptin treatment group 
reported cases resulted in recovery. Similarly, 4 of 5 patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 1 of 2 
patients in the Herceptin treatment group did not necessitate the treatment withdrawal because the LVEF 
decline was modest, documented only at a single time point and was not confirmed at subsequent 
re-evaluation. During the Adjuvant Period, 6 (2.2%) patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 4 (1.4%) 
patients in the Herceptin treatment group had at least 1 TEAE due to heart failure. Overall during the 
study the incidences were similar and the majority of cases were Grade 1-2 and non-serious.  
The overall number of patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE due to vascular disorders was similar 
between the 2 treatment groups with a similar proportion for severe events during the study including the 
Adjuvant and Overall Follow-up Periods.  There was a slight trend towards higher hypertension related 
and unrelated TEAEs due to Vascular Disorders with CT-P6 during the Neoadjuvant Period, as TEAEs due 
to hypertension were reported for 16 (5.9%) patients in the CT-P6 group and 4 (1.4%) patients in the 
Herceptin group. During the Adjuvant Period, TEAEs due to hypertension were less frequently reported for 
patients in the CT-P6 group compared to the Herceptin group (3 patients, i.e.1.1%, vs. 7 patients, i.e., 
2.5%). Thus there is no consistent trend in the rate of AEs due to hypertension in the two treatment 
groups. 
Most patients with at least 1 TEAE due to hypertension had relevant medical history and baseline 
characteristics predisposing to hypertension, including higher BMI, age and baseline blood pressure. 
There were no clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups with respect to these factors. 
Also, no difference was observed between the groups regarding treatment and duration of hypertension. 
Taken together, no clinically relevant differences between the groups were observed in the rate or the 
nature of hypertension reported as an AE. 
Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction: 
In clinical studies with CT-P6, cardiac ejection fraction was assessed by ECHO (or MUGA scan in Study 
CT-P6 3.2 only) at pre-defined time points. Mean LVEF values at baseline were 66.05% and 65.93% for 
the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups respectively. Mean changes from baseline in LVEF value were 
- 1.11% and - 0.78% at Cycle 4 and - 2.66 and - 2.13 at EOT1 in the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment 
groups, respectively. For the overall worst value (post baseline worst value), there were no notable 
differences between the 2 treatment groups. The median (range) for the post-baseline worst value were 
62.00% (38.0% - 76.0%) and 62.75% (37.0% - 77.0%) in the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups, 
respectively.  
One patient in each treatment group was withdrawn from the treatment in concordance with the 
protocol-specified criteria for withdrawal. Thus, the number of patients with significant LVEF decrease 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 77/91 
 
 
 
that met the protocol-defined criteria for withdrawal from treatment was the same in the 2 treatment 
groups. 
The data on decreased ejection fraction and heart failure was updated and revealed that the mean LVEF 
values and the number of patients with significant decrease in ejection fraction (9 patients in the CT-P6 
group and 7 patients in the Herceptin group) were similar between the treatment groups during the 
overall study. Three patients in each treatment group were withdrawn due to significant LVEF decrease. 
Among these patients, one in the Herceptin group had symptomatic LVEF decrease during the adjuvant 
period that was reported as a SAE. 
TEAEs due to heart failure were reported for the above mentioned 16 patients and for one additional 
patient in the CT-P6 group (who had no significant LVEF decrease). Overall, the incidences were similar 
and the majority of cases were Grade 1-2 and non-serious (see above). 
The Applicant has further looked at Cmax values in three subgroups based on overall worst value for LVEF 
in the Neoadjuvant Period, as PK samples were collected during this period only. There was no correlation 
of LVEF and higher Cmax throughout the 8 treatment cycles. 
Overall, cardiac safety of CT-P6 and Herceptin appears similar based on the data available. 
Infusion related reactions: 
Treatment-emergent AEs due to IRRs were reported for 31 (11.4%) patients and 29 (10.4%) patients in 
the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups, respectively.  
The signs and symptoms most frequently reported for patients in the CT-P6 treatment group were related 
to cardiovascular (hypertension: 10 [3.7%] patients, Hypotension: 1 [0.4%] patient, palpitation: 1 
[0.4%] patient, and tachycardia: 4 [1.5%] patients) and general disorders and administration site 
conditions (chest discomfort: 2 [0.7%] patients, chest pain: 1 [0.4%] patient, chills: 7 [2.6%] patients, 
feeling hot: 1 [0.4%] patient, injection site pain: 1 [0.4%] patient). 
The signs and symptoms most frequently reported for patients in the Herceptin treatment group were 
related to cardiovascular (hypertension: 6 [2.2%] patients, Hypotension: 2 [0.7%] patients, and 
tachycardia: 1 [0.4%] patient) and skin and/or mucosal (angioedema: 1 [0.4%] patient, flushing: 8 
[2.9%] patients, rash: 1 [0.4%] patient, and swollen lips: 3 [1.1%] patients). 
Haematotoxicity 
During the Overall Period, 143 (52.8%) patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 163 (58.6%) patients 
in the Herceptin treatment group experienced at least 1 TEAE due to haematotoxicity. Of these, 26 
(9.6%) patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 51 (18.3%) patients in the Herceptin treatment group 
experienced at least 1 study drug-related TEAE due to haematotoxicity. Most of the patients (133/143 
patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 143/163 patients in the Herceptin treatment group) recovered. 
TEAE due to haematotoxicity leading to the treatment discontinuation was reported for 1 (0.4%) patient 
in the CT-P6 treatment group. 
Oligohydramnios 
There is no patient who had a pregnancy to term, and therefore no oligohydramnios was recorded 
throughout the Study CT-P6 3.2 
Pulmonary Disorders 
During the Overall Period, 2 (0.7%) patients in each treatment groups experienced a TEAE due to 
pulmonary disorders. All events were study drug-unrelated, non-serious and did not lead to treatment 
discontinuation from the study drug. 
Assessment report

Infections 
During the Overall Period, 78 (28.8%) patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 65 (23.4%) patients in 
the Herceptin treatment group experienced at least 1 TEAE due to infection. Of these, 13 patients in each 
treatment group experienced at least 1 study drug-related TEAE due to infection. Most of the patients 
(73/78 patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 60/65 patients in the Herceptin treatment group) 
recovered. TEAEs due to infection leading to the treatment discontinuation were reported for 2 (0.7%) 
patients in the Herceptin treatment group. 
Vital signs and Hypersensitivity monitoring 
The mean changes from baseline in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, body 
temperature and respiratory rate) were small and there were no apparent differences between the 
treatment groups during the Adjuvant Period. The most commonly reported abnormal vital sign result 
from the start of the study drug infusion occurring during hypersensitivity monitoring was high 
respiratory rate in up to 13.3% of patients).

Death 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to death were reported for 2 patients in each treatment, respectively.  
-  One patient who was treated with Neoadjuvant Period Cycle 3 of CT-P6 in combination with 
docetaxel, experienced dyspnoea and died on the same day. Pulmonary embolism could not be 
ruled out from the cause of sudden death due to medical history of deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary hypertension. The LVEF was 65% and ECG was normal at screening period and the 
case was considered unrelated to study drug by investigator 
-  One patient who was treated with Neoadjuvant Period Cycle 8 of CT-P6 in combination with FEC; 
was considered to be unrelated to study treatment by the investigator and the exact cause of 
death is unknown, potential role of metastases in fatal outcome cannot be completely ruled out. 
-  One patient who was treated with Neoadjuvant Period Cycle 1 of Herceptin in combination with 
docetaxel experienced an acute myocardial infarction and died on the next day.  This is the only 
reported death considered to be possibly related to study drug was acute myocardial infarction (1 
[0.4%] patient in the Herceptin treatment group). The LVEF was 70% and BP was 120/80 mmHg 
at screening. However, it is likely that background severe hypertension and underlying ischemic 
heart disease contributed to an acute coronary event 
-  One patient in the Herceptin treatment group who was treated with Adjuvant Period Cycle 9 
treatment on 02 September 2016 experienced an aortic dissection on 23 September 2016, and 
died on the next day (Adjuvant Period Cycle 9 Day 23). The patient had ongoing medical histories 
of hypertension, uterine leiomyoma, and ovarian cyst, however, no concomitant medication was 
reported regarding treatment for hypertension. LVEF value was assessed as 71.6% at screening, 
and no significant LVEF decrease was reported until Adjuvant Period cycle 9.  According to the 
autopsy report, the cause of death was confirmed as dissection of ascending aorta, and the 
investigator considered this event as unrelated to the study drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 80/91 
 
 
 
 
 
During the Post-treatment Follow-up Period, 5 deaths (due to progressive disease) in the CT-P6 
treatment group and 3 deaths (2 deaths due to progressive disease and 1 death with unknown reason) in 
the Herceptin treatment group were reported.  
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
During Overall Period, 11 (4.1%) patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 13 (4.7%) patients in the 
Herceptin treatment group experienced a TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation was infusion related reaction (5 [1.8%] 
patients and 2 [0.7%] patients, respectively). 
Immunological events 
One of the secondary objectives of Study CT-P6 3.2 was to assess the immunogenicity of CT-P6 in 
comparison to Herceptin. Immunogenicity testing findings were assessed in the safety analysis set 
defined as all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose (fully or partial) of either CT-P6 or 
Herceptin. 
In Study CT-P6 3.2, blood samples for immunogenicity assessments of the Neoadjuvant Period (ADA and 
NAb) were obtained at baseline, after Cycle 4 and at EOT1. Blood samples for immunogenicity 
assessments of the Adjuvant Period were collected at Cycle 1, after Cycles 3 and 6, and at EOT2. In the 
Post-treatment Follow-up Period, immunogenicity was assessed every 3 months up to 1 year (maximum 
4 times). 
For the Neoadjuvant Period, a total of 4 patients in the CT-P6 treatment group and 8 patients in the 
Herceptin treatment group were ADA positive at pre-dose, however, NAb results were all negative for 
these patients. During the Adjuvant Period and Post-treatment Follow-up Period as of cut-off date (28 
February 2017), none of the patients were ADA positive. It is noteworthy that Post-treatment Follow-up 
1 was approximately 3 months after the last dose of study treatment in the Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant 
Periods, thus drug interference is not expected.  
Laboratory findings 
Most of laboratory parameters had no NCI CTCAE grade or were mild or moderate for each laboratory 
parameter and time point. There was no notable difference between the 2 treatment groups for patients 
with NCI CTCAE grade 3 or higher hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Key safety information is derived from 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy subjects (Studies 
CT-P6 1.4 and CT-P6 1.5) and 1 ongoing Phase 3 study in patients with early breast cancer (EBC) (Study 
CT-P6 3.2).  
The safety findings of Study CT-P6 1.4 and CT-P6 1.5 may be viewed as similar between both arms.   
The main safety data is derived from study CT-P6 3.2 in patients with EBC/LABC that may be viewed as 
mature with a median follow up of 19.3 months in the CT-P6 treatment group and 19.6 months in the 
Herceptin treatment group. 
The exposure of study treatment CT-P6 3.2 was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. The 
relative dose intensity of study drug was similar, indicating good tolerability of CT-P6 and Herceptin. 
The overall safety profile in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of Herceptin with 
chemotherapy regimen used in the Neoadjuvant Period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 81/91 
 
 
 
There were no new or unexpected safety findings observed in this study. 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE was similar between the 2 treatment groups 
While the emergence of TEAEs in the Neoadjuvant Period can be augmented by the effects of background 
chemotherapy regimens,docetaxel, fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, the study drug was 
administered in the absence of concomitant chemotherapy and less events were recorded in the Adjuvant 
Period. 
More than 90% of TEAEs in both treatment groups were of grade 1 or 2 in intensity. 
Overall, the incidence of the most frequently reported TEAEs was similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
The proportions of patients who experienced TEAEs considered to be related to the study drug were 
similar between the 2 treatment groups.  
Treatment-emergent AEs considered related to study drug in the CT-P6 or Herceptin treatment groups 
were largely similar between treatment arms (or less in CT-P6 arm), and therefore currently of no 
concern. It is noteworthy that there are more than twice as many  patients with blood and lymphatic 
system disorders considered related to study drug  (5.5% versus 13.7% for CT-P6 and Herceptin, 
respectively) and liver enzyme elevations (2.2% versus 6.8% for CT-P6 and Herceptin, respectively) in 
the Herceptin arm.  
The number of patients who experienced severe (Grade ≥3) TEAEs was similar between the 2 treatment 
groups and the distribution of patients was comparable across all SOCs. 
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TESAE was similar between 2 treatment groups. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs related to study drug reported were similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
Overall the incidence and severity of TEAEs of special interest was comparable across the treatment 
groups.  
There were 3 deaths reported during the Neoadjuvant Period and one in the adjuvant period. 
Two cases of death were reported in the CT-P6 treatment group. One was sudden death with no causal 
relationship to study drug and the potential role of metastases in fatal outcome cannot be completely 
ruled out. The other was considered to be unrelated to study drug by the investigator. One death case 
with acute myocardial infarction was occurred in the Herceptin treatment group.  
The proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAEs leading to permanent study drug 
discontinuation was similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
With regards to immunogenicity of CT-P6, it appears low and comparable to that of Herceptin, with both 
ADA methods used. Only samples from the Neoadjuvant Period have been tested with the new ADA 
method. The old assay is less drug tolerant and therefore the negative ADA samples of the treatment-free 
follow-up period are particularly relevant. As there is no clinical signal of increased immunogenicity, the 
data available are considered sufficient to exclude clinically relevant immunogenicity of CT-P6. 
From the safety database of trastuzumab all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and 
post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics of Herzuma which follows 
the one of Herceptin. Furthermore, the RMP of Herzuma adequately addresses the safety concerns of 
trastuzumab, in line with Herceptin. 
The applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications for the biosimilar Herzuma as granted for 
Herceptin for intravenous administration in the EU. Herzuma showed similarity to Herceptin in terms of 
safety based on available data up to 20 months in EBC patients. The results are comparable to data 
published for the reference product. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between 
Herzuma and Herceptin in key trastuzumab adverse events that would preclude extrapolation of safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/44005/2018  
Page 82/91 
 
 
 
outcomes obtained in the HER2-positive MBC indication. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of 
trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and results of the physico-chemical, structural, and 
biological characterization studies, as well as PK data support similarity between Herzuma and Herceptin. 
Therefore, extrapolation from safety perspective is considered acceptable. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  main  data  relevant  for  comparability  exercise  in  terms  of  safety  comes  from  study  CT-P6  3.2  in 
patients with HER-2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). The overall safety profile as reflected by the most 
frequently reported TEAEs, severity of the TEAEs and number reported as related, appears broadly similar 
between Herzuma and Herceptin and in line with those expected on the basis of the EU Herceptin SmPC. 
The immunogenicity profiles were also comparable.  
To conclude, the available safety data support biosimilarity between Herzuma and Herceptin and since no 
clinically  relevant  differences  in  safety  were  observed  in  EBC  between  Herzuma  and  Herceptin,  no 
differences in the safety of Herzuma is expected in the MBC and MGC indication and hence, extrapolation 
to other indications of the reference product is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indications, dosage and route of administration proposed for CT-P6 are identical to those 
approved for Herceptin for IV use in HER2 positive; metastatic breast cancer, early breast cancer and 
metastatic gastric cancer.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Overall, the clinical development programme for CT-P6 includes 2 completed Phase 1 clinical studies in 
healthy subjects (Studies CT-P6 1.5 and CT-P6 1.4) and 1 ongoing Phase 3 study in patients with early 
breast cancer (EBC) (Study CT-P6 3.2) and safety data is reported for all three studies. 
Studies CT-P6 1.5 and CT-P6 1.4 were designed to demonstrate the similarity between CT-P6 and 
Herceptin with respect to the Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile but also in terms of comparative safety and 
tolerability. 
Study CT-P6 3.2 was designed to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence in terms of pathological 
complete response (pCR) assessed during the surgery after the Neoadjuvant Period (24 weeks [8 cycles]) 
and to collect other comparative efficacy, PK/ Pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and immunogenicity data 
between CT-P6 and Herceptin in patients.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
From a quality perspective, CT-P6 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the 
innovator product Herceptin (trastuzumab). Overall the data indicate that CT-P6 can be considered 
biosimilar to Herceptin. 
The overall the non-clinical data on PD/PK and toxicology indicate that CT-P6 was comparable to the 
reference product Herceptin. 
In terms of clinical pharmacokinetics, in trials, CT-P6 1.4 and 1.5 the comparison of the presented single 
dose PK results (AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and Cmax) and also of secondary PK  endpoints (Tmax, Vz, λz, t1/2, CL)  
of CT-P6 versus US Herceptin  in study CT-P6 1.4 and CT-P6 1.5 in healthy volunteers indicate 
biosimilarity. Likewise, the presented PK data (C troughs for cycle 1-8) in EBC patients (study CT-P6 3.2) 
is similar between the CT-P6 and Herceptin treatment groups.

Based on the efficacy results of the pivotal phase III clinical study CT-P6 3.2 in patients with HER2 positive 
EBC/LABC, The primary endpoint of the study was met. The number of responders in the CT-P6 and 
Herceptin treatment groups were 46.8% patients and 50.4% patients, respectively, leading to a minor 
difference of – 3.6% for CT-P6 treated patients. The 95% CI for the estimate of treatment difference was 
- 12.38%, 5.16% which is entirely contained within the equivalence range of -15% to 15% thus 
supporting biosimilarity.  
The secondary endpoint pCR of breast and axillary nodes with absence of DCIS is comparable between the 
two arms with 39.9% CT-P6 patients and 41.4% Herceptin patients, respectively. The 95% CI for the 
estimate of treatment difference is (-10.22%, 7.31%) The results are confirmed in the ITT analysis.  
Further, the secondary endpoint data for pCRB seem comparable between the two treatment arms at 
4.8% versus 4.7%, respectively and the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response during 
the neoadjuvant period appeared the same in the two arms with CT-P6 (84.3%) and Herceptin (84.0%) 
patients and is in accordance with the literature thus supporting similarity 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties concerning the favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data (data cut off: 28 February  2017) may be viewed as mature since 90% of patients 
completed the adjuvant period and patients have been followed up for a median duration of 19.3 months 
for CT-P6 and 19.6 months for the Herceptin treatment group. The type and incidence of ADRs of CT-P6 
and Herceptin were broadly comparable and in line with those described in the Herceptin SmPC. No 
increased immunogenicity was observed for CT-P6. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no uncertainties concerning the unfavourable effects. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Balance of benefits and risks 
CT-P6 has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product to the innovator product Herceptin 
(trastuzumab). The overall non-clinical data has shown comparability of CT-P6 to Herceptin in terms of 
PD/PK and toxicology. Pharmacology studies have shown similarly where the presented single and 
multiple dose PK results of CT-P6 versus US Herceptin are comparable. The primary clinical efficacy 
endpoint for the phase III trial CT-P6 3.2 was met with the proportion of patients achieving pCR was 
46.8% (95%CI 40.4%, 53.2%) for CT-P6 and 50.4% (95%CI 44.1. 56.7%) for the Herceptin arm and the 
confidence limits of the 95% CI of the difference in the proportions of responders were entirely bounded 
by the interval (-0.15 – 0.15), demonstrating similarity in terms of efficacy between the two products. 
The safety database was mature with most safety data derived from study CT-P6 3.2 and a median follow 
up of 19.3 months in the CT-P6 treatment group and 19.6 months in the Herceptin treatment group. No 
new signals were identified and the safety data was supportive of biosimilarity. 
The totality of the data on the comparability exercise indicate that CT-P6 can be considered a biosimilar 
of Herceptin.

3.6.2.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Herceptin is authorised in patients with HER2-positive MBC, early breast cancer, and metastatic gastric 
cancer. The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is the same in all three indications and the target 
receptor involved is also the same in early breast cancer, metastatic gastric cancer and MBC (i.e., HER2). 
The dosage is also similar for all 3 indications, and trastuzumab is administered by the same route in all 
indications. Hence, extrapolation in terms of efficacy is supported by the results of the physico-chemical, 
structural and biological characterization data, results from comparative preclinical studies (in vitro 
functional tests) together with PK comparability data. Extrapolation is also considered acceptable from a 
safety perspective since no difference in the safety risks have been identified. Overall, available data 
support the extrapolation to the other indications of the reference product. 
The applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications for the biosimilar Herzuma as granted for 
Herceptin for intravenous administration in the EU. Considering Herceptin is also marketed for 
subcutaneous administration, a risk of medication error was identified as an important potential risk. 
Adequate risk minimisation measures to avoid the potential route of administration error have been 
included in the SmPC section 4.2 and in the RMP.

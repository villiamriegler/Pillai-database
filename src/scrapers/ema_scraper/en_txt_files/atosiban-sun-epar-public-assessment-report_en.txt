2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Atosiban SUN, 6.75 mg/0.9 ml solution for injection and 37.5 mg /5 ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion is a generic medicinal product of Tractocile, which has been authorised in the EU since 20 
January 2000. 
The active substance of Atosiban SUN is atosiban, a synthetic peptide ([Mpa1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Thr4,Orn8]-
oxytocin) which is a competitive antagonist of human oxytocin at receptor level. In human pre-term 
labour, atosiban at the recommended dosage antagonises uterine contractions and induces uterine 
quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being 
significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence (≤ 4 contractions/hour) 
for 12 hours. 
The safety and efficacy profile of atosiban has been demonstrated in several clinical trials. In addition, 
there is extensive post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this 
product. Since this application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product 
Tractocile, no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety 
have been conducted. 
Atosiban SUN is administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active 
substance as the currently approved product; therefore, a bioequivalence study versus the reference 
product Tractocile was not required according to the applicable guideline.  
The indication proposed for Atosiban SUN is the same as authorized for the reference medicinal 
product: to delay imminent pre-term birth in pregnant adult women with: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
regular uterine contractions of at least 30 seconds duration at a rate of ≥ 4 per 30 minutes 
a cervical dilation of 1 to 3 cm (0-3 for nulliparas) and effacement of ≥ 50% 
a gestational age from 24 until 33 completed weeks 
a normal foetal heart rate 
The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

2.2.   Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection and concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 6.75 mg/0.9 ml and 37.5 mg/5ml, respectively of atosiban (as acetate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol, hydrochloric acid and water for injections for both pharmaceutical 
forms. 
The product is available in glass vial (type I) with bromobutyl flange rubber stopper and sealed with 
flip top aluminium seal. 
2.2.2.   Active substance 
The chemical name of atosiban acetate  is L-Glycinamide; cyclic(1―6)-disulfide, 3-
mercaptopropionamide-D-tyrosyl(ethyl)-L-isoleucyl-L-threonyl-L-asparaginyl-L-cysteinyl-L-prolyl-L-
ornithyl (available as acetate salt) and has the following structure: 
Atosiban acetate is a white or off-white powder, hygroscopic and soluble in water. Atosiban is a multi-
chiral deca-peptide. The chiral centres are denoted in the structure of Atosiban. The chiral attribute of 
Atosiban is assessed by a specific optical rotation test. The specific optical rotation value ranges 
between -55° and -45°.  Polymorphism has not been observed for atosiban. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture 
Atosiban acetate is synthesised by one manufacturing site. 
The Solid phase peptide synthesis of atosiban involves coupling of the amino acid components in 
sequential manner.The first amino acid is selectively bound to a polymer resin. The amino group is 
then selectively de-blocked and condensed with the next amino acid. This completed one cycle is then 
repeated sequentially for coupling of remaining 8 protected amino acids. The protected atosiban is 
cleaved and de-protected to obtain crude active substance. This crude product is finally purified and 
Atosiban SUN  
EMA/476499/2013  
Page 6/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the pure product obtained from HPLC purification is desalted and freeze dried to yield pure atosiban 
acetate. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, solubility, identification (molecular 
weight, UPLC), water content, related substances (UPLC), amino acids, assay (UPLC), peptide content, 
residual solvents, specific optical rotation, content of acetic acid (GC), clarity, colour index, content of 
trifluoroacetic acid (IC), bacterial endotoxins, bioburden test, total aerobic microbial count, total 
combined moulds and yeasts count.   The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the 
active substance and were found to be adequate to control the quality of the active substance.  
Batch analysis data of three production batches of active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 3 production batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in a 
container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up 24 (1 batch) and 18 (2 
batches) months under long term conditions at -20 ± 5°C and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 5°C ± 3°C according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, clarity, colour index, water content , 
specific optical rotation, content of dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, related substances, 
content of acetic acid, and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating.The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed 
supplier(s) is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed 
container.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a finished product comparable to the 
reference medicinal product Tractocile 7.5mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion and Tractocile 
7.5mg/ml solution for injection. The composition of Atosiban SUN concentrate and solution for injection 
is identical to the reference product with respect to both the active substance and the excipients. The 
relevant attributes (physicochemical characteristics and compatibility of the active substance with the 
excipients) of the drug substance that can influence the performance of the drug product were taken 
into consideration during development. 
The manufacturing process comprises of bulk manufacturing in a vessel, aseptic filtration and filling. 
The choice of sterilisation method together with other critical process parameters was justified. The 
concentrate for solution for infusion was tested for compatibility with the following solutions as stated 
in the SmPC: 0.9%w/v NaCl, Ringer’s lactate solution, and 5%w/v glucose solution. 
Atosiban SUN  
EMA/476499/2013

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging proposed is Atosiban Sun is packed in tubular glass vial (type I) with 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and sealed with flip top aluminium seal. Compatibility with the primary 
packaging material chosen is shown and a photo stability study has been presented.  An extractables 
study was also performed on the rubber stoppers and there are no concerns. Container closure 
integrity has been shown by means of sterility testing and a microbial challenge test. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process comprises of bulk manufacturing in a vessel, aseptic filtration and filling. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for both pharmaceutical forms.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications for both pharmaceurical forms include appropriate tests for 
description, identification (UPLC, UV), identification for mannitol, pH, bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur), 
particulate contamination, sterility (Ph Eur), extractable volume (Ph Eur), volume variation, % 
transmittance at 650 nm, absorbance at 420 nm, related substance (UPLC),  assay of atosiban (UPLC), 
assay of mannitol (HPLC), cytotoxicity – in vitro biological reactivity test, and uniformity of dosage (Ph 
Eur). 
Batch analysis results in six batches (three for each pharmaceutical form) of commercial scale confirm 
consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 production batches per pharmaceutical form of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for 12 months at 2ºC - 8ºC (upright and inverted)  and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 25 ºC ±  2ºC / 60% ± 5% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of Atosiban SUN are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. 
Samples were tested for the following tests: description, pH, absorbance at 420 nm, % transmittance 
at 650 nm, related substance and assay of atosiban. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable.

introduction of Atosiban SUN manufactured by SUN Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd is considered 
unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all atosiban containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to 
be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In accordance with Article 10(1) of European Directive 2001/83/EC appropriate data is provided to 
support the claim that the proposed product is essentially similar to the originator with respect to both 
the solution for injection and the concentrate for solution of infusion. The qualitative composition is 
identical with that of the originator and the applicant’s proposed SmPC is compliant with the reference 
product with no novel claims or dose recommendations. The   impurity profile has been discussed and 
was considered acceptable. An adequate non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 December 2019 an application for a group of 
variations. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variations requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
B.I.b.1.c  
B.I.b.1.c - Change in the specification parameters and/or 
Type IA  None 
limits of an AS, starting material/intermediate/reagent - 
Addition of a new specification parameter to the 
specification with its corresponding test method 
B.I.a.2.c  
B.I.a.2.c - Changes in the manufacturing process of the 
Type II 
None 
AS - The change refers to a [-] substance in the 
manufacture of a biological/immunological substance 
which may have a significant impact on the medicinal 
product and is not related to a protocol 
B.I.b.2.b  
B.I.b.2.b - Change in test procedure for AS or starting 
Type IA  None 
material/reagent/intermediate - Deletion of a test 
procedure for the AS or a starting 
material/reagent/intermediate, if an alternative test 
procedure is already authorised 
The requested group of variations proposed no amendments to the Product Information. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Full activation of T-cells requires two signals provided by the antigen presenting cells (APCs). One of 
the signals occurs with the interaction between CD28 on the T-cells and B7-1 and B7-2 (CD80 and 
CD86, respectively) on the antigen presenting cells (APCs). This specific interaction initiates a signal 
transduction mechanism, which include the production of cytokine IL-2, T cell activation and 
proliferation. Belatacept selectively blocks full activation (IL-2 production) of T-lymphocytes by binding 
specifically to B7-1 and B7 2 on the APC and inhibiting the co-stimulatory pathway.  
The MAH has developed a new manufacturing process (going from “process C” to “process E [PPQ]”). 
The MAH has shown in vitro that the CD80 and CD86 binding, as well as IL-2 inhibition, does not differ 
at the same concentrations of process C and process E product. 
The MAH included a biocomparability study in this variation. In this single dose biocomparability study, 
representative batches of Process C and Process E has not been shown to be comparable in PK 
(AUCinf) as the elimination of belatacept produced by Process E appears faster. Given the observed 
difference in half life, it is expected that Cmin will in average be 30 % lower if a patient is administered 
belatacept from Process E compared to belatacept from Process C when belatacept is used according to 
the posology given in the approved SmPC. The lower Cmin in the maintenance phase could potentially 
lead to loss of efficacy. 
In vitro quality data shows that belatacept binding to CD80/CD86 is similar for process C and Process 
E, and the IL-2 inhibition is similar at similar concentrations. Thus, with a similar PK/PD relationship for 
process C and process E belatacept, a similar Cmin in the maintenance phase for the new process E is 
desired to ensure adequate receptor occupancy and thus maintain similar efficacy as process C. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/708312/2021

applicant has simulated different dose levels for process E and recommended a dose level of 6 mg/kg 
for the maintenance phase. The Geometric mean ratio for Cmin is 0.832, 1,02 for AUC and 1,22 for 
Cmax.  The process E Cmin, AUC and Cmax point estimates are considered similar (within 0,8-1,25) to 
the process C exposure and the variability (simulated 5th and 95th percentiles of exposure) are 
considered fairly similar. The proposed dose level is therefore considered satisfactory both from a 
efficacy and a safety standpoint. The 6 mg/kg dose level is supported, and the PI is updated 
accordingly. 
No dose adjustment is proposed for the induction phase. Increasing the dose in the induction phase 
would potentially increase safety issues, including the risk and of infection and within the induction 
therapeutic window the exposure difference between C and E are not of concern with regards to 
efficacy. 
The proposed maintenance posology change (from 5 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg) introduces a potential risk of 
medication error, due to inaccurate weight-based dosing based on which process material is 
administered. In theory, Process C and Process E drug products could both be on the EU market until 
Process C drug product is consumed, but on average Process C finished product in the distribution 
channels should be depleted within 1 to 2 months. Due to this limited “at risk period” and as 
belatacept is prepared and administered by a licensed healthcare professional with pharmacy 
oversight, the potential risk of medication error is anticipated to be low with the planned risk 
mitigating measures as described below.  
The MAH has presented an updated version of the RMP (version 19.0, final sign off 28-Jul-2021) to 
align with changes to the SmPC as part of the Process E manufacturing change. It is agreed with the 
MAH that the risk of medication errors in transitioning from Process C and Process E will be limited in 
time. Notwithstanding, it is considered that this risk should temporarily be amended in the Summary 
of safety concerns to an Important potential risk. The MAH has also presented a draft DHPC and 
communication plan. An updated DHPC will be provided in the upcoming quality and RMP variation, 
planned for submission in January 2022. In summary, the RMP update will include the new 
maintenance dose, the new Important potential risk and the updated DHPC listed as an additional risk 
minimisation measure.  
A comprehensive summary of events should be also provided in the next PSUR. 
Information on the new maintenance dose will be applied to the outer package during the transition 
from Process C to Process E. e.g., 6 months by a printed warning on the front panel of the outer 
package. Furthermore, the MAH accepted to apply a new colour to the outer package when introducing 
the Process E drug product on the market to ensure it is easily discernible from the Process C drug 
product. The MAH will submit revised MUs and specimen considering using another colour than the 
blueish green (PMS 565), as a red text on this background may be difficult to read for persons with 
colour blindness. Upon request, the MAH responded that warning cannot be added to the vial label due 
to readability issues. However, the MAH proposed that the colour of the Process E drug product vial 
label matches the colour of the outer package to further differentiate Process E drug product from 
Process C drug product. This is agreed.  
Overall, the B/R for belatacept process E with the updated posology of the maintenance phase is 
considered positive.

Update of the SmPC section 4.2, 5.2 and 6.6 to reflect new maintenance dose and revised PK data 
following the change in manufacturing process. Labelling and Package leaflet are updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the MAH introduced minor editorial changes throughout the PI. 
 is recommended for approval. 
This variation leads to the amendments of the SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

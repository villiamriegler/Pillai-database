1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Kite Pharma EU B.V. submitted on 29 July 2017 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for YESCARTA, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
YESCARTA was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1393 on 16 December 2014 in the 
following condition: Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) 
YESCARTA was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/ 3/15/1553 on 09 October 2015 in the 
following condition: Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) 
YESCARTA was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1579 on 11 November 2015 in the 
following condition: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) 
Yescarta was granted eligibility to PRIME on 26 May 2016 in the following indication: Treatment of adult 
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have not responded to their prior therapy, or have 
had disease progression after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
•  DLBCL is a chronically debilitating and life-threatening condition. Refractory/relapsed DLBCL is a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality with a median survival of around 6 months and new treatment options 
would be welcomed. 
•  Although limited, the available nonclinical data supported the pharmacological rationale.  
• 
From a clinical perspective, limited but promising results have been provided with 5 responders out of 7 
patients at Month 1 in the ZUMA-1 study and 63% ORR in patients with DLBCL or PMBCL in the NCI 
study. 
•  Despite many uncertainties, KTE-C19 (Yescarta) could bring a major therapeutic advantage over existing 
therapies and consequently be of major public health interest. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
YESCARTA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma 
(TFL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Clinical experience indicates a significant 
improvement in overall response rate, including durable complete response (no evidence of disease), durable 
partial response, and survival compared to historical outcomes. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Yescarta as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: ema.europa.eu/Find 
medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.

02292.jsp) 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0237/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and on the granting of a partial 
waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0237/2017 not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication.  
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance axicabtagene ciloleucel contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific recommendation on Classification 
The applicant Kite Pharma EU B.V. submitted on 28 April 2015 an application for scientific recommendation 
on Classification to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for YESCARTA, which was designated as an 
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product on 29 June 2015. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, the Rapporteur was appointed by the CHMP. 
A kick-off meeting was subsequently organised with the EMA, Rapporteur, assessor teams and experts from 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 9/127 
  
  
 
 
relevant scientific committees. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development programme and 
regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the following key issues 
through relevant regulatory procedures: Validation of transportation and plans to demonstrate comparability 
between manufacturing processes, EU batch release, discussion related to the risk of insertional 
mutagenesis, regulatory strategy and paediatric investigation plan. 
Protocol assistance 
The applicant received Scientific Advice on the development relevant for the proposed indications from the 
CHMP on 23 July 2015, 17 December 2015, 23 February 2017, and 14 September 2017.  The Scientific 
Advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier: 
•  Manufacturing process, definition of starting material, potency assay for release testing and release 
specification, Replication-Competent Retrovirus testing, testing and release strategy for cell banks, 
sterility testing, comparability following manufacturing changes, stability programme and shelf life, 
process validation for the retroviral vector.   
•  Completeness of the overall non-clinical programme, considering lack of relevant non-clinical models. 
Insertional mutagenesis evaluation. 
•  An open-label, non-comparative phase 1/2 study: Definition of the target population (DLBCL, PMBCL, 
and TFL) and existence of an unmet medical need. Whether a certain improvement in objective 
response rate and duration of response is considered clinically meaningful in comparison to historical 
data. Statistical testing in different cohorts of aggressive B-cell NHL. The proposed safety exposure 
from the clinical programme. 
•  A randomised, open label pivotal phase 3 study with standard of care therapy as comparator: 
Proposed study population (relapsed/refractory DLBCL) and definition. Event Free Survival as primary 
endpoint, its definition, and its appropriateness to show clinical benefit in second-line DLBCL. Key 
secondary endpoints (objective response rate and overall survival). Representativeness for European 
patients of the standard of care treatment in the control group. The modality and frequency of 
imaging and tumour assessment method. Statistical testing plan for primary and key secondary 
endpoints, including interim analysis. Reporting of serious adverse events. Proposed safety 
monitoring plan including replication competent retrovirus, cytokine levels, and immunogenicity.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Non–Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders originating in 
B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells. NK/T-cell lymphomas are very rare. More than 60 
specific NHL subtypes have been identified and assigned names by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
NHL subtypes are categorized by the characteristics of the lymphoma cells, including their appearance, the 
presence of proteins on the surface of the cells and their genetic features. 
Aggressive lymphomas account for about 60 percent of all NHL cases. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
is the most common aggressive NHL subtype. Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is a subtype of 
large B-cell lymphoma  that is putatively derived from a thymic B cell. Its clinical and molecular 
characteristics are distinct from other subtypes of DLBCL and, in fact, closely resemble those of nodular 
sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (NSHL). Transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL) is a morphological 
diagnosis based on the demonstration of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a patient who has been 
diagnosed as having follicular lymphoma, either consecutively or concurrently. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology   
Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute (SEER) 
showed that NHL is the most prevalent haematological malignancy and is the seventh most common new 
cancer among men and women, accounting for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of cancer-related deaths 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 12/127 
  
  
 
(Howlader et al, 2015). For 2016, SEER estimated 72580 new cases of NHL and 20150 deaths due to NHL in 
the United States (Howlader et al, 2015).  
DLBCL is the most common type of NHL, accounting for 30–40% of all cases. DLBCL accounts for 
approximately 31% of all NHLs in Western countries and 37% of B-cell tumours worldwide. The median age 
at presentation is 70 years old; however, it can occur at any age, with a slightly higher incidence in men. The 
incidence rate of DLBCL was 3.44/100000 in the European Union (EU) in 2014 (RARECARENet 2017). The 
probability of having DLBCL increases with age, from 0.13% and 0.09% before the age of 29 to 1.77% and 
1.4% after the age of 70 in men and women, respectively. For the vast majority of patients, the aetiology of 
DLBCL is unknown. Factors thought to potentially confer increased risk include immunosuppression (including 
AIDS, and iatrogenic aetiologies in the setting of transplantation or autoimmune diseases), ultraviolet 
radiation, pesticides, hair dyes, and diet. A subset of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, including immunoblastic 
and primary CNS disease is highly associated with the EBV virus, although unlike certain indolent histologies, 
the concept of antigen-driven lymphomagenesis is less developed in DLBCL.PMBCL constitutes approximately 
2 % to 4 % of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (around 6 % of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). This 
disease affects mainly young adults (median age of 35), predominantly women (female/male ratio 1.7-2/1). 
There are also cases of PMBCL among children and adolescents. No risk factors for this type of lymphoma 
have been identified. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Initially, the classification of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was based on morphology, but advances in immunology 
and molecular medicine allowed the introduction of a biological classification for these diseases. DLBCL arises 
from mature B-cells at different stages of differentiation. Several gene mutations promote changes in B-cells, 
changing the gene expression and promoting a neoplastic transformation. During B lymphocyte ontogeny, 
after leaving the bone marrow, those cells travel to secondary lymphoid tissues where they will find their 
respective antigens promoting the development of secondary follicles. An antigen-dependent phase of B-cell 
development occurs at this site. In the germinal center of the secondary follicle, these lymphocytes are 
transformed into centroblasts that have a high rate of proliferation, while frequent and continuous somatic 
mutations of genes of the immunoglobulin variable chain occur, promoting maturation and differentiation into 
centrocytes and subsequently into plasma cells or in memory B-cells. Multiple lesions involving molecular 
pathways of B-cell proliferation and differentiation may result in the activation of oncogenes such as the 
BCL2, BCL6, and MYC genes and the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes such as p53 and INK4, as well 
as other important transcription factors such as OCT-1 and OCT-2. 
The human CD19 antigen is a 95 kd transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin 
superfamily. CD19 is classified as a type I transmembrane protein, with a single transmembrane domain, a 
cytoplasmic C-terminus, and extracellular N-terminus. CD19 is a biomarker for normal and neoplastic B cells, 
as well as follicular dendritic cells. CD19 is critically involved in establishing intrinsic B cell signaling 
thresholds through modulating both B cell receptor-dependent and independent signalling. CD19 functions as 
the dominant signalling component of a multimolecular complex on the surface of mature B cells, alongside 
complement receptor CD21, and the tetraspanin membrane protein CD81 (TAPA-1), as well as CD225. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical manifestations of diffuse large cell lymphomas are variable and depend on the site of disease 
involvement. These tumours have a rapid growth rate and present as masses, causing symptoms when they 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 13/127 
  
  
infiltrate tissues or obstruct organs. Pain in an enlarged lymph node or organ may be noted if the 
lymphomatous mass enlarges rapidly. As with other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large cell 
lymphomas can present with B-symptoms, including fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. 
Generalized pruritus may also be present. 
Other symptoms can include the following: anorexia, pedal oedema (caused by extensive pelvic 
lymphadenopathy), fatigue, discomfort or shortness of breath (caused by mediastinal lymphadenopathy). 
The diagnosis of DLBCL should be carried out in a reference haematopathology laboratory with expertise in 
morphological interpretation and the facilities to carry out the full range of phenotypic and molecular 
investigations. 
A surgical excision biopsy remains the optimal method of diagnosis. This allows assessment of nodal 
architecture and provides adequate material for phenotypic and molecular studies. Ideally, the biopsy should 
be sent unfixed to the laboratory to allow flow cytometric studies to be carried out and high-quality DNA and 
RNA to be extracted.  
DLBCL shows an aggressive behaviour with a median survival of less than 1 year in untreated patients.  
Follicular lymphoma that transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) portend a poor prognosis for 
most patients, with a median overall survival (OS) of 1 to 2 years. 
Outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL are poor. Only 10% of patients with 
relapsed/refractory disease will have long-term survival, and long-term benefit is generally limited to patients 
with chemotherapy-sensitive disease who achieve a response to second line platinum-based therapy and are 
able to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).  Patients with refractory disease, defined as no 
response to last line of therapy or early relapse after ASCT, have low response rates to subsequent therapy 
and short overall survival (OS). Published reports have demonstrated response rates ranging from 0% to 
23%, and in 1 study, median OS was less than 10 months for such patients (Philip et al, 1995; Moskowitz et 
al, 1999; Ardeshna et al, 2005; Seshadri et al, 2008; Hitz et al, 2010; Telio et al, 2012; Matasar et al, 2013).  
Similarly poor outcomes are observed for patients who have relapsed disease, but are ineligible for ASCT for 
a variety of reasons, such as inadequate response to second line therapy, relapse after second or greater line 
of therapy, failure to mobilize stem cells, or presence of comorbidities (Crump et al, 2004; Feugier et al, 
2005; Colosia et al, 2014; Van Den Neste E et al, 2016). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current standard of care for first-line treatment for aggressive B-cell NHL is a regimen of 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) in combination with an anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) such as rituximab (Flowers et al, 2010). Although more effective than 
chemotherapy alone, first-line R-CHOP only results in long term disease remission in < 40% of subjects. 
Thus, patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell DLBCL and PMBCL may comprise 60% or more of 
all subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL. 
Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and PMBCL typically are treated with a rituximab and platinum-
based chemotherapy regimen, followed by ASCT for those who are eligible (Philip et al, 1995; NCCN, 2014; 
Tilly et al, 2015).  However, studies in relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL indicate that only half of patients who 
respond to second-line therapy are able to proceed to ASCT (Philip et al, 1995; Moskowitz et al, 1999; 
Gisselbrecht et al, 2012; Crump et al, 2014). Thus, only a small fraction of patients with relapse/refractory 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 14/127 
  
  
disease benefit from ASCT.  Friedberg and colleagues have estimated that only 10% of all patients with 
relapsed/refractory disease will have long term survival following ASCT in the rituximab era (Friedberg, 
2011).  Outcomes are particularly poor for patients who have primary refractory disease after first-line 
therapies with or without rituximab; further, most of these patients are not eligible for transplant due to their 
chemotherapy resistant disease. Published objective response rates (ORRs) to second-line chemotherapy in 
patients with refractory disease range from 0 to 23% (Philip et al, 1995; Josting et al, 2000; Ardeshna et al, 
2005; Telio et al, 2012; Matasar et al, 2013; Hitz et al, 2015), and primary refractory disease was found to 
be a significant risk factor for failing second-line therapy (Moskowitz et al, 1999).  Outcomes are also poor for 
subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL that is refractory to second-line therapy (ORR of 18%) (Seshadri et al, 
2008) or third-line therapy (ORR of 14%) (Ardeshna et al, 2005) . 
Most patients with PMBCL will initially respond to therapy with a rapid decrease in the tumour mass, but rapid 
disease progression during treatment cycles is not uncommon. Second-line treatment strategies are like 
those used for DLBCL, attempting re-induction with non-cross-resistant agents, followed by consolidation 
with HDT-ASCT in those with a chemo-sensitive disease. In general, the outcomes of these patients have 
been disappointing (Sehn et al, 1998; Kuruvilla et al, 2008). The broad use of rituximab in first-line therapy 
has made recurrence less frequent, but harder to manage successfully (Gisselbrecht et al, 2010).  Further, as 
described in Section 3.4, an analysis by the sponsor shows that historically, outcomes for patients 
relapsed/refractory aggressive NHL are similar, regardless of disease subtype. 
Early relapse after ASCT, defined as relapse occurring ≤ 12 months after ASCT, has been found to be an 
adverse prognostic factor for survival in patients with aggressive B-cell NHL.  In an analysis of data from the 
PARMA trial, the ORR to subsequent therapy was 40% for those with an early relapse and 69% for those with 
relapse more than 12 months after ASCT (P < 0.0001), and 8-year overall survival (OS) rates were 13% and 
29% (P < 0.0001) for the 2 subsets (Guglielmi et al, 1998). Similarly, in the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed 
Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL), 4-year event-free survival for patients who had early relapse after ASCT was 
significantly lower than that of subjects who relapsed more than 12 months after ASCT (46% v 56%; p < 
0.05) (Gisselbrecht et al, 2012).  Similarly, Nagle and colleagues (Nagle et al, 2013), reported a significantly 
shorter median OS for patients who had early relapse after ASCT than for those who relapsed ≥ 12 months 
after ASCT (8.2 vs. 26.7 month; P = 0.01). 
Poor outcomes also are observed for patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL who respond to 
salvage therapy, but are ineligible for transplant based on one or more factors, such as age > 65 years, 
inadequate response or early relapse after salvage therapy, relapse after second or greater line of therapy, 
failure to mobilize stem cells for ASCT, or presence of comorbidities or unresolved toxicities.  A review of 
small, single-arm studies showed a median OS ranged from 4 to 13 months for patients with transplant-
ineligible relapsed/refractory DLBCL (Colosia et al, 2014). In the CORAL trial, 129 of 193 patients who 
received third-line therapy, but did not undergo subsequent transplant (transplant ineligible), had worse 
survival than patients who underwent ASCT or allogeneic SCT (34/193 subjects):  median survival was 3.3 
months vs 11.1 months, respectively, and 2-year OS was 9.3% vs. 33.9%, respectively (Van Den Neste E et 
al, 2016). In the Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes de l’Adulte LNH98-5 study of elderly patients with DLBCL, 
77 of 202 patients treated with R-CHOP as first-line therapy experienced a relapse and did not undergo 
transplant; 2-year OS for this group was 26% (Feugier et al, 2005).  In a National Cancer Institute of Canada 
Clinical Trials Group (NCIC-CTG) Phase 2 study of second-line therapy, 17 elderly patients who were not 
considered eligible for transplant had a median survival of 8.9 months (Crump et al, 2004).  Although the 
CORAL study included a small group of patients who underwent ASCT or allogeneic SCT without achieving a 
response to third-line therapy, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (NCCN, 2014) and 
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines (Tilly et al, 2012) suggest that patients who 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 15/127 
  
  
relapse after second-line therapy are unlikely to respond to subsequent therapy and therefore generally are 
not eligible for ASCT. 
According to current ESMO guidelines, clinical trials with novel drugs remain acceptable treatment options for 
subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL or PMBCL who are ineligible for ASCT due to chemo-refractory 
disease or other causes (Tilly et al, 2015; Vitolo et al, 2016). Treatment of relapsed/refractory TFL is not 
addressed in either the 2015 or 2016 ESMO guidelines, as treatment would proceed according to the 
transformed phenotype (in this case, DLBCL) (Wagner-Johnston et al, 2015). 
Thus, the data from the literature indicate that under the current treatment paradigm, where virtually all 
patients will receive rituximab and an anthracycline as first-line therapy, those who are refractory to any line 
of therapy, those who are not eligible to proceed to transplant after relapse, and those who relapse early 
after transplant have uniformly low survival rates and no curative options. 
Collectively, patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL who are ineligible for ASCT have no 
curative options. No therapies are approved in this setting, and both National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) and European Society Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines indicate that there is a clear unmet 
medical need that warrants novel treatment strategies for these patients (NCCN, 2014; Tilly et al, 2015; 
Vitolo et al, 2016).   
About the product 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is an engineered autologous T-cell immunotherapy product whereby a patient’s own T 
cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo by retroviral transduction using an MSCV-based retroviral 
vector to express a CAR comprising an anti-CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to CD28 and 
CD3-zeta co-stimulatory domains. CD19 is expressed as a surface antigen in DLBCL and other aggressive B-
cell lymphomas. The transduced anti-CD19 CAR T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back into the 
patient, where they can recognize and eliminate CD19 expressing target cells. 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel binds to CD19 expressing cancer cells and normal B cells. Following anti-CD19 CAR T 
cell engagement with CD19 expressing target cells, the CD28 and CD3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate 
downstream signalling cascades that lead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions 
and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This sequence of events leads to apoptosis and 
necrosis of CD19 expressing target cells. 
The indication of the marketing authorisation application (MAA) for Yescarta was initially proposed for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary 
mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) who are ineligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). 
The indication agreed at the CAT is for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy.  
YESCARTA is intended, for autologous use only.  
A single dose of YESCARTA contains 2 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells per kg of body weight (or maximum 
of 2 × 108 CAR-positive viable T cells for patients 100 kg and above) in approximately 68 mL suspension in 
an infusion bag.

Type of application and aspects on development 
The CAT and CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the availability of preliminary underlying 
data to support the claim that the product has the potential to bring a therapeutic advantage in r/r DLBCL, 
PMBCL and TFL patients ineligible for ASCT. In this regard, the use of the proposed targeted cell therapy was 
considered to be a major therapeutic innovation. 
However, during assessment the CAT concluded that it was no longer appropriate to maintain the accelerated 
assessment procedure as the evaluation of the dossier was no longer compatible with the previously agreed 
timetable. The reason for this is attributable to the adoption of a substantial list of questions, including major 
objections and the need for a GCP inspection during the course of the procedure. Subsequently, the 
assessment of the application reverted to a standard timetable. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
YESCARTA (axicabtagene ciloleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell 
immunotherapy. To prepare YESCARTA, patient’s own T cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo 
by retroviral transduction to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprising a murine anti-CD19 single 
chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to CD28 and CD3-zeta co-stimulatory domains. The anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells are expanded and infused back into the patient, where they can recognize and eliminate CD19-
expressing target cells. 
Each patient specific single infusion bag of YESCARTA contains a suspension of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, 
strength 0.4 x 108 - 2 x 108 cells in approximately 68 mL. 
YESCARTA is presented as a clear to opaque, white to red dispersion of cells for infusion formulated with 
Cryostor CS10 (5% dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO)), sodium chloride and human serum albumin. 
YESCARTA is supplied in an ethylene-vinyl acetate cryostorage bag individually packed in a shipping cassette. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is produced from leukapheresis material obtained from individual patients, and 
therefore the product is unique to each patient. The patient’s T cells are engineered ex vivo to express the 
anti-CD19 CAR using a replication incompetent γ-retroviral vector containing the CAR transgene. 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the gene therapy retroviral vector 
PG13-CD19-H3 and part 2 for the transduced cells resulting in the active substance axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
The entire manufacturing process is covered by respective GMP certificates. 
Part 1 - Retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3 
General information (retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3) 
The retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3 is a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based vector pseudotyped with the 
gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelope.  
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 17/127 
  
  
The  MSCV  vector  is  a  long  terminal  repeat  (LTR)-driven  non-self-inactivating  (SIN)  retroviral  vector  that 
encompasses  the  5’LTR  (also  promoter  for  transgene  expression),  a  packaging  signal  including  the  splice 
donor and splice acceptor sites, the FMC63-based (anti-CD19 FMC63-CD28-CD3ζ) CAR sequence containing a 
human GM-CSF receptor signal peptide, FMC63 light chain variable region, linker peptide, FMC63 heavy chain 
variable  region,  CD28  (hinge,  transmembrane  and  cytoplasmic  region),  and  CD3ζ  (cytoplasmic  region), 
followed by the MSCV 3'LTR (Figure 1).  
Transfer of genetic material into T cells occurs via retroviral transduction of autologous T cells. The 
manufacturing of the vector is based on a stable packaging cell clone PG13-CD19-H3 from which a Master 
Cell bank (MCB)/Working Cell Bank (WCB) system has been established.

Manufacturing process (retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3) 
The  applicant  provided  an  adequate  description  of  the  vector  manufacturing  process.  This  includes  the 
description of the manufacturing process steps, flow-charts and description of the IPCs and operating ranges 
and/or acceptance limits. 
The PG13-CD19-H3 vector is produced constitutively from a stably-transduced PG13 (ATCC CRL-10686™) cell 
line.  For  production  of  retroviral  vector  under  GMP,  cells  from  a  single  vial  of  WCB  are  expanded  and  the 
culture supernatant is harvested, filtered and filled into cryostorage bags.

Control of materials (retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3) 
The  packaging  cell  clone  is  based  on  PG13  cells,  a  cell  line  that  is  commonly  used  to  generate  retroviral 
vector  particles  by  introducing  a  γ-retroviral  transfer  vector  of  interest.  These  NIH3T3-derived  cells  stably 
express  the  Gibbon  Ape  Leukemia  Virus  (GALV)  envelope  and  the  Moloney  murine  leukemia  virus  (MoMLV) 
gag-pol proteins. 
Stable, retroviral transfer of the PG13-CD19 transfer vector and subsequent selection of the cell clone PG13-
CD19-H3 were conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, Maryland, US). As the vector has 
the full 3’LTRs (and is no SIN-vector) the proviral DNA will have two functional LTRs, and due to cellular co-
expression  of  the  MoMLV  gag-pol  and  the  GALV  envelope,  vector  particles  are  produced  and  constitutively 
released  into  the  supernatant.  Both  cell  banks  are  established  under  Good  Manufacturing  Practices  (GMP). 
Overall  the  testing  strategy  and  characterisation  of  the  cell  banks  is  considered  adequate.  The  genetic 
stability  of  the  WCB  and  end-of-production  (EOP)  has  been  investigated.  The  test  method  and  results  are 
adequately described. Genetic stability of the construct has been demonstrated.  
Adequate information and acceptance criteria are given for all the listed ingredients. 
The MCB was tested and released based on the ICH Q5A (R1) guideline. A single vial of the PG13-CD19-CAR-
H3 MCB was used to produce 323 vials of WCB. The WCB has been shown to be free of bacterial, fungal and 
mycoplasma contamination in compliance with ICH Q5A (R1) and Ph. Eur. (5.2.3). The WCB was also found 
to be negative for replication-competent retrovirus.  
Manufacturing process development and validation (retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3) 
An  initial  manufacturing  process  has  been  developed.  Further  adaptations  were  made,  leading  to  the 
commercial process.  
For  process  validation  of  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  three  manufacturing  runs  have  been 
conducted,  two  at  small-scale  and  one  at  full-scale  level  using  15  CS10  cell  stacks.  The  rationale  and  the 
provided  data  show  that  the  manufacturing  at  small-scale  is  representative  for  the  commercial  large-scale 
run and considered acceptable.  
In  the  manufacturing  process  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  vector  supernatant  is  used  for  the  transduction  of 
peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs).  Sub-analyses  of  batches  harvested  show  consistency  within  a 
campaign  and  within  the  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  with 
respect to titre and impurities levels. 
As  terminal  sterilisation  is  inapplicable  for  the  vector  starting  material,  aseptic  manufacturing  was  validated 
with  successfully  completed  process  simulation  runs  and  adequate  requalification.  Method  suitability  for  the 
test  on  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.  2.6.1,  direct  inoculation),  mycoplasmas  (Ph.  Eur.  2.6.7,  culture  and  indicator  cell 
culture assay) and endotoxin (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, LAL) has been sufficiently clarified, demonstrating compliance 
with Ph. Eur. requirements. 
The ongoing process verification (OPV) run by the applicant is endorsed. According to the applicant the 
actions to be taken in the event of control rule violations are defined in the OPV program. 
Characterisation (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The  characterisation  of  the  PG13-CD19-H3  vector  included  both  structure  and  function.  The  studies 
demonstrated that the PG13-CD19-H3 vector encodes the FMC63-CD28-CD3ζ transgene. Transduction results 
in  integration  of  the  vector  genome  into  the  genome  of  the  T  cells.  The  FMC63-CD28-CD3ζ  transgene  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 19/127 
  
  
transcribed  to  RNA  and  translated  to  anti-CD19  CAR.  Anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  bind  to  CD19  expressing  cells. 
Upon  engagement  with  CD19,  T  cells  are  activated  and  secrete  IFN-γ.  Detection  of  IFN-γ  is  considered  an 
appropriate measure of functionality of the CAR construct. 
Characterisation of PG13-CD19-H3 vector impurities was performed to evaluate process consistency among 
PG13-CD19-H3 vector lots. Specific components were evaluated in detail. 
Impurities identified were host cell protein, HC-DNA, BSA and p30 protein. Each harvest of PG13-CD19-H3 
vector is considered a unique lot, and testing is conducted to assure sterility, while safety tests for 
mycoplasma, in vitro virus and replication competent retrovirus (RCR) are performed only on material in the 
last harvest from the production campaign. The last harvest is considered a worst-case condition, and testing 
at this stage assures that the entire production campaign remains free of adventitious agents and that 
replication competent retrovirus is not present.  
Specification (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The applicant provided a justification for the setting of specifications that is mainly based on manufacturing 
experience. Specifications cover appearance, identity, titer, activity and safety testing. 
The PG13-CD19-H3 vector undergoes testing for adventitious agents prior to release for use in production of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. The retroviral vector harvest is tested for adventitious viruses by in vitro assay and 
for replication competent viruses (RCR). All PG13-CD19-H3 vector lots tested to date have been negative for 
adventitious viruses and RCR. Study reports on the vector harvest testing were provided. In addition, the 
provided risk evaluation regarding potential generation of RCR during manufacture is acceptable. It is agreed 
that the occurrence of RCR in Yescarta is considered unlikely. 
The analytical procedures used for release testing of PG13-CD19-H3 vector have been validated or verified as 
appropriate. Validations of the non-compendial analytical methods used to analyse PG13-CD19-H3 vector 
were performed in accordance with the ICH Q2(R1) guideline, Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and 
Methodology. Verifications of the compendial analytical methods for Endotoxin, Mycoplasma, and Sterility 
testing of PG13-CD19-H3 vector were performed in accordance with guidance in ICH Q2(R1), the United 
States Pharmacopoeia (USP), and the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). All of these verifications showed 
no sample matrix interference effects, confirming that the methods are suitable for the testing of PG13-
CD19-H3 Vector. 
Summaries of the validations and verifications for each method are provided. 
The analytical methods for PG13-CD19-H3 vector produce quantitative results. Batch analysis data are 
available for lots of PG13-CD19-H3 vector manufactured and released in accordance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practices.  
Stability (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The stability of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector is being evaluated via long-term studies. In addition, the stability 
of PG13-CD19-H3 vector stored at either accelerated or stress (room temperature) conditions has been 
evaluated. All studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products: 
Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products.  
Long-term stability studies are ongoing with 8 lots of PG13-CD19-H3 vector stored at the recommended     
storage temperature. These studies are being conducted with lots used for clinical production, lots used for 
process validation and potential commercial production, and lots designated for commercial production. All of 
the PG13-CD19-H3 vector lots were manufactured by the commercial manufacturer.

PG13-CD19-H3 vector was exposed to elevated temperature to support potential temperature excursions that 
may occur during long term storage or during transportation.  
Stress testing was conducted on samples from. The objective of this testing was to evaluate the potential for 
several tests routinely performed as part of PG13-CD19-H3 vector stability studies to be stability indicating. 
As such, test results for each lot were trended against results obtained at time zero. 
Part 2: axicabtagene ciloleucel 
General information (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
The active substance consists of autologous T cells genetically modified ex vivo by transduction with a 
retroviral vector to express an anti-CD19 CD28/CD3ζ CAR to target CD19 on the cell surface of malignant B 
cells. The mechanism of action is shown in Figure 2.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
The manufacturing process of axicabtagene ciloleucel starts with apheresis collection from a patient. The 
applicant confirmed that apheresis for procurement of the cell starting material is performed in centres which 
have been authorised or licensed by the competent authorities and qualified by the applicant (Directive 
2004/23/EC). A statement is included in the SmPC for healthcare professionals handling Yescarta to take 
appropriate precautions to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases. It is further stated that 
throughout the manufacturing process, universal precautions are taken to avoid potential transmission of 
infectious diseases for all patients.   
The next steps in the manufacturing process include lymphocyte enrichment, T-cell activation, retroviral 
transduction and T-cell expansion.  
Description of the manufacturing process is very brief. However, for each step the process parameters, the 
proven acceptable range, the normal operating range or set point and the classification into critical and non-
critical process parameters have been presented. The applicant established a control strategy within the 
manufacturing facility, which is considered acceptable. 
Control of critical steps is based on performance parameters which have an impact on critical quality 
attributes are classified as critical. 
Product traceability of axicabtagene ciloleucel from apheresis material to finished product is sufficiently 
described. The applicant maintains unique patient identifiers to ensure product traceability. This assures a 
patient’s apheresis material is manufactured to Yescarta and the appropriate lot is returned to the patient. 
Information on the product label is verified upon receipt of each lot upon importation into Europe from the 
Kite manufacturing site in the US. 
Control of materials (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
All establishments and personnel involved in cell procurement and testing of the apheresis material are 
qualified by a competent authority for the purpose of those activities. This includes also the use of CE-marked 
kits for respective donor testing.  
The donor procurement and testing follow the national requirements of the member states where the product 
will be marketed, in line with Directive 2006/17/EC. 
The applicant provided an overview of the reagents used in manufacturing of the active substance, the 
testing requirements and respective acceptance criteria as well as the intended use. For the latter one, 
measures are in place to ensure adequate quality for manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Several different types of disposable materials are used during manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel. A

Regarding microbiological safety, process performance qualification and process validation were successfully 
completed with all lots complying with microbiological release specifications. Aseptic process validation (APV) 
at  has  been  thoroughly  described  demonstrating  consideration  of  relevant  APV  interventions  and  adequate 
incubation  conditions.  All  APV  runs  were  successfully  completed  and  post-incubation  growth  promotion 
demonstrated for tryptic soy broth. 
Transport validation of the frozen PBMC from the EU site to the US site for further manufacturing has been 
demonstrated.  Furthermore,  the  applicant  confirms  that  commercial  shipment  will  be  performed  with  a 
temperature logger.  
Traceability of the final product was established for all, with  lots of final product sent from Kite Pharma, US, 
to Lonza Netherlands B.V. and then to  a mock treatment center. 
Manufacturing process development (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
History  of  process  development  has  been  described  for  the  different  manufacturing  steps.  For  some  steps 
different raw materials and parameters have been evaluated. Most of the development steps are sufficiently 
described and the chosen parameters and materials justified.  
For process characterisation, a formal risk assessment has been performed and different steps of the process 
have been experimentally addressed by intentionally varying selected process parameters to identify critical 
process parameters (CPPs) for process consistency and product quality.  
Development of other important process stages included analysis of apheresis starting material regarding use 
of  different  apheresis  equipment,  different  apheresis  storage  temperatures  and  time  and  their  impact  on 
performance  parameters  at  different  stages  during  manufacturing.  From  the  few  batches  tested,  apheresis 
equipment and storage time within the set limits seem to have no impact on the analysed parameters.  
Selected parameters for the cryopreservation step have been analysed and shown to be suitable.  
Comparability  
Data from comparability studies to support changes introduced during development were provided and are 
considered acceptable. 
Characterisation (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
Product  characterisation  data  supporting  the  mechanism  of  action  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  have  been 
provided  and  include  studies  on  integration  of  the  CAR  gene,  CAR  expression,  antigen  recognition  and 
engagement,  activation  and  release  of  cytokines,  killing  of  target  cells,  cell  composition  and  T-cell 
phenotypes as well as multiplicity of infection. 
Characterisation studies are focusing on parameters determining the potency of the active substance. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
The manufacturing process for axicabtagene ciloleucel is a continuous process, and the transition from active 
substance  to  finished  product  does  not  include  any  hold  steps,  hence,  specification,  analytical  procedures, 
validation of analytical procedures, batch analysis and justification of specifications, respectively are provided 
in  the  final  product  section.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  product,  the  applicant’s  approach  is  considered 
acceptable.

studies have been performed at that level. Data have been provided on the stability of the cryopreserved 
PBMCs which are considered to be an intermediate in active substance manufacturing. 
Stability data collected to date confirmed that PBMC stored at the established storage condition are stable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel final product) consists of autologous T cells that have been genetically 
modified ex vivo to express a chimeric antigen receptor to target CD19 on the cell surface of malignant B 
cells. The active substance of Yescarta, axicabtagene ciloleucel, is composed of a patient’s T cells that have 
undergone ex vivo T-cell activation, gene transfer by replication-deficient retroviral vector (PG13-CD19-H3 
vector), and expansion. These transduced T cells are then formulated in a cryopreservation medium suitable 
for infusion. Each final product bag of Yescarta is filled to deliver a target dose of 1.0 x 106 to 2.0 x 106 CAR 
positive viable T cells/kg of patient weight. Yescarta is supplied cryopreserved at a temperature of ≤ -150°C 
in cryostorage bags. The cryostorage bag contains a nominal volume of 68 mL of formulated axicabtagene 
ciloleucel final product. The composition of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel final product) consists of anti-
CD19 CAR-T cells formulated with Cryostor CS10, sodium chloride and human albumin.  
The  active  substance  of  Yescarta  comprises  CD3-positive  T  cells  that  have  been  transduced  with  an  anti-
CD19 CAR using a retroviral vector. The product may also contain a small percentage of autologous natural 
killer  (NK)  cells  or  cells  with  a  phenotypic  characteristic  of  NK  T  cells.  B  cells,  monocytes  and  other  white 
blood cells are present at very low levels.  
Excipients  used  for  the  production  of  finished  product  are  0,9%  sodium  chloride  injection  which  provides, 
albumin (human) which is a stabiliser and  CryoStor CS10 agent.  
A series of development studies were conducted to determine the optimal conditions for cryopreservation of 
Yescarta.  
It was agreed that CryoStor is not regarded as a novel excipient. 
The  primary  container  closure  system  intended  for  distribution  of  Yescarta  is  CryoStore,  commercially 
available, CE-marked ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) cryostorage bag specifically designed for storage of blood 
and blood components. 
The suitability of the primary container closure system has been shown based on results from extractable and 
leachable testing, container closure integrity testing, and long-term and accelerated stability studies. 
The secondary packaging for Yescarta is an aluminium cassette, designed to protect the product during 
storage, shipment, and handling. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Information regarding the manufacturer of Yescarta is provided. 
The entire manufacturing process is covered by respective GMP certificates.

Each bag of Yescarta is filled to deliver a target dose of 1.0 x 106 to 2.0 x 106 CAR T cells/kg of patient weight 
in a nominal volume of 68 mL. The batch formula is equivalent to the composition of the final product. 
The finished product manufacturing process is well described. The whole manufacturing process is continuous 
with transition from active substance to finished product without holding steps.  
The commercial manufacturing process for Yescarta is essentially unchanged from the clinical manufacturing 
process. Flow diagram of the Yescarta manufacturing process is provided. 
Yescarta is formulated with 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), human serum albumin (HSA), and CryoStor CS10 
prior to the cryopreservation step. 
Process validation has been addressed in the active substance part. 
The final product is shipped to Lonza, NL frozen in a dry-vapor liquid-nitrogen shipper. A transport validation 
has been performed. A temperature monitoring device is included in each shipper. 
Product specification 
Since the manufacturing process from receipt of the apheresis starting material through to finished product is 
continuous  and  no  active  substance  is  isolated,  it  is  considered  acceptable  that  only  specifications  for  the 
finished  product  has  been  provided.  Product  specification  includes  control  of  identity,  purity  and  impurities, 
potency (including cell viability and anti-CD19 CAR expression) and other general tests.  
The analytical methods, the unique identification numbers and the corresponding pre-set acceptance criteria 
have been provided. 
The  analytical  methods  in  the  finished  product  part  have  been  described  and  are  adequately  validated. 
Summary  of  method  validation  parameters  and  corresponding  results  have  been  provided.  All  method 
validations  met  the  acceptance  criteria  set  in  the  corresponding  validation  protocols.  Validation  information 
demonstrating  that  the  compendial  and  non-compendial  analytical  procedures  used  to  test  finished  product 
are suitable for their intended purpose is presented.  
Batch analyses are provided for lots of Yescarta that were manufactured at the proposed commercial site. 
The applicant justifies omission of repeated release testing in the EU by referencing to point 11.17 of Part IV 
- GMP requirements for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products of EudraLex Volume 4.  
Stability of the product 
The applicant’s formal stability program includes lots of Yescarta held at recommended and/or accelerated 
storage conditions. 
Based on the provided data, the applicant’s proposed shelf life of 12 months at -1500C is accepted.  
The stability of Yescarta upon completion of thawing is up to 3 hours at room temperature (20°C to 25°C).  A 
post-thaw hold time up to 3 hours was shown to not result in altered.  
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Raw materials of animal or human origin are used in the production of Yescarta. Compliance with the TSE 
guideline has been demonstrated for raw materials used for vector production and cell banking by providing 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 25/127 
  
  
valid EDQM certificates of suitability. Human serum albumin (HSA) is used as excipient. It is a marketed 
product in Europe with reference to an E.U. plasma master file (EMEA/H/PMF/000008/05/II/017/G). All other 
reagents used during vector production and T-cell transduction are in compliance with the TSE guideline 
(EMA/410/01 rev.3). The donors of the T cells are of autologous origin and therefore the TSE risk is not 
relevant. In summary, compliance of animal-derived materials with the current TSE-guideline and compliance 
of the human-derived material with E.U. or U.S. TSE relevant regulations is demonstrated and supported by 
respective certificates. 
Virus safety 
Due to the nature of the product, the manufacturing process of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector and of the Yescarta 
finished product does not contain any step that removes or inactivates viruses. In addition, the final finished 
product is not tested for adventitious viruses. Control of adventitious agents is mainly based on selection and 
testing of starting materials and raw materials of biological origin and testing of the retroviral vector. In order 
to  ensure  safety  of  the  product,  procedural  controls  are  followed  for  acceptance  of  material  used  in  the 
manufacture of PG13-CD19-H3 vector and axicabtagene ciloleucel. These controls are as follows:  
1.  Safety testing of the PG13-CD19-CAR-H3 master cell bank and PG13-CD19-CAR-H3 working cell bank  
2.  Procedural controls, raw material controls, and safety testing of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector   
3.  Media and reagents used in the manufacturing of Yescarta are sourced from qualified vendors 
This strategy is considered acceptable.  
Virus safety of Yescarta is sufficiently shown. 
GMO 
The GMO are autologous T-cells genetically modified with a non-SIN retroviral vector based on MSCV 
pseudotyped with the GALV envelope protein and encoding the CAR consisting of a CD19-specific scFv and 
the CD28/CD3-zeta costimulatory domains under control of the MSCV 5´LTR enhancer/promoter region. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
A  major  objection  was  identified  during  the  procedure  and  was  related  to  the  fact  that  consistency  of 
transduction of the autologous cells had not been fully demonstrated.  
On the basis of the comprehensive responses and clarification provided by the applicant, together with various 
commitments, the issue was considered resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Yescarta is considered acceptable. The different aspects of the chemical, 
pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of 
the active substance is adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well 
characterised and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has 
been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test 
methods and specifications. Adventitious agents safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured.  
The CHMP endorsed the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and

biological aspects as described above.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the applicant to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
several points for investigation, including the manufacturing process and control of the product, were 
recommended. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT assessment regarding the recommendations for future quality development.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  Applicant  provided  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  non-clinical  pharmacology  data  for  KTE-C19.  For  in  vitro 
evaluation of specific activity against CD19+ target cells, the Applicant used CD19 CAR T cells from patients 
that  were  enrolled  in  clinical  trials  conducted by  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI).  Single-dose  toxicology 
studies in animals were not performed by the Applicant due to the lack of a relevant animal model. Instead, 
evaluation of potential on-target/off-tumour activity has been included into a non-GLP primary pharmacology 
study  using  anti-murine  CD19  CAR  T  cells  as  a  surrogate  for  studies  of  the  human  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cell 
product. 
Data  on  the  comparability  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  product  manufactured  by  the  CLP-1.0  process  and  the 
CLP-2.0 process were submitted.  
The pharmacological studies submitted were either literature publications or non-GLP studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Comparability between NCI and Kite Products 
The manufacturing process of the CD19 CAR T cells from patients with melanoma (CLP-1.0) differed from the 
manufacturing  process  of  the  CD19  CAR  T  cells  patients  with  advanced  B-cell  haematologic  malignancies 
(CLP-2.0).  Differences  were  as  follows:  in  CLP-2.0,  T  cells  were  stimulated,  transduced  and  expanded  in 
closed bags using serum-free media and harvested after 6 to 8 days in culture, then cryopreserved prior to 
use. The CLP-2.0 process is similar to the CLP-2.2 process used for KTE-C19, but CLP-2.2  
The  comparability  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  product  manufactured  by  the  CLP-1.0  process  and  the  CLP-2.0 
process  was  demonstrated  through  split  apheresis  studies  at  NCI,  which  showed  a  lower  transduction 
efficiency of the  CLP-2.0  process as compared to the CLP-1.0 process (37.1  ± 6.1% compared with 78.4 ± 
5.4%, respectively), while total cell numbers, fold expansion, the INF-γ release upon co-culture with CD19+ 
target cells, and the phenotypic evaluation was similar. Products prepared by the CLP-2.0 process (NCI) and 
the  CLP-2.2  process  (Kite)  were  compared  directly  using  split  apheresis  products  from  4  subjects.  These 
studies  demonstrated  statistically  equivalent  transduction  efficiency  for  the  NCI  CLP-2.0  product  and  KTE-
C19,  and  similarity  for  in-process  parameters  (wash  step  yield,  percent  viability  on  Day  2,  Day  3,  and  at

harvest; and fold expansion), potency (ie, level of IFN-γ produced upon co-culture of anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
with CD19+ target cells) and cell growth profiles.   
CD19 Expression Profile Summary 
Targeting  B-lineage  haematologic  malignancies  via  CD19  is  based  on  earlier  findings  demonstrating  that 
expression of CD19 is restricted to cells, both normal and malignant, of the B-lineage. Early publications by 
Nadler and colleagues (Nadler et al, 1983; Anderson et al, 1984) showed that CD19 protein is expressed on 
all  B-lineage lymphoid  cells,  from  the  pro-B-cell  maturation  stage  to  naïve  and  differentiated  B  cells.  Uckun 
and  colleagues  (Uckun  et  al,  1988)  confirmed  and  extended  these  findings  by  demonstrating  that  leukemic 
progenitor B cells also express CD19, and that erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytoid, and multilineage normal 
bone  marrow  progenitor  cells  do  not  express  CD19.  More  recently,  Johnson  and  colleagues  (Johnson  et  al, 
2009)  showed  that  primary  lymphoma  cells  from  patients  with  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL) 
expressed  CD19,  whereas  reference  T  cells  did  not.  Olejniczak  and  colleagues  (Olejniczak  et  al,  2006) 
examined  the  expression  pattern  and  levels  of  CD19  in  peripheral  blood,  bone  marrow,  and  lymph  node 
tissue  from  patients  with 6  different  common  B-cell  malignancies  (CLL,  small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  [SLL], 
B-lineage  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  [ALL],  hairy  cell  leukemia  [HCL],  DLBCL,  and  follicular  lymphoma 
[FL]). Nearly all samples within each type were considered positive for CD19. Expression levels of CD19 were 
variable  across  the  different  B-cell  malignancies,  but  all  B-cell  malignancies  examined  showed  consistently 
measurable  levels  of  CD19  expression  above  reference  CD3+  T  cells.  In  summary,  evidence  from  key 
published literature demonstrates that CD19 is expressed on the surface of normal B-lineage cells as well as 
most  B-cell  malignancies,  including  DLBCL  and  FL,  two  subtypes  of  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL).  Other 
investigators  have  shown  that  CD19  is  also  expressed  in  primary  mediastinal  B-cell  lymphoma  (PMBCL) 
(Rodriguez et al, 1994) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (Leonard et al, 2001). 
In Vitro 
Characterization of Human Anti-CD19 CAR T Cells 
Initial  in  vitro  characterization  studies  were  performed  using  anti-CD19  CAR-transduced  T cells,  generated 
using  T cells  from  patients  with  melanoma.  The  anti-CD19  CAR-transduced  T  cells  were  generated  at  NCI 
using the CLP-1.0 process.  
The specificity and potency of the anti-CD19 CAR T cells were evaluated by measuring their ability to produce 
IFN-γ in response to co-culture with either CD19+ or CD19- target cells. For each experiment, transduced T 
cells  were  cultured  overnight  with  target  cells  and  IFN-γ  secreted  into  the  media  was  measured  using  an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that production of cytokines by anti-CD19 CAR 
T  cells  was  dependent  on  both  the  presence  of  the  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  and  the  co-culture  with  CD19+ 
target cells. For control cultures containing either transduced or nontransduced T cells co-cultured with CD19- 
target cells or no target cells, only minimal cytokine production was observed. 
The  characteristics  and  specificity  of  the  T  cells  transduced  with  the  anti-CD19  CAR  construct  were  further 
assessed  by  comparing  phenotype,  scFv  expression  and  cytokine  induction  using  K562  cells  (a  cell  line 
derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia) engineered to express either CD19 or, as a negative 
control,  the  low  affinity  human  nerve  growth  factor  receptor  (CD19-K562  and  NGFR-K562,  respectively). 
Results  from  these  experiments  demonstrated  that  CD3+  T  cells  expressed  the  anti-CD19  CAR  and  both 
CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells produced IFN-γ in a CAR- and CD19-specific manner. The percentage of CD3+

T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) that produced IFN-γ in response to a CD19+ target (54%) was generally consistent 
with the percentage of CD3+ T cells that expressed the FMC63 scFv (ie, 45%, the transduction efficiency). 
Biological  activity  of  the  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  was  also  tested in  a  cytotoxicity  assay.  Control  T  cells  were 
transduced  with  a  CAR  construct  (SP6-28Z),  analogous  to  FMC6328-Z,  but  specific  for  hapten  2,  4,  6-
trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Results demonstrated that T cells transduced with FMC63-28Z killed primary CLL 
cells in a dose-dependent and CD19-specific manner, while the T cells transduced with SP6-28Z did not.  
Figure 1 Cytotoxicity of anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
Additional  characterization  studies  were  performed  to  analyze  the  composition  (percent  transduction  and 
phenotype), specificity, and biological activity of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells derived from 15 subjects 
with advanced NHL enrolled in NCI Protocol 09-C-0082 investigating anti-CD19 CAR T cells for the treatment 
of  patients  with  advanced  B-cell  haematologic  malignancies.  The  anti-CD19  CAR-transduced  T  cells  were 
generated at NCI using the CLP-2.0 process.  
Product composition was determined by immunophenotypic analysis of surface markers (CD3, CD4, CD8 and 
CD45RA)  by  flow  cytometry.  The  markers  CCR7  and  CD45RA  are  broadly  utilized  to  distinguish  between 
naïve  (CCR7+CD45RA+),  central  memory  (CCR7+CD45RA-),  effector  memory  (CCR7-CD45RA-)  and  effector 
(CCR7-CD45RA+)  human  T-cell  subsets.  Phenotyping  assays  showed  that  the anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  derived 
from these subjects with advanced NHL comprised both CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the 
transduced  T  cells  primarily  comprised  central  memory  T  cells  (Tcm)  and  effector  memory  T  cells  (Tem),  as 
defined by CCR7/CD45RA surface expression. 
Specificity,  potency,  and  poly-functionality  of  the  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  derived  from  the  15  subjects  with 
advanced  NHL  were  further  evaluated  utilizing  LuminexTM  to  measure  cytokines  produced  during  co-culture 
with  CD19-K562  or  NGFR-K562  (negative  control)  target  cell  lines.  A  panel  of  17  different  cytokines, 
chemokines,  and  effector  molecules  with  various  immunomodulatory  roles  was  measured  in  co-cultures  of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells and target cells.  
The 17 analytes comprised the following: IL-2 as a marker of immune cell homeostasis and proliferation; IL-
6, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
as markers of pro-inflammatory activity; IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-γ, and soluble CD137 as markers of immune-

modulating  activity;  macrophage  inflammatory  protein  (MIP)-1α  and  MIP-1β  as  chemokines;  and  granzyme 
A,  granzyme  B,  soluble  FAS  ligand  (sFASL),  soluble  FAS  (receptor  for  sFASL),  and  perforin  as  effector 
molecules.  All  subject-derived  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  products  produced  IFN-γ  when  incubated  with  CD19-
K562  target  cells,  consistent  with  the  in  vitro  data  (Kochenderfer  et  al,  2009).  Induction  of  all  17  analytes 
occurred  in  a  CD19-dependent  manner.  These  data  demonstrate  that  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  products 
generated  from  multiple  donors  all  exhibit  CD19-dependent  activation,  and  the  capacity  to  produce  diverse 
biological factors in response to CAR stimulation. 
Characterization of an Anti-Murine CD19 CAR Construct Analogous to KTE-C19 
Since the anti-CD19 scFv utilized for KTE-C19 does only recognize human CD19, a murine surrogate was 
engineered for non-clinical proof-of-concept studies in immune competent mice. This surrogate model used 
an anti-murine CD19 CAR construct that was similar to KTE-C19 with the exception of the scFv, which has 
been derived from the 1D3 mAb recognizing murine CD19. Murine T cells were transduced with the anti-
murine CD19 CAR construct and adoptively transferred into syngeneic mice challenged with a CD19-
expressing 38c13 lymphoma cell line to investigate the anti-lymphoma effect of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T 
cells.  
In addition, the surrogate murine CD19 CAR T cells were investigated in vitro for CD19-specific activation by 
measuring INF-γ release in co-cultures of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells and CD19+ and CD19- target 
cells. Thereby, the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells also revealed some basal activity in the presence of CD19- 
cells as well as in the absence of any target cells. The basal activity became evident by a ~30-50 fold 
increase in IFN-γ release when comparing transduced T cells with untransduced cells in the control situations. 
Irrespective of this basal activity, a significant increase of secreted IFN-γ was still observed, when the CD19 
CAR T cells were co-cultured with CD19+ target cells. A similar basal activity was not observed with the anti-
human CD19 CAR T cells.  
In Vivo 
Studies Using a Murine Model of Lymphoma and Anti-murine CD19 CAR T Cells  
The administration of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells into the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model revealed 
both the ability of the CD19 CAR T cells to prevent establishment of a lymphoma and to eradicate already 
established lymphoma masses including metastasis. Administration of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells in 
both the prophylactic and the therapeutic setting resulted in prolonged survival of the mice while control 
animals became rapidly moribund due to lymphoma and were euthanized. Using the syngeneic mouse 
lymphoma model, the Applicant also investigated the influence of total body irradiation (TBI) prior to the 
administration of the lymphoma cells and the CD19 CAR T cells which revealed the importance of the TBI-
induced lymphodepletion for prolonged survival of these animals and thus for a successful outcome of the 
CAR T cell therapy.

Distribution 
The persistence of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells was also evaluated in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma 
model using flow cytometry analysis.  
The chosen model provides expansion, and survival of the CD19 CAR T cells (e.g. CD19+ target tumour cells, 
endogenous  cytokines,  chemokines  and  cellular  interactions of  a  fully  functional  immune  system).  The  anti-
murine  CD19  CAR  T  cells  could  only  be  detected in  spleen  at  Day  8,  but  no  longer  at  Day  63  post-infusion 
(Kochenderfer et al., 2010a). Thus, persistence of CD19 CAR T cells could only be demonstrated for a short 
time  period,  despite  a  prolonged  anti-lymphoma  effect  and  B-cell  aplasia  which  were  evident  for  up  to  the 
209  days  (the  latest  time  point  investigated).  Presence  of  anti-murine  CD19  CAR  T  cells  in  spleen  was 
investigated 8 days and 63 days post-infusion. 
No other non-clinical pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. 
Metabolism 
The  anticipated  metabolic  products  of  KTE-C19,  a  human  autologous  T-cell  product,  are  typical  cellular 
degradation products resulting from normal cellular clearance mechanisms (Erwig and Henson 2008).  
Excretion 
Elimination of T cells from the body is not regulated by excretion; rather by physiological processes such as 
T-cell apoptosis. Thus, standard excretion pharmacokinetic analysis techniques do not apply. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Appropriate in vitro and in vivo models to assess potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions for KTE-C19, an 
autologous  human  T-cell  product,  do  not  exist.  Possible  impact  of  drugs  used  for  management  of  cytokine 
release syndrome (e.g. by altering T cell function) is discussed in the context of clinical safety.

On-target/off-tumour toxicity of CD19 CAR T cells  
On-target/off-tumour toxicity of CD19 CAR T cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, which has been 
evaluated during the pharmacology study in parallel with the anti-lymphoma effect and the persistence of the 
anti-murine  CD19  CAR  T  cells.  The  observed  prolonged  depletion  of  normal  B  cells  known  to  express  CD19 
confirmed  the  expected  on-target/off-tumour  effect  of  the  CD19  CAR  T  cells  on  normal  B  cells.  Additional 
toxicities of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells did not became evident in the pharmacology studies. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeat-dose toxicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
The combination of both the use of a γ-retroviral vector with full-length viral LTRs and the high proliferative 
potential of the transduced T cells provides a certain risk of insertional oncogenesis. A detailed evaluation of 
published  literature  was  provided  that  addressed  the  resistance  of  mature  mouse  T  cells  to  transformation 
induced by genomic integration of γ-retroviral vectors. The clinical experience with administration of human T 
cells  that  were  transduced  with  γ-retroviral  vectors  to  either  express  the  KTE-C19  CAR  construct  itself  or 
other transgenes did so far not reveal cases of insertional oncogenesis.  
These data implies a very low likelihood for T cell transformation induced by γ-retroviral insertional 
mutagenesis. Moreover, the high resistance of mouse T cells to cell transformation described by Newrzela et 
al indicates that this aspect can hardly be investigated in a mouse model.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Toxicokinetic data 
Not applicable. 
Local tolerance  
No local tolerance studies were conducted (see non-clinical discussion).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment was performed in accordance with Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC on 
the deliberate release into environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and following the 
precautionary principle using the methodology set down in Commission Decisions 2001/83/EC,  
2002/812/EC, 2002/623/EC and EMA guidelines on environmental risk assessments for medicinal products 
consisting of, or containing GMOs  (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/473191/2006) and on scientific requirements for the 
environmental risk assessment of gene therapy medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/GTWP/125491/2006).  
In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, national competent authorities established 
under Directive 2001/18/EC have been consulted. 
The ERA included as part of the submission of the MAA discusses the environmental risk assessment for the 
clinical use of YESCARTA. Potential risks for the environment associated with the clinical use of YESCARTA are 
generation and transmission of replication competent retroviruses (RCRs), transmission of residual infectious 
retroviral vector particles, or transmission of genetically modified T-cells. Since either the likelihood of these 
risks or the potential hazards have been evaluated to be negligible, the overall environmental risk has also 
been concluded as negligible. This conclusion has been supported during the consultation process.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical in vitro pharmacology studies were performed with CD19 CAR T cells that were generated using 
two previous manufacturing processes established at the NCI (CLP-1.0 and CLP-2.0); neither of them 
represents the current process (CLP-2.2). It was agreed in the context of scientific advice that the non-
clinical data generated with CD19 CAR T cells manufactured at NCI do not need to be repeated with CD19 
CAR T cells manufactured using the current CLP-2.2 process provided that comparability and equivalent 
performance of the products derived from the different manufacturing processes can be demonstrated. Data 
from split apheresis studies performed at NCI were provided that compared the CLP-1.0 and the CLP-2.0 
processes. Although these data revealed a lower transduction rate of the CLP-2.0 process (37.1 ± 6.1%) as 
compared to the CLP-1.0 process (78.4 ± 5.4%), the specific activity against CD19+ target cells was not 
impaired as demonstrated by a comparable IFN-γ release upon co-culturing of CAR T cells and CD19+ target 
cells. Since the percentage distribution of naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effector T cell 
subsets was comparable in both CD19 CAR T cell products. Although the potential reason for the lack of 
correlation between transduction efficiency and IFN-γ release when comparing CD19 CAR T cells 
manufactured with both processes was not clarified, it is not considered necessary to repeat the non-clinical 
in vitro data with KTE-C19 manufactured using the current CLP-2.2 process, since from a non-clinical point of 
view, comparability and/or equivalent performance has been sufficiently demonstrated between the products 
derived from the different processes. Moreover, IFN-γ release and cytotoxicity are also evaluated during 
manufacturing of KTE-C19 either for release of the final product (IFN-γ secretion) or during characterization 
studies (cytotoxicity). 
Overall, the provided non-clinical in vitro data sufficiently demonstrate specific activity of KTE-C19 against its 
target antigen CD19. In addition, the immunophenotypic analysis of the anti-human CD19 CAR T cells 
suggests that both transduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are present in the final product. Percentage 
distributions of naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effector T cell subsets varied between different 
donors. Moreover, the LuminexTM analysis demonstrated that all 17 tested analytes were specifically released 
by the CD19 CAR T cells when co-cultured with CD19+ target cells suggesting a certain poly-functionality of 
Assessment report

Page 33/127 
  
  
 
the CAR T cells at the end of the manufacturing process. Although these data are rather considered as 
characterization data of the final product than non-clinical pharmacology data, they are still important as they 
support the versatile capability of KTE-C19 with regard to lymphocyte activation, proliferation, trafficking and 
effector mechanisms.   
In addition to the in vitro evaluation of KTE-C19, a murine surrogate CD19 CAR T cells was established for in 
vivo evaluation in a syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. This approach provided important proof-of-concept 
for the overall design of the chosen CD19 CAR construct including for example the choice of the co-
stimulatory domain. Such a surrogate model may also be considered as the most appropriate non-clinical 
model for investigating the persistence of the CD19 CAR T cells and for evaluating potential on-target/off-
tumour effects of the CAR T cells. On the other hand, it is evident that crucial parameters of the CAR T cell 
may differ between the murine surrogate CD19 CAR T cells and the human CD19 CAR T cells. This includes 
for example the binding affinity of the scFv, the manufacturing of the transduced cells, the composition of T 
cell subsets, and the basal T cell activity which was observed in the murine surrogate only. Despite these 
expected differences, the use of murine surrogate CD19 CAR T cells in immunocompetent mice instead of 
testing KTE-C19 in immunocompromised mice is an acceptable approach that overcomes some of the 
limitations of the in vivo testing of KTE-C19 in immunocompromised animals, such as unspecific xenogeneic 
immune responses of KTE-C19 in mice or the lack of complex interactions of the CAR T cells with other 
components of the immune system. Since both models do have clear, although differing, limitations with 
regard to the translation of the non-clinical pharmacology data to human, additional non-clinical in vivo 
pharmacology data (e.g. testing of KTE-C19 in immunocompromised animals transplanted with human CD19+ 
tumour cells) would not add significant value to the available non-clinical and clinical pharmacology data sets. 
The provided non-clinical pharmacokinetic investigations focused on the in vivo persistence of the murine 
surrogate CAR T cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, which is acceptable for this type of product. 
The chosen model provides all necessary stimuli that are considered important for a specific activation, 
expansion, and survival of the CD19 CAR T cells (e.g. CD19+ target tumour cells, endogenous cytokines, 
chemokines and cellular interactions of a fully functional immune system).  Despite these ideal preconditions, 
the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells could only be detected in spleen at Day 8, but no longer at Day 63 post-
infusion (Kochenderfer et al., 2010a) probably CAR T cells may have persisted in tissues such as bone 
marrow, but remained undetectable by the method used; or despite limited persistence, CAR T cell 
engraftment was sufficient to eradicate lymphoma and induce long-lasting B-cell aplasia during the 
observation period in the animal model. 
YESCARTA comprises engineered human T-cells, therefore there are no representative in vitro assays, ex 
vivo models, or in vivo models that can accurately address the toxicological characteristics of the human 
product. Hence, traditional toxicology studies used for drug development were not performed. 
Instead the on-target/off-tumour effect on normal B cells was confirmed during the pharmacology studies in 
the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. This effect on normal B cells was expected based on the expression 
pattern of CD19 and resulting B cell aplasia has been observed in both the syngeneic mouse lymphoma 
model and in study participants that were treated with KTE-C19 in clinical trials. Other toxic effects of anti-
murine CD19 CAR T cells were not evident in the mouse lymphoma model. However, off-target toxicities are 
also not expected to be reliably detected in the surrogate mouse model, since off-target recognition of other 
antigens may differ between the anti-human and anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells due to the different scFvs 
that were used in the CD19 CAR constructs. Similarly, the use of KTE-C19 in immunocompromised mice 
would also not be expected to reliably predict off-target effects, since potential differences of cross-
recognition of unrelated antigens, differences of antigen expression patterns, and differences in the in vivo 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 34/127 
  
  
survival, activation and expansion of KTE-C19 are expected to hamper detection of potential off-target effects 
in such a model. 
In addition to the potential toxicities of the CD19 CAR T cells that are either dependent on the expression 
pattern of the chosen target antigen (on-target/off-tumour toxicities) or on the cross-reactivity of the chosen 
ScFv with other non-target antigens (off-target toxicities), there are also expected risk that are associated 
with the general mode of action of CAR T cells, such as uncontrolled T cell proliferation, tumour lysis 
syndrome (TRS), cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). These toxic 
effects cannot be investigated in non-clinical studies as they are general effects of CAR T cells and the extent 
of expected toxicities are largely based on patient-specific parameters such as the individual tumour load.  
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of YESCARTA on fertility, reproduction and 
development. This is acceptable based on the type of product, the expression pattern of the target antigen 
and the lack of a relevant animal model. The risk of inadvertent germline transmission of the CD19 CAR 
construct has not been addressed; however, the Guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline 
transmission of gene transfer vectors (EMEA/273974/2005) indicates that the risk of germline transmission 
associated with the administration of genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and, as animal 
testing of human cells may be difficult or not meaningful, non-clinical germline transmission studies of human 
genetically modified cells are not recommended.  
It is not known if Yescarta has the potential to be transferred to the foetus.  Based on the mechanism of 
action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, including B-cell 
lymphocytopenia.  Therefore, Yescarta is not recommended for women who are pregnant, or for women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception.  Pregnant women should be advised on the potential risks to 
the foetus.  Assessment of immunoglobulin levels and B-cells in newborns of mothers treated with Yescarta 
should be considered. It is unknown whether it is excreted in human milk or transferred to the breast-feeding 
child.  Breast-feeding women should be advised of the potential risk to the breast-fed child.  
No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with Yescarta. The combination of both the 
use of a γ-retroviral vector with full-length viral LTRs and the high proliferative potential of the transduced T 
cells provides a certain risk of insertional oncogenesis which has previously been addressed in a Scientific 
Advice procedure. Literature data reported an exceptionally high resistance of mature mouse T cells against 
transformation induced by genomic integration of γ-retroviral vectors. Moreover, there were no reported 
cases of insertional oncogenesis (see Clinical Safety) of either KTE-C19 itself or T cells that were transduced 
with γ-retroviral vectors encoding other transgenes – and that is reassuring.  The experience so far with 
mouse and human T cells suggests that T cell transformation due to genomic integration of γ-retroviral 
vectors is, if at all, a very rare event. 
No formal pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been conducted. KTE-C19 comprises human 
autologous cells transduced with a retroviral vector containing an anti-CD19 CAR. As such, appropriate in 
vitro and in vivo models to assess potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions do not exist. CYP enzymes 
and other classically described metabolic pathways are not involved in the metabolism of cellular therapy. 
Potential risks for the environment associated with the clinical use of Yescarta are generation and 
transmission of replication competent retroviruses (RCRs), transmission of residual infectious retroviral vector 
particles, or transmission of genetically modified T-cells. From the environmental risk assessment it is 
concluded that these risks are negligible.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development package provided for KTE-C19 was limited due to the type of product and the 
limitations of animal models available for investigating pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity 
aspects of KTE-C19, but it was considered adequate. The presented non-clinical in vitro and in vivo data that 
address CD19 CAR expression on transduced T cells, specific activation of CD19 CAR T cells, the in vivo anti-
lymphoma activity and persistence of the surrogate CD19 CAR T cells, and B cell aplasia as an expected on-
target/off-tumour effect are considered sufficient.  
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusions on the non clinical aspects as described above.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
 The pharmacology results are focused on data from patients treated in NCI 09-C-00082 and ZUMA-1 studies 
NCI 09-C-0082: 
The 13 subjects from this study comprise a group similar to the ZUMA-1 population with respect to disease 
characteristics  (refractory  DLBCL,  PMBCL,  or  TFL),  conditioning  chemotherapy  regimen  received  (low  dose), 
anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  characteristics  (cryopreserved  cells  manufactured  with  the  same  retroviral  vector  and 
anti-CD19 construct), and target dose (2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg for all subjects in ZUMA-1 and 6/7 
subjects in NCI 09-C-0082).  
Pharmacokinetics of anti-CD19 CAR T cells were assessed by means of measuring the presence, expansion, 
and  persistence  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  at  approximately  7  days  (+/-3),  14  days  (+/-3),  4  weeks  (±  2 
weeks), 3 months (± 1 month), and 6 months (± 1 month) after cell infusion.  
Serial blood samples were taken after cell infusion and subjected to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(qPCR)  test  using  a  method  developed  at  the  NCI  (Kochenderfer  et  al,  2015).  The  absolute  number  of 
persisting anti-CD19 CAR T cells per microliter (μL) of blood was based on the percentage of anti-CD19 CAR-
expressing cells in the product as determined by flow cytometry (see supplemental methods of publications 
by Kochenderfer and colleagues [Kochenderfer et al, 2012; Kochenderfer et al, 2015]), with normalization to 
expression  of  the  housekeeping  gene  β-actin  and  to  the  absolute  number  of  mononuclear  blood  cells  to 
derive a final value of CAR positive cells/μL of blood.

In  the  cohorts  11-14  with  cryopreserved  CAR-T  cells  used,  all  13  evaluable  subjects  had  measurable  anti-
CD19 CAR T-cells in blood at Day 7 and/or Day 14. Across all subjects, the median values at Days 7, 14, and 
28  were  33  cells/μL,  13  cells/μL,  and  1  cell/μL,  respectively.  The  median  peak  value  across  all  subjects 
(Cmax) was 86 cells/μL (range: 6 to 294 cells/μL). Due to the small sample size no correlation with efficacy 
and safety variables was conducted. 
ZUMA-1 phase 1/2: 
Anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels  were  measured  in  the  blood  of  subjects  enrolled  in  Phase  2  Cohorts  1  and  2 
combined.  The  presence,  expansion,  and  persistence  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  were  monitored  in  blood  by 
quantitative  polymerase  chain  reaction  (qPCR)  analysis  at  various  time  points  before  and  after  infusion  of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel. Similarly, levels of circulating cytokines were assessed at multiple time points before 
and after conditioning chemotherapy and infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. In addition, normal B-cell levels 
were evaluated in blood by flow cytometry to monitor the on-target and off-tumour effect of anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells. 
Results  of  the  primary  analysis  showed  that  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  were  measurable  in  peripheral  blood 
within the first 14 days after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion in all evaluable subjects. Anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells exhibited an initial rapid expansion with a median time to peak level of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood of 
8  days  (range:  8.0  to  78.0  days,  with  one  outlier)  after  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  infusion.  The  median  peak 
level  across  all  subjects  (maximum  observed  plasma  concentration  [Cmax])  was  41.9  cells/μL  (range:  0.8, 
1513.7cells/μL).  Levels  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  decreased  toward  background  levels  by  3  months  of  the 
infusion  (range:  0  to  15.8  cells/μL),  but  were  measurable  at  the  last  assessment  in  most  evaluable  (i.e., 
responding) patients. The median area under the blood concentration vs time curve (AUC) from Day 0 to Day 
28 (AUC0-28) was 462.3 cells/μL days. 
Results  were  similar  in  the  analysis  performed  at  12  months  of  follow-up.    In  overall,  Peak  levels  of  anti-
CD19 CAR T cells occurred within the first 8-15 days after YESCARTA infusion.  The median peak level of anti-
CD19 CAR T cells in the blood (C max) were 38.3 cells/µL (range: 0.8-1513.7 cells/μL), which decreased to a 
median  of  2.1  cells/µL  by  1  month  (range: 0-167.4 cells/μL)  and  to  a  median  of  0.4  cells/µL  by  3  months 
(range 0-28.4 cells/μL) after YESCARTA infusion.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  number  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  in  blood  was  positively  associated  with  objective  response  including 
both  CR  and  PR.  Subjects  who  had  an  objective  response  had  higher  levels  (peak  and  AUC  at  1  month)  of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells compared to non-responders. Levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells were not assessed after 
disease  progression,  which  limits  the  ability  to  correlate  long-term  cell  persistence  and  DOR.  The  median 
peak anti-CD19 peak levels in responders (n=55) were 4 times higher than the corresponding level in non-
responders (n= 28)(45.6 cells/μL vs 11.4 cells/μL). Median AUC levels in subjects with CR or PR were 5 times 
higher than the corresponding level in non-responders (562.0 days*cells/µL vs. 103.3 days*cells/µL,). 
Higher  peak  levels  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels  were  found  to  be  associated  with  the  occurrence  of 
neurologic events, but not with CRS. 
Pharmacokinteic correlations were similar for response according to the central assesment. The number of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood was positively associated with objective response (CR or PR).  The median 
anti-CD19 CAR T cell Cmax levels in responders (n=73) were 205% higher compared to the corresponding 
level in nonresponders (n=23) (43.6 cells/μL vs 21.2 cells/μL).  Median AUCDay 0 - 28 in responding patients

(n=73) was 251% of the corresponding level in nonresponders (n=23) (557.1 days × cells/μL vs. 222.0 days

Age and gender 
No difference could be observed for covariates such as age and gender in terms of PK parameters.  
Race  
There was a limited sample size of Asian patients (N=3). Both the CAR-T-cell peak and the AUC are much 
higher in asians compared to the group of whites (n=87) and others (n=11). However, it should be noted 
that the sample size for Asian subjects is very small. 
The median CAR-T cell peak and the AUC of the white patients (n=87) were comparable with those of 
“others” (n=11), while the CAR-T cell peak of the asians was about 20 times and the AUC 10 times/ 16 times 
higher compared to both other groups. However, it should be noted that the sample size for non-white 
subjects is small. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK drug interaction studies have been conducted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
In ZUMA-1 phase 2 (cohort 1+2), 27 subjects (27%) were treated with steroids, 43 subjects (43%) were 
treated with tocilizumab, 25 subjects (25%) were treated with steroids and tocilizumab, 17 subjects (17%) 
were treated with vasopressors, and 6 subjects (6%) were treated with immunoglobulins. In Zuma-1 the 
expansion of anti-CD19 CAR T-cells was not diminished in subjects who received tocilizumab or steroids 
compared with those who did not. The median peak level of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells was higher in subjects 
who received tocilizumab/steroids (61.1 and 49.7 cells/μL respectively) versus subjects who did not received 
tocilizumab/steroids (26.5 and 32.2 cells/μL respectively). Levels (peak and AUC at 1 month) of anti-CD19 
CAR T-cells, objective response rate, and the PFS rate at 6 months were similar in subjects who received 
reactive tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids compared to those who did not.

No specific mechanism of action studies have been conducted. 
Chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)  T-cell  therapy  is  a  type  of  immunotherapy  that  involves  autologous  or 
allogeneic T-cells engineered to express CARs directed against tumour-associated antigens.  
KTE-C19 is a form of autologous CAR T-cell therapy directed against CD19, the surface antigen expressed in 
DLBCL  and  other  aggressive  B-cell  lymphomas.  The  structure  of  the  anti-CD19  CAR  construct  used  for 
production and the product’s mechanism of action are shown below.

coupled  to  the  costimulatory  signalling  domain  CD28  and  the  zeta  chain  of  the  T-cell  receptor  (TCR)/CD3 
complex  (CD3  zeta),  activates  the  downstream  signalling  cascades  that  lead  to  activation,  proliferation, 
cytokine production and acquisition of effector functions, such as cytotoxicity.

Primary and secondary pharmacology  
NCI 09-C-0082 
Up  to  44  biomarkers  were  evaluated  in  serum  samples  in  NCI  09-C-0082.  Levels  of  homeostatic, 
inflammatory/regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune effector molecules peaked sequentially within 7 
days after treatment, in parallel with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion, and generally resolved to near baseline 
levels within 2 to 3 weeks after infusion. The tumour samples have been analysed for CD19 expression in NCI 
study (per inclusion criteria).   
Levels  of  homeostatic,  inflammatory/regulatory  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  immune  effector  molecules 
peaked  sequentially  within  7  days  after  treatment,  in  parallel  with  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  expansion,  and 
generally  resolved  to  near  baseline  levels  within  2  to  3  weeks  after  infusion.  Nine  of  the  11  key  analytes 
showed increases of more than 2-fold over baseline in ≥ 30% of subjects.  
Table 3: Incidence of ≥ 2-fold Increases in Selected Serum Cytokines at Peak and Last Visit 
ZUMA-1 phase 1 /2 
Forty-four  (44)  analytes  (including  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  effector-related  markers)  were  evaluated  in 
serum  samples  at  the  following  time  points:  prior  to  conditioning  chemotherapy,  prior  to  axicabtagene  
ciloleucel infusion, and at various time points after the infusion, up to Day 28. These analytes encompass a 
panel  of  homeostatic, inflammatory,  and  immune modulating  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  immune  effector–
related  markers.  Several  cytokines  were  observed  to  increase  after  infusion  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel, 
peaking  within  14  days  of  infusion  and  generally  decreasing  towards  the  baseline  levels  within  1  month. 
Notably,  IL-15  was  induced  following  conditioning  chemotherapy,  whereas  all  other  cytokines  were  induced 
following the cell infusion. IFN-Gamma  was  not induced following conditioning chemotherapy, but showed a 
meaningful increase following the cell infusion from 7.5 pg/mL (7.5, 1876.0) to 477.4 (7.5, 8209.2). Analyses 
performed to identify associations between cytokine levels and incidence of CRS or neurologic events showed 
that  higher  levels  (peak  and  AUC  at  1  month)  of  IL-15,  as  well  as  IL-6,  were  associated  with  Grade  3  or 
higher neurologic events and Grade 3 or higher CRS (please refer to clinical safety).

The  tumour  samples  have  been  analysed  for  CD19  expression  in  ZUMA-1  study  (retrospective  analysis).  In 
view of secondary pharmacology, B-cells were counted at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months after the 
infusion  of  Yescarta  to  identify  b-cell  aplasia  as  on-target  off-tumour  toxicity.  Undetectable  B  cells  were 
defined by B-cell counts based on the lower limit of detection for the assay, with a cut-off of B cell count < 61 
B cells/μL (Kochenderfer, 2012). B-cell aplasia was assessed among evaluable Phase 1 and Phase 2 subjects 
using a qualified flow cytometry assay on cryopreserved subject PBMCs. B-cell aplasia was defined as B cells 
<  lower  limit  of  quantitation  (LLOQ,  defined  as  CD19+,  CD20+,  or  double  positive  for  CD19+  and  CD20+

events  <  0.017  B  cells  as  a  percentage  of  viable  leukocytes,  with  10000  or  more  viable  leukocyte  events 
acquired  in  the  assay.  Baseline  samples  were  taken  prior  to  conditioning  chemotherapy  and  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion.  At  baseline  (n  =  80  subjects),  48  subjects  (60%)  had  no detectable  B  cells,  28  subjects 
(35%) had detectable B cells, and 4 subjects (5%) were not determined due to a low event count. At Month 
3 (n = 84 subjects), 65 subjects (77%) had no detectable B cells, 16 subjects (19%) had detectable B cells, 
and 3 subjects (4%) were not determined due to a low event count.  
At  Month  6  (n  =  23  subjects),  19  subjects  (83%)  had  no  detectable  B  cells,  and  4  subjects  (17%)  had 
detectable B cells. At Month 9 (n = 5 subjects), 5 subjects (100%) had no detectable B cells.  
At Month 15 (n = 2), 2 subjects (100%) had no detectable B cells. 
Additionally,  8  subjects  (10%)  in  Cohort  1  and  11  subjects  (11%)  in  Cohort  1  and  2  combined  had 
experienced  Grade  1  or  2  hypogammaglobulinaemia;  6  of  these  subjects  received  immunoglobulins  as 
treatment for the hypogammaglobulinaemia during the hospitalization period. In addition, 1 subject received 
immunoglobulins for treatment of hypogammaglobulinaemia after the hospitalization period. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Results  from  the  NCI  09-C-0082  and  ZUMA-1  showed  that  peak  levels  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  occurred 
within  the  first  7-14  days  after  YESCARTA  infusion.  In  the  primary  analysis  of  ZUMA-1  Phase  2,  he  median 
peak  level  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  in  the  blood  (Cmax)  were  41.9  cells/µL  (range:  0.8  -  1513.7  cells/μL), 
which decreased to a median of 2.1 cells/µL by 1 month (range 0 - 167.4 cells/μL) and to a median of  0.4 
cells/µL by 3 months (range 0 - 15.8 cells/μL) after YESCARTA infusion .   
The levels of anti-CD 19 declined by day 28 and declined to near background levels within 3 months.  
The extent of T cell expansion does not appear to be related to the total dose of CAR-T cells with respect to 
one patient within NCI-09-C-0082 who received a higher dose (6 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T-cells/kg instead of 2 
x 106 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells/kg). 
The number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood was positively associated with objective response (CR or PR) 
based on the central assessment and the 12-month update.  .  The median anti-CD19 CAR T cell Cmax levels 
in responders (n=73) were 205% higher compared to the corresponding level in nonresponders (n=23) (43.6 
cells/μL vs 21.2 cells/μL).  Median AUCDay 0 - 28 in responding patients (n=73) was 251% of the corresponding 
level in nonresponders (n=23) (557.1 days × cells/μL vs. 222.0 days × cells/μL). 
Patients who had co-medication with steroids (n=26) and tocilizumab (n=43) showed increased Cmax and 
AUC-level. For the other covariates such as gender, age, race and tumour burden no significant impact on the 
pharmacokinetics became evident.  
Several product characteristics of axicabtagene ciloleucel were studied in association with treatment 
outcomes:  percent transduction, ex vivo IFN-γ production in a co-culture assay, as well as the percentage of 
product T-cell subsets (based on CCR7, CD45RA, CD4, and CD8 expression determined by flow cytometry; 
and total number of T cells or anti-CD19 CAR T cells infused). Given a limited sample size and exploratory 
nature of analyses, the results should be taken with caution, product characteristics did not appear to be 
predictive of efficacy outcomes. As to safety, interestingly the provided data suggests that products which 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 45/127 
  
  
 
 
contain increased numbers of more differentiated T cells (Tcm, Tem and Teff) may be associated with higher 
probability of Grade 3 or higher CRS (See RMP). 
In the NCI study, four of the five CRs had long-term durability with durations of remission of 56, 51, 44, and 
38 months. CRs continued after recovery of non-malignant polyclonal B cells in three of four patients with 
long-term complete remissions without detectable levels of anti CD-19 CAR T-cells in the blood. 
One subject in the study NCI 09-C0082 with ongoing CR who received a dose of 1 x 106 cells/kg had 
detectable anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at the last visit on Day 125 while other subjects with ongoing CRs had no 
detectable anti-CD19 CAR T- cells in the blood.  
The results in regard to temporary relationship between persistence of CAR-T cells and B-cell aplasia have 
been provided for both NCI and ZUMA-1 studies. A decline in the number of subjects with detectable anti-
CD19 CAR T cells was associated with an increase in the number of subjects with detectable B cells over 
time, indirectly indicating target engagement. Starting from month 9, about 20% of subjects do not have 
detectable CAR-T cells but experience B-cell recovery.  In addition, an increase  over time was observed in a 
subset of subjects who had undetectable anti-CD19 CAR T cells together with detectable B cells.  Notably, a 
subset of subjects across all time points evaluated to date, had both  detectable anti-CD19 CAR T cells and 
detectable B cells, albeit at very low levels. No data in regard to functional characteristics of persisting anti-
CD19 CAR-T cells are available to date. 
Demonstration of CD19 expression was not required for study eligibility, as the restricted expression of CD19 
to  both  normal  and  most  malignant  B-cells  to  be  well  established  by  literature.  The  retrospective  tissue 
analysis  revealed  that  92 %  of  enrolled  patients  were  CD19  positive.  Of  note,  5/9  patients  with  a  negative 
IHC-signal  were  responder.  Reasons  for  potentially  false-negative  treatment  results  were  degradation  of 
CD19-antigen  over  time  and  a  lower  detection  CD19-detection  level  in  heterogenous  tumours  compared  to 
homogenous,  which  are  acknowledged.  Overall,  there  was  no  overt  relationship  between  the  dose  of  anti-
CD19 CAR+ T cells and their expansion and persistence in the peripheral blood. Likewise, to date, there was 
no apparent relationship between the anti-CD19 CAR+ T cell dose, the anti-CD19 CAR+ T cell persistence in 
the blood, and the clinical response or the toxicities related to this therapy, respectively. 
The prophylactic use of systemic steroids is not recommended as it may interfere with the activity of Yescarta 
(see section 4.2. of the SmPC). 
The pharmacodynamics of ZUMA-1 phase 2 may support the median time to peak level of anti-CAR-T-cells in 
blood after drug infusion. However, the comparative analysis between responder vs. non-responder showed, 
that biomarker such as IFN-Gamma or IL-15 were not positively correlated with the treatment outcome, 
neither for the depth nor for the duration of response. There is currently no evidence of a positive correlation 
between certain biomarkers such as IFN-Gamma and IL-15 and a positive treatment outcome (See discussion 
on clinical efficacy and RMP). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments were based on the known mechanism of action of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cell and the current knowledge of the safety profile of the conditioning chemotherapy and 
anti-CD19 CAR T-cell infusion.  
Clinical pharmacology data with Yescarta are considered sufficient to support the MAA.  
The CHMP endorsed the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as described

above.  
Clinical efficacy 
 Introduction 
The Applicant has submitted one key phase II study (ZUMA-1 phase 2), one retrospective global patient-level 
pooled study (Scholar-1), supportive phase I study (Zuma-1 phase 1), and study NCI-09-C-0082. Since the 
efficacy  results  of  ZUMA-1  phase  2  are  to  be  compared  with  the  results  of  Scholar-1,  both  studies  are 
considered as main studies and studies ZUMA-1 phase 1 and NCI-09-C-0082 as supportive. 
The current submission does not include subjects enrolled in Phase 2 Cohort 3 because enrollment into 
Cohort 3 was initiated in September 2016 and results from this cohort will be described separately. 
2.4.6.  Dose response studies 
NCI 09-C-0082: 
Dosing  of  the  conditioning  chemotherapy  agents  and  Yescarta  was  based  on  the  results  NCI  study  09-C-
0082,  a  Phase  1  open  label  study  of  the  safety  and  feasibility  of  anti-CD  19  CAR  T-cells  in  subjects  with 
advanced B-cell malignancies.  
Because  previous  studies  have  shown  an  association  between  adequate  lymphodepletion  and  adoptively 
transferred  T-cell  expansion  and  function  in  animal  models,  lymphodepletion  was  included  for  all  subjects. 
The  NCI  protocol  underwent  numerous  amendments  that  altered  the  doses  of  conditioning  chemotherapy 
agents, post infusion IL-2, and anti-CD19 CAR T-cells.  
A  total  of  14  cohorts  were  enrolled.  Cohorts  1  through  10  used  fresh  cells.  Cohorts  1  through  9  used  high 
doses  of  cyclophosphamide  (60  mg/kg  or  30  mg/kg  for  2  days)  and  fludarabine  (25  mg/m2  for  5  days)  as 
conditioning  chemotherapy  and  high  doses  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cells  (3.0  ×  106  cells/kg  to  3.0  ×  107 
cells/kg). 
Cohorts  11-14  used  cryopreserved  cells.  Cohorts  11  and  12  were  planned  to  use  the  same  conditioning 
chemotherapy as Cohort 10; the target anti-CD19 CAR T-cell doses were increased to 2 x 106 cells/kg and 6 
x 106 cells/kg, respectively, to assess the potential need for higher doses of the cryopreserved cell product. 
Cohorts  13  and  14  explored  a  cyclophosphamide  dose  of  500  mg/m2  for  3  days,  with  the  same  doses  of 
fludarabine and anti-CD19 CAR T-cell as used in Cohort 11. The subjects enrolled in Cohorts 11, 12, 13, and 
14 represent a group similar to study ZUMA-1 with respect to disease status and treatment. 
ZUMA-1 phase 1 
Based  on  the  response  and  safety  observations  described  above  for  the  NCI study  and  the  need to  achieve 
adequate  lymphodepletion  and  therapeutic  levels  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cells  without  intolerable  toxicity,  the 
ZUMA-1  study  used  a  regimen  of  cyclophosphamide  500  mg/m2  dose  and  fludarabine  30  mg/m2  given 
concurrently  for  3  days  and  a  target  Yescarta  dose  of  2  ×  106  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells/kg.  For  subjects 
weighing > 100 kg, the Yescarta dose was fixed to 2 x 108 cells.  
The Phase 1 of ZUMA-1 planned for alternatively reducing conditioning chemotherapy regimens and Yescarta 
doses if the initial dosing was not well tolerated. The DLT definition in the KTE-C19-101 study was applied to 
the NCI study (09-C-0082; IND 13871) data in group 3.

Seven subjects were treated in Phase 1. Six subjects were evaluable for toxicity per protocol, and 1 of the 6 
subjects experienced dose-limiting toxicities (Grade 4 encephalopathy on Day 1 and Grade 4 CRS on Day 6, 
comprising acute kidney injury, left ventricular failure, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension). On Day 16, the 
subject developed Grade 5 AE of intracranial haemorrhage.  
Additional  safety  precautions  were  adopted  in  the  protocol  following  these  events.  The  safety  review  team 
considered the Phase 1 regimen to be tolerable; therefore, the same doses of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, 
and anti-CD19 CAR T-cells were employed in Phase 2. 
2.4.7.  Main study: ZUMA-1 phase 2 :  
Methods 
This was a single-arm, multicenter study and evaluated the use of a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
in adult patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which includes 
those  patients  with  refractory  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL),  primary  mediastinal  B-cell  lymphoma 
(PMBCL)  and  transformed  follicular  lymphoma  (TFL).  All  patients  had  histologically  confirmed  aggressive  B-
cell NHL based on the WHO-classification of 2008.

the eligibility criteria prior to the leukapheresis. For Phase 2, after a subject commenced leukapheresis, the 
subject was considered enrolled into the study. 
Leukapheresis and Cell processing 
Investigative sites were instructed to perform leukapheresis per local requirements and follow the instrument 
operator’s manual.  A minimum of were to be processed with a goal of obtaining approximately.  The bag 
containing leukapheresed cells was to be placed into a shipping container for transport at 1°C to 10°C to the 
manufacturing facility. Upon receipt, each subject’s respective leukapheresed product was. T cells in the 
PBMC fraction were then activated. The monocytes in the PBMC preparation present the to T cells, resulting 
in crosslinking of the T-cell receptor complex and downstream signaling.  This activation process renders the 
T cells permissive for transduction.  This population of stimulated T cells was then transduced with a 
retroviral vector that is manufactured in a GMP process to introduce the CAR gene (Lu et al, 2016).  
Chemotherapy 
Subjects were to receive a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and 
fludarabine in order to induce lymphocyte depletion and create an optimal environment for expansion of KTE-
C19 in vivo.  
Objectives 
Primary Objective for Zuma Phase II was to evaluate the efficacy of KTE-C19, as measured by objective 
response rate in subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL. 
Secondary Objective for cohorts 1 and 2 were to assess safety and tolerability of KTE-C19 and additional 
efficacy endpoints.  
Secondary Objective specific to cohort 3 was to assess the impact of a prophylactic regimen on the rate of 
CRS and neurotoxicity and to assess the change in EQ-5D scores from baseline to Month 6. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
Phase 1: Incidence of adverse events defined as dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).  
Phase 2: Objective response rate (ORR), defined as a CR or PR per the revised International Working Group 
(IWG) Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007) as determined by study investigators.  All 
subjects who did not meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis cut-off date were considered 
non-responders. 
Secondary Endpoints (for Phase 2): 
•  ORR according to the central review, based on the IWG 2007 criteria (Cheson et al, 2007), defined as the 
proportion of subjects with either a CR or PR while on study. The best overall response for each subject 
was based on the assessments of response (CR, PR, SD, PD, not evaluable [NE], and not done [ND]). 
•  Duration of Response (DOR) according to the investigator’s assessment, and by central review, both 
based on IWG 2007 criteria (Cheson et al, 2007), defined as the time from the first objective response to 
disease progression or death due to disease relapse or drug-related toxicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 52/127 
  
  
•  Progression Free Survival (PFS) according to the investigator’s assessment, and by central review, both 
based on IWG 2007 criteria (Cheson et al, 2007), defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion date to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. 
•  Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion to the date of death 
from any cause. 
•  Safety:  Incidence of AEs, significant laboratory abnormalities, and presence of RCR or antibodies to 
FMC63 or bovine serum albumin in subjects’ blood. 
Subjects had their first post KTE-C19 infusion planned PET-CT tumour assessment 4 weeks following the 
KTE-C19 infusion, every 3 months during the post treatment until 24 moths, with no further imaging in long 
term follow-up portion of the study. In addition to the investigators assessment, PET-CT scans of all subjects 
evaluated for disease response for phase 2 had to be submitted to and reviewed by an independent central 
reviewer. For subjects who discontinued the study due to an assessment of progressive disease which was 
not subsequently confirmed by a central radiology reviewer, any additional imaging data, subsequent to the 
image in question will be submitted to the central reviewer to confirm disease response.  
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy had to be performed in subjects who are being assessed for CR. Per the 
revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007), a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 
should be performed only when the subject had bone marrow involvement with lymphoma prior to therapy or 
if new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood smear cause clinical suspicion of bone marrow 
involvement with lymphoma after treatment. 
Response assessment requirements were per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
(Cheson 2007). 
Sample size 
For Phase 1, a 6 + 3 design was used which has at least 50% probability to detect AEs with 33% incidence or 
greater and was deemed to have an adequately high probability of stopping in the presence of DLT while 
minimizing subjects exposed. Approximately 6-24 subjects with DLBCL, PMBCL or TFL were planned to be 
enrolled to evaluate the safety of KTE-C19 regimens. 
Planned enrolment was approximately 72 subjects for Phase 2 Cohort 1 (DLBCL) and at least 20 subjects for 
Phase 2 Cohort 2 (PMBCL and TFL). The single-arm design was planned to test for an improvement in ORR in 
Cohort 1 and in Cohorts 1 and 2 combined relative to a historical control rate. Given the sample size and 
taking multiplicity into account (see Statistical Methods), Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2 had at least 90% power 
with a 1-sided alpha of 0.025 to distinguish between an active therapy with a true response rate of 40% 
when compared with a therapy with a response rate of 20% or less.   
Randomisation 
Not applicable. This is a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. The study was an open-label study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 53/127 
  
  
Statistical methods 
The statistical hypothesis was that the ORR for subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in cohorts 1 and 
2 is significantly greater than 20%.  
No hypothesis will be tested in cohort 3. Cohort 3 is designed to estimate the response rate in relapsed / 
refractory transplant ineligible DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL. 
Analysis sets 
The protocol specified 2 analysis sets for phase I (safety phase), a DLT evaluable set (patients who received 
the target and were followed for at least 30 days or patients who received a dose of anti-CD19 CAR+ T cells 
lower than the target for that cohort and experienced a DLT during the 30 day post-infusion period), and a 
safety set (all subjects treated with any dose of KTE-C19). For ORR, a mITT set as defined for phase II will be 
used. 
For phase II, the protocol specified 3 analysis sets, i.e. 
- 
- 
- 
a modified intent to treat set (mITT) consisting of all subjects enrolled and treated with KTE-C19 at a 
dose of at least 1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR+ T cells/kg 
a safety set consisting of all subjects treated with any dose of KTE-C19 
the full analysis set (FAS) consisting of all enrolled (all leukapheresed) subjects (otherwise described 
as ITT). 
The primary analysis of efficacy used the mITT set. The FAS was used for sensitivity analyses.  
Methods 
For the primary endpoint the objective response rate with exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals was to be 
computed. For cohorts 1 and cohorts 1 and 2 combined, an exact binomial test was to be used to compare 
the observed response rates to a response rate of 20%.  
For the duration of response, a competing-risk analysis method (Pepe 1991, Fine and Gray 1999) was to be 
used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse. The cumulative incidence of relapse in the presence of 
non-disease related mortality (the competing risk) will be estimated along with 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals at 3-month intervals. Kaplan-Meier estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be used 
for PFS and OS. Landmark analyses at 3 months intervals were to be provided for survival endpoints. 
Multiplicity and timing of analyses 
Alpha splitting according to Song and Chi (2007) and Wang et al (2007) was defined in order to control the 
overall type 1 error at 0.025 (one-sided) for testing of cohort 1 and the combined cohorts 1+2. 
Consequently, a significance level of 0.022 was used for cohort 1, and 0.0075 for cohorts 1+2. In order to 
control the type 1 error maximum patient numbers per cohort were conservatively assumed. In cohort 1, two 
interim analyses were planned. One interim analysis for futility was planned after 20 subjects with 3 months 
follow-up data in the mITT set. A second interim analysis for efficacy was planned after 50 subjects with 3 
months follow-up in the mITT set. The final analysis was planned after 72 subjects with 6 months follow-up. 
A Pocock boundary of the of the Lan-DeMets family of alpha spending functions was pre-specified for the 
efficacy interim analysis leading to a nominal significance level of 0.017 in the second interim analysis and 
0.011 in the final analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 54/127 
  
  
The primary analysis of cohorts 1 and 2 combined was planned to be performed when additional 20 subjects 
in the mITT set of cohort 2 have had the opportunity to be evaluated for response at 6 months after the 
target KTE-C19 infusion.

Recruitment 
ZUMA-1 phase 2 was conducted at 24 sites (23 in the US and 1 in Israel). While the data cut-off for primary 
analysis was 27th January 2017 with follow up-data through 11 Aug 2017, a long-term follow up of 15 years 
for those patients in response was foreseen. 
Of 111 enrolled and leukapherized patients, 101 received the IMP: 77 patients with DLBCL in cohort 1 and 24 
patients with either TFL or PMBCL in cohort 2. Of the 10 patients who failed to receive the product, one was 
due  to  manufacturing  failure.  The  further  9  patients  were  not  treated  due  to  progressive  disease,  serious 
adverse reactions following leukapharesis or chemotherapy or due to undetectable disease.

The median time from leukapheresis to product delivery was 17 days (range: 14 to 51 days) and the median 
time from leukapheresis to infusion was 23 days (range: 15 to 72 days). The median dose was 2.0x 106 CAR-
positive T cells/kg (range 1.1 to 2.2 x106 cells/kg). 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 5 times and a total of 19 deviations were reported for 17 subjects (17%; 14 
subjects  in  Cohort 1  and 3  subjects  in  Cohort  2).  The  most  frequently  occurring  relevant  protocol  deviation 
(11  subjects)  was  baseline  positron  emission  tomography–computed  tomography  (PET-CT)  not  performed 
within 28 days of conditioning chemotherapy. In these patients, the baseline scan was done between day -29 
and  -41  days  relative  to  conditioning  chemotherapy.  None  of  these  patients  received  anti-cancer  therapy 
during the interval. Steroid infusion within 5 days prior to treatment with Yescarta, which applied for one of 
the 11 patients, is not considered to bias the efficacy data.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint (superiority of ORR compared to a historic control ORR of 20%) was met in Phase 2 for 
Cohort  1  at  the  second  interim  analysis  and  subsequently  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  combined:  In  the  interim 
analysis  51  patients  with  3  months  minimum  follow-up  were  assessed.  The  ORR  among  these  patients  was 
76 % (95% CI: 63%, 87%), p <0.0001.  In the inferential analysis for the combined cohorts in 92 subjects 
who  were  followed  for  6  months,  the  ORR  was  82%  (95%  CI:  72%,  89%),  P  <  0.0001,  with  52%  CR  rate 
and 29% PR rate.  
Additionally, ORR among all 101 subjects treated in Phase 2 was 83% (95% CI: 74%, 90%), with a CR rate 
of 58%. The ORR among all 101 subjects based on central review was 72% (95% CI: 62%, 81%), with a CR 
rate of 51%, respectively. ORR in all 111 enrolled patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 was 77% (95% CI: 69%, 85%) 
with a CR rate of 55% per local investigator and 66% (95% CI: 56%, 75%) with a CR rate 47% per central 
reviewer (see Table below).

assessment in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
The  median  DOR  based  on  the  central  review  was  14.0  months  (95%  CI:  8.3,  NE)  in  the  mITT  set.  An 
ongoing  response  at  the  data-cut-off  was  observed  for  38  subjects.  Three  subjects  in  Cohorts  1  and  2 
combined  underwent  allogeneic  SCT  while in  a  response  after treatment  with axicabtagene  ciloleucel;  these 
subjects were not censored in the main analysis, but were censored in a sensitivity analysis. The median DOR 
in subjects who achieved a CR was not reached, the median follow-up time was 11.3 months.

Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (ZUMA-1) 
Study identifier 
 KTE-C19-101 
Design 
ZUMA-1 is a single-arm, non-randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 2 
study conducted to evaluate efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects 
with refractory aggressive forms of NHL, specifically DLBCL, PMBCL, and 
follicular lymphoma transformed to DLBCL (hereafter referred to as a 
transformed follicular lymphoma [TFL]).  
Subjects with refractory DLBCL were enrolled into Cohort 1 and subjects with 
refractory PMBCL or refractory TFL into Cohort 2. 
Key eligibility criteria were prior therapy including anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen; no central 
nervous system (CNS) lymphoma; no history of allogeneic SCT; no prior 
anti-CD19, CAR, or other genetically modified T-cell therapy.

Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
ZUMA-1 phase 2 is designed to differentiate between a treatment that has a 
true response rate of 20% or less and a treatment with a true response rate 
of 40% or more. The hypothesis is that the ORR to KTE-C19 in cohorts 1 and 
cohort 2combined is significantly greater than 20%

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Scholar-1 
SCHOLAR-1 is a patient pooled, retrospective analysis, which integrated data from 2 randomized Phase 3 
studies (LYSARC-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational databases (MD 
Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa Specialized Program of Research Excellence 
[SPORE]) of patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell 
lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL), with refractory defined as progressive 
disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) < 6 months as best response to last line of chemotherapy (≥ 4 cycles of 
first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapse ≤ 12 months after autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT).

Study participants  
The data set evaluated outcomes in patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary 
mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL), with refractory defined as 
progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) < 6 months as best response to last line of chemotherapy (≥ 
4 cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy) or relapse ≤ 12 months after autologous stem cell 
transplantation (ASCT).  
Among 861 patients, 636 were included based on the refractory search criteria.

refractory and had commenced the next line of systemic therapy for refractory disease.  Refractory disease 
was defined as one of the following:  PD as best response to any line of chemotherapy; SD as best response 
to ≥ 4 cycles of first-line or 2 cycles of later-line therapy; or relapse ≤ 12 months following ASCT.  Subjects 
must have received an anti-CD20 mAb, such as rituximab (unless disease was CD20–), and an anthracycline

as one of their prior regimens.  Subjects with central nervous system (CNS) disease,  and with year of 
diagnosis prior to 2000 were excluded.  Kite reviewed the abstraction results and programmatically identified 
the subset of subjects who could be documented to meet all elements of the refractory definition used. Upon 
abstraction, subjects were further classified into refractory category subgroups based on the first time in the 
treatment course that a subject met the criteria for refractory status.  These refractory category subgroups 
were primary refractory, refractory to second or later line therapy, and relapse ≤ 12 months of ASCT. 
Treatments 
All evaluated patients received standard-therapies. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
The primary objective is to estimate the RR and complete response rate among subjects with refractory 
DLBCL, TFL, and PMBCL when treated with salvage chemotherapy (currently available standard of care).  
These estimated RR from Scholar-1 should be compared with the ORR observed in the ZUMA-1 primary 
analysis. 
Secondary Objective: 
The secondary objective is to estimate overall survival among subjects with refractory DLBCL, TFL, and 
PMBCL when treated with salvage chemotherapy (with currently available standard of care). 
This estimated OS in patients with refractory DLBCL, TFL, and PMBCL in SCHOLAR-1 should be compared 
with OS of subjects in the ZUMA-1 primary analysis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The endpoints in SCHOLAR-1 were RR, complete response rate (CRR), and OS. 
For the 2 randomized studies included in SCHOLAR-1, response to therapy for refractory disease was 
according revised International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma as assessed 
by the investigator (hereafter referred to as IWG 1999 criteria). For the 2 retrospective databases, response 
was according to investigator assessment (assessment criteria not available).  Subjects were evaluable for 
response if they had been determined to be refractory, had commenced therapy for refractory disease, and 
had evidence of response assessment (a date of assessment and an assessment outcome other than ”Not 
Done”) after commencement of therapy.  The latter condition was included in order to avoid underestimating 
the response rate by the inclusion of subjects receiving only palliative care after the determination of 
refractory disease. Survival was measured from the commencement of treatment for refractory disease to 
death or date last known alive.  
Sample size 
No sample size calculations were performed. All patients eligible were analysed. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable as this was a retrospective single arm patient-level meta-analysis.

Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable as this was a retrospective single arm patient-level meta-analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The SCHOLAR-1 study serves as historic control. Higgin’s Q statistic (Higgins, 2002) was used to assess 
evidence of heterogeneity in response rate among institutions. If the p-value from this test was > 0.10, data 
from the 4 institutions were to be combined to estimate the RR and 95% CI. A random effects model 
(DerSimonian & Laird, 1986) was used to estimate the RR and CI, considering institution as a random effect. 
Summaries presented the RRs and 95% CIs by institution and based on the result of the Higgin’s Q test 
overall. OS was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. KM plots, the median survival time (95% CI), 
and the survival rate at 2 years was to be estimated by institution and overall in the survival analysis set. 
Results 
The  SCHOLAR-1  data  set  comprised  636  subjects  identified  from  a  total  pooled  population  of  861  subjects 
with  refractory  aggressive  B-cell  NHL  (DLBCL,  PMBCL,  and  TFL)  from  2  randomized  clinical  trials  and  3 
academic  center  databases,  who  correspond  to  the  ZUMA-1  population.  Based  on  the  Scholar-1-evaluable 
set, 636 were identified with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The majority of patients had DLBCL (88%) and a 
median  age  of  55  of  patients.  58%  had  a  history  of  primary  refractory  disease,  20%  received  the  salvage 
therapy  for  primary  refractory  disease,  62%  were  refractory  to  at least two  prior  lines  of  therapy  and  18% 
had a relapse after ASCT within 12 month. The primary analyses of response and OS comprised 523 subjects 
and 603 subjects, respectively.

Table 21 Response and CRRs 
The secondary endpoint was OS, DOR was not assessed. Among 603 subjects evaluable for OS, the median 
OS  was  6.3  months.  The,  6-month  and  1-  and  2-year  survival  rates  were  53%,  28%  and  20%.  Subgroup 
analyses of OS indicate that survival is poor in all evaluated subgroups. Consistent with the literature review, 
median  OS  was  less  than  10  months  in  all  subgroups  except  those  who  underwent  SCT  after  being 
determined to be refractory.  
Standardized analyses of response and survival were undertaken to address these potential imbalances. Two 
covariates were specified for use in the standardization: last refractory subgroup and the occurrence of SCT 
at any time after determination of refractory status. Results of the standardized analysis showed a RR of 20% 
(15%,  25%)  and  a  median  OS  of  3.9  months  in  SCHOLAR-1.  The  standardized  analyses  suggested  odds 
ratios  for  ZUMA-1:  SCHOLAR-1  of  approximately  3.8  for  RR  and  8  for  CR.  Standardized  analyses  of  OS 
showed 6-month and 1-year survival rates of 77% and 52%, respectively for subjects in ZUMA-1 compared 
with 35% and 17%, respectively, for subjects in SCHOLAR-1 and a 77% reduction in the overall risk of death 
for  subjects  in  ZUMA-1  relative  to  SCHOLAR-1.  These  standardized  results  are  considered  to  confirm  a 
response  rate  of  approximately  20%  for  subjects  with  refractory  aggressive  NHL  treated  with  currently 
available therapies and support the primary SCHOLAR analysis.

Exploratory endpoints 
One subject (1%) in Cohort 1 and 2 subjects (8%) in Cohort 2 underwent allogeneic SCT while in response (2 
in PR; 1 in CR) after axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment, and no subjects underwent ASCT after responding to 
the initial axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
A total of 9 subjects were retreated with Yescarta in Phase 2. Based on the investigator’s assessment, 5 of 9 
retreated subjects responded (2 CR and 3 PR) at Month 1. Analysis of duration of retreatment response 
(DORR) among the retreated subjects in Phase 2 showed a median DORR of 3.5 months as of the data cut-off 
date. Results were identical in a sensitivity analysis that excluded responses that occurred after ASCT 
following retreatment in 4 subjects. One subject underwent ASCT and 3 subjects underwent allogeneic SCT. 
Three of the 4 subjects underwent transplant while in response (2 in PR; 1 in CR). Two subjects were still in 
response at data cutoff, including 1 subject who had undergone allogeneic SCT. None of the subjects who 
were retreated converted from SD or PR to PR or CR. 
Change in tumour burden was measured by baseline SPD of selected nodes or lesions from baseline to the 
post-baseline nadir, per investigator measurements. The median percent change from baseline in SPD at 6 
months, 9 months, and 12 months were -87%, -92%, and -100%, respectively, in Cohorts 1 and 2 
combined; and -84%, -96%, and -100% for Cohort 1.

Thirteen  subjects  with  DLBCL,  TFL,  or  PMBCL  were  enrolled  in  Cohorts  11  through  14  and  received 
conditioning  chemotherapy  and  the  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cell  infusion.  In  the  NCI  study,  subjects  were  not 
followed  for  survival  after  disease  progression.  Six  subjects  withdrew  from  the  study;  4  had  disease 
progression, 1 withdrew consent, and 1 was withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion; 7 subjects remain in 
follow-up as of 10 Nov 2016. All but 1 subject treated in Cohorts 11 through 14 received 2 x 106 cells/kg (1 
subject  received  6  x  106  cells/kg  and  experienced  DLTs).  The  median  age  of  this  population  was  52  years 
(range: 29 to 68 years); most subjects (84.6%) were male, and all were white. Ten of the 13 subjects had 
DLBCL  (76.9%),  2  had  PMBCL  (15.4%),  and  1  had  TFL  (7.7%).  Subjects  received  a  median  of  4  prior 
regimens,  all  subjects  had  received  an  anthracycline  and  an  anti-CD20  agent,  and  11  subjects  (84.6%) 
received a platinum-based agent. Eight subjects (61.5%) were chemo-refractory and 3 subjects (23.1%) had 
relapsed  after  receiving  ASCT.  Two  subjects  with  DLBCL  had  relapsed,  transplant-ineligible  disease.  All  13

treated  subjects  underwent  post-treatment  assessments  for  disease  response  as  defined  by  IWG  2007 
criteria (Cheeson et al, 2007). 
Table 23: Objective tumour response in NCI 09-C-0082 
As of the data cutoff date for this report, median follow-up time for the 9 subjects who achieved an objective 
response was 9.4 months. All 9 subjects remained in response, and the longest ongoing response was  18+ 
months. Median duration of response was 8.8 months (range: 3 to 18 months). At a median follow-up time of 
9.4 months, the median PFS interval had not been reached. In the OS analysis, 10 subjects were still alive. 
The  3  subjects  who  died  included  the  2  subjects  with  disease  progression  as  best  response,  and  1  subject 
who progressed and died after having SD for approximately 2 months. Median OS has not been reached.  An 
update  of  DOR  (10  November  2016)  showed  that  the  Kaplan-Meier  median  DOR  had  not  been  reached 
(range: 2.8+ to 23+ months). 
Due to the small number of subjects in this group, analysis of response across subsets was not possible. The 
results in this subset were consistent with the overall results for the NCI study. As of 10 November 2016, the 
ORR for the entire study population of 43 subjects was 74%, with a CR rate of 54% and a PR rate of 21%. 
Twenty-one of the 43 subjects (49%) were still in response, with a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 
13  to  78  months).  Median  duration  of  response  was  35  months  (range:  2.8+  to  77  months).  Nineteen 
subjects (44%) had ongoing responses for more than 1 year. Twenty of the 43 subjects (47%) were still in 
CR,  with  a  median  follow-up  of  31  months  (range:  13  to  65  months).  Eighteen  subjects  (42%)  had  an 
ongoing CR for more than 1 year.

ZUMA-1 phase 1 
Table 24: Summary of Best Overall Response (Phase 1) 
Most subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 had stage III-IV disease, were refractory to second or greater line 
therapy, and had medium-high to high risk IPI scores. In Phase 1, the median age was 59 years (range: 29 
to 69 years); 71% of subjects were male and 86% were white. In Phase 2, the median age was 58 years 
(range: 23 to 76 years); most subjects (67%) were male, and 89% were white. 
Phase 1 identified a tolerable regimen for further study in Phase 2. Seven of 8 leukapheresed subjects 
received low-dose conditioning chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2) 
followed by a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel at 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  
The ORR according to the investigator’s assessment was 71% (5 responders among 7 subjects). All 5 
subjects who had a response achieved the response within 1 month after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
The 5 responders comprised 4 subjects (57%) with a CR and 1 subject (14%) with a PR. Among the 5 
subjects who achieved an objective response, the median DOR was not reached; with a median (95% CI) 
follow-up time of 17.1 months (16.3, 17.4 months). Three subjects remained in ongoing CR at 18+ months.  
Four responders had previously relapsed within 1 year of ASCT and 1 responder had been refractory to 
previous treatment. Among the 2 subjects who did not have an objective response, 1 had SD as a best 
response, and the other died prior to the first response assessment. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  main  study  for  this  application  is  KTE-C19-101  (ZUMA-1),  an  open-label  single  arm  multicenter  trial 
evaluating  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  KTE-C19  in  Subjects  with  Refractory  Aggressive  Non-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma, with supporting evidence coming from initial dose and regime finding NCI 09-C 0082 trial. Cohort 
1 of ZUMA-1 phase 2 included 77 patients with DLBCL cohort 2 included 24 patients with either TFL or PMBCL 
and the ongoing cohort 3 53 patients, of which about 34 have already been treated. The cohort 3 of ZUMA-1 
introduced  revised  CRS  and  neurotoxicity  management  algorithm  including  the  prophylactic  use  of 
tocilizumab and levatiracetam as well as the reactive use of corticosteroids and was originally not intended to

support  the primary  analysis  of  ZUMA-1.  Clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  at  25  USA  sites  and  1  Israel 
site (Sourasky Medical Center). No EU sites have been involved.  
Dose has been selected based on results of NCI Study 09C0082 aiming to achieve adequate lymphodepletion 
and therapeutic levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells without intolerable toxicity. The same dosing of conditioning 
chemotherapy  agents  and  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  given  in  ZUMA-Phase-1  with  the  result  of  1  DLT  in 
altogether 6 DLT-evaluable subjects, which was considered as tolerable and effective dose. Hence, no lower 
dose-regimen  for  chemotherapy  or  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  implemented  for  phase  2.  The  dose  finding 
methodology  used  in  NCI  09C-0082  and  in  Phase  1  part  of  the  ZUMA-1  trial  is  considered  generally 
acceptable. 
In Phase 2 of ZUMA-1, of the 111 subjects undergone leukapheresis, 103 subjects (93%) were treated with 
conditioning  chemotherapy  and  101  (91%)  were  treated  with  Yescarta.  With  respect  to  the  conduct  of  the 
ZUMA-1 phase 2 study, changes concerning particularly eligibility criteria of the target population have been 
implemented. While some of the changes are safety-related to improve prevention and management of AEs 
associated  with  CAR-T  cells  therapy,  other  changes  concerned  study  design  characteristics.  These  changes 
did not affect the integrity of the study. 
Further,  19  protocol  deviations  in  17  patients  of  the  mITT,  population  were  detected.  In  most  of  these 
patients  (12/17),  the  baseline-PET  scan  to  ensure  the  diagnose  was  not  performed  within  28  days  of 
conditioning chemotherapy, but within day -29 and -41 relative to conditioning chemotherapy, while none of 
these  patients  received  anti-cancer  therapy  during  the  interval.  Three  patients  received  a  compromised 
product,  but  all  of  them  received  the  minimum  dose  of  1x106  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells/kg  body  weight  and 
responded  to  therapy.  With  regard  to  7  patients,  who  either  received  steroids  within  7  days  prior  to 
leukapheresis  (n=2)  or  within  5  days  prior  to  infusion  with  Yescarta,  the  treatment  ended  2-4  days  before 
treatment with Yescarta in all cases. 
Response  determination  utilized  the  IWG  criteria  with  updated  recommendations  (the  Lugano  classification, 
Cheeson et al, 2014) for evaluation, staging and assessment of response in patients with NHL. 
Assessment  of  Quality-of-life  data  was  not  included  within  the  endpoints  of  ZUMA-1  phase  2;  however, 
outcomes based on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) are being investigated in cohort 3 of 
ZUMA-1 (see RMP). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results of the ZUMA-1 phase 2 study indicated that a single dose of treatment with Axicabtagene ciloleucel at 
a target doses of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (+/- 20%) showed a high increase of ORR and a clearly 
better efficacy profile compared to the retrospective global patient-level pooled study (Scholar-1) in patients 
with aggressive forms of NHL, specifically DLBCL, PMBCL and transformed follicular lymphoma. Based on the 
refined estimation in the ITT-population, the ORR was 66% with a complete response rate of 47% and a 
partial response rate of 19% (central review). These data are substantiated by similar ORR in ZUMA-1 Phase 
1 (71% ORR) and the subset of 13 subjects from NCI 09-C-0082 (69% ORR). Of note, the average remission 
rate of salvage therapy based on the SCHOLAR-1 results was about 25.7%. Despite limited follow up, 
durability of response is documented. For the 85% of patients with stage III/IV disease, efficacy assessment 
based on the central review showed lower values of ORR and time-dependent endpoints for patients in 
advanced disease stages (ORR: 69, CR: 45%) compared to stage I/II patients (ORR: 93%, CR: 45%), 
however a clear superiority compared to historical controls persists and no difference was shown with respect 
Assessment report

to CR rates between patients with advanced disease vs stage I/II patients. For some patients disappearance 
of either B-symptoms (6/6 patients) or hepatomegaly (5/6 patients) could be shown.  
Within ZUMA-1 phase 2, 101 of 111 patients who underwent leukapheresis received axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
While most of these patients had DLBCL (76%), 16% had TFL and 8% had PMBCL. All patients had a baseline 
ECOG-score of 0/1, the median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 1 to 10), 2 patients received study 
treatment for primary refractory disease, 26% had a history of primary refractory disease, 77% were 
refractory to 2nd or later line of therapy and 21% had a relapse within 12 months following ASCT. Baseline 
patients and disease characteristics appear very consistent between ITT and mITT population. Since the 
overall treatment includes the leukapheresis, chemotherapy and IMP-administration, all enrolled patients 
need to be considered. Further, main analyses should reflect the objective response data of the central 
assessment and not be based on study investigators addressing that the concordance of both assessments 
was 70.4% and that the local assessment tended systematically towards better outcomes. Particularly 
concerning the open-label, single-arm study, efficacy assessment based on the central review assessment 
was clearly preferred for regulatory decisions to minimize bias.  
By the data cut-off 11 August 2017, the ORR based on the mITT-analysis and investigator´s assessment was 
83% (95%CI: 74% to 90%) with a CR rate of 58%, while the ORR based on the ITT-population and central 
review was 66% (95% CI: 56% to 75%) with a CR rate of 47%. These data showed that the response based 
on the ITT-population and further based on the central review was lower, however, the general magnitude of 
effect compared to the outcomes of SCHOLAR-1 remains.  
While the estimated median DOR was 14 months, the estimated median DOR among all complete responders 
was not reached yet with an estimated median follow-up time of 11.3 months. The ORR based on the ITT 
population, central review and the 12 months update is consistent across cohorts in ZUMA-1: Cohort 1, 2 and 
combined (respectively Cohort 1: 64%, Cohort 2: 70%, combined 66%) and is also consistent with the NCI 
study (ORR: 69.2%) and ZUMA-1 Phase 1 (ORR: 71%). 
ORRs and 95% CIs for the Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2 combined were further analysed by baseline demographic 
and disease characteristics, product characteristics, and use of tocilizumab and systemic steroids.  Mean 
ORRs for each subset ranged from 67% to 99% and were comparable to the ORR for the Phase 2 population 
overall (83%) based on the mITT and investigator´s assessment. No significant impact of subsets based on 
age, sex, disease type (DLBCL, PMBCL, or TFL), and refractory subgroups, primary refractory status, 
refractory status to 2 or more consecutive lines of therapy, disease stage, IPI risk score, tumour burden,  
CD4:CD8 ratio of (> 1 or ≤ 1) and the use tocilizumab or steroids (yes or no) became apparent.  Responses 
also were consistent in subjects whose tumours were retrospectively assessed as CD19+ (ORR = 85%) or 
CD19– (ORR = 75%). However, the small sample size limits the significance of this subgroup ORR analysis. 
In  view  of  addressing  differences  in  view  of  morphology  and  histology,  efficacy  outcomes  (ORR,  CR,  DOR, 
PFS and OS) were assessed for subjects with either TFL or PMBCL in a pooled dataset comprising cohorts 2 
and 3 from phase 2 of ZUMA-1, using a cut-off date of 11 Aug 2017. The pooled data set comprised a total of 
23  subjects with TFL (16 from Cohort 2 and 7 from Cohort 3) and 14 subjects with PMBCL (8 subjects from 
Cohort  2  and  6  subjects  from  Cohort  3)  who  had  received  axicabtagene  ciloleucel.  The  ORR  based  on  the 
investigator´s assessment was comparable between DLBCL (83%) and the sum of TFL/PMBCL (76%). Some 
variability  was  seen  with  87%  (95%  CI:  66%,  97%)  for  TFL  and  at  57%  (95%  CI:  29%,  82%)  for  PMBCL 
however  better  outcomes  in  terms  of  time-dependent  endpoints.  Given  the  small  sample  size  of  these 
subgroups, there are no definite conclusions from these results. 
Scholar-1 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 84/127 
  
  
A retrospective, patient-level, pooled analysis of outcomes in refractory aggressive NHL (N = 636) was 
conducted (Crump et al., 2017).   
Of 636 Scholar-1 evaluable patients, 389 patients are comprised from two randomized phase 3 clinical 
studies (170 patients in CORAL, 219 patients in LY12), while 247 patients (MAYO N=82, MDACC N=165) are 
gained from retrospective databases. Scholar-1 was developed as a companion study to ZUMA-1 to provide 
context for interpreting the ZUMA-1 results. The analysis included patients who had not responded (stable 
disease [SD] or PD) to their last line of therapy, or had relapsed within 12 months after ASCT.  The ORR was 
26% [95% CI (21, 31)] and CR rate was 7% [95% CI (3, 15)], with a median OS of 6.3 months. The historic 
ORR was pre-specified in ZUMA-1 phase 2 as 20%. This was in general acknowledged.  However, after 
obtaining the historical control data of Scholar-1, the rate seems to be too low. The current point estimate of 
the Scholar-1 meta-analysis for the response rate was 25.7% (95% CI: 20.9%, 31.3%). In this light, further 
analyses are required to show that the ORR in ZUMA-1 is also (“significantly”) higher than the refined historic 
control based on the point estimate. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the estimate should be taken into 
consideration by comparing the results of ZUMA-1 also to the upper limit of the confidence interval. 
A re-analysis as “worst case” scenario was performed, by excluding patients with ECOG 2-4, patients with 
unknown ECOG, and patient’s whose baseline assessment was more than 3 months before relapse / 
refractory disease was diagnosed. With these patients, a head to head comparison of response (CR+PR), CR 
and OS comparing SCHOLAR-1 and ZUMA-1 was conducted. In this comparison, the difference in response 
rates between  SCHOLAR-1 (“worst case” subset) and ZUMA-1 (mITT set) was 53.1% (43.6%, 62.5%), the 
difference in CR rates was 46.9% (36.4%, 57.4%), and the hazard ratio for the reduction in the risk of death 
for subjects in the ZUMA-1 study was 0.4 (0.29, 0.56). Using the ITT set and central review, the difference 
for ORR between Scholar-1 (30.1%) and ZUMA-1 phase 2 (66%) was 35.9% and for CR between Scholar-1 
(11.5%) and ZUMA-1 phase 2 (47%) 35.5%. These values are lower than these provided by the applicant, 
but however indicate a superior treatment effect for Yescarta. 
Comparison of patients’ covariates of ZUMA-1 and Scholar-1 limited to only CORAL and LY12 shows a rather 
equal distribution of patients with regard to gender, IPI-score, and proportion of patients with relapse after 
ASCT. The proportion of patients with DLBCL was higher in Scholar-1 (90% vs. 76%). ZUMA-1 even has a 
larger proportion of patients with worse disease stages and higher numbers of already received 
chemotherapy numbers.  While ZUMA-1 only included patients with ECOG-scores of 0-1, this applies to only 
86% of Scholar-1 patients. The provided sensitivity analysis of the standardized estimates and comparisons 
of response by ECOG category (applicant´s answer on LOQ 172) showed –as expected– that patients with 
ECOG-0 and 1 had better outcomes as patients with ECOG 2-4. In detail, table 9 shows that e.g. with respect 
to the group of patients being refractory to second-or-greater-lines-of therapy, 24 % of these had ECOG 0/1, 
while 8% had ECOG 2-4. The same applies for patients, who had a relapse after ASCT: While 8% of the 
responder had ECOG 0/1, only 1% had ECOG 2-4.    
It  is  acknowledged,  that  DLBCL,  PMBLC  and  TFL  all  are  classified  as  large  cell  lymphoma  due  to  their 
similarities  with  respect  to  pathogenesis,  treatment  and  outcome.  PMBCL  and  transformed  FL  are  typically 
treated  along  a  DLBCL  treatment  paradigm.  In  accordance  with  the  updated  WHO  classification  (Swerdlow 
2016) transformed FL is not recognized as an entity but as DLBCL – which is nevertheless an heterogenous 
group-  therefore  it  was  considered  redundant  to  be  specifically  mentioned  in  the  indication.  The  indication 
has further been revised (see SmPC section 4.1) reflecting the most recent revision of the WHO classification 
(revised 4th edition 2017) of B-cell lymphoma subtypes, as: YESCARTA is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  and  primary  mediastinal  large 
B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

A detailed description of the patients based on genetic analyses and histology according to the WHO 2016 
classification is included within section 5.1 of the SmPC, while referring to the limited relevance of the 
genetics and to the issues of the retrospective analysis. Data on genetics will be collected prospectively as 
part of post-authorization studies (see RMP).  
Currently, several ZUMA studies are ongoing or planned. Updated efficacy data from the ongoing ZUMA-1 
study (Cohorts 1 & 2) would become available by 4Q 2018. The durability of the ongoing responses and 
additional survival data at 24 months would be provided (see RMP). 
The applicant provided interim data after treatment of 34/ 50 patients within cohort 3. While these data are 
not part of the MAA, they may support the ZUMA-1 phase 2 data, particularly those of TFL (n=7) and PMBCL 
(n=6). While the median follow-up time 5.9 months (range: 1.0 to 9.5 months), the efficacy data are 
consistent to those of ZUMA-1 phase 2 with respect to ORR sec(62%) and a CR rate of 44% at the data 
cutoff date of 11 Aug 2017. The list of planned studies provided by the Applicant also contains ZUMA-7, with 
the indication is limited to second line DLBCL patients and with randomized open-label design to demonstrate 
superiority to SOC in terms of EFS. ZUMA-7 trial is expected to provide further information as evaluation of 
the treatment on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and quality of life (QoL) compared to SOC is part of the 
secondary study objectives (see RMP). 
2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, a clinically relevant efficacy of the treatment with YESCARTA in Zuma -1 trial in patients with DLBCL 
and patients with PMBCL with significant duration has been demonstrated. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
A  total  of  136  subjects  were  enrolled  into  ZUMA-1  and  ZUMA-2  combined  (120  subjects  in  ZUMA-1  and  16 
subjects  in  ZUMA-2).    119  of  136  (88%)  subjects  were  treated  with  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  or  KTE-C19 
(XLP).  All treated subjects completed axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. The integrated dataset comprises 119 
subjects:  In ZUMA 1, no bridging therapy was permitted between the time of leukapheresis and infusion of 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel.    Within  ZUMA-1  another  cohort  (so-called  cohort  3)  was  recruited  that  received 
prophylactic treatment with tocilizumab once and levetiracetam daily in an attempt to reduce the incidence of 
CRS and neurological AE. This cohort comprised 39 patients in total, 34 of which were included in the safety 
analysis  as  they  had  received  axicabtagene  ciloleucel,  these  patients  were  reported  in  the  most  recent 
update. 
Since patients within ZUMA-2 were treated with product that was manufactured using a different process and 
patients  within  cohort  3  of  ZUMA-1  received  prophylactic  tocilizumab  and  levetiracetam  the  updated  safety 
analysis included only patients from ZUMA-1 phase 1 and phase 2, altogether 108 patients. Supportive data 
summaries  are  provided  for  a  subset  of  13  subjects  with  relapsed/refractory  aggressive  B-cell  NHL  (diffuse 
large  B-cell  lymphoma  [DLBCL],  primary  mediastinal  B-cell  lymphoma  [PMBCL]  and  transformed  follicular 
lymphoma  [TFL])  treated  in  NCI  Study  09-C-0082.  Additional  preliminary  safety  data  are  summarized 
separately for 11 adult subjects and 4 paediatric subjects with B precursor ALL treated in ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-

4, respectively.  Data from ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4 are not integrated with data from the lymphoma studies or 
with  each  other,  principally  because  the  patient  populations—adult  and  pediatric  B  lineage  ALL—have 
different  clinical  features,  treatment,  and  disease  courses.  ZUMA-2,  ZUMA-3  and  ZUMA-4  are  ongoing  and 
the data should be regarded as preliminary.

Adverse events 
All AEs occurring after the start of conditioning chemotherapy were considered to be treatment-emergent and 
will be referred to as AEs throughout the text, whereas those associated with leukapheresis were defined in 2 
ways: 1) events that were deemed related to leukapheresis by the investigator, and 2) events that occurred 
on the day of or the day after leukapheresis. AEs were considered if they occurred within 30 days after cell 
infusion, though for selected categories (CRS, neurologic events, infections, and cytopenias), AEs with onset 
after Day 30 were also examined.

Deaths 
Table 35 Deaths 
Four patients died due to an AE. Two of these were considered related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. In one case 
the  initiating  event  was  a  grade  4  CRS  with  cardiac  arrest,  the  second  case  was  a  patient  who  developed 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a rare disorder that is characterised by activation and proliferation of 
macrophages  and  histiocytes  that  is  primarily  caused  by  a  preceding  event  that  leads  to  activation  and 
proliferation  of  T  cells.  One  case  of  fatal  pulmonary  embolism  was  considered  unrelated  to  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel.  
In the supportive dataset three additional deaths were observed, one CRS and two infections (clostridium and 
mucormycosis). 
ZUMA-1 cohort 3 
There were 11 deaths at time of cut-off, all but one due to disease progression. One subject died due to 
cerebral oedema 9 days after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. This subject had rapidly progressing disease 
and a complicated course prior to administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel. After administration he developed 
signs of CRS and was treated accordingly. On day 7 after administration he developed brain oedema and 
brain herniation. He died on day 8, the death was considered causally related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Retrospective analyses indicated elevated cytokine levels compatible with an ongoing inflammatory process.  
Safety Following Retreatment with Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in Phase 1 and Phase 2 
Retreatment  was  done  for  1  subject  in  Phase  1  and  9  subjects  in  Phase  2.  The  overview  profile  following 
retreatment in Phase 2 was consistent with that reported for the main analysis of Phase 2 data: all 9 subjects 
had AEs; 4 subjects had SAEs; 8 subjects had conditioning chemotherapy-related AEs, 6 of which were Grade 
3  or  higher;  9  subjects  had  axicabtagene  ciloleucel-related  AEs,  4  of  which  were  Grade  3  or  higher;  6 
subjects had CRS (no Grade 3 or higher); and 5 had neurologic events, 2 of which were Grade 3 or higher. 
For Phase 1, a summary of AEs during retreatment was not provided because only 1 subject was retreated.

Adverse Events of special interest 
Cytokine release syndrome 
CRS occurred in 93% of patients, 12% of whom experienced Grade 3 or higher (severe, life threatening and 
fatal) CRS.  The median time to onset was 2 days (range 1 to 12 days) and the median duration was 7 days, 
with a range of 2 to 29 days.  Ninety-eight percent (98%) of patients recovered from CRS. The most common 
signs or symptoms associated with CRS include pyrexia (76%), hypotension (41%), hypoxia (21%), 
tachycardia (21%) and chills (19%).  Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with CRS include 
acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, capillary leak 
syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation 
syndrome (HLH/MAS) (SmPC, section 4.8).

Neurological adverse reactions 
Neurologic adverse reactions occurred in 65% of patients, 31% of whom experienced Grade 3 or higher 
(severe or life threatening) adverse reactions.  The median time to onset was 5 days (range 1 to 17 days).  
The median duration was 13 days, with a range of 1 to 191 days.  Ninety-eight percent (98%) of all patients 
recovered from neurologic adverse reactions (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The most common signs or symptoms associated with neurologic adverse reactions include encephalopathy 
(58%), tremor (31%), aphasia (18%) and delirium (17%).  Serious adverse reactions including 
encephalopathy (20%), aphasia (4%), delirium (4%), and seizures (1%) have been reported in patients 
administered YESCARTA (SmPC, section 4.8).

Association of cytokine levels with neurological events (ZUMA-1, Safety set) 
The AUC of IL-15 and IL-6 were measured throughout the first 4 weeks after infusion of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel in subjects who developed Grade 3 or higher neurologic events compared with levels in subjects 
who had Grade 2 or lower events. Bonferroni-stepdown corrected P-values, using a prespecified group of 
serum analytes, for IL-15 and IL-6 with neurologic events were 0.0003 and < 0.0001, respectively. Similarly, 
AUC of IL-2Rα (P = 0.0829) and IL-10 (P = 0.0123) were also associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
events as compared to subjects with Grade 2 or lower events. The association between peak levels of IL-15, 
IL-6, IL-2Rα, IL-10 and Grade 3 or higher neurologic events respectively, was also significant.  
Peak and cumulative levels of IL-2 and ferritin were also associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic events 
(P < 0.05 after multiplicity adjustment) and were not associated with CRS.  
The following serum markers, by peak or AUC, were also associated with both Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
events and Grade 3 or higher CRS: the cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ; the chemokines IP-10 and IL-8; the pro-
inflammatory marker IL-1ra; the immune effector molecule granzyme B; and the angiogenic factor VCAM-1 
(all P < 0.05 by Bonferroni-stepdown).

Cerebral oedema  
The  safety  data  base  was  reviewed  for  a  broad  range  of  CNS  AEs  as  well  as  specific  events  of  cerebral 
oedema  (cerebral  congestion,  vasogenic  cerebral  oedema,  brain  oedema,  and  cerebral  oedema 
management).  Baseline  brain  MRI  was  required  for  ZUMA-1.  In  addition,  brain  MRI  and  head  computed 
tomography (CT) reports obtained for subjects with Grade 2 or higher neurologic events were reviewed. 
After the data cutoff for the primary analysis of ZUMA-1, confirmed neurologic events of cerebral oedema 
were observed in 2 subjects across the lymphoma ZUMA studies.  
One fatal event occurred in the safety expansion cohort (Cohort 3) of ZUMA-1, which enrolled distinct 
subjects from those enrolled in the pivotal portion of study.  
The other case occurred in a subject with MCL treated on ZUMA 2 and resolved to baseline neurologic status 
(using KTE-C19 manufactured using the XLP process – a different process to YESCARTA).

One subject (1%) treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel developed non-serious Grade 3 TLS in ZUMA-1. 
No subject developed an AE of TLS in ZUMA-2.  
Febrile neutropenia and infections  
Febrile neutropenia was observed in 35% of patients after YESCARTA infusion.  Infections occurred in 38% of 
patients in ZUMA-1.  Grade 3 or higher (severe, life threatening, or fatal) occurred in 25% of patients.  
Grade 3 or higher unspecified pathogen, bacterial, and viral infections occurred in 19%, 8%, and 6% of 
patients, respectively.  The most common site of infection was in the respiratory tract (SmPC, section 4.8).  
Prolonged Cytopenias  
Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 
93%, 63% and 56% of patients respectively.  Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
anaemia still present at Day 30 or beyond occurred in 31%, 27%, and 17% of patients respectively (SmPC, 
section 4.8). 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
In ZUMA-1, hypogammaglobulinaemia occurred in 17% of patients.  See section 4.4 for management 
guidance(SmPC, section 4.8). 
Immunogenicity  
The immunogenicity of YESCARTA has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
for the detection of binding antibodies against FMC63, the originating antibody of the anti-CD19 CAR.  Three 
patients tested positive for anti FMC63 prior to being treated with YESCARTA.  An impact of these antibodies 
on efficacy or safety was not discernible (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Secondary malignancies 
Two patients in ZUMA-1 developed myelodysplastic syndrome, both were considered not related to 
conditioning chemotherapy or axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Analysis of replication competent retrovirus (RCR) 
By protocol there were samples taken for RCR on Day 0 prior to administration of T cells, harvested and 
measured at 3, 6 and 12 months. Follow-up will involve yearly sampling but measuring only if positive at the 
12 month visit, or before. No RCR have been observed.

Sex 
Women appear to be more prone to AE. They had a numerically higher incidences of SAE, neurological SAE, 
grade 3 or higher neurological events and grade 3 or higher infections. 
AE by total T cell number 
Subjects who received product with total T-cells number ≤ the population median had a higher incidence of 
Grade  3  or  higher  CRS  than  subjects  who  received  product  with  total  T  cells  number  >  population  median 
(17.6% vs 8.0%). AE by transduction rate 
Subjects who received product with a transduction rate higher than the median rate had a higher incidence of 
Grade  3  or  higher  AEs  (50%  vs  35%)  and  Grade  3  or  higher  axicabtagene  ciloleucel-related  AEs  (50%  vs 
35%). 
AEs by Total Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell Dose Percentiles 
There  is  a  pattern  with  increases  of  AE  incidence  from  the  lowest  quartile  to  the  second  quartile;  however, 
within the highest quartile the incidence appears to be decreasing again.   
AEs by IFN- gamma in co-culture 
The following categories of AEs were more frequent in subjects dosed with product potency > the population 
median  than  in  subjects  dosed  with  product  potency  ≤  the  population  median:  Grade  3  or  Axicabtagene 
ciloleucel;  higher  SAE  (48%  vs  37.3%);  Grade  3  or  higher  axicabtagene  ciloleucel-related  AE  (70.0%  vs 
56.9%); Grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related SAE (48.0% vs 37.3%); neurologic event (36.0% 
vs 19.6%); and neurologic SAE (26.0% vs 15.7%).  
Immunological events 
The immunogenicity of YESCARTA has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
for the detection of binding antibodies against FMC63, the originating antibody of the anti-CD19 CAR. Three 
of 94 patients in ZUMA-1 tested positive at baseline for antibodies to the murine antibody FMC63 used for the 
development of the anti-CD19 part of the CAR construct. One of these had evidence of binding to the cellular 
expressed construct. Clinical course seemed not distinguishable in these three patients compared to patients 
that were negative for anti-FMC63.  
Anti-bovine  serum  albumin  was  detected  in  30%  of  patients  at  baseline  in  ZUMA-1.  Fifteen  subjects  (15%) 
were  antibody  positive  post-baseline  with  a  negative  or  no  result  at  baseline,  with  fluctuating  levels  and  no 
evidence of immune allergic reactions.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  population  set  for  the  primary  analysis  was  originally  comprised  of  119  subjects  from  the 
combined ZUMA-1 & 2, thus presented a population affected by relapsed/refractory DLBCL, PMBCL and MCL. 
This approach was modified to include only patients from ZUMA-1 which is acceptable as there are relevant 
differences  in  the  population  and  the  treatment  of  patients  recruited  to  ZUMA-2.  Therefore,  data  from  108 
patients of the ZUMA-1 trial (7 patients in Phase 1 and 101 patients in Phase 2) are considered as principal 
source of safety information. The data cutoff date for the updated analysis was 11.08.2017, at which time all 
patients would be followed for 12 months from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
Patients  were  treated  with  doses  of  CAR-T  cells  of  1.1-2.2  x  106  CAR  T  cells/kg  body  weight.  Currently  the 
importance of the actually administered dose is not clear as the CAR T cells will proliferate in vivo. Given the 
general  knowledge  of  lymphocyte  proliferation  it  seems  unlikely  that  a  twofold  difference  in  infused  cells 
would be clinically meaningful, but this is of course dependent on the proliferative capability of the cells. The 
majority of patients was male (70%), white (90%) and from the USA (99%).  
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 55% of patients.  The most common serious adverse reactions include 
encephalopathy  (20%),  unspecified  pathogen  infections  (15%),  bacterial  infections  (5%),  viral  infections 
(5%), pyrexia (5%), and febrile neutropenia (5%) (SmPC section 4.8). 
Close to all patients experienced adverse events related to the investigative product with many (over 80%) 
having  Grade  3  or  higher  events  and  more  than  half  in  all  trials  having  investigative  product  related  SAEs, 
and  a  pattern  could  be  distinguished  whereby  in  particular  events  of  encephalopathy,  pyrexia,  (febrile) 
neutropenia,  anaemia,  hypotension  and  hypoxia  tend  to  form  a  non-negligible  burden  on  the  subject  in the 
form of Grade 3 or higher AES and SAEs and treatment related deaths. 
The most common Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions include encephalopathy (30%), unspecified pathogen 
infection  (19%),  cytokine  release  syndrome  (12%),  bacterial  infection  (8%),  aphasia  (7%),  viral  infection 
(6%), delirium (6%), hypotension (6%) and hypertension (6%). 
The most serious and frequently occurring adverse reactions are CRS (93%), encephalopathy (58%), and 
infections (38%).  Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia still present at Day 30 or 
beyond occurred in 31%, 27% and 17% of patients respectively (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Sequelae  of  conditioning  chemotherapy  such  as  anaemia,  cytopenias,  neutropenic  fever,  infection  are  an 
expected  AE  for  the  treatment  regimen.  Axicabtagene  ciloleucel  may  contribute  to  these  AE  via  secondary 
mechanisms such as sequestration of lymphocytes and platelets following cytokine release or via mechanisms 
involving the bone marrow function.  Neutropenia, neutropenic fever and infections are very common, as is 
thrombocytopenia. There were two deaths reported in the supportive dataset that were caused by infection. 
One  death  was  caused  by  an  intracranial  haemorrhage  following  thrombocytopenia  that  was  assessed  as 
chemotherapy related, an infection may have contributed to the fatal outcome.  
Cytokine release syndrome is very commonly observed and is clearly caused by axicabtagene ciloleucel. CRS 
occurred in 93% of patients, 12% of whom experienced Grade 3 or higher (severe, life threatening and fatal) 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018 
Page 105/127 
  
  
 
CRS.  The median time to onset was 2 days (range 1 to 12 days) and the median duration was 7 days, with a 
range of 2 to 29 days.  Ninety-eight percent (98%) of patients recovered from CRS (SmPC, section 4.8). CRS 
have been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Cardiac failure has been observed as well as cardiac arrhythmia, possibly aggravated by serum electrolyte 
disturbances. CRS was the likely cause of one fatal case of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and one 
fatal case of brain injury following cardiac arrest. 
The most common signs or symptoms associated with CRS include pyrexia (76%), hypotension (41%), 
hypoxia (21%), tachycardia (21%) and chills (19%).  Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with 
CRS include acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, 
capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia, and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage 
activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The phenotypically similar tumour lysis syndrome appears to be less common as could be deduced from the 
low  incidence  of  reported  AE  of  acute  kidney  injury,  hyperkalemia,  hyperphosphataemia  and  increase  in 
serum  uric  acid.  However,  a  relevant  shift  to  increased  values  of  uric  acid  and  creatinine  is  reported  in  the 
laboratory section which could point to a relevant frequency of tumour lysis syndrome that is not identified as 
such because of the predominant features of CRS. To minimise risk of TLS, patients with elevated uric acid or 
high  tumour  burden  should  receive  allopurinol,  or  an  alternative  prophylaxis,  prior  to  YESCARTA  infusion.  
Signs  and  symptoms  of  TLS  should  be  monitored  and  events  managed  according  to  standard  guidelines 
(SmPC section 4.4). 
Neurological adverse reactions, especially encephalopathy of varying degrees with symptoms and signs such 
as somnolence, confusion, tremor, headache or aphasia was observed in the majority of patients. 31% of 
subjects had a ≥ grade 3 neurological adverse reaction. The median time to the onset of neurological adverse 
reaction was 5 days (range 1-17) and the median time to resolution was 17 days. The relationship of CRS 
and the neurological adverse reaction still requires further clarification. A pathophysiological explanation of 
the observed encephalopathy seems rather obscure at present. Similar neurotoxicity has been observed with 
other forms of CD19 directed immunotherapies such as blinatumomab so there is a reason to believe that 
this is caused either by the intended pharmacological effect, i.e. cyotoxicity and cytokine release by CAR T 
cells to their natural CD19 positive target (B cells), CD19 expression on other cells of the central nervous 
system or crossreactivity to a yet unknown target. However, it may also be caused by systemic CRS in a 
population that is prone to this neurological AE. Serious neurologic adverse reactions including cerebral 
oedema have been been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). Patients with a history of 
CNS disorders such as seizures or cerebrovascular ischemia may be at increased risk. Fatal and serious cases 
of cerebral oedema have been reported in patients treated with YESCARTA. Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of neurologic adverse reactions (Table 2). Patients should be monitored at least daily for 
10 days at the qualified healthcare facility following infusion for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity.  
After the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician’s discretion.  
Counsel patients to remain within proximity, of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following 
infusion and to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicity occur at 
any time. Monitoring of vital signs and organ functions should be considered depending on the severity of the 
reaction. Patients who experience Grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicities should be monitored with 
continuous cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry. Provide intensive care supportive therapy for severe or life 
threatening neurologic toxicities. Non-sedating, anti-seizure medicines should be considered as clinically 
indicated for Grade 2 or higher adverse reactions. Treatment algorithms have been developed to ameliorate 
the neurologic adverse reactions experienced by patients on YESCARTA.  This includes the use of tocilizumab

(if concurrent CRS) and/or corticosteroids for moderate, severe or life threatening neurologic adverse 
reactions (SmPC section 4.4) 
Serious infections have been very commonly observed with Yescarta. Patients should be monitored for signs 
and symptoms of infection before, during, and after Yescarta infusion and treated appropriately.  Prophylactic 
anti-microbials should be administered according to standard institutional guidelines (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Infections have been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Febrile neutropenia has been observed in patients after Yescarta infusion and may be concurrent with CRS.  
In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids 
and other supportive care as medically indicated (SmPC, section 4.4). 
HBV  reactivation,  in  some  cases  resulting  in  fulminant  hepatitis,  hepatic  failure  and  death,  can  occur  in 
patients treated with drugs directed against B cells.  Screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV should be performed 
in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing (SmPC, section 4.4). 
B-cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia can occur in patients receiving treatment with Yescarta.  
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been very commonly observed in patients treated with Yescarta.  
Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with Yescarta and managed using infection 
precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Hypogammaglobulinemia has been categorized as identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Allergic  reactions  may  occur  with  the  infusion  of  Yescarta.    Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  including 
anaphylaxis, may be due to DMSO or residual gentamicin in Yescarta (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Patients treated with Yescarta may develop secondary malignancies.  Monitor life-long for secondary 
malignancies.  In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, the company should be conctacted to obtain 
instructions on patient samples to collect for testing (SmPC, section 4.4). Secondary malignancy has been 
categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), anaemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 
93%, 63% and 56% of patients respectively.  Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
anaemia still present at Day 30 or beyond occurred in 31%, 27%, and 17% of patients respectively (SmPC, 
section 4.8).  Cytopenias including aplastic anaemia have been categorized as potential risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
The immunogenicity of YESCARTA has been evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
for the detection of binding antibodies against FMC63, the originating antibody of the anti-CD19 CAR.  Three 
patients tested positive for anti FMC63 prior to being treated with YESCARTA.  An impact of these antibodies 
on efficacy or safety was not discernible. Immunogenicity has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
TLS, which may be severe, has occasionally been observed.  To minimise risk of TLS, patients with elevated 
uric  acid  or  high  tumour  burden  should  receive  allopurinol,  or  an  alternative  prophylaxis,  prior  to  Yescarta 
infusion.    Signs  and  symptoms  of  TLS  should  be  monitored  and  events  managed  according  to  standard 
guidelines (SmPC, section 4.4). TLS has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
There is limited experience with Yescarta in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy. Yescarta is not 
recommended if the patient has relapsed with CD19-negative disease after prior anti-CD19 therapy (SmPC, 
section 4.4).

There  is  a  theoretical  risk  of  aggravation  of  GvHD  in  patients  who  have  previously  undergone  an  allogeneic 
stem-cell  transplant  (allo-HSCT)  and  then  received  donor  derived  engineered  CAR  T  cells  (from  prior  allo-
HSCT  donor)  for  their  relapsed  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL).  No  patients  in  the  ZUMA-1  had  previously 
undergone  allo-HSCT..  Aggravation  of  GvHD  has  been  categorized  as  potential  risk  (see  Risk  Management 
Plan). 
Needle stick injuries may occur among health care providers, although they have been reduced by minimizing 
handling  of  body  fluids  and  needles.  No  health  care  providers  experienced  exposure  to  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel during the ZUMA-1 study. Administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel is not associated with a risk of 
splash  or  spill  and  disposal  of  used  and  exposed  materials  should  follow  local  biosafety  guidelines. 
Transmission  of  infectious  agents  via  product  has  been  categorized  as  potential  risk  (see  Risk  Management 
Plan). 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel must be prepared and administered per specifications or there is a potential risk of 
decrease in viability of the product. There have been no reports linked to decrease in viability of the product 
due to inappropriate preparation of cell infusion in the ZUMA 1 studies.  Decrease in viability of the product 
due to inappropriate preparation of infusion has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management 
Plan). 
The γ retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3 Vector used for transduction of subject-derived autologous T cells is 
replication-defective and to date, no RCR has been detected in Vector lots or in axicabtagene ciloleucel final 
product lots.  The risk of RCR occurring in subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel is considered to be 
low due to 1) the vector and packaging cell line used, and 2) rigorous testing prior to release of the final 
product.  Replication-competent retrovirus has been categorized as potential risk (see Risk Management 
Plan). 
This  medicinal  product  contains  300 mg  sodium  per  infusion,  equivalent  to  15%  of  the  WHO  recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult (SmPC, section 4.4). 
Yescarta has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Due to the potential for neurologic 
events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients should refrain from driving or operating heavy or 
potentially dangerous machines until at least 8 weeks after infusion or until resolution of neurologic adverse 
reactions (SmPC, section 4.7). 
There are no data regarding the signs of overdose with Yescarta (SmPC, section 4.9). 
Missing information in several patient groups: Use in pregnancy and lactation, use in non-Caucasian patient 
populations, use in HIV, HCV positive patients, new occurrence or exacerbation of an autoimmune disorder 
and long term safety. Routine risk minimization activities recommend specific clinical measures to address 
these (see Risk Management Plan). 
In  an  analysis  of  safety  in  several  subgroups  there  was  an  increase  of  neurological  events  in  subject  ≥65 
years and a higher incidence of SAE and ≥ grade 3 AE in women. The observed acute AE/ADR are to a large 
extent of limited duration and reversible. For the treatment of treatment-related AE the protocol ZUMA-1 was 
amended  several  times.  In  ZUMA-1  43/101  subjects  were  treated  with  tocilizumab  (CRS  17,  neurological 
events 33, other 5) and 27/101 subjects received glucocorticoids (CRS 6, neurological events 15, other 17).  
25/101  received  tocilizumab  and  glucocorticoids.  No  patient  tested  positive  for  replication-competent 
retrovirus  so  far.  Testing  will  include  a  12  months  time-point,  after  this  time-point  testing  will  only  be 
performed if a positive result has been obtained earlier or on clinical suspicion.

The  updated  safety  analysis  set  confirms  the  initially  performed  analyses  and  there  are  no  relevant  new 
findings.  Supportive  data  are  available  from  13  patients  using  different  AE  collection  methodology  and  15 
patients  in  a  different  indication  (B-precursor  ALL).  The  safety  database  is  therefore  considered  rather 
limited. The follow-up of patients is short, the median FU time in lymphoma dataset is 5.9 months, maximum 
17.9 months. Safety data from a currently recruiting cohort (phase 3) will be provided (see RMP).   
Safety data in the post marketing setting will be provided from a non-interventional post-authorisation safety 
study (PASS) based on a registry. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment is associated with a high incidence of ADR of a severity of ≥ grade 3 and/or 
serious.  Cytokine  release  syndrome  and  neurological  adverse  reactions  are  likely  caused  by  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel  while  cytopenias  are  more  likely  to  be  predominantly  related  to  conditioning  chemotherapy  or 
previous therapies.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
•  A non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) based on a registry to assess the safety 
profile in patients with B-lymphocyte malignancies treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in the post 
marketing setting. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.10.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that axicabtagene ciloleucel has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers axicabtagene ciloleucel to be a new active substance as it 
is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, YESCARTA (axicabtagene ciloleucel) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance   
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication of axicabtagene ciloleucel is: treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL are typically treated with rituximab and platinum-
based chemotherapy regimens. The current standard of care for these patients is second-line chemotherapy 
plus  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  (ASCT).  However,  only  half  of  the  patients  with  relapsed/refractory 
disease may undergo ASCT, as the others are ineligible for ASCT (due to an inadequate response to second 
line  therapy,  relapse  after  second  or  greater  line  of  therapy,  failure  to  mobilize  stem  cells,  or  presence  of 
comorbidities). These patients have no curative options and thus have a clear unmet medical need.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Yescarta was primarily supported by data  from ZUMA-1 phase 2 open-label, single-
arm study which enrolled 111 adult patients with refractory or relapsed DLBCL patients –including DLBCL 
arising from follicular lymphoma and PMBCL. 
3.2.    Favourable effects 
In ZUMA-1 phase 2, among 111 leukapherized subjects, 110 lots of axicabtagene ciloleucel were successfully 
manufactured (>99%) and 101 subjects (91%) received axicabtagene ciloleucel. The ORR based on the ITT-
population and on the central review assessment was 66 % (95% CI: 56%, 75%) with a complete response 
rate of 47 %; based on the mITT-population and the investigator ORR was 83%. The estimated median DOR 
was 14.0 months (95% CI: 8.3, NE) and was not yet reached in patients who achieved CR with a median 
follow up of 15.1 months. The average remission rate of salvage therapy based on the SCHOLAR-1 results is 
about 25.7%. ORRs and 95% CIs for the Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 2 combined were further analysed by 
baseline demographic and disease characteristics, product characteristics, and use of tocilizumab and 
systemic steroids.  Mean ORRs for each subset ranged from 67% to 99% and were comparable to the ORR 
for the Phase 2 population overall (83%) based on the mITT and investigator´s assessment. No significant 
impact of subsets based on age, sex, disease type (DLBCL or PMBCL), and refractory subgroups, primary 
refractory status, refractory status to 2 or more consecutive lines of therapy, disease stage, IPI risk score, 
tumour burden,  CD4:CD8 ratio of (> 1 or ≤ 1) and the use tocilizumab or steroids (yes or no) became 
appearant.  Responses also were consistent in subjects whose tumours were retrospectively assessed as 
CD19+ (ORR = 85%) or CD19– (ORR = 75%).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties about the favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable Effects 
The most serious and frequently occurring adverse reactions are CRS (93%), encephalopathy (58%), and 
infections (38%).  Most of the reported acute adverse events are likely to be a consequence of CRS such as 
pyrexia, chills, tachycardia, serum electrolyte changes, headache and myalgia are the consequences to the 
function of important organs such as hypoxia, hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbances and acute kidney 
injury. Two of the reported deaths were likely a consequence of CRS. CRS occurs predominantly in the first 
two weeks after infusion and eventually subsides. Empirical treatment recommendations have been provided 
that take severity of CRS into account.   
The availability of tocilizumab at all hospitals and associated centres must be ensured by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder until an authorised treatment for CRS is available in the EU. Yescarta will only be 
supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified and only if the healthcare professionals 
involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the educational program.  To mitigate the safety risks 
associated with the treatment of Yescarta, it must be ensured that hospitals and their associated centres that 
dispense Yescarta are specially qualified (see Annex II and RMP). 
Neurological adverse reactions occurred in the majority of patients which appear to be mostly non-localising, 
i.e. encephalopathy with the symptoms and signs such as change in consciousness levels, disturbance of 
attention, somnolence, agitation, confusion and attention disturbance but there are also potentially localising 
symptoms and signs such as ataxia, dyskinesia, speech disorders and aphasia. A case of cerebral oedema 
with a fatal outcome has been reported from an expansion cohort of the ongoing clinical trial. 
Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia still present at Day 30 or beyond occurred in 
31%,  27%  and  17%  of  patients  respectively.  Cytopenias  were  observed  very  commonly  and  involved  all 
lineages  (neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  anaemia  thrombocytopenia  and  leukopenia)  also  associated with 
the occurrence of infections and bleeding. Infections were observed very commonly. There were two deaths 
reported  in  the  supportive  dataset  that  were  caused  by  infection.  One  death  was  caused  by  an  intracranial 
haemorrhage following thrombocytopenia that was assessed as chemotherapy related, an infection may have 
contributed to the fatal outcome. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database is considered rather limited in terms of size and duration. The follow-up of patients is 
short, the median FU time in lymphoma dataset is 5.9 months, maximum 17.9 months. Safety data from a 
currently recruiting cohort (phase 3) will be provided (see RMP).   
A PASS study using a registry is planned with the purpose of additional characterization of identified risks, 
further evaluation of potential risks and missing information with special focus on long-term safety to assess 
whether administration is associated with subsequent neoplasm (See RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel at target doses of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg body weight 
shows a significant increase of ORR and a clearly better efficacy profile compared to the retrospective global 
patient-level pooled study Scholar-1 and Coral  in patients with aggressive forms of NHL, specifically DLBCL, 
PMBCL and transformed follicular lymphoma. The ORR of ZUMA-1 based on the ITT-population and central 
review lays about 66%, while the pre-specified ORR for SCHOLAR-1 was about 25.7%. The superiority of 
ORR in ZUMA-1 phase compared to SCHOLAR-1 is further supported by significant increase of DOR. 
CRS  and  cytopenias  are  transient  ADR  that  appear  to  be  amenable  to  treatment.  Neurological  adverse 
reactions  also  appear  to  be  transient,  with  only  one  case  was  judged  as  not  resolved  (mild  memory 
impairment).  
A PASS study using a registry is planned with the purpose of additional characterization of identified risks, 
further evaluation of potential risks and missing information with special focus on long-term safety to assess 
whether administration is associated with subsequent neoplasm. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The treatment effect of Yescarta is considered clinically relevant. The safety profile of Yescarta is acceptable 
in view of the therapeutic context and the observed benefits. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of YESCARTA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy is positive. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of YESCARTA is favourable in the following indication: 
YESCARTA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy.

medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Key elements: 
Availability of tocilizumab and site qualification 
To minimise the risks associated with the treatment of YESCARTA, the MAH must ensure that hospitals and 
their associated centres that dispense YESCARTA are specially qualified in accordance with the agreed control 
distribution program.  
The MAH must ensure on-site, immediate access to 4 doses of tocilizumab for each patient as CRS 
management medication prior to treating patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/481168/2018

YESCARTA will only be supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified and only if the 
healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the educational program. 
The availability of tocilizumab at all hospitals and associated centres must be ensured by the MAH until an 
authorised treatment for CRS is available in the EU. 
Educational program – Prior to the launch of YESCARTA in each Member State the MAH must agree the 
content and format of the educational materials with the National Competent Authority.  
HCP Educational program  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where YESCARTA is marketed, all HCPs who are expected to 
prescribe, dispense, and administer YESCARTA shall be provided with a guidance document to: 
-         facilitate identification of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
-     facilitate management of the CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
-         ensure adequate monitoring of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
-         facilitate provision of all relevant information to patients 
-         ensure that adverse reactions are adequately and appropriately reported 
-         ensure that detailed instructions about the thawing procedure are provided 
- 
before treating a patient, ensure that  4 doses of tocilizumab for each patient are available on site 
Patient Educational program  
To inform and explain to patients  
- 
- 
- 
- 
the risks of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions, associated with YESCARTA 
the need to report the symptoms to their treating doctor immediately 
the need to remain in the proximity of the location where YESCARTA was received for at least 4 
weeks following YESCARTA infusion 
the need to carry the patient alert card at all times  
•  Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

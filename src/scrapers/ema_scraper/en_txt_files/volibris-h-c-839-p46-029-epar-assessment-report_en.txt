1.  Introduction
On 18 November 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (ID AMB114588) for 
ambrisentan (Volibris), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.
2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Information on the development program
Background on the product and disease/condition
Ambrisentan is an orally active, propanoic acid-class, endothelium receptor antagonist (ERA) selective 
for the endothelin type A receptor. Endothelin plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Ambrisentan is currently approved by the European Commission under the brand name Volibris as 2.5 
mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets for oral use for the following indications:
Volibris is indicated for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of 
WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III, including use in combination treatment (see section 5.1). 
Efficacy has been shown in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and in PAH associated with connective tissue 
disease. 
Volibris is indicated for treatment of PAH in adolescents and children (aged 8 to less than 18 
years) of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III including use in combination treatment. Efficacy 
has been shown in IPAH, familial, corrected congenital and in PAH associated with connective 
tissue disease (see section 5.1). 
PAH is a rare, progressive, highly debilitating disorder characterized by angioproliferative vasculopathy 
in the pulmonary arterioles, leading to endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation and dysfunction, 
inflammation and thrombosis. These changes increase pulmonary vascular resistance and subsequent 
pulmonary arterial pressure, causing right ventricular failure which leads to eventual death if 
untreated. Similar to adults, paediatric PAH is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 
≥25 mmHg at rest with a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg and an 
increased pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood units x m2 (≈240 dyn s cm–5) in the absence of 
lung disease. However, there are important known differences in vascular function, foetal origins of 
disease, growth and development, genetics, natural history, underlying disease, responses of the right 
ventricle, responsiveness to PAH-specific therapies, and gaps in knowledge, particularly in the 
youngest age groups.
Paediatric development
On 21 April 2008, ambrisentan was firstly approved by the EC as 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets 
for oral use for the treatment of PAH in adult patients of WHO Functional Class II to III, including use 
in combination treatment.
On 22 July 2021, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on an application (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/000839/X/0061/G) consisting of an extension of the marketing authorisation to introduce a 
new strength (2.5 mg film-coated tablet), grouped with an extension of indication to include treatment 
of PAH in adolescents and children (8 to less than 18 years). For the submission of this application, the 
MAH submitted a pivotal phase 2b study (ID AMB112529, which is part of the agreed PIP) and its 
ongoing extension study (ID AMB114588; data cut-off date for the interim report: 23 Aug 2019).
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the referred paediatric indication application 
included an EMA Decision (P/0370/2019) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
(EMEA-000434-PIP01-08-M06) for oral use of ambrisentan as film-coated tablet and dispersible tablet 
for the treatment of idiopathic (IPAH) and familial (FPAH) pulmonary hypertension as well as the 
treatment of associated pulmonary hypertension (APAH). 
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to 
the EMA a final study report for study AMB114588 which is not part of the PIP agreed to ambrisentan. 
The MAH stated that study AMB114588 (EudraCT Number: 2010-021572-29)  titled “An open-label, 
long term extension study for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in paediatric patients aged 
8 years up to 18 years who have participated in AMB112529 and in whom continued treatment with 
ambrisentan is desired” is part of a clinical development program. The variation application consisting 
of the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 
second quartile 2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies has not been submitted by the 
applicant. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study
Ambrisentan is authorised in the European Union to be used in adult patients and adolescents and 
children (aged 8 to less than 18 years) as 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets for oral use. 
The approved posology for the paediatric indication is:

In paediatric patients, when co-administered with cyclosporine A, the dose of ambrisentan for patients 
≥50 kg should be limited to 5 mg once daily, or for patients ≥20 to <50 kg should be limited to 2.5 mg 
once daily. The patient should be carefully monitored. 
In the hereby submitted study, ambrisentan was provided to study centers at the following dosage 
forms and strengths:
• Commercially available 10 mg tablet 
• Commercially available 5 mg tablet 
• Manufactured 2.5 mg tablet of equivalent. The 2.5 mg tablet was developed for use in paediatric 
populations (see procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000839/X/0061/G).
Participants in study AMB114588 could receive 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg of ambrisentan per 
day, dosed orally (tablet[s] in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg strengths swallowed whole), once daily.
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The MAH submitted a final reports for:
•
Study AMB114588 (EudraCT Number: 2010-021572-29) – “An open-label, long term extension 
study for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in paediatric patients aged 8 years up to 18 
years who have participated in AMB112529 and in whom continued treatment with ambrisentan is 
desired”
Please note that an interim analysis of this extension study (ID AMB114588) was submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) to support regulatory activities (Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/000839/X/0061/G). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study
Study AMB114588 (EudraCT Number: 2010-021572-29) – “An open-label, 
long term extension study for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
in paediatric patients aged 8 years up to 18 years who have participated in 
AMB112529 and in whom continued treatment with ambrisentan is 
desired”
Description
Study AMB114588 was a phase 2b, open-label, multi-center, long term extension to study AMB112529 
which was only open to patients who had previously participated in the pivotal phase 2b study 
AMB112529, a 24-week (6-month), randomised, open label study comparing safety and efficacy 
parameters for a High dose (7.5 mg or 10 mg, adjusted for body weight) and a Low dose (2.5 mg or 5 
mg, adjusted for body weight) of ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH in paediatric patients aged 8 
years up to 18 years, and in whom continued treatment with ambrisentan was warranted. The primary 
objective was to continue to monitor the safety and tolerability of ambrisentan at 1 of the 4 dose levels 
(2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg) studied in study AMB112529 over an extended period of time. The 
secondary objective was to obtain supportive efficacy data on the paediatric use of ambrisentan.
Participants could remain in study AMB114588 for a minimum of 6 months. Beyond the 6-month period, 
participants could continue in the extension study until one of the following conditions was met:
• The subject turned 18 years of age (when the subject could receive marketed product) or the 
reached pubertal maturity before 18 years of age (ambrisentan could be supplied through a 
named patient or expanded access program until the participant reached 18 years of age).
• The product was approved and available for use in the subject’s age group. 
• Development for use in the paediatric population was discontinued. 
• The subject decided he/she no longer wanted to participate in the study. 
• The investigator considered it in the best interest of the subject to discontinue ambrisentan 
(e.g., for safety reasons). 
Participants were followed for 30 days post their last dose of ambrisentan for the monitoring of 
AEs/SAEs.
Methods
Study participants
Eligible participants for this study had participated in AMB112529, which included the following criteria 
for enrolment: males or females at least 8 years of age and not yet 18 years of age (at the time of 
randomization); a diagnosis of PAH (WHO Group 1) with WHO Class II or III symptoms that were 
idiopathic, familial, secondary to connective tissue disease, or persistent PAH despite surgical repair; 
not taking an ERA; and, no changes to their baseline drug therapy for PAH for the duration of the 
study.
Inclusion criteria
 Had to have complied with the protocol for AMB112529 and completed the Week 24 Visit in 
that study. For participants who did not complete the Week 24 Visit, 1 of 3 criteria had to be 
met:
o Had required additional targeted treatment for PAH due to inadequate response to the 
current treatment or worsening of their clinical condition prior to Week 24 in 
AMB112529.
o Had required a reduction in dose of baseline targeted treatment for PAH after 
ambrisentan was added to the treatment regimen.
o
In the opinion of the investigator, continued treatment with ambrisentan was 
warranted.
-
Females had to be of non-childbearing potential (physiologically incapable of becoming 
pregnant) or, for those with child-bearing potential and sexually active, 2 reliable methods of 
contraception were to be used until study completion and for at least 30 days following the last 
dose of study drug. 
-
Participant or participant’s legal guardian had to be able and willing to give written informed 
consent. As part of the consent and as aligned with the product label, female participants of 
childbearing potential were informed of the risk of teratogenicity and were required to be 
counselled in a developmentally appropriate manner on the importance of pregnancy 
prevention; male participants were informed of the potential risk of testicular tubular atrophy 
and aspermia. 
Exclusion criteria 
-
Participants withdrawn from ambrisentan in AMB112529 or whom did not comply with that 
study’s protocol.
-
-
Females who were pregnant or breastfeeding.
Had severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) at the point of 
transition from AMB112529 into this study.
-
Had clinically significant fluid retention or clinically significant anemia in the opinion of the 
investigator, or participants who were to enter another clinical trial or be treated with another 
investigational product after exiting AMB112529.
Treatments
Participants received 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg of ambrisentan per day, dosed orally (tablet[s] 
in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg strengths swallowed whole), once daily. 
At the time the participant exited AMB112529, the investigator was told the dose of ambrisentan that 
the participant was receiving. Based on the investigator’s best judgement, participant could continue 
on the same dose, the dose could be adjusted downward or upward in 2.5 mg increments to not less 
than 2.5 mg per day  and not more than the lesser of 10 mg per day or 0.25 mg/kg per day. 
Whenever the dose of ambrisentan was changed, 1 of the following reasons for the change was 
required to be recorded:
o
Change in body weight.
o Deterioration of clinical condition.
o
Tolerability issues.
o Other.
Objectives
-
The primary objective of this open-label, long-term extension study was to continue to monitor the 
safety and tolerability of ambrisentan at dose levels studied in study AMB112529 over an extended 
period of time in a paediatric (aged 8 years up to 18 years) PAH population.
-
The secondary objective was to obtain supportive efficacy data on the paediatric use of ambrisentan in 
PAH.

EOS; following Protocol Amendment 03 implementation, 6MWD became an optional 
assessment). Participants with a 20% decrease in 6MWD from AMB112529 Baseline were 
required to return in 1 week to repeat the test to confirm PAH deterioration. Time to clinical 
worsening of PAH, defined as the time to the first occurrence of:
 death (all cause) or placement on active list for lung transplant and/or atrial 
septostomy;
 hospitalization due to PAH deterioration;
 addition of another targeted PAH therapeutic agent (prostanoids, PDE-5i) due to 
deterioration of clinical condition;
 change in dose of ambrisentan or other targeted PAH therapeutic agent (prostanoids, 
PDE-5i) due to deterioration of clinical condition;
 PAH-related deterioration, identified by: increase in WHO Functional Class, 
deterioration in exercise testing (i.e., a 20% decrease in 6MWD on 2 consecutive 
tests 1 week apart), and/or clinical signs or symptoms of right-sided heart failure

Sample size
Sample size was based on the number of participants who had previously completed AMB112529. No 
sample size calculations were performed. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
This was a non-randomized study where the treatment assignment was based on the investigator’s 
best judgement. There was no blinding as AMB114588 was an open-label study. 
Statistical Methods
Statistical Analyses
All programming of tables, figures and listings were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 
version 8.2 or higher. 
There were no hypothesis tests or formal comparisons planned for this study. All safety, efficacy, and 
other data were presented descriptively with summary statistics and graphically (where applicable) by 
dose group (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg) and overall (for the total population). Where available, 
data were summarized by visit. 
For endpoints analyzed as changes from baseline, baseline values were those collected prior to the first 
dose in AMB112529. 
A log transformation was applied to NT-proBNP data and summary measures were based on an 
analysis of log-transformed data which included the geometric mean.
Analysis Sets
The Safety Population, used to analyze safety parameters, consisted of all participants who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. In the Safety Population, participants belonged to a treatment group 
according to the highest ambrisentan dose received in the extension study (ID AMB114588). The 
Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population, used to analyse study population and efficacy parameters, 
consisted of all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In the ITT population, 
participants belonged to a treatment group according to the ambrisentan dose received at the start of 
the extension study (ID AMB114588). The Idiopathic group included participants from the ITT 
Population with an idiopathic etiology of PAH at the start of study treatment in AMB112529. The Non-
idiopathic group included participants from the ITT Population with an etiology of PAH (at the start of 
study treatment in AMB112529) defined as familiar, persistent PAH despite surgical repair, or 
secondary to connective tissue disease. 
Interim Analyses 
There were no planned interim analyses for this study. However, an unplanned interim analysis was 
conducted to support regulatory activities (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000839/X/0061/G). All data 
collected by a pre-determined clinical cut-off date of 23 August 2019 were analyzed in that interim 
analysis.
Results
Participant flow
Of the 41 participants randomized into a Low dose (N=21) or High dose (N=20) group in AMB112529, 
38 participants (93%) entered this long-term extension study. Overall, just over half (55%; n=21) of 
the participants who entered this extension study completed it. Across the dose groups, the proportion 
of completers ranged from 42% (8 of 19 participants for 5 mg group) to 100% (5 of 5 participants for 
10 mg group). 
Just under half of all participants withdrew from the extension study (45%; n=17). The most 
frequently reported reasons for study withdrawal were investigator discretion (18%; n=7) and the 
report of AEs (16%; n=6). The 6 participants withdrawn from the study due to AEs experienced SAEs 
that led to death.

Recruitment
A total of 38 participants, who had previously completed AMB112529, were enrolled into this extension 
study AMB114588.
Participants were recruited across 9 countries: US (n=7 participants), Russian Federation (n=7), 
Argentina (n=5), Hungary (n=5), Japan (n=5), France (n=3), Germany (n=2), Italy (n=2), Spain 
(n=2)  during the study period  (21 Jun 2011 [date of first subject roll-over from study AMB112529] – 
12 Nov 2013 [last subject rolled over to this long-term extension study]). The investigational sites 
were the same as those used in AMB112529.
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics: 
At AMB112529 Baseline, the majority of the study population was 12 to <18 years of age (63%; 24 of 
38 participants), which was also the age stratum represented by the majority of participants in the 5 
mg (63%; 12 of 19 participants), 7.5 mg (80%; 4 of 5 participants), and 10 mg (100%; 5 of 5 
participants) dose groups. The majority of participants (67%; 6 of 9 participants) in the lowest dose 
group (ambrisentan 2.5 mg) were represented by the younger age stratum (8 to 11 years of age). The 
mean/median age of the study population was 11.9/12.5 years (range: 8 to 16 years). The majority 
was female (66%; 25 of 38 participants) and of White/Caucasian/European Heritage (71%; 27 of 38 
participants) with approximately one-third (32%; 12 of 38 participants) of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. 
Five of 38 participants (13%) were of Japanese heritage, 2 of 38 participants (5%) were African 
American/African heritage, and single participants had other geographic ancestry.

Other Baseline Characteristics:
At AMB112529 Baseline, the majority of the study population (84%) and the majority in each dose 
group (79% to 100%) were classified as WHO Functional Class II with the remaining participants 
(16%) meeting WHO Functional Class III. The median (range) 6MWD for the study population was 438 
m (160 m to 600 m).

For 5 mg group, 6MWD data was based on 18 and not 19 participants.
Number analysed
A total of 38 patients were enrolled from the AMB112529 study. At entry to the extension study 
AMB114588, all 38 participants were included in the Safety Population and the ITT Population. Study 
population and efficacy parameters were summarized using the ITT Population which utilized the dose 
group at entry into this extension study, whereas all safety parameters were summarized using the 
Safety Population, which utilized the highest dose received in the extension study. In total, there were 
12 participants who presented in a different dose group for the study population and efficacy 
parameters (ITT Population) compared with the safety parameters (Safety Population) since they were 
titrated up during this extension study and had a ‘highest dose’ of ambrisentan above that of the 
‘initial dose’ at entry.

Efficacy results
All efficacy results are presented by the initial ambrisentan dose group (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg or 10 
mg) at entry into this extension study (ID AMB114588) in accordance with the analysis population 
criteria for the ITT Population.
6MWD: 
From AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study, for the total population at the end of the study 
(n=29 participants in whom data were available), 6MWD increased by a mean/median of 58.4 m/55.5 
m, representing mean and median increases of 17.0% and 13.9%, respectively. 6MWD increases were 
greatest in the 2.5 mg and 5 mg groups.

AMB114588 End of Study, see Table 5. 
Table 5  Summary of 6MWD (ITT Population) 
Source: Table 2.2, Table 2.3, and Table 2.4 
Note: 6MWD results apply to all participants who completed the assessment at the respective timepoint whether or 
not oxygen was used. For the total population, the number of participants requiring oxygen for the 6MWD was 4 of 
38 participants at AMB112529 Baseline, 4 of 37 participants at AMB114588 Study Entry, and 2 of 29 participants at 
AMB114588 End of Study. 
a. At AMB112529 Baseline, there were 5 participants across 3 dose groups (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg) who 
could not complete the 6-minute test (range: 2.3 to 5.8 minutes); however, their data contributed to the 
summary statistics. 
Over half of the study population (58%; 22 of 38 participants) achieved a clinically significant 
improvement in 6MWD (defined as an increase in walk distance by at least 20 m) from AMB112529 
Baseline to last observation, with a comparable proportion in those with an idiopathic etiology of PAH 
at AMB112529 Baseline (58%; 14 of 24 participants) or a non-idiopathic etiology (57%; 8 of 14 
participants). 
The number of participants requiring oxygen for 6MWD was 4 of 37 participants at AMB114588 Study 
Entry (2 each from the 2.5 mg and 5 mg groups), and 2 of 29 participants at AMB114588 End of Study 
(2 from the 2.5 mg group).

Time to Clinical Worsening of PAH: 
In the extension study (ID AMB114588), 11 of 38 participants (29%) across all 4 dose groups 
experienced an occurrence of clinical worsening of PAH based on at least 1 of 5 pre-specified criteria, 
with more than 1 clinical worsening criterion met by 5 of 11 participants (45%). The most frequently 
reported reasons for clinical worsening of PAH were death (6 of 38 participants; 16%) and PAH-related 
deterioration (4 of 38 participants; 11%); PAH-related deterioration was due to an increase from 
AMB112529 baseline in WHO Functional Class (2 participants) and/or clinical signs or symptoms of 
right-sided heart failure (3 participants). Following randomization in AMB112529, the mean/median 
time to clinical worsening of PAH in the extension study was approximately 2.2 years/1.5 years with a 
range of approximately 3 months to 5.2 years. Approximately 70% of the clinical worsening 
occurrences (for 8 of 11 participants) were within 3 years following randomization in AMB112529. In 
this extension study, 7 participants died approximately 3 months to 8 years following randomization in 
AMB112529 with a mean/median time to death of approximately 4.2 years/5.2 years from the start of 
treatment in AMB112529.

Time to the Addition of Another Targeted PAH Therapeutic Agent: 
Over the course of this extension study (ID AMB114588), 17 of 38 participants (45%) across all 4 dose 
groups required the addition of another targeted PAH therapeutic agent (prostanoids, PDE-i) due to 
deterioration of clinical condition (6 participants), lack of beneficial effect with previous therapy (3 
participants), and/or other reason (i.e., ‘other’, ‘electively’) (12 participants). Of these 17 participants, 
8 had additions due to deterioration in clinical condition and/or lack of beneficial effect with previous 
therapy. Overall, considering all reasons for the addition of a PAH therapy, the mean/median time to 
the addition of a PAH therapy was 1.8 years/1.2 years (range of approximately 3 months to 5.2 years) 
from the start of ambrisentan dosing in AMB112529.

Time to Change in Dose of Ambrisentan or Other Targeted PAH Therapeutic Agent due to Deterioration 
of Clinical Condition:
Over the course of this extension study (ID AMB114588), 9 of 38 participants (24%) across all 4 dose 
groups required a change in the dose of ambrisentan or another targeted PAH therapeutic agent 
(prostanoids, PDE-5i) due to deterioration of clinical condition. From the start of ambrisentan dosing in 
AMB112529, the mean/median time to a dose change in ambrisentan or a PAH therapeutic agent due 
to deterioration of clinical condition was 2.6 years/2.1 years (range of approximately 3 months to 6.7 
years). Dose changes appeared to occur earlier in the highest ambrisentan dose group (10 mg) which 
had the lowest median time (approximately 1 year) compared with the other 3 dose groups (2.5 mg, 5 
mg, 7.5 mg) with median times of approximately 2.1 years to 3.6 years.

b.
WHO Functional Class:
Changes from AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study showed an improvement (n=13; 
45%) or no change (n=16; 55%), and no deterioration, in WHO Functional Class for study participants 
in whom data were available (n=29). Of those participants who experienced an improvement, most 
improved by 1 WHO Functional Class category (11 of 13 participants).
Plasma NT-proBNP:
From AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study, there was a geometric mean/median percent 
decrease in NT-proBNP for the total population in whom data was available (n=25), which was largely 
driven by NT-proBNP  reductions in the 2 lower ambrisentan dose groups (2.5 mg and 5 mg). NT-
proBNP levels were below 1200 ng/L at last observation for the majority of the study population (87%; 
33 of 38 participants) with no apparent difference in this finding based on PAH etiology at AMB112529 
Baseline: idiopathic group (83%; 20 of 24 participants) versus non-idiopathic group (93%; 13 of 14 
participants). At any point in the extension study, NT-proBNP levels rose above 1200 ng/L for 
approximately one-third of the study population (29%; 11 of 38 participants) with an apparent 
difference in this finding based on PAH etiology at AMB112529 Baseline: idiopathic group (42%; 10 of 
24 participants) versus non-idiopathic group (7%; 1 of 14 participants).
SF-10 and Missed School Days:
From AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study, mean/median changes in Physical Health and 
Psychosocial Summary scores from the SF-10 were minimal for the total population in whom data was 
available (n=26) and there was an overall decrease, or no change of school days missed due to PAH 
for participants.
Safety results
All safety results are presented according to the highest ambrisentan dose received in the extension 
study (ID AMB114588; 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg or 10 mg).
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were included in summary tables and were defined as 
events that started on or after the date of the first ambrisentan dose in AMB112529 and continued 
(i.e., were unresolved) into this extension study (ID AMB114588) or started on or after the date of the 
first ambrisentan dose in this extension study. Recurring TEAEs (i.e., successive TEAEs classified with 
the same preferred term) for a given participant were only counted once according to maximum 
intensity.
Extent of Exposure:
Exposure by duration for the Safety Population was estimated from the start of dosing in AMB112529. 
For the total population, the range in exposure was approximately 3 months (100 days) to 
approximately 10 years (3640 days) with a median exposure of approximately 3.5 years (1292 days). 
The median number of days of exposure was similar across dose groups; based on these data and the 
interval of days of exposure, there was no apparent trend regarding length of exposure to ambrisentan 
and dose group. The majority of participants in each dose group attending a visit were treatment 
compliant (75% to 100%), defined as receiving 80% and 120% of planned investigational product. 
The overall percentage of visits at which participants were treatment-compliant was 97.9%, with a 
similar result observed across dose groups (93.4% to 100%).
For the summary of Exposure to Investigational Product (Safety Population), see Table 11.

Abbreviations: N= Number of participants; () = percentage

a. Since 360 days was used in the source output to establish intervals of exposure, a conversion factor of 
360 was used to estimate years from days for the purpose of this table
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Overall:
TEAEs were experienced by the majority of the study population (89%; n=34) and the majority in each 
dose group (81% to 100%). Overall, the occurrence of TEAEs did not appear to be dose-dependent. 
TEAE occurrence did not appear to be dependent on PAH etiology at AMB112529 Baseline given the 
similar occurrence of TEAEs in the idiopathic group (92%; 22 of 24 participants) and non-idiopathic 
group (86%; 12 of 14 participants). There appeared to be a higher occurrence of TEAEs in participants 
on a PAH therapy (PDE-5i and/or prostanoids) during the extension study (97%; 28 of 29 participants) 
versus those not on a PAH therapy (67%; 6 of 9 participants). 
One TEAE (swelling face; 10 mg) led to a dose decrease; no other TEAEs led to a dose decrease or 
increase. TEAEs that led to a dose interruption/delay were all reported for the same participant (2.5 
mg): deafness (non-serious), and atrioventricular block complete, ALT increased, and hypotension (all 
serious). 
There were 6 participants across 3 ambrisentan dose groups (5 mg, 7.5 mg and 10 mg) who were 
withdrawn from the extension study due to a TEAE; all of these TEAEs were serious and led to death. 
Aside from participants who experienced fatal serious TEAEs, no other participants permanently 
discontinued the study or investigational product due to TEAEs.
Most Frequent Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events:
Common TEAEs were defined as occurring in ≥5% of the study population (i.e., at least 2 participants, 
irrespective of dose group). The most common TEAEs in this extension study were upper respiratory 
tract infection (11 of 38 participants; 29%), nasopharyngitis (9 of 38 participants; 24%), and 
headache (7 of 38 participants; 18%). Their onset in the extension study was within the first 2 years 
(headache) or 4 years (upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis) of dosing starting from 
AMB112529 Baseline.

Population (Safety Population)

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Maximum Intensity:
TEAEs were rated as mild or moderate in maximum intensity for the majority of the study population 
(58%) and by at least half of participants in each dose group (50% to 75%). A total of 26 moderate 
TEAEs were experienced by 12 of 38 participants (32%) across all 4 dose groups; none were regarded 
as related to the investigational product and their occurrence did not appear to be dose-dependent. Of 
the 26 severe TEAEs, 18 were considered SAEs (6 of which had a fatal outcome).

Abbreviations: N= Number of participants; ()= percentage
Source: Table AMB114588 3.4 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to the Investigational Product: 
Approximately 39% (15 of 38 patients) of the study population and 25% to 50% in each dose group 
experienced a TEAE that was considered related to the investigational product. Related TEAEs were 
more common in the higher ambrisentan dose groups (7.5 mg [50%] and 10 mg [50%]) as compared 
with the lower ambrisentan dose groups (2.5 mg [25%] and 5 mg [31%]; differences in frequency did 
not appear to apply to a system organ class or TEAE specifically.

Deaths: 
In the extension study, TEAEs that were fatal were experienced by 7 participants across 3 dose groups 
(Safety Population; 5 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10 mg). Fatal serious TEAEs were PAH (n=2; 10 mg), cardiac 
failure acute (n=2; 5 mg; for 1 of these participants, the SAE began in AMB112529), acute right 
ventricular failure (n=1; 5 mg), COVID-19 (n=1; 5 mg), and failure to thrive (n=1; 7.5 mg). All 
serious TEAEs that resulted in death led to withdrawal from the study (n=6) with the exception of 1 
participant who died from PAH after completing the treatment period and the study due to reaching the 
age of 18. None of the deaths were considered related to the investigational product by the 
investigator. 
Other Serious Adverse Events:
In this extension study (ID AMB114588), 42 SAEs were experienced by just over half of the study 
population (21 participants; 55%) across all dose groups. A greater proportion of participants 
experienced SAEs in the higher ambrisentan dose groups (7.5 mg [67%] and 10 mg [67%]) as 
compared with the lower ambrisentan dose groups (2.5 mg [50%] and 5 mg [44%]). SAEs occurred 
more commonly in the idiopathic group (63%; 15 of 24 participants) as compared with the non-
idiopathic group (43%; 6 of 14 participants) and more commonly in participants on a PAH therapy 
(prostanoids and/or PDE-5i) during the extension study (62%; 18 of 29 participants) versus those not 
on a PAH therapy (33%; 3 of 9 participants). None of the SAEs were considered related to the 
investigational product by the investigator. Excluding the 7 SAEs that were fatal, the remaining SAEs, 
all non-fatal, resolved during the study with the exception of the following SAEs, which occurred for the 
same participant (5 mg) and were considered ‘not recovered/not resolved’: pulmonary hemorrhage, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and gastric hemorrhage. This participant subsequently died 
from COVID-19 which was diagnosed prior to the onset of these 3 SAEs.

Abbreviations: N= Number of participants; () = percentage

Adverse Events of Special Interest:
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were anemia, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity, hypotension, 
male infertility, edema, and fluid retention. AESI were experienced by approximately half of the study 
population (53%; n=20) and at least half of participants in each dose group (50% to 58%). No AESI 
led to an ambrisentan dose change or permanent discontinuation of ambrisentan or withdrawal from 
the study. The most common AESI was anemia (6 participants [16%], 11 events) which occurred 
across 2 dose groups (5 mg and 10 mg). For 2 participants, 3 events of anemia were considered 
related to the investigational product. The majority of events resolved (all but 1, which was considered 
intermittent and occurred in a participant with a past medical history of anemia prior to ambrisentan 
exposure).

Liver Events:
Protocol-defined liver chemistry stopping criteria for ALT was met by 1 participant (2.5 mg) in the 
extension study. The ALT elevation was reported as severe in intensity and as a SAE and occurred 
approximately 2 years following the first dose. Two other SAEs that were also severe in intensity 
contemporaneously occurred for this participant (atrioventricular block complete and hypotension). All 
3 SAEs led to a temporary dose interruption and resolved within 23 days; none were regarded as 
related to the investigational product by the investigator. Four participants had a TEAE related to liver 
function tests (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, LDH, and transaminases) or hepatobiliary disorders. Elevated 
AST and bilirubin (both mild in intensity and non-serious) reported for 1 participant (10 mg) were 
considered related to the study drug. Two of these 4 participants met laboratory values of potential 
clinical concern (PCC) for ALT and GGT (participant who met protocol-defined stopping criteria) or ALT 
and AST.
Neutropenia:
One participant (5 mg group) experienced a TEAE of neutropenia that was mild in intensity, non-
serious, not regarded as related to the investigational product and did not lead to a dose change. 
Onset of neutropenia was in the initial AMB112529 study approximately 49 days after the first dose 
and was intermittent, continuing into the extension study, with a reported duration of 144 days. Total 
neutrophils returned to normal by the End of Study.
Clinical Chemistry Changes of Potential Clinical Concern:
Values of Potential Clinical Concern (PCC) were determined for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, creatinine, and 
GGT. Over the course of this extension study (Study Entry to End of Study), 6 participants (16%) 
across 3 dose groups (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg) reached levels of PCC (i.e., fell above pre-defined PCC 
reference ranges) for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and/or GGT with no participants reaching levels of PCC 
for creatinine. Two of these participants had TEAEs related to liver function tests with the remaining 4 
participants not reporting corresponding TEAEs.
Hematological Changes of Potential Clinical Concern:
Values of PCC were determined for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Over the course of this 
extension study (Study Entry to End of Study), 9 participants (24%) across 2 ambrisentan dose groups 
(5 mg, 10 mg) reached levels of PCC (i.e., fell above and/or below predefined PCC reference ranges) 
for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. Four participants (11%) had low hemoglobin and/or 
hematocrit of PCC, with low values of both parameters observed in 3 of these participants.
Physical Examination:
No clinically relevant findings were observed related to physical examinations. At the end of the 
extension study, 93% of the remaining participants (27 of 29 participants) had normal liver size and 
jugular venous pressure and no participants had peripheral edema. Ascites was reported for 2 of 29 
participants (7%). The mean oxygen saturation level for the remaining 29 participants was 96.8% 
(range: 90% to 100%).
Vital Sign Changes of Potential Clinical Concern:
Levels of PCC were determined for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. Over 
the course of this extension study (Entry to End of Study), values of PCC for vital signs were observed 
for 7 participants (5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg) for heart rate (2 participants exceeded the reference range 
and 4 participants fell below the reference range) and systolic blood pressure (2 participants fell below 
the reference range). For the remaining 2 parameters (diastolic blood pressure and weight), no 
participants reached levels of PCC.
12-lead Electrocardiograms:
Over the course of this extension study (Entry to End of Study), ‘abnormal, clinically significant’ 12-
lead ECGs were recorded for a total of 6 participants (16%) across 3 dose groups (5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 
mg). Abnormal, clinically significant 12-lead ECGs were also observed for the majority of these 
participants (4 of 6) at AMB112529 Baseline. At End of Study, no remaining participants had 
‘abnormal, clinically significant’ 12-ECG assessments.
Pubertal Development and Plasma Endocrinology Parameters:
While 40% of females and 38% of males were pre-adolescent at the start of the initial study (ID 
AMB112529), the proportion reduced to 5% of females and no males by the end of the extension 
study. Pubertal assessments conducted at 20 years of age showed that all females (n=10) were at 
Stage 4 or Stage 5 for pubertal development and all males (n=4) were at Stage 5. No clinically 
relevant changes in plasma endocrinology parameters were observed from AMB112529 Baseline to the 
end of the extension study for both females and males.
Time to Change in Dose of Ambrisentan or Other Targeted PAH Therapeutic Agent due to Tolerability:
Over the course of this extension study (ID AMB114588), 7 participants (18%) across all 4 dose 
groups were reported as having a change in their dose of ambrisentan or another targeted PAH 
therapeutic agent (prostanoids, PDE-5i) due to tolerability issues. Based on the data of 6 participants 
who had a dose change in ambrisentan (n=2) or a PAH agent (n=4) during the extension study due to 
tolerability issues (and excluding the 1 participant [2.5 mg] who discontinued ambrisentan due to 
tolerability but had no dose changes in the extension study), dose changes were initiated after 
approximately 1 year and up to 6 years of dosing from the start of dosing in AMB112529. Time to a 
dose change was notably higher in the 10 mg group (median of approximately 4 years) as compared to 
lower dose groups (medians of approximately 1 year).
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
Ambrisentan is a selective endothelium receptor antagonist (ERA) currently approved by the European 
Comission as 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets for oral use for the treatment of PAH in 
adults, adolescents and children (aged 8 to less than 18 years) of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III 
including use in combination treatment. 
This Article 46 procedure of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, concerns the submission of a final study 
report for study AMB114588 (EudraCT Number: 2010-021572-29) titled “An open-label, long term 
extension study for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in paediatric patients aged 8 years 
up to 18 years who have participated in AMB112529 and in whom continued treatment with 
ambrisentan is desired” is part of a clinical development program. The variation application consisting 
of the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 
second quartile 2023. Please note that a final study report for the pivotal study AMB112529 as well as 
an interim report for its extension study AMB114588 (data cut-off date: 23 Aug 2019) was previously 
submitted for the procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000839/X/0061/G, consisting of an extension of the 
marketing authorisation to introduce a new strength (2.5 mg film-coated tablet), grouped with an 
extension of indication to include treatment of PAH in adolescents and children (8 to less than 18 
years). The approval of the paediatric indication was issued on 22 July 2021.
AMB114588 was a phase 2b, open-label, long-term extension study of the pivotal phase 2b, 24-week 
(6-month), randomized, open-label study AMB112529. This extension study was performed to monitor 
the safety and tolerability as well as obtaining supportive efficacy data of ambrisentan film-coated 
tablet[s] in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg strengths, at 1 of the 4 dose levels (2.5 mg or 5 mg for the Low 
dose group and 7.5 mg or 10 mg for the High dose group; adjusted for body weight) studied in study 
AMB112529, in subjects aged 8 years up to 18 years with PAH who have participated in AMB112529. 
Participants could remain in study AMB114588 for a minimum of 6 months. Beyond the 6-month 
period, participants could continue in the extension study until it was met 1 of 5 pre-specified 
conditions. Participants were followed for 30 days post their last dose of ambrisentan for the 
monitoring of AEs/SAEs. The safety endpoints were Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs), Hematology and clinical chemistry, Liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, and total bilirubin), 
physical examination, vital signs, pubertal development, endocrinology assessments and time to a 
change in the dose of ambrisentan or other targeted PAH therapeutic agents (prostanoids, PDE-5i) due 
to tolerability issues. The efficacy endpoints measured were 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from 
baseline to End of the Study, time to clinical worsening of PAH, time to addition of another targeted 
PAH therapeutic agent(s), time to change in dose of ambrisentan or other targeted PAH therapeutic 
agents (prostanoids, PDE-5i) due to deterioration of clinical condition, WHO Functional Class, Plasma 
NT-proBNP and other Health outcomes assessments as SF-10 Health Survey for Children and missed 
school days. The study design and duration as well as the proposed objectives seem adequate for an 
extension study to describe the long-term effects of ambisentran in a target population.
Of the 41 participants randomized into a Low dose or High dose group in AMB112529, 38 participants 
(93%) entered this long-term extension study. The majority of the study population was 12 to <18 
years of age (63%; 24/38 participants), which was also the age stratum represented by the majority 
of participants in the 5 mg (63%; 12/19 participants), 7.5 mg (80%; 4/5 participants), and 10 mg 
(100%; 5/5 participants) dose groups. The majority of participants (67%; 6/9 participants) in the 
lowest ambrisentan dose group (ambrisentan 2.5 mg) were represented by the younger age stratum 
(8 to 11 years of age). The mean/median age of the study population was 11.9/12.5 years (range: 8 
to 16 years). The majority was female (66%) and of White/Caucasian/European Heritage (71%) with 
approximately one-third (32%) of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. 
Overall, just over half (55%; n=21) of the participants who entered this extension study completed it. 
The most frequently reported reasons for study withdrawal were investigator discretion (18%; n=7) 
and the report of AEs (16%; n=6). 
Regarding the safety and tolerability of ambrisentan data in the long-term treatment, the most 
reported TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (11 of 38 participants; 29%), nasopharyngitis (9 
of 38 participants; 24%), and headache (7 of 38 participants; 18%). These TEAEs were previously 
reported in the initial study and are consistent with product labelling for the adult population. Despite 
affecting a large number of patients, none of these adverse effects represented a serious health 
problem. A total of 26 severe TEAEs were experienced by 12 of 38 participants (32%) across all 4 dose 
groups. Of the 26 severe TEAEs, 18 were considered SAEs (6 of which had a fatal outcome). None 
were regarded as related to the investigational product as it could be considered they were due to 
events that reflect the underlying disease features and complications arising during the natural disease 
course. On the other hand, approximately 39% (15 of 38 patients) of the study population and 25% to 
50% in each dose group experienced a TEAE that was considered related to the investigational 
product. Related TEAEs were more common in the higher dose groups (7.5 mg [50%] and 10 mg 
[50%]) as compared with the lower dose groups (2.5 mg [25%] and 5 mg [31%], so these AEs seem 
dose-dependent. The most frequently reported AESI was anemia (6 participants [16%], 11 events), 
with the majority resolving and none leading to withdrawal from ambrisentan treatment or the study. 
The range of time to death (approximately 3 months to 8 years from AMB112529 Baseline) is in line 
with the population studied and there was no evidence of a contemporaneous or dose relationship. No 
clinically relevant findings were observed related to physical examinations and pubertal assessments. 
Regarding the efficacy measures, change from baseline of the initial study (ID AMB112529) to the end 
of the extension study, in participants in whom data were available (n=29), 6MWD increased by a 
mean/median of 58.4 m/55.5 m, representing mean and median increases of 17.0% and 13.9%, 
respectively. Moreover, half of the study population (58%) achieved a clinically significant 
improvement in 6MWD with a comparable proportion in those with an idiopathic etiology of PAH (58%) 
or non-idiopathic etiology (57%). Although the obtained efficacy results appear to support an 
improvement in the measured efficacy endpoints, the limited sample size and the lack of a control 
group makes interpretation difficult.
The clinical course of the population studied showed approximately 29% of participants (11/38 
participants), across all 4 dose groups, experienced an occurrence of clinical worsening of PAH based 
on at least 1 of 5 pre-specified criteria, with more than 1 clinical worsening criterion met by 45% 
participants (5/11 participants). Over half of the 11 participants met the clinical worsening criterion of 
death (6/11 participants), and over one-third (4/11 participants) met the criterion of PAH-related 
deterioration. Moreover, almost one half of participants (45%; 17/38 participants) required addition of 
another PAH targeted therapy (for any reason) alongside their ambrisentan treatment, of which 8 
participants had additions due to deterioration in clinical condition and/or lack of beneficial effect with 
previous therapies. Time to clinical worsening was variable, with no evidence of a contemporaneous or 
dose relationship. Change in the dose of ambrisentan or concurrent targeted PAH therapy in the 
extension study due to deterioration of clinical condition was reported for approximately one quarter of 
participants (24%; 9/38 participants) with changes in dose occurring over a wide range of time from 
the start of ambrisentan treatment in the initial study (approximately 3 months to 6.7 years). Changes 
from AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study showed an improvement (n=13; 45%) or no 
change (n=16; 55%), and no deterioration, in WHO Functional Class for study participants in whom 
data were available (n=29). From AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study, there was a 
geometric mean/median percent decrease in NT-proBNP for the total population in whom data was 
available (n=25), which was largely driven by NT-proBNP reductions in the 2 lower ambrisentan dose 
groups (2.5 mg and 5 mg). From AMB112529 Baseline to AMB114588 End of Study, mean/median 
changes in Physical Health and Psychosocial Summary scores from the SF-10 were minimal for the 
total population in whom data was available (n=26) and there was an overall decrease, or no change 
of School Days Missed due to PAH for participants. However, despite the positive trend for benefit in 
these secondary outcomes, the significant amount of missing data (29%, 34% and 12% respectively), 
precludes a definitive conclusion on the effect of ambrisentan on improvement in respiratory function 
or decrease in NT-proBNP or in Physical Health-School Days Missed respectively.
In summary, the observed safety and efficacy results of the study AMB114588 are in line with the EU 
SmPC of ambrisentan. As such, no regulatory action required at this time.
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH submitted a final study report 
for study AMB114588 (EudraCT Number: 2010-021572-29) titled “An open-label, long term extension 
study for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in paediatric patients aged 8 years up to 18 
years who have participated in AMB112529 and in whom continued treatment with ambrisentan is 
desired”.
A final study report for the pivotal study AMB112529 as well as an interim report for its extension 
study AMB114588 (data cut-off date: 23 Aug 2019) was previously submitted for the procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/000839/X/0061/G, consisting of an extension of the marketing authorisation to introduce a 
new strength (2.5 mg film-coated tablet), grouped with an extension of indication to include treatment 
of PAH in adolescents and children (8 to less than 18 years). The approval of the paediatric indication 
was issued on 22 July 2021.
Since the provided results for ambrisentan are in line with the approved product information in the EU, 
no regulatory action required at this point. 
A variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is 
expected to be submitted by second quartile 2023, which is agreed by the Rapporteur.
  Fulfilled:
No regulatory action required.

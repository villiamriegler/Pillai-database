SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Olazax Disperzi 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg orodispersible tablets is a generic medicinal 
product containing olanzapine as active substance. 
The reference medicinal products are Zyprexa and Zyprexa Velotab which contain olanzapine.  
Olanzapine,  a  thienobenzodiazepine  derivative,  belongs  to  class  of  second  generation  derivative 
antipsychotic  agents,  the  so-called  atypical  antipsychotics.  As  atypical  antipsychotics  are  generally 
classified  those  drugs,  which  in  contrast  to  classical  antipsychotics  (e.g.  haloperidol),  have  greater 
affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than for dopamine D2 receptors and cause fewer extrapyramidal 
symptoms (EPS).  
The efficacy and safety of olanzapine has been demonstrated in randomised, placebo-controlled and 
comparative trials in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and also as monotherapy or in 
combination with mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with 
bipolar disorder. A summary of these studies may be found in the EPAR of Zyprexa. 
The  indication  proposed  for  Olazax  Disperzi  is  the  same  as  authorized  for  the  reference  medicinal 
product Zyprexa. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Olazax Disperzi is presented in the form of orodispersible tablets. The tablets contain 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 
10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg of olanzapine as active substance. Other ingredients are defined in the SPC 
section 6.1. 
It is packaged into blisters made of Al/Al. 
Active Substance 
The  chemical  name  of  olanzapine  is:  (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10h-thieno[2 ,3-b]  [1,5] 
benzodiazepine,  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula  C17H20N4S  and  relative  molecular  mass 
312.44. It is pale yellow to yellow crystalline odourless powder, practically insoluble in water, freely 
soluble in chloroform, soluble in dichloromethane and very slightly soluble in methanol. Solubility in 
aqueous  media  decreases  with  increasing  of  pH.  Olanzapine  exists  in  many  polymorphic  forms; 
polymorph I is consistently manufactured by the current synthesis.  
• 
Manufacture 
The  manufacturing  of  olanzapine  consists  of  five  synthetic  steps  leading  to  olanzapine  Form-I.  An 
ASMF  has  been  submitted.  Critical  process  parameters  of  all  stages  with  appropriate  justification 
have  been  described.  Starting  materials  are  described  in  sufficient  detail  as  well  as  synthetic 
intermediates. 
• 
Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  as  tested  by  the  finished  product  manufacturer  includes  tests  for 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR),  solubility  (Ph.Eur.),  loss  on  drying  (Ph.Eur.),  residue  on 
ignition (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
Analytical results were provided for three batches. All results complied with specifications claimed.

• 
Stability 
The stability studies have been carried out on three batches of active substance in long-term (25°C/60 
%  RH)  and  in  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75%  RH).  The  stability  samples  have  been  stored  in  a 
mini-size simulation of the original packaging.  
Forced degradation studies with Olanzapine are performed by treatment with heat, under acidic and 
alkaline conditions, under oxidizing conditions, humidity as well as under light stress conditions.  
The  active  substance  remained  stable  and  within  the  specifications  throughout  the  proposed  re-test 
period  in  long  term  conditions  and  up  to  three  months  in  accelerated  conditions.  The  content  of 
unidentified impurity exceeds the specification NMT 0.10%. In all case, the total impurities remain 
under  the  limit  (NMT  0.50%).  Results  demonstrated  that  polymorphic  form  I  remains  unchanged 
throughout  the proposed re-test period. All others parameters are well within the specification limit 
under both accelerated and long term conditions.  
Based on the provided stability data the claimed re-test period and storage conditions can be accepted. 
Medicinal Product 
• 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The overall target was to produce a tablet bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product Zyprexa 
10 mg film-coated tablets and Zyprexa Velotabs 10 mg orodispersible tablets. 
The  formulation  development  was  initiated  taking  into  account  potential  stability  problems  seen  in 
other  benzodiazepines,  the  solubility  of  the  active  substance  and  the  low  strength  of  the  finished 
product.  
The  drug  substance  is  known  to  be  sensitive  to  moisture.  For  this  reason,  a  simple  mixing  direct 
compression process was selected. 
Olanzapine  is  practically  insoluble  in  water,  however  it  has  been  demonstrated  by  appropriate 
solubility studies that olanzapine even in the 20 mg tablets - highest strength - was completely soluble 
in 250 ml of a range of media. 
The  existence  of  different  polymorphic  forms  has  been  demonstrated  for  olanzapine.  The  drug 
substance  manufacturer  form  is  form  I,  as  characterised  by  XRD.  Active  substance  particle  size  is 
controlled by appropriate specification. 
The  excipients  used  Olazax  Disperzi  orodispersible  tablets  are  well  known and widely used for the 
manufacture of solid dosage forms. Appropriate drug substance - excipient compatibility studies have 
been carried out with different excipients in order to screen suitable ones. No significant change was 
observed in the impurity levels during these studies. 
A comparative study of impurities profiles has been performed for 5 mg and 10 mg strengths between 
1 pilot batch of generic product and one batch of reference product Zyprexa tablet. For the 5 mg and 
10 mg strengths one batch of reference product Zyprexa Velotab has also been compared. 
No  significant  difference  is  observed  for  immediate  release  tablet  between  the  generic  and  the 
reference  product  Zyprexa  tablet  whereas  the  level  of  impurities  in  Zyprexa  Velotab  was  found 
slightly higher. 
• 
Manufacture of the Product 
The proposed method of manufacture is dry mixing and direct compression. 
Validation  has  been  performed  on  3  industrial  batches  for  each  of  the  strengths.  All  the  described 
parameters  were  consistent  and  within  specifications.  The  process  can  then  be  considered  as 
sufficiently validated. 
• 
Product Specification  
The  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  tests  for appearance (visual), identification 
(HPLC,  UV,  at  release  only),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (PhEur,  at  release  only),  average  tablet 
weight  (in-house,  at  release  only),  resistance  to  crushing  (PhEur),  friability  (PhEur),  disintegration 
(PhEur), dissolution (PhEur), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), water content (Karl-Fischer) 
and microbiological quality (PhEur- Non-routine test). 
7/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results  from  three  industrial  scale  batches  were  provided  for  each  strength.  All  presented  batches 
comply with the proposed specification and demonstrate consistent manufacture. 
• 
Adventitious Agents 
None of the excipients are of human or animal origin. 
• 
Stability of the Product 
Three consecutive batches of each strength of Olazax Disperzi orodispersible tablets have been stored 
under the following conditions and studied in stability studies: long-term (25°C ± 2°C, 60% RH ± 5% 
RH)  for  up  to  18  months,  accelerated  (40°C  ±  2°C,  75%  RH  ±  5%  RH)  for  up  to  6  months  and 
intermediate Conditions (30°C ± 2°C, 65% RH ± 5% RH) up to 12 months. The stability studies are 
carried out in accordance with the current ICH/CPMP guidelines. 
Except in accelerated conditions, where a significant increase of one identified impurity is observed 
with results out of specifications for the low strength, results in real time condition and intermediate 
conditions remain within specifications for all tested batches. 
Photostability study according to the guideline was provided and from the results it can be concluded 
that the finished product is photostable when stored in the proposed packaging.  
In conclusion the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are accepted when 
the product stored in the proposed packaging. 
Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.3  Non-Clinical aspects   
This  application  is  being  made  under  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive  2004/27/EC, 
Article 10.1 (generic) for Olazax Disperzi 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg orodispersible tablets, and 
Article  10.3  (hybrid)  for  Olazax  Disperzi  7.5  mg  orodispersible  tablets  as  the  additional  strength 
7.5 mg is not authorized for reference product Zyprexa Velotab. 
No  further  non-  clinical  studies  are  required  and  the  applicant  justified  why  no  such  data  was 
provided.  
The  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  olanzapine  are  well 
characterised.  
The  non-clinical  overview,  based  on  scientific  literature  on  the  pre-clinical  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology was considered adequate.  
No environmental risk assessment is required as it is not anticipated that there will be additional use 
of products containing olanzapine as compared to current usage. Therefore it is considered that there 
is no additional risk to the environment from this medicinal product.  
Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects 
There  are  no  non-clinical  objections  to  approve  Olazax  Disperzi  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg  and 
20 mg orodispersible tablets.

2.4  Clinical Aspects  
Introduction 
This application concerns a generic medicinal product that contains five different strengths of 5 mg, 
7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg  and  20  mg  olanzapine  in  orodispersible  tablets  submitted  by  Glenmark 
Pharmaceuticals s.r.o. 
This  application  is  being  made  under  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive  2004/27/EC, 
Article 10.1 (generic) for Olazax Disperzi 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg orodispersible tablets, and 
Article  10.3  (hybrid)  for  Olazax  Disperzi  7.5  mg  orodispersible  tablets  as  the  additional  strength 
7.5 mg is not authorized for reference product Zyprexa Velotab.   
The reference medicinal product authorised for not less than 6/10 years in the EEA is: 
- for strengths 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg Zyprexa from Eli Lilly Nederland BV (EU/1/96/022/004-
020-024-030-008-009-010-026-032-012-021-027-033-014-022-028-034); 
-  for  the  7.5  mg  strength  -  Zyprexa  (EU/1/96/022/006,  EU/1/96/022/011,  EU/1/96/022/025, 
EU/1/96/022/031). 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study (No 60679) with the 
intermediate strength of 10 mg and requested a biowaiver for other strengths.  
Scientific advice was not sought for the development programme. For the clinical assessment the Note 
for Guidance on Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in 
its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence 
Guidelines (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) are of relevance. 
The SmPC is in line with that of the reference products Zyprexa Velotab and Zyprexa. 
GCP aspects 
The  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  outside  EU  by  a  contract  research  organisation  based  in 
Canada. The study was compliant with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. 
In accordance to Art 8(3)(ib) of the amended Directive, and Art 6.1 of the Regulation EC/726/2004, 
the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials that were conducted outside the 
EU were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The French authorities (AFSSAPS) inspected the clinical and the analytical facilities in October 2002 
with  a  positive  outcome.  Furthermore,  those  facilities  were  inspected  by  Portuguese  authorities 
(INFARMED) and no major issues were raised. 
Clinical studies 
One  bioequivalence  study  (BE)  with  olanzapine  10  mg  tablets  has  been  undertaken  by  the  Sponsor 
Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited.  
The bioequivalence study is the same for the concurrent application made for Olazax. 
An  appropriate  literature  review  has  been  presented  by  the  clinical  expert  supporting  the  use  of 
olanzapine  in  the  proposed  indications,  which  are  identical  to  those  approved  centrally  for  the 
reference products.  
No safety clinical studies have been undertaken to support the application. The bioequivalence study 
provided some safety results that are discussed below.

Methods 
STUDY DESIGN 
This was a single centre, open-label, single-dose, randomised, 3-way crossover bioequivalence study, 
performed under fasting conditions.  
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  rate  and  extent  of  absorption  of  olanzapine  10  mg 
tablets  manufactured  by  Glenmark  Generics  Ltd,  India  against  Zyprexa  10  mg  coated  tablets  (Eli 
Lilly, UK) and Zyprexa Velotab 10 mg orodispersible tablets (Eli Lilly, UK). 
Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 10 hours prior to drug administration, until 
after  the  72-hour  post-dose  blood  draw,  in  each  period.  The  treatment  phases  were  separated  by 
washout periods of 21 days. 
In  each  period,  subjects  received  the  test  or  one  of  the  reference  products  (Reference  Product  1  – 
Zyprexa  Velotab  10  mg  orodispersible  tablets;  Reference  Product  2  –  Zyprexa  10  mg  film-coated 
tablet) as a single oral dose of one tablet containing 10 mg of olanzapine in the morning of Day 1. 
The bioequivalence study was performed under fasting conditions following a 10-hour overnight fast. 
Subjects  were  required  to  abstain  from  food  or  drink  containing  xanthine  derivatives  or  xanthine-
related compounds and energy drinks from 48 hours prior to drug administration and until the end of 
sample  collection  in  each  period  (168-hour  post-dose  draw);  alcohol-based  products  from  24  hours 
prior  to  drug  administration  and  until  the  end  of  sample  collection  in  each  period,  and  food  or 
beverages containing grapefruit or pomelo products, natural food supplements, and vitamins from 7 
days prior to drug administration and until the end of sample collection in each period. Subjects were 
advised  not  to  use  soft  or  hard  drugs  or  any  tobacco  products  during  the  study.  Vigorous  physical 
activity  was  prohibited  at  all  times  during  the  confinements.  Subjects  were  allowed  to  leave  the 
clinical site after the 72-hour blood draw. 
Zyprexa (Reference Product 2) was swallowed with a glass of water (240 ml). The generic product 
(Test product) and Zyprexa Velotab (Reference Product 1) were administered by placing the tablet on

POPULATION STUDIED   
Based  on  data  from  literature,  the  intra-subject  coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  of  olanzapine  (by  oral 
route) was expected to be approximately 8% and 15% for AUC and Cmax respectively. Thus assuming 
that  the  actual  ratio  of  AUC  and  Cmax  is  within  0.90  and  1.11,  it  was  estimated  that  the  minimum 
number  of  subjects  to  be  included  to  meet  the  80-125%  confidence  interval  limits  was  about  26. 
Therefore, it was planned to include 30 subjects in order to allow for drop-outs. 
A total of 30 subjects (11 females and 19 males) were included in the study. Subjects were healthy, 
adult  non-smokers,  aged  ≥  18  and  ≤  55  years  with  body  mass  indices  ≥  19.0  and  <  30.0  kg/m2. 
Adequate inclusion/exclusion criteria were followed.  
Twenty  six  patients  finished  the  entire  study  and  were  included  in  the  PK  analysis.  Two  subjects 
withdrew  for  personal  reasons  and  two  other  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  adverse  events.  All 
withdrawals and drop-outs were adequately documented.  
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
A  detailed  and  comprehensive  description  of  the  operative  procedures  is  provided  in  the  submitted 
documentation. A validation report is also provided.  
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES  
For  deriving  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUC0→t,  AUCinf,  Cmax,  Tmax,  T1/2,  Kel  a  non-compartmental 
analysis was performed. AUC from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUC0→t) 
was  calculated  by  mean  of  the  linear  trapezoidal  rule.  Extrapolation  to  infinity  (AUCinf)  was 
calculated  as  a  sum  of  AUC0→t  plus  the  ratio  of  the  last  measurable  plasma  concentration  to  the 
elimination rate constant. 
STATISTICAL METHODS 
The statistical part of the study was conducted using Win Nonlin software. Parametric ANOVAs on 
ln-transformed  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  was  carried  out.  The  statistical  model  included  sequence, 
period  and  treatment  factors  as  fixed  effects  and  subject  within  sequence  as  random  effect.  A  non 
parametric  test  (Friedman’s  Test)  was  carried  out  to  compare  Tmax.  Bioequivalence  could  be 
concluded if the 90 % CI of the ratio of the least square means of the test to reference products was 
within 80-125 % for AUC and Cmax. No statement was made for Tmax.  
All these are conventional methods, and were therefore agreed by the CHMP.

Conclusions 
The  CIs  of  all  PK  parameters  were  within  the  acceptance  range,  hence  the  bioequivalence  of  the 
generic product to the originator could be considered demonstrated for 10 mg tablet.  
Protocol  deviations  (mainly  blood  sampling  volume  deviation  and  repeated  blood  pressure 
measurements) were judged to have no significant influence on bioequivalence assessment. 
Transferability of study results to other strengths 
The  single  bioequivalence  study  submitted  by  the  applicant  tested  the  10  mg  intermediate  strength. 
Biowaiver was requested for the higher 20 and 15 mg as well as the lower 7.5 mg, 5 mg strengths in 
accordance  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), section 5.4. To grant a waiver the following criteria should be fulfilled:  
1. The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process; 
2. The drug input has been shown to be linear over the therapeutic dose range; 
3. The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
4. The ratio between amounts of the active substance and excipients is the same; 
5.  The  dissolution  profiles  are  similar  under  identical  conditions  for  the additional strength and the 
strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
Not all these criteria were satisfied in the initial application; hence the CHMP requested the applicant 
to demonstrate similarity of the in vitro dissolution of 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg strengths at 
different pH values. The applicant has provided all the requested dissolution profiles of all strengths 
in three media (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8), showing that the formulation released 85% olanzapine 
within 15 minutes. The CHMP considered the answer satisfactory and concluded that these strengths 
can  be  deemed  bioequivalent  to  the  originator.  Consequently,  the  biowaiver  was  accepted  by  the 
CHMP as all conditions to request a biowaiver were deemed to have been fulfilled.

2.5  Pharmacovigilance  
• 
PSUR 
The PSUR submission schedule for all strengths should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference 
product. 
• 
Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before 
the product is placed on the market. 
The company should ensure that the pharmacovigilance activities are in line with the current safety 
measures  applied  to  the  reference  medicinal  product.  Therefore,  the  MAH  should  commit  to  the 
subsequent follow-up or other measures: 
1. The MAH should further continue to monitor and review in the PSURs: 
- reports of patients younger that 18 years old;  
- reports of patients receiving long-term (>1 year) treatment with olanzapine should be continued; 
-  reports  on  myocarditis,  cardiomyopathy  and  myocardial  damage  in  association  with  olanzapine 
treatment. 
2.  The  MAH  should  continue  to  monitor  following  reports  as  a  part  of  routine  pharmacovigilance 
activities: 
- serious haematological reactions in  association with olanzapine treatment; 
- venous thromboembolism in association with olanzapine treatment; 
- rhabdomyolysis in association with olanzapine treatment; 
- pregnancy and lactation in patients exposed to olanzapine; 
- hypothyroidism and hyponatraemia/SIADH/Diabetes insipidus; 
- serotonin syndrome; 
- drug interaction; 
- glucose dysregulation in patients < 18 years of age. 
• 
Risk Management Plan 
The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring 
additional risk minimization activities have been identified. 
Discussion on Clinical aspects 
To  support  the  application,  1  bioequivalence  study  with  10  mg  of  olanzapine  was  submitted  (No 
60679). The study was designed according to a randomised, open-label, single-dose, three-way, two-
period, two-sequence crossover scheme.  
Of  the  30  subjects  enrolled  26  received  the  two  treatments  and  were  included  in  the  statistical 
analysis. Four subjects were withdrawn from the study either for personal reasons or due to adverse 
events (please see below). The number of subjects included in the study was sufficient. 
14/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  under  appropriate  conditions  and  in  line  with  applicable 
guidelines. 
The  results  of  the  bioequivalence  study  showed  that  the  conventional  confidence  intervals  for  ln-
transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax for olanzapine were within the acceptance range of 80-125%. 
No significant difference in Tmax was evidenced by the non-parametric test. Therefore, based on the 
available data it was concluded that bioequivalence of the two products had been demonstrated. 
The extrapolation of the bioequivalence study results obtained for the 10 mg olanzapine tablets to the 
5  mg,  7.5  mg,  15  mg  and  20  mg  tablets  was  deemed  acceptable  following  the  results  of  additional 
dissolution  studies  demonstrating  similar  dissolution  profiles  of  all  tested  strengths  (please  see 
above).  Consequently,  all  criteria  for  a  biowaiver  listed  in  the applicable guidance were considered 
fulfilled. 
A  number  of  post-dose  adverse  events  were  reported  in  the  safety  population.  Two  subjects  were 
withdrawn from the study due to adverse events, i.e. one subject due to syncope and decreased blood 
pressure, the other one due to vomiting. These adverse events were judged to be possibly related to 
study  medication  and  resolved  spontaneously.  The  safety  concerns  with  the  use  of  olanzapine  have 
been  addressed  in  the  SmPC  with  the  inclusion  of  appropriate  warnings,  precautions,  and 
contraindications, and are in line with the reference product. Moreover, the applicant has committed 
to  monitoring  and  reviewing  in  the  PSURs  the  safety  concerns  observed  also  for  the  reference 
product.

2.6  Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
This  application  is  made  in  accordance  with  Art  3(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  “A  generic 
medicinal  product  of  a  reference  medicinal  product  authorised  by  the  Community”  and  Art  10(1) 
“generic  application”  and  Art  10(3)  “hybrid  application”  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  reference 
medicinal product is Zyprexa. According to the legal basis no non-clinical studies were required. The 
applicant provided an appropriate non-clinical overview of olanzapine based on scientific literature. 
Moreover, no additional clinical trials were required except for bioequivalence studies. The clinical 
overview  provided  an  adequate  summary  of  clinical  data  for  olanzapine.  The  results  of  the 
bioequivalence study demonstrated the bioequivalence of Olazax Disperzi 10 mg orodispersible tablet 
and  the  reference  product,  Zyprexa  10  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  Zyprexa  Velotab  10  mg 
orodispersible tablet. The extrapolation of the study results to other strengths of olanzapine, i.e. 5 mg, 
7.5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg was considered acceptable. The adverse events in the bioequivalence study 
were comparable to the reference product and no serious adverse events were observed. 
The application contained adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has 
been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the originator was therefore concluded.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference medicinal product, was of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities were 
required beyond those included in the product information.

Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of 
Olazax  Disperzi  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg  and  20  mg  orodispersible  tablets  in  the  following 
indications in adults: 
- treatment of schizophrenia; olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during 
continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response;  
- treatment of moderate to severe manic episode; in patients whose manic episode has responded to 
olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar 
disorder;  
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
CAMCEVI 42 mg prolonged-release suspension for injection 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each pre-filled syringe with prolonged-release suspension for injection contains leuprorelin 
mesilate equivalent to 42 mg leuprorelin. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Prolonged-release suspension for injection.  
Pre-filled syringe with off-white to pale yellow viscous and opalescent suspension. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CAMCEVI is indicated for the treatment of hormone dependent advanced prostate cancer and 
for the treatment of high-risk localised and locally advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer 
in combination with radiotherapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adult prostate cancer patients 
CAMCEVI should be administered under the direction of a healthcare professional having 
available the appropriate expertise for monitoring the response to treatment. 
CAMCEVI 42 mg is administered as a single subcutaneous injection every six months. The 
injected suspension forms a solid medicinal product delivery depot and provides continuous 
release of leuprorelin over a six-month period. 
As a rule, therapy of advanced prostate cancer with leuprorelin entails long-term treatment and 
therapy should not be discontinued when remission or improvement occurs. 
Leuprorelin may be used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in combination with radiotherapy 
in high-risk localised and locally advanced prostate cancer. 
Response to leuprorelin should be monitored by clinical parameters and by measuring prostate 
specific antigen (PSA) serum levels. Clinical studies have shown that testosterone levels 
increased during the first 3 days of treatment in the majority of non-orchiectomised patients and 
then decreased to below medical castration levels within 3 to 4 weeks. Once attained, castrate 
levels were maintained as long as leuprorelin therapy continued (<1% testosterone 
breakthroughs). In case the patient’s response appears to be sub-optimal, it should be confirmed 
that serum testosterone levels have reached or are remaining at castrate levels. 
In patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer not surgically castrated receiving 
a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, such as leuprorelin, and eligible for 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment with androgen biosynthesis inhibitors or androgen receptor inhibitors, treatment with 
a GnRH agonist may be continued. 
Special populations 
Renal/hepatic impairment 
No clinical studies were performed in patients having either renal or hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of leuprorelin in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established 
(see also section 4.3). No data are available. 
Method of administration 
CAMCEVI should be administered subcutaneously only by healthcare professionals who are 
familiar with these procedures. For instructions on administration of the medicinal product, see 
section 6.6.  
Intra-arterial or intravenous injection, respectively, has to be strictly avoided. 
As with other medicinal products administered by subcutaneous injection, the injection site 
should be varied periodically. 
4.3  Contraindications 
CAMCEVI is contraindicated in women and paediatric patients. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other GnRH agonists or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Patients who previously underwent orchiectomy (as with other GnRH agonists, leuprorelin does 
not result in further decrease of serum testosterone in case of surgical castration). 
As sole treatment in prostate cancer patients with spinal cord compression or evidence of spinal 
metastases (see also section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval 
In patients with a history of or risk factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving 
concomitant medicinal products that might prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5) physicians 
should assess the benefit/risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to 
initiating leuprorelin. Periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be 
considered.  
Cardiovascular diseases 
Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been 
reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the 
reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors 
when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving GnRH 
agonists should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of 
cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transient testosterone flare 
Leuprorelin, like other GnRH agonists, causes a transient increase in serum concentrations of 
testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and acid phosphatase during the first week of treatment. 
Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new symptoms, including bone 
pain, neuropathy, haematuria, or ureteral or bladder outlet obstruction (see section 4.8). These 
symptoms usually subside on continuation of therapy. 
Additional administration of an appropriate antiandrogen should be considered beginning 3 days 
prior to leuprorelin therapy and continuing for the first two to three weeks of treatment. This has 
been reported to prevent the sequelae of an initial rise in serum testosterone. 
Following surgical castration, leuprorelin does not lead to a further decrease in serum 
testosterone levels in male patients. 
Bone density 
Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had 
orchiectomy or who have been treated with GnRH agonists (see section 4.8). 
Antiandrogen therapy significantly increases the risk for fractures owing to osteoporosis. Only 
limited data is available on this issue. Fractures owing to osteoporosis were observed in 5% of 
patients following 22 months of pharmacological androgen deprivation therapy and in 4% of 
patients following 5 to 10 years of treatment. The risk for fractures owing to osteoporosis is 
generally higher than the risk for pathological fractures. 
Apart from long lasting testosterone deficiency, increased age, smoking and consumption of 
alcoholic beverages, obesity and insufficient exercise may have an influence on the 
development of osteoporosis. 
Pituitary apoplexy 
During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome 
secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of 
GnRH agonists, with a majority occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the 
first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy was presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual 
changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. 
Immediate medical attention is required. 
Hyperglycemia and diabetes 
Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men 
receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or 
worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Blood glucose and/or glycosylated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) should be monitored periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist 
and patients should be managed with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or 
diabetes. 
Convulsions 
Post-marketing reports of convulsions have been observed in patients on leuprorelin with or 
without a history of predisposing factors (see section 4.8). Convulsions are to be managed 
according to the current clinical practice. 
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension:  
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) has been reported in patients 
receiving leuprorelin. Patients should be warned for signs and symptoms of idiopathic 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intracranial hypertension, including severe or recurrent headache, vision disturbances and 
tinnitus. If idiopathic intracranial hypertension occurs, discontinuation of leuprorelin should be 
considered. 
Other events 
Cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression, which may contribute to paralysis 
with or without fatal complications, have been reported with GnRH agonists. If spinal cord 
compression or renal impairment develops, standard treatment of these complications should be 
instituted. 
Patients with vertebral and/or brain metastases as well as patients with urinary tract obstruction 
should be closely monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. There have been no 
reports of any interactions of leuprorelin with other medicinal products. 
Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, the concomitant use of 
leuprorelin with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal products 
able to induce Torsade de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III 
(e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, 
moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc. should be carefully evaluated (see section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
CAMCEVI is contraindicated in women.  
Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprorelin may impair fertility in males 
of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Leuprorelin-containing medicinal products have minor influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. The administration of this medicinal product can cause fatigue, dizziness and visual 
disturbances (see sections 4.8). Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if 
these adverse reactions occur. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions seen with leuprorelin-containing medicinal products are mainly subject to the 
specific pharmacological action of leuprorelin, namely increases and decreases in certain 
hormone levels. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are hot flashes, nausea, malaise 
and fatigue and transient local irritation at the site of injection. Mild or moderate hot flashes 
occur in approximately 58% of patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following undesirable effects were reported during clinical studies with leuprorelin-
containing medicinal products for injection in patients with advanced prostate carcinoma. 
Undesirable effects are classified, by frequency, as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100, 
<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000, <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000, <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000), 
not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Other undesirable effects which have been reported in general to occur with leuprorelin 
treatment include peripheral oedema, pulmonary embolism, palpitations, myalgia, an alteration 
in the skin sensation, muscle weakness, chills, rash, amnesia, and visual disturbances. Muscular 
atrophy has been observed with long-term use of medicinal products in this class. Infarction of 
pre-existing pituitary adenoma has been reported rarely after administration of both short and 
long acting GnRH agonists. There have been rare reports of thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. 
Changes in glucose tolerance have been reported. 
Convulsions have been reported after GnRH agonist analogue administration (see section 4.4). 
Local adverse reactions reported after injection of leuprorelin-containing medicinal products are 
similar to the local adverse reactions associated with similar subcutaneously injected medicinal 
products. Generally, these localised adverse reactions following subcutaneous injection are mild 
and described as being of brief duration. 
Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely after GnRH agonist analogue 
administration. 
Changes in bone density 
Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had 
orchiectomy or who have been treated with a GnRH analogue. It can be anticipated that long 
periods of treatment with leuprorelin may show increasing signs of osteoporosis. Regarding the 
increased risk for fractures owing to osteoporosis (see section 4.4). 
Exacerbation of signs and symptoms of the disease 
Treatment with leuprorelin can cause exacerbations of signs and symptoms of the disease during 
the first few weeks. If conditions such as vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction or 
haematuria are aggravated, neurological problems, such as weakness and/or paraesthesia of the 
lower limbs or worsening of urinary symptoms may occur. 
Clinical experience on local skin tolerability with CAMCEVI 
Local skin tolerability of CAMCEVI was assessed in the main study FP01C-13-001 per four 
aspects: itchiness, erythema, burning, and stinging sensation. Of the 137 subjects receiving 
subcutaneous injections of CAMCEVI, most subjects showed no to mild skin irritation after the 
injection. Generally, the reported localised events were mild to moderate and resolved.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Leuprorelin does not have the potential for abuse, and deliberate overdose is unlikely. There are 
no reports of abuse or overdose having occurred in clinical practice with leuprorelin, but in the 
event that excessive exposure becomes a reality, observation and symptomatic supportive 
treatment are recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Endocrine therapy, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues; 
ATC code: L02AE02 
Mechanism of action 
Leuprorelin mesilate is a synthetic nonapeptide agonist of naturally occurring GnRH that, when 
given continuously, inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion and suppresses testicular 
steroidogenesis in males. This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of medicinal product 
therapy. However, the agonist possesses greater potency than the natural hormone and the time 
to recovery of testosterone levels may vary between patients. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Administration of leuprorelin results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinising 
hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels 
of the gonadal steroids, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males. Continuous 
administration of leuprorelin results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone 
is reduced to below castrate threshold (≤ 50 ng/dL).  
Following the first dose of leuprorelin, mean serum testosterone concentrations transiently increased, 
then fell to below castrate threshold levels (≤ 50 ng/dL) within 3-4 weeks, and were maintained below 
castrate threshold with 6-monthly administration of the medicinal product (Figure 1 below).  
Long-term studies on leuprorelin have shown that continuation of therapy maintains 
testosterone below the castrate level for up to seven years, and presumably indefinitely. 
Tumour size was not measured directly during the clinical trial programme, but there was an 
indirect beneficial tumour response as shown by a 97% reduction in mean PSA for leuprorelin. 
In a phase III randomised clinical study including 970 patients with locally advanced prostate 
cancer (mainly T2c-T4 with some T1c to T2b patients with pathological regional nodal disease) 
of whom 483 were assigned to short-term androgen suppression (6 months) in combination with 
radiation therapy and 487 to long-term therapy (3 years), a non-inferiority analysis compared 
the short-term to long- term concomitant and adjuvant hormonal treatment with GnRH agonist 
(triptorelin or goserelin). The 5-year overall mortality was 19.0% and 15.2%, in the short-term 
and long-term groups, respectively. The observed hazard ratio (HR) of 1.42 with an upper one-
sided 95.71% CI of 1.79 or two-sided 95.71% CI of 1.09; 1.85 (p=0.65 for non-inferiority), 
demonstrate that the combination of radiotherapy plus 6 months of androgen deprivation 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy provides inferior survival as compared with radiotherapy plus 3 years of androgen 
deprivation therapy. Overall survival at 5 years of long-term treatment and short-term treatment 
shows 84.8% and 81.0% survival, respectively. Overall quality of life using QLQ -C30 did not 
differ significantly between the two groups (p=0.37). Results are dominated by the population 
of patients with locally advanced tumours. 
Evidence for the indication of high-risk localised prostate cancer is based on published studies 
of radiotherapy combined with GnRH analogues, including leuprorelin. Clinical data from five 
published studies were analysed (EORTC 22863, RTOG 85-31, RTOG 92-02, RTOG 8610, and 
D’Amico et al., JAMA, 2004), which all demonstrate a benefit for the combination of GnRH 
analogue with radiotherapy. Clear differentiation of the respective study populations for the 
indications locally advanced prostate cancer and high-risk localised prostate cancer was not 
possible in the published studies. 
Clinical data have shown that radiotherapy followed by 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy 
is preferable to radiotherapy followed by 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. 
The recommended duration of androgen deprivation therapy in medical guidelines for T3-T4 
patients receiving radiotherapy is 2-3 years. 
Clinical experience on efficacy with CAMCEVI 
The multicentre, single-arm, open-label, 48-week phase 3 study of leuprorelin included 
137 male patients with high-risk localised and locally advanced prostate cancer in need for 
androgen deprivation therapy. The efficacy of the medicinal product (two doses administered 
24 weeks apart) was evaluated by the percentage of subjects with serum testosterone 
concentrations suppressed to castrate threshold levels, the effect on serum LH levels as measure 
for testosterone level control, and the effect on serum PSA levels. 
The percentage of patients with serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold 
(≤ 50 ng/dL) by day 28 was 98.5% (135 out of 137 patients; intent-to-treat) and 99.2% (123 out 
of 124 subjects; per protocol), respectively (Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Mean serum testosterone concentration over time with CAMCEVI (n=124; per 
protocol population)  
Dotted line indicates the castrate level (50 ng/dL) of serum testosterone. 
9 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Mean serum LH levels were significantly reduced after the first injection, and this effect 
remained until the end of the study (decrease versus baseline by 98% [day 336]). 
Tumour size was not directly measured in this study, but an indirect beneficial tumour response 
can be presumed for leuprorelin as shown by a significant reduction in mean PSA levels over 
time after injection of the medicinal product (mean of 70 ng/mL at baseline decreased to a mean 
minimum of 2.6 ng/mL [per-protocol population] at Day 168. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
the reference medicinal product containing leuprorelin in all subsets of the paediatric population 
in prostate carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following the first and the second doses of leuprorelin, an initial rapid increase of serum 
leuprorelin concentration was observed, followed by a rapid decline over the first 3 days post-
dose: after an initial “burst” phase characterised by mean serum leuprorelin concentrations of 
99.7 and 93.7 ng/mL after approximately 3.7 and 3.8 hours post dosing, respectively, mean 
serum leuprorelin levels maintained relatively constant over each 24-week dosing interval, with 
leuprorelin being continuously released by the third day after dosing with steady serum 
concentrations ("plateau" phase) through the 24-week (approximately 6-month) dosing interval 
(mean concentration: 0.37 to 2.97 ng/mL). There is no indication of significant accumulation 
with repeated leuprorelin dosing at 24-week intervals. 
The initial acute increase of leuprorelin concentrations after CAMCEVI are followed by a rapid 
decline to a steady state levels. 
The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (as per serum testosterone level) profiles of 
leuprorelin versus serum testosterone level observed after initial injection of CAMCEVI (first 
dose) and at 24 weeks (second dose) is shown in Figure 2 (study FP01C-13-001; Part II). 
Figure 2: Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response to CAMCEVI 
Distribution 
The mean steady-state volume of distribution of leuprorelin following intravenous bolus 
administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 litres. In-vitro binding to human plasma 
proteins ranged from 43% to 49%. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolism 
No metabolism study was conducted with leuprorelin. 
Elimination 
In healthy male volunteers, a 1 mg bolus of leuprorelin administered intravenously revealed that 
the mean systemic clearance was 8.34 L/h, with a terminal elimination half- life of 
approximately 3 hours based on a two-compartment model. 
No excretion studies have been conducted with leuprorelin.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical studies with leuprorelin revealed in both sexes effects on the reproductive system, 
which were expected from the known pharmacological properties. These effects were shown to 
be reversible after discontinuation of the treatment and an appropriate period of regeneration. 
Leuprorelin did not show teratogenicity. Embryotoxicity/lethality was observed in rabbits, in 
line with the pharmacological effects of leuprorelin on the reproductive system. 
Consistent with the GnRH agonistic effects of leuprorelin hyperplasia and adenoma were 
observed in the anterior pituitary of rats. 
Carcinogenicity studies were performed in rats and mice over 24 months. In rats, a dose-related 
increase in pituitary apoplexy was observed after subcutaneous administration at doses of 0.6 to 
4 mg/kg/day. No such effect was observed in mice. 
Leuprorelin was not mutagenic in a set of in-vitro and in-vivo assays.

Administer treatment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Remove the grey cap from the syringe (A). 
Twist the clear cap off the bottom of the 
needle (B).  
Attach the needle (B) to the end of the 
syringe (A) by pushing and turning until 
firmly connected. Do not over twist the 
needle and strip the threading to avoid 
possible breakage and drug leakage. 
Discard pre-filled CAMCEVI syringe if 
over-twist causes syringe breakage. 
Choose an injection site on the upper- or 
mid-abdominal area with sufficient soft or 
loose subcutaneous tissue that has not 
recently been used. The injection site 
should be varied periodically. 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol 
swab. Do NOT inject in areas with brawny 
or fibrous subcutaneous tissue or locations 
that can be rubbed or compressed (i.e., with 
a belt or clothing waistband). 
Pull the blue cover off the needle (B). Grab 
and bunch the skin around the injection site 
with one hand. Insert the needle at a 90° 
angle, then release the bunched skin. 
Inject the full contents of the syringe with a 
slow and steady push, then withdraw the 
needle at the same 90° angle used for 
insertion. 
Intra-arterial or intravenous injection have to be strictly 
avoided. 
Step 4 - Discard needle and pre-filled syringe 
Needle Protection 
 
 
 
 
Do not remove the needle from the syringe. Use the 
enclosed Point-Lok device to prevent needle sticks.  
Immediately after use of the needle, gently insert 
the exposed needle into the Point-Lok device 
opening at top of the device. 
Push needle into the top opening until it is firmly 
inserted into the Point-Lok device. This action will 
seal the needle tip and lock the needle firmly into 
the device. 
After use, place the used syringe with needle 
protected in a suitable sharps container.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material 
should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What CAMCEVI is and what it is used for 
The active substance of CAMCEVI is leuprorelin which is a GnRH-agonist (a synthetic version of a 
natural homone called gonadotropin releasing hormone) and acts in the same way as the natural 
hormone to lower the level of the sex hormone testosterone in the body. 
Prostate cancer is sensitive to hormones such as testosterone, and reducing testosterone levels helps 
control the growth of the cancer. 
CAMCEVI is used to treat adult men who have: 
- 
- 
hormone dependent metastatic prostate cancer and 
high-risk non-metastatic hormone dependent prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given CAMCEVI 
DO NOT use CAMCEVI: 
- 
- 
if you are a woman or a child under the age of 18; 
if you are allergic to leuprorelin, or to similar medicines that affect your sex hormones 
(GnRH agonists); your doctor will help you identify these if necessary,   
if you are allergic to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); 
following surgical removal of your testicles. This medicine cannot further help to lower 
your testosterone levels once you have no testicles; 
as the only treatment if you suffer from symptoms related to pressure on the spinal cord or 
a tumour in the spinal column. In this case, CAMCEVI may only be used in combination 
with other medicines for prostate cancer.

Warnings and precautions 
Seek urgent medical attention if you develop: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
sudden headache; 
vomiting; 
loss of, or double vision; 
loss of the ability to move the muscles in, or around, your eye; 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
altered mental state; 
early symptoms of heart failure including 
o 
o 
o 
o 
fatigue 
swelling in your ankles; 
increased need to urinate at night; 
more severe symptoms such as rapid breathing, chest pain, and fainting. 
These may be signs of a condition called pituitary apoplexy, involving bleeding into, or impaired 
blood supply to the pituitary gland found at the base of the brain. Pituitary apoplexy can occur due to a 
tumor of the pituitary and can emerge rarely after starting treatment. Most cases occur within 2 weeks 
of the first dose, and some within the first hour. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using CAMCEVI if you 
- 
develop cardiovascular signs and symptoms such as fast chaotic heartbeats. These rapid 
heartbeats might cause you to faint or have fits (seizures); 
have heart or blood vessel conditions, including heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia), or 
are taking medicines for these conditions. The risk of these heart rhythm problems may 
get worse when using CAMCEVI. Your doctor may monitor your heart using an 
electrocardiogram (ECG); 
have prostate cancer which has spread into your spine or brain. Your doctor will monitor 
you more closely during first few weeks of treatment; 
suffer from diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar levels). CAMCEVI can make existing 
diabetes worse and therefore people with diabetes need more frequent testing of blood 
glucose levels. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse during treatment with CAMCEVI if you 
- 
experience a heart attack. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness and 
sweating; 
suffer from a stroke. Symptoms include your face dropping on one side, not being able to lift 
your arms and slurred speech; 
develop a bone fracture. Treatment with CAMCEVI can increase the risk for fractures due to 
osteoporosis (decrease in bone density); 
have a fit (convulsions); 
notice your blood sugar levels go up. Your doctor will monitor your blood glucose levels during 
treatment; 
have difficulty urinating. There could be a blockage in your urinary tube. Your doctor will 
closely monitor you during the first weeks of treatment; 
develop symptoms of spinal compression such as pain, numbness, or weakness in the arms, 
hands, legs, or feet. Your doctor will closely monitor you during your first few weeks of 
treatment. 
Problems you may experience during the first weeks of treatment 
During the first weeks of treatment, there is generally a brief increase in the male sex hormone 
testosterone in the blood. This can lead to a temporary worsening in disease-related symptoms and 
also to new symptoms that you may not have experienced before. These especially include: 
- 
- 
bone pain; 
problems with urinating, pain, numbness, or weakness in the arms, hands, legs, or feet, or loss 
of bladder or bowel control as a result of spinal compression; 
blood in your urine. 
- 
These symptoms usually lessen with ongoing treatment. If not, you should contact your doctor. 
You may be given another medicine before starting CAMCEVI to help lessen the initial rise of 
testosterone in your blood. You may remain on this other medicine for a few weeks of CAMCEVI 
treatment. 
If CAMCEVI does not help 
Some patients have tumours, that are not sensitive to lower levels of testosterone. Please talk to your 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
doctor if you think that the effect of CAMCEVI is too weak. 
Other medicines and CAMCEVI 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
CAMCEVI might interfere with some medicines used to treat heart rhythm problems (e.g. quinidine, 
procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide) or might increase the risk of heart rhythm 
problems when used with some other medicines, such as methadone (used for pain relief and used as 
heroin substitute when treating drug addicts), moxifloxacin (an antibiotic), and antipsychotic 
medicines used for serious mental illnesses. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is not intended for women. 
Driving and using machines 
Tiredness, dizziness and visual disturbances may occur in people being treated with CAMCEVI. If 
you suffer from any of these side effects, do not drive, use tools or operate machines. 
3. 
How you will be given CAMCEVI 
You will be given CAMCEVI as a single injection under your skin (subcutaneous), 
once every 6 months, by your doctor or nurse. 
This medicine should only be given to you by your doctor or a nurse, who will ensure it is injected 
properly under the skin and not into a vein. 
After injection the medicine becomes solid, and then slowly releases leuprorelin into your body over a 
6-month period. 
In combination with radiotherapy 
This medicine can be used before or at the same time as radiotherapy treatment for high-risk localised 
and locally advanced prostate cancer. High-risk localised means that the cancer is likely to spread 
beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues, becoming locally advanced. Locally advanced means that 
the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis to nearby tissues such as lymph nodes. 
Monitoring your treatment 
Your doctor will monitor your response to treatment with blood tests, including prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA). 
If you receive more CAMCEVI than you should 
Since the injection is given to you by your doctor or appropriately trained staff, an overdose is 
unlikely. If you inadvertently receive too much medicine, your doctor will monitor you and give you 
additional treatment as required. 
If a dose of CAMCEVI is forgotten 
Talk to you doctor if you believe that your six monthly dose of CAMCEVI has been forgotten. 
Effects when treatment with CAMCEVI is stopped 
As a general rule, the therapy for prostate cancer with CAMCEVI requires long-term treatment. 
Therefore, therapy should not be stopped too soon, even if you see your symptoms improve or if they 
disappear completely. If the treatment is stopped too early, your symptoms may return. Do not stop the 
treatment early without talking with your doctor first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3 - Administration procedure: 
Prepare the injection site 
Administer treatment 
 
 
 
 
Choose an injection site on the upper- or 
mid-abdominal area with sufficient soft or 
loose subcutaneous tissue that has not 
recently been used. The injection site 
should be varied periodically. 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol 
swab. Do NOT inject in areas with brawny 
or fibrous subcutaneous tissue or locations 
that can be rubbed or compressed (i.e., with 
a belt or clothing waistband). 
Pull the blue cover off the needle (B). Grab 
and bunch the skin around the injection site 
with one hand. Insert the needle at a 90° 
angle, then release the bunched skin. 
Inject the full contents of the syringe with a 
slow and steady push, then withdraw the 
needle at the same 90° angle used for 
insertion. 
Intra-arterial or intravenous injection have to be 
strictly avoided. 
Step 4 - Discard needle and pre-filled syringe 
Needle Protection 
 
 
 
 
Do not remove the needle from the syringe. Use the

Immediately after use of the needle, gently insert 
the exposed needle into the Point-Lok device 
opening at top of the device. 
Push needle into the top opening until it is firmly 
inserted into the Point-Lok device. This action will 
seal the needle tip and lock the needle firmly into 
the device. 
After use, place the used syringe with needle 
protected in a suitable sharps container.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material 
should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

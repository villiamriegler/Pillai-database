2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, life-threatening, autosomal 
dominant multi-systemic disease caused by mutations in the TTR gene that results in rapidly progressive, 
debilitating morbidity and high mortality.  It has a male predominance (approximately 3:1 male to female 
ratio) with diagnosis typically occurring in the seventh decade. The cardinal manifestations of hATTR 
amyloidosis are polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The estimated European prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis is 0.10 per 10,000 (between 5000 to 6000 
patients), with the majority of cases in Portugal, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom It has a male 
predominance (approximately 3:1 male to female ratio) with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years 
(Swiecicki, Zhen et al. 2015). In Europe, the prevalence is highest in northern Portugal and northern Sweden. 
In northern Sweden is as high as 50 per 100,000 inhabitants. The age of onset of disease varies between 
countries and regions due to differences in the most common mutation types, which is also related to founder 
effects. For example, in Portugal the median age of onset is 30-40 years, whereas it is 50 years in Sweden 
and the applicant refers to a median age of onset of 63 years. The progression rate appears somewhat faster 
in early onset disease. 
The survival after diagnosis is dependent on time from first symptom to diagnosis and also on age of onset. 
The applicant refers to publications claiming a median survival after diagnosis of a mere 4.7 years (range 1.3 
to 24.8 years). Indeed, Swiecicky et al. (2015) show in their single-centre study at the Mayo Clinic that 50% 
of the patients survived 56.8 months. In comparison, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare 
(Socialstyrelsen) states that the survival is 9-13 years from onset. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
TTR, also known as prealbumin, is a tetrameric protein produced by hepatocytes, the choroid plexus and 
retina.  More than 95% of TTR in the circulation is derived from the liver.  The primary physiological role of 
TTR is to serve as a carrier of retinol (also known as vitamin A), which involves TTR binding to the retinol 
binding protein (RBP): vitamin A complex.  Importantly, TTR knockout mice have little to no circulating 
vitamin A or RBP; they have normal RBP levels and vitamin A stores in the liver and exhibit no signs or 
symptoms of vitamin A deficiency provided they have access to dietary vitamin A.  TTR also serves as a 
minor carrier for thyroxine (T4); however, while TTR knockout mice show a 3-fold reduction of T4, 
triiodothyronine (T3) is only modestly affected and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) remains normal.  In 
humans, thyroid binding globulin (TBG) rather than TTR is the main carrier of T4. 
There are more than 120 reported TTR genetic mutations associated with hATTR amyloidosis, and almost all 
patients are heterozygous for the mutated TTR allele.  The most common genotype is the valine to 
methionine mutation at position 30 (V30M), accounting for approximately 50% of cases worldwide, and 
Assessment report

occurring primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden, Japan, and Brazil.(9)  Mutations in the 
TTR gene lead to destabilization of the tetrameric protein and disassociation of the TTR subunits into dimers 
and individual mutant and wt monomers, which subsequently misfold.  These misfolded TTR monomers can 
then self-assemble into oligomers and form amyloid fibrils and plaques in the extracellular space of various 
tissues, including the peripheral nervous system, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, central nervous system 
(CNS) and eye leading to cellular injury and organ dysfunction with corresponding clinical manifestations. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Historically, due to incomplete understanding of etiology and pathogenesis, 2 clinical syndromes of hATTR 
amyloidosis have been described in the medical literature: hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy 
(previously known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, or FAP) and hATTR amyloidosis with 
cardiomyopathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, or FAC), both of which are 
characterized by amyloid deposits comprised of both mutant and wtTTR.  However, while patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis may present with predominantly polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy, most patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis manifest signs and symptoms of both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy over the course of 
their disease.  Therefore, clinicians caring for these patients have evolved to refer to 1 hereditary disease 
with a spectrum of clinical manifestations rather than attempt to classify the disease into 2 distinct 
syndromes.  
The diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis is based on the establishment of characteristic signs and symptoms of 
polyneuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy in conjunction with confirmation of a mutant TTR genotype and 
absence of other known causes of peripheral neuropathy or cardiomyopathy (eg, chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy [CIDP] or immunoglobulin light chain [AL] amyloidosis).  Further support for 
the diagnosis can come from a tissue biopsy (including abdominal fat pad, salivary gland, or rectal biopsy) 
demonstrating amyloid deposits. 
The clinical manifestations of the length-dependent, symmetrical polyneuropathy are the result of amyloid-
mediated injury to large and small peripheral nerve fibers. Sensory abnormalities include painful dysesthesias 
in the feet and hands, as well as loss of sensation leading to thermal burns involving the feet and hands and 
to joint injury in the lower limbs.  Progressive muscle atrophy and motor weakness in both lower and upper 
limbs leads to impaired ambulation and inability to perform other activities of daily living, such as being able 
to hold eating utensils or a drinking glass, or button a shirt or zip up a coat.  Autonomic dysfunction results in 
debilitating orthostatic hypotension, severe gastrointestinal symptoms (including early satiety, chronic 
nausea/vomiting, and both diarrhea and constipation), bladder dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract 
infections, as well as cardiac arrhythmias.   
The rate of neuropathy progression is influenced by TTR genotype, age at symptom onset, and extent of 
neurologic impairment.  Many patients with hATTR amyloidosis are not diagnosed until their neuropathy is 
already at least moderate in severity, with sensorimotor and autonomic abnormalities starting to impact 
ambulation.  In these patients, neuropathy progression is relatively rapid, with data from natural history and 
a placebo-controlled interventional study showing a 10- to 14-point increase (worsening) per year in 
neurologic impairment as measured by the Neurologic Impairment Score (NIS).  This is in contrast to diabetic 
polyneuropathy, where NIS progression is typically less than 1 point per year. 
Cardiac infiltration with amyloid leads to heart wall thickening and cardiomyopathy characterized by heart 
failure due to diastolic and systolic dysfunction, as well as conduction disturbances and arrhythmias.  Patients 
with symptomatic heart failure experience rapid progression of their amyloid cardiomyopathy, with

substantial worsening of echocardiographic and biomarker measures of cardiac function, ambulation, and 
quality of life seen over a period of 18 months or less. 
This constellation of progressive morbidity from amyloid infiltration results in severe disability, and wasting 
due to gastrointestinal malabsorption, malnutrition, and cardiac cachexia.  Death usually results from heart 
failure (including sudden death caused by ventricular arrhythmias or electromechanical dissociation) or 
infection. The median survival is 4.7 years following diagnosis with a reduced survival (3.4 years) for patients 
presenting with cardiomyopathy. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The treatment of hATTR amyloidosis requires a multidisciplinary approach primarily involving neurology, 
gastroenterology, and cardiology specialties.  Limited treatment options, namely orthotopic liver transplant 
(OLT) and TTR tetramer stabilizers, exist for a small subset of patients.  However, availability is limited and 
most patients continuing to experience significant morbidity and mortality associated with disease 
progression.  Palliative/symptomatic therapies directed at specific symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea have been the mainstay of treatment despite their limited effectiveness.   
OLT essentially eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation but does not affect the hepatic production of wt 
TTR, which continues to be made by the transplanted liver.  OLT is only effective in slowing the progression 
of disease in patients with an early age of onset (<50 years of age), especially for those with the V30M 
mutation and short disease duration before transplant.  Consequently, almost two-thirds of patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis are not transplant-eligible.  Even when OLT is possible, morbidity and mortality are 
substantial; patients require life-long immunosuppressive medications, with their attendant risks of infection 
and renal injury.  One-year mortality rates of up to 10% have been reported. 
TTR tetramer stabilizers (including tafamidis and diflunisal) act by binding to the T4-binding site on TTR to 
reduce its dissociation into misfolded amyloidogenic monomers. Tafamidis is not approved in the United 
States.  It received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under exceptional circumstances in 
November 2011 ‘for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with stage I symptomatic 
polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment’. Tafamidis has been reported to be generally well 
tolerated.  Long-term follow-up of the early stage V30M patients who continued tafamidis treatment showed 
continued neuropathy progression over time. Diflunisal, a generic, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that has been demonstrated to bind to and stabilize the TTR tetramer in a manner similar to 
tafamidis, was shown to reduce neuropathy progression compared with placebo in V30M and non-V30M 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with both early and late stage neuropathy in a Phase 3 United States (US) 
National Institutes of Health-sponsored study.  While used off-label in some countries where available, 
diflunisal is not an approved treatment for hATTR amyloidosis in any country. In the United States, diflunisal 
carries boxed warnings for cardiovascular thrombotic events and gastrointestinal risk. Overall, the data to 
date with TTR tetramer stabilizers indicate some slowing of neuropathy progression, with effects limited in 
the case of tafamidis to early stage V30M patients, and no effect on the cardiac manifestations of the 
disease. 
2.2.  About the product 
Patisiran-LNP ranges in size from approximately 60 to 100 nm and contains 4 lipid excipients: DLin-MC3-
DMA; PEG2000-C-DMG; DSPC; and cholesterol. These lipid excipients protect ALN-18328 from degradation 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 14/188 
  
  
by endo- and exo-nucleases in the circulatory system and facilitate delivery to the target site of action, the 
liver. DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG are novel lipid excipients, that are not constituents of any 
approved drugs. DLin-MC3-DMA is important for particle formation, fusogenicity, cellular uptake, and 
endosomal release of the siRNA. PEG2000-C-DMG aids in patisiran-LNP stability in the circulation and 
provides optimum circulation time enabling uptake of patisiran-LNP into the liver. Cholesterol is 
multicompendial (United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary, European Pharmacopoeia, and Japanese 
Pharmacopoeia). DSPC is a synthetic phosphatidylcholine that is very similar to naturally occurring 
phosphatidylcholines, is included in the inactive ingredient (excipient) list by the United States (US) Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for approved products, and is a constituent of 2 drugs that are currently approved 
in the US and the European Union (DaunoXome®[liposomal daunorubicin] and ONIVYDE®[irinotecan 
liposome injection]); these excipients provide physicochemical stability to the LNP. 
ALN-18328, the active ingredient in patisiran-LNP, is a first-in-class siRNA that utilizes the naturally occurring 
mechanism of RNAi to reduce the expression of mutant and wt TTR mRNA and its corresponding protein. 
ALN-18328 is formulated as lipid nanoparticles (patisiran-LNP) to target delivery to hepatocytes in the liver, 
the primary source of TTR protein in the circulation. 
Following intravenous infusion, coating of the LNP (60-100nm in diameter) by apolipoprotein E facilitates 
binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor on hepatocytes and subsequent endocytosis.  Fusion of the 
ionizable lipid component of the LNP with the endosomal membrane then leads to release of the siRNA into 
the cytoplasm where it can bind to and activate the RISC.  The ALN-18328 RNA duplex then unwinds and the 
antisense strand specifically binds to a genetically conserved sequence in the 3’ untranslated region of TTR 
mRNA, and hence can bind both wt and mutant mRNA regardless of the specific pathogenic mutation (Figure 
1).  The Argonaute-2 endonuclease within the RISC/siRNA enzyme complex catalytically degrades wt and 
mutant TTR mRNA, resulting in a reduction of both wt and mutant TTR protein synthesis.

Abbreviations:  dsRNA=double stranded RNA; LNP-lipid nanoparticle; mRNA=messenger RNA; RISC=RNAi induced silencing complex; 
RNAi=RNA interference; siRNA=small interfering ribonucleic acid; TTR=transthyretin. 
Note:  In the naturally occurring process, intracellular double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed by the “Dicer” complex pathway (A) to 
produce siRNAs which become integrated into a multi-subunit protein complex, the RNAi induced silencing complex (RISC) (B), which guides 
the siRNAs to the target mRNA sequence (C).  The siRNA duplex unwinds, and the antisense strand remains bound to RISC and directs 
degradation of the complementary mRNA sequence (D), resulting in target protein suppression (E).  As a therapeutic using this RNAi 
pathway, patisiran delivers a synthetic siRNA specific for TTR mRNA into the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.  Once in the cytoplasm, the siRNA 
bypasses the Dicer complex pathway (A) and interacts with RISC downstream of the Dicer complex pathway (B, C, D) to mediate the specific 
degradation of TTR mRNA (E), thereby reducing the amount of TTR protein. 
Patisiran-LNP mechanism of action is distinct from that of OLT and TTR tetramer stabilizers, and is unique in 
its ability to reduce the levels of both mutant and wt TTR using the catalytic process of RNAi.  The siRNA-
mediated RNAi mechanism of action of patisiran-LNP is also distinct from that of the TTR-targeting ASO 
inotersen, a single-stranded RNA/DNA hybrid that acts on its mRNA target in the nucleus via the RNase H 
endonuclease.   
The therapeutic hypothesis is that the reduction of liver-derived circulating mutant and wt amyloidogenic TTR 
protein by patisiran-LNP will reduce the deposition and promote the stabilization or clearance of TTR amyloid 
deposits, thereby stabilizing (or maybe even improving) the disease manifestations including polyneuropathy 
and cardiomyopathy. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest. This was based on  
•

• 
hATTR is a rare life-threatening genetic disorder, which leads to death within 5-13 years from 
diagnosis.  
There remains a high unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy that can be used by the 
broader hATTR amyloidosis population.  
Patisiran represents a therapeutic innovation with a completely new mechanism of action to treat 
ATTR amyloidosis with RNAi resulting in a suppression of the production of both wild-type and 
mutated TTR protein from the liver. 
From the single pivotal placebo-controlled study, it appears that patisiran was able to stabilise 
disease severity over 18 months. Patisiran had significant effects on neuropathy, nutritional, 
autonomic, and QoL-related endpoints and an acceptable safety profile. 
Alnylam currently holds orphan drug designations for patisiran-LNP in the United States (Number 12 3711) 
and the European Union (EU/3/11/857) for the condition ATTR amyloidosis.  Additionally, in the United 
States, patisiran-LNP was granted Fast Track designation for the “treatment of TTR-Familial Amyloid 
Polyneuropathy” (FDA Ref ID 3398118) and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the treatment of adults 
with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis)” (FDA Ref ID 4182831). 
As a disease that occurs mainly in adults, a pediatric investigational plan waiver was granted by the EMA 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO) for patisiran-LNP as a treatment of FAP (P/0304/2013).  The EMA has 
confirmed that the “treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis” also remains within scope of 
the Decision.  Similarly, patisiran-LNP is exempt from the requirements under the US Paediatric Research 
Equity Act. 
Assessment report

During the development of patisiran-LNP, Alnylam sought scientific advice from the following health 
authorities: United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); European Medicines Agency (EMA); French 
National Agency for Medicine and Health Products Safety (ANSM); Medicine and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency; United Kingdom (MHRA); National Authority of Medicines and Health Products; Portugal 
(INFARMED); Medicinal Products Agency; Sweden (MPA); and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Devices Agency (PMDA). These interactions covered aspects of manufacturing, nonclinical, and clinical 
development, including the pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 004).   
Taking into consideration the rarity of the condition, it was discussed and agreed upon with FDA, EMA, and 
European national health authorities that a single randomized controlled study (Study 004) could serve as 
the basis for the marketing authorization application for patisiran-LNP provided that internal and external 
validity of the study could be demonstrated. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was 
therefore considered appropriate. An active comparator was not used in Study 004, as this was a global trial 
and there is no standard of care worldwide for treatment of the full spectrum of disease severity occurring in 
hATTR amyloidosis.  A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was therefore considered 
appropriate.

General information 
The active substance, patisiran, is a chemically-synthesized, double-stranded oligonucleotide. The sense 
strand and the antisense strand each contain 21 nucleotides. Nineteen nucleotides of the sense strand 
Assessment report

hybridize with the complementary 19 nucleotides of the antisense strand, thus forming 19 nucleotide base 
pairs and leaving the two 3’-terminal nucleotides on each strand as un-hybridized overhangs. 
The chemical names of patisiran sense and antisense strands are: 
•  Sense strand:

The chemical structures and physical properties of patisiran and the single strand intermediates were 
elucidated and confirmed by a combination of LC-MS, MS-MS sequence confirmation, thermal dependent UV 
absorbance, SE-HPLC UV, FAAS, UV absorption, UV spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, Imino-1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 31P-
NMR, FTIR, circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder, hygroscopic, soluble in water and phosphate buffered 
saline.  
With respect to stereochemistry, all the pentose moieties of the nucleotides in the patisiran active substance 
are in the naturally occurring D-ribose form. The ribo phosphoramidite starting materials are 
diastereoisomeric in nature caused by the chiral centre at the phosphorus atom. The diastereoisomeric purity 
of these starting materials is confirmed using two orthogonal methods. The chirality of the D-ribose is 
maintained during the synthesis of the oligonucleotide sequences. Since the ribose moieties in an RNA 
sequence are restricted to C-3’ endo puckering, patisiran molecules adopt the classic A-form. A number of 
isomeric impurities have been observed under stressed degradation and stability studies. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for patisiran.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Patisiran active substance is synthesised in seven main steps, from well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Step 1 Conventional solid-phase synthesis  
Step 2 Cleavage and deprotection  
Step 3 Crude ultrafiltration

The planned commercial process scale for patisiran active substance has been adequately defined. The 
specifications and control methods for starting materials and reagents have been presented. Protected 
phosphoramidites are considered suitable starting materials for synthetic oligonucleotides. Detailed 
information on the impurity profiles of the phosphoramidite starting materials and classification of impurities 
as critical or non-critical has been provided. Critical impurities are those which can be incorporated into the 
product during various steps of synthesis cycle.  Non-critical impurities are those species that cannot be 
incorporated into oligonucleotide during synthesis and thus do not impact the purity of the final product. 
Unspecified phosphoramidite impurities are by default considered critical. The limits of critical impurities have 
been justified and are accepted The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of 
conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DoE) 
studies and models. Using small scale models, a process characterization combining previous manufacturing 
knowledge, multifactorial design of experiment (DoE) and one factor at a time studies (OFAT) were 
conducted to identify potential critical process parameters, parameter set points, and the normal operating 
ranges (NORs) and proven acceptable ranges (PARs). A final risk assessment using scientific rationale, 
process characterization data and manufacturing knowledge was used to assess all process parameters and 
establish a final set of CPPs. 
Based on these studies, proven acceptable ranges have been defined within each of the steps and sub-steps 
of the manufacturing process of the active substance.  The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. Adequate 
in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  in-process  controls,  analytical  methods  and  their 
relationship to the active substance CQAs are defined. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products have been presented. The quality of double-
stranded  oligonucleotides  is  pre-determined  by  the  quality  of  the  single  strand  intermediates,  therefore  the 
control of these intermediates by adequate specifications is critical. For example, some of the impurities can 
only  be  controlled  at  the  level  of  the  single  strand  intermediates.  Identity  by  molecular  weight  and  by 
sequence confirmation is performed for the sense and antisense strand. Consequently, the sequence is of the 
resulting duplex is also proven. The description for the sequencing method is acceptable and the method has 
been  validated  with  respects  to  specificity  which  is  acceptable  for  an  identity  test.  Batches  of  sense  strand 
and  the  antisense  strand  have  been  included  in  the  justification  of  the  specifications.  The  applicant  has 
committed to re-evaluate the specifications for the single strand intermediates specification on the data basis 
of  additional  commercial  batches.  Stability  studies  for  the  single  strands  have  also  been  performed.  No 
degradation  has  been  observed  at  storage  for  6  months  at  2-8°C  and  only  minimal  degradation  has  been 
observed at 25°C/65% RH for three months. 
Holding times are proposed for each step of the active substance synthesis. The applicant provided data 
demonstrating acceptable batch results in relation to these proposed holding times. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Impurities referred to as addition sequences are oligonucleotides that contain at least one additional 
nucleotide. These are referred to as N plus x species (N+x), where N refers to the expected number of 
nucleotides and x refers to the name of additional nucleotides present. The most common impurity in this 
category is the N+1 species. These impurities are primarily formed through detritylation of the incoming 
phosphoramidite during coupling with the acidic activator resulting mainly in a double coupling.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 20/188 
  
  
 
Impurities referred to as deletion sequences are oligonucleotides which are missing one or more nucleotides. 
The internal deletions are referred to as N minus x species (N-x), where N refers to the expected number of 
nucleotides in the full-length oligonucleotide and x refers to the deleted nucleotide. These impurities occur 
due to multiple events, which include incomplete detritylation, incomplete oxidation, and incomplete coupling 
followed by incomplete capping. These impurities contribute a relatively small amount to the overall impurity 
profile. The most common impurity in this group is the N-1 species.  
Impurities referred to as truncated failure sequences, or terminal deletion sequences which are lacking at 
least one terminal nucleotide from either end, are another class of oligonucleotide related impurities. Similar 
to internal deletion sequences, failure sequences are often referred to as N minus x species (N-x), where N 
represents the number of nucleotides in the desired product and x represents the number of nucleotides 
missing from that sequence. These impurities are mainly generated during synthesis when the incoming 
amidite fails to couple and the 5´ hydroxyls of the support bound oligonucleotide intermediate is capped, 
resulting in capped failure sequences. 
The adequacy of the impurity control strategy and suitability of the analytical methods and specifications are 
discussed further under Specifications. Degradation impurities are discussed under Stability. 
Potential genotoxic impurities have been adequately addressed. Some compounds were identified as putative 
mutagenic/carcinogenic impurities. They are depleted during the manufacturing process and it is agreed that 
no further controls are necessary for these impurities. Residual solvents are consistently removed in the drug 
substance manufacturing process and therefore it is acceptable that only the solvent used in the purification 
process  is  tested  at  release  Elemental  impurities  are  tested  in  patisiran  by  a  highly  sensitive  and  selective 
ICP-MS method. All data have been confirmed to meet the acceptance criterion  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes to manufacturers, scale of production and manufacturing process made over 
the course of patisiran active substance development are described. An analytical comparability evaluation on 
chemical, physical and bioanalytical attributes of patisiran active substance was performed to demonstrate 
that patisiran active substance manufactured by the intended commercial manufacturing process and scale is 
analytically comparable to material manufactured by the previous processes and scales used in clinical 
development. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  container  which  complies  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification  includes tests for visual appearance, identification by duplex retention 
time (SE-HPLC UV), identification by molecular mass (IPRP-HPLC MS), identification by Tm(UV 
Spectrophotometry (Thermal)), sodium content (Flame AAS), impurities (SE-HPLC UV and AX-HPLC UV), 
assay (AX-HPLC UV), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), elemental impurities (ICP-MS),  residual 
solvents(GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
There was extensive discussion during the procedure on the adequacy of the impurity test methods to detect 
and quantify individual impurities and the need for orthogonal methods. The stability indicating non-

denaturing SE-HPLC and denaturing AX-HPLC methods were developed and optimized to detect synthesis 
impurities or those that result during chain elongation, as well as potential degradants that may occur 
following exposure to harsh conditions during manufacturing or storage of the active substance. The SE-HPLC 
method utilizes a size based separation mechanism to ensure that the active substance exists predominantly 
in the duplex state. The AX-HPLC method separates the target full length sense and antisense strands from 
synthesis impurities and potential degradants using a charge based separation, primarily determined by 
length of the phosphodiester backbone. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies 
and appropriate specifications have been set. The applicant initially proposed to establish the specification 
limits for active substance based on statistical analysis of release and stability data using a sliding tolerance 
interval (TI) approach. TIs account for uncertainty in estimation to establish bounds that include a specific 
proportion of the data with a specific confidence. They have the undesired property of resulting in intervals 
that are wider the higher the uncertainty is (i.e. the smaller the sample size is). This approach was not 
accepted by the assessors, as due to the limited amount of batch data available, the resulting specification 
limits were in certain instances considerably wider than the observed min-max range. In response, the 
applicant re-evaluated the specifications for duplex purity, sodium content and pH based on ±3SD ranges 
instead of TI approach. The re-evaluated specifications resulted in tightening of the specifications for each of 
the attributes. As more information is gathered using the validated process, the applicant is committed to 
reassessment of the specifications and adjusting, as appropriate based on process capability. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. Batch analysis data at commercial scale of the sense and antisense strands and the final active 
substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 30-48 months under long term conditions (-20°C±5°C) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Data from one supportive development batch stored up to 60 months under long term conditions (-
20°C±5°C) was also provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, impurities (SE-HPLC UV and AX-HPLC UV), assay (AX-
HPLC UV) and water content (KF). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specification limits at long term storage conditions. Degradation 
products increased under accelerated storage conditions; impurity peaks that coincide with expected thermal 
degradants (2’,5’-isomers, shortened sequences) were generated. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on two batches. Following exposure, 
samples were tested for physical appearance, duplex purity by non-denaturing SE-HPLC, assay by denaturing 
AX-HPLC and purity by denaturing AX-HPLC. The direct exposure sample and its respective dark control met 
all acceptance criteria following exposure to both cool white fluorescent and near UV light demonstrating that 
major photolytic impurities were not formed. 
Results for forced degradation studies at stress conditions were also provided. Patisiran active substance was 
exposed to extremes of thermal, acidic, basic, oxidative, and photolytic stress. The level of degradation was 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 22/188 
  
  
calculated by comparison of the peak area response of the challenge sample to that of a non-stressed control 
sample. In the denaturing AX-HPLC method, the duplex structure denatures into roughly equimolar mixture 
of the sense and antisense strands; the peak area response was calculated as the ratio of the stress sample 
peaks to that of the non-stressed control. The major degradation products of the patisiran substance 
observed in the forced degradation study include products of depurination, depyrimidation, base cleavage 
(nucleobases missing from the 3’ or 5’ end), thymine dimers (only upon extreme photolytic stress), isomers 
(primarily 2’5’- isomers) or strand cleavage. The major thermal degradants obtained during the forced 
thermal degradation study are consistent with those obtained following accelerated storage of the active 
substance. There is little or no occurrence of these degradants at the long-term storage conditions (-
20°C±5°C). 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months stored at -20°C±5°C 
in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 2.0 mg/mL of patisiran 
(present as 2.1 mg/mL patisiran sodium) as active substance.  The active substance is incorporated into lipid 
nanoparticles in a phosphate buffer. The nanoparticles are formed by a mixture of four lipid excipients. 
The full list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in section 2.4.1 of this report. 
Cholesterol, dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate, monobasic anhydrous potassium phosphate, sodium 
chloride and water for injections are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with Ph. Eur standards. DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a known pharmaceutical 
ingredient and its quality controlled to an appropriate in-house specification. DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-
DMG are novel excipients. 
The lipid excipients associate with the siRNA, protect it from immediate degradation in the circulatory system, 
and aid in its delivery to the target site in the liver. The components of the LNP and the quantitative 
proportion of each have been determined based on physicochemical and biological properties, as well as 
stability of the formulation.

Table 2 Lipid excipients in Patisiran finished product 
DLin-MC3-DMA 
The ionisable aminolipid DLin-MC3-DMA confers distinct physicochemical properties that regulate particle 
formation, encapsulation of siRNA, cellular uptake, fusogenicity (ability to fuse with the endosomal 
membrane), and endosomal release of the siRNA. This particular lipid was chosen after extensive studies of 
related cationic lipids. It has been demonstrated that neutral nanoparticles display longer circulation lifetimes 
resulting potentially in broader biodistribution profiles as compared to more highly charged particles that are 
more rapidly cleared from the blood. 
PEG2000-C-DMG 
PEG-lipids stabilize the particle by forming a protective hydrophilic layer that shields the hydrophobic lipid 
particle. Additionally, by shielding the particles’ surface charge, the PEGylated lipid prevents the association 
with serum proteins and resulting rapid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system when the particles are 
administered intravenously. It has been found that modulating the alkyl chain length of the PEG-lipid anchor 
controls the rate of PEG-lipid dissociation from the particle, thereby impacting the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of the encapsulated siRNA. PEG2000-C-DMG was chosen to allow for dissociation of the 
PEG-lipid from the circulating particle over time, revealing a particle without PEG that is taken up by hepatic 
cells, leading to siRNA release.

DSPC 
DSPC is a structural lipid for the LNPs, the incorporation of which optimizes stability and encapsulation. DSPC 
is a naturally occurring phospholipid. The lipid has a phosphotidylcholine head group which is zwitterionic at 
neutral pH. Diastearoylphosphatidylcholine has been used in approved drug products and is listed in the 
current FDA Inactive Ingredient Guide. 
Cholesterol 
Cholesterol is also a structural lipid for the LNPs. It is largely hydrophobic with a polar head group. From a 
functional perspective, its structure is planar and conformational inflexible. Cholesterol has the ability to 
affect permeability of lipid systems into which it is incorporated by filling in the gaps created by imperfect 
packing of other lipid species. It is used in several approved drug products. 
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) 
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 consists of 10 mM sodium/potassium phosphate and 150 mM sodium 
chloride and provides an isotonic, neutral medium for parenteral administration. 
Novel Excipients 
DLin-MC3-DMA  
DLin-MC3-DMA is a cationic lipid. with two long unsaturated (linoleyl, C18:2) chains in the structure, each 
containing four double bonds in the Cis (Z) configuration at the 6 and 9 position. The chemical name of DLin-
MC3-DMA is (6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z)-heptatriaconta-6,9,28,31-tetraen-19-yl-4-(dimethylamino) butanoate. It has a 
molecular formula of C 43H79NO2 corresponding to a relative molecular mass of 642.09 and a structure as 
outlined in Figure 3. It is not a chiral molecule. 
Figure 3 Structure of DLin-MC3-DMA 
It is a colourless to pale yellow liquid, very soluble in organic solvents, sparingly soluble in methanol and 
practically insoluble in water. The molecular structure of DLin-MC3-DMA has been elucidated and confirmed 
by a combination of UV, IR, MS, 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis testing. 
DLin-MC3-DMA is a chemically-synthesized lipid compound manufactured from well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications; 
The process does not involve any use of animal or human derived materials. Sufficiently detailed information 
on the route of synthesis is provided in the dossier.  Critical quality attributes and critical process parameters 
have been defined and the in-process controls applied are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
The information provided on potential and actual impurities in DLin-MC3-DMA comprise related substances, 
residuals solvents, peroxides, elemental impurities and genotoxic impurities. Characterization of related 
substances in DLin-MC3-DMA batches has been performed using HPLC-ELSD and samples exposed to stress 
conditions (70°C, 21 days and oxidation by 0.3% H2O2, 3 days) have been used for impurity characterization 
by LC-MS. The susceptibility of DLin-MC3-DMA to oxidative degradation was confirmed during stress 
experiments. Lipid oxidation and isomerization impurity structures are assigned based on known literature

precedent and are expected to be mixtures of isomers. Additionally, DLin-MC3-DMA was shown to be 
susceptible to photolytic degradation. To control the formation of oxidative or photolytic impurities, the 
excipient is stored at sub-ambient temperature, under an inert cover gas, and under protection from light. 
Residual solvents and inorganic impurities (including elemental impurities) are adequately characterised and 
controlled. 
Evaluation of potential genotoxic impurities in the synthesis of DLin-MC3-DMA was performed in accordance 
with the principles stipulated in the ICH M7 guideline. An assessment concluded that the likelihood of the 
presence of the potential impurities containing structural alerts in DLin-MC3-DMA is low because there are 
multiple purification steps downstream from formation or use of these compounds. The control strategy 
proposed has been justified. 
The excipient specification includes tests for visual appearance, identification (HPLC-UC, IR, 1H-NMR,13C-
NMR) related substances (HPLC-ELSD, HPLC-CAD), assay (HPLC-UV), solubility, water content (KF), peroxide 
(FOX assay), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (USP), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The applicant has committed to validate the accuracy of the 
HPLC-ELSD test procedure in accordance guideline ICHQ2 for the known impurity. Satisfactory information 
regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Specification  limits  have  been  based  on  pharmacopoeia  requirements  and  statistical  evaluation  of  the 
available  batch  results.  The  presented  test  results  for  assay,  known  impurities,  unknown  impurities,  total 
impurities,  water  content,  and  peroxides  from  clinical  and  PPQ  batches  are  consistently  lower  than  the 
proposed  specification  limits.  The  proposed  specification  limits  are  accepted  however  the  applicant  has 
committed  to  reassessment  of  the  specifications  once  data  has  been  collected  on  lots  of  excipient  post 
process  qualification.    All  specifications  will  be  assessed  and  any  modifications  will  be  based  on  the 
assessment of process capability, assay performance, and stability. 
The container closure system adequately described.  
Stability data from production scale batches of excipient from the proposed manufacturer stored in packaging 
representative for marketing for up to 12-60 months under long term conditions (-20°C±5°C) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (5°C±3°C) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
During development, the stability of DLin-MC3-DMA has been assessed using analytical methods that 
evaluate quality, purity, and content. These analytical methods have been modified over time, as product 
development progressed. Prior to testing of the latest three PPQ batches, the stability protocol was updated 
to include a more comprehensive summary of specified impurities and their corresponding limits. In order to 
ensure that the first three stability batches were of comparable quality with respect to key quality attributes, 
an analytical evaluation was performed by re-testing the first three batches using the updated analytical 
methodology at 78, 78, and 64 months. 
Photostability testing was performed on the excipient in accordance with ICH Guideline Q1B. Significant 
degradation occurred. Both known and unknown impurities increased . Storage of the excipient at a sub-
ambient temperature, under an inert cover gas, and protection from light is expected to limit oxidative and 
photolytic degradation of this excipient. 
Results for forced degradation studies at stress conditions were also provided. The excipient was exposed to 
thermal, humidity, acidic, alkaline and oxidative stress. At all conditions except for oxidative conditions little

or small increase in impurities occurred As expected at oxidative conditions an increase in some impurities 
occurred. The assay result decreased correspondingly. 
All tested parameters were within the specification limits at long term storage conditions. The stability results 
indicate that the excipient manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results 
justify the proposed retest period of 48 months stored at -20°C±5°C in the proposed container. 
PEG 2000-C-DMG  
The chemical name of PEG 2000-C-DMG is (α-(3’-{[1,2-di(myristyloxy)proponoxyy]carbonylamino}propyl)-ω-
methoxy, polyoxyethylene). It has a molecular formula of (C2 H4O)nC36H73NO5 (n: about 47) corresponding 
to a relative molecular mass of 2650 ± 300 Da and a structure as outlined in Figure 4.  
Figure 4 Structure of PEG2000-C-DMG 
It is a white to off white powder, very soluble in water, chloroform and acetonitrile. The molecular structure 
of PEG2000-C-DMG has been elucidated and confirmed by a combination of orthogonal methods.  
PEG2000-C-DMG is a chemically-synthesized lipid compound manufactured from well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. The process does not involve any use of animal or human derived 
materials. Sufficiently detailed information on the route of synthesis is provided in the dossier. Critical quality 
attributes and critical process parameters have been defined and the in-process controls applied are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
The information provided on potential and actual impurities in PEG 2000-C-DMG comprise process- and 
product-derived organic impurities, residuals solvents, inorganic impurities (including elemental impurities) 
and genotoxic impurities is sufficiently well detailed. The origin and fate of impurities has been adequately 
characterised and an appropriate control strategy has been developed. Residual solvents and inorganic 
impurities (including elemental impurities) are adequately characterised and controlled. 
Evaluation of potential genotoxic impurities in the synthesis of PEG 2000-C-DMG was performed in accordance 
with the principles stipulated in the ICH M7 guideline. The absence of a test for the impurities has been 
justified in line with Option 4 in ICH M7. 
The excipient specification includes tests for visual appearance, identification (1H-NMR), purity and related 
substances (TLC), average molecular weight (MALDI-TOF-MS), free NHS content (1H-NMR), organic volatile 
impurities (GC), water content (KF), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  The specification limits have been justified based 
on pharmacopoeia requirements and available batch results. 
The container closure system including the material of construction was specifically developed for PEG2000-C-
DMG and its quality is controlled in line with relevant guidelines.  
Stability data from production scale batches of excipient from the proposed manufacturer stored in packaging 
representative for marketing for up to 36-60 months under long term conditions (-20°C±5°C) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (25°C 60%RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.During

development, the stability of PEG 2000-C-DMG has been assessed using stability indicating analytical methods. 
Photostability studies have not been performed on PEG2000-C-DMG. The material upon manufacture is always 
stored away from light and is explicitly stated on the certificate of analysis "protect from light”. Therefore, 
absence of a specific photostability study was deemed acceptable. All tested parameters were within the 
specification limits at long term storage conditions and no trends were seen. The stability results indicate that 
the excipient manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the 
proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
Formulation Development  
The therapeutic hypothesis of patisiran finished product is that a small interfering RNA (siRNA; patisiran 
active substance) targeting transthyretin (TTR) formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and administered via 
intravenous (IV) infusion will enable delivery of the siRNA to the liver, result in RNA interference-mediated 
reduction in TTR protein and thereby prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils that form the basis of the 
pathophysiology of hereditary TTR-mediate amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis). In order to achieve its 
therapeutic effect, synthetic siRNAs must be delivered into the cells of the target tissue. 
A comprehensive description of the pharmaceutical development of the finished product formulation has been 
provided. The focus of the development was to enable delivery of the RNA containing lipid nanoparticles 
(LNPs) to the liver cells, allowing the RNA interference-mediated reduction in TTR protein.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DoE) studies and models. Using small scale 
models, a process characterization combining previous manufacturing knowledge, multifactorial design of 
experiment (DoE) and one factor at a time studies (OFAT) were conducted to identify potential critical 
process parameters, parameter set points, and the normal operating ranges (NORs) and proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs). A final risk assessment using scientific rationale, process characterization data and 
manufacturing knowledge was used to assess all process parameters and establish a final set of CPPs. 
The LNP is formed by mixing between an aqueous solution containing the siRNA (patisiran active substance) 
and an ethanol solution containing the 4 lipids. A systematic evaluation of variations of these lipid 
components was used to develop the LNP formulation used for the finished product. Upon optimisation of the 
final formulation a model siRNA able to silence the expression of a particular protein expressed in 
hepatocytes was used. An iterative approach was used that simultaneously examined the effects of using 
different ionisable lipids and the relative molar ratios of the four lipids. The efficacy of the formulation with 
patisiran active substance was verified in animal models prior to initiation of Phase 1 clinical studies. 
Although not a liposome, the physicochemical attributes described in the draft FDA Guidance for Industry: 
Liposome Drug Products (October 2015) was referenced when characterizing the physicochemical attributes 
of the LNP in the patisiran finished product. The finished product has the following physicochemical 
properties. 
Morphology 
Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images of the product confirm that the product consists of 
particles. In addition, the images show that the patisiran DP particles do not have the typical bilayer structure 
of standard liposomes but are spherical nanoparticles with a high electron density core.  
Net charge 
Electrokinetic potential experiments have shown the range of zeta potential values that patisiran DP has at 
pH 7.4. A neutral charged nanoparticle is important as a charged particle will have safety issues when 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 28/188 
  
  
infused. The neutral nature at biologically relevant pH (~7.4) enables adequate distribution within the 
circulatory system without significant degradation. Once out of biologically relevant pH and in the endosomes 
of the liver where the pH is acidic (~5), the LNP is broken down and the active substance is released 
following disruption of endosomal membrane. 
Particle size 
The finished product particle size impacts the pharmacokinetic parameters. Therefore, it is controlled during 
manufacture through the LNP formation process. Based on experience with previous LNP formulations, the 
finished product particle size was chosen to enable delivery primarily to the liver.  
The formulation of the LNPs in phosphate-buffered saline and the primary container-closure system remained 
unchanged throughout all non-clinical and clinical studies of patisiran finished product, and is the same for 
the intended commercial finished product. The finished product commercial manufacturing process is a scale 
up of the manufacturing process used for the initial clinical studies. Key changes are increase of the scale and 
changes to the buffer used to dissolve the active substance. The CPP, non-CPPs, in-process controls are 
justified in relation to CQAs and risk assessment. Detailed information on the development on the 
nanoparticle formation step is provided. 
The choice of sterile filtration and aseptic processing and filling for patisiran finished product has been 
justified by the applicant.  
An in vitro TTR mRNA suppression assay was developed for characterization of finished product activity using 
the Hep3B human hepatoma cell line. The results from finished product batches demonstrated suppression of 
TTR mRNA expression by >95%. Cells treated with control articles exhibited no suppression of TTR mRNA 
levels.  
Comparability data to demonstrate similar delivery and release of the siRNA to the hepatocytes for the 
different size batches tested includes an in vitro functional bioassay, in vitro release assay, and TTR reduction 
in hATTR amyloidosis patients in the Phase 3 studies. The limited data submitted with regards to in vitro 
release of the active substance and bioassay does not indicate any substantial differences in quality between 
the batches. The similarity of product manufactured with the development and commercial scale processes 
cannot be fully evaluated on quality data alone, due to lack on data from the smaller batch size. The 
similarity of these batches is concluded based on the combined pharmaceutical, pre-clinical, clinical and 
pharmacokinetic data. This is discussed further in the clinical part of the assessment report. 
Compatibility of the finished product mixed with 0.9 % NaCl solution in two concentration levels using four 
different application configurations with different materials of construction (DEHP free PVC, or non-PVC 
infusion components) has been demonstrated for up to 19 hours in the infusion bag, and during an 
approximate 5 hour infusion time period at 30°C. No data generated at the preferred storage temperature of 
5°C has been provided however, based on the storage conditions for the unopened vials it can be concluded 
that also the diluted product can be stored at 2-8°C.  
The primary packaging is a Type I glass vial with a Flurotec®-coated chlorobutyl stopper and an aluminium 
flip-off cap as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. 
Extractables  and  leachables  have  been  studied  in  sufficient  detail.  Details  of  the  sterilisation  processes  for 
primary packaging components are described in sufficient detail. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.   
During development the appearance of a white coating on the inner surface of the glass vial at or near the 
liquid-headspace interface was observed. A root-cause analysis indicated that formation of aggregates

EMA/554262/2018 
Page 29/188 
  
  
following shipping is an inherent property of the LNP as a reaction to mechanical stress. In the SmPC the user 
is instructed to withdraw the product with a filter needle to eliminate any aggregates, and to not shake or 
vortex the finished product vials but to gently invert the infusion bag after adding the solution to avoid 
detrimental mechanical stress for the product. The filtration step prior to administration effectively removes 
any aggregates so the presence of the coating does not impact the quality of the product delivered to the 
patient. During the procedure, additional data has been provided by the applicant with regards to the 
morphology and internal structure of the lipid nanoparticles and uniformity of composition across the particle 
size range. The proposed particle size distribution and free siRNA specification limits have been justified from 
a pharmacokinetic perspective. It has been shown that there is no change in these other quality attributes in 
the presence of the white coating or following the remedial pre-administration preparation steps proposed in 
the SmPC. 
The impact of the white coating is under confirmatory evaluation using finished product vials subjected to 
extensive shipping via a transportation study to induce the formation of the white coating under realistic 
conditions of use, and stored as per the stability protocol at long term (2-8°C) and accelerated (25°C/60% 
RH) conditions. To date 6 months of stability data on product in which the white coating is present in varying 
intensities have been provided. The results obtained to date, both at the recommended and accelerated 
conditions, are consistent with samples that do not display a white coating as well as with a prior study in 
which 15 months of data were collected. The applicant has committed to continue the stability study to test 
the impact of the white coating on the finished product quality with commercial scale batch to 36 months of 
storage at 2-8°C. Out of specification results and obvious trends not in accordance with drug product without 
the white coating should be immediately communicated to the agency.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
During  the  procedure  a  major  objection  was  raised  relating  to  missing  confirmation  of  GMP  compliance  for 
one of the manufacturing sites. A GMP inspection of the site was completed by Dutch (NL) inspectorate on 17 
May 2018 with no major or critical deficiencies cited. Confirmation of GMP compliance was confirmed and the 
major objection was resolved. 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of five main steps as outlined below: 
1.  Preparation of active substance and lipid solutions 
2.  Mixing of solutions to form lipid nanoparticles (LNP)  
3.  Ultrafiltration, exchange of buffer and initial concentration  
4.  Dilution to final concentration and bioburden filtration  
5.  Sterile filtration and filling into vials 
Proven acceptable ranges have been defined within each of the steps and sub-steps of the manufacturing 
process of the finished product.  The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch 
analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. The in-process controls applied 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  The in-process controls, 
analytical methods and their relationship to the finished product CQAs are defined. 
Holding times are proposed for each step of the finished product manufacture. The applicant provided data 
demonstrating acceptable batch data and media fill data in relation to these proposed holding times. During 
the procedure a major objection was raised on the absence of bioburden testing directly before the final 
Assessment report

Page 30/188 
  
  
filtration and filling operation The issue was resolved by the applicant agreeing to apply a bioburden test 
immediately prior to the final filtration and filling operation 
The  major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  (4  full  scale 
process  performance  qualification  (PPQ)  batches  of  bulk  drug  product  and  3  full  scale  PPQ  batches  of  final 
patisiran finished product filled in vials). It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage 
form;  visual  appearance,  identification  by  molecular  mass  (IPRP-HPLC  MS),  identification  by  single  strand 
retention time (AX-HPLC UV), purity and impurities (IPRP-HPLC UV and AX-HPLC UV), assay (AX-HPLC  UV), 
lipid  identity  (RP-HPLC  ELSD),  lipid  content  (RP-HPLC  ELSD),  duplex  (siRNA)  encapsulation  (fluorometric 
assay),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  osmolality  (Ph.  Eur.),  particle  size  (DLS),  elemental  impurities  (ICP-MS),    residual 
ethanol  (GC),  residual  EDTA  (IPRP-HPLC  UV),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.)  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.  Eur.), 
sterility  (Ph.  Eur.),  content  uniformity  (Ph.  Eur.),  volume  in  container  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  container  closure 
integrity (dye ingress) and siRNA in vitro  release (kinetic fluorometric assay). The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
As for the active substance, there was extensive discussion during the procedure on the adequacy of the 
impurity test methods to detect and quantify individual impurities in the finished product and the need for 
orthogonal methods. The specification limits were set following the same rationale as the active substance. 
The use of the tolerance interval (TI) approach to setting specifications was not accepted by the CHMP, as 
due to the limited amount of batch data available, the resulting specification limits were in certain instances 
considerably wider than the observed min-max range. The applicant was asked to propose specifications for 
the active substance based on ±3SD ranges or smaller. In response, the applicant re-evaluated the 
specifications for lipid excipient content, particle size, pH, encapsulation, purity and impurities were evaluated 
against historical process performance and against a shelf life of 24-months based on ±3SD ranges and max-
min values instead of TI approach. The re-evaluated specifications resulted in tightening of the specifications 
for some of the attributes. Based on the results of the evaluation, it may be appropriate to tighten the lipid 
release specifications beyond their current ± 3 SD ranges following the review however, at present, a 
sufficient number of data points for the validated larger scale process is not available that would justify 
tightening of the specifications beyond the ± 3 SD ranges. The historical process performance during the 
production of clinical lots supports the adequacy of the originally proposed specifications. 
A test for in vitro release of patisiran from the nanoparticles (by kinetic fluorometric assay) has been included 
in the finished product specification. The test and release limits are considered acceptable as the limits are 
based on results from clinical batches. In general, the validation of the current analytical method is accepted, 
however the acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, which were related to the specification limits, 
need to be justified. The applicant has committed to validate a scaled-up method for the siRNA in-vitro 
release (kinetic fluorometric assay).  The validated method along with the adequate dataset, will be 
submitted in a variation to the EMA, with a target completion by March 2019. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. Batch analysis results are provided for several batches manufactured at different scales 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 31/188 
  
  
The applicant has committed to continual assessment of manufacturing process capability and the 
appropriateness of the specifications with respect to process performance. The reassessment is planned once 
30 lots of the finished product have been produced using the validated process (approximate timeline from 
process validation = 2 years). 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(2-8ºC)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing, 
were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing,  and  stored  in  upright  and  inverted 
orientations.  
Samples were tested for appearance, purity of active substance (duplex and single strands), assay, lipid 
content, siRNA encapsulation, pH, osmolality, particle size, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxins, sterility 
and container integrity (dye ingress). All results meet the proposed commercial specifications throughout the 
36 months of data collection.  
Photostability testing has been performed on two batches of finished product in accordance with ICH 
Guideline Q1B. The direct exposure sample and its respective dark control met all acceptance criteria 
following exposure to the light at 1 x ICH Q1B exposure equivalent. Accordingly, no special protection from 
light is required during storage of the patisiran finished product. Exposure of the patisiran finished product to 
a 4 x ICH Q1B exposure equivalent resulted in a decrease in the content of the unsaturated lipid DLin- MC3-
DMA and a concomitant increase in its likely oxidation products. Photostability studies performed on DLin-
MC3-DMA independently of the patisiran finished product indicated sensitivity of the unsaturated lipid to 
photolytic degradation. However, the rate and extent of degradation is substantially less in the formulated 
patisiran finished product than in the neat lipid. 
Results for forced degradation studies at stress conditions were also provided. The finished product was 
exposed to heat), acid stress basic stress and oxidative stress. There were varying levels of degradation of 
active substance and lipid components under all stress conditions. Under all stressed conditions on the 
encapsulated finished product, reduction in duplex purity was observed). In contrast, the duplex purity for 
non-encapsulated patisiran active substance was shown to undergo significant reduction under less severe 
conditions. 
An in-use stability study of the chemical and physical stability of the admixture has been assessed under 
simulated conditions of use, and utilizing clinically relevant concentrations of the patisiran finished product 
representing two-fold differences in patient weight (50 and 104 kg) at 30°C±2°C/75%±5% RH and ambient 
fluorescent lighting and following a simulated infusion using clinically relevant equipment, filters, 
administration sets, and supplies. The results of the in-use stability assessment confirm the physical and 
chemical stability of the admixture at clinically relevant concentrations following a 16-hour hold-time in the 
infusion bag (0.9% NaCl) at a customary room temperature (up to ICH climatic Zone IVb), and followed by a 
simulated infusion under ambient lighting. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months when stored at 2-8°C as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
S.4 
1.  The applicant is committed to reassessment of the active substance specifications and adjusting as 
appropriate based on process capability when more batch data is available.

2.  The applicant is committed to continue the new stability study to test the impact of the white coating 
on the drug product quality with the ongoing commercial scale drug product batch to 36 months of 
storage at 2°C-8°C. Out of specification results and obvious trends not in accordance with drug 
product without the white coating should be immediately communicated to the agency.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The drug product (Onpattro) has the form of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that contains the double-stranded 
siRNA (ds-siRNA) patisiran sodium as active pharmaceutical ingredient (patisiran for short, experimental 
name ALN-18328, CAS no: 1386913-72-9; the whole particle is also described as patisiran-LNP). Patisiran 
consists of two RNA single strands (A-32345, the sense strand, and A-32346, the antisense strand) and has 
the chemical formula C412H520N148O290P40 (free acid) alternatively C412H480N148Na40O290P40 (sodium salt) and 
a molecular weight of 13424Da (free acid) alternatively 14304Da (sodium salt). The purpose of the ds-siRNA 
is to inhibit the mRNA expression of human mutant and wild-type transthyretin mRNA (mostly produced in 
the liver) via the RNA interference pathway. Besides the ds-siRNA, there are four excipients (constituting the 
LNP) whereof two are novel ones (see below). 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The ds-siRNA was designed against a target region in the human TTR gene that seems to be 100% conserved 
across different human populations (i.e. no polymorphisms). The ds-siRNA was also effective in-vitro against 
common human transthyretin alleles (including Val30Met, the most common mutation linked to the disease). 
Potential off-target mRNAs similar to TTR mRNA were identified through bioinformatics analysis, but no clear 
in-vitro suppression of their expression was measured when tested. The in-vivo studies show that the ds-
siRNA reduces liver tissue TTR mRNA and serum TTR protein in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. After a single 
patisiran-LNP dose in naïve cynomolgus monkeys, liver TTR mRNA is reduced between 43% (0.03mg/kg) 
and94% (0.3mg/kg). Serum TTR protein levels are reduced between 46% (0.03mg/kg) and 75% 
(0.3mg/kg). For a single dose in cynomolgus monkeys, it takes 4-8d after administration before the greatest 
TTR reduction is seen and at least 24-28d before TTR levels start to approach pre-exposure levels. The extent 
of TTR protein suppression in cynomolgus monkeys (65-91%, 0.15-0.5mg/kg) after repeat dosing seems 
roughly similar between an every 3 week alternatively every 4 week exposure schedule (q3w or q4w) in a 
repeat-dose study spanning 24w +12w recovery. With repeated dosing in cynomolgus monkeys, it takes 9-
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 34/188 
  
  
12w (q3w or q4w) before lowest steady state TTR suppression is reached/observed. After the end of repeated 
dosing (q3w or q4w) over 24w it takes around 12w recovery for TTR protein normalization. In a mouse 
disease model (the V30M/Hsf-1 KO mouse model), the tissue TTR protein suppression is 97-100% after 6 
doses of ALN-TTR01 (LNP with same siRNA as patisiran-LNP) at 3mg/kg (bi-weekly; only one dose was 
tested). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Patisiran-LNP treatment (0.3-3mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys reduced serum TTR protein levels in a manner 
that was correlated with a reduction in TTR protein associated molecule levels (i.e. Retinol binding protein 
(RBP), Vitamin A and T4 – but not T3). After repeated dosing between 0.3mg/kg and 3mg/kg for 4 doses bi-
weekly and 14 doses every three weeks, a max T4 hormone reduction of 46-50% was measured. Vit A was 
reduced starting after 48-168h in cynomolgus monkeys at all tested doses (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) with 42-70% at 
the lowest dose and between 50-79% at the highest dose (increasing reduction with additional doses). 
Overall, the treatment effects on TTR interaction targets tend to occur rapidly (within 2-3w of the first 
dosing) but the recovery to pre-exposure levels is much slower after repeated dosing at higher doses (i.e. 
≤60d for lower doses but >60d at the max dose of 3mg/kg). Treatment impact on cytokine levels have also 
been studied (see toxicology section). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In-vitro hERG testing was not conducted for the ds-siRNA but only for the possible impact from the LNP (with 
patisiran exchanged for an insect luciferase siRNA with no target in the human genome). There was no 
indication that the LNP in itself can inhibit the hERG channel (see Discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Increased body temperature and heart rate were seen in cynomolgus monkeys after a single IV 60min 
infusion dose at ≥3mg/kg (max dose at 6mg/kg), giving a NOEL and NOAEL for patisiran-LNP at 1mg/kg and 
a LOAEL of 3mg/kg (see Discussion on non-clinical aspects). For one animal at 3mg/kg and two animals at 
6mg/kg, the effects remained 39-47h after infusion. No neurological effects were detected.  
Excipients: The LNP component of patisiran-LNP has the overall purpose of supporting the targeting of and 
uptake in liver cells and contains four lipid excipients relevant for its structure and functionality. Among 
those, DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG are novel excipients. The DLin-MC3-DMA is a 0.642kDa lipid and 
the PEG 2000-C-DMG is a 2.5kDa PEGylated lipid. The stated role of the DLin-MC3-DMA lipids is to support 
particle formation, cellular uptake via endocytosis, and endosomal release of the ds-siRNA into the cytosol. 
DLin-MC3-DMA on its own is highly insoluble in aqueous solutions, the lowest detected soluble concentration 
being 3uM (4.3% of 1x Cmax from Clinical Phase I studies). PEG2000-C-DMG is exposed on the surface of 
patisiran-LNP and has the purpose to stabilize the LNP particle by forming a protective hydrophilic layer that 
shields the hydrophobic lipid particle and inhibits association with plasma proteins and cell surfaces. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacodynamic drug interactions. The potential for 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions with patisiran-LNP in humans is expected to be low since there are no 
other TTR suppressive agents or other agents that affect TTR production. This has been considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies for patisiran-LNP characterized the ADME aspects of the ds-siRNA 
and the two novel excipients in the LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG) but not the other two more 
established LNP excipients (cholesterol and DSPC). The siRNA measurements in plasma used LC-MS/MS 
methods while measurements in other tissues (e.g. liver, spleen) used binding-based methods (primarily 
non-validated PNA-probe HPLC methodology). Excipients were measured using LC-MS/MS. 
Plasma kinetics: In Sprague Dawley rat exposed to a single IV bolus dose (0.03, 0.30 or 1.0mg/kg) of 
patisiran-LNP, the systemic plasma levels (Cmax: low dose 0.587-0.595ug/mL to max dose 25.1-
26.65ug/mL; AUC0-t: low dose  0.212-0.294ug x h/mL to max dose 12.7-13.8ug x h/mL) of the ds-siRNA 
were more than dose-proportional primarily between the low and middle dose (12-13x vs external 10x dose 
ratio) and the low and max dose (42x-60x vs external 33x dose ratio). The rat clearance was between 72.3 
and 101mL/kg/h and the t 1/2 0.23-0.44h. In cynomolgus monkeys exposed to a single dose (same doses as 
rat) of patisiran-LNP via 1h infusion, the systemic plasma levels of the siRNA (Cmax: low dose 0.203-
0.258ug/mL to max dose 16.5-18.1ug/mL; AUC0-t: low dose  0.292-0.336ug x h/mL to max dose 19.9-28.8ug 
x h/mL) were also more than dose-proportional between the low and middle dose (12-19x vs external 10x 
dose ratio) and the low and max dose (64x-89x vs external 33x dose ratio). The monkey clearance reduced 
with increasing dose (135-164 to 29.8-49.5mL/kg/h) while the t 1/2 increased with dose (males 3.52 to 14.7h, 
females 10.2 to 19.1h). This dose-related increase in t 1/2 was also observed in toxicological repeated dose 
studies in monkey. 
DLin-MC3-DMA: In Sprague Dawley rat, DLin-MC3-DMA is roughly dose-proportional in rat plasma levels 
compared to the external doses (0.03 to 1.00mg/kg single bolus dose of patisiran-LNP). The differences for 
Cmax (low dose 3.55-3.72ug/mL to max dose 141-151ug/mL) and AUC0-t (low dose 5.97-6.23ug x h/mL to 
max dose 218-227ug x h/mL) between the low and max dose is slightly more than dose-proportional. No 
dose-relation for the clearance is observed but the half-life increases with dose (from low dose 82.3-177h to 
high dose 246-288h). In cynomolgus monkey plasma, DLin-MC3-DMA is more than dose proportional for 
Cmax (low dose 1.82-2.02ug/mL to max dose 122-136ug/mL) and somewhat less than dose-proportional for 
AUC0-t (low dose 50.7-63ug x h/mL to max dose 1551-1850ug x h/mL). There is no change in clearance and 
no consistent dose-dependent increase in t 1/2 (ranging between 428 and 780h).  
PEG2000-C-DMG: Only the max dose (1.0mg/kg) of patisiran-LNP was evaluated for PEG2000-C-DMG plasma 
levels in the single dose rat and cynomolgus monkeys studies. The Cmax was 15.1-16.5ug/mL for rat (bolus 
dose) and 16-8-18.2ug/mL for monkey (1h infusion). For the AUC0-t, rat has 20.6-23.5ug x h/mL whereas 
monkey has 220-225ug x h/mL. Clearance is 36.5mL/kg/h for rat and 3.48-3.49 mL/kg/h for monkey. The 
half-life is much longer for PEG2000-C-DMG in monkey (160-162h) than in rat (21.3h).  Based on the 
publication of Mui & Tam (2013; DOI: 10.1038/mtna.2013.66), PEG2000-C-DMG desorbs from the LNP in 
mouse plasma following IV infusion with an estimated desorption rate of 45% per hour. Within 2 hours after 
IV administration, 80% of PEG2000-C-DMG has desorbed from the LNP.  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against PEG2000-C-DMG were reported in rats and monkey studies, indicating a 
potential decrease of exposure in the 26-week study in rats (measured in toxicology studies). There were 
some issue with some preclinical studies showing pre-dose ADA (in the 6-week rat and 6-week monkey 
toxicology studies) but these measurements are considered unlikely to be relevant. The applicant specified 
that this measure is a false positive due to a nonspecific binding in serum when compared to diluent. This is 
supported by the very limited number of animals having confirmed ADA in the long term GLP studies.

Tissue distribution: Patisiran-LNP had a low binding to rat serum albumin (0.89%), human serum albumin 
(0.46%), and human α1-acid glycoprotein (2.07%). No data were given for the monkeys despite being a 
pharmacologically-relevant species but the applicant has justified this with a pharmacodynamics rational (i.e. 
monkey and human having a similar profile of decrease in serum TTR for the same dose level).  
Based on male adult rat autoradiography (QWBA) studies with 0.3mg/kg single dose IV patisiran-LNP with 
radiolabelled 14C-DLin-MC3-DMA, most of the radioactivity (>90%) is rapidly distributed to the liver (Cmax 
69.5ug equiv/g tissue > ULOQ and tmax 1-3.5h in Sprague Dawley rat; 73.9ug equiv/g tissue > ULOQ and 
tmax 1-6h in Long Evans rat) which is also the main target for organ toxicity (see the toxicology section and 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects). While the clear majority of the ALN-TTR02 dose was found in the liver, 
the highest signal was found in the posterior lymph node (Cmax 176.6-275.7ug equiv/g tissue (> ULOQ) with 
tmax 48-168h). Other weak to moderate uptake organs ranked on estimated uptake of total dose were 
spleen (1.61-1.67% of total dose), kidney (0.14-0.42% of total dose), lungs (0.21-0.57% of total dose), 
heart (0.07-0.24% of total dose) and adrenals (0.03-0.14% of total dose). Additional organs/tissues with a 
weak to moderate uptake are the small intestine, the bone marrow and the prostate (0.90-0.292ug equiv/g) 
(see also Discussion on non-clinical aspects). There was very little uptake in the central nervous system 
tissues (≤0.070ug equiv/g, tmax 0.25-24h) in both rat stocks, corresponding to less than 0.02% of the total 
dose. That being said, there was some initial uptake in the meninges of rats (1.16-4.2ug equiv/g, tmax 0.25-
1h) directly after infusion. No pigmentation-dependent differences were observed. 
Overall, mainly the lipid part of the LNP is taken up and broken down in liver cells, endothelial cells and 
phagocytic cells. Organs/tissues with cells rich in LDL-like and related scavenger receptors and/or where a 
fenestrated endothelium exists are also capable of taking up the LNP (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen, bone 
marrow vessels, and adrenal gland). The rat quantitative QWBA study and repeat-dose toxicity findings are 
consistent with uptake of the LNP in these organs (i.e., spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and adrenal 
gland). 
ds-siRNA liver distribution: While much of the patisiran-LNP is rapidly shifted to the liver (tmax ~1h), the 
initial uptake of patisiran-LNP into hepatocytes is slower as most of the radioactivity signal is found in the 
liver sinusoid lumens. For cynomolgus monkeys, the liver tmax for the ds-siRNA is estimated to 2h. In rat, 
after 24h-72h, the radioactive signal starts to increase in the hepatocyte cell cytoplasm and in cells of the 
hepatic vasculature, becoming roughly equal to vascular lumen signals (unclear if also uptake in Kupffer 
cells) (see also Discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
DLin-MC3-DMA liver distribution: The DLin-MC3-DMA excipient (measured with LC-MS/MS) had a rat liver 
specific tmax between 4 and 24h and a cynomolgus monkeys liver tmax of 5-15h (no clear dose-
dependency). Both liver Cmax and AUC in monkeys increase with increasing dose with a profile indicating 
that the uptake is more than dose proportional (11.1-16x vs external 10x dose ratio) between the low dose 
(0.03mg/kg) and middle dose (0.30mg/kg) and proportional between the middle dose and high dose 
(1.0mg/kg). In rat, it is estimated that 77.7% of the DLin-MC3-DMA in the total patisiran-LNP dose is located 
in the liver (50% left after 7d, 25% left after 14d and 3.14% left after 60d). In monkeys, the liver has >97% 
of the DLin-MC3-DMA of the total patisiran-LNP dose for the first 7d after the dose, 43.2% after 14d and 25% 
after 28d.  
Regarding the impact of DLin-MC3-DMA on the liver, the applicant estimates DLin-MC3-DMA to have unbound 
plasma Cmax of ~3.1uM and a liver Cmax of ~6.7uM. Based on that in-vitro tests used up to 30uM and did 
not detect CYP induction/inhibition effects, the applicant argues that it is unlikely that clinical DLin-MC3-DMA 
concentrations would result in significant clinical inhibition or induction of liver CYP enzymes. Also, for tests 
using up 3uM (e.g. efflux proteins), there is no indication of a trend that would indicate a molecular effect.

PEG2000-C-DMG liver distribution: The PEG2000-C-DMG excipient (measured with LC-MS/MS, and only based 
on one dose: 1mg/kg) had a rat liver specific tmax of ~1h (single bolus dose) and a cynomolgus monkey 
liver tmax of 2h (1h infusion). After 1h, there is 48.9% of the PEG2000-C-DMG from the total patisiran-LNP 
dose in the liver and 10.4% after 24h and 0.81% after 7d. In cynomolgus monkeys liver, 10.5% is left after 
24h and 0.86% after 7d. The PEG2000-C-DMG liver Cmax is 7.27-8.71ug/mL in rat and 1.92-3.4ug/mL in 
cynomolgus monkeys. The AUC0-t is 196-207ug x h/mL in rat and 5.52-6.19ug x h/mL in cynomolgus 
monkeys. The liver t 1/2 is calculated to 207h in male rat (not reported in female rat or cynomolgus monkeys).  
Metabolism: Based on biochemical testing with different species serum samples, the proportion of intact 
siRNA in a patisiran-LNP formulation after 24h was 62-71% in rodents (CD-1 mouse and Sprague-Dawley 
rat), 42-44% in cynomolgus monkeys and ~100% in human. In cynomolgus monkeys liver microsomes from 
patisiran-LNP treated animals (1mg/kg/day 1h IV, biweekly for 4 doses), there were no significant changes in 
the protein levels/activities of CYP1A1/2, CYP2C76, CYP2C43, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 or UGT1A1. For liver cytosol, 
there were some indications (although but not fully replicated) that ALN-18328 was also more stable over 
time in human samples compared to cynomolgus monkey and rat. In contrast, for free siRNA, and supporting 
the functionality of the LNP, there is <1% left intact after 24h in serum or liver+S9 samples independent of 
species. The degradation of the siRNA occurs via exonuclease activity. When measured in rat urine, no intact 
ds-siRNA can be detected within 29d after a single bolus dose.

DLin-MC3-DMA: The in-vitro metabolite profiles of DLin-MC3-DMA were similar based on mouse, rat, monkey, 
and human liver microsomes or S9 incubations. In rat, 6 DLin-MC3-DMA metabolites (mostly various mono 
and di-oxidation metabolites) were identified whereof one, the hydrolysis metabolite M6 (4-
Dimethylaminobutyric acid or DMBA; also detected in humans) was found in all tissues studied (only at <3% 
in plasma). In cynomolgus monkeys 65-68% of the DLin-MC3-DMA radioactivity was based on the parent 
compound. Three metabolites were detected in cynomolgus monkeys;one corresponded to DBMA and was 
found in both plasma (<1% of the total dose) and excretions (mostly in urine but also in faeces). A second 
plasma metabolite, Dioxy-DLin-MC3-DMA, was found in monkey plasma at 2-5%. Overall, in rat and monkey 
plasma, no metabolite was >10% of the total dose of DLin-MC3-DMA.  
PEG2000-C-DMG: Based on mouse, rat, monkey, and human liver microsome or S9 samples, a total of 6 
PEG2000-C-DMG O-detetradecylation metabolites were detected in cynomolgus monkeys and human (but not 
in rodents). None of the PEG2000-C-DMG or its metabolites was detected in rat urine within 29d after a single 
bolus dose.  
Elimination: In both rats and monkeys, patisiran-LNP radioactivity was primarily recovered in the urine 
(~49% in rats and ~50% in cynomolgus monkeys) with some excreted in the faeces (~24% in rats and 
~10% in monkeys). In rats, most of the excreted dose is found in the urine from the first post-dose week 
(~34.5% of the total dose). No intact ds-siRNA was excreted in urine or faeces in rats or monkeys. Intact 
rats showed a urinary DLin-MC3-DMA elimination of ~33% of the total dose. No intact DLin-MC3-DMA was 
found in monkey urine. 
PEG 2000-C-DMG: In cynomolgus monkeys, there was approximately 44% of PEG2000-C-DMG excreted in the 
faeces. PEG2000-C-DMG was not detected in urine. 
Drug interactions:  
In a 6-week monkey toxicity study, following 4 doses of patisiran-LNP by IV infusion (1 mg/kg, q2w x 4), 
there were approximately 97% reductions in liver TTR mRNA concentrations (relative to control), 90% 
reductions in TTR serum protein concentrations (relative to baseline), and no inhibition or induction of hepatic 
CYP1A1/2, CYP2C76, CYP2C43, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 (both midazolam and testosterone as substrate), and 
UGT1A1 was observed. This data suggests that patisiran-mediated reductions in hepatic TTR mRNA and 
serum TTR protein did not impact the activity of several CYP isozymes.  
ALN-18328, PEG2000-C-DMG, or DMBA, the hydrolysis metabolite of DLin-MC3-DMA do not appear to be 
inhibitors or substrates of the transporters OATP1B1 (CHO), OATP1B3 (CHO), OAT1 (CHO), OAT3 (HEK293), 
OCT1 (CHO), OCT2 (CHO), MATE1 (MDCKII), and MATE2-K (MDCKII), at concentrations up to 50X the 
observed Cmax in humans at 0.3 mg/kg (7.15 µg/mL [ALN-18328], 40.2 µg/mL [DLin-MC3-DMA], 4.22 
µg/mL [PEG2000-C-DMG]). 
Taken together, the in vivo and ex vivo data on enzyme inhibition/induction, protein binding and transporter 
interactions on the components of patisiran-LNP (ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA, and PEG2000-C-DMG) suggest 
a low propensity to cause drug interactions with co-medications likely to be administered with patisiran-LNP. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
A comprehensive program of toxicology studies has been performed with patisiran-LNP, which includes 
single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 39/188 
  
  
 
Supplementary studies have been performed to evaluate excipients and immunostimulation. TK monitoring 
has been included in the pivotal studies and some additional studies. All pivotal studies are considered GLP 
compliant. However, it is noted that site in the USA that performed for the phases of analysis of cytokine and 
complement in the pivotal toxicity study on monkeys (TR02-NCD12-001) has never been inspected by US 
FDA to verify its claim of GLP compliance. However, cytokine and complement were not changed when 
measured after single –dose monkey study with ALN-18328 (study TTR-NCD09-004). During the repeated 
studies in monkeys, it was observed that administration of patisiran-LNP or AF-011-1955 resulted in transient 
complement activation (C3a and Bb) shortly after dosing that was not accompanied by any adverse clinical 
signs. Moreover complement activation in monkeys is a known effect following siRNA administration 
(Mustonen et al. 2017). Thus, the analysis performed by the laboratory report expected effects. 
Patisiran is a siRNA directed against human TTR mRNA and has cross-reactivity in the cynomolgus monkeys, 
but not in rat mouse or rabbit. As a consequence, general toxicology studies have been performed in 
cynomolgus  monkeys (pharmacologically active) and rats (off-target). To determine whether any observed 
toxicities were related to the specific siRNA contained in the formulation, nonspecific siRNA effects, or to the 
LNP formulation itself an LNP that contained siRNA directed against insect luciferase mRNA (AD-1955) was 
included in general toxicology studies. To evaluate on-target reproductive and developmental toxicities 
related to siRNA- mediated reduction in serum TTR concentrations (TTR reduction and associated reductions 
in vitamin A and thyroxine) the rodent reproductive and developmental toxicity studies included a rodent 
surrogate siRNA (AD-18534). IV infusion was used in the repeat-dose toxicology studies with in general a 
once every two- or three-week dosing interval to support the clinical route and timing of dose administration.  
Separate toxicology studies were not conducted with the 2 novel lipids, DLin-MC3-DMA, and PEG 2000-CDMG. 
However, the TKs of the lipids were evaluated in almost all general toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies, why it can be argued that the lipids have been evaluated in the studies.  
Due to a change in manufacturing scale, a single-dose intravenous infusion bridging comparability study in 
monkey was performed. Similar PD, PK, and safety were observed following a single IV infusion of patisiran-
LNP produced by either Alnylam or NLI. However, it should also be pointed out that an in vivo study with the 
above described design is not sensitive enough to pick up (safety) issues related to the relatively small 
changes made in the composition. 
The liver is the primary site of patisiran-LNP uptake and accumulation, and hepatotoxicity determined the 
NOAELS in all non-clinical species. Further target organs of toxicity include spleen, bone marrow, lymph 
nodes and adrenal gland, which is also consistent with the uptake of patisiran LNP into sinusoidal organs with 
fenestrated endothelium. Overall, the toxicities seen are not primarily related to the pharmacology of the 
TTR-targeting siRNA but are more likely derived from the LNP. This is supported by the similarities in 
toxicological profile in the general toxicology studies regardless of siRNA target in the LNP (insect luciferase 
or human TTR). 
Single dose toxicity 
A single-dose IV study with the unformulated siRNA in monkeys at 100 mg/kg showed no toxicities even at 
the highest dose. ALN-18328 is not heavily chemically modified for stability, and when unformulated, it is 
rapidly metabolized and cleared from the circulation.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Primary target organs of toxicity for patisiran-LNP were the liver and spleen. Secondary target organs 
included spleen, adrenal glands, testis, lymph nodes and the infusion sites. 
Liver: Hepatocyte single-cell necrosis was a common finding across all general toxicology studies and species 
and ranging from minimal to marked severity. It was noted in rats at ≥0.1 mg/kg/q4w for 4 weeks and 0.15 
mg/kg/q2w for 6 weeks. In monkey the finding was evident at 3 mg/kg/q2w for 6 weeks and at ≥1 
mg/kg/q3w for 39 weeks. The necrosis was partially or fully reversible across studies.  In addition, 
hepatocellular vacuolation (ranging from minimal to marked severity) was present in rats at ≥0.15 
mg/kg/q2w for 6 weeks and at 0.3 mg/kg/q2w for 26 weeks, and monkeys at 3 mg/kg/q2w for 6 weeks and 
at ≥1 mg/kg/q3w for 39 weeks. In all of the species, reversible increased mixed cell inflammation/infiltration 
(of minimal tomarked severity) was observed that was sometimes accompanied by inflammation-related 
changes in hematology. Overall, the liver findings were correlated with changes in liver enzymes and were 
the primary drivers of NOAELs in the studies. 
It is noted that no single cell necrosis or adverse findings are found in the 26-week rat study. However, as 
noted in the toxicokinetics section, systemic exposure to ALN-18328 was not detected at the end of the 
dosing period in any dose group and around 50% of the animals had detectable ADA directed against 
PEG2000-C-DMG. Thus, this study is not considered to fully reflect the toxicity of patisiran-LNP. 
Infusion site findings: Infusion site findings were noted in all repeated dose toxicology studies, and were 
associated with vascular/perivascular inflammation at the injection site. Overall the findings were correlated 
with increases in inflammatory markers (monocytes, lymphocytes and NEU counts). Similar findings were 
noted in the 6-week monkey study and 39-week monkey study (similar incidence and severity in controls and 
treated animals).   
Spleen and Lymph nodes: The white pulp and marginal zone of the spleen were affected across rodent 
studies with lymphoid depletion/atrophy/necrosis observed in mice and rats along with histiocytosis in rats. 
No concomitant decreases in circulating lymphocytes or other signs of immunotoxicity were noted.  
Increased extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed in spleen of rats and mice following patisiran-LNP 
administration. In monkeys, red pulp hypocellularity was observed following patisiran-LNP administration. All 
of the splenic changes in rodents and monkeys were reversible.  
In rats, reversible lymphoid and stromal cell hyperplasia, histiocytosis, and inflammation were observed in 
lymph nodes in the 6-week (q2w×4) toxicity study but not in subsequent studies. There were no lymph node 
findings in mice or monkeys. 
Bone marrow: Bone marrow findings were present but of minor toxicological concern across species. They 
were limited to a minimal to moderate increases in myeloid cellularity. In rats, minimal to slight increases in 
hematopoietic hypercellularity in the bone marrow were reported at ≥0.15 mg/kg/q2w for 6 weeks (lowest 
dose tested) and at 1 mg/kg/q4w for 4 weeks. In the 26-week study in rats, increased M:E ratios were 
observed at ≥0.l mg/kg/q2w. In the 6-week (q2w×4) monkey study, increased M:E ratios were observed at≥ 
1 mg/kg/q2w. No findings were evident in the 39-week study in cynomolgus monkeys. However, as noted 
above, clearing antibodies significantly reduced exposures. 
Testis: In the 6-week general toxicity study (q2w×4), testicular/epididymal toxicity was noted in 2 males 
≥1.8 mg/kg. Findings included severe degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium and marked 
oligo/aspermia. It is notable that the findings in the testis were still present in the LD and HD even after the 
Assessment report

lengthy 60-day recovery period. However, the findings were not observed in longer duration rat or monkey 
studies, and no effects were evident on male rat fertility parameters or on sperm parameters in the 39 week 
monkey studies. Thus, while recognized, the finding is not further pursued. 
Adrenal gland: Minimal to slight cortical hypertrophy and increased absolute and relative adrenal weights 
(cortical hypertrophy) were noted in the 6-week rat study at ≥0.8 mg/kg. There were no findings after 
recovery and no adrenal gland findings in the 26-week study. Decreases in cortical vacuolation zona 
fasciculata) at 3 mg/kg/q2w in the monkey 6-week study was not replicated in the longer monkey study. 
Genotoxicity 
Patisiran-LNP (10 mg/mL) was neither mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, nor clastogenic or 
aneugenic in the mammalian chromosome aberration assay in human blood peripheral lymphocytes. While 
precipitation was a major problem in the in vitro studies, the validity of the studies has not been 
compromised. Single IV doses of patisiran-LNP at ≤ 30 mg/kg (MTD) did not induce micronucleus formation 
in the bone marrow of male and female CD-1 mice.It can be concluded that patisiran-LNP was not genotoxic 
in either the in vitro or in vivo assays. 
Carcinogenicity 
A 2-year carcinogenicity study of patisiran-LNP in rats was not conducted because of the technical challenges 
of long term IV administration of patisiran-LNP, and the immunogenicity (development of ADA) that was 
observed in the 26-week chronic rat study. However, a 26-week carcinogenicity was performed in TgRasH2 
mice. 
Survival rate was high (88-100%) in both controls and patisiran-LNP-treated groups, whereas in the positive 
control group there were significant decreases in male and female survival rates (40% and 16% 
respectively). Lung neoplastic findings (bronchioalveolar carcinoma and adenoma) were observed in treated 
male rats (0/25, 2/25, 4/25, and 3/25 males at 0, 0.5, 2, and 6 mg/kg/q2w patisiran-LNP, respectively). It is 
striking that no lung neoplastic findings is noted in the control group, whereas a total of 9 cases (in 75 
animals) were found in the treated groups. However, these tumors are common spontaneous tumors in 
TgRasH2 mice, and the findings in the study are not further considered. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Since ALN-18328 is not pharmacologically active in rats or rabbits, the rat-specific surrogate formulation AF-
011-18534 was used in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats to assess potential on-
target pharmacological effects of patisiran-LNP on reproduction and development.  
Fertility and embryo fetal development: No effects were noted on male or female reproductive parameters in 
a combined fertility and embryo fetal development study. Despite reductions in serum TTR(-90%), vitamin A 
(-79%) and thyroxine (-68%) which demonstrated the lack of a pharmacological effect of the patisiran-LNP 
surrogate on fertility or reproduction in males. At 1.5mg/kg AF-011-18534 there were increased foetal and 
litter incidences of foetuses with fused, wavy and thickened ribs. In addition, a statistically significant 
increase in the litter incidence of bifid thoracic centra was noted at 0.15mg/kg patisiran, and also at lower 
incidence 1.5mg/kg patisiran and AF-011-18534. However, these findings are considered developmental 
delays.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 42/188 
  
  
One foetus in the AF-011-18534 group had severe dilation of the lateral ventricles of the brain and a domed 
head. While a serious malformation, a single foetus without similar findings in other foetuses is considered a 
chance finding. 
In the rabbit embryo foetal development study, an increased incidence of adverse clinical signs, reduced 
maternal body weight gain, and reduced food consumption were observed at 0.6mg/kg. Thus, maternal 
NOAEL for patisiran-LNP is considered to be 0.3 mg/kg. Foetal visceral malformations, skeletal malformations 
and skeletal variations are present in single foetuses scattered at across dose groups without apparent 
systematicity. However, at 0.3mg/kg, one embryo presented dilated aortic arch and narrow pulmonary trunk 
and another embryo from a different litter presented persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septum 
defect. While seemingly disparate, they are all aspects of heart malformations sometimes seen in syndromes. 
Thus, the applicant was asked to further discuss these malformations and pay particular attention to a 
possible mode of action and transfer over the placenta of the different parts of the product. In the response, 
it was agreed that the mode of action behind the slight increase in foetal heart malformations at the mid-
dose (0.3 mg/kg) in the pivotal embryo-foetal development study in rabbits is unknown. The Applicant 
further described with data that in the dose range-finding embryo-foetal development study in pregnant 
rabbits, the foetal concentrations of foetal ALN-18328 and PEG2000-C-DMG concentrations were below 
detection limits at 0.3 mg/kg.  In addition, the mean foetal DLin-MC3-DMA concentration was 0.18% of its 
corresponding maternal plasma Cmax value. It is thus considered unlikely that the malformations are 
attributable to the patisiran-LNP components.  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function: The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and for 
viability and growth in the offspring for patisiran-LNP and AF-011-18534 were 1.5 mg/kg, the highest dose 
tested for patisiran-LNP and a dose of AF-011-18534 that essentially inhibited liver TTR production during 
organogenesis and lactation. 
Two hours post-dose on LD 12, no ALN-18328 or AD-18534 was detected in milk. Also no AF-011-18534-
related effects on serum TTR, vitamin A, or thyroid hormones in the F1 generation.  Milk DLin-MC3-DMA and 
PEG 2000-C-DMG concentrations in the 1.5 mg/kg patisiran-LNP were around 5% of their respective maternal 
plasma concentrations at LD12. 
Immunogenicity and immunostimulation  
Immunotoxicity has been evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey. The spleen is a 
target organ of toxicity in both species but there is no evidence of immunosuppression. Immunogenicity to 
biotherapeutic drugs in nonclinical species (as seen in the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats) is not 
generally predictive of the potential immunogenicity in humans. For this reason, the ADA responses in 
animals may be of limited value in predicting these responses in humans following patisiran-LNP 
administration. 
Serum complement and cytokines were evaluated in the single-dose and repeated dose (6-week and after 
the third dose in the 39-week) studies in cynomolgus monkey. Data from the 6-week study indicate that 
administration of patisiran-LNP or AF-011-1955 resulted in transient complement activation after 15 minutes, 
6h and 24 h after dosing. No adverse clinical signs were noted. The 39-week monkey study suggests that 
these transient increases do not lead to a long-term complement depletion. Also, the similarity in response 
for both patisiran-LNP and AF-011-1955 indicates that the response is independent of the specific siRNA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 43/188 
  
  
The immunostimulatory potential of the siRNA alone or when formulated in the LNP has also been 
investigated in vitro and in CD-1 mice. No signals indicative of a strong immunostimulatory potential were 
noted. 
Metabolites and impurities  
Metabolite toxicity studies were not conducted. The in vitro metabolic profiles and stability of ALN-18328, 
DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG in serum and liver S9 were similar among nonclinical species and 
humans. Overall, impurities have been qualified or adequately controlled. However, no bibliographic 
reference was given about the LOAEL which allowed to determine the PDE value of acetamide. The Applicant 
was asked to clarify this point and in the response specified the reference of the value used for the PDE 
calculation. This value was issued from the known Carcinogenic Potency Database (Gold database), from a 
chronic exposure carcinogenicity study performed on mice. At the low dose level, malignant lymphoma were 
reported. As no NOAEL was established, a specific safety factor of 10 was added. 
For linoleyl methane sulfonate, the PDE calculation proposed by the applicant was based on bibliographic 
data. Otherwise, the applicant refers to another acceptance limit of 60ppm described in module 3, but it was 
missing in the toxicological part of the dossier. In the response, the applicant specified that acceptance limit 
of 60ppm was a preliminary value. Given that actual concentration of linoleyl methanesulfonate is below the 
limit of detection of 0.6ppm, and considering the qualification of this impurity, this is acceptable. Considering 
that treatment with Onpattro is potentially life-long, the choice of employing less than lifetime (LTL) 
calculations in the estimations of total intake of potential genotoxic impurities was not adequately discussed 
by the applicant. However, according to ICH M7, it is possible to establish less-than-lifetime acceptable 
intakes for mutagenic impurities in pharmaceuticals. In the Application, the total number of dosing days for 
patisiran-LNP was determined by considering the once every 3-week dosing frequency and the total duration 
of treatment; the latter was determined considering the onset of hereditary transthyretin-mediated 
amyloidosis (typically between 30-50 years of age) and the life expectancy of a 30-year old in the US/Europe 
population (approximately an additional 50 years).  
Phototoxicity  
Patisiran-LNP has a peak absorbance at 260 nm and a molar extinction coefficient of approximately 42,500 L 
mol-1 cm-1 at 290 nm. It can thus be concluded that no dedicated phototoxicity studies are considered 
necessary. 
Hemolysis/Hemocompatibility 
No clinically relevant haemolysis or flocculation was observed in vitro in human whole blood treated with 
patisiran-LNP at final concentrations ≤400 µg/mL. These concentrations exceed the ALN-18328 plasma Cmax 
(7.15 μg/mL) at the RHD. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA for Patisiran-LNP was submitted in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*), 2006.

Introduction 
Patisiran-LNP, a novel synthetic ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutic, is being developed for the 
treatment of adult patients with hereditary transthyretin (TTR)-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis), 
with a dose regimen of 0.3 mg/kg by intravenous (IV) infusion, once every 3 weeks for chronic 
administration (i.e. lifetime dosing). 
The drug product, patisiran-LNP, is a sterile, preservative-free formulation of the siRNA, containing patisiran 
drug substance (ALN-18328) with lipid excipients in isotonic buffer, formulated as a concentrate for solution 
for infusion. The lipid excipients associate with the siRNA, protect it from immediate degradation in the 
circulatory system, and aid in delivery to the liver. The drug product is a homogenous solution of nucleic 
acid/lipid nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 60-100 nm. 
Phase I: Estimation of Exposure  
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity 
Thelog10Pow for patisiran drug substance (siRNA) was determined in buffer solutions of varying pH (4, 7, 9) 
using the OECD 107 octanol-water shake-flask method (Table 4). The study was GLP compliant. 
The octanol/water partition coefficient (Pow) of patisiran drug substance was found to be less than 7.7 in pH 
4, 7 and 9 solutions at 20°C. The log10Pow value of < -1.2 is clearly below log10Kow (log10Pow) of >4.5 
indicated by OSPAR convention and the CHMP guidance to be the threshold for further screening of 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT). 
Table 4 Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient Results for Patisiran-LNP 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
For orphan drug submissions, Fpen can be refined based on the prevalence on which the medicinal orphan 
drug designation, as adopted by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP), was based. In the 
approved orphan drug designation for patisiran, the prevalence of ATTR-mediated amyloidosis was 
considered to be not more than 0.2 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU/3/11/857). Accordingly, the 
prevalence of 0.2 in 10,000 people (0.00002) is used in the calculation for PECsw. 
The proposed dose of patisiran is 0.3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. This is equivalent to 17.4 doses per year 
(365 days/21 [21 days = 1 treatment cycle]) giving rise to a total dose of 5.22 mg/kg/year per patient, or 
313 mg/patient/year based on 60 kg body weight or 0.86 mg/patient/day based on 60 kg body weight. 
The PECSW was calculated as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 45/188 
  
  
 
 
 
Based on these data, the PECSW was calculated to 0.0000086 µg/L. This value is below the action limit of 
0.01 therefore a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was not considered required.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The drug product of Onpattro contains the active substance patisiran (a ds-siRNA) and in a lipid nanoparticle 
composed of four excipients whereof two (the lipid DLin-MC3-DMA and the PEGylated lipid PEG2000-C-DMG) 
are novel (and therefore requiring additional non-clinical assessment besides patisiran). The excipients are 
part of the LNP that has the purpose of both stabilizing and targeting the ds-siRNA towards the liver. The 
novel excipient DLin-MC3-DMA supports LNP particle formation, cellular uptake of the LNP via endocytosis, 
and endosomal release of the ds-siRNA into the cytosol. PEG2000-C-DMG is exposed on the surface of 
patisiran-LNP and has the purpose to stabilize the LNP. 
Pharmacology: The target of the active substance, patisiran, is the TTR mRNA expression in the human liver 
(and consequently an overall reduction of serum TTR protein levels). It is a primate and human gene 
sequence specific siRNA that is able to reduce TTR expression (mRNA and protein) in various test systems 
(this has led to the use of a rodent specific surrogate ds-siRNA in some of the non-clinical studies). While it is 
not clear if the patisiran inhibition effect is the same for all possible TTR polymorphisms, the in-vitro 
inhibition range for the five more common human transthyretin disease-linked polymorphisms (V30M, T60A, 
S77Y, S77F, and V122I) is relatively similar at an IC50 between ~16pM and 36pM. The LNP formulation does 
not seem to influence the extent of the inhibition in-vitro. The cynomolgus monkeys serum TTR level 
reduction ranges between 46% and 75% (0.03-0.3mg/kg) after a single dose and between 65% and 91% 
after repeated dosing (q3w or q4w; 0.15-0.5mg/kg). The TTR suppression works slowly in-vivo, taking 4-8d 
to reach a maximum effect in cynomolgus monkeys after a single dose and 9-12w with repeated dosing (~3 
doses). Increasing the number of doses increases the recovery period before the TTR protein levels return to 
pre-exposure levels (with 24w administration requiring 9-12w recovery in both rodents and cynomolgus 
monkeys). Secondary effects to patisiran-LNP treatment are ~40-80% reductions in blood levels of RBP, T4 
(but not T3) and Vitamin A (indicating that care has to be taken in the context of planned pregnancies) within 
2-3w of the first dosing. The recovery period to pre-exposure levels of these downstream biomolecules 
increases with longer administration periods and with higher doses (to >60d at the max dose of 3mg/kg in 
cynomolgus monkeys). The safety pharmacological assessment did not find that the LNP with a siRNA 
directed against insect luciferase has a hERG effect. Cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated a transient (up to 
~50h) increased body temperature and heart rate after single patisiran=LNP infusion at 3 to 6mg/kg but the 
mechanisms underlying this effect remains unclear.   
Pharmacokinetics: The PK studies used animal exposure to patisiran-LNP and then subsequent specific 
measurement of the siRNA and the two excipients, making it difficult to assess the exact kinetic properties of 
the whole of patisiran-LNP. Overall, systemic plasma exposure was higher and half-lives longer in 
cynomolgus monkeys compared to rats for all the three patisiran-LNP components (DLin-MC3-DMA remaining 
the longest in the body) with no indication of a sex-specific profile. The patisiran-LNP had low reported

Page 47/188 
  
  
 
protein-binding ability (~0.5-2.1%) but the exact values remain unclear due to the semi-quantitative nature 
of the quantification method (SDS-PAGE/densitometry). The levels of the ds-siRNA were more than dose 
proportional in rats and in primates (based on comparing the low-to-middle and low-to-high doses). The 
cynomolgus monkey clearance reduced with increasing dose and increased t1/2 (up to 14.7-19.1h). This 
dose-related increase in ds-siRNA t1/2 was also observed in toxicological repeated dose studies in monkey. 
Regarding the novel excipients, the t1/2 of DLin-MC3-DMA increased with dose in rat but not cynomolgus 
monkeys. That being said, overall, the t1/2 was longer in cynomolgus monkeys (up to 428-780h) compared 
to rat (up to 246-288h). The t1/2 for PEG 2000-C-DMG was also longer for cynomolgus monkeys (160-162h 
after 1h infusion) than for rat (21.3h after single bolus dose). PEG2000-C-DMG is believed to desorb from the 
LNP with an estimated desorption rate of 45% per hour. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against PEG2000-C-DMG 
were found in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys.  
The liver was the main uptake organ for patisiran-LNP followed by weak to moderate uptake in spleen (1.61-
1.67% of total dose), kidney (0.14-0.42% of total dose), lungs (0.21-0.57% of total dose), heart (0.07-
0.24% of total dose) and adrenals (0.03-0.14% of total dose) – indicating a preference for sinusoidal organs. 
Based on a rat QWBA study (and based on a radiolabelled DLin-MC3-DMA), the LNP-based liver targeting 
approach of Onpattro is effective as the liver seems to receive most of the patisiran-LNP dose (>90%) with a 
tissue tmax between 1h and 6h. A siRNA specific method (the PNA-probe HPLC method) indicates that much 
of the ds-siRNA is rapidly removed as the rat liver contains 25.6% of all siRNA at 1h but only 0.56% after 
24h. For DLin-MC3-DMA, the uptake into the liver was 77.7% of the total dose in rat (with 25% left after 2w) 
and >97% of the total dose in cynomolgus monkeys (with 43% left after 2w). The levels of DLin-MC3-DMA in 
the cynomolgus monkeys liver indicate that the uptake is more than dose proportional between the low dose 
(0.03mg/kg) and middle dose (0.30mg/kg) and proportional between the middle dose and high dose 
(1.0mg/kg) and that there may be a possibility for DLin-MC3-DMA to accumulate in the liver with a q3w 
administration scenario. For PEG 2000-C-DMG, ~49% of the total dose was taken up in the rat liver within 1h 
(with a rapid elimination to 0.81% after 7d). The 1h levels in cynomolgus monkeys liver are unclear but, 
similar to rat, 0.86% remains after 7d.  
In liver microsomes from patisiran-LNP treated animals (1mg/kg/day 1h IV, biweekly for 4 doses), there 
were no significant changes in the protein levels/activities of CYP1A1/2, CYP2C76, CYP2C43, CYP2D6, CYP3A 
or UGT1A1. The ds-siRNA itself undergoes exonuclease degradation over time. Following 24h patisiran-LNP 
post-exposure, there was 62-71% intact siRNA in rodent serum, 42-44% in cynomolgus monkey serum and 
~100% in human serum. Out of six DLin-MC3-DMA metabolites detected in rat, one hydrolysis metabolite (4-
Dimethylaminobutyric acid or DMBA) was also detected in cynomolgus monkeys and humans. Regarding 
PEG2000-C-DMG, a total of 6 O-detetradecylation metabolites were detected in cynomolgus monkey and 
human but none in rodents. Overall, for both in-vivo rat and monkey, no plasma metabolites of >10% of the 
total dose were detected. 
In both rats and monkeys, patisiran-LNP radioactivity (radiolabelled DLin-MC3-DMA) was primarily recovered 
in the urine (~49% in rats and ~50% in cynomolgus monkeys) with some excreted in the faeces (~24% in 
rats and ~10% in monkeys). No intact patisiran was recovered in either urine or faeces of rats or monkeys. 
There are indications that some of the biliary excretion of radiolabelled DLin-MC3-DMA is reabsorbed and 
then excreted via the kidneys. PEG2000-C-DMG was only detected in faeces but not in urine.  
Toxicology: The non-clinical toxicological program was in line with the ICH M3(R2) guideline, covering repeat-
dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity. Only the cynomolgus monkey was a 
‘pharmacologically active’ animal model for patisiran-LNP although some rodent studies (the DART studies) 
used rodent-specific ds-siRNA-LNP combinations. The latter allowed the investigation of the patisiran induced

secondary reductions of vitamin A during development in rat. Supplementary studies have been performed to 
evaluate excipients and immunostimulation. Overall, the liver is the main target organ to patisiran-LNP 
toxicity (hepatotoxicity defining the NOAELs/LOAELs in both rodents and non-rodents) which is in line with it 
having the greatest uptake. Hepatotoxicity signs in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys were hepatocyte 
single-cell necrosis, vacuolation and liver inflammation/infiltration. Based on studies using a sham-LNP (ds-
siRNA against insect luciferase), the observed toxicities are to a large degree likely due to the LNP part 
ofpatisiran-LNP. Secondary to the liver, the spleen was also a target organ, demonstrating lymphoid 
depletion/atrophy/necrosis in rodents and red pulp hypocellularity in primates. An evaluation of 
immunotoxicity indicates that both primate and mouse-specific ds-siRNA-LNP administration induced 
transient complement activation within 15min to 24h of administration. Vascular/perivascular inflammation at 
the infusion site was a common finding across studies. No other associated clinical signs were detected. No 
genotoxicity was found for patisiran-LNP, and while there were some signs of increased number of neoplasms 
in transgene mice after 26w exposure, these were considered to be within the mouse strain’s background 
occurrences of neoplasms. In the DART studies, no developmental toxicity besides some developmental 
delays was observed in the rat studies despite marked reductions in vitamin A and thyroxine. Some 
uncommon cardiac malformations were found in rabbits that were exposed to patisiran-LNP (i.e. non-rabbit 
specific ds-siRNA) but due to toxicokinetic considerations, it is at this point considered unlikely that these 
effects are linked to patisiran-LNP. No effects were observed in the pre-postnatal toxicity studies. There were 
also no signs of reductions in serum TTR, vitamin A, or thyroid hormones in the F1 offspring generation. 
Specific metabolite toxicity studies were not conducted. The excipients DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG 2000-CDMG 
were only evaluated in genotoxicity tests and measured in TK analyses. Impurities have been qualified or 
adequately controlled. Phototoxicity studies were not considered to be necessary. 
Overall, and as noted in the RMP, the non-clinical data indicates that the toxicological effects of Onpattro 
seem to be dependent on the LNP part (although the non-clinical data and the literature does not fully rule 
out a contribution from nucleotide sequence-unspecific toxic effects) and that likely toxicological targets are 
the liver, the spleen and the infusion site (the latter also being observed clinically). Considering that the 
indication calls for life-long treatment, potential clinical effects on these organs from chronic exposure should 
be kept in mind. 
An ERA for Patisiran-LNP was submitted in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*), 2006. The log10Pow 
was determined below 4.5 therefore no further PBT studies were considered necessary. Based on the PECSW 
value < 0.01μg/L, a Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis was not required. It can thus be 
concluded that patisiran-LNP in the proposed use, does not pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data were considered by the CHMP sufficient to support the application for a 
marketing authorisation of Onpattro in the treatment of adult patients with hereditary transthyretin 
amyloidosis (hATTR). 
The CHMP furthermore concluded that Onpattro was not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Following the routine GCP 
inspection (reference number INS/GCP/2018/001) conducted at one clinical investigator site in Spain and at 
the sponsor Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA, several deficiencies were noted in the preliminary inspection 
report. Concerns were raised on GCP compliance and data reliability and therefore a follow up inspection was 
requested to address issues identified in trial management; monitoring process and data management 
(systems set up and audit trail). 
The inspectors in conjunction with the assessment team recommended that the CRO responsible for the 
study conduct (Medpace) and an additional clinical investigator site to be inspected. This would allow to 
follow up on the issues observed and to assess the impact of the findings on the overall study and the clinical 
data submitted in support of the MAA.  
The triggered GCP inspection has resulted in the recommendation to exclude the data from Site 061 in 
Mallorca, Spain, from the analyses. At this site, 5 patients were enrolled for study 004. Further, as a Central 
Assessment Site (CAS), this site also assessed efficacy endpoints for 7 additional patients from other 
sites.The Applicant provided the results of MMRM and binary analyses excluding these 12 patients who had 
efficacy assessments performed at the Mallorca site. Overall, the MMRM analyses and binary analysis results 
of mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DNafter excluding the 12 patients were consistent with the results from the 
whole mITT population.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
Plasma, urine and plasma ultra-filtrate concentrations of ALN-18328 (drug substance) were determined with 
a liquid chromatography fluorescence detection assay method. The concentration of ALN-18328 was 
determined by annealing a complementary fluorescent RNA probe (Atto-probe) to the antisense strand of the 
duplex. Ion exchange HPLC was used to separate the Atto-probe: antisense complex from the antiprobe: 
sense complex and the excess Atto-probe and anti-probe reagents. ALN-18328 was monitored using an 
excitation wavelength of 615 nm and an emission wavelength of 640 nm.  
Plasma concentrations of PEG2000-C-DMG were determined with an LC-MS/MS method using PEG2000-C-
DMA as internal standard. Samples were processed by protein-precipitation extraction. PEG2000-C-DMG was 
monitored using the MS/MS transition of 893.2 → 726.1.  
Plasma concentrations of DLin-MC3-DMA were determined with an LC-MS/MS method using DB-449-27-1 as 
internal standard. Samples were processed by protein-precipitation extraction. DLin-MC3-DMA was monitored 
using the MS/MS transition of 642.5 → 132.0. Two methods were developed and validated; low range and 
high range.

Immunogenicity Assays  
The presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA; defined as serum IgG/IgM antibodies specific to PEG2000-C-DMG) 
were assessed in all clinical studies. An ADA assay that detected antibodies to PEG2000-C-DMG was developed 
since PEG2000-C-DMG is exposed on the surface of the LNP, and antibodies generated against PEG2000-C-DMG 
may impact PK exposure of the patisiran-LNP components. 
The immunogenicity testing strategy used in all clinical studies followed regulatory guidance. Serum samples 
were first assessed for the presence of ADA using a screening assay. The samples that tested positive for 
ADA in the screening assay were subject to further testing with a confirmatory assay. Titer analysis was 
performed on those samples that tested positive in the confirmatory assay. 
In the anti-PEG antibody ELISA assay, PEG2000-C-DMG is coated onto the plate, and captured anti-PEG 
antibodies are detected using a bi-specific goat anti-human IgG+IgM antibody coupled to horseradish 
peroxidase. The validation parameters were established based on 50 individual healthy donors serum 
samples (25 males and 25 females). 
A neutralizing assay for ADA was not developed because any clinically significant ADA response would be 
detected most readily and reliably by the reduced ability to lower serum TTR concentrations, which is a 
robust biomarker of patisiran-LNP activity in all clinical studies. 
Evaluation and Qualification of Models 
Population PK 
Separate popPK models for ALN-18328 and lipids (DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG) were developed. The 
models were fit to collected PK data from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies (study 001, 002, 003, 004 and 005). A 
semi-mechanistic model for ALN-18328 was constructed with initial uptake clearance from plasma to liver, 
followed by redistribution between liver and plasma compartment, and elimination through hepatic clearance. 
Overall the updated PopPK model for ALN-18328 was considered acceptable. Final PK parameter estimates 
are provided in Table 6 below.

Two separate 3 compartment models were developed for DLin-MC3-DMa and PEG2000-C-DMG. The PK models 
for both components are considered sufficient to describe the PK data for both components. Final PK 
parameter estimates of DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG are provided in the Table 7 and Table 8 below.

Absorption  
The bioavailability of the drug is 100% as patisiran-LNP is administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Comparability 
Patisiran-LNP was manufactured using 3 different buffers for the ALN-18328 solution.  As the changes were 
made at the same time as manufacturing batch scale up, patisiranLNP produced by each process is hereafter 
described by the corresponding batch scale (Batch scale 1, 2 or 3).  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 55/188 
  
  
 
The overall PK exposure for ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG as indicated by AUClast appeared 
to be slightly lower for Batch scale 1 compared to the Batch scale 2.  
For Batch scale 3 the PK exposure for ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG as indicated by 
Ctrough appears to be similar to compared to the Batch scale 2. However the number of patients receiving the 
Batch scale 3 is limited compared with the Batch scale 2. 
Distribution 
Mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of ALN-18328 in healthy volunteers (0.342 to 2.10 L/kg) 
over the dose range studied were markedly higher than typical blood volume in human, suggesting 
distribution of ALN-18328 into tissues. Following patisiran-LNP   0.3 mg/kg q3w IV dosing in patients, mean 
Vss±SD was 0.255±0.198 L/kg. Mean±SD Vss of the lipids DLin-MC3-DMA, and PEG2000-C-DMG at steady 
state was 0.470 ± 0.238, and 0.130±0.050 L/kg, respectively.  
Patisiran LNP binding to plasma protein was investigated using FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) 
followed by SDS-PAGE quantification. Patisiran-LNP had a low binding to rat serum albumin (0.89%), human 
serum albumin (0.46%), and human a1-acid glycoprotein (2.07), however the accuracy of these results is 
difficult to determine due to the assay used. 
Elimination, excretion and metabolism 
Following patisiran-LNP 0.3 mg/kg IV in patients, mean ± SD steady state CL of ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA, 
and PEG2000-C-DMG were 3.0±2.5, 2.1±0.8 and 2.1±0.6 mL/h/kg, respectively. The mean ±SD terminal 
elimination half-life (t 1/2β) of ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA, and PEG2000-C-DMG were approximately 3.2±1.8, 
10.9±1.8 and 3.8±1.1 days, respectively.  
ALN-18328 concentrations in plasma filtrate were generally less than 5% of plasma concentrations. This low 
concentration of un-encapsulated “free” ALN-18328 confirms that the LNPs are stable and the siRNA 
remained encapsulated in the LNP formulation. 
No human ADME study was performed because of the long terminal half-life of patisiran-LNP and the 
consequent health hazard from prolonged exposure to radioactivity in healthy subjects.  
In study 001 and 002 after one or two doses of patisiran-LNP the mean urine fe for ALN 18328 was less than 
1%, indicating that renal excretion was a minor route of elimination for ALN 18328. 
In healthy volunteers, 5.5% of DLin-MC3-DMA was recovered after 96 h as its metabolite, DMBA 
(dimethylamino butyric acid) in urine.   
In rats and monkeys, PEG2000C-DMG is eliminated unchanged in the bile. PEG2000-C-DMG excretion in 
humans was not measured.  
ALN-18328 and PEG2000-C-DMG was not metabolised in vitro by any of the tested CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5).   
DLin-MC3-DMA was metabolized to a minor extent by human CYP CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2C19, but not by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2D6. No in vivo data are available so the clinical consequence is 
unknown. The metabolites observed are formed by single- and multiple-oxidation and by carboxylation. 
Hydrolysis (non CYP pathway) appears to be involved in elimination of DLin_MC3-DMA to form DMBA.

No specific uptake for ALN-18328 and PEG2000-C-DMG in any of the investigated transporter P-gp, BCRP and 
BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K was observed.  
For DLin-MC3-DMA it was not possible to investigate the transport by P-gp, BCRP and BSEP. At 3 µM DLin-
MC3-DMA did not appear to be a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and 
MATE2-K. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The exposure to ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG 2000-C-DMG increased dose proportionally after single 
and repeated administration over the dose range 0.01-0.5 mg/kg.  
In patients at steady state the accumulation ratio (RAC) for ALN-18328 was 1.74 fold for Cmax, and 3.16 fold 
for AUC.  For DLin-MC3-DMA, the RAC was for AUCτ was 1.76-fold and Ctrough was 2.79-fold compared to first 
dose. For PEG2000-C-DMG accumulation was minimal. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
After administration of 0.3 mg/kg qW3 in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy, the steady state 
was observed after week 24.  All 3 compounds showed a rapid initial decline followed by a prolonged shallow 
phase with t 1/2β values of approximately 76 hours, 260 hours and 90 hours for ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA 
and PEG2000-C-DMG, respectively. The PK profile and PK parameters of ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA and 
PEG 2000-C-DMG are shown in Figure 5 and Table 9 below.

Special populations 
Several covariates were tested in the ALN-18328 popPK model. Based on the popPK analysis, age, gender, 
race, mild and moderate renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment were not significant covariates. 
In the pivotal Phase 3 Study 004, a total of 137 (92.6%), 10 (6.8%) and 1 (0.7%) patients had normal 
hepatic function (BIL ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST ≤ ULN) and mild hepatic impairment (BIL ≤ ULN 
and AST > ULN) or (ULN < BIL ≤ 1.5 x ULN), and moderate hepatic impairment (1.5 ULN < BIL ≤ 3 x ULN), 
respectively.  PK subgroup analysis indicated that there was no difference in steady state PK exposures 
(Cmax_ss, Cp_ss(30min) and Ctrough_ss) for patients with normal and mild hepatic impairment.  
Most patients (141/199) studied had normal renal function while 40 and 18 patients, had mild or moderate 
renal impairment, respectively. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate if dose adjustment was needed in Study 004. Results 
indicated that there were no meaningful differences in steady state plasma concentrations of ALN-18328 in 
any sub-group - age, gender, V30M mutation status, mild and moderate renal impairment, and mild hepatic 
impairment subgroups. PK exposures and TTR reduction was similar in patients regardless of age, gender, 
V30M mutation status, mild and moderate renal impairment, or mild hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose 
adjustment was deemed necessary in any subgroup.  
The risk for increased exposure in patients with hepatic impairment for DLIn-MC3-DMA was discussed and 
taken into consideration that the CYP enzymes are not involved in its metabolism it can be considered that 
there is no obvious reason to restrict the use in patients with hepatic impairment due to DLIn-MC3-DMA. 
However as PEG2000-C-DMG might be eliminated via the bile it cannot be excluded that patients with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment will have increased exposure of the PEG2000-C-DMG part.  
No dedicated study in subjects with renal and hepatic impairment was performed with patisiran–LNP. It was 
also noted the limited data for including hepatically impaired (all grades of impairment) and renally 
(moderate and severe) impaired patients  as covariates in the popPK analyses in order to guide posology in 
these special populations.  
Based on the above considerations, no formal contraindication for patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment or severe to terminal renal impairment was deemed necessary to be included in the SmPC. 
However, Patisiran-LNP should not be used in these patients unless the anticipated clinical benefits outweigh 
the potential risks (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
As patisiran–LNP is given via IV infusion the initial drug-drug interaction assessment was made using the 
relevant cut off is Cmaxu* 50. Where protein binding was unknown the total concentration is used as a worst 
case scenario.

CYP inhibition 
ALN-18328 did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 activity using pooled human 
liver microsomes at concentrations up to 6.3 µM (~85 µg/mL). For CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 the IC50 was 
determined to >74.5 µM (1000 µg/mL) and 45.3 µM (~600 µg/mL); however, the risk of a clinical relevant 
DDI due to direct CYP inhibition is considered to be low. For ALN-18328 no time-dependent inhibition (TDI) 
was observed for any of the CYPs tested, except for CYP2B6. The effect on CYP2B6 in vivo is not known.  
DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000-C-DMG did not show either direct or TDI of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5.  
In vitro, DLin-MC3-DMA or PEG2000-C-DMG did not show time-dependent inhibition (TDI) for any of the CYP 
isoforms tested. For ALN-18328 no TDI was observed for any of the CYPs tested, except for CYP2B6. The 
effect in vivo is not known. 
Induction 
Patisiran-LNP did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4. For CYP2B6 a concentration dependent and >2 fold increase 
of mRNA levels compared to vehicle control was observed in incubations in cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes. The effect on CYP2B6 in vivo is not known. DLin-MC3-DMA (up to 30 µM) and PEG2000-C-DMG 
(up to 75 µM) did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA after incubation in cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes.   
Transporter inhibition 
ALN-18328 was tested at adequate concentrations and inhibition was observed for OATP1B1, OAT1 and OCT2 
however no it  was not possible to calculate an IC 50 as the inhibition was <50%. It is considered unlikely that 
ALN-18328 is an in vivo relevant inhibitor of OATP1B1, OAT1 and OCT2 based on in vitro data. The highest 
tested concentration for DLin-MC3-DMA and was much lower compared to the calculated cut off 
concentration. For DLin-MC3-DMA there is probably not possible to do further experiments using higher 
concentrations with vesicles due to solubility issues. PEG2000-C-DMG did inhibit the transporters P-gp, OAT1 
and MATE1in vitro Considering the extensive protein binding (97% bound), a.clinical relevant inhibition of 
OAT1 and MATE1 is considered unlikely.  
Dose/Exposure-Response 
A PK/PD model was developed linking the plasma ALN-18328 predicted from the popPK model to serum TTR 
using  an indirect response model. The dose-response simulations and the observed dose-response curve 
from 3 pooled studies indicate that choosing the 0.3 mg/kg dose for phase 3 was adequate, (see Figure 6 
below for the observed data).

Disease progression modelling 
The purpose of the disease-progression modelling was to evaluate the relationship between serum TTR and 
modified neuropathy impairment score +7 (mNIS+7) changes in hATTR patients with polyneuropathy. 
Repeated mNIS+7 data collected from patients in Study 003 (24 months follow up) and Study 004 (18 
months follow up) following treatment with patisiran-LNP or placebo were pooled, Figure 7. A population 
mixed effects model of disease progression (i.e., mNIS+7 progression) was developed that related the 
progression of mNIS+7 as a function of on-treatment TTR levels in patients.

2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
ALN-18328 acts by binding to and activating the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to inhibit the 
synthesis of wild-type (wt) and mutant TTR protein in hepatocytes expected to resulting in a reduction in 
circulating TTR levels. 
According to the applicant the therapeutic hypothesis is that the reduction of liver-derived circulating 
amyloidogenic TTR protein by patisiran-LNP will reduce the deposition and promote the stabilization or 
clearance of TTR amyloid deposits, thereby stabilizing or improving the disease manifestations including 
polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy and improving overall health. Supportive data referred to by the 
applicant for the hypothesis include: 1) the ability of OLT (which eliminates circulating mutant TTR) to slow 
disease progression in select patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy; 2) the patisiran-LNP 
Phase 3 trial in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, wherein  patisiran-LNP-mediated 
reductions in serum TTR protein led to a statistically significant slowing of neuropathy progression and 
improvement in QoL relative to placebo; and 3) the demonstration that siRNA-mediated serum TTR reduction 
in a human V30M TTR transgenic mouse model resulted in reduction of TTR protein deposition and regression 
of established TTR protein deposits in nerves and gastrointestinal tract.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Two Phase 1 patisiran-LNP single ascending dose (SAD) studies in healthy volunteers (ALN-TTR02-001 and 
ALN-TTR02-005 referenced as “Study 001” and “Study 005”) contributed pharmacodynamic (PD) 
assessments (eg, TTR levels).  Study ALN-TTR02-002 (referenced as "Study 002") was a Phase 2 multiple 
ascending dose (MAD) study that contributed PD in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy; 
this study supported the selection of the patisiran-LNP dose and regimen for continued development. It 
included assessments of serum TTR levels. 
In addition, ALN-TTR02-004 (the pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study), ALN-
TTR02-003 (a Phase 2 open-label, single-arm, long-term follow-up extension study) and ALN-TTR02-006 (an 
ongoing open-label, single-arm, long-term follow-up extension study of patients who completed Studies 003 
and 004) provided data on primary pharmacology. 
Mean TTR concentrations at baseline were generally similar in healthy volunteers (mean: 241 to 336 μg/mL) 
(Study 001 and Study 005) and patients (mean: 197 to 276 μg/mL) (Study 002 and Study 004).  Dose-
dependent reductions in serum TTR concentrations were observed after single dose patisiran LNP in both 
healthy volunteers (Study 001 and Study 005) and in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy 
(Study 002).  In the pooled analysis of Studies 001, 005, and 002, the patisiran-LNP dose of 0.15 mg/kg was 
on the steep phase of the dose-response curve, resulting in less TTR reduction (75.4%) compared with 0.3 
mg/kg and greater variability in PD response. The patisiran-LNP dose of 0.5 mg/kg (n=1) was on the plateau 
of the dose-response curve, resulting in only a marginal increase (4.7%) in TTR reduction compared with 0.3 
mg/kg. The 0.5 mg/kg dose was not pursued in clinical studies after Study 001 because of the minimal 
observed difference in TTR reduction and the occurrence of an acute IRR at the start of infusion.  
The maximum percent TTR reduction from baseline was observed within 10 to 14 days after the first dose. 
After a single dose of up to 0.5 mg/kg in healthy volunteers, TTR concentrations generally returned to 
baseline within 70 days. Sustained TTR reduction between doses was consistently achieved with 0.3 mg/kg 
q3w, where maximum TTR reductions of up to 96% were observed.  A more sustained TTR reduction 
between doses was observed for a patisiran LNP dose of 0.3 mg/kg given q3w than q4w.  
In the Phase 2 open-label extension Study 003, long term dosing with patisiran LNP 0.3 mg/kg q3w sustained 
a mean TTR reduction of approximately 80% over 2 years of treatment with an average maximum percent 
reduction of 92.5%.  Similar profiles of sustained mean maximum TTR reduction were also observed in Phase 
3 Study 004 (87.8% over 18 months) and the global open-label extension Study 006 (83.55% over 13 
months for patients who were on placebo in Study 004 and initiated treatment with patisiran-LNP in Study 
006).  This PD effect supports long term dosing with patisiran LNP to consistently maintain low TTR 
concentrations. 
Similar and consistent mean reductions in TTR levels over 18 months were achieved in patients with V30M 
and non V30M TTR genotypes, which is expected given the mechanism of action. 
Serum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP), which facilitates transport of vitamin A in the blood. 
Secondary PD effects were assessed by measurement of vitamin A and RBP concentrations. 
A dose-dependent reduction in vitamin A and RBP concentrations were observed in studies 001, 002 and 005. 
Over the course of the 18 month treatment period in the pivotal study 004, the mean percent reduction in 
vitamin A concentrations was 62.4% in the patisiran-LNP group and 0.2% in the placebo group. The mean 
percent reduction in RBP concentrations was 45.3% in the patisiran-LNP group and 0.48% in the placebo 
group. For patients who received patisiran-LNP, mean percent reductions in vitamin A and RBP concentrations 
over 18 months were also similar across the subgroups of age, sex, genotype, and prior tetramer stabilizer

use. 
In study 003, overall over the 24-month treatment period serum vitamin A levels were reduced by >67% and 
RBP levels were reduced by >65%. 
In study 006 baseline mean serum vitamin A levels in the 004 patisiran-LNP and 003 patisiran-LNP groups 
did not result in additional decreases in vitamin A over 52 weeks. In the 004 placebo group a mean vitamin A 
reduction of 63.91% at Week 52 was observed following administration of patisiran-LNP. 
According to the Applicant, the impact of the reduced vitamin A or RBP levels is not anticipated to result in 
adverse events related to these reductions because transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur 
through alternative mechanisms in the absence of RBP [Biesalski, H.K., et al., Biochemical but not clinical 
vitamin A deficiency results from mutations in the gene for retinol binding protein. Am J Clin Nutr, 1999, van 
Bennekum, A.M., et al., Biochemical basis for depressed serum retinol levels in transthyretin-deficient mice. J 
Biol Chem, 2001]. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
ADME 
No labelled human mass-balance data is available, and this is acceptable, since patisiran-LNP drug substance 
ALN-18328 is a small interfering RNA and the fate of this type of molecules is well known. Further, it is 
reassuring that the excretion of ALN-18328 in urine has been measured and that this seems to be limited, 
less than 1% after single and repeated dosing of the product. Whether plasma exposure can be seen as 
surrogate for the local exposure in the hepatocytes is not entirely clear, however as “the second phase” of 
the PK profile probably reflects redistribution from the liver some association cannot be excluded. 
For the elimination of DLin-MC3-DMA the Applicant refers to rat and monkey ADME studies, where a majority 
of DLin-MC3-DMA is stated to be eliminated as DMBA (dimethylamino butyric acid) in urine. DMBA is also 
found in human urine (5.5% of the dose), but was only collected for a short interval (up to 96 h, much 
shorter than plasma t½, while in monkey a plateau was reached after ca 10 weeks). In vitro DLin-MC3-DMA 
was metabolised by several CYP enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, but to a minor 
extent. Hydrolysis (non CYP pathway) appears to be involved in the elimination of DLin-MC3-DMA to form 
DMBA. The fate of the remaining part, the lipid chain, is not known.   
Based on nonclinical data PEG 2000-C-DMG seems not to be extensively metabolized and is suggested to be 
eliminated unchanged through the hepatobiliary tract to the faeces. Based on the presented data the 
elimination is similar in humans as well, i.e. with little to no metabolism and mainly biliary excretion.However 
it is still unknown whether transporters (but not substrate for P-gp, BCRP or BSEP) could be involved. Based 
on the preclinical findings it seems that the observed preclinical toxicology after administration of patisiran-
LNP is linked to the LNP and not the siRNA.   
The elimination in humans of the two new lipids DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG 2000-C-DMG is largely unknown.  As a 
consequence of the uncertainty of the elimination pathways and narrow exposure margins to nonclinical 
adverse findings, caution when used in  in special populations is warranted. Patisiran-LNP should not be used 
in patients with moderate or severe renal and/or hepatic impairment unless the anticipated clinical benefits 
outweigh the potential risks. This is appropriately reflected in SmPC section 4.2. 
Population PK and PK/PD analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 66/188 
  
  
In the initial Population PK model there were apparent inconsistencies of the Population PK and PK/PD 
analysis. An updated popPK model was provided due to the raised issues regarding the structural PK model, 
weight allometric scaling, fixed PK parameters, covariates selection, estimated highly RUV (random and 
unexplained variability), its poor predictive performance and unreliable model derived secondary PK 
parameters.  
A semi-mechanistic PK model was used to describe the typical PK profile of ALN-18328 with the observed two 
phases (rapid initial decline and second peak). To the three fixed (CL12, CL20, V1), four random (BSV on 
CL12, CL20, V1; RUV additive on the log-scale) effects, three random effects were added (inter-occasion 
variability (IOV) on CL12, CL20 and V1) and also estimated in the updated PK model. CL23 and CL32 fixed in 
the original PK model (according to applicant to stabilize the model) were here estimated in the updated 
model. In addition, allometric scaling has been tested and finally a standard reduction step (without using a 
full covariate model) has been used in the updated model. Based on the PopPK model discrimination, the -
2LL (and the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)) was considerably improved with 6315.2 (6355.2) vs 6806 
(6848) for the updated vs original PK model. Allometric scaling by weight was not retained (increase of the -
2LL, -twice the log-likelihood). Estimated PK parameters were similar (<20% difference) except for R1 and 
R2 and estimated exponent for weight on CL12 between original and updated PK model. Final covariates 
included were only weight and healthy status on CL12, Race on CL20 and Batch scale 1 on relative 
bioavailability (Frel). IOV have been estimated at 19.7%, 43.6% and 6.1% respectively on CL12, CL20 and 
V1. RUV have decreased from 52.1 to 45.9% and would not be reduced more. Predictive performance based 
on pcVPC (prediction-corrected Visual Predictive Check) was similar between the original and the updated 
model. Overall the updated PopPK model for ALN-18328 is considered acceptable. In addition, discrepancies 
were highlighted between post-hoc parameters and typical patients derived from the original PopPK model for 
both CL (0.464 vs 0.253 L/h) and Vd (46.7 vs 24.1 L). The differences were identified to be due to errors in 
calculation of steady state PK metrics. The steady state NCA derived PK parameters were actually derived 
from the first dose instead of steady state. The submitted updated results were in agreement with both CL 
(0.202 vs 0.253 L/h) and Vd (18.8 vs 24.1 L). 
Two separates 3 compartment models were developed for DLin-MC3-DMa and PEG2000-C-DMG. For both 
updated reduced popPK model were provided with estimation of IOV terms. For both, PK parameters were 
similar (<20% difference) between original and updated PK model. Predictive performance based on pcVPC 
was similar between the original and the updated model. The updated PK model for both components was 
considered sufficient to capture both components PK.  
The dose-response analysis supports that ALN-18328 affects TTR levels and that 0.3 mg/kg. 
The 30 mg flat dose was chosen for safety reasons for patients weighing more than 100 kg. The highest body 
weight in patient studied was 110 kg. The popPK analysis was used by the applicant to show that a flat dose 
of 30 mg was adequate for patients weighing up to 120 kg, however the initial popPK model has concerns 
including the body weight based allometric scaling exponents. During the building of the updated popPK 
model, body weight allometric scaling with fixed coefficient of 0.75 on CL and 1 on V were tested. For safety 
reasons the flat dose approach with a maximum dose of 30 mg for patients weighing over 100 kg is 
supported. This was also supported by similar TTR lowering in the patients with body weight < 100 kg ≥ 100 
kg in the  Phase 3 Study 004. 
Drug-drug Interactions 
No clinically relevant direct CYP inhibition is expected to be caused by ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA or PEG2000-
C-DMG. Also, DLin-MC3-DMA or PEG2000-C-DMG did not show time-dependent inhibition (TDI) against any of 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 67/188 
  
  
the CYP isoforms tested. For ALN-18328 no TDI was observed for any of the CYPs, except for CYP2B6. In 
general this should be followed up with further in vitro experiments to determine Kinact and KI to be able to 
evaluate the potential risk for in vivo DDIs. This has not been done and thus it is not known whether there is 
an effect on the exposure of CYP2B6 substrates in vivo.  
Patisiran-LNP did not cause induction of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 and the change compared to positive controls was 
<20% and can therefore be concluded to be negative. For CYP2B6 there was a >2-fold increase of mRNA 
levels compared to vehicle control in all 3 human hepatocyte donors. In general an in vivo DDI study is 
warranted for a positive CYP induction in vitro signal. As ALN-18328 was also shown to be an in vitro time 
dependent CYP2B6 inhibitor and the net effect (TDI and induction) in vivo is not possible to predict from in 
vitro data. A clinical DDI study with a CYP2B6 probe would be needed for understanding of the clinical 
relevance of the in vitro signals.  However, as there are a limited number of substrates metabolised by 
CYP2B6 it is considered acceptable to reflect the in vitro results in the SmPC Section 4.5, i.e. that the net 
effect, if any, on a CYP2B6 substrate co-medicated with Patisiran-LNP in vivo is not known and to include a 
list of examples of relevant CYP2B6 substrates. 
Transthyretin and cytochrome P450s share common transcriptional regulatory pathways (such as Hepatic 
nuclear factors). This could lead to normalizing of CYP levels during the course of Patisiran-LNP 
administration and potentially change the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP enzymes. The 
Applicant has measured cytokine levels in the SAD study (001) as well in the patient study 002. No 
substantial changes were observed in any dose groups for the following cytokines: G-CSF, IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-
1b, and IL-12. Minor transient increases in mean IL-6, IL-1RA, IP-10, and TNF-α level were seen after the 
second dose for some dose groups. Even if this was observed only after one or two doses it indicates that the 
in vivo effect on CYP enzymes is likely limited. 
Commercial Formulation 
The majority of the clinical studies have been performed using development batch of drug product. There 
were very few patients administered the  commercial formulation administered during phase III. Only ca. 18 
patients, that also had plasma data, was administered the commercial formulation in the last 3 doses, i.e. a 
reasonable duration to consider that the plasma concentrations represents the commercial formulation. 
Although, no firm conclusion can be drawn based on PK, the point estimate for the exposure (Ctrough) for 
patients administered the commercial batch is similar to patients receiving the development batch.  
From a pharmaceutical perspective, the similarity of product manufactured with the two different 
manufacturing methods cannot be fully evaluated due to lack on data from the 10 kg batch size with regards 
to release of the drug substance from the nanoparticles. The limited data submitted with regards to in-vitro 
release of the drug substance and bioassay does not indicate any differences in quality between the batches, 
except for a possibly slightly higher stability of the 54 kg batch sizes. 
From a PD perspective, the nadir values of TTR levels were compared. TTR levels were reached at day 10-24 
post dosing, the TTR levels collected during the period 10-24 days post-dose were compared between the 
development and commercial batches. The long-term dosing of patisiran produced very similar mean TTR 
reductions of 77.28% and 75.91% for the development and commercial batches. PD data from 23 patients 
who had only received patisiran from the commercial batch showed a mean TTR reduction of 79.37%, further 
supporting the similar PD effects of the two batches. 
The Applicant has compared the efficacy endpoints for patients who have received only the development 
batch and patients who have switched to the commercial batch. The change from baseline in a number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 68/188 
  
  
endpoints was similar or slightly better for the commercial switch group, indicating that efficacy was 
maintained after switching to this new batch. 
The Applicant has compared the subgroup of patients in studies 004 and 006 receiving only patisiran from 
the development batch (N=174) with the patients initially receiving the development batch, then switched to 
the commercial batch (N=177). The exposure times were different for the two batches: 18.6 months for the 
batch and 9.0 months for the commercial batch, so the incidence rate was chosen for comparison of AEs 
between the batches. The incidences of AEs and SAEs per 100 PYs were comparable between batches. The 
incidence of infusion reactions (21.3% vs 7.9%) and ADA (4.1% vs 0.9%) was higher in the development 
batch than the commercial batch, which is explained by the fact that IRRs occur after the 3 first infusions and 
patients tested positive for ADAs only transiently between day 21 to 126 in the 004 study. In study 006 there 
were 23 patients who had received placebo in the 004 study and only received patisiran from the commercial 
batch in the 006 study. The pattern of AEs and SAEs experienced by this cohort appeared comparable with 
the whole study population. From a clinical safety perspective, the development and commercial batches 
seem comparable. 
Taken all data together the commercial formulation  can be considered to be sufficiently similar to the 
formulation used during development. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The PD effect observed supports that long term dosing with patisiran LNP consistently maintain low TTR 
concentrations at the dose finally chosen.  
The therapeutic hypothesis of patisiran-LNP is that the reduction in serum TTR will lead to a decrease in 
disease-causing amyloid deposits in tissues, which might include some clearance of TTR amyloid deposits 
through lowering of serum TTR. Results from pre-clinical mouse models, other forms of diseases with 
amyloidosis and liver transplanted hATTR patients give some support to the notion that treatment with 
patisiran may induce a reduction (“clearance”) of tissue deposits of TTR. However, the results from skin 
biopsies and LV wall thickness from the patisiran studies do not unanimously show that patisiran induces 
clearance of tissue amyloid deposits (see clinical section: results of exploratory efficacy endpoints and cardiac 
sub-population).  Definite pharmacodynamic results on possible clearance remain to be shown from data 
collected from long-term efficacy follow up in post approval setting. 
Low RBP and vitamin A levels were observed during the clinical development, as expected, as serum TTR is a 
carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP). Therefore the CHMP considered acceptable the recommendation for 
vitamin A supplementation to be included in section 4.2 of the SmPC, and the recommended daily intake of 
2,500 IU (as used during the clinical studies) as a reference daily intake.   
In addition, unbalance in vitamin A levels during the first trimester of the pregnancy may lead to teratogenic 
effects for the foetus; specific recommendations for vitamin A supplementation during an unplanned or 
planned pregnancy have also been included in the SmPC. All these risk minimisation measures were 
considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Patisiran was shown to be an in vitro time dependent CYP2B6 inhibitor and inducer. The net effect (TDI and 
induction) in vivo is not possible to be predicted from in vitro data. In absence of a DDI study with a CYP2B6 
probe and taken into consideration the limited number of substrates metabolized by CYP2B6, it is considered 
acceptable to reflect the in vitro results in the SmPC Section 4.5, i.e. that the net effect, if any, on a CYP2B6 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 69/188 
  
  
substrate co-medicated with Patisiran-LNP in vivo is not known and to refer the prescriber to bupropion and 
efavirenz as as relevant CYP2B6 substrates. 
In relation to the pharmacological effect of Onpattro which leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A (retinol) 
levels, the CHMP considers that the supplementation with 2500 IU vitamin A per day is an appropriate risk 
minimisation measure. 
Overall the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of patisiran have been thoroughly investigated and well 
described. The results generally reflect the expected behaviour of a substance belonging to the chemical class 
of double-stranded oligonucleotides. 
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program of patisiran is based on 6 studies, three smaller studies (study 001, 005, 
study 002) assessing the dose, one clinical pivotal study (study 004) and two open extension clinical studies 
(study 003, study 006) assessing the efficacy and/or safety. 
2.7.1.  Dose response studies 
Two Phase I patisiran-LNP single ascending dose (SAD) studies in healthy volunteers contributed PD 
assessments (eg, TTR levels)(See also PD section and PK).  In addition, Study ALN-TTR02-002 was a Phase 2 
multiple dose ascending (MAD) study that contributed PD (eg, TTR levels, safety) in patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. 
Dose-dependent reductions in serum TTR concentrations were observed in both healthy volunteers, and in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (Study 002).  Sustained TTR reduction between doses 
was consistently achieved with 0.3 mg/kg q3w, where maximum TTR reductions of up to 96% were 
observed.   
The 0.3mg/kg was selected as allowing a reduction of 80% of TTR levels, and the frequency of three-weekly 
leads to a more consistent fall over the treatment period without increase of adverse events over the 4-
weekly frequency. Selection of the patisiran-LNP dose for the Phase 2 open label extension study (Study 003) 
and pivotal Phase 3 study (Study 004) was justified by the applicant based on what was known about 
amyloidogenic protein reduction and clinical benefit in other acquired and hereditary amyloidoses. In light 
chain (AL) amyloidosis, a >50% reduction in serum free light chains in response to chemotherapy was 
associated with a significant improvement in survival (Lachmann et al, 2003). In hereditary ApoA1 
amyloidosis, where both the liver and small intestine contribute to circulating ApoA1 levels, a 50% reduction 
in variant ApoA1 levels following hepatorenal transplantation was shown to favourably alter the natural 
history of the disease (Gillmore et al, 2006). Serial SAP scintigraphy, used to assess visceral amyloid burden, 
has shown a correlation between the extent of serum amyloidogenic protein reduction and change in amyloid 
burden in AL and serum amyloid A protein (AA) amyloidosis (Gillmore et al, 2001; Lachmann et al, 2007; 
Lachmann et al, 2003). According to these publications, reductions of approximately 55-70% were associated 
with stabilization of amyloid deposits, whereas reductions of approximately 80% or greater were associated 
with regression of deposits. This is consistent with the findings in transgenic mice expressing human V30M 
TTR. 
Results of disease and clinical efficacy modelling of Studies 003 and 004 indicated that there was a 
continuous relationship between TTR lowering and decrease in rate of mNIS+7 progression. Simulated 
median TTR reduction of ≥80% was associated with stabilization or improvement in mNIS+7 change from 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 70/188 
  
  
baseline on a population basis. TTR reductions less than 80% were associated with an increase in mNIS+7 
from baseline, although at a much slower rate compared to placebo. 
Study ALN-TTR02-005 (Study 005, Japanese SAD study) (See also clinical PD section and PK) 
Two of 12 subjects had anti-PEG antibodies and displayed reduced PD response measures as illustrated by 
the absence of TTR reduction. However, two subjects showed lower PK exposures explaining the 
corresponding lower PD response. Their doses of patisiran-LNP were low; 0.05 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg, 
respectively, with the 0.15 mg/kg dose being on the steep slope of the dose-response curve with high 
variability. 
Study ALN-TTR02-002 (Study 002, MAD study) (See also clinical PD section and PK) 
Two of 29 healthy subjects exposed to patisiran were anti-PEG positive on at least one time point. Of the 2 
patients, one patient tested positive only once, and the other was repeatedly tested positive for ADA, 
although it diminished and finally disappeared during the extension study 003. The ADA status didn’t affect 
the TTR titres. The data from these patients were compared to the PK and PD data from the overall study 
population with no differences shown.

Treatments 
Patients who were randomized into the active treatment group received 0.3 mg/kg patisiran-LNP q3w diluted 
in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline). Patients who were randomized into the control group 
received placebo (normal saline) q3w. 
The amount (in mg) of study drug to be administered was determined based on the patient's weight (kg). 
The body weight obtained during the previous visit was used to calculate the dose of study drug. Patients 
who weighed ≥105 kg were dosed based on assumption of body weight of 104 kg. 
Study drug (either patisiran-LNP or placebo) was to be administered only through a secure and free-flowing 
venous access line, via a controlled infusion devise with an extension set containing a 1.2 micron filter, over 
approximately 70 minutes at an initial infusion rate of approximately 1 mL/min for the first 15 minutes, then 
increasing to approximately 3 mL/min for the remainder of the infusion. In the event of an IRR, the infusion 
time may have been extended as described below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 73/188 
  
  
 
 
Premedication 
All patients received premedication in order to reduce the potential of an IRR. The original premedication 
regimen, as outlined below, was implemented in the original protocol and in Amendment 1 of the protocol, 
which was instituted prior to any patient receiving treatment in the study. Subsequently, a subset of patients 
in Study ALN-TTR02-003 experienced AEs suspected to be related to steroids (eg, flushing) and were 
transitioned to a reduced premedication regimen, with a reduced dose of corticosteroid to mitigate these 
events. After observing that the subset of patients tolerated the lower corticosteroid dose with no consequent 
increase in IRRs, the protocols for Study ALN-TTR02-003 and ALN-TTR02-004 were amended (Global 
Amendment 6) to transition patients to the reduced premedication regimen described below. 
The original premedication regimen was as follows: 
On the evening prior to study drug administration, all patients received the following premedication: 
•  Oral dexamethasone (8 mg) or equivalent; 
•  Oral paracetamol (500 mg) or equivalent; 
•  Oral H2 blocker (eg, ranitidine 150 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 blocker dose); 
•  Oral H1 blocker, 10 mg cetirizine (hydroxyzine 25 mg, fexofenadine, or equivalent may be 
substituted if patient does not tolerate cetirizine). 
Prior to each dose of study drug, patients also received the following premedication at least 60 minutes prior 
to the infusion: 
• 
Intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg) or equivalent; 
•  Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent; 
• 
Intravenous H2 blocker (eg, ranitidine 150 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other 
•  H2 blocker dose); and 
• 
Intravenous H1 blocker; diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the 
study site). Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg per OS (PO, orally) or cetririzine 10 mg PO may be 
substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker. 
The reduced premedication regimen was as follows: 
There were no premedication given in the evening prior to the infusion. Patients received the following 
premedication on the day of study drug administration at least 60 minutes prior to the infusion: 
• 
Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent; 
•  Oral paracetamol/acetaminophen (500 mg) or equivalent; 
• 
• 
Intravenous H2 blocker (eg, ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other H2 blocker 
dose); 
Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the 
study site). Hydroxyzine or fexofenadine 25 mg (PO, orally) or cetirizine 10 mg PO may be 
substituted for any patient who does not tolerate IV diphenhydramine or other IV H1 blocker.

Management of Infusion Related Reactions 
The patient’s infusion site was assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 
minutes after the end of the infusion. The patient remained at the study site for 1 hour following completion 
of dosing for observation and completion of assessments. Patients were instructed to call the Investigator if 
they experienced symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, or nausea/vomiting after being discharged from 
the site. 
Signs and symptoms of IRRs were defined in the study protocol, and suggested guidelines for IRR 
management were provided including adjustment of the infusion rate or administration of additional 
concomitant medication, including adjustment of steroid dosing. 
The severity of an IRR was categorized as follows depending on the actions taken to manage the IRR: 
Categorization 
Description 
Mild 
Mild reaction:  infusion may be continued; if intervention is indicated  it is 
minimal and additional treatment (other than paracetamol for  delayed 
reactions) is not required. 
Moderate 
Moderate reaction:  requires treatment including more intensive  therapy 
(eg, IV fluids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in  addition to infusion 
interruption but responds promptly to medication.  Treatment is indicated 
for ≤24 hours. 
Severe 
More than moderate reaction:  not rapidly responsive to medication or  to 
interruption of infusion; and/ or prolonged (treatment is indicated  for >24 
hours); recurrence of severe symptoms following initial  improvement. 
Objectives and endpoints 
Primary objective/endpoint 
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of patisiran by evaluating the difference between the 
patisiran and placebo groups in the change from baseline of mNIS+7 score at 18 months. The mNIS+7 is a 
composite assessment that measures a range of motor, sensory, and autonomic neurologic impairment 
experienced by hATTR-PN patients. 
Secondary objectives/endpoints 
The secondary objective was to determine the effect of patisiran on various clinical parameters by assessing 
the difference between patisiran and placebo in the change from baseline in the following measurements at 
18 months (see also more detailed description below under heading “Secondary and exploratory endpoint 
measures): 
•  Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) questionnaire; 
•  Neurological impairment score (NIS)-weakness (NIS-W) score; 
•  Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) score; 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 75/188 
  
  
 
 
• 
Timed 10-meter walk test (10-MWT, gait speed); 
•  Modified body mass index (mBMI); 
•  Autonomic symptoms questionnaire (Composite Autonomic Symptom Score [COMPASS 31]). 
Exploratory objectives/endpoints 
The exploratory objectives of the study were: 
• 
To determine the difference between the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups in the change from 
baseline in the following measurements at 18 months: 
o  NIS+7 score; 
o  Grip strength; 
o  EuroQOL (EQ-5D) questionnaire; 
o 
Large vs small nerve fiber function including nerve conduction studies sum of 5 attributes 
(NCS Σ5), quantitative sensory testing (QST) by body surface area including touch pressure 
(TP) and heat pain (HP), vibration detection threshold (VDT), heart rate variability to deep 
breathing (HRdb), postural blood pressure; 
o  Pathologic evaluation of sensory and autonomic innervation through voluntary skin punch 
biopsies and analysis of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD),sweat gland nerve fiber 
density (SGNFD), and dermal amyloid content; 
o  Assessment of ambulation through FAP stage and Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score; 
o  Cardiac assessment through echocardiogram, troponin I, and N-terminal prohormone of B-
type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels; 
• 
• 
o  Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers [TTR, retinol binding protein (RBP), vitamin A]; 
To compare the proportion of patients in the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups who met the pre-
defined criterion for rapid disease progression (defined as ≥24 point increase in mNIS+7 from 
baseline [based on an average of 2 measurements] and FAP stage progression relative to baseline) at 
9 months. 
To serially evaluate lower limb nerve injury via voluntary magnetic resonance (MR) neurography 
approximately every 6 months in patients receiving either patisiran-LNP or placebo. (This objective 
was added in country-specific amendments for France and Germany) 
Sample size, randomisation and blinding (masking) 
For the primary endpoint, a mean (±SD) mNIS+7 (see description of the variable below) progression rate in 
the placebo group of 24 ± 16 points over 18 months was estimated using natural history data from FAP 
patients. A sample size of 154 (2:1) was expected to yield a power of 90% based on a two-sided significance 
level of 0.05 and an assumption of a 8.95 point (37.5%) mean difference between treatment groups in the 
primary endpoint. Assuming a 25% discontinuation rate the expected total sample size was approximately 
200.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 76/188 
  
  
 
On Visit Day 0 (pre dose) eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either patisiran-
LNP or placebo using IRS/IVRS. The randomisation was stratified by three factors: NIS (5-49 vs 50-130), 
early onset V30M (<50 years of age at onset) vs all other mutations (including late onset V30M), and 
previous tetramer stabilizer use (tafamidis or diflunisal) vs no previous tetramer stabilizer use.  
This was a double-blind study, hence patients and all site personnel, except the pharmacist and the site 
personnel who set-up, dispensed, and prepared the infusion, were to be blinded to the study treatment. The 
procedures planned and steps taken to achieve masking of the treatments seem appropriate and included 
e.g. the use of covered infusion bags and lines since the colour of patisiran-LNP and placebo differed. To 
reduce the likelihood of infusion-related reactions, all patients received pre-medication before each study 
drug infusion. 
Blinded study personnel who performed assessments related to efficacy endpoints were separate from 
personnel who monitored the administration of study drug and the well-being of the patient. The study 
personnel performing assessments related to the efficacy endpoints was also to be blinded to the results of 
any previous assessments. In this study there were two types of study centers. Patient Care Sites (PCS) 
could screen, dose, and manage the well-being of patients and collect safety assessments, but could not 
perform efficacy assessments. Central Assessment Sites (CAS) could perform efficacy assessments and 
perform the same assessments as at a PCS (screen, dose, and manage the well-being of patients). Assessors 
who performed efficacy assessments at a CAS were different from site personnel who monitored the 
administration of study drug during the study and monitored the well-being of the patient during the study.  
For patients who discontinued study drug at 9 months due to rapid disease progression, blinding was to be 
maintained; both patients and Investigators were to remain blinded throughout the study. 
Statistical methods 
The SAP was originally finalised on 31 March 2015 (SAP Version 1). Following regulatory feedback, the SAP 
was updated (SAP Version 2, 31 May 2017). Additional minor changes were incorporated to generate the final 
SAP Version 2.1 dated 23 August 2017, prior to database lock. The changes made to the SAP have been 
accounted for and also justified. However, the date for database lock and study treatment unblinding was not 
found and the applicant was requested to clarify. According to the applicant´s response the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) database was locked on 12 September 2017 followed by unblinding of that database on 12 
September 2017. The overall database lock was completed on 14 September 2017, when all final data was 
available. The response raised concerns in that it was not clear what the differences between the two 
databases were and hence, what final data was not available at the first database lock 12 September. The 
Applicant explained that the first date (12 September 2017) i included the lock of all electronic Case Report 
Form (eCRF) data entered by clinical sites per the study protocol (e.g. demographics, medical history, 
adverse events, concomitant medications, exposure data, disposition data, etc.) and the finalization of all 
third party laboratory data which had not required blinding during the study (e.g. ERG and echocardiogram 
assessments). Following this, Alnylam authorized the unblinding of the study in accordance with Alnylam 
SOPs which then allowed third party providers of blinded laboratory data sources to transmit their final 
unblinded raw data transfers to the CRO on 13 September 2017 and 14 September 2017. The laboratory data 
sources included in this second transfer were considered assessments that even without treatment allocation, 
could lead to unblinding, e.g. retinol binding protein, vitamin A assessments. The Applicant stated that there 
was no impact or changes to the data previously locked on 12 September 2017 and refers to 14 September 
2017 as the overall database lock date.

Overall, the analyses as planned seem appropriate. Formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed on 
the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints with all tests conducted using a 2-sided 0.05 level of 
significance. The primary population for efficacy analysis was a modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population 
including all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of patisiran or placebo. Patients were 
analysed according to randomised treatment.  
Primary endpoint 
The analysis of change from baseline of mNIS+7 score at 18 months, was based on a Mixed-Effects Model 
Repeated Measures (MMRM) model including baseline mNIS+7 score as a continuous covariate and fixed 
effect terms including treatment arm, visit (Month 9 or Month 18), treatment-by-visit interaction, genotype 
(V30M vs. non-V30M), age at hATTR symptom onset (<50; ≥50), region (North America, Western Europe, 
and Rest of World), and previous tetramer stabilizer use (yes vs. no). An unstructured covariance structure 
was used to model the within-subject errors. The Satterthwaite approximation was used to estimate the 
degrees of freedom. The analysis was implemented using SAS PROC MIXED.   
For mNIS+7 two assessments were performed at each visit; each component contributing to the composite 
score was the average of the two assessments. A scoring algorithm, including methods for handling missing 
components of the mNIS+7 was pre-defined. For the primary endpoint, a number of sensitivity analyses were 
planned (see below Table 10). Most of them however relying on the assumption of missing at random (MAR). 
With the preferred estimate being that from the pattern mixture model (PMM), additional analyses were 
requested that were to be performed using a model including the data that were observed after 
discontinuation of study treatment and otherwise based on placebo-based multiple imputations for all missing 
or excluded data (i.e. a ‘jump to reference’, addressing the treatment effect if there is no benefit from 
treatment after treatment discontinuation; or for patients using alternative treatments). The additional 
analyses submitted were however not fully in line with what was requested. Instead of a ‘jump to reference’ 
approach (requested), a ‘copy reference’ approach was used as considered more appropriate by the 
Applicant. New analyses were requested and the Applicant provided the requested PMM J2R analyses based 
on a data set excluding in total 12 patients, 4 from the patisiran-LNP arm and 8 from the placebo arm, who 
had efficacy assessments performed at a site found to be GCP non-compliant (Site 061 in Mallorca).  
In line with the earlier presented PMM ‘copy reference’ analyses (based on the full mITT population), the 
point estimates of the differences between patisiran-LNP and placebo as well as the corresponding 95% CIs 
from the PMM ‘jump to reference’ (J2R) analyses were very similar compared to the primary analysis 
although, as could be expected, implied slightly smaller differences between patisiran-LNP and placebo for 
the mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN endpoints respectively, as well as slightly bigger p-values. The same was 
true comparing the PMM J2R analyses with the newly performed MMRM analyses excluding patients who had 
efficacy assessments performed at Site 061 in Mallorca.

Analyses of each of the component of mNIS+7, including NIS-W, NIS-R, QST, Σ5 NCS, and postural blood 
pressure, were also planned using MMRM models similar to those employed for the primary analysis. Given 
that the primary endpoint was a composite measure, these are considered to be of importance.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using an MMRM model similar to the model described for the 
primary analysis of mNIS+7 while adjusting for baseline value of the endpoint being modeled. The planned 
analyses of the secondary endpoints are summarized in Table 11 below.

Multiplicity 
The approach to handle multiplicity implied that secondary endpoints were tested in a pre-specified hierarchy 
(1 Norfolk QOL-DN questionnaire [Total Score]; 2 NIS-W score; 3 R-ODS; 4 10-meter walk test speed; 5 
mBMI; 6 COMPASS-31 total score) which is acceptable. Only if a comparison was significant at a 2-sided 0.05 
significance level, the next endpoint in the hierarchy was formally tested; if a given comparison was not 
significant at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level, the subsequent tests were performed with nominal p values 
reported. 
Cardiac subpopulation 
The cardiac subpopulation was defined within an amendment to the SAP (SAP V2.0, 31 May 2017) and 
included patients with evidence of pre-existing cardiac amyloid involvement, defined as patients with baseline 
left ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≥1.3 cm and no aortic valve disease or hypertension in medical history. 
For the Cardiac Subpopulation, the change from baseline to Month 18 in LV wall thickness, LV mass, LVEF, LV 
longitudinal strain, NT-proBNP and troponin I were analysed using MMRM (pre-specified analysis). Regarding 
these analyses, the cardiac subpopulation should preferable have been identified already from the start of the 
study with stratification at randomisation for subpopulation eligibility to ensure balance between the 
treatment arms. The analyses performed based on the cardiac subpopulation were however all considered to 
be exploratory.  
Results 
Recruitment and Participant flow 
A total of 323 patients were screened for participation in the study; 225 patients were randomized. 
A total of 225 patients were randomized [148 to the patisiran-LNP group and 77 to the placebo group] Table 
12. All randomized patients were treated with study drug. Patients from 19 countries and 44 study centers 
were randomized and treated. Countries that randomized ≥10 patients were: United States (33 patisiran-
LNP, 9 placebo), France (23 patisiran-LNP, 12 placebo), Taiwan (8 patisiran-LNP, 10 placebo), Spain (7 
patisiran-LNP, 10 placebo), Japan (7 patisiran-LNP, 9 placebo), Germany (13 patisiran-LNP, 2 placebo), 
Mexico (11 patisiran-LNP, 4 placebo), Portugal (6 patisiran-LNP, 4 placebo), and South Korea 
(8 patisiran-LNP, 2 placebo). The participant’s flow is shown in Figure 9 below.

Figure 9 Patient Flow and Disposition Schematic 
Of special note from this figure is that a total of 185 (82.2%) patients completed study treatment, but there 
was a difference between the patisiran and placebo groups, 92.6% vs. 62.3% respectively. The most 
common reason for study treatment discontinuation overall was withdrawal of consent by the patient that 
was lower in the patisiran group compared with the placebo group (1 [0.7%] patisiran-LNP, 12 [15.6%] 
placebo). The reasons provided by patients in the placebo group who withdrew consent included “disease 
progression” or “worsening disease”. The next most common reason for study treatment discontinuation 
overall was AEs and less patients in the patisiran-LNP group discontinued treatment for this reason compared 
with the placebo group (3 [2.0%] patisiran-LNP, 7 [9.1%] placebo). 
Conduct of the study 
The original global protocol was finalized on 15 August 2013; one patient was enrolled under the original 
protocol. There were 5 amendments to the global protocol; a majority of patients enrolled in the study under 
these protocol amendments. Additionally, country-specific amendments were made for Italy, Portugal, 
Taiwan, France, Netherlands, Japan, Brazil, and Germany. In the applicant’s view these changes to the 
conduct of the study did not have any implications on the interpretation of the study results.

c Patients with baseline LV wall thickness ≥ 1.3cm and no medical history of aortic valve disease or hypertension are 
included in the cardiac subpopulation. 
1 (1.3) 
In the overall mITT population, a majority of patients (72.4%) were White or Caucasian, 23.1% were Asian 
and five patients (2.2 %) were Black/African or African American. A majority of patients were from Western 
Europe (43.6%) followed by North America (20.9%) and Asia (19.6%). A total of 39 different TTR mutations 
were represented; 57.3% of patients had a non-V30M genotype and 10.2% of patients had early onset 
V30M. The V30M genotype was most frequent in Portugal (100% of the Portuguese patients), Sweden 
(89%), Spain (82%), France (71%), and Japan (63%). The most common non-V30M genotypes present in 
>5% patients were Ala97Ser (100 % of Taiwanese patients), Thr60Ala (33% of US patients), Glu89Gln (88% 
of Bulgarian patients), and Ser50Arg (89% of Mexican patients). The Val122Ile mutation (found in up to 4% 
of African Americans, with a cardiac-predominant phenotype) was found in 2 patients, 1 from Spain and 1 
from US. 
There is a notable difference between treatment groups of more than 10% regarding some baseline 
demographics/characteristics (Asian or not, V30M or other, cardiac subpopulation yes/no). E.g. a higher 
proportion of patients in the patisiran group compared with the placebo group had a non-V30M genotype 
62.2% vs. 48.1%, respectively. Furthermore 12% more Asian population was recruited in the active group as 
compared to the placebo group which could explain the higher proportion of non-V30M and cardiac 
population with patisiran-LNP. Complementary analyses assessing response rates across subgroups 
(genotype, pre-specified cardiac subpopulation, race) within each arm were provided by the Applicant. They 
do not show heterogeneity of responses in these subgroups within both arms since a consistent clinical 
benefit across these specific subgroups was observed. 
Additionally, the Applicant provided a safety analysis of these specific subgroups targeting the most frequent 
AEs (≥ 3%). Among the 11 AEs identified, no imbalance of incidences were noticed except for oedema 
peripheral for which there was a higher incidence rate in non 30VM and cardiac subgroups compared to their 
counterparts. 
Cardiac Subpopulation 
The pre-specified cardiac subpopulation was included to provide a more sensitive cohort for detection of 
patisiran-LNP treatment effects on cardiomyopathy, which might otherwise be difficult to discern. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 84/188 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 56% of patients were included in the predefined cardiac subpopulation. The proportion of cardiac 
patients was however higher in the patisiran-LNP group than the placebo group; 60.8% (90/148) vs. 46.8% 
(36/77), respectively (see table above). Complementary analyses assessing response rates across 
subgroups, including the cardiac subpopulation within each arm were provided by the Applicant. They do not 
show heterogeneity of responses in these subgroups within both arms since a consistent clinical benefit 
across these specific subgroups was observed. In addition, in new post-hoc analyses assessing cardiac 
endpoints in subpopulations defined using alternate definitions for the cardiac population, no meaningful 
imbalance between the two treatment arms was observed in the number of patients with cardiac 
manifestations of the disease. 
Among patients not included in the cardiac subpopulation, 55.6% had mean LV wall thickness ≥1.3cm, 
indicating potential cardiac amyloid involvement, but were excluded from the predefined cardiac 
subpopulation primarily due to medical history of hypertension. Thus, 80.4% of patients had evidence of 
cardiomyopathy based on left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 1.3 cm at baseline.  
Numbers analysed 
Of the 225 patients randomized and treated, all were included in the mITT and Safety Population (see Table 
13); patients in the patisiran-LNP group were included in the PK Population. 
A total of 203 (90.2%) patients were included in the PP population for efficacy analysis. 
Of the twenty-two patients that were excluded from the PP population, 19 were due to absence of either 
baseline or both 9-month or 18-month mNIS+7 and Norfolk QOL assessments, and 3 were due to major 
protocol deviations impacting efficacy interpretation. A higher percentage of patients in the placebo group 
withdrew from the study prior to the 9-month visit, and were not included in PP population.

Primary outcome measure mNIS+7 
As already mentioned, the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), a composite neurologic 
impairment score, was the primary efficacy variable in the pivotal study 004. Composite neurologic 
impairment scores have been used previously as endpoints in clinical trials for the assessment of neuropathy 
progression. In particular, the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) and NIS+7 (=NIS in addition with seven 
neurophysiological variables) have been used in clinical trials of diabetic polyneuropathy and CIDP (chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). These scores have been adopted in clinical studies of hATTR 
amyloidosis.  NIS has been shown to correlate with disease stage and quality of life thereby supporting the 
clinical relevance of the NIS score in hATTR amyloidosis. NIS +7 has been validated in diabetic 
polyneuropathy and has been used in a Phase 3 trial in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. 
The modified NIS+7 (mNIS+7) was developed specifically for monitoring progression of neurologic 
impairment in hATTR amyloidosis patients. The modifications address the limitations of the NIS+7 for the 
hATTR amyloidosis patient population and increase the sensitivity and dynamic range of the composite score 
in order to better measure progression of neurologic impairment in a heterogeneous group of patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis. The different components of the mNIS+7 used in the patisiran trials are shown in Table 
below.

Results of mNIS+7 in pivotal study 004 
The global outcome measured in mNIS+7 at 18 months is shown in the table below. Improvement (change in 
mNIS+7 score <0) was seen in approximately half (56.1%) of patisiran-LNP treated patients at 18 months, 
compared to 4% in the placebo group. Relative to baseline, the patisiran-LNP group had a score decrease at

18 months (LS mean change from baseline: -6.03 points). In contrast, the placebo group had an increase of 
score indicating worsening of underlying neuropathy at 18 months relative (LS mean change from baseline: 
+27.96 points). The change in mNIS+7 over time is seen in Table 16 and in Figure 10 below.

As already noted the dropout rate in the placebo group was higher than in the patisiran-LNP group, and the 
reasons provided for withdrawal of consent in a majority of patients in the placebo group was “worsening of 
disease” or “disease progression”. Comparing dropouts vs completers within each group, the mNIS+7 median

change at Month 9 (based on last observation carried forward [LOCF]) was 28 vs 12 points for the placebo 
group, and -3.5 vs 0.5 points for the patisiran-LNP group, respectively. This suggests that placebo dropouts 
generally had a worse outcome compared with completers, while some patisiran-LNP dropouts derived 
benefit from treatment before withdrawal. All sensitivity analyses resulted in a consistent estimate of a 
positive treatment effect of patisiran-LNP compared to placebo on mNIS+7.

A total of 27 patients on patisiran-LNP (18.2%) and 40 patients on placebo (51.9%) had an increase of 
mNIS+7 of 10 points or more. An supplementary analysis by the applicant of characteristics of patients on 
patisiran- LNP with an increase of mNIS+7 ≥ 10 points at 18 months identified no baseline demographics or 
patient characteristics that would lead to absence of treatment effect with patisiran-LNP. Furthermore, the 
applicant points out, in patients with an increase in mNIS+7 of ≥10 points on patisiran-LNP there was a 
difference in neuropathy (mNIS+7) and clinical benefit across multiple health measures compared to placebo 
patients, favouring patisiran-LNP.

mNIS+7 component analysis  
Table 18 and Figures 11 and 12 below show the change from baseline to month 18 for the five different 
components of mNIS+7. Figure part a) shows actual numbers (mean, 95% confidence interval) and part b) 
shows standardised effect analysis which facilitates comparison between the different components.  
Relative to baseline, all component scores worsened in placebo patients. Patients in the patisiran-LNP group 
showed an improvement relative to baseline in QST (-6.0 points) and postural blood pressure (-0.2 points); 
other components were stable.

Figure 12 (b) mNIS+7 components standardized effect analysis 
mNIS+7 is a composite score with five main parts. Motor skills are clearly dominating while autonomic 
function only contributes less than 1% of the total score. The electrophysiological tests may be less 
subjective, but don't add any new information than clinical motor examination and QST of touch pressure. 
Reflexes decline with increasing sensory and /or motor affection and do not represent any other specific 
function. Thus large myelinated nerve fibres are assessed several times which will amplify or reduce the total 
score. What appears as an improvement from baseline of mNIS+7 in the patisiran treated patients is 
completely dependent on the score change in QST component (see Figure 13 below).

There is a great variability in QST reliability. Other data than QST on sensory nerves and their function (nerve 
density in skin biopsies, SNAP data as presented by the applicant) as well as QoL assessments by the 
patients are not consistent with improvement in sensory function and symptoms. However, it is agreed that 
all 5 components of the mNIS+7 scales showed significant treatment effects compared to placebo. 
The mNIS+7 composite has not been used in clinical trials before and weighting is different for each 
component with NIS-W and QST driving the total scoring. 
A Consensus report of the Peripheral Nerve Society suggested that a clinically significant change in 
neurological impairment as assessed by NIS score (a related predecessor of the mNIS+7) would be the 
degree of change that is twice (for the 2 sides of the body) the least degree of neurological impairment 
change that can be recognized on physical exam by an examining physician. In the case of change of muscle 
strength, strength of one muscle group on one side of the body is graded as normal (0 points) 25% weak (1 
point), 50% weak (2 points), 75% weak (3 points) and paralyzed (4 points). A change of 25% of one muscle 
group times two body sides would be a change of 2 points. The Peripheral Nerve Society concluded that a 2-
point change in NIS (scale range 0-244 points) would be the minimal clinically meaningful difference, as it 
reflects a detectable difference in muscle strength. Prior hATTR amyloidosis phase 3 trials (tafamidis and 
diflunisal) have used 2-point threshold for NIS-LL and NIS+7 scores therefore the CHMP considered 
appropriate that a threshold of 2 points could be applied to mNIS+7. A side-by-side alignment of NIS, NIS-
LL, NIS+7 and mNIS+7 is presented in Figure 14 below. NIS, NIS+7 and mNIS+7 use the same NIS-W 
component which is the largest component of all the scales.

The baseline and change from baseline at 18 months for the 5 neurophysiological variables were examined 
by the applicant. The 5 neurophysiological variables include: ulnar CMAP, ulnar SNAP, sural SNAP, tibial 
CMAP, and peroneal CMAP. The results show baseline values for neurophysiological variables were generally 
similar in the placebo and patisiran-LNP groups.  
mNIS+7 Subgroup Analysis 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics 
A consistent treatment effect of patisiran-LNP on mNIS+7 was observed across all subgroups demonstrating 
reduced rate of neuropathy deterioration compared to placebo across a broad range of demographic and 
baseline disease characteristics. Subgroups evaluated included the following: age (<65; ≥65), gender, race 
(white, non-white), region (North America, Western Europe, Rest of World), NIS (< 50; ≥ 50), genotype 
(V30M; non-V30M), genotype class (Early onset V30M; Other), previous tetramer use, FAP stage (I; II & III) 
and cardiac subpopulation, see Figure 15 below. 
Figure 15 Change from baseline in mNIS+7 compared to placebo by baseline demographic and 
disease subgroups 
The observed least improvement on the primary endpoint seen for early onset V30M as noted in the figure 
above could be a chance finding as early onset V30M is a very small subgroup. Also, the relatively lower 
baseline mNIS+7 score in the early onset placebo patients could potentially lead to the smaller magnitude of 
mNIS+7 progression compared with all other mutation patients (LS mean change 14.0 versus 31.5 points), 
which results in the numerical difference in treatment effects on the absolute change scale. Although a 
numerical difference is observed on the absolute change scale, the treatment difference on the percentage 
change scale appears to be similar for the two subgroups early onset V30M compared to all other mutation.

Since randomization was not stratified by region, some imbalance in prognostic factors between the two 
treatment groups in each region may occur, as exemplified by that the variation between North America and 
rest of the world was at least 20%. Also, the sample sizes per region are relatively small which can lead to 
some uncertainty with estimates of treatment effect. The applicant also points out that the North America 
and rest of the world regions demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment effects 
with patisiran compared with placebo. 
The age by categories included patients <65 years which represents nearly 60% of the overall included 
patients. A more precise repartition of patients, <50 years and between 50 and 65 year has been provided, 
at the CHMP request, and analysed for the primary and secondary endpoints. The analyses provided show 
consistent treatment effect across class of age (<50, ≥50 – 65, ≥65) for the primary endpoint and the 6 
secondary endpoint explored. There is no observed significant impact of these 3 age brackets on the 
treatment outcome regarding the considered endpoints. 
The Applicant has provided Boxplots of mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN change at Month 18 by region, by 
country, and by study center. The number of patients recruited per center varied between 1 and 22. These 
Boxplots demonstrate consistent treatment effect across different regions, countries, and study centers. 
Change from baseline in mNIS+7 compared to placebo for the baseline demographic and disease 
characteristics subgroups, shows a consistent difference in favour of patisiran, see table below. 
The mNIS+7 values at baseline and change from baseline to Month 18 for the mITT population are presented 
for age, sex, race, region, NIS at baseline, genotype, genotype class, previous tetramer use, and FAP stage 
at baseline. It is agreed with the applicant that the data indicate a consistent and robust effect of patisiran-
LNP on neuropathy impairment across all evaluated subgroups.

Baseline neuropathy severity (NIS) 
The effect of patisiran-LNP was further evaluated across quartiles of baseline neuropathy severity as assessed 
by baseline NIS. Within each quartile, the placebo patients had a worsening of neuropathy score while the 
patisiran-LNP patients had a numerical improvement of neuropathy score, see Figure 16 below.

Genotype 
The effect of patisiran-LNP was further evaluated across different genotypes. Change in mNIS+7 at 18 
months with patisiran-LNP compared to placebo was evaluated for TTR genotypes with at least 10 patients. 
The genotypes included: V30M, Thr-60Ala, Ser-50-Arg, Glu-89-Gln and Ala-97-Ser and the result is shown in 
Figure 17 below.

Figure 17 Boxplots of mNIS+7 change from baseline to month 18 in the five most common 
genotypes studied 
Note: All data are presented including assessments post alternative FAP treatment 
Boxplots of mNIS+7 change from baseline in the five most common genotypes included in the study show 
some variability for the placebo groups, possibly indicating different phenotypes with different progression 
speed. Four of the patisiran genotype groups show slight numerical decrease in mNIS+7 but one group, 
A97S, shows increase (worsening) in mNIS+7. As explained by the applicant, with respect to the Ala97Ser 
mutation, the total number of patients included with this mutation in study 004 was only 21, of which only 17 
contributed with results. The Ala97Ser mutation is the only group with a patisiran mNIS+7 result >0, but the 
change in mNIS+7 in these patients is within the range of mNIS+7 change seen in the overall group of 
patients treated with patisiran. The change from baseline in mNIS+7 for all patients, individual genotypes 
with at least 10 patients, and all other non-V30M genotypes are shown as boxplots in Figure below.

Note: All data are presented including assessments post alternative FAP treatment 
As shown in Figures 17 and 18 above, patisiran-LNP led to a consistent difference to placebo in neuropathy 
across all 6 TTR mutation subgroups. Based on the mechanism of action patisiran-LNP targeting the 3’ UTR of 
TTR mRNA, consistent TTR reduction across a broad range of genotypes in Study 004, and consistent 
improvement mNIS+7 across a broad range of genotypes in Study 004, the applicant argue that the benefit 
in neuropathy can be extrapolated to all genotypes including those not evaluated in study 004. 
The applicant has presented the frequencies of various genotypes in study 004 compared to published 
frequencies in various European countries, confirming that the genotype frequencies in study 004 were 
representative for Europe. 
Secondary and exploratory endpoint measures 
To control overall type I error, these secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical order, in the order 
listed below. 
Norfolk QoL-DN Domains 
The Norfolk QoL-DN is a nerve fiber specific QoL tool that was developed for patients with diabetic 
neuropathy. In an observational cross-sectional natural history study it was demonstrated that the Norfolk 
QoL-DN is reliable and valid in assessing quality of life in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The Norfolk-QoL-
DN uses 35 scored questions across five domains that comprise the total score. The total score ranges from -
4 (best possible quality of life) to 136 points (worst possible quality of life). The domains measure quality of 
life pertinent to all aspects of polyneuropathy in hATTR amyloidosis, including large and small nerve fiber 
function, autonomic function, symptoms, and activities of daily living.  
At baseline, the mean Norfolk QoL-DN was 55.5 points in the placebo group and 59.6 points in the patisiran-
LNP group.  There was a statistically significant difference in quality of life as assessed by Norfolk QoL-DN at 
18 months favouring the patisiran-LNP group compared to placebo (LS mean patisiran -6.7, LS mean placebo 
14.4, LS mean difference between groups: -21.3 points, P=1.103 ×10-10 ). The difference in quality of life 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018

between treatment arms was observed already at 9 months (LS mean difference between groups:  -15.0 
points, 95% CI:  -19.8, -10.2). The cumulative distribution of Norfolk QoL change from baseline at Month 18 
is shown in Figure 19 below.

Population) 
Norfolk QoL-DN Subgroup Analysis 
Subgroup analysis for Norfolk QoL-DN included analysis by baseline demographic and disease characteristics, 
and by the most frequent TTR genotypes as described below. 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics 
A consistent treatment effect of patisiran-LNP on Norfolk QoL-DN was observed across all subgroups, as 
demonstrated by a difference favouring patisiran-LNP compared to placebo in quality of life across a broad 
range of demographic and baseline disease characteristics (as shown in Figure 20 below).  Subgroups 
evaluated included the following: age (<65; ≥65), gender, race (white, non-white), region (North America, 
Western Europe, Rest of World), NIS (< 50; ≥ 50), genotype (V30M; non-V30M), genotype class (Early onset 
V30M; Other), previous tetramer use, FAP stage (I; II & III) and cardiac subpopulation.

Impairment Score; V30M=valine to methionine mutation 
Particularly with V30M early onset, there was a large dispersion in results, particularly on Norfolk QoL-DN. As 
explained by the applicant and based on literature there seems to be no evidence for the existence of triplet 
nucleotide expansion in the TTR gene itself nor in neighbouring regions despite efforts to identify such 
regions in patients with V30M (Soares, 1999, Soares, 2004). Since DNA samples were not collected, the 
analysis on trinucleotide repeats in the APOLLO patients cannot be conducted. 
Genotype 
Change in Norfolk QoL-DN at 18 months with patisiran-LNP compared to placebo was evaluated for TTR 
genotypes with at least 10 patients: V30M, Thr-60Ala, Ser-50-Arg, Glu-89-Gln and Ala-97-Ser. As shown in 
Figure 21 below, differences in quality of life favouring patisiran-LNP compared to placebo were noted across 
all 5 genotypes.

Patients with V30M mutation treated with patisiran in study 004 is the only subgroup that show a trend of 
improvement for the QoL score from baseline. The change from baseline in mNIS+7 for all patients, 
individual genotypes with at least 10 patients, and all other non-V30M genotypes are shown as boxplots in

Note: All data are presented including assessments post alternative FAP treatment 
As shown in the figure above, in the V30M and other non-V30M genotype groups, which represented 72% of 
the whole study population, there was a trend for improvement of Norfolk QoL relative to baseline, whereas 
for the other most common genotypes (Al97Ser, Glu89Gln, Ser50Arg, Thr60Ala) didn’t show any 
improvement of Norfolk QoL relative to baseline, but only relative to placebo. The variability of the results for 
various genotypes was probably related to the small number of patients represented in these individual 
mutations in the setting of a large dispersion of interpatient results.

Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale, R-ODS, is a patient-reported disability scale that captures activity and 
social participation limitations. 
The 10-MWT measures the time it takes a patient to walk a distance of 10 meters. In performing this test, 
patients were allowed to use ambulatory aids such as a cane or walker. 
Gait speed is commonly studied in patients with neuropathy and is anticipated to be associated primarily with 
muscle strength but also with sensation. The mean self-selected gait speed in healthy subjects ages 10 to 79 
years ranged from approximately 1.1 to 1.3 m/s. A walking speed of 1.4 m/s is considered to represent an 
“extremely fit” individual whereas a walking speed of <0.8m/s suggests a patient with more limited 
community ambulation. 
mBMI is a measure of nutritional status calculated as the product of BMI (weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of height in meters) and serum albumin (g/L). Patients with hATTR amyloidosis often have poor 
nutritional status and overall weight loss due in part to severe gastrointestinal manifestations and in part due 
to cardiac disease.

The COMPASS 31 has been used to assess autonomic symptoms in patients with diabetic neuropathy and 
small fiber polyneuropathy and is considered a valid instrument in these patients. Patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis often have debilitating autonomic dysfunction, COMPASS 31 was adopted for use in patisiran-LNP 
clinical studies. 
Cumulative distribution curves of change from baseline at 18 months in all additional secondary endpoints 
shows separation between patisiran-LNP and placebo treated patients, favouring patisiran-LNP, across all 
response thresholds (Figure 23).

Relative to baseline, the patisiran-LNP group showed stabilization or improvement of motor strength, R-ODS, 
gait speed and COMPASS 31, in contrast the placebo group showed a worsening (for COMPASS only 
numerical) in these secondary end-points. 
Relative to baseline, the patisiran-LNP group showed a limited numerical decrease from baseline in mBMI, in 
contrast the placebo group showed a significant decrease in mBMI at 18 months. 
Patisiran-LNP appears to reduce the frequency and severity of diarrhea symptoms based on COMPASS 31 
results. In addition, Patisiran-LNP reduces patient reported symptoms of moderate or severe diarrhoea 
and/or loss of bowel control based on Norfolk QoL-DN results.

Study 004: Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
NIS+7 score, Grip strength, EuroQOL (EQ-5D) questionnaire, Large vs small nerve fiber function including 
nerve conduction studies sum of 5 attributes (NCS Σ5) (quantitative sensory testing (QST) by body surface 
area including touch pressure (TP) and heat pain (HP), vibration detection threshold (VDT), heart rate 
variability to deep breathing (HRdb), postural blood pressure), assessment of ambulation through FAP stage 
and Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score and some additional exploratory endpoints were measured. 
Relative to baseline, patisiran-LNP treatment generally either improved or stabilized for these measures 
whereas patients in the placebo group showed worsening at 18 months. 
As can be seen in the figures below patients in the patisiran-LNP group were more likely to have stable or 
improved PND score and FAP Stage at 18 months compared with placebo patients.  Conversely, patients in 
the placebo group were more likely to have progression or worsening in PND score and FAP Stage (Figure 25 
and Figure 26 below). PND score and FAP stage are used clinically to characterize a patient’s baseline 
neuropathy severity and changes in stage and score are reflective of changes in disease severity and ability 
to ambulate without assistance (Adams, 2015).

content were performed in a very limited number of patients. For intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD), 
a difference favouring patisiran-LNP patients compared to placebo was noted at 18 months, but also the 
patisiran-LNP patients had less nerve fiber density. For sweat gland nerve fiber density (SGNFD), and dermal 
amyloid content no difference between patisiran-LNP patients and placebo were noted, there were generally 
no change from baseline.  
Pharmacodynamic exploratory biomarkers [TTR, retinol binding protein (RBP), vitamin A] were included, and 
the results showed an expected substantial reduction in these PD markers.  
Cardiac assessment 
Cardiac assessment through echocardiogram, troponin I, and N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were included as exploratory end-points. The analysis of the effect of patisiran-
LNP on amyloid cardiomyopathy was focused on a pre-specified cardiac subpopulation (LV wall thickness 
≥1.3 cm with no history of aortic valve disease or hypertension), which comprised 56% of the overall study 
population. Among patients in the cardiac subpopulation, 73.0% had non-V30M genotype.  The majority 
(60.3%) had NYHA class II heart failure. 
The analyses focused on echocardiographic parameters indicative of cardiac structure (mean LV wall 
thickness and LV mass) and systolic and diastolic cardiac function (longitudinal strain, left ventricular ejection 
fraction [LVEF], and Left ventricular end-diastolic volume [LVEDV]) and the cardiac biomarker NT pro-BNP; 
all assessed at baseline, Month 9, and Month 18. 
Table 21 Results for Select Echocardiographic Parameters in Study 004 (Cardia Subpopulation) 
A post hoc analysis on the percentage of patients with > than 2 mm, or < 2 mm or in between change in left 
ventricular wall thickness and the proportion of patients that achieved an improvement of > absolute 2% for 
longitudinal strain was performed.

Page 112/188 
  
  
 
 
These thresholds were chosen to be greater than the values suggested as being predicative of outcomes 
based on published data (Quarta 2014).In the cardiac subpopulation, a greater proportion of evaluable (non-
missing data at baseline and Month 18) patients in the patisiran-LNP group had a decrease in mean LV wall 
thickness >2 mm compared to placebo (29.1 % vs 4% respectively) and a greater proportion of patients in 
the patisiran-LNP group had an absolute improvement in longitudinal strain of >2% compared to placebo 
(21.3% vs. 8% respectively). 
NT-proBNP  
In the cardiac subpopulation, at baseline, geometric mean NT-proBNP levels were 726.92 and 711.10 ng/L in 
the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups, respectively. At month 18, geometric mean NT-proBNP decreased to 
544.06 ng/L in the patisiran-LNP group and increased to 1116.75 ng/L in the placebo group. Cumulative 
distribution curves demonstrate that the decrease in NT-proBNP compared to placebo was observed, at both 
9 and 18 months, across all response thresholds (Figure 27). 
Figure 27 Study 004: Cumulative Distribution Function of Change from baseline in Log-
transformed NT-proBNP (ng/L) by Visit (Cardiac Subpopulation) 
Abbreviations:  NT-proBNP= B-type natriuretic peptide 
Data on the relationship between NT-proBNP response to intervention and mortality outcomes in AL 
amyloidosis is available from 5 independent studies (Merlini 2016), (Palladini 2012), (Palladini 2010), 
(Palladini 2006), (Kastritis 2010), (Kastritis 2015). Data from one of these studies indicate that in patients 
with a baseline NT-proBNP > 650 ng/L, changes in NT-proBNP of >30% and >300 ng/L in response to 
interventions are predictive of mortality outcomes (Merlini 2016). 
In the 004 Study, in the cardiac subpopulation, approximately one third of evaluable patients (baseline NT-
proBNP ≥650 ng/L and non-missing 18 month data) on the patisiran-LNP arm demonstrated a decrease from 
baseline in NT-proBNP of >30% and >300 ng/L compared to 0% in the placebo arm.

All patients provided ADA test results in the study, either at baseline or post baseline.  Overall, 8 patients 
tested positive for ADA at any time (pre and/or post-treatment), 6 (4.1%) in the patisiran-LNP treatment 
group and 2 (2.6%) in the placebo group. There was no obvious impact of ADA on TTR reduction in the 6 
patients in the patisiran-LNP group who tested positive for ADA compared to patients with negative ADA 
status (Figure 28).

There was also no impact of ADA on change from baseline in mNIS+7 according to the results presented in 
table 23. Only 6 patients out of 148 were ADA positive in study 004. The effects on mNIS+7 were similar 
between ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients, keeping in mind that the low number of patients with ADA 
(N=6) yielded a high variability.

The ALN-TTR02-004 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) database was locked on 
12 September 2017. This milestone included the lock of all electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF) data entered by clinical sites per the study protocol (e.g. 
demographics, medical history, adverse events, concomitant medications, 
exposure data, disposition data, etc.) and the finalization of all third party 
laboratory data which had not required blinding during the study (e.g. ERG 
and echocardiogram assessments).   
Following the EDC lock on 12 September 2017, Alnylam authorized the 
unblinding of the study in accordance with Alnylam SOPs. This unblinding 
authorization allowed third party providers of blinded laboratory data sources 
to transmit their final unblinded raw data transfers to the CRO on 13 
September 2017 and 14 September 2017. The laboratory data sources 
included in this second transfer were considered assessments that even 
without treatment allocation, could lead to unblinding, e.g. retinol binding 
protein, vitamin A assessments. The CRO integrated the final unblinded raw 
lab data into the study datasets on 14 September 2017. There was no impact 
or changes to the data previously locked on 12 September 2017.

Study 003 
Study 003 was a multinational, multicenter, Phase 2, open-label, extension study designed to provide long 
term (up to 2 years) patisiran-LNP dosing to patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy who 
received and tolerated patisiran-LNP in Study 002. Patients could continue treatment in Study 006 after 
completion of this study. All efficacy summaries were descriptive and no hypothesis testing was performed.

A total of 27 patients were enrolled and treated in Study 003. Twenty-five patients completed the study. 
Patients were enrolled from 7 countries. The mean age at screening was 57.9 years, and 66.7% of patients 
were male. All patients were Caucasian. Almost three quarters (74.1%) of patients had the V30M mutation. 
Patients in this study were allowed concomitant use of TTR tetramer stabilizers. A significant proportion of 
patients (N=11, 40.7%) were in the predefined cardiac subpopulation. The mean total duration of study drug 
exposure was 24.7 months (range 19-25 months).  
Study 003 Primary efficacy endpoint mNIS+7 
The mean mNIS+7 score at baseline was 53.02 points with a range from 2.0-122.5 points (possible range 0-
maximum score of 304). Following administration of patisiran-LNP, the mean (SEM) change from baseline in 
the mNIS+7 at 24 months was -6.95 (2.03) points. mNIS+7 change at different time points is shown in 
Table 25 below. The decrease of the score is mainly due to a reduction in the QST score (-6.00 by 24 
months). 
Table 25 Study 003 Change from baseline in mNIS+7 over time by 6 months intervals, full 
analysis set 
The mean (SEM) change from baseline in mNIS+7 at 24 months was similar between the following subgroups 
of patients who received patisiran-LNP: 
•  With or without a concomitant TTR stabilizer [-7.03 (2.11) vs. -6.75 (5.24), respectively],  
•  Age <65 years old or ≥65 years old [-5.12 (2.25) vs. -9.09 (3.55), respectively]  
•  Male or female patients [-7.31 (1.97) vs. –6.16 (5.16), respectively]  
• 
In the predefined cardiac subpopulation, the mean (SEM) change from baseline in mNIS+7 at 24 
months -9.98 (3.29) was similar to that in the non-cardiac subpopulation -4.73 (2.50). 
Study 003: Additional Efficacy Endpoints  
Overall, NIS and NIS+7, measures of disability (R-ODS), gait speed (10-MWT), nutritional status (mBMI), 
autonomic function (COMPASS 31), motor strength (grip strength), and QoL (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS) were 
stable over the 24 month treatment period (Table 26).

The mean (SD) dermal amyloid burden at baseline was 10.91% (9.49%) and 15.78% (14.93%)  for distal 
thigh and distal leg, respectively, and the mean absolute (SEM) change from baseline to 24 months (Week 
110) was -3.81% (1.31%) for distal thigh and -6.38% (2.81%) for distal leg that reached nominal statistical 
significance. 
Overall, IENFD was stable throughout the 2-year treatment period; SGNFD in both distal thigh and distal leg 
increased over time relative to baseline. 
Study 003 Measures of Cardiac Manifestations in Cardiac Subgroup 
Echocardiogram measures (LV mass, LV wall thickness, longitudinal strain and LVEF) and cardiac biomarkers 
(NT-proBNP and troponin I) performed in the predefined cardiac subgroup were stable over time (Table 27).

ADA was detected in one patient. This patient tested positive for ADA at baseline (titer 1:80) and up to Week 
13 (maximum titer 1:80) following which ADA tested negative.  Baseline ADA positivity in this patient was 
likely due to previous exposure to patisiran-LNP in the parent Study 002.  There was no observed impact of 
ADA on PK of ALN-18328 or TTR reduction. 
Study 006 
Study 006 is an ongoing multicentre, multinational, open-label extension study.  Eligible patients who 
completed either of the two parent Studies, 003 or 004, were given the option to participate in this study.   
At the time of the interim Study 006 data cut-off date (14 July 2017), Study 003 was completed and all 25 
patients who completed Study 003 had enrolled in Study 006.  Study 004 was ongoing; 163 of the 169 
patients who completed Study 004 by that time had enrolled in Study 006. Patients from Study 004 remained 
blinded to Study 004 treatment assignment during participation in Study 006 at the time of the interim data 
cut. Efficacy assessment is presented for the smaller subset of approximately 64 patients who had efficacy 
assessment at Week 52. 
Overall, the mean age at baseline was 61.3 years, 73.9% were male, 79.3% were Caucasian/White. 46.3% 
of patients had V30M mutations, and 53.7% of patients had non V30M mutations that included 30 different 
mutations.

A total of 184 patients were dosed with patisiran-LNP in this study for a mean (SD) of 9 (5.976) months 
(range 0.7 to 24.6 months).   
Study 006: Efficacy Endpoint mNIS+7 
Of the 184 patients who had been treated in this study at the time of the interim data cut, Week 52 mNIS+7 
efficacy data were available for 64 patients (n=10 from 004 placebo, n=30 from 004 patisiran-LNP, and n=24 
from 003 patisiran-LNP). The results are shown in Table 29 below.

Mean (SD) Norfolk QOL-DN at baseline were 73.5 (27.69) and 56.0 (30.87) points in the 004 placebo and 
004 patisiran-LNP groups, respectively.  At Week 52, mean change from baseline Norfolk QOL-DN was -10.2 
points in the 004 placebo and -1.8 points in the 004 patisiran-LNP groups. Only 1 patient from the 003-
patisiran-LNP group performed a Norfolk-QOL-DN assessment at baseline (not required in study 003), 
therefore the change over time cannot be evaluated.

quality of life (EQ-5D) and overall health (EQ-VAS) were generally stable or improved at Week 52 relative to 
Study 006 baseline.  
Study 006: Cardiac Manifestations 
All patients enrolled in Study 006 are included in the analysis of cardiac assessments regardless of whether 
they met the cardiac subpopulation criteria in the parent study.  
At Week 52, echocardiogram results were available for only 9 patients in 004 placebo group, 27 patients (23 
patient for LV ejection fraction) in the 004 patisiran-LNP group and 24 patients in the 003 patisiran-LNP 
group. Among the group of patients from the 004 placebo group with Week 52 assessments, there was 
evidence of stabilization of cardiac structure and function relative to baseline following transitioning to 
patisiran-LNP on Study 006 according to the applicant. In patients from the 004 patisiran-LNP and 003 
patisiran-LNP groups who received treatment with patisiran-LNP on the parent studies, continued treatment 
with patisiran-LNP in Study 006 resulted in maintenance of efficacy according to the applicant.    
At Week 52, median change from baseline in NT-proBNP levels were -12.01 ng/L in the 004 placebo, -15.01 
ng/L in 004 patisiran-LNP, and 3.93 ng/L in the 003 patisiran-LNP group. 
Overall, there were no notable changes in serum Troponin I levels over 52 weeks in any study group.   
Study 006: Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) Impact on Efficacy 
None of the patients tested positive for ADA up to the interim analysis time point. 
2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study 004 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study designed to demonstrate the 
efficacy and safety of patisiran-LNP in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and the used 
design is overall adequate when focusing on the neuropathic manifestations of the disease. The study 
population was limited to subjects with Karnofsky performance status of ≥60 and Polyneuropathy Disability 
(PND) Scores of 0-IIIB hATTR disease with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), i.e had at least mild polyneuropathy 
at baseline and were ambulant. Study 004 population included subjects with different TTR mutations and 
patients with some cardiac involvement, but excluded subjects with severe cardiac involvement. Patisiran-
LNP was administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg q3w as an IV infusion based on phase 1-2 study data. The dose 
selection and the administration schedule is supported by the phase 1-2 data.  
The Applicant justified that the study did not use the already approved tafamidis (which is indicated for the 
treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy) as an 
active comparator because the target population for patisiran differs from the population for which tafamidis 
is approved and moreover it is not universally part of standard of care. The CHMP agreed with the 
justifications and considered that it was acceptable not to include tafamidis as a comparator arm. 
The primary efficacy variable selected was the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7). It is a 
composite neurologic impairment score that was developed specifically for monitoring progression of 
neurologic impairment in hATTR amyloidosis patients, and was considered acceptable, even though not 
formally validated. The clinical relevance of the mNIS+7 is supported by the use of the Neuropathy 
Impairment Score (NIS) and NIS+7 (=NIS in addition with seven neurophysiological variables) which have 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 126/188 
  
  
been used in clinical trials of diabetic polyneuropathy and CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy). NIS has been shown to correlate with disease stage and quality of life thereby supporting 
the clinical relevance of the NIS score in hATTR amyloidosis. NIS +7 has been validated in diabetic 
polyneuropathy and has been used in a Phase 3 trial in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. 
Also the secondary endpoints capturing QoL(R-ODS), walking speed (10-MWT), mBMI, autonomic dysfunction 
(COMPASS-31) were considered adequate and clinical relevant. Exploratory efficacy variables for e.g. serum 
TTR concentration and cardiac function were also evaluated in the study. 
Overall, the analyses as planned were considered appropriate. 
A total of 56% of patients were included in the predefined cardiac subpopulation. The proportion of patients 
was however higher in the patisiran-LNP group than in the placebo group; 60.8% (90/148) vs. 46.8% 
(36/77), respectively. Complementary analyses assessing response rates across subgroups within each arm 
were provided. They do not show heterogeneity of responses in these subgroups within both arms since a 
consistent clinical benefit across these specific subgroups was observed. 
Additionally, the MAH provided a safety analysis of these specific subgroups targeting the most frequent AEs 
(≥ 3%). Among the 11 AEs identified, no imbalance of incidences were noticed except for oedema peripheral 
for which there was a higher incidence rate in non 30VM and cardiac subgroups compared to their 
counterparts. However, at the planning stage, focus was seemingly on neuropathy progression alone and the 
analyses performed based on the cardiac subpopulation were all considered to be exploratory. Among 
patients in the cardiac subpopulation, 73.0% had non-V30M genotype; 68/90 (75.6%) on patisiran and 
24/36 (66.7%) on placebo. The majority (60.3%) had NYHA class II heart failure, also fairly well balanced 
between the treatment groups (56/90 (62.2%); patisiran, 20/36 (55.6%); placebo) and, medical history of 
terms mapping to the cardiac disorders system organ class including terms related to heart failure, cardiac 
conduction disorders and arrhythmias were commonly reported. Looking at cardiac disorders overall; there 
was an imbalance between placebo and patisiran with 58.9% (53/90) and 75.0% (27/36) in the patisiran and 
placebo treated patients respectively. 
Among patients not included in the cardiac subpopulation, 55.6% had mean LV wall thickness ≥1.3cm, 
indicating potential cardiac amyloid involvement, but were excluded from the predefined cardiac 
subpopulation primarily due to medical history of hypertension. Thus, 80.4% of patients had evidence of 
cardiomyopathy based on LV wall thickness ≥ 1.3 cm at baseline. Based on that the cardiac subpopulation 
were considered to likely under-represent cardiac amyloid involvement in the study, key analyses were also 
performed for the mITT population (all randomised). The relevance of the analyses based on the cardiac 
subpopulation could hence be questioned and besides additional analyses based on all randomised patients, 
the Applicant was invited to discuss a (new) cardiac subgroup defined not only by the cut-off value of left 
ventricular wall thickness, but also on e.g. cardiac medical history deemed related to hATTR cardiomyopathy 
and a NT-proBNP cut-off value. The applicant has examined two alternate definitions of the cardiac 
subpopulation: 
1. the originally used cardiac subgroup criteria OR mean LV wall thickness ≥17mm OR medical history of

2. the originally used cardiac subgroup criteria OR NT-proBNP>650ng/L 
The newly defined cardiac subgroups included more patients (alternative 1: 50 placebo (64.9% of the mITT 
population), 102 patisiran (68.9%), alternative 2: 50 placebo (64.9%), 104 patisiran (70.3%)) than the

original cardiac subgroup (36 placebo (46%), 90 patisiran (60.8%)). (The mITT population was 77 placebo, 
148 patisiran.) 
The results in the two alternate definitions of cardiac subgroups and the pre-specified cardiac subpopulation 
were compared. Echocardiogram results were almost identical in terms of level of p-value, the treatment 
effects on NT-proBNP were highly significant in all three subgroups and the results on deaths and 
hospitalizations didn’t differ either. 
Patisiran treatment effects were very similar in all three alternate definitions of cardiac subgroups. Since the 
newer definitions of the cardiac subgroup included a higher percentage of the mITT population, this could 
indicate that more than half of the total study population actually had cardiac involvement of their hATTR 
disease, and that the exact definition of the cardiac subgroup didn’t affect the results on cardiac endpoints. It 
should also be kept in mind that also the mITT population showed significant results for many of the cardiac 
endpoints. 
A limited number of subjects discontinued from the study, a total of 82.2% of the 225 patients completed 
study treatment, but there was a difference between the patisiran and placebo groups with more subjects 
having discontinued treatment in the placebo group 29/77 (37.7%) versus 11/148 (7.4%) in the patisiran 
group. The most common reason for study treatment discontinuation overall was withdrawal of consent and 
the dominating causes for withdrawal of consent in the placebo group were lack of efficacy or worsening of 
disease. The discontinuation pattern is not supporting a bias favouring the patisiran group as a worsening is 
the expected natural course of hATTR amyloidosis. 
Two adequately designed Phase 1 patisiran-LNP SAD studies in healthy volunteers contributed towrds the 
pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments (eg, TTR levels), pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and safety data.  Study 
ALN-TTR02-002 was an adequate Phase 2 multiple ascending dose (MAD) study that contributed PD, PK, and 
safety data in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy; this study supported the selection of the 
patisiran-LNP dose and regimen for continued development. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-dependent reductions in serum TTR concentrations with patisiran LNP were observed in both healthy 
volunteers and in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Long term dosing with patisiran LNP 
sustained a mean TTR reduction of approximately 80% over 2 years of treatment. Overall, the expected 
effect of patisiran LNP on serum TTR concentrations has been convincingly shown in the clinical studies. 
The difference in neurologic impairment, as measured by mNIS+7, was highly statistically significant: -33.99 
[-39.86; -28.13] points (LS mean (SEM) favouring the patisiran group. Furthermore, in the study 004 the 
mean mNIS+7 change from baseline at 18 months for the placebo group was +27.96 points. This is in line 
with the estimated change per year (+17.8) found in a multinational study of 282 patients with fATTR 
amyloidosis. The patisiran patients mean change at 18 months was -6.03 mNIS+7 points, which is a subtle 
numerical improvement instead of the expected worsening. The favourable effect of patisiran-LNP shown by 
mNIS+7 results was already observed at 9 month and it further improved leading to a large effect size at 18 
months. It showed consistent improvement across motor, sensory, and autonomic components of neuropathy 
confirming a clinical relevant effect. 
Statistically significant differences favouring Patisiran-LNP group compared to placebo at 18 months were 
also observed for all secondary endpoints, as illustrated by quality of life as assessed by Norfolk QoL-DN at 
18 months group (LS mean difference between Patisiran-LNP – Placebo groups, [95% CI, p-value]): (-21.3

points [-27.2; -15.0, P=1.103 ×10-10]), motor strength (NIS-W)( -17.87 points [ -22.32, -13.43, P=1.404E-
13]), disability (R-ODS)(+9.0 points [7.0, 10.9, P=4.066E-16]), gait speed (10-MWT)( 0.311 m/sec [0.23, 
0.39, P=1.875E-12]), nutritional status (mBMI)( +115.7 kg/m2 × albumin g/L [82.4, 149.0, P=8.832E-11]) 
and autonomic symptoms (COMPASS 31)( -7.53 points [-11.89, -3.16, P=0.0008]), supporting the 
statistically significant differences between Patisiran-LNP group and placebo for the primary endpoint. 
Secondary endpoints reflect clinically relevant oucomes which account for a broad range of clinical 
manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis, including improved quality of life (Norfolk QoL-DN), motor strength 
(NIS-W), disability (R-ODS), gait speed (10-MWT), nutritional status (mBMI) and autonomic symptoms 
(COMPASS 31). The consistent favourable results on all these secondary endpoints support the results of the 
primary end-point and further confirm that patisiran treatment achieves clinically meaningful benefits in 
hATTR amyloidosis patients.  
For the primary endpoint, a number of sensitivity analyses were planned. Most of them however relying on 
the assumption of missing at random (MAR). With the preferred estimate being that from the pattern mixture 
model (PMM), additional analyses were requested that were to be performed using a model including the data 
that were observed after discontinuation of study treatment and otherwise based on placebo-based multiple 
imputations for all missing or excluded data (i.e. a ‘jump to reference’, addressing the treatment effect if 
there is no benefit from treatment after treatment discontinuation; or for patients using alternative 
treatments). The additional analyses submitted were performed using instead of a ‘jump to reference’ 
approach (requested), a ‘copy reference’ approach was used. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
New analyses were requested and the Applicant provided the requested PMM J2R analyses based on a data 
set excluding in total 12 patients, 4 from the patisiran-LNP arm and 8 from the placebo arm, who had efficacy 
assessments performed at a site found to be GCP non-compliant (Site 061 in Mallorca). In line with the 
earlier presented PMM ‘copy reference’ analyses (based on the full mITT population), the point estimates of 
the differences between patisiran-LNP and placebo as well as the corresponding 95% CIs from the PMM ‘jump 
to reference’ (J2R) analyses were very similar compared to the primary analysis although, as could be 
expected, implied slightly smaller differences between patisiran-LNP and placebo for the mNIS+7 and Norfolk 
QoL-DN endpoints respectively, as well as slightly bigger p-values. The same was true comparing the PMM 
J2R analyses with the newly performed MMRM analyses excluding patients who had efficacy assessments 
performed at Site 061 in Mallorca. Given that the outcomes between the PMM J2R analyses were very similar 
the results from the MMRM analyses could be acceptable, the CHMP considered that the latter results are 
suitable to reflect the treatment effects in the SmPC. 
Change from baseline in mNIS+7 compared to placebo across all subgroups (age [<65; ≥65], gender, race 
[white, non-white], region [North America, Western Europe, Rest of World], NIS [< 50; ≥ 50], genotype 
[V30M; non-V30M], genotype class [Early onset V30M; Other], previous tetramer use, FAP stage [I& II ] and 
cardiac subpopulation) shows a consistent difference in favour of patisiran. 
In addition, the same trend favouring patisiran group compared to placebo were seen for mNIS+7 and 
Norfolk QoL-DN for all the different genotypes with 10 or more patients included. 
Overall, the effects measured on neuropathy in the subgroups clearly indicate that patisiran is effective in the 
different subgroups analysed.  
For the cardiac exploratory echocardiographic end-points in the cardiac subpopulation, patisiran-LNP 
treatment resulted in an LS mean statistical significant decrease of 0.093 cm (95% CI:  -0.169, -0.017) in 
mean LV wall thickness compared to placebo.   
A difference in longitudinal strain, a measure of cardiac function, was also observed in the cardiac 
subpopulation favouring patisiran-LNP compared to placebo, with an LS mean treatment difference in 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 129/188 
  
  
absolute change from baseline at 18 months of -1.37% (95% CI:  -2.48%,  -0.27%).  
For LVEDV, a parameter of ventricular stiffness and distensibility, a difference favouring patisiran-LNP 
treatment compared to placebo was also observed. 
To further describe the magnitude of the treatment effect of patisiran-LNP on cardiac structure and function, 
the Applicant has identified the proportion of patients that achieved a decrease (change from baseline) of >2 
mm in mean LV wall thickness and the proportion of patients that achieved an improvement of > absolute 
2% for longitudinal strain, as presented in the Study 004 CSR. These thresholds were chosen to be greater 
than the values suggested as being predicative of outcomes based on published data noted above (Quarta 
2014). However, the results from this study show only a limited association between each incremental 1% in 
longitudinal strain and risk of death (HR 1.1 95%CI 1.01-1.19) and half of the study population had AL 
amyloidosis which has a worse prognosis. Further the predictive value of this surrogate marker is not known 
in the context of interventional therapy. 
Patisiran-LNP treatment was associated with larger effects on NT-proBNP compared to placebo. In the cardiac 
subpopulation, at baseline, geometric mean NT-proBNP levels were 726.92 and 711.10 ng/L in the patisiran-
LNP and placebo groups, respectively.  At month 18, geometric mean NT-proBNP decreased to 544.06 ng/L in 
the patisiran-LNP group and increased to 1116.75 ng/L in the placebo group. Data on the relationship 
between NT-proBNP response to intervention and mortality outcomes in AL amyloidosis is available from 5 
large, independent studies (Merlini 2016). Data from these studies show that, in patients with a baseline NT-
proBNP > 650 ng/L, changes in NT-proBNP of >30% and >300 ng/L in response to interventions are 
predictive of mortality outcomes (albeit that these patients have a worse prognosis compared to the current 
target population). 
In the 004 Study, in the cardiac subpopulation, approximately one third of evaluable patients (baseline NT-
proBNP ≥650 ng/L and non-missing 18 month data) on the patisiran-LNP arm demonstrated a decrease from 
baseline in NT-proBNP of >30% and >300 ng/L compared to 0% in the placebo arm. 
All predefined exploratory analyses of cardiac endpoints intended to compare the two treatment groups were 
performed using MMRM. Considering the number of subjects excluded and given the underlying assumption 
of missing at random, sensitivity analyses of cardiac endpoints were requested to be based on methods for 
imputation of missing data that could be considered sufficiently conservative. These additional analyses were 
to be based on efficacy data sets excluding data from the (GCP non-compliant) site in Mallorca Spain. The 
additional analyses based on pattern mixture models using a ‘Jump to reference’ (PMM J2R) approach were 
provided and were based on the cardiac subpopulation excluding those patients who had efficacy 
assessments performed at Site 061. The cardiac subpopulation included 87 and 35 patients of those 
randomised to the patisiran-LNP arm and the placebo arm respectively. Overall, 31.4%-37.1% of the patients 
on placebo included in the cardiac subpopulation had missing data compared to 11.4%-16.1% on patisiran-
LNP, depending on endpoint. The outcomes from the PMM J2R analyses were similar to the outcomes from 
analyses based on MMRM with nominally significant differences between patisiran-LNP treated patients and 
placebo patients for three cardiac endpoints as discussed above (NTproBNP, LV wall thickness, and LV 
longitudinal strain) of the six cardiac endpoints as pre-defined in the SAP (LV wall thickness, LV mass, LVEF, 
LV longitudinal strain, NT-proBNP and troponin I). 
Similar changes over time were also observed in the mITT population for the cardiac end-points. 
In addition, change from baseline in NT-proBNP compared to placebo across all subgroups (age [<65; ≥65], 
gender, race [white, non-white], region [North America, Western Europe, Rest of World], NIS [< 50; ≥ 50], 
genotype [V30M; non-V30M], genotype class [Early onset V30M; Other], previous tetramer use, FAP stage [I 
& II] and cardiac subpopulation) shows a difference in favour of patisiran.

2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is a autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) 
The formation of amyloid fibrils and plaques from mutant TTR in the extracellular space of various tissues, 
including the peripheral nervous system, heart, and gastrointestinal tract is the main characteristic of hATTR. 
The patisiran-mediated inhibition of the synthesis of wild-type (wt) and mutant TTR proteins resulted in 
significant reduction in circulating TTR levels. 
The study population in the pivotal study 004 was limited to subjects with Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) 
Scores of 0-IIIB hATTR/FDP stage 1 and 2. It is acknowledged that the clinical data from study 004 shows a 
convincing difference between patisiran and placebo regardless of baseline disease stages at inclusion for the 
studied population.   The favourable effect of patisiran-LNP shown by mNIS+7 results was already observed 
at 9 month and it further improved leading to a large effect size at 18 months. It showed consistent 
improvement across motor, sensory, and autonomic components of neuropathy though suggesting a clinical 
relevant effect. Statistically significant differences favouring Patisiran-LNP group compared to placebo at 18 
months were also observed for all secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints reflect clinically relevant 
outcomes which account for a broad range of clinical manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis, including 
improved quality of life (Norfolk QoL-DN), motor strength (NIS-W), disability (R-ODS), gait speed (10-MWT), 
nutritional status (mBMI) and autonomic symptoms (COMPASS 31). The internal consistency of the primary 
and secondary endpoints efficacy results and the large effect sizes obtained across all endpoints are 
supportive of the clinically meaningful effect of patisiran treatment. 
The development programme included cardiac endpoints as exploratory surrogate endpoints in a cardiac 
subpopulation which comprised of 56% of the study population. The results of the pivotal study show a 
difference compared to placebo for several of the measured echocardiographic variables as well as on NT-
proBNP, favoring patisiran. Even though some of endpoints may have a prognostic value, it is unclear if these 
surrogate markers (as well as the magnitude of the documented differences) are predictive of clinically 
relevant outcomes in the context of therapeutic interventions. It is however acknowledged that literature 
data (Merlini 2016) supports the importance of changes in NT-proBNP of >30% and >300 ng/L in response to 
interventions which may be predictive of mortality outcomes in patients with AL amyloidosis. (Ultimately, the 
results indicate that patisiran may have an effect on the heart (which is considered plausible from a biological 
perspective) even though the importance of this effect is not fully understood. 
The study population in the pivotal study 004 was limited to subjects with Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) 
Scores of 0-IIIB hATTR/FAP stage 1 and 2. It is acknowledged that the clinical data from study 004 shows a 
convincing difference between patisiran and placebo regardless of baseline disease stages at inclusion for the 
studied population. However, there is only very limited data in patients with more severe disease and it is 
therefore not found adequate to extrapolate the results from less severe to more advanced stages of the 
disease (PND stage IV/FAP stage 3 = non ambulatory patients).  
For the claim “treatment of adult patients with hATTR”, the CHMP was of the opinion that an effect of 
treatment on both neurological and cardiac manifestations of the disease should be documented.  The effect 
on neurological symptoms have been shown while, there were several uncertainties concerning the clinical 
relevance of the data supporting an effect of patisiran on cardiac manifestations. However, considering that 
the sought indication is not an explicit claim with respect to treatment of cardiomyopathy, the fact that 
patisiran treatment seems to have positive impact on cardiac parameters the CHMP considers that the 
presented data supports the following indication; Onpattro is indicated for the treatment of hereditary

transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 
polyneuropathy”. The applicant accepted the CHMP position and amended the sought indication accordingly. 
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, the integrated safety database includes 218 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy 
exposed to patisiran-LNP for a period of up to 3.74 years.  These data represent a total of 412.3 patient-
years of exposure.  
In addition to the clinical studies described above, patisiran-LNP is also currently being administered to 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy via an ongoing Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) in the 
United States and compassionate use programs in the EU.  As of the data cutoff of 14 July 2017, a total of 48 
patients were treated in the EAP, representing 11.5 person-years of exposure; at the time of this cutoff, no 
patients had been dosed in the compassionate use program. 
Safety pools: 
“Placebo-controlled experience” (Double-blind, placebo-controlled pool) 
Study 004 
According to the protocol, patients were to receive study drug for 78 weeks (total of 27 doses). 
The mean duration of study drug was 17.7 months in the patisiran-LNP group (N= 148) and 15.0 months in 
the placebo group (N=77), with 218.9 person-years of exposure in the patisiran-LNP group and 96.1 person-
years in the placebo group.  In the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups, respectively, there were 96.6% and 
87.0% of patients who had received study drug for at least 6 months, 94.6% and 71.4% of patients who had 
received study drug for at least 12 months, and 93.2% and 66.2% of patients who had received study drug 
for at least 15 months.  
 “Overall pooled experience” (Long-term safety pool) 
Studies 003, 004, 006 
In the overall pooled experience across studies 003, 004, and 006, 218 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy were treated with patisiran-LNP for durations of up to 44.9 months, with 412.3 person-years 
of exposure.  Overall, 179 patients (82.1%) were treated for ≥12 months, 101 patients (46.3%) were 
treated for ≥24 months and 32 patients (14.7%) were treated for ≥36 months.  The mean duration of 
patisiran-LNP exposure was 22.69 months (range: 0.7 to 44.9).  The mean number of doses received was 
31.9 (range: 1 to 65) 
The primary factors that were considered in the strategy for selecting studies in the integrated analysis were 
to include studies that utilized the same dose, dose regimen and infusion regimen that is proposed to be used 
commercially, and which were evaluated in the target patient population.  All 3 studies were multicenter, 
enrolled patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and documented TTR mutation, dosed patients 
with patisiran-LNP at 0.3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, administered study drug as an approximately 80-
minute IV infusion, and collected a similar battery of safety assessments.

• 
TEAEs are those with onset during or after the first dose through 28 days following the last dose of study drug.  In addition, any event 
that was present at baseline but worsened in intensity or was subsequently considered drug-related is considered a TEAE. 
• 
• 
• 
Related AEs are AEs that are deemed to be either ‘definitely related’ or ‘possibly related’ to study drug by the Investigator. 
If a patient experienced more than 1 event in a given category, that patient is counted only once in that category.  
Patients who discontinued study treatment could remain in the study and were considered to have completed the study if they 
completed the 18 Month visit 
All deaths are summarized, including deaths due to AEs that are not treatment-emergent.  An additional placebo patient who withdrew from 
the study due to a deterioration of health status and worsening cardiac failure was reported to have died shortly after the end of the study.  
A greater proportion of patients on patisiran-LNP (≥5 percentage point difference) experienced an AE in the 
following SOC:  general disorders and administration site conditions (patisiran-LNP 58.8%, placebo 51.9%) 
with the difference mostly in peripheral edema; immune system disorders (patisiran-LNP 20.3%, placebo

with a ≥5 percentage point higher frequency in the patisiran-LNP group than the placebo group included

peripheral edema events in the patisiran-LNP group decreased over the course of the study (first 9 months: 
range 7.6% to 10.8%, 49 events; second 9 months: range 2.1% to 6.5%, 20 events).  In contrast, in the 
placebo group, the proportion of patients and number of events showed an increasing trend (first 9 months: 
range 4.0% to 7.5%; 15 events; second 9 months: range 5.9% to 12.5%, 20 events).  All of the AEs of 
peripheral edema were mild or moderate in severity.  Of the 29.7% of patients in the patisiran-LNP group 
with peripheral edema, mild and moderate events by maximum severity were experienced by 18.9% and 
10.8% of patients, respectively; of the 22.1% of placebo patients with peripheral edema, mild and moderate 
events by maximum severity were experienced by 10.4% and 11.7% of patients, respectively.  Peripheral 
edema was considered related to study drug in 1 patient (0.7%, 1 event) in the patisiran-LNP group and 5 
patients (6.5%, 8 events) in the placebo group.  One patient  in the patisiran-LNP group was admitted to the 
hospital (SAE) to have cardiac testing performed (echocardiogram and right cardiac catheterization) to 
investigate chronic inferior limb edema considered related to the patient’s amyloidosis.  The event was 
considered not related to study drug.  No patients discontinued treatment due to peripheral edema, and 1 
patient in the placebo group had an infusion cycle delay.  
Dyspnoea was reported in 10 patients (6.8%, 14 events) in the patisiran-LNP group and no patients in the 
placebo group.  The majority of these patients had a medical history of cardiac disorders, with dyspnoea 
reported by 6 patients (6.7%, 8 events) in the patisiran-LNP group in the cardiac subpopulation.  When 
dyspnoea was analyzed over time, the proportion of patients and number of events decreased over time (first 
9 months: 2.0-2.1%, 10 events; second 9 months: 0.7-1.4%, 4 events).  Most of the events were mild or 
moderate in severity.  Two patients in the patisiran-LNP group had single events of dyspnoea that were

considered severe.  None of the events led to treatment discontinuation or were considered IRRs and no 
action was taken with the study drug.  All of the events were considered not related or unlikely related to 
study drug by the investigators.  One patient  who had been having worsening dyspnoea due to congestive 
heart failure and associated chest discomfort was admitted to the hospital (SAE) for evaluation and treatment 
of worsening orthostatic hypotension.  The patient’s medications were adjusted and the event resolved. The 
event was considered not related to study drug.   
Arthralgia, mostly as pain in the knee, hip, or ankle, was reported in 11 patients (7.4%, 13 events) in the 
patisiran-LNP group and no patients in the placebo group.  All of the events were mild or moderate in 
severity.  None of the events led to treatment discontinuation or were considered IRRs, and no action was 
taken with study drug.  All of the events were considered not related or unlikely related to study drug by the 
investigators.  
Muscle spasms were reported in 12 patients (8.1%, 18 events) in the patisiran-LNP group and 1 patient 
(1.3%, 1 event) in the placebo group.  Most of the events were mild in severity except for 1 transient event 
that was moderate in severity.  None of the events led to treatment discontinuation or were considered IRRs, 
and no action was taken with study drug.  Most of the events were considered not related or unlikely related 
to study drug except for 1 mild event which was possibly related.   
In the patisiran-LNP group, for the other AEs listed in Table 32 (dyspepsia, erythema, vertigo, rhinitis, 
sinusitis, and bronchitis), most of the patients had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity.  There were 2 
patients with severe events: 1 patient  with dyspepsia and 1 patient  with vertigo.  Both severe events were 
transient, considered unlikely or not related to study drug, and did not result in any change of dose or action 
with drug.  Overall, none of the events cited above led to discontinuation of treatment or had any action 
taken with study drug.

AEs with a ≥5% higher frequency in the placebo group compared to the patisiran-LNP group included falls, 
nausea, urinary tract infections, muscular weakness, anemia, syncope, dehydration, hematuria, weight 
decreased, abdominal pain upper, hemorrhoids, hyponatremia, supraventricular extrasystole, and 
atrioventricular block first degree.  
Adverse drug reactions for patisiran-LNP are defined to include those AEs that occurred with a ≥3% higher 
frequency in patisiran-LNP treated patients compared with placebo in the pivotal Study 004 and other 
potentially relevant AEs based on other studies with patisiran-LNP (Studies 001, 002, 003, 005, and 006).  
Evidence for causality can be based on the mechanism of action of a drug, medical review of individual or 
aggregate AEs, analysis of laboratory data, and other information. 
AEs of special interest for patisiran-LNP 
The following AEs (IRR, liver, cardiac, renal, ocular, thyroid) are considered AEs of special interest for 
patisiran-LNP given the mechanism of action-specific concerns related to patisiran-LNP, the class- and 
platform-related adverse effects seen with siRNAs and lipid nanoparticles and the non-clinical toxicology 
findings and the disease-related pathophysiology of hATTR amyloidosis. AEs and related laboratory findings 
are presented together to facilitate the reading.

Infusion-related AEs (Infusion-related reactions, IRR) incl infusion interruptions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRR) 
In the SAD study with healthy volunteers, there was only 1 IRR reported, in the single subjects who received 
patisiran at the 500 μg/kg dose.  
In the MAD study 002, IRRs occurred in 3 (10.3%) patients, all of whom were in the 300 μg/kg Q4W dose 
group, and all of whom received the original premedication regimen. There were no IRRs reported among the 
12 patients in the 300 μg/kg Q3W dose group, 9 of who had received patisiran as a 70-minute infusion with 
the alternative premedication regimen. 
In Study 004, in which all patients received premedication prior to receiving patisiran-LNP or normal saline 
placebo, a total of 28 (18.9%) patients in the patisiran-LNP group and 7 (9.1%) patients in the placebo group 
reported at least 1 IRR.  All IRRs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved.  There were no severe 
IRRs, and no IRRs were reported as SAEs. One patient in the patisiran-LNP group discontinued study 
treatment due to an IRR of moderate flushing that resolved within 15 minutes. None of the IRRs in the 
placebo group led to discontinuation of study treatment or led to the interruption of infusion. 
In the patisiran-LNP group, of the patients with IRRs, the majority (78.6%, 22 of 28 patients) had their first 
IRR within the first 2 doses and >82.1% by the third dose. 
Infusion related reaction signs and symptoms reported in ≥2% of patients in the patisiran- LNP group were 
back pain (6.1%), flushing (4.1%), nausea (3.4%), headache (2.7%), and arthralgia and dyspnoea (2.0% 
each).  The only IRR sign or symptom reported in ≥2% of patients in the placebo group was flushing (7.8%).  
Flushing occurred in both groups and was most likely due to premedication or other causes.

Extravasation  
In Study 004, 12 patients had 12 infusions with AEs that were potentially associated with or possible 
symptoms of extravasation (11 patients in the patisiran-LNP group with 11 events and 1 patient in the 
placebo group with 1 event).  Adverse events associated with possible events of extravasation included 
Assessment report

phlebitis, superficial thrombophlebitis, cellulitis, dermatitis (subcutaneous inflammation at infusion site), and 
infusion site swelling, erythema, pain, burning sensation, or extravasation.  One of the events in the 
patisiran-LNP group occurred after administration of premedication during the saline flush and prior to 
administration of study drug.  Two patients in the patisiran-LNP group had events of superficial 
thrombophlebitis/post procedural cellulitis and dermatitis (subcutaneous inflammation)/phlebitis/infusion site 
extravasation  that were reported as SAEs.  All patients, including the 2 patients with SAEs, had events that 
were mild or moderate in severity. All events resolved without sequelae.  Dosing was interrupted in 4 of the 
11 patients in the patisiran-LNP group and in the 1 patient in the placebo group who had a moderate event.  
None of the patients in either group were discontinued due to extravasation.  All patients in the patisiran-LNP 
and placebo groups received a complete dose and went on to complete study treatment.  
Similar results were seen in Study 003.  Five patients had 6 events of possible extravasation.  Adverse events 
associated with possible events extravasation included:  1 event of phlebitis in 1 patient, 2 events of infusion 
site irritation in 1 patient, and 3 events of infusion site extravasation in 3 patients, of which one event was 
associated with infusion site erythema, pain, and fever All events were non-serious, mild in severity, and 
resolved.  Study drug was interrupted in 4 cases, and the patients received complete doses.  
In Study 006, 4 patients had 4 events of possible extravasation.  Adverse events associated with possible 
events of extravasation included 2 events of injection site swelling in 2 patients, 1 patient with phlebitis, and 
1 patient with an SAE of phlebitis/cellulitis/hypotension.  The events were mild or moderate in severity, 
including the SAE, and resolved.  There were no infusion interruptions and the patients received complete 
doses.  
Overall, potential events of extravasation have been reported in 0.3% of infusions (21 events in 6954 
administrations) in patients administered patisiran-LNP and characterized by symptoms of phlebitis, or 
localized pain, burning sensation, swelling, tenderness, or redness at or near the infusion site.  There have 
been no reports of tissue injury or damage such as blistering, exfoliation, or skin necrosis around or near the 
infusion site. 
Infusion Interruption 
Overall, in the patisiran-LNP group, based on the cumulative number of doses administered across all 
patients, the number of infusions with AEs leading to infusion interruption (17 of 3740 doses) and number of 
patients with AEs leading to infusion interruption who received partial doses (2 of 3740 doses) was low. 
Of the 6954 doses of patisiran-LNP administered across the pooled experience, there were 114 events of 
infusion interruption; in 109 of these interruptions, the complete dose of patisiran-LNP was received. A total 
of 18 (8.3%) patients across the pooled experience reported an AE leading to an infusion interruption.  AEs 
that led to an infusion interruption reported in ≥1% of patients were IRRs (6.0%) and infusion site 
extravasation (2.3%).  
Premedication and IRRs 
All patients in the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups received a premedication regimen including 
corticosteroids prior to each dose of study drug to reduce the potential for an IRR.  During the study, 2 
premedication regimens were used:  the original premedication regimen and the reduced premedication 
regimen.  The reduced regimen was amended to the protocol to mitigate potential AEs suspected to be 
related to corticosteroids, such as flushing.  At the time of the amendment, patients who were receiving 
study drug were transitioned to the reduced regimen and newly enrolled patients started and received all 
infusions with the reduced regimen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 140/188 
  
  
With respect to IRRs, analysis of IRRs following the original and reduced regimens demonstrated that there 
was no increase in IRRs when patients received the reduced regimen compared to the original regimen, and 
that patisiran-LNP was well tolerated on both regimens.  On the original premedication regimen, there were 
22 patients (17.9%) in the patisiran-LNP group and 7 patients (10.1%) in the placebo group with at least 1 
IRR; on the reduced premedication regimen at least 1 IRR occurred in 9 patients in the patisiran-LNP group 
(6.9%) and in 3 patients in the placebo group (5.1%).  Furthermore, in an evaluation of IRR signs and 
symptoms by premedication regimen, no notable differences were observed after the change in 
premedication regimen. 
Adverse events related to premedication  
Investigators were asked to assess whether an AE was considered related to premedication.   
In the placebo-controlled experience, the proportion of patients with AEs considered related to 
premedications by the investigators was similar across the patisiran-LNP (36.5%) and placebo (36.4%) 
groups.  Adverse events reported in ≥3% of patients in either treatment group included osteoporosis, 
dizziness, somnolence, and insomnia. Serious AEs considered related to premedications were reported in a 
total of 4 patients: 1 patient with deafness unilateral in the patisiran-LNP group; and 3 patients in the 
placebo group (1 patient with oesophagitis, pulmonary oedema and urinary retention; 1 patient with urinary 
tract infections; and 1 patient with erysipelas and skin ulcer).  
In the placebo-controlled experience, an analysis of AEs related to the premedication regimen comparing the 
original and reduced regimens demonstrated that there was a decrease in the proportion of patients and 
number of events with AEs considered related to premedications reported after the switch to the reduced 
premedication regimen.  The proportion of patients with AEs considered related to the original regimen was 
29.3% (106 events) and 37.7% (77 events) in the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups, respectively, and AEs 
considered related to the reduced regimen was 19.1% (54 events) and 20.3% (28 events) in the patisiran -
LNP and placebo groups, respectively. In Study 004, the cumulative study drug exposure for the two 2 
regimens was similar. 
Adverse events of selected events associated with glucocorticoids such as Cushingoid (1patient), 
hyperglycemia (3 patients), glycosuria urine present (2 patients), glucose tolerance impaired (1 patient), and 
diabetes (0 patients) were limited.  In the pooled experience, osteopenia and osteoporosis were reported in 9 
and 12 patients, respectively.  When evaluated over time, the reports of osteopenia and osteoporosis were 
scattered with the majority reported during the first year and did not increase over time.    
Hepatobiliary events and liver function tests 
Adverse events 
Because patisiran-LNP targets the liver and because nonclinical studies of patisiran-LNP revealed changes in 
serum liver markers and liver histopathology, the frequency of hepatic AEs was evaluated by performing an 
analysis of events mapping to the Drug-related hepatic disorders standardized MedDRA query (SMQ). 
In Study 004, the proportion of patients with hepatic events mapping to the SMQ was similar across the 
patisiran-LNP (5.4%) and placebo (9.1%) groups.  Within the SMQ, the frequency of AEs in the Hepatobiliary 
disorders SOC (1.4% patisiran-LNP, 1.3% placebo) and Investigations SOC (3.4% patisiran-LNP, 3.9% 
placebo,) were similar across the 2 treatment groups.  In the placebo group, hypoalbuminemia was reported 
in 2 (2.6%) of patients, and 1 patient underwent a liver transplant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 141/188 
  
  
Most of the hepatic AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and considered not or unlikely related to study 
drug.  In the placebo group, 1 patient had a severe AE of hypoalbuminemia considered unlikely related to 
study drug.  Hepatic AEs considered possibly related to study drug were hepatic enzyme increased and blood 
ALP increased in the patisiran--LNP group (1 patient [0.7%] each) and hypoalbuminemia in the placebo 
group (1 patient [1.3%]), all of which were mild in severity.  Hepatic AEs that were SAEs were reported in 
3 patients in the placebo group (LFTs abnormal, hypoalbuminemia, and liver transplant; 1 patient each) and 
in 1 patient in the patisiran-LNP group (ascites).  All hepatic SAEs were considered unlikely or not related to 
study drug. 
In the overall pooled analysis, the proportion of patients with hepatic events mapping to the Drug-related 
hepatic disorders SMQ was 4.6% and similar to the placebo-controlled experience.  Most hepatic events 
reported were laboratory elevations within the investigations SOC, which occurred in 3.2% of subjects.  
Hepatic events reported in ≥1% of patients were ALT increased (1.4%) and ALP increased (1.4%); in all 
patients in whom these AEs appeared, the AEs were consistently mild in severity and, in most cases, not 
considered related to study treatment. 
Liver function tests 
Mean ALT and AST levels remained relatively constant over the course of the MAD study (study ALN-TTR02-
002) for all dose groups, except for the 300 μg/kg Q3W dose group at Day 7. In this group, the highest 
individual ALT and AST values observed were 99 U/L and 110 U/L, respectively, and resolved to normal by 
Day 14. 
In Study 004, mean absolute values and mean percent changes from baseline for LFT parameters, including 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and ALP, were generally stable and similar across the patisiran-LNP and placebo 
groups.  Shifts from baseline to worst post-baseline values for LFTs in the patisiran-LNP group compared with 
the placebo group did not show any clinically significant patterns.

Note: mean and standard deviation are presented for each parameter in each panel. 
A summary of abnormalities in worst post-baseline LFTs is presented in the table below. The majority of 
patients in Study 004 had ALT and AST values within normal limits.  Overall, 12 (15.6%) patients in the 
placebo group and 47 (31.8%) patients in the patisiran-LNP group had at least 1 ALT or AST value >ULN.  
Most of these elevations were ≤3 × ULN.  One patient (0.7%) in the patisiran-LNP group had a transient 
elevation of ALT >3 × ULN and is described below.  No patients had ALT or AST values >3×ULN with 
concurrent elevation of total bilirubin >2×ULN at any time during Study 004.

One patient had a transient, asymptomatic elevation of ALT >3 × ULN that was not associated with elevation 
of bilirubin and is discussed below.  There were no patients with elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, i.e. no cases fulfilling the Hy’s Law criteria. 
Results for LFT evaluations in Study 003 and Study 006 were similar to the placebo-controlled experience.  In 
Study 003, few patients had shifts in liver function parameters.  One patient (3.7%) had a shift in ALT 
>3×ULN and ≤5×ULN (3.13×ULN) that was not associated with an elevation in bilirubin.  All other shifts in 
liver function parameters were minor (>ULN to ≤3 × ULN for ALT and AST, >ULN to ≤1.5×ULN for total 
bilirubin, and >1.5×ULN for alkaline phosphatase).  No patients in Study 003 had elevations of AST or ALT 
>3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN.   
In Study 006, most patients did not exhibit shifts in liver function parameters, and shifts in LFTs were 
generally considered not clinically relevant.  No patients in the clinical database had ALT or AST values 
> 3× ULN and no patients had total bilirubin values >2×ULN.  There was 1 patient  who had an SAE of 
transaminase increased in the setting of a cellulitis of the lower leg.  The event was considered related to an 
inflammatory response due to the cellulitis and not related to study drug.  The patient had elevation of ALT 
and AST >3 × ULN that resolved quickly when the cellulitis improved.

Cardiac events, ECG and blood pressure 
As patients with hATTR amyloidosis often have cardiac involvement, an evaluation of cardiac AEs based on 
the Cardiac disorders SOC was conducted.   
At baseline in Study 004, 63.5% of patients in the patisiran-LNP group and 72.7% of patients in the placebo 
group had a medical history of conditions with terms that mapped within to the Cardiac disorders SOC. A 
higher proportion of patients in the placebo group (24.7%) were noted to have in their medical history terms 
that mapped to the Cardiac device therapeutic procedures HLT (including cardiac pacemaker insertion, 
implantable defibrillator insertion, and pacemaker generated rhythm) compared to the patisiran-LNP group 
(14.2%), as well as to the HLT Myocardial disorders NEC (27.0% patisiran-LNP, 46.8% placebo), driven by 
the PT term cardiac amyloidosis (21.6% patisiran-LNP, 36% placebo).  In contrast, a higher proportion of 
patients in the patisiran-LNP group (7.4%) had medical history terms that mapped to the HLT Ventricular 
arrhythmias and cardiac arrest compared to the placebo group (3.9%).  
During Study 004, the proportion of patients with AEs (28.4% patisiran-LNP; 36.4% placebo) and SAEs 
(13.5% patisiran-LNP; 13.0% placebo) within the Cardiac disorders SOC was similar across the 2 treatment 
groups. Cardiac AEs reported in ≥5% of patients in either group were atrial fibrillation (8.8% patisiran-LNP, 
6.5% placebo), atrioventricular block first degree (0% patisiran--LNP, 5.2% placebo), cardiac failure (4.7% 
patisiran-LNP, 5.2% placebo), and supraventricular tachycardia extrasystole (1.4% patisiran-LNP, 6.5% 
placebo).  Cardiac SAEs reported in ≥2% of patients in the patisiran-LNP group were atrioventricular block 
complete, cardiac failure, and cardiac failure congestive in 2.0% (3 patients) each. In the placebo group, 
cardiac SAEs reported in ≥2% of patients were cardiac failure and cardiac failure congestive in 2.6% 
(2 patients) each. 
An additional analysis of cardiac SAEs that resulted in hospitalizations or death was performed.  A total of 18 
patients (12.2%) in the patisiran-LNP group and 10 patients (13.0%) in the placebo group had at least 1 
hospitalization or death due to SAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC, with mean number of events of 1.0 in the 
patisiran-LNP group and 1.5 in the placebo group.  The proportion of patients with 2 or more hospitalizations 
or deaths in the Cardiac SOC was higher in the placebo group than the patisiran-LNP group.  The rate of 
hospitalizations or death in the Cardiac SOC was lower in the patisiran-LNP group (9.6 per 100 patient-years) 
than in the placebo group (15.6 per 100 patient-years). 
As patients with hATTR amyloidosis frequently have conduction defects, an analysis of AEs within the HLGT of 
Cardiac arrhythmia was performed.  The proportion of patients with AEs that mapped within the Cardiac 
arrhythmias HLGT was lower in the patisiran-LNP group (28 patients [18.9%]) than in the placebo group 
(22 patients [28.6%]). This difference was also notable across the various HLTs, including the Cardiac 
conduction disorders HLT (6.8% patisiran-LNP, 9.1% placebo), Supraventricular arrhythmias HLT (10.1% 
patisiran-LNP, 16.9% placebo), and Ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest HLT (2.7% patisiran-LNP, 
7.8% placebo).  The only imbalance was in the Rate and rhythm disorders NEC HLT (3.4% [5 patients] 
patisiran-LNP, 0%  placebo), which was predominantly due to 3 patients (2.0%) with bradycardia (reported 
in patients with history of cardiomyopathy, or conduction disorders such as atrioventricular block, atrial 
fibrillation and atrial flutter, and all considered unlikely or not related to study drug).  An analysis of AEs 
within the Torsade de pointes SMQ was also performed to search for possible events of QTc prolongation.  
The proportion of patients with AEs mapping to this SMQ was lower in the patisiran-LNP group (5.4%) 
compared to the placebo group (18.2%) No events of Torsade de pointes were reported.   
As patients with cardiac amyloid involvement frequently develop progressive heart failure, an analysis of AE 
terms mapping to the Cardiac failure SMQ using both a narrow and comprehensive search was performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 145/188 
  
  
The proportion of patients with AEs mapping within the Cardiac failure SMQ using both a narrow search 
(9.5% patisiran-LNP, 10.4% placebo) and a comprehensive search (34.5% patisiran-LNP, 33.8% placebo) 
was similar across the two 2 treatment groups.  
In the overall pooled analysis, 148 (67.9%) patients had a medical history of conditions within the Cardiac 
disorders SOC at baseline.  
Overall, the proportion of patients with AEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC was 28.0%.  Cardiac events 
reported in ≥3% of patients were atrial fibrillation (7.3%), cardiac failure (4.6%), cardiac failure congestive 
(3.2%), and cardiac amyloidosis (3.2%).  For the majority of patients who experienced cardiac AEs, the 
maximum severity was mild or moderate (62.3%). The proportion of patients experiencing cardiac AEs 
remained stable over the course of the study.  
In the overall pooled experience, a  total of 37 patients (17.0%) had SAEs within the Cardiac disorders SOC; 
none were considered related to the study treatment.  Serious cardiac events reported in 3 or more patients 
were cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac failure, and cardiac failure congestive (5 patients each, 2.3%); cardiac 
arrest (4 patients, 1.8%), and conduction disorder (3 patients, 1.4%).  
In the overall pooled experience, there were 40 patients (18.3%) with AEs that mapped within the Cardiac 
arrhythmias HLGT, consistent with the patisiran-LNP group in the placebo-controlled study.  A total of 13 
patients (6.0%), 21 patients (9.6%), 6 patients (2.8%), and 9  patients (4.1%) of patients had AEs mapping 
within the HLTs of Cardiac conduction disorders, Supraventricular arrhythmias, Ventricular arrhythmias and 
cardiac arrest, and Rate and rhythm disorder NEC, respectively. The proportion of patients with AEs mapping 
to the Torsade de pointes SMQ in the overall pooled experience was 15 patients (6.9%), with no events of 
Torsade de pointes reported. In the overall pooled experience, the proportion of patients with AEs mapping 
within the Cardiac failure SMQ using both a narrow search and a comprehensive search was 9.2% (20 
patients) and 32.6% (71 patients), respectively.   These proportions are consistent with those observed in 
Study 004.   
In the clinical studies, the type and nature of cardiac events reported were consistent with those expected in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis and there were no safety concerns considered related to patisiran-LNP.  Of 
note, the rate of hospitalizations or deaths in the Cardiac SOC was lower in the patisiran-LNP group compared 
to placebo. Similarly, the proportion of patients with AEs mapping within the Cardiac arrhythmias HLGT and 
Torsade de pointes SMQ were lower in the patisiran-LNP group compared to placebo.  The proportion of 
patients with AEs mapping with the Cardiac failure SMQ was comparable across the groups. Similar results 
were observed in the overall pooled experience. 
Blood pressure 
The proportion of patients with increases and/or decreases in pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic 
blood pressure were similar across the placebo and patisiran-LNP groups.  
Vital signs results were similar in the open-label experience, with no patterns of clinical relevance noted. 
ECG  
No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer studies and the 
Phase 2 study. 
Over the course of Study 004, mean ECG parameters, including QTc interval and all other ECG parameters, 
appeared to be stable, with no clinically relevant changes observed.  Electrocardiogram parameters were 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 146/188 
  
  
similar across the treatment groups in both the safety population and the cardiac subpopulation. No events of 
Torsade de pointes were reported. 
Electrocardiogram results were similar for Study 003, with no patterns of clinical relevance noted.   
In Study 006, ECGs were not collected throughout the study.   
Renal events and kidney function tests 
In Study 004, the proportion of patients with renal AEs using the Acute renal failure SMQ was lower in the 
patisiran-LNP group compared to the placebo group, occurring in 6.1% and 11.7% of patients, respectively.  
Renal AEs observed in ≥2% of patients in the patisiran-LNP group included blood creatinine increased (2.0%) 
and creatinine renal clearance decreased (2.7%).  AEs observed in ≥2% of patients in the placebo group 
included acute kidney injury (5.2%) and proteinuria (3.9%).  
The proportion of patients with serious renal AEs in the SMQ was higher in the placebo group and included 4 
patients (5.2%) with SAEs of acute kidney injury, compared with 1 patient (0.7%) in the patisiran-LNP 
group. All events were considered unlikely or not related to study drug.  In the placebo group, 2 patients 
discontinued study treatment due to SAEs of acute kidney injury, of which one 1 patient  died.  No patient in 
the patisiran LNP group discontinued study treatment due to a renal AE. 
In the overall pooled analysis, the proportion of patients with renal AEs mapping to the Acute renal failure 
SMQ was 5.0%.  Renal AEs observed in 2 or more patients were creatinine renal clearance decreased (4 
patients; 1.8%), blood creatinine increased (3 patients; 1.4%), renal impairment (3 patients; 1.4%), and 
acute kidney injury (2 patients; 0.9%). 
A total of 2 patients in the overall pooled experience had serious renal AEs in the Acute renal failure SMQ:  
the 1 patisiran-LNP treated patient with acute kidney injury from Study 004 and 1 patient with 2 events of 
acute prerenal failure from the 003 Pati/006 Pati group.   
Within the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, there were 2 additional patients with SAEs of chronic kidney 
disease that were reported in Study 006:  1 in a 004 Pbo/006 Pati patient  and 1 in a 004 Pati/006 Pati 
patient.  Both patients had a long history of renal impairment and hATTR amyloidosis. Both patients had 
progression of their disease while in Study 004 and in Study 006.  For the 004 Pati/006 Pati patient, the 
exacerbation of the patient’s chronic renal failure also occurred in the setting of worsening cardiac disease 
with 2 events of atrial fibrillation and worsening congestive heart failure.  Both patients discontinued study 
treatment and withdrew from the study.  In both cases, the results were considered not related to study 
drug.   
Renal Function Parameters over Time 
In Study 004, mean absolute values and mean percent changes from baseline for blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; ( mL/min/1.73 m2) were relatively consistent 
throughout the study in the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups, see Figure 30 below.

In the 2 treatment groups, a similar proportion of patients had worst post-baseline shifts values for BUN and 
creatinine that were high. 
Changes in Renal Function Parameters 
In general, the proportion of patients who had worst post-baseline values for eGFR that were 
<90 mL/min/1.73 m2 was similar between the 2 groups, but there were 5 patients in the patisiran-LNP group 
who had a worst post-baseline shift to <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared with none in the placebo group.  A 
review of the eGFR values for these 5 patients showed that these were very transient shifts in eGFR and that 
subsequent values had returned to the values the patients had at baseline.  Four of the 5 patients were from 
a single site  and the other patient was from another site, but showed the same pattern.  All 5 patients had 
transient, concurrent creatinine values >3 × baseline or >4 mg/dL.  Three of the patients had baseline eGFRs 
of >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 2 patients  had baseline eGFRs of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2.   
A similar proportion of patients in the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups had worst post-baseline shifts of 
eGFRs to 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2, 5 patients (3.4%) and 3 patients (3.9%), respectively.  In the patisiran-
LNP group, 3 of the 5 patients were from the same site and showed the same pattern of transient shifts with 
return to baseline values as noted before.  The other 2 patients had impaired renal function at baseline.  In 
the placebo group, 1 patient had a transient shift with return to baseline as noted above in the patisiran-LNP 
groups.  The other 2 patients had significant impaired renal function at baseline and showed a persistent 
decline in function.  
Results for Study 003 and Study 006 
Renal function results in Study 003 and Study 006 were similar to the placebo-controlled experience.  In 
Study 003, shifts in eGFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73 m2 were observed in 2 
patients (refer to CSR ALN-TTR02-003, Table 14.3.5.12).  In both patients, the shifts were transient, and the 
eGFR values at Week 109 were consistent with those at entry into the study.  Additionally, there was 1 
patient with a baseline eGFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the lowest on-study eGFR level was 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Clinically significant values for renal parameters, including BUN and creatinine, were 
seen in 2 patients. (refer to CSR ALN-TTR02-003, Table 14.3.4.1)   
In Study 006, the majority of patients had worst post-baseline categories that were similar to their baseline 
eGFR category, with a small proportion of patients showing a shift of either 1 category improved or 1 
category worsened.  Of these patients, there were 2 patients, 1 in the 004 placebo group and 1 in the 004 
patisiran-LNP group who had an eGFR of 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline in Study 006 that shifted 1 
category to <15 mL/min/1.73 m2.  At the time of the shift, both patients had a concurrent creatinine values 
>3 × baseline or >4 mg/dL. Both patients had a long history of renal impairment and hATTR amyloidosis.  In 
1 patient, the shift occurred in the setting of worsening of congestive heart failure. Both patients discontinued 
study drug due to worsening of renal impairment.  
Urinalysis 
In Study 003, Study 004, and Study 006, there did not appear to be any pattern of abnormalities in 
urinalyses observed overall.  The majority of patients in all studies had urinalyses that were negative for 
protein.  In the patients who had a urinalysis positive for protein at any time, the majority of the values was 
intermittent and showed no trend.

Ocular 
Patients with hATTR amyloidosis may suffer from disease-related visual impairment due to accumulation of 
amyloid in the vitreous body of the eye. Most of the TTR protein in the body is synthesised by the liver 
(>95%), but the retina also synthesises its own TTR. The production of mutant TTR by the retina may not be 
affected by patisiran treatment, since patisiran targets mainly the liver. Glaucoma and corneal wounds, the 
latter related to dry eyes, are also more common among these patients. Further, TTR reduction in patients 
treated with patisiran-LNP is associated with concomitant reduction in circulating serum levels of RBP and 
vitamin A. Thus, patients were administered ophthalmology exams throughout the studies and an evaluation 
of ocular disorder AEs was conducted. 
During Study 004, the proportion of patients with AEs in the Eye disorder SOC was similar across the 
treatment groups and observed in 27.7% of patients in the patisiran-LNP group and 26.0% of patients in the 
placebo group.  Ocular events reported in 2% or more of patients in either group included cataract, (including 
the PTs cataract, cataract subcapsular, and cataract nuclear) in 7.4% of patients in the patisiran-LNP group 
and 6.5% of the placebo group; conjunctival hemorrhage in 0.7% of patisiran-LNP and 3.9% of placebo 
groups; dry eye, in 4.7% of patisiran-LNP and 2.6% of placebo groups; vision blurred in 2.7% of patisiran-
LNP and 1.3% of placebo groups; and visual acuity reduced in 0.7% of patisiran-LNP and 2.6% of placebo 
groups.   
In the overall pooled analysis, 61 (28.0%) patients reported AEs in the Eye disorders SOC.  The type of 
ocular events reported were consistent with those expected in the general hATTR amyloidosis patient 
population. Ocular events reported in ≥2% of patients were cataract (5.5%), dry eye (3.7%), and vision 
blurred (2.3%). 
Overall, in both the placebo-controlled study (Study 004) and the pooled patisiran-LNP experience, the type 
of ocular AEs reported was consistent with those expected in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and was 
consistent with the age of the patients in the study.  ERG results were similar across the treatment groups 
and studies and were not suggestive of vitamin A deficiency. 
In the placebo-controlled Study 004, evaluations of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, visual field deviation, 
slit lamp biomicroscopy, and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy were performed.  No clinically notable trends 
were observed in the patisiran-LNP or placebo groups.  Mean values of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, 
and visual field deviation remained stable over the course of the study in both treatment groups.  Overall, 
few patients had clinically significant findings in slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy 
results over the course of the study for both treatment groups; of the patients who had clinically significant 
findings, the findings appeared to be transient.  Electroretinography results remained stable over the course 
of the study for both treatment groups.  
Mean intraocular pressure remained stable over the course of the study for both treatment groups, and no 
patient had a value <5 or >30 mm Hg during the study  Mean visual field mean deviation results remained 
stable over the course of the study for both treatment groups. 
Ophthalmology results were similar in the open-label experience, with few and transient abnormal findings 
observed.  Electroretinography was not collected in Study 003.  Electroretinography was protocol-mandated 
in Study 004 but was only collected as clinically indicated in Study 006.  Electroretinography results in Study 
004 remained normal over the course of the study for both treatment groups.  In 2 patients in Study 006 
with ERG results, there were no clinically significant findings.

Thyroid 
Transthyretin is a minor transporter of thyroxine in humans.  In patisiran-LNP nonclinical studies, expected 
pharmacologic decreases in total thyroxine (up to 50%) were observed.  Thus, an evaluation of thyroid 
related events was conducted.  
Overall, the proportion of patients with hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders was low and consistent 
with those expected in patients with hATTR amyloidosis.  There was no safety concern considered related to 
treatment with patisiran-LNP. 
Thyroid parameters 
In Study 004, mean absolute values and mean percent change from baseline for thyroid parameters were 
relatively consistent and remained proportionate throughout the study in both the patisiran-LNP and placebo 
groups.  
Results for thyroid evaluations in Study 003 and Study 006 were similar to the placebo-controlled experience.   
Malignancies 
Patisiran-LNP is considered to have a low risk for carcinogenicity in humans based on its mechanism of 
action.  In nonclinical studies, there was no evidence of any carcinogenic or genotoxic potential.  As the 
median age at entry into Study 004 was 62 years of age, a comprehensive search was performed based on 
the subordinate SMQ of Malignant or unspecified tumors under the SMQ of Malignancies to identify potential 
malignant neoplasms.  Each identified case was medically reviewed to validate the presence of a malignancy 
based on case details.  
In Study 004, a total of 7 patients reported malignancies, 3 (2.0%) in the patisiran-LNP group and 4 (5.2%) 
in the placebo group; none of these cases were considered related to study treatment by the applicant. Of 
the 3 patients in the patisiran-LNP group with malignancies, 2 patients with a medical history of malignant 
skin neoplasms (basal cell carcinoma and atypical fibroxanthoma) had recurrences of their neoplasms.  The 
third patient had a newly diagnosed case of bladder cancer that resolved on treatment.   
Of the 4 patients in the placebo group with malignancies, 2 patients had malignant skin neoplasms (basal cell 
carcinoma and malignant melanoma in situ), and 3 patients had solid organ malignancies (2 colon cancers 
and 1 prostate cancer). One of the patients  with metastatic colorectal cancer had a prior history of Stage 3 
colon cancer.  This patient died due to metastatic disease.  The other patient had a poor prognosis and was 
receiving palliative chemotherapy. 
Overall in the pooled analysis, 10 patients (4.6%) reported malignancies (Table 36).  There were 3 patients 
with malignancies in Study 004 (noted above), 2 patients with malignancies in Study 003, and 8 patients 
with malignancies in Study 006 of whom 3 had prior malignancies in Study 004.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
In the placebo-controlled study (Study 004), SAEs occurred in 36.5% of the patisiran-LNP group and 40.3% 
of the placebo group. Differences in the SAE profile between the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups that 
occurred with a ≥5 percentage point difference by SOC were infections and infestations (5.4% patisiran-LNP; 
11.7% placebo), metabolism and nutrition disorders (2.7% patisiran-LNP; 7.8% placebo) and renal and 
urinary disorders (patisiran-LNP 0.7%; placebo 6.5%).  The proportion of patients with cardiac SAEs was 
similar between the patisiran-LNP (13.5%) and placebo (13.0%) treatment groups.  
In the patisiran-LNP group, SAEs reported in ≥2% of patients included diarrhea (5.4%), atrioventricular block 
complete, cardiac failure, cardiac failure congestive, pneumonia and orthostatic hypotension (reported in 
2.0% each).  All other SAEs were reported in <2% of patients.  
Diarrhea was reported as an SAE in 8 patients (5.4%) in the patisiran-LNP group and 1 patient (1.3%) in the 
placebo group.  The majority of the diarrhea SAEs (6 events in 5 patients) in the patisiran group occurred at 
one study site; at this site, the standard of care for diarrhea treatment mandates that patients are 
hospitalization for the initiation of anti-diarrheal medications, such as sandostatin.  All the SAEs of diarrhea 
resolved in all affected patients in both treatment groups, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation.  In

one patient (in the patisiran-LNP group), diarrhea was considered possibly related to study treatment; in all 
other patients, it was considered unlikely or not related. 
In the placebo group, SAEs reported in ≥2% of patients were acute kidney injury and urinary tract infection 
(both reported in 5.2%); dehydration, pneumonia and vomiting (reported in 3.9% each); cardiac failure, 
cardiac failure congestive, constipation, hereditary neuropathic amyloidosis, hyponatremia, and pneumonia 
aspiration (reported in 2.6% each).  All other SAEs were reported in <2% of patients. 
In the overall pooled patisiran-LNP experience, SAEs occurred in 40.4% of patients. System organ classes 
with a frequency of SAEs of ≥5% were cardiac disorders (17.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (7.3%), 
infections and infestations (6.4%), and vascular disorders (5.5%). SAEs reported in ≥2% of patients were 
diarrhea (4.1%), cardiac amyloidosis (2.3%), cardiac failure (2.3%), and cardiac failure congestive (2.3%). 
An additional analysis of all SAEs that resulted in hospitalization and/or death for any cause was performed. A 
total of 50 patients (33.8%) in the patisiran-LNP group and 30 patients (39%) in the placebo group had at 
least 1 hospitalization and/or death for any cause, with mean number of events of 1.4 in the patisiran-LNP 
group and 2.3 in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with 2 or more hospitalizations was lower in 
the patisiran-LNP group than the placebo group. The rate of hospitalizations and/or death for any cause was 
lower in the patisiran-LNP group (35.2 per 100 patient-years) than in the placebo group (72.8 per 100 
patient-years).  
Deaths 
In total, there were 21 deaths reported in the patisiran development programme, all of which occurred in 
hATTR patients participating in the pivotal studies 003, 004 and 006. 
None of the 21 deaths was considered related to study treatment by the investigators. 
The 21 deaths reported in patisiran-LNP clinical studies were evaluated by an external, independent 
adjudication committee to classify whether the deaths were of cardiovascular (CV), non-cardiovascular (non-
CV), or unknown origin. 
The majority of deaths were cardiovascular in nature and consistent with those expected in this patient 
population.  As further described below, the overall mortality observed in patisiran-treated patients was at 
the low-end of the range reported in literature for hATTR patients, including those with less severe disease.  
The majority of patients in both treatment groups also had known risk factors for poor prognosis, which can 
include increasing age, history or diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, non-Val30Met genotype (eg, Thr60Ala, 
Val122Ile, Glu89Gln), Val30Met genotype with late onset disease (>50 years), increased N-terminal pro b-
type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, increased interventricular septum (IVS) thickness, poor diastolic 
function, as well as increased left ventricular posterior wall thickness and left atrial diameter, among others.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology  
The non-clinical and clinical experience so far with therapeutic oligonucleotides (mainly of the ASO (DNA-
based) class) has shown that these may affect haematology values due to immune stimulation. 
In Study 004, in the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups, mean hematology values for red blood cell 
parameters (including mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration, and corpuscular volume [MCV]) were generally stable and throughout the course of the study.  
Mean platelet parameters (including platelet counts and mean platelet volume) were also stable in both the 
patisiran-LNP and placebo groups throughout the course of the study. No patients had platelet counts <50 
x109/L (CTCAE Grade 3).  One patient in the patisiran-LNP group had a transient mild AE of 
thrombocytopenia. In the placebo group, 1 patient had a transient moderate AE of thrombocytopenia and 1 
patient had a mild AE of platelet count decreased (intermittent, not recovered/resolved). 
Certain other laboratory tests—namely, WBC, eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil 
counts were expected to show the effects of corticosteroids administered as premedication approximately 12 
hours before baseline laboratory sample collection. 
Overall, as anticipated, there was some effect of corticosteroid administration on mean values for the various 
WBC parameters such as lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and WBCs.  At the Day 252 study visit, 
absolute mean lymphocyte, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes counts showed a decreased from baseline.  
At the Day 546 study visit, the corticosteroid effect was less pronounced, and values were trending back to 
baseline at the end of the study.  The inverse pattern was seen with neutrophils and WBC, which showed 
some increase from baseline at the Day 252 study visit, and trended back to baseline at the end of the study.  
As all patients received premedication, a similar pattern was seen in the placebo group.  Beyond the effect of 
corticosteroids, the treatment with patisiran-LNP did not appear to have an additional effect on hematology 
values, as the values were similar to the placebo group. 
Results for hematology evaluations in Study 003 and Study 006 were similar to the placebo-controlled 
experience.  In Study 003, 2 patients had hemoglobin values of <100 g/L:  1 patient with a transient Grade 4 
decrease and 1 patient with a Grade 2 decrease.  A total of 5 patients had at least 1 lymphocyte count 
<0.5 ×109/L (Grade 3).  The Grade 3 shifts in lymphocyte counts were transient and consistent with 
glucocorticoid administration.   
In Study 006, a total of 7 patients had at least 1 hemoglobin value of <100 g/L, all were Grade 1 or 2 except 
for 1 patient  in the 004 patisiran-LNP group had a Grade 3 value in hemoglobin.    The patient had a 
decreased hemoglobin value of 79 g/L (Grade 3) at baseline in Study 006.  The patient’s hemoglobin was 
stable and increased during Study 006 with a value of 89 g/L at Week 52.  The low hemoglobin was not 
considered an AE and was part of the patient’s medical history; in Study 004, the patient had an ongoing AE 
of worsening anemia that started on Day 71 that was considered not related to study drug.  All values for 7 
patients were either transient or stable with respect to the patients’ baselines values. 
In Study 006, a total of 7 patients had at least 1 post-baseline lymphocyte count of <0.8 × 109/L (Grade 2), 
of which 1 patient in the 003 patisiran-LNP group had a single lymphocyte count of <0.5 × 109/L (Grade 3).  
In general, these Grade 2 and Grade 3 lymphocyte counts were transient and consistent with the timing of

administration of corticosteroids  There was 1 patient in the 004 placebo group with a single neutrophil count 
<1.5 × 109/L (Grade 2) and WBC count <3.0 × 109/L (Grade 2) at Week 12.  There was 1 patient in the 004 
placebo group who had a single platelet count <75 × 109/L (Grade 2).    
Coagulation parameters 
The non-clinical and clinical experience so far with therapeutic oligonucleotides (mainly of the ASO (DNA-
based) class) has shown that these may lead to inhibition of the coagulation cascade. 
In Study 004, mean coagulation parameters appeared to be stable over the course of the study and generally 
similar for both the patisiran-LNP and placebo groups.  There were no Grade 3 or Grade 4 shifts in activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or prothrombin time during the study.  
Similar results for coagulation parameters were observed in Study 003 and Study 006.  In Study 003, 2 
patients had clinically significant elevated coagulation parameter levels (1 patient had clinically significant 
aPTT and prothrombin International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels and 1 patient had clinically significant 
prothrombin time, aPTT, and INR levels).  In Study 006, no patients had prothrombin time values that were 
Grade 3 or 4. 
Complement 
“Class” or platform-related effects such as activation of C’ alternative complement pathway and immune 
stimulation have been described for other therapeutic oligonucleotides (mainly of the ASO (DNA-based) 
class). 
Complement factors were analysed in the single-dose dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers (study 001) 
and in the open-label dose-escalation study in patients with TTR amyloidosis (study 002), in which each 
patient received two doses 4 or 3 weeks apart. 
Transient increases (up to 7-fold) in complement factor Bb were observed from 30 min to 2 h post-dose from 
the 50 µg/kg dose, and had returned to baseline within 24 h. There were no associated clinical signs or AEs. 
Cytokines and CRP 
Cytokines were analysed in the single-dose dose-escalation study in healthy volunteers (study 001) and in 
the open-label dose-escalation study in patients with TTR amyloidosis (study 002), in which each patient 
received two doses 4 or 3 weeks apart. 
No substantial changes were observed in any dose groups for the following cytokines: G-CSF, IFN-α, IFN-γ, 
IL-1b, and IL-12. Minor transient increases in mean IL-6, IL-1RA, IP-10, and TNF-α levels were seen after the 
second dose for some dose groups. Of note, most time points, cytokine values were below the lower limit of 
detection for most patients.  
In study 001, mean CRP remained relatively constant through 6 hours post infusion. Twenty-four hours after 
the infusion, slight increases were observed in the 3 highest doses of ALN-TTR02 (150, 300, and 500 μg/kg); 
placebo and the 10 and 50 μg/kg cohorts remained constant throughout the study. 
In study 002, notable changes from baseline in CRP levels included a 14.1-fold increase seen 24 hours after 
the second infusion (Day 28) in the 300 μg/kg (Q4W) dose group and a 10.2-fold increase seen 24 hours 
after the second infusion (Day 21) in the 300 μg/kg (Q3W) dose group. The changes in CRP were transient 
and not associated with TEAEs. No clear dose-related changes in CRP were observed. The increases in CRP 
are of unclear clinical significance.

Cytokines were neither analysed in the pivotal study 004, nor in the extension studies 003 and 006.

product was used for the assessment of immunogenicity in human serum. The validated cut-points were 
established based on serum from a healthy donor population rather from patisiran-LNP patient specific sera.  
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was 3.4% (5 of 148 patients) in the patisiran-LNP group and 
1.30% (1 of 77 patients) in the placebo group. In the 5 patients with ADA in the patisiran-LNP group, ADA 
titers were low and ranged from 40 to 80. In the placebo group, ADA titers ranged from 40 to 160. In 
general, ADA was transient with all patients in both treatment groups testing negative for ADA after Week 36 
(Day 252). In the patisiran-LNP group, the patients with positive ADA status had a similar pattern of AEs as 
that observed in the overall population. There is no evidence to suggest an association between ADA and 
IRRs, anaphylactic reactions, or hypersensitivity events. Overall, a positive ADA status did not appear to 
affect the safety profiles of patisiran-LNP in Study 004.  
In Study 003, 1 of 27 patients treated with patisiran-LNP had a positive ADA result. This patient tested 
positive for ADA at baseline and at several sampling time points up to Week 13. Baseline ADA positivity was 
likely to due to exposure to patisiran-LNP in the parent Study ALN-TTR02-002. There was no impact of ADA 
on the PK, PD, or safety profiles of patisiran-LNP.   
None of the patients in Study 006 had a confirmed positive ADA result during the study.  
Safety in special populations 
The cardiac subgroup 
The proportions of patients experiencing AEs and SAEs in the cardiac subpopulation were similar to those in 
the study population as a whole.  In the cardiac subpopulation, the proportion of patients with AEs was 
similar between the patisiran-LNP (95.6%) and placebo (97.2%) groups, and the proportion of patients with 
SAEs was lower in the patisiran-LNP group (34.4%) group compared with the placebo (50.0%) group. 
In study 004, 5 of the 90 (5.6%) patients in the patisiran-LNP cardiac subpopulation group and 4 of the 36 
(11.1%) patients in the placebo cardiac subpopulation group died. 
In the overall pooled experience, a total of 10 of 124 patients (8.1%) in the cardiac subpopulation died over 
a cumulative period of observation of 220.8 patient-years. 
Age, sex, weight, race, genotype (V30M or non-V30M mutation), FAP stage  
No clinically meaningful differences. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnant or lactating women were excluded from participation in all clinical studies, and women of 
childbearing potential were required to use acceptable methods of birth control throughout the study.  As of 
the data cutoff date for Study 006of 14 July 2017, there have been no reported pregnancies in the patisiran-
LNP clinical development program.  Thus, the effect of patisiran LNP on pregnancy and lactation in humans is 
unknown.

Expanded access program in the US 
An open-label EAP, under Protocol ALN-TTR02-007 [Study 007]) is currently ongoing in the United States; it 
is designed to allow patients with hATTR amyloidosis to receive patisiran-LNP.  Patients in Study 007 are 
receiving patisiran-LNP at the dose and regimen proposed in labeling, including the proposed premedication 
regimen. 
As of the data cutoff date of 14 July 2017, 48 patients were treated in Study 007.  The mean age of patients 
at screening was 63.8 years (range 41-81 years), 81.3% were male, and 97.9% were White/Caucasian.  
Patients with at least 16 different TTR mutations have been enrolled, with the majority having non-V30M 
genotypes (79.2%).  Baseline PND scores ranged from 0 to IIIB, with approximately half being earlier stages 
(PND score 0 [2.1%], I [41.7%], II [12.5%]) and half being later stages (PND score IIIA [25.0%] and IIIB 
[18.8%]).  
The mean duration of patisiran-LNP exposure was 87.3 days (range, 21 to 191).  The mean number of doses 
received was 4.1 (range, 1 to 9), with 19 patients (39.6%), receiving at least 3 to 6 months of patisiran-LNP 
dosing.  Cumulative study drug exposure was 11.5 patient-years.  
The proportion of patients with AEs was 43.8%.  Adverse events that were reported in ≥5% of patients were 
restless legs syndrome (8.3%; 4 patients) and headache (6.3%, 3 patients).  
The total of 6 (10.4%) of patients reported IRRs (reported as an IRR or as individual symptoms) Symptoms 
included facial oedema; dysphonia; flushing; pain in the back, neck, shoulder, hip, or body; fatigue; and 
peripheral edema. All were mild or moderate in severity except for one case with facial swelling and hoarse 
voice.  Two patients had IRRs that led to discontinuation of patisiran-LNP (1 prior to the data cutoff and 1 
after). 
No deaths have been reported in Study 007.  Six patients experienced SAEs.  There were no SAEs by PT that 
were reported in more than one patient.  Serious AEs in 2 of the patients with SAEs were assessed by the 
Investigators as possibly related to study drug (the IRR with facial swelling and a hoarse voice and .an SAE of 
small intestinal obstruction. 
In addition, 2 patients had malignancies (malignant melanoma in situ and metastatic pancreatic carcinoma 
with mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene) that were categorized as SAEs.  
Overall, the open-label data available to date in EAP Study 007 suggest a consistent safety profile with that 
observed in the clinical studies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study 
In Study 004, a total of 7 (4.7%) patients in the patisiran-LNP group and 11 patients (14.3%) in the placebo 
group reported AEs that led to treatment discontinuation.  AEs leading to treatment discontinuation reported 
in 2 or more patients were cardiac failure (2 patients, 1.4%) in the patisiran-LNP group and acute kidney 
injury (2 patients, 2.6%) in the placebo group.  In both treatment groups, all other AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were reported in 1 patient each. 
All patients who discontinued study treatment due to an AE also withdrew from the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 166/188 
  
  
A total of 13 (6.0%) patients across the overall pooled experience reported an AE leading to discontinuation 
of patisiran-LNP and study withdrawal.  The only AE leading to discontinuation of patisiran-LNP and study 
withdrawal reported in 2 or more patients was cardiac failure (2 patients, 0.9%) as noted above in Study 
004. All other AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 1 patient by preferred term. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Based on the mechanism of action, i.e. reduction of both mutated and wild-type TTR produced by the liver, 
treatment with patisiran may lead to reduced levels of vitamin A, which may result in night blindness and 
retinal dystrophy. In addition, TTR can also (in addition to thyroid binding globulin) serve as a carrier for 
thyroxine (T4), thus thyroid hormone levels were analysed in the development programme.  
In general, the non-clinical and clinical experience so far with therapeutic oligonucleotides (mainly of the ASO 
(DNA-based) class) has shown that these may lead to adverse effects related to immune stimulation, 
activation of C’ alternative pathway and inhibition of the coagulation cascade, as well as tissue accumulation 
in the liver, kidneys, spleen and lymph nodes. 
Patisiran is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LPN) in the circulation. Non-clinical studies have shown that 
the toxicity primarily is related to the liposomal formulation and not to the siRNA itself. 
The safety database includes 218 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy exposed to patisiran-
LNP. 179 patients have been dosed for at least 12 months and 101 for at least 24 months. In addition, 48 
patients have been exposed in an expanded access program in the US. Overall, the safety database is small, 
but taking into consideration the rarity of the disease, it is considered acceptable. 
The studies that were selected for the integrated safety analysis used the intended therapeutic dose, dosing 
interval, and infusion rate. In addition, all patients, including those randomised to placebo, received the same 
infusion premedication. Two different premedication regimens were applied during the clinical studies, the 
original (premedication 12 h and 60 min prior to infusion) and the reduced premedication (only 60 min prior 
to infusion) regimens. The reduced premedication regimen is proposed to be used in clinical practice. 
In the clinical studies, patients were instructed to take an oral supplemental dose of 2,500 IU per day of 
vitamin A (corresponding to approximately 833 retinol equivalents (RE) per day). This recommendation is 
appropriately reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 and a statement on the recommended dose of 2,500 IU of Vit 
A is provided.  
AEs 
The overall proportion of patients experiencing AEs was similar in the patisiran (96.6%) and the placebo 
(97.4%) groups. 
The ADRs for the tabulated list of ADRs in SmPC 4.8 were selected based on the following three criteria:  
either TEAEs + relatedness + more common in patisiran group  
• 
•  OR related to the mechanism of action  
•  OR at least 3 percentage point higher frequency in patisiran than placebo. 
IRRs fulfilled all these criteria. All other listed ADRs were based on criterion c. above, i.e. at least 3 
percentage points higher frequency in the patisiran group. There were a number of potential ADRs (asthenia, 
dizziness, UTI) that were dismissed due to lower frequency in the patisiran group. Erythema was related AEs 
with a 2 percentage point difference and overall AEs with a 4.2 percentage point difference and was also 
included. 
Upper respiratory tract infections were reported with more than 3 percentage points higher frequency and 
thus were included in spite of no obvious clinical or pharmacological reason explaining why patisiran 
treatment would lead to these infections.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 167/188 
  
  
 
In contrast, there were some AEs with a higher frequency in the placebo group compared to the patisiran 
group (fall, nausea, pain in extremity, muscular weakness, urinary tract infection, syncope, anaemia), that 
probably reflected the higher disease activity in these patients. 
Since the non-clinical and clinical experience so far with therapeutic oligonucleotides (mainly of the ASO 
(DNA-based) class) has shown that these may lead to class  and platform related adverse effects which 
include immune stimulation, siRNA formulated as a lipid nanoparticle is directed to the liver, the heart and 
kidneys are affected by hATTR amyloidosis and the reduction of serum TTR leads to a risk for thyroid-related 
AEs through effects on retinol (vitamin A) and TTR is a minor transporter of thyroxine, the following AEs are 
considered AEs of special interest for patisiran treatment: IRR, liver, cardiac, renal, ocular and thyroid. 
Infusion-related reactions and premedication 
Infusion-related reactions were more common in the patisiran (18.9%) than in the placebo (9.1%) group. All 
IRRs were mild to moderate and resolved. In addition the IRRs are considered as an identified risk and 
reflected accordingly in the RMP. 
Flushing occurred in both groups and was the most common IRR in the placebo group. This was considered 
probably related to the use of premedication.  
Events potentially related to extravasation have been reported in 0.3% of infusions and symptoms consist of 
phlebitis, localized pain, burning sensation, swelling, tenderness, or redness at or near the infusion site. 
In the patisiran group, amongst the patients reporting IRRs, the majority (78.6%) had their first IRR 
reported during the first 2 dose administrations and 82.1% by the third dose. In the open-label extension 
study 006, home infusions were permitted for patients in certain regions after the dose was administered in 
the clinic at least 3 times with no IRRs or other AEs observed. Home administration of premedication and 
infusion has been successfully performed in 25 patients and a cumulative total of 269 doses of patisiran-LNP 
in the open label extension study 006. In order to be a candidate for home infusion in Study 006, patients 
had to tolerate 3 infusions in the clinic without any infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or other adverse effects 
and be considered suitable for home infusion by their treating physician (based on the physician’s clinical 
judgment). All infusions were administered in full without dose interruptions due to an IRR or a complication 
with premedication. Of the 25 patients, 24 patients have had no IRRs reported during the home infusions. 
One patient had mild symptoms (primarily flushing) that did not require any specific medical treatment. It is 
considered that home infusions are feasible when given by health care personnel who have received 
appropriate instructions. The instructions received in the study were similar to those included in the proposed 
SmPC. Section 4.2 of the SmPC recommends that the patient should have tolerated at least 3 infusions in the 
clinic before they can receive home infusions. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
While infusion reactions can produce signs that are observable, patients may experience subjective 
symptoms that are not immediately observable by a health care professional (HCP), for example dizziness, 
chest pain, nausea or back pain. In addition, in the event of an infusion reaction occurring in a geographically 
remote location, it will be important for it to be recognised and managed swiftly. Patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis may be frail, and they are notably also often elderly. Therefore, the CHMP considered that it 
would be helpful and prudent for patients to have immediately to hand a concise, focussed educational 
material detailing signs and symptoms that may indicate an infusion reaction is occurring and the advice to 
inform the HCP immediately should one occur, in order to mitigate any delay in implementing management. 
This would facilitate safe, and sustainable, home infusions in the post-marketing setting, which would benefit 
patients. 
AEs deemed related to the premedication by the investigators were mainly related to corticosteroid treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 168/188 
  
  
 
 
 
and these AEs appeared to decrease in frequency once the reduced premedication regimen was introduced in 
the clinical trials. The applicant presented data suggesting that corticosteroid-related AEs didn’t increase over 
time during long-term treatment with patisiran. It was noted that the reduced premedication included 10 mg 
dexamethasone every 3 weeks which raised the concern that such premedication regimen may lead to 
adverse effects related to long-term corticosteroid treatment. Long-term adverse effects of repeated use of 
high-dose corticosteroids as premedication may be a safety concern in patients with manifest diabetes or 
osteoporosis. Therefore the applicant proposed to decrease corticosteroid posology in patients to a minimal 
dose of 5 mg of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent for patients who well tolerated their patisiran 
infusions.  This risk minimisation measure was welcomed by the CHMP and it was considered that it alleviates 
the long term safety concerns related to long-term use of corticosteroids. 
Vitamin A 
Serum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein, which facilitates transport of vitamin A in the blood. 
Treatment with patisiran reduces serum TTR levels, which results in reduced levels of retinol binding protein 
and vitamin A in the serum. However, the transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur through 
alternative mechanisms in the absence of retinol binding protein. As a result, laboratory tests for serum 
vitamin A do not reflect the total amount of vitamin A in the body and should not be used to guide vitamin A 
supplementation during treatment with patisiran. No negative findings, such as ocular toxicity, related to 
lower vitamin A levels have been observed in the clinical trials. However, a warning about the ocular signs 
and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and recommendation for referral for ophthalmological assessment if 
such symptoms occur have been added to section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The liver 
The liver is an organ of interest for safety reasons, since patisiran-LNP specifically targets the liver and 
nonclinical studies of patisiran-LNP revealed changes in serum liver markers and liver histopathology. In the 
MAD  study (study 002), a transient increase in AST and ALT was seen during the first 14 days only in dose 
group 300 μg/kg Q3W, peaking at day 7, which normalised by day 14. This observation indicates that liver 
transaminases are affected acutely by patisiran-LNP treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In study 004, 
there was a trend for slightly elevated ALT (26.4% vs 13.0% >ULN and ≤3xULN), AST (20.9% vs 5.2% 
>ULN and ≤3xULN) and total bilirubin (6.1% vs 2.6%, >ULN and ≤1.5xULN) in the patisiran group vs the 
placebo group in the pivotal study 004. There were no Hy’s Law cases observed (AST or ALT >3 × ULN and 
total bilirubin >2 × ULN). A small initial increase from baseline in AST and ALT compared to placebo was 
observed in study 004, but this increase remained stable over the 18 months of the placebo-controlled study. 
The applicant presented data showing that no clinically meaningful changes in liver function tests appear to 
occur with patisiran-LNP treatment relative to placebo for up to 18 months of treatment (study 004) and ALT 
and AST levels continued to remain stable in the open label study (study 006) for up to 49.5 months. No 
changes in APL or total bilirubin were observed. In the open label study 003, the percentage of increases in 
AST or ALT (>ULN and <3x ULN) during patisiran-LNP treatment was very similar to that in study 004 
(33.3% vs 31.8%). Therefore the CHMP considered that no monitoring of liver function is warranted during 
treatment with patisiran-LNP. In addition the monitoring of hepatic events would be warranted during the 
ongoing open label study (006) and the planned prospective observational cohort study.    
The heart 
In hATTR, amyloid is accumulated in the heart tissue, leading to arrhythmias and congestive heart failure. 
Thus, cardiac AEs were expected in this patient population. The proportion of patients with AEs (28.4% 
patisiran; 36.4% placebo) and SAEs (13.5% patisiran; 13.0% placebo) within the Cardiac disorders SOC was 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 169/188 
  
  
 
 
 
similar across the 2 treatment groups. Efficacy data indicate that treatment with patisiran inhibits the 
amyloidosis-related increase in left ventricular wall thickness and disease-related increase in NT-proBNP 
values. The cardiac safety data points in the same direction:  
- The rate of hospitalizations or deaths in the Cardiac SOC was lower in the patisiran group compared to 
placebo (9.6/100 PYs for patisiran vs 15.6/100 PYs for placebo)  
- A lower proportion of patients who had cardiac arrhythmias in the patisiran group (18.9% vs 28.6% in the 
placebo group). 
The kidneys 
hATTR disease-related amyloid accumulation in the kidneys lead to proteinuria and ultimately to renal failure. 
In contrast to ASOs, siRNA is not distributed to the kidneys and 90% of the patisiran-LNP dose is observed in 
the liver post-dose according to findings in non-clinical studies. In non-clinical toxicology studies, no findings 
related to the kidney related toxicity were observed. 
The frequency of renal events observed in the clinical studies was lower in the patisiran-treated patients 
compared to placebo-treated patients and the types of events were consistent with those expected in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis. In study 004, creatinine, BUN and estimated GFR remained stable over the 
entire 18 months treatment period. 
The eyes 
Eye disorders in patients with hATTR are known. Hence around half of patients, in both groups in study 004, 
had ocular diseases reported in their medical history. However, TTR reduction during patisiran treatment can 
equally lead to reduction of circulating serum level of retinol binding protein and vitamin A. 
In the placebo-controlled study, no difference between the treatment arms was observed in patients 
reporting at least an AE in SOC eye disorders. Analysis per preferred term (PT) showed that a higher 
percentage of patients in the patisiran group reported AEs such as dry eye (4.7% vs 2.6%) and vision blurred 
(2.7% vs 1.3%).  
No safety signal related to visual disorders, including visual impairment, visual acuity reduced or vision 
blurred, was observed in patients exposed to patisiran in clinical trials which could be attributed to vitamin A 
deficiency. However, as ocular changes can occur in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and it is important to 
assess if these changes could potentially be related to vitamin A deficiency. Therefore  a warning about the 
ocular signs and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and recommendation for referral for ophthalmological 
assessment if such symptoms occur have been included in SmPC section 4.4. In addition the CHMP 
considered that the warning should also give examples of ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency 
such as: reduced night vision or night blindness, persistent dry eyes, eye inflammation, corneal inflammation 
or ulceration, corneal thickening, corneal perforation.  
Of note, cataract nuclear, eye irritation, keratitis and visual impairment were reported in two patients both in 
the patisiran arm whereas there is no patient reported these events in the placebo group. Three SAEs in SOC 
Eye disorders were reported in patients treated with patisiran, all in study 004: including maculopathy, 
vitreous hemorrhage, and vitreous opacities.  
Ophthalmology testing results remained stable in both treatment groups over the course of the study, 
indicating that ocular disease-related progression is slow. However, the probability that patisiran may halter 
the disease-related visual impairment due to accumulation of amyloid in the vitreous body of the eye is 
considered low, since patisiran mainly targets the TTR production of the liver and the retina synthesises its 
own TTR. 
Thyroid parameters  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 170/188 
  
  
 
 
 
TTR is a minor transporter of thyroxine (T4). In patisiran nonclinical studies decreases in total T4 up to 50% 
were noted.  However, in the clinical programme, no changes in thyroid parameters or thyroid disorders were 
observed. 
Malignancies 
The mechanism of action of patisiran doesn’t suggest the risk for an increase in malignancies. In the 
nonclinical studies, there was no evidence of any carcinogenic or genotoxic potential. The types and rates of 
malignancies observed were consistent with the ones reported in the general population of the same age as 
included in the studies and malignancies were not more common in the patisiran arm compared to placebo. 
SAEs including deaths 
Frequencies of SAEs were comparable between patisiran- and placebo-treated patients. Most SAEs were 
events to be expected in the patient population due to the background disease. A few SAEs in the patisiran 
group (post-infusion cellulitis/superficial thrombophlebitis, dermatitis, procedure extravasation) were related 
to extravasation of the drug. 
The prognosis and mortality risk in hATTR is related to the genetic mutation: among the three most common 
genetic variants, V30M mutation has less cardiac involvement and a better prognosis, whereas V122I and 
T60A mutations have a worse prognosis (Adelaide et al. (2013) Genotype, echocardiography, and survival in 
familial transthyretin amyloidosis. Amyloid, 20:4, 263-268). The most common death cause in patients with 
hATTR is cardiac related (cardiac failure, MI, arrhythmias, ischaemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation) and other 
common causes of death are renal failure, infection and cachexia. 
Even though patients were subdivided into cardiac and non-cardiac subgroups, based on a cut-off for left 
ventricle wall thickness of 13 mm, many patients who didn’t belong to the cardiac subgroup had a medical 
history of cardiac disease including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia-related problems. 
In total, there were 21 deaths reported in the patisiran development programme: 15 deaths in patisiran-
treated patients and 6 in placebo-treated patients. During the placebo-controlled study 004, there were 7 
(4.7%) deaths in the patisiran arm and 6 (7.8%) deaths in the placebo arm. During the open-label studies 
003 and 006 there were an additional 7 deaths in patisiran-treated patients. 14 of the 21 patients who died 
were allocated to the cardiac subgroup at baseline. However, based on the existence of a medical history of 
cardiac disease, 18 out of the 21 patients who died had some degree of cardiac disease before death. 
The SAEs reported as fatal were adjudicated to the cardiovascular (CV) subgroup in 12 out of 15 of the 
patisiran-treated patients and in 3 out of 6 of the placebo-treated patients. Of note, of the 3 cardiovascular 
deaths in the placebo-group, 1 was adjudicated as related to heart failure and two rather to cerebrovascular 
than cardiovascular events, since both were fatal strokes (one hemorrhagic, one ischaemic). However, 
ischaemic stroke is often caused by atrial fibrillation related to cardiac amyloidosis in hATTR patients. Non-CV 
fatal SAEs were esophageal carcinoma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (parainfluenza), and invasive 
ductal breast carcinoma in patisiran-treated patients and staphylococcal sepsis, metastatic colorectal cancer 
and one case adjudicated as unknown (UTI & acute kidney failure) in placebo-treated patients.  
Five other patients died after the cut-off date: 4 patients treated with patisiran in study 006 (reported cause 
of death: arrhythmia, electrolyte imbalance/acute respiratory failure cardiopulmonary failure, and unknown) 
and one patient who received placebo (cause of death: worsening cardiac failure).  
Despite sudden death imbalance between groups in study 004 with more sudden deaths reported in patients 
treated with patisiran, these cases could be related to cardiomyopathy due to hATTR. Provided 
electrocardiograms highlight abnormalities observed in patients with severe amyloidosis in all these cases.  
Two deaths cases with haemorrhage (subarachnoidal and gastrointestinal, respectively) were reported in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 171/188 
  
  
 
 
 
placebo group, both adjudicated to the CV subgroup. Haemorrhage is an adverse event that has occurred in 
patients with thrombocytopenia treated with other therapeutic oligonucleotides and thus interesting to 
analyse. However, since these deaths occurred in the placebo group, they were not related to treatment with 
patisiran. 
The death rates in the pivotal study and overall pooled experience were compared to reported death rates 
from other studies in the hATTR patient population. Since risk factors for poor prognosis include the non-
V30M genotype and the proportion of non-V30M was 57.3% in the pivotal study 004, which is similar to the 
proportion of non-V30M in the tafamidis (53%) and diflunisal trials (45%), it was agreed with the applicant 
that death rates per 100 patient-years (PY) are comparable with the rates reported in the tafamidis and 
diflunisal studies. The overall death rate in the patisiran group of study 004 was 3.2/100 PY and 6.4/100 PY 
in the placebo group. The overall death rate in the long-term treatment study of tafamidis was 6.6/100 PY, 
and in the placebo-controlled diflunisal study it was 3.1/100 PY in the diflunisal group and 6.8/100 PY in the 
placebo group. Thus, the death rates are comparable between these studies. 
Haematology and coagulation parameters 
There were minor effects on haematology parameters, which occurred in both treatment groups which could 
be related to corticosteroid premedication prior to blood sampling in the study. No effects on coagulation 
parameters were observed. 
Complement factors and cytokines/CRP 
Activations of the alternative complement pathway and immune stimulation have been described for other 
therapeutic oligonucleotides (mainly of the ASO (DNA-based) class). In the non-clinical and dose-response 
clinical studies, transient effects were seen on both complement factors and cytokines/CRP, which were 
normalised within 24 hours. Effects on cytokines, complement factors and CRP were not measured in the 
pivotal trial. However, it is considered that these are elevated during infusion related reactions, which were 
more common in patisiran-treated patients than in the placebo group. Since IRRs were manageable in the 
pivotal trial, there is no need to routinely monitor these IRR-related laboratory assessments during treatment 
with patisiran post-approval. 
ADAs and safety 
Development of treatment-emergent ADA to PEG2000- C –DMG was rare and occurred in both patirsiran- 
(3.4%) and placebo-treated patients (1.30%) in study 004. There was no correlation between ADA and IRRs, 
anaphylactic reactions, or hypersensitivity events.  
PEG2000-C-DMG is exposed on the surface of patisiran-LNP to the immune system. Anti-PEG-ADA have also 
been described in subjects treated with PEGylated protein drugs. The applicant has described their efforts to 
try to establish ADA assays also for the other components of the nano-particle delivery system and the active 
component. However, this has not been possible to achieve due to some components considered relatively 
“autologous” and other technical issues such as rapid degradation. 
Although it cannot be fully excluded that no other types of ADA directed towards other LNP components or 
the siRNA exist, no clinical signs were observed, such as lower PK exposures or severe IRRs, suggestive of 
such additional ADAs. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences observed in the safety related to intrinsic factors (age, sex, 
weight, race), genotype, FAP stage or cardiac disease severity (cardiac subgroup or not). 
Pregnancy and contraception 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 172/188 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
There have been no reported pregnancies in the patisiran-LNP clinical development programme. 
Additional text has been included in the SmPC 4.4 regarding vitamin A supplementation and pregnancy to 
stress the fact that too low and too high levels of vitamin A may be teratogenic during pregnancy to the 
foetus. This recommendation for monitoring the vitamin A level unbalances during pregnancy is considered 
appropriate by the CHMP.

In the expanded access program in the US, 48 patients had been treated as of the cut-off date of 14 July 
2017. The patient population appears generally to be in line with the population studied in the pivotal trial 
and the dosing regimen including the premedication was the same as the one proposed in the SmPC. The 
majority of patients (79.2%) had non-V30M genotypes compared to 57.3% in the pivotal study 004.  
4 patients (8.3%) reported restless legs syndrome in the expanded access program versus only 6 patients in 
total in the main studies of the development programme (study 003, 004, 006), 5 (3.4%) in the 004/006 
studies and 1 (3.7%) in the 003/006 studies. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is known to often be secondary 
to PNP. Teodoro et al. (2015) reports that RLS frequency was increased in TTR-FAP patients (18.4% versus 
controls (4.8%) and that female sex (p=0.037) and obesity (p= 0.048) were associated with RLS in this 
patient population (Teodoro et al., A peripheral pathway to restless legs syndrome? Clues from familial 
amyloid polyneuropathy, Parkinsonism Relat Disord. 2015 Dec;21(12):1465-8). The apparent difference in 
frequency between the clinical development studies and the expanded access program may be related to the 
overall small sample sizes.   
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In total 218 patients with hATTR have been exposed to patisiran during the clinical development programme. 
179 have been dosed for at least 12 months and 101 for at least 24 months, which is considered as an 
acceptable size for a safety database of an orphan drug. However, long-term safety data are still limited. In 
this respect, the applicant has committed to conduct, post approval, a prospective observational study to 
monitor and assess the long-term safety of patisiran-LNP in hATTR amyloidosis patients. The main AEs were 
IRRs, which are manageable with premedication and slowing or temporary stopping of infusion if necessary. 
In addition consequences of vitamin A deficiency and hepatic disorders are considered potential risks and are 
appropriately captured in the RMP.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the RMP version 1 is acceptable. 
2.10.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
The Applicant noted the PRAC rapporteur’s team request for a progress report on the Global Pregnancy 
Surveillance Program (currently under discussion with the FDA) within the first PSUR for Onpattro. 
2.11.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of patisiran with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 177/188 
  
  
 
 
 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers patisiran to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.12.  Product information 
2.12.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.12.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Onpattro (patisiran) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, life-threatening, autosomal 
dominant multi-systemic disease caused by mutations in the TTR gene that results in rapidly progressive, 
debilitating morbidity and high mortality.  It has a male predominance (approximately 3:1 male to female 
ratio) with diagnosis typically occurring in the seventh decade. The cardinal manifestations of hATTR 
amyloidosis are polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. 
The estimated European prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis is 0.10 per 10,000, with the majority of cases in 
Portugal, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In Europe, the prevalence is highest in northern Portugal 
and northern Sweden. In northern Sweden is as high as 50 per 100,000 inhabitants. The age of onset of 
disease varies between countries and regions due to differences in the most common mutation types, which 
is also related to founder effects. For example, in Portugal the median age of onset is 30-40 years. The 
progression rate appears somewhat faster in early onset disease. 
The survival after diagnosis is dependent on time from first symptom to diagnosis and also on age of onset. 
The applicant refers to publications claiming a median survival after diagnosis of a mere 4.7 years (range 1.3 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 178/188 
  
  
to 24.8 years). In comparison, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) states that 
the survival is 9-13 years from onset. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently limited treatment options that may alter the course of the hATTR disease, namely 
orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) and TTR tetramer stabilizers, exist for a small subset of patients. OLT 
essentially eliminates mutant TTR from the circulation but does not affect the hepatic production of wt TTR, 
which continues to be made by the transplanted liver.  OLT is only effective in slowing the progression of 
disease in patients with an early age of onset (<50 years of age), especially for those with the V30M 
mutation and short disease duration before transplant.  Consequently, almost two-thirds of patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis are not transplant-eligible.  Even when OLT is possible, morbidity and mortality are 
substantial; patients require life-long immunosuppressive medications, with their attendant risks of infection 
and renal injury.  One-year mortality rates of up to 10% have been reported. 
TTR tetramer stabilizers (including tafamidis and diflunisal) act by binding to the T4-binding site on TTR to 
reduce its dissociation into misfolded amyloidogenic monomers. Tafamidis received approval from EMA under 
exceptional circumstances in November 2011 ‘for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients 
with stage I symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment’. Tafamidis has been 
reported to be generally well tolerated.  Long-term follow-up of the early stage V30M patients who continued 
tafamidis treatment showed continued neuropathy progression over time. Diflunisal, a generic, oral 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been demonstrated to bind to and stabilize the TTR 
tetramer in a manner similar to tafamidis, was shown to reduce neuropathy progression compared with 
placebo in V30M and non-V30M patients with hATTR amyloidosis with both early and late stage neuropathy in 
a Phase 3 United States (US) National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. Diflunisal is not an approved 
treatment for hATTR amyloidosis in any country. Overall, the data to date with TTR tetramer stabilizers 
indicate some slowing of neuropathy progression, with effects limited in the case of tafamidis to early stage 
V30M patients, and no effect on the cardiac manifestations of the disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal evidence of efficacy of Onpattro comes from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
conducted in 225 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with a TTR mutation and symptomatic polyneuropathy 
(study 004). The primary efficacy variable selected was the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 
(mNIS+7). It is a composite neurologic impairment score that was developed specifically for monitoring 
progression of neurologic impairment in hATTR amyloidosis patients. This endpoint is a composite measure of 
motor, sensory, and autonomic polyneuropathy including assessments of motor strength and reflexes, 
quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction studies, and postural blood pressure, with the score ranging 
from 0 to 304 points, where a higher score indicates more pronounced impairment. 
Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive IV 0.3 mg/kg patisiran or placebo once every 3 weeks for 18 
months. All patients received premedication with a corticosteroid, paracetamol, and H1 and H2 blockers. 
A total of 82.2% of the 225 patients completed study treatment More subjects discontinued treatment in the 
placebo group 29/77 (37.7%) versus 11/148 (7.4%) in the patisiran group. The most common reason for 
study treatment discontinuation overall was withdrawal of consent and the dominating causes for withdrawal 
of consent in the placebo group were lack of efficacy or worsening of disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 179/188 
  
  
A cardiac subpopulation was defined within an amendment to the SAP (SAP V2.0, 31 May 2017) and included 
patients with pre-existing cardiac amyloid involvement, defined as patients with baseline left ventricular (LV) 
wall thickness ≥1.3 cm and no aortic valve disease or hypertension in medical history. For the Cardiac 
Subpopulation, the change from baseline to Month 18 in LV wall thickness, LV mass, LVEF, LV longitudinal 
strain, NT-proBNP and troponin I were analysed. Being part of this population was not a stratification factor 
at randomization. The proportion of cardiac patients was higher in the patisiran-LNP group than the placebo 
group; 60.8% vs. 46.8%, respectively. 
Additional data for the application were provided from the following studies: 
Two Phase 1 patisiran-LNP single ascending dose (SAD) studies in healthy volunteers contributed 
pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments (eg, TTR levels), pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and safety data.  Study 
ALN-TTR02-002 was a Phase 2 multiple ascending dose (MAD) study that contributed PD, PK, and safety 
data in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy; this study supported the selection of the 
patisiran-LNP dose and regimen for continued development. 
Study 003 was a multinational, multicenter, Phase 2, open-label, extension study designed to provide long 
term (up to 2 years) patisiran-LNP dosing to patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy who 
received and tolerated patisiran-LNP in Study 002. 
Study 006 is an ongoing multicenter, multinational, open-label extension study.  Eligible patients who 
completed either of the two parent Studies, 003 or 004, were given the option to participate in this study.   
Interim results from Study 006 were presented by the applicant with data cut-off date (14 July 2017). All 25 
patients who completed Study 003 had enrolled in Study 006.  163 of the 169 patients who completed Study 
004 had enrolled in Study 006. Patients from Study 004 remained blinded to Study 004 treatment 
assignment during participation in Study 006 at the time of the interim data cut. Efficacy assessment is 
presented for the smaller subset of approximately 64 patients who had the efficacy assessment performed at 
Week 52. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dose-dependent reductions in serum TTR concentrations with patisiran LNP were observed in both healthy 
volunteers and in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Long term dosing with patisiran LNP 
sustained a mean TTR reduction of approximately 80% over 2 years of treatment.   
In the pivotal study 004, neurologic impairment as assessed by mean mNIS+7 change from baseline at 18 
months was +27.96 points for the placebo group, which is in line with the estimated worsening per year 
(+17.8) found in a multinational study of 282 patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The patisiran patients mean 
change at 18 months was -6.03 mNIS+7 points. The difference in neurologic impairment was statistically 
significant: -33.99 [-39.86; -28.13] points (LS mean (SEM) favouring the patisiran group. The observed 
effects are expected to translate into improvements of the motor, sensory and autonomic neurologic 
functioning of the patients. 
Statistically significant differences favouring patisiran-LNP group compared to placebo at 18 months were 
observed for all secondary endpoints, as illustrated by quality of life as assessed by Norfolk QoL-DN at 18 
months group (LS mean difference between patisiran-LNP – Placebo groups, [95% CI, p-value]): (-21.3 
points [-27.2; -15.0, P=1.103 ×10-10]), motor strength (NIS-W)( -17.87 points [ -22.32, -13.43, P=1.404E-
13]), disability (R-ODS)(+9.0 points [7.0, 10.9, P=4.066E-16]), gait speed (10-MWT)( 0.311 m/sec [0.23, 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 180/188 
  
  
0.39, P=1.875E-12]), nutritional status (mBMI)( +115.7 kg/m2 × albumin g/L [82.4, 149.0, P=8.832E-11]) 
and autonomic symptoms (COMPASS 31)( 7.53 points [-11.89, -3.16, P=0.0008]). These results obtained for 
the secondary endpoints are expected to translate into imnprovments of a broad range of clinical 
manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis which would allow patients achieve a better quality life. 
A consistent treatment effect of patisiran on mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN was observed across subgroups 
(age [<65; ≥65], gender, race [white, non-white], region [North America, Western Europe, Rest of World], 
NIS [< 50; ≥ 50], genotype [V30M; non-V30M], genotype class [Early onset V30M; Other], previous 
tetramer use, FAP stage [I & II] and cardiac subpopulation.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Stabilization or improvement in PND score is seen for patients who had PND I, PND II, PND IIIA or PND IIIB 
score at baseline, but patients with the most severe form of the disease (FAP stage III corresponding to PND 
stage IV) were excluded from the pivotal study.  
The applicant has analysed data from the pivotal study 004 on placebo patients having progressed to reach 
PND IV  at month 9 showing that all patients (n=5 plus one patient who was PND IV at baseline) had a 
consistent worsening in clinical measures.  Of these 6 patients, 1 subsequently enrolled in Study 006 and had 
efficacy assessments 12 months after starting patisiran-LNP.  The other 5 patients did not have efficacy data 
after starting patisiran-LNP due to study discontinuation (n=1), death (n=2) or had not reached the 12-
month efficacy visit in Study 006 (n=2).  The applicant also presented data from 6 patients who were PND IV 
at baseline in Study 006. Results in these patients, indicate a stabilization of clinical measures during 
patisiran-LNP treatment. However, 4 of these patients had been treated with patisiran-LNP in study 004 and 
thus, had progressed on active treatment before showing stabilisation of disease progression. 
The pivotal study was designed to show efficacy on polyneuropathy while the effect on cardiac manifestations 
were investigated by exploratory surrogate endpoints with analyses focused on the cardiac subpopulation.  
Of the studied patients in Study 004, 56% were included in the pre-defined cardiac subpopulation; i.e., they 
had evidence of cardiac amyloid involvement (mean LV wall thickness ≥1.3 cm in the absence of potentially 
confounding medical history [hypertension or aortic stenosis]). Patients with NYHA class III and IV were 
excluded from the study. In these patients, centrally-assessed echocardiograms showed decreases in LV wall 
thickness (LS mean difference: −0.9 mm [95% CI −1.7, −0.2]) and longitudinal strain (LS mean difference: 
−1.37% [95% CI -2.48, -0.27]) with Onpattro treatment relative to placebo. N-terminal pro-B type 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 727 ng/L and 711 ng/L at baseline (geometric mean) in Onpattro-
treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively.  At 18 months, the adjusted geometric mean ratio to 
baseline was 0.89 with Onpattro and 1.97 with placebo (ratio, 0.45; p < 0.001), representing a 55% 
difference in favour of Onpattro. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) appeared to be dose-dependent with IRR events not occurring in the lower 
dose groups (0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg) and only occurring in the 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg dose groups in the 
dose-response SAD and MAD studies. In the pivotal trial 004 with only the 0.3 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks 
compared to placebo, infusion-related reactions were more common in the patisiran (18.9%) than in the 
placebo (9.1%) group. All these IRRs were mild to moderate and resolved. In the patisiran group, of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 181/188 
  
  
patients with IRRs, the majority (78.6%) had their first IRR within the first 2 doses and >82.1% by the third 
dose. 
Events potentially related to extravasation have been reported in 0.3% of patisiran infusions and symptoms 
consist of phlebitis, localized pain, burning sensation, swelling, tenderness, or redness at or near the infusion 
site. 
Other adverse events, which occurred in at least 3% more patients on patisiran treatment than on placebo in 
the pivotal trial, were: 
Peripheral oedema (29.7% vs 22.1%) 
Arthralgia (7.4% vs 0%) 
Muscle spasms (8.1% vs 1.3%) 
Dyspnoea (6.8% vs 0%) 
In total, there were 21 deaths in the patisiran development programme; 15 deaths in patisiran-treated 
patients and 6 in placebo-treated patients. During the placebo-controlled study 004, there were 7 (4.7%) 
deaths in the patisiran arm and 6 (7.8%) deaths in the placebo arm. Expressed in number of deaths per 100 
PYs, there were 3.2 deaths per 100 PYs in the patisiran group vs 6.24 deaths per 100 PYs in the placebo 
group. During the open-label studies 003 and 006 there were an additional 7 deaths in patisiran-treated 
patients. 14 of the 21 patients who died were allocated to the cardiac subgroup at baseline. The SAEs 
reported as fatal were adjudicated to the cardiovascular (CV) subgroup in 12 out of 15 of the patisiran-
treated patients and in 3 out of 6 of the placebo-treated patients. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There was a trend for slightly elevated ALT (26.4% vs 13.0% >ULN and ≤3xULN), AST (20.9% vs 5.2% 
>ULN and ≤3xULN) and total bilirubin (6.1% vs 2.6%, >ULN and ≤1.5xULN) in the patisiran group vs the 
placebo group in the pivotal study 004. There were no Hy’s Law cases (AST or ALT >3 × ULN and total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN). No clinically meaningful changes in liver function tests occurred with patisiran-LNP 
treatment relative to placebo for up to 18 months of treatment (study 004) and ALT and AST levels have 
continued to remain stable in the open label study (study 006) for up to 49.5 months. There were no changes 
in APL or total bilirubin. It is considered that no monitoring of liver function is warranted during treatment 
with patisiran-LNP in the clinical setting. Although this small increase of hepatic transaminases seems stable 
over time, there is a need to further assess the hepatic effects of patisiran post-marketing as part of a 
prospective observational study to monitor and assess the safety of patisiran-LNP in a real-world cohort of 
hATTR amyloidosis patients. Hepatic disorders are included as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
Premedication with corticosteroid, anti-H1, anti-H2 and acetaminophen induced adverse drug reactions, 
including serious ADRs, in patients treated in clinical studies. The applicant did not differentiate ADR by drug 
used as part of the premedication. However, osteoporosis and insomnia reported in more than 3% of patients 
can be related to corticosteroid. Other ADRs associated to corticosteroid use were also reported as 
‘Cushingoid’, ‘hyperglycemia’, ‘glycosuria urine present’ and ‘glucose tolerance impaired’.  Therefore the 
CHMP has found appropriate the SmPC recommendation  to decrease corticosteroid posology in patients to a 
minimal dose of 5 mg of intravenous dexamethasone or equivalent for patients who have tolerated their 
patisiran infusions well.

In addition, the long-term safety will be followed up in the above mentioned prospective observational study. 
The nonclinical PK data indicate that there was no accumulation of the PEG lipid in the liver. Further, 
nonclinical and modelled clinical PK data suggest that there is no further liver accumulation of the DLin-MC3-
DMA lipid after reaching steady state following 24 weeks of multiple dosing. However, the prediction of 
human liver concentration of PEG and DLin-MC3-DMA lipids based on allometric scaling from rat and monkey 
PK data doesn’t provide a satisfactory level of certainty. It might be possible that steady state in the liver of 
the two lipids is reached at the same time in plasma and the liver if there is no rate determining step that 
might influence the half-life in the liver. However, in the absence of an established methodology to examine 
this in humans so the issue is not further pursued. 
In the placebo-controlled study, no difference between the treatment arms was observed in patients 
reporting at least an AE in SOC eye disorders. Analysis per preferred term (PT) showed that a higher 
percentage of patients in the patisiran group reported AEs such as dry eye (4.7% vs 2.6%) and vision blurred 
(2.7% vs 1.3%). No safety signal related to visual disorders, including visual impairment, visual acuity 
reduced or vision blurred, was observed in patients exposed to patisiran in clinical trials which could be 
attributed to vitamin A deficiency. However, as ocular changes can occur in patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
and it is important to assess if these changes could potentially be related to vitamin A deficiency. Therefore  
a warning about the ocular signs and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and recommendation for referral for 
ophthalmological assessment if such symptoms occur have been included in SmPC section 4.4.  
Low RBP and vitamin A levels were observed during the clinical development, as expected, as serum TTR is a 
carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP). Therefore the CHMP considered that a recommendation for vitamin A 
supplementation to be included in section 4.2 of the SmPC, and the recommended daily intake of 2,500 IU 
(as used during the clinical studies) as a reference daily intake.  
In addition, unbalance in vitamin A levels during the first trimester of the pregnancy may lead to teratogenic 
effects for the foetus; specific recommendations for vitamin A supplementation during an unplanned or 
planned pregnancy have also been included in the SmPC.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, a substantial effect of patisiran LNP on reducing the serum TTR concentrations has been convincingly 
shown in the clinical studies. Furthermore, in the pivotal study 004 the worsening from baseline at 18 months 
in the primary end-point for the placebo group was in line with the estimated change per year, in contrast to 
the patisiran patients with a subtle numerical improvement instead of the expected worsening. The results 
from the secondary endpoints in study 004, and the results from the open labelled studies 003 and 006, 
strongly support a positive effect on the neuropathy progression in the studied population of hATTR patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/554262/2018 
Page 184/188 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The results were consistent in subgroups based on e.g. age, gender, race, region, age at diagnosis, 
genotype, previous tetramer use, FAP stage [I & II] and cardiac subpopulation. 
The study population in the pivotal study 004 was limited to subjects with Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) 
Scores of 0-IIIB hATTR/FAP stages 1 and 2. It is acknowledged that the clinical data from study 004 shows a 
convincing difference between patisiran and placebo regardless of baseline disease stages at inclusion for the 
studied population.  However, there is only very limited data in patients with more severe disease and it is 
therefore not found adequate to extrapolate the results from less severe to more advanced stages of the 
disease (PND stage IV/FAP stage 3 = non ambulatory patients).  
The pivotal study was primarily designed to show an effect on hATTR disease with polyneuropathy and the 
cardiac endpoints were included as exploratory surrogate endpoints in a cardiac subpopulation including 56% 
of the study population. Since the definition of the cardiac population was included as a study amendment, 
inclusion in the study was not stratified based on this. Further, patients with NYHA III and IV were not 
included.  The results of the pivotal study show a difference compared to placebo for several of the measured 
echocardiographic variables as well as on the biomarker NT-proBNP, favoring Patisiran.  
The applicant has employed in the pivotal study a surrogate marker (NT-proBNP) that has not been shown to 
correlate with clinically relevant outcomes in the context of therapeutic interventions. Despite the limitations, 
the results indicate that patisiran treatment seems to have positive impact on cardiac parameters (which is 
plausible from a biological perspective) even though the importance of this effect is not fully understood. 
With respect to safety, the most serious issue is the risk of IRR which occurred in the pivotal study despite 
premedication with e.g. corticosteroids. Most reactions were mild to moderate, but may be serious problem in 
the context of home infusion. However, infusion of Onpattro at home may be considered for patients who 
have tolerated at least 3 infusions well in the clinic. The decision for a patient to receive home infusions 
should be made after evaluation and recommendation by the treating physician. Home infusions should be 
performed by a healthcare professional. 
Ocular changes can occur in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and it is important to assess if these changes 
could potentially be related to vitamin A deficiency. Therefore  a warning about the ocular signs and 
symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and recommendation for referral for ophthalmological assessment if such 
symptoms occur have been included in SmPC section 4.4. Consequently, the recommendation for vitamin A 
supplementation is warranted up to a daily intake of 2,500 IU. In addition, as vitamin A is a potent teratogen 
at both low and high amounts, maintenance of balanced vitamin A levels during pregnancy is essential for 
normal foetal development. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall the favorable effects on neuropathy clearly outweigh the unfavorable effects in the population 
studied, i.e. hATTR amyloidosis patients with FAP stage I and II.  Even though there are uncertainties 
associated with the clinical relevance of results on cardiac parameters (see above), considering the 
pronounced effect of patisiran on neurological endpoints and the biological plausibility of an effect also on 
other manifestations of the disease (supported by the mechanism of action of patisiran and the 
pathophysiology of the condition), the presented results  are considered sufficient to support the claim of 
‘treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in patients with stage 1 or stage 2 
polyneuropathy’.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Onpattro is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Onpattro is not similar to Vyndaqel and Tegsedi within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Onpattro is favourable in the following indication: 
Onpattro is indicated for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) 
in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy

Page 186/188 
  
  
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Onpattro in each Member State (MS), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational materials, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Onpattro is marketed, all health care professionals (HCPs) and 
patients are provided with educational materials in order to ensure the safe and sustainable administration of 
the  product  in  the  home  setting,  aiming  at  preventing  and/or  minimising  the  important  identified  risk  of 
Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs). 
The educational material for HCPs should include information about: 
•  Suitability of the patient for home infusion; 
•  Requirements  for  home  infusion,  including  availability  and  timely  administration  of  the  appropriate 
premedication; 
• 
The appropriate infusion rate; 
•  Signs and symptoms of IRRs; 
•  Action to take in the event of an IRRs and in case of emergency; 
•  Steps to consider to prevent further IRRs; 
•  Reasons  triggering  HCPs  to  consider  whether  the  patient  should  stop  home  infusions  and  return  to 
the clinic to receive the infusions. 
The  educational  material  for  patients  (a  home  infusion  guide  detailing  the  steps  to  undertake  during  home 
infusion) should include information about: 
•  How the infusion is given; 
• 
The potential for IRRs to occur; 
•  Signs and symptoms of IRRs; 
• 
Patients  to  inform  immediately  the  HCP  if  they  experience  any  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of 
IRRs.

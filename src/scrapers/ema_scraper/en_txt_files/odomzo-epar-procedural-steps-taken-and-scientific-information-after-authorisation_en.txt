1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Odomzo in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Submission of the final Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) 
for studies X2114 and X2203, whereby the MAH 
committed to collect cardiac events, second primary 
malignancies and fractures. These two exploratory 
studies conclude that the safety profile for sonidegib 
remains unchanged. None of them led to an update 
of the product information.  
In addition, the MAH proposed updates to the EU 
Risk Management Plan (RMP, v3.2) to reflect 
completion of these studies (X2114 and X2203) and 
changes to the due dates for provision of the final 
study reports for the category 3 studies 
LDE225C2301 and LDE225X2104. 
The requested group of variations proposed 
amendments to the Risk Management Plan.

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild 
Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC to add 
information on posology and pharmacology of 
sonidegib in hepatic impaired patients based on 
results from study CLDE225A2113 (MEA 006) and 
update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to add information 
on Drug-Drug interaction with proton pump inhibitors 
(esomeprazole) based on results from study 
CLDE225A2118 (MEA 007). The Risk Management 
Plan of the product has been updated accordingly 
and the final version approved is 3.1.

(Child Pugh class A) or moderate (Child Pugh class B) 
hepatic impairment.  
Results from a clinical study demonstrated a change in 
sonidegib exposure (32% and 38% decrease in AUC and 
Cmax ) after co-administration of a single dose of Odomzo 
200 mg with esomeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) at 40 
mg daily for 6 days in healthy subjects. This interaction is 
not expected to be clinically significant.

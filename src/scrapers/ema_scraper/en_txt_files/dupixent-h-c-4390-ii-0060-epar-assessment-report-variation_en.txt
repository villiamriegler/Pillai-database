2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic pruritic condition characterized by 
systemic immune dysregulation, altered epidermal-barrier function, and relapsing inflammatory skin 
lesions, variably characterised by erythema, edema, scaling, erosions/excoriations, oozing/crusting, and 
lichenification depending on patient age, ethnicity, and disease chronicity. The pathophysiology of AD is 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 7/183 
 
 
 
 
complex and is influenced by genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors which lead to a 
dysfunctional skin barrier and dysregulation of the  immune system (Bieber, 2008)  (Eichenfield, 2014).  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
This submission proposes to extend the  pediatric age range for the DUPIXENT indication  in AD to include 
children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age as follows:  
Atopic dermatitis 
Adults and adolescents 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment  of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in  adults and adolescents 
12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Children 6 months to 11  years of age 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment  of severe atopic dermatitis in chil dren 6 months to 11  years old 
who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Epidemiology 
Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants and children (Mortz, 2015).  In a 
study conducted in children 3 to 11 years old with  AD, the onset of the condition  occurred before the age 
of 6 months in 45%  of children and before the age of 1 year in 60%  of children with  AD (Kay, 1994).  A 
cross-sectional, international epidemiologic study showed the  point prevalence of AD for children aged 6 
months to <6  years ranges from 3.3%  to 18.7% globally and is 10.2% in the  US, 16.1% in the  United 
Kingdom, and 7.1% in Germany (Silverberg, 2021). In a study of children aged up to 2.5  years with AD 
conducted in the United  Kingdom (n=8530),  the period prevalence rates  of AD were highest at age 6 
months to 18  months (25.6%)  compared with 21%  at 0 months to  6 months, 23.2%  at 18 months to  23 
months, and 19.9%  at 30 months to  42 months (Wadonda -Kabondo, 2003).  Disparities may exist even 
within  industrialized nations, with  urban children and black females disproportionately impacted 
(McKenzie, 2019). 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by genetics and environmental factors and involves a complex 
interplay between antigens,  skin barrier defects, and immune dysregulation, in which a polari sed 
inflammatory response induced by the marked activation of the  T -helper type 2 (Th2) cell axis plays a 
central role (Gittler,  2012). Two cytokines, IL-4  and IL-13 are critical in the initiation  and maintenance of 
the type 2 inflammatory pathway (Gandhi, 2016).  The elevated IgE responses and eosinophilia observed 
in the majority of patients  with  AD reflects an increased expression of the type 2 cytokines IL -4 and IL-13 
(Leung, 1999).  Type 2 cytokines regulate important  barrier-related functions, such as epidermal 
cornification and production of antimicrobial proteins. These cytokines inhibit the  production of major 
terminal differentiation proteins, such as loricrin, filaggrin, invo lucrin, and the antimicrobial proteins 
human beta defensing 2 and 3 (Howell,  2007)  (Guttman-Yassky, 2011a)  (Guttman-Yassky, 2011b).  The 
type 2 cytokines also act on keratinocytes and induce production of chemokines, including chemokine (C -
C motif) ligand 17 (also known as TARC) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 (also known as eotaxin-3), 
which are chemo-attractants for the Th2  cells and eosinophils, thus perpetuating the inflammatory 
response. Infant AD presents robust downregulations of multiple  barrier -related genes in both lesional 
and nonlesional skin (Renert-Yuval, 2021a).  The shared signature of AD across ages is type 2-skewed 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 8/183 
 
 
 
 
and clinical severity scores significantly correlate with type 2-related markers in all pediatric age groups 
(Renert-Yuval, 2021a).  Most mechanistic studies investigating  the cellular and molecular mechanisms of 
disease in AD are limited to evaluating peripheral blood biomarkers given the difficulties involved with  
collection of skin biopsies in children. These studies have shown that,  as in adults, disease activity 
in children correlates with several serum biomarkers (ie, CCL17, eosinophils, IgE) and a limited array of 
Th2/Th1 markers (Brunner, 2017)  (Renert-Yuval, 2021b). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Clinical presentation of AD in infants (≤1  year) involves lesions that  often emerge in the first few months 
of life, affecting the  cheeks with pruritic papules and vesicles that form oozing plaques with  crust. In 
addition, the  scalp, neck, extensor extremities, and trunk may be  diffusely affected by inflammatory 
lesions. After 1 to 2  years, lesions can still be acute; however, lichenified, chronic lesions begin to 
predominate with  a predilection for flexural sites. In addition, hand and foot dermatitis as well as 
nummular plaques with  oozing and crusting on the hands and wrists can appear (Nomura, 2020). Linear 
excoriations due to scratching are common. The background nonlesional skin is often xerotic, and there 
may be plate-like ichthyosis of the distal  extremities, especially in older children. The cycle of itching and 
scratching exacerbates the cellular damage in skin lesions and facilitates secondary infections, which can 
be serious (Boguniewicz, 2018). 
Children with  AD, similar to adults with  AD, are more frequently colonised with  Staphylococcus aureus 
than their healthy counterparts. In addition, AD patients are at an increased risk for eczema herpeticum, 
a potentially life-threatening disseminated herpes simplex infection.  
Atopic dermatitis has been shown to have a marked im pact on the quality of life (QoL) of pediatric 
patients, greater than that  seen in other common skin disorders like psoriasis and urticarial (Beattie, 
2006).  In one study nearly two-thirds  of children with severe AD had moderately -to-highly impaired QoL 
(Ricci, 2007).  In infants,  the greatest impact of AD includes itching, sleep loss, mood and behavioral 
changes (Ramirez, 2019a) (Lewis-Jones, 2001).  In children, severe pruritus is an almost universal finding 
in AD. Parents or caregivers of children with  moderate and severe AD spend nearly 3  hours a day caring 
for their child’s skin causing parental fatigue and irritability due to lack of sleep and/or privacy, often due 
to co-sleeping, and lack of leisure and family time. This, as well as treatment-related financial 
expenditures, and feelings of hopelessness, guilt,  and depression (Tollefson, 2014)  (Mancini,  2008) 
(Ahmed, 2013) adversely impact QoL and psychological and emotional wellbeing (Ramirez, 2019b)  (Ricci, 
2007)  (Drucker, 2017). 
Patients with  AD are at  risk of developing both allergic comorbidities and non-allergic conditions  such as 
obesity, and autoimmune disease, particularly alopecia areata and gastrointestinal immune -mediated 
disorders (Paller, 2018).  Of particular interest  in younger children is the phenomenon of “Atopic March” 
which is characterized by a typical sequence of progression of clinical signs of atopic disease. In general, 
the clinical signs of AD and of food allergies predate the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis, 
suggesting that  AD is an “entry point” for subsequent allergic disease (Spergel, 2003).  Infants and young 
children with  severe AD have a reported risk rate of around 60% for developing asthma later on in life 
compared to a risk of around 30%  in patients with  mild AD (Ricci, 2006). 
Management 
Currently available therapies have significant side effects, and various systemic immunosuppressive drugs 
are used off-label with  little  evidence to support their use. Similar to the  adult and adolescent 
populations, topical treatment is the  mainstay of management of AD in  children.  
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 9/183 
 
 
 
 
Topical corticosteroids (TCS) of varying potency represent the cornerstone of topical treatment and some 
low potency TCS are approved in pediatric patients <1  year old. However, their long -term use or 
application to the large body-surface area is limited  by the risk of local side effects (eg, skin atrophy and 
telangiectasia) as well as systemic adverse effects, including  hypothalamic -pituitary-adrenal axis 
suppression and Cushing’s syndrome (Hengge, 2006).   
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also available for use in 
children, mostly as second-line therapy as an alternative to or in combination with  TCS. Use of these 
agents is typically limited  to areas that are prone to skin atrophy from application of TCS, (eg, face, 
genitals, and flexural areas). Tacrolimus 0.03%  is approved for use in ages ≥2  years, however, the more 
effective higher potency formation (0.1%)  is not approved for use in children less than  <16  years in the 
US or EU.  Concerns of skin malignancies and increased risk of lymphomas have prompted some 
regulatory authorities to  require a warning in  the prescribing information regarding their long -term 
safety, including  a boxed warning from the FDA.  
For pediatric patients with  severe disease resistant to topical therapies, systemic corticosteroids, 
phototherapy (UVA and UVB), and systemic immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporine,  
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate) are utilized in clinical practice. A recent survey 
conducted in Europe found that approximately 70% of specialists recommended off -label systemic 
therapy for children with  severe AD (Proudfoot, 2013).  None of these drugs, apart from systemic 
corticosteroids, are approved for the treatment of AD in  children. Use of systemic corticosteroids is 
strongly discouraged in AD due to lack of safety and efficacy data from well -designed studies, side effects 
associated with  both short and long-term use, and risk of disease rebound following discontinuation 
(Boguniewicz, 2017) (Drucker, 2018). 
Other systemic immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, and 
mycophenolate mofetil, have been used off-label in infants and young children despite minimal evidence 
for the use of these agents in children, including limited data on efficacy, optimal dosing and monitoring, 
and significant potential  side effects that include a wide variety of hematologic and organ toxicities and 
drug interactions (Lebwohl, 2019)  (Flohr, 2013)  (Purvis, 2019) (Anderson, 2019). These agents are 
nonselective, broad-acting immunosuppressive agents that  can predispose patients to infection. 
Moreover, these agents can increase the risk of malignancy (Garritsen, 2017).   
Ummet medical need 
Severe AD is a serious, chronic, debilitating  skin disease with substantial  impact on day -to-day 
functioning  and wellbeing of affected paediatric patients and their parents. It shares pathophysiological 
pathways with  other atopic/allergic conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies, which 
are common comorbidities in patients  with  AD. The currently available treatments for AD in p aediatric 
patients, including  those 6 months to 6 years of age, have important limitations  including unsatisfactory 
effectiveness and important  risks and side effects. Systemic therapies are used off -label with  little 
evidence to support their use. These limitations  result in a large number of paediatric patients with  severe 
AD whose disease cannot be safely controlled by the existing therapies. Therefore, there exists a 
significant unmet  medical need for a treatment that  is safe and effective for long term use, especially for 
paediatric patients  with  severe forms of the disease not  adequately controlled by topical prescrip tion 
therapies. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that  inhibits 
interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13  signaling by specifically binding  to the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) subunit 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 10/183 
 
 
 
 
shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits  IL-4 signaling via the Type I 
receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13  signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). 
Blocking IL-4Rα with  dupilumab inhibits  IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced responses, including the release 
of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immunoglobulin E (IgE). Dupilumab belongs to the 
pharmacological class of immunomodulators, IL inhibitors. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance 
Because AD shares pathophysiological pathways with  other atopic/allergic conditions such as asthma, 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with  nasal polyps (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), allergic rhinitis, and 
food allergies, and patients with  atopy often suffer from multiple  comorbid conditions with  varying 
severity, dupilumab has already received regulatory approval or is in  clinical development for a number of 
type 2 inflammatory conditions. These have included AD in adults  and pediatric patients aged ≥6 years, 
asthma (adult and pediatric patients ≥6  years), CRSwNP in adults,  and other indications  (in phase 2 or 
3).  
The dupilumab pediatric AD program includes the following age subsets:  
• Adolescents aged ≥12 to <18  years: phase 3 completed; marketing application approved in multiple 
regions  
• Children aged ≥6  to <12 years: phase 3  completed; marketing application approved in multiple regions  
• Children and infants aged ≥6  months to <6 yea rs: Current submission 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP

2.2.1.  Justification regarding existing Drug-Device Combination 
In 3.2.R Regional information justifications  have been provided regarding the use of the existing Medical 
Device Part of the Drug-Device Combination (DDC) 300 mg PFS, 200  mg PFS -S and 300  mg PFS-S for the 
AD paediatric patient population 6  months to 5 years of age. 
Change  assessment towards MDR  Article 117 (PFS, PFS-S) 
The MAH has determined that  there are no changes to  the design or intended purpose of the device 
(part), nor is there a new medical device being introduced. Therefore, a Notified Body opinion  is not 
deemed required. The details of the MAH´s assessment is as follows: 
• There is no impact on the medical device clinical use. According to  clinical experts and data obtained 
during clinical trials and consistent with  approved applications for the same marketed product, the 
injection sites defined for adults, adolescents, and children 6-11  years of age are also recommended for

targeted paediatric patient  population (from 6 months to 5 years of age), the  injection technique (lifted 
skinfold and an injection angle at 45°)  is appropriate to deliver the drug in the subcutaneous t issue for 
targeted population, and the needle length  combined with  injection technique defined above is 
appropriate to avoid a potential  intra-muscular injection. 
• There are no changes to the medical device instructions for use related to the additional p atient 
population. 
• There is no change to the intended users who  will administer the product. Healthcare professionals and 
lay caregivers remain the only ones to  administer the  injection for this  paediatric population from 6 
months to 5  years of age, as self-injection is not recommended for this  patient population. 
Table 1 below summarizes the same intended  users and additional patient population  for th e Dupixent 
200mg and 300mg  pre-filled syringe presentations to be included in this variation.

Usability Studies 
The MAH has determined that  there is no need for additional Usability Studies.  
The quality, safety and/or efficacy of the  DDC product are not affected as the assessment results 
conclude the following: 
• There are no changes to the medical device instructions for use related to the additional patient 
population. 
• There are no changes to the performance requirements, nor the specifications of the medical device. 
• No new or different risks in relation to the medical device use have been identified, therefore no new 
mitigations  need to be introduced. The existing Risk Management File will  be updated a s part of the life 
cycle management activities. Hazard list  is already covering this additional patient population.  
With  regard to the user population (healthcare professionals and lay caregivers):  
Since the  intended user population is unchanged versus the  device currently available on the EU market, 
the bridging data can demonstrate the  effective use of the DDC by the same intended  user population 
(HCPs and lay caregivers).  
• PFS-S presentation: The relevant data (that can be bridging data to the identica l device part of the PFS-
S used in adults  and adolescents and children 6-11  years of age) resides in the existing Dupixent 
marketing authorization  (refer to VV-QUAL-0555538  2.0 which is part of Module 3 P2.4 Human  Factors 
study – 1ml and 2mL PFS-S). 
• PFS presentation: The relevant data (that  can be bridging data to the identical device part of the PFS 
used in the adult patient  population) that  resides in the existing Dupixent marketing authorization  (refer 
to QUA-PD-2016-21521  2.0 which  is part of Module  3 P2.4 Container Closure System – PFS – Le Trait – 
Cook). Moreover, published literature and instructional material which covers prefilled syringes on the

market provides guidance on how to perform subcutaneous injections with a prefilled syringe. Two links  
to examples are provided in the  3.2.R document. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on quality aspects 
No new quality data have been submitted in  this application which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The proposed change does not result in the introduction  of a new medical device or a modification to the 
design, or aforementioned intended use/purpose of the  medical device part of the Drug Device 
Combination (DDC). Therefore, it  can be agreed that  the va riation application supporting the  extension of 
the atopic dermatitis indication  in the 6 months to  5 years old patient  population does not  require a 
Notified Body Opinion (NBOp) for the  currently authorised DDC.  
From a quality point of view, the MAH´s justifications  regarding the use of the existing Medical Device 
Part of the  DDC 300 mg PFS, 200  mg PFS-S and 300 mg PFS-S for the AD paediatric patient population 6 
months to 5  years of age is accepted. 
The MAH has determined that  there is no need for additional usability studies. It can be agreed that  the 
intended user population is unchanged versus the  device currently available on the EU market and that 
the bridging data support the effective use of the DDC by the same intended user population (HCPs and 
lay caregivers).  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the quality aspects 
The available quality data do not  raise concern in the indication. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this  application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A claim for not submitting  environmental risk assessment studies is made according to Section 2  of the 
2006  CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (ERA 
Guideline corr 2) because dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of linked naturally occurring 
amino acids. Per the ERA Guideline, vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates 
and lipids are exempt from ERA study requirements because by their  natu re they are unlikely to result in 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
In conclusion, the claim for ERA exemption by the MAH is justified and in conformity with  the ERA 
guideline since the  extension of marketing authorization/type II variation request concerns a monoclonal 
antibody consisting of naturally occurring amino acids. Dupilumab is significantly metabolized in-vivo and 
Assessment report

is expected to be readily and rapidly degraded in wastewater treatment systems and in  the environment. 
The antibody’s structure  and mode of action do not  indicate any specific risk to the environment.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which is considered acceptable  by the 
CHMP. 
The extended indication does not lead to a significant  increase in environmental exposure further to the 
use of dupilumab.   
- Considering the  above data, dupilumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.  
The MAH has provided a statement to the  effect that  clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with  the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Patients aged ≥6 months  to <6 years with  AD have been included in 3 dupilumab clinical studies  where 
PK, immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic (PD) data have been collected . 
As of the data cut-off  date of 23 Jul  2021, the  dupilumab paediatric AD clinical program in  patients ≥6 
months to <6  years of age consisted of study R668-AD-1539  Part A and Part B as well as study R668-AD-
1434. 
The purpose of this application is to seek approval for dupilumab in children aged ≥6 months to <6  years 
with  severe AD.  
The proposed indication is supported primarily by data from the randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal 
study R668-AD-1539 Part B, assessing efficacy and safety of dupilumab over a 16  week treatment period 
with  concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) in children with  moderate-to-severe AD aged ≥6 months to 
<6 years. Additional supportive data are included from patients  aged ≥6 months to <6  years with severe 
AD who received a single dose of dupilumab in the PK study R668-AD-1539 Part A.  
The open-label extension (OLE) study R668-AD-1434 provides long-term safety and efficacy data on the 
chronic use of dupilumab in children ≥6 months to <6  years of age with  AD who completed previous 
studies R668-AD-1539 Part A and R668-AD-1539 Part B. Study R668-AD-1434  is an ongoing study which 
includes patients ≥6 months to <18  years of age that rolled over from different AD studies. Only data of 
patients in  study R668-AD-1434 that  rolled over from study R668-AD-1539 Part A and Part B were 
included in the present submission, representing the age group in  focus.  
SC dosing regimens that were evaluated were single dose 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg in study R668-AD-1539 
Part A and in study R668-AD-1539  Part B weight-tiered  fixed doses of 200 mg Q4W and 300  mg Q4W  for 
children weighing ≥5 to <15 kg and ≥15 to <30 kg, respectively. Loading doses were not  administered to 
children of this  age group. In the OLE study R668-AD-1434,  beginning with  Amendment 4, only the 
weight-tired  fixed dosing scheme was administered.    
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 15/183 
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed posology in patients ≥6 months to <6  years of age with  AD is a weight-tiered  dose regimen 
of 200 mg Q4W SC for body weight ≥5 to <15  kg and 300 mg Q4W SC for body weight ≥15 to  <30 kg. No 
loading dose is intended in the  age group of children ≥6 months to <6  years of age.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab have been previously characterized in adult  and p aediatric 
patients (6  years or older) with  AD and is characterized as nonlinear with  target-mediated disposition. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Overview 
The bioanalytical methods used for the AD program in children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age are the 
same used for AD patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age and included in previous applications. A 
summary of these methods is described in Table  2 below. 
Analyses included samples from the  pivotal study R668-AD-1539  Part B, the pharmacokinetic study 
R668-AD-1539 Part A, and the OLE study R688-AD-1434.

Functional dupilumab 
The functional dupilumab concentration assay (method validation report REGN668 -AV-13074-VA-01V1) 
was described in the original marketing application for adult AD. The lower limit  of quantitation  of the 
method is 78 ng/mL  in neat serum. A tabular summary of assay characteristics is provided in Table 1. 
Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) for the functional  dupilumab assay was performed for study R668 -AD-
1539  (Parts A and B) (Table 2). The ISR met acceptance criteria, indicating that  the assay generated 
robust data in the respective study population. ISR passing rate in study R668-AD-1539  was 96.8%.

Immunogenicity 
Anti-Dupilumab Antibodies (ADAs) 
Assessment of ADAs in the studies R668-AD-1539 (Part A and Part B) and R688-AD-1434 for this 
submission was conducted using  the REGN668-AV-13089-VA-01V3 assay. Previous version REGN-AV-
13089-VA-01V2 of this  assay has been described in the original marketing application for adult AD. 
Additional data were generated, and the  validation report was amended to generate REGN668 -AV-13089-
VA-01V3. These updates were provided in the  marketing application for asthma. A tabular summary of 
assay characteristics is provided in Table 3. 
The AD population cut  points were used to detect ADA in clinical samples from R668 -AD-1539 (Parts A 
and B) and R668-AD-1434  studies. These cut  points were established using statistical  methods 
recommended  in  appropriate  guidance  documents  and  literature (FDA, 2019) (EMA,  2011)  (Mire -
Sluis, 2004)  (Shankar, 2008). Based on the AD population screening cut  point factor, 7 out of 195 
baseline serum samples from R668-AD-1539  (Parts A and B) were positive in the dupilumab ADA 
screening assay, resulting in an observed false positive rate of 3.6%,  which is close to the  target false 
positive rate of 5%. This indicates that  true ADA positives were not missed, and the  AD population cut 
points are appropriate for this  pediatric (≥6 months to  <6 years of age) AD population. 
Neutralizing anti-dupilumab  antibodies (NAb) 
Assessment of neutralizing anti-dupilumab  antibodies for this submission was conducted using the 
REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V2  assay. 
REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V1  version of this  assay has been described in the original marketing 
application for adult AD. Additional data analyses were included in  the amended validation report  
(REGN668-AV-13112-VA-01V2)  submitted in  the marketing application for asthma.  
Clinical studies with collection of PK and PD data 
R668-AD-1539  Part A (Phase  2, Open-label,  Single Ascending Dose Study) 
Study Design:  R668-AD-1539 Part A was a phase 2, open-label, single ascending dose, sequential 
cohort study investigating the PK, safety, and initial  assessment of efficacy of a single dose of SC 
dupilumab in pediatric patients with  severe AD (IGA=4).  
The study enrolled patients ≥6  months to <6 years of age. Patients  were enrolled into  1 of 2 age cohorts 
and within  each age cohort, patients were enrolled into 1 of 2 dose sub -cohorts as follows:  
−  Age Cohort 1 - ≥2 to  <6 years (n=20):   
Sub-Cohort 1A: 3 mg/kg (n=10)   
Sub-Cohort 1B: 6 mg/kg (n=10)   
−  Age Cohort 2 - ≥6 months  to <2 years (n=20) 
Sub-Cohort 2A: 3 mg/kg (n=10)   
Sub-Cohort 2B: 6 mg/kg (n=10)   
Thus, a total of 40 children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age were included in the  PK analysis for the current 
application and the results are summarized below.

Part A of the study consisted of a screening period, a baseline visit, and a single -dose treatment  followed 
by a 4-week PK sampling period with samples collected for analysis of drug concentration at baseline and  
days 3, 8,  18, and 29.  
After completing the day 29 visit,  patients in study R668-AD-1539  Part A were eligible to be enrolled in 
the OLE study R668-AD-1434  (and 36 patients out  of a total  of 40  patients enrolled). For patients not 
entering the OLE, the  follow-up period was 4 weeks. 
Results (systemic exposure): 
In general, dupilumab concentration-time profiles are described by target-mediated disposition and were 
generally characterized by a brief absorption phase after SC administration, followed by a line ar 
elimination phase and a terminal target-mediated elimination phase.  
While profiles in  all treatment  groups demonstrated the target-mediated phase, the  linear phase was 
more prominent for the 6 mg/kg dose cohorts and suggested that  saturation of target-mediated pathway 
achieved in the 3 mg/kg dose cohorts may be limited in duration  (Figure 1, Figure 2).  
Median body weight was higher in patients 2 to <6  years of age than in p atients  6 month to <2  years of 
age and was comparable between dose levels within  each age cohort.  
Mean Cmax values were generally similar (≤25% difference) for the 2 to <6  years of age cohort compared 
to the 6  months to <2 years of age cohort at each dose level and median tmax was observed 
approximately 2 days after dosing for all cohorts, and suggest similar absorption kinetics between the  age 
cohorts in this study. Following  a single SC dose, dupilumab was measurable in serum for a longer 
duration in the 2  to <6 years of age cohort than in the  6 months to <2 years of age cohort at both  mg/kg 
dose levels, suggesting  higher clearance per unit body weight in children <2 years of age.  
These trends towards faster body-weight  normalized clearance of dupilumab in the  lighter, younger age 
groups are consistent with  the principles of allometric scaling that drug clearance scales less than 
proportionally with  increasing body weight.  Hence, use of a weight-tiered,  fixed dosing scheme represents 
an appropriate approach to normalizing dupilumab exposure across a wide range of body weights.

R668-AD-1539  Part B (Phase  3, Pivotal,  Randomized, Double-Blind,  Placebo-Controlled Study) 
Study Design: R668-AD-1539 Part B was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab combined with low potency TCS in  patients  ≥6 
months to <6  years of age with moderate-to-severe AD. Patients were randomized in a 1:1  ratio, 
stratified by baseline body weight  (≥5 to  <15 kg and ≥15 to <30  kg), baseline disease severity  (IGA=3 
and 4), and region/country (North  America, Europe) to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups, with  study 
treatment administered on day 1 and Q4W from week 4 to week 12: 
−  Dupilumab Q4W - weight-tiered fixed-dose (n=83):   
200 mg in patients  with  a baseline weight of ≥5 to <15  kg (n=26)   
300 mg in patients  with  a baseline weight of ≥15 to  <30 kg (n=57) 
−  Placebo Q4W: matching placebo based on baseline weight  category (n=78) 
A total of 161 children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age were included in  the PK analysis for the current 
application and the results are summarized below. 
The study consisted of 3 periods: screening, including 2  we eks of TCS standardization (up to 56 days), 
treatment (16  weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). A sparse sampling scheme was utilized with  samples

taken at baseline prior to the first dose, at  weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16/EOT,  and at week 28/EOS in case not 
entering the OLE. 
After completing the 16 weeks treatment period, 144 patients  of 161  patients in study R668-AD-1539 
Part B enrolled in the OLE study R668-AD-1434. 
Results (systemic exposure): 
Mean concentrations of dupilumab over time exhibited similar profiles in patients  weighing ≥5 to <15  kg 
at baseline receiving dupilumab 200  mg Q4W and patients weighing  ≥15 to <30  kg at baseline receiving 
dupilumab 300  mg Q4W,  respectively (Figure 3). Systemic concentrations of dupilumab in the 300  mg 
Q4W group appeared to have reached steady -state by week 12,  while the highest mean concentrations 
for the 200 mg Q4W group were observed at week 16. Accumulation of dupilumab C trough at week 16 
relative to after the initial  dose at week 4 was approximately 2-fold for both dupilumab regimens. 
The weight-tiered dosing regimen of dupilumab evaluated in this  study normalized dupilumab exposure 
across patients of differing body weight  categories. Mean ± SD dupilumab C trough at week 16  was similar 
between patients ≥5 to <15  kg receiving 200  mg Q4W (109 ± 50.8  mg/L) and patients ≥15 to  <30 kg  
receiving 300 mg Q4W (110  ± 42.8  mg/L) (Figure 4); the distribution  of Ctrough at week 16 was also 
similar across the range of baseline body weights within  each treatment  group.

R668-AD-1434  (Phase 3, Open-label,  Long-term Extension Study) 
Study Design:  R668-AD-1434 is an ongoing, phase 3,  open-label extension (OLE)  study evaluating the 
log-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in pediatric patients ≥6 months to  <18 years old with  AD  who 
have previously completed a pediatric AD dupilumab clinical study, including  parent R668-AD-1539 Part A 
and Part B. 
The original protocol was amended to include patients  ≥6 months to <6  years old with  a dose regimen for 
this age group as a weight-based regimen of 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg SC QW consistent  with  those evaluated 
in R668-AD-1539  Part A; 1 patient  from R668-AD-1539  Part A who reached age 6 between screening and 
the first dose in the OLE was initially assigned to a regimen of 300 mg Q4W per -protocol for patients of 
that  age. Under Amendment 4, all patients in the study (ages ≥6 months to  <18 years) were re -assigned 
to a weight-tiered SC dosing regimen regardless of age as follows: 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Patients weighing ≥60  kg: 300 mg Q2W (not applicable for the  current application)  
Patients weighing ≥30  to <60  kg: 200  mg Q2W*  
Patients weighing ≥15  to <30  kg: 300  mg Q4W 
Patients weighing ≥5  to <15 kg: 200  mg Q4W 
At the time of approval of Amendment 4,  36 patients ≥6 months  to <6 years old from R668 -AD-1539 
Part A were enrolled in the OLE  and switched  to the weight-tiered fixed dose regimens.  
Patients from Part B were only enrolled after Amendment 4 was implemented and started directly on the 
weight-tiered fixed dose regimens (n=144).   
*A total  of three patients  in the age group of ≥6 months  to <6 years gained weight  to move to the  ≥30 
kg body weight  category (200 mg Q2W).

Thus, a total of 180 children aged ≥6 months to <6  years old were enrolled in the study R668 -AD-1434 
at the time of the data cutoff date (23  Jul 2021),  hereof 70 patients previously on placebo (all from R668-
AD-1539 Part B) and 110  patients previously treated with  dupilumab (36 patients from study R668 -AD-
1539  Part A and 144 patients  from R668-AD-1539 Part B, respectively). 
The study consists of a screening period (day -28  to day -1),  a treatment  period of up to 5 years, and a 
12-week follow-up period. Only the portion of the data of patients ≥6  months to <6 years of age with  AD 
enrolled from parent study R668-AD-1539 Part A and Part B are presented within  this  report. 
A sparse sampling scheme was used with  samples for PK and ADA collected at  baseline prior to  the first 
dose, and at sparse timepoints  thereafter including  weeks 16, 52, 76,  104, 152,  200, 260/EOT,  and at 
week 272/EOS. 
At the time of the PK/ADA data cutoff date (23 Jul  2021) 84 patients  were included in the  PK analysis set. 
The PK analysis set includes all treated patients who received any amount of study drug (safety analysis 
set) and had at least one non-missing result for concentration of functional dupilumab following the  first 
dose of study drug in the current study. 
Results (systemic exposure): 
Mean and distribution  of trough  concentrations of dupilumab at week 16 in patients who,  at baseline, 
were ≥6  months to <6 years of age, were similar for patients receiving 200  mg Q4W (122 mg/L)  or 300 
mg Q4W (104  mg/L), and fell between trough  concentrations in  similarly aged patients  receiving 3 mg/kg 
QW (54.6  mg/L) and patients receiving 6 mg/kg QW (240 mg/L).  Once steady -state concentrations were 
achieved, these were maintained over the duration of the currently available data (Table 4).

Study R668-AD-1434; treatment  group at  all subsequent visits was defined by the last dose received 
prior to  sample collection. 
Upon CHMP’s  request, an updated PK analysis of study  R668-AD-1434 was submitted with  the data cut-
off date of 10-Mar-2022,  now including data of 167 patients and sufficient data at  week 52. Data were

Population PK Analysis 
An integrated PopPK model was developed to describe the concentrations of dupilumab across age groups 
from adults  to children as young as 6  months of age with  AD.

Nonlinear mixed effects modeling methodology was implemented in this  analysis using NONMEM® 
(version 7.4.1)  software (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott  City, MD). The first-order conditional 
estimation with  interaction (FOCEI) method was utilized.  Pre - and post-processing of data from each 
modeling step and graphical analysis of the data were performed using R (version 3.6.3  or higher).  
For prior marketing applications for adult  and pediatric AD patients, population PK analyses were 
conducted separately in healthy adults and adult patients with  AD,  adolescent patients with  AD, and 
children aged ≥6 to <12  years with AD using  the same base  model structure. Standard 2-compartment 
PopPK models with parallel linear and nonlinear Michaelis -Menten (MM)  elimination  and transit 
compartments to describe absorption were previously developed to describe th e pharmacokinetics of 
dupilumab. The final parameter estimates for each model are provided in  Table  5 below.

To create a unified model across all AD populations studied,  concentration data from children aged ≥6 
months to <6  years in studies R668-AD-1539 Part A and Part B were combined with data from adults, 
adolescents, and children ≥6 to <12 years. From the totality  of these data, a single base PopPK model 
incorporating both body weight  and maturation (age), was dev eloped to describe the  PK of dupilumab 
across all age groups. Overall, the the PopPK analysis included dupilumab concentration -time data from 
22 clinical studies (nine phase 1, six phase 2, one phase 2/3,  and six phase 3 studies).  The analysis 
included a total of 2873 unique  subjects ranging in age from 6 months  to 88 years (202 healthy 
volunteers and 2671  patients with  AD) and 20938  quantifiable PK samples. By age group, the population 
PK dataset included 2223  adults, 252  adolescents, 277 children  ≥6 to <12  years of age, and 121  children 
≥6 months to <6  years of age.  
A standard two-compartment  PopPK model with  parallel linear and nonlinear Michaelis -Menten  (MM) 
elimination and transit compartments to describe the  SC absorption of dupilumab  was utilized  in  each of 
the previous analyses. Body weight  is an important  predictor of dupilumab PK and a similar base model 
structure to the  prior models was used, that  included weight as a covariate. The previous models were 
parameterized in terms of inter-compartmental rate constants and elimination rate, whereas the current 
model used linear clearance (CL) and inter-compartmental clearance (Q) terms in order to implement a 
maturation function  on CL to describe age-related changes in clearance in children ≥ 6 months to < 6 
years of age. This maturation function  was also incorporated into  the  base model. Allometric exponents 
for the effects of body weight  on CL and Vc were estimated, instead of fixed to the standard values of 1 
and 0.75, respectively, as observed data we re available to characterize these relationships over a wide 
range of body weights. 
A full PopPK model was developed including simultaneous estimation of pre -specific covariate effects. 
Based on statistically significant  effects demonstrated in previous Po pPK models, several covariates of 
interest were evaluated in the current integrated model in addition  to the covariates of age and body 
weight  that were incorporated in the base model. The potential effects of age on central distribution 
volume and Ka were also tested  in the integrated model, since the current dataset includes pooled data to 
support testing  of these effects, which would not  have been possible in previous independent models 
developed for each age group. Following  a back -elimination procedure to eliminate covariates that were 
not statistically  significant at P <0.001,  a final PopPK model was obtained.  In addition to the  covariate 
effects included in  the base model of baseline body weight  on linear clearance and central volume, and of 
age on linear clearance, the following covariates were added in  the full model for evaluation: race (Black, 
Asian or Other race [reference: White]), ADA status  (low titer level or moderate/high titer levels 
[reference: ADA negative/non-positive]), baseline EASI score (reference: 30) and baseline albumin 
(reference: 45 g/L) on linear clearance; baseline age (reference: 30 years), race (Black, Asian or Other 
race [reference: White]), baseline EASI score (reference: 30), and baseline albumin (reference: 45 g/L) 
on volume of the central compartment; and age (reference: 30 years) on Ka. Reference conditions for 
continuous covariates were the  approximate median values in the  analysis population.  
After backward elimination, a final parsimonious model was identified. In addi tion to  effects of 
bodyweight and age included in the  base model, the  final model included covariates of: Black race, Asian 
race, low and moderate/high ADA titer level, EASI score, and baseline albumin on CL; and age, Black 
race, Asian race and EASI score on Vc (see Table  6 below). 
Primary PK parameters were well estimated with  relative standard error [RSE] <30%. IIV was modest for 
CL (32.5%  coefficient of variation [CV]) and Vc (32.2% CV). Any age -related effects on clearance due to 
maturation are anticipated  to be realized by approximately 6 years of age.

AD patients  between ≥5 to <15  kg are projected to have lower mean linear clearance (0.024 L/day), than 
those that  are between ≥15 to <30 kg (0.038  L/day). Overall, the mean linear clearance and central 
volume for the pediatric patients with  AD in studies R668-AD-1539  Part A and Part B (CL  = 0.032 L/day;

Model diagnostics 
Several parameters were estimated from dense PK sampling data in  adults and later fixed in the model 
including F1  (0.61)  and nonlinear clearance parameters: Vmax (1.24 mg/L/day) and Km (2.33 mg/L). 
Primary PK parameters were well estimated with  relative standard error [RSE] <30%. IIV was modest for 
CL (32.5%  coefficient of variation [CV]) and Vc (32.2% CV). The model was stable with  a condition 
number of 25,  which is well below the threshold value of 1000.  ETA shrinkage was low for CL (12.5%) 
and Vc (20.8%).  The estimated exponents describing the relationships of PK parameters with body weight 
were 0.751  for CL and 1.25  for Vc, which are similar to the  theoretical a llometric scaling values of 0.75 
and 1, respectively. The final model estimated the fraction of adult  clearance that is present at birth to be

Exposure predictions and PK comparison across populations  
In prior population  PK analyses the PK of dupilumab was consistent across healthy volunteers and 
patients with  AD, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with  nasal polyps (CRSwNP), suggesting a lack of 
effect of underlying disease on the PK of dupilumab (POH0611  and POH0668).  Body weight  is the  primary 
covariate influencing the PK of dupilumab. After accounting for body weight  there were no additional 
notable age-associated difference in the PK of dupilumab observed between adults, adolescents and 
children ≥6 to  <12 years of age with  AD or adult and adolescent patients  with asthma.  
The dosing regimen investigated in the pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B was a fixed, weight-tiered 
dupilumab regimen administered every 4 weeks (Q4W; 200 mg Q4W for patients  with  body weight  of ≥5 
to <15  kg at baseline, and 300 mg Q4W patients with  body weight of  ≥15 to <30 kg at baseline). 
Selection of the dose regimens in R668-AD-1539  Part B was informed by simulations from a PopPK model 
characterizing pharmacokinetic data for pediatric patients  with  AD, including children ≥6 months to <6 
years old from study R668-AD-1539  Part A. The goal of dose selection for study R668-AD-1539 Part B 
was to achieve dupilumab steady state exposure in pediatric patients aged ≥6 months  to <6 years within 
the range of exposures in adults, adolescents, and children ≥6 to <12  years of age where tolerability and 
efficacy have been demonstrated. 
Dupilumab is approved in the EU for adults (300 mg Q2W) and adolescents ≥12 to  <18 years of age (200 
mg Q2W in patients  <60 kg and 300  mg Q2W in patients ≥60 kg) with  moderate-to-severe AD and 
children ≥6 to  <12 years (300 mg Q4W in  patients ≥15 to <60 kg and 300 mg Q2W in  patients ≥60 kg) 
with  severe AD. The dose may be increased to 200 mg Q2W in patients  with body weight of 15 kg to <60 
kg based on physician’s assessment. The 300 mg QW dose regimen in adults, the  highest regimen that 
was studied and which demonstrated a favorable safety profile, was included as an additional reference.  
Comparisons for the  PK of dupilumab in children ≥6 months to <6 years of age treated with  dupilumab 
200 mg Q4W in  patients ≥5 to <15 kg or 300 mg Q4W in patients ≥15 to  <30 kg to older populations 
were based on: 1) Observed concentration-time profiles of functional dupilumab and Ctrough at week 16 in 
pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B for children ≥6 months to <6 years of age or in phase 2 and 3  studies 
in adults, adolescents, and children ≥6 to <12  years of age with AD; 2) Predicted exposure metrics 
(Cmax, AUC, and Ctrough at steady-state) for dupilumab in adults,  adolescents, children ≥6 to  <12 years of 
age, and children ≥6 months to <6  years of age based on the integrated final population PK model.

Adult data were pooled from phase 2b dose ranging study R668-AD-1021  and phase 3 studies R668-AD-
1224,  R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416,  and R668-AD-1424. 
Data in adolescents and children ≥6 to <12  years of age were from phase 3 studies R668-AD-1526  and 
R668-AD-1652,  respectively. In children ≥6 to  <12 years of age weighing ≥15 to <60  kg, the approved 
posology in the EU  of 300  mg Q4W includes a loading dose of 300  mg administered on days 1 and 15, 
whereas a loading dose of 600 mg was administered on day 1 in this age group in  the pivotal study. 
The final PopPK model was used to simulate the median and the 5th and 95th  percentiles of  dupilumab 
concentration over time in children aged ≥6 months to  <6 years receiving dupilumab 200 mg Q4W 
(patients ≥5 to <15  kg) or 300  mg Q4W (patients ≥15 to <30  kg), as well as for the approved regimens in 
adults, adolescents, and children ≥6 to <12  years of age with  AD, and to assess the sources of variability. 
Post-hoc steady-state exposure metrics were summarized including  Ctrough,ss, maximum concentration 
(Cmax,ss), area under the curve (AUC) over a given dosing interval (AUCτ,ss), and AUC over a 4 week 
dosing period (AUC4weeks,ss) to  allow for exposure comparisons between dosing regimens of differing 
intervals across age groups.  
Observed Ctrough at week 16 and PopPK model derived exposure metrics were compared for the  Q4W 
regimens in patients  ≥6 months  to <6 years of age to the  approved regimens in adults, adolescents, and 
children ≥6 to  <12 years of age with  AD.

Absorption 
Dupilumab is well absorbed after SC administration, with  a reported bioavailability of 61 to 64%.    
The extent of absorption (bioavailability ) in children was not  estimated due to  lack of intravenous (IV) 
data, but  was fixed to 61% for the target population (see population PK model) 
Age was not a statistically  significant covariate on absorption rate (Ka) when assessed in the full PopPK 
model. 
The rate of absorption was estimated in  children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age to 0.341  (1/d).   
Mean Cmax values were generally similar (≤25% difference) for the 2 to <6 years of age cohort compared 
to the 6  months to <2 years of age cohort at each dose level and median t max was observed

approximately 2 days after dosing for all cohorts, and suggest similar absorption kinetics between the  age 
cohorts in study R668-AD-1539 Part A. 
Distribution 
Children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age have a smaller body size and volume  of distribution  than older 
populations. Mean post-hoc estimates of the apparent central compartment volume of distribution  (V c) 
were lower for children ≥6 months to <6  years of age (0.24 L for ≥5 to <15 kg or 0.47 L for ≥15 to <30 
kg) than the reference of 2.99  L in a 70 kg adult (Table  7). 
Elimination 
The PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with  parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways 
(target-mediated clearance), with  the target-mediated pathway expressing a high degree of nonlinearity. 
The time for dupilumab concentrations to decrease below the lower limit  of quantitation  (LLOQ; 0.078 
mg/L) after cessation of dosing was determined across populations with  AD using  the final PopPK model. 
Consistent with  the effects of weight  and age on clearance, this duration was similar in adults or 
adolescents, but  longer in children:  
After the last steady-state dose of various dosing regimen, the median times to non-detectable 
concentration ranged from 9 to 13 weeks in  adults and pediatric patients  12 to 17 years of age, and are 
approximately 1.5 times and 2.5 times longer in pediatric patients 6 to <12  years of age and pediatric 
patients <6  years old, respectively. 
Clearance in children <6  years of age was less than would  be expected from allometrically scaled values 
in older populations, but did not  require additional adjustment to the  weight-tiered dose regimens. Based 
on the final PopPK model, after accounting  for differences in body weight,  increasing age was associa ted 
with  increasing clearance in children. Age -related differences in clearance observed in the younger 
children were accounted for by a maturation function, where linear clearance increases with  age. At 6 
months of age, children exhibit approximately 40% of allometrically scaled adult  clearance. Clearance 
matures asymptotically and reaches ≥95% of allometrically scale adult clearance by approximately 6 
years of age.  
Age did not  affect clearance of dupilumab in pediatric subjects ≥6 to <18  years of age or in adults. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Dupilumab, like many other monoclonal antibodies targeting endogenous receptors, is characterized by 
linear and nonlinear target-mediated kinetics. This nonlinear PK profile is typically observed at drug 
concentrations below that required to  saturate the  target-mediated pathway, resulting in a greater than 
dose proportional increase in exposure (initial adult  AD marketing application).  As drug concentrations 
increase to levels greater than  those required to saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK profile 
reverts to a linear and dose-proportional profile. For the regimens in R668-AD-1539  Part B, most patients 
exhibit exposures in the linear range throughout  the treatment period.   
Steady  state  and Accumulation 
Mean dupilumab Ctrough in patients ≥15  to <30 kg receiving dupilumab 300  mg Q4W  or patients ≥5  to 
<15 kg received dupilumab 200 mg Q4W in study R668-AD-1539  Part B reached steady-state by week 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023

16. Dupilumab Ctrough at week 16 was approximately 2-fold of Ctrough at week 4 after the  first dose for both 
regimens (Table 10). 
Notably, the time  to achieve steady state in the  ≥6 months to <6-year-old patients receiving dupilumab 
at a Q4W interval is most similar to that  observed in adult patients receiving dupilumab 300  mg QW. This 
observation is consistent with  the non-linear clearance of dupilumab and the exposure achieved in the ≥6 
months to <6  year old patient population, compared to adults.  At week 4, mean Ctrough values in children 
≥6 months  to <6 years of age was lower than  observed for children ≥6 to  <12  years, but were similar to 
concentrations for the  approved regimens in adults receiving 300 mg Q2W and adolesc ents receiving 200 
mg Q2W or 300 mg Q2W. At week 8,  concentrations in children ≥6  months to <6 years of age continued 
to increase and were similar to observations in children ≥6 to <12  years of age and higher than  observed 
in adults and adolescents on approved dose regimens. In children ≥6  months to <6 years, systemic 
concentrations of dupilumab in the 300 mg Q4W group appeared to have reached steady -state by week 
12, while  the highest mean concentrations for the 200 mg Q4W group were observed at week 16  ( Figure 
8). 
To assess the potential for continued accumulation beyond the 16  weeks of treatment  evaluated in study 
R668-AD-1539 Part B, dupilumab Ctrough was compared for patients that  received the same regimen of 
dupilumab 200  or 300  mg Q4W in  study R668-AD-1539 Part B and study R668-AD-1434  in the OLE. In 
the subset of patients with  <6 weeks of treatment gap between the last dose in R668 -AD-1539 Part B 
and the first dose in  R668-AD-1434, mean±SD dupilumab Ctrough at week 16  in the OLE (eg, after 
approximately 32 weeks of continuous treatment) for 300 mg Q4W (96.8±21.1  mg/L) or 200 mg Q4W 
(146±34.1 mg/L)  were similar to Ctrough at week 16 in R668-AD-1539  Part B for 300 mg Q4W (92.3±32.6 
mg/L) or 200 mg Q4W (137±40.4  mg/L), illustrating  that  steady -state concentrations were achieved for 
both regimens after ≤16  weeks of treatment  and maintained over the  duration of the  OLE study.

Loading dose  
In adults, adolescents, and children ≥6 to  <12 years of age with  AD, dupilumab is administered  with a 
loading dose. The loading dose was intended to reduce the  time required to reach effective concentrations 
of dupilumab. Children ≥6 months to <6  years of age have a smaller body size and volume  of distribution 
than older populations and were expected to achieve high exposures following an initial  SC injection of 
200 or 300 mg dupilumab without  a loading dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 36/183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was also interest  to limit the  number of injections upon initiation  of treatment in this  younger 
population. Thus, a loading dose of dupilumab was not included in the  dosing regimen  for children ≥6 
months to <6  years of age with AD receiving dupilumab 200 mg Q4W or 300 mg Q4W in study R668-AD-
1539  Part B. The inclusion or omission of a loading dose does not impact exposure at steady -state for any 
dose regimen, but patients  may take longer to achieve steady -state without  the loading dose (Figure 9). 
Nonetheless, mean concentrations of dupilumab at week 4 in  children ≥6  months to <6 years of age 
receiving dupilumab 200 mg Q4W or 300 mg Q4W in  study  R668-AD-1539 Part B were similar to 
approved regimens administered with  a loading dose in adults (300  mg Q2W with  a 600  mg loading dose) 
and adolescents (300  mg Q2W  with a 600 mg loading dose or 200  mg Q2W  with a 400 mg loading dose). 
Rapid attainment of effective concentrations suggests that omission of a loading dose did not adversely 
affect evaluation of dupilumab in this  patient population.

Body weight  is the primary covariate affecting the  pharmacokinetics of dupilumab. The weight-tiered 
fixed dosing regimens were used to  reduce the differences in exposure associated with weight  across 
pediatric populations. In patients ≥6 months  to <6 years of age, dupilumab regimens of 300  mg Q4W in 
patients ≥15  to <30  kg and 200 mg Q4W in  patients ≥5 to  <15 kg exhibited Ctrough at week 16 that  was 
similar between weight  groups for this age category, and similar to  or higher than those observed for the 
approved regimens in older AD patients (Figure 9). 
Age 
When assessed in the full PopPK model, age was not a statistically  significant covariate on absorpt ion rate 
(Ka). After accounting  for differences in body weight,  increasing age was associated with increasing

clearance in children <6 years of age but did not  require adjustment to the dose regimen. Incorporation 
of the age-related effect results in  lower predicted clearance, between the ages of 6  months to 6 years 
(also refer to the topic Elimination).   
In contrast, age did not  affect clearance of dupilumab in pediatric subjects ≥6 to <18  years of age or in 
adults.  
Other Covariates  
The PopPK model also included covariate effects for race, baseline albumin concentration, baseline EASI 
score, and ADA status on dupilumab pharmacokinetics. Black or Asian race, lower albumin, higher EASI 
score, and low titer or moderate/high titer ADA sta tus were associated with  decreased exposure to 
dupilumab in patients  with AD. Most of these findings, however, only resulted in small numerical 
differences (Figure 10). While ADA positive patients were associated with  lower exposure to dupilumab , 
the immunogenicity of dupilumab in children ≥6 months to <6 years of age was low in study R668-AD-
1539  Part B and no patients with  moderate or high titers wer e observed (also refer to section 
Immunogenicity). 
Race (Asian race/Black race) 
Based on the population PK analysis, Asian and Black race were associated with  lower exposure to 
dupilumab than White  race in patients with  AD. However, variability in  dupilumab exposure in  children ≥6 
months to <6  years of age due to  race was less than va riability due to body weight  and age and the 
effect of race on exposure to dupilumab resulted in only small numerical differences.  
Treatment-Emergent ADA (low, moderate/high titers) 
Discussed within  section Immunogenicity. 
Baseline Disease Activity 
Based on the population PK analysis, higher EASI score at baseline was associated with  decreased 
exposure to dupilumab in patients with  AD. However, variability in  dupilumab exposure in children ≥6 
months to <6  years of age due to  baseline EASI score was less tha n  variability due to body weight and 
age and the effect of baseline disease activity on exposure to dupilumab resulted in  only small numerical 
differences.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin-G4 (IgG4) antibody that inhibits  interleukin-4 (IL-4) 
and interleukin-13 (IL-13)  signaling by specifically binding  to the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) sub-unit 
shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. 
Dupilumab inhibits  IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL 4Rα/γc), and both  IL-4 and IL-13 signaling 
through the  Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα).  Blocking IL-4Rα with  dupilumab inhibits  IL-4 and IL-13 
cytokine- induced responses, including  the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IgE.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
TARC 
Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) percent change from baseline over time  was 
analyzed as a biomarker of dupilumab pharmacodynamic activity in patients  with AD.  
Pharmacodynamic profiles of TARC in children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age show a similar median 
magnitude of effect over time by dose regimen to that  of dose  regimens evaluated in adults,  adolescents, 
and children ≥6 to  <12 years of age (Figure 11). Concentrations of TARC in serum rapidly decreased, 
approached a nadir by week 4, and remained suppressed throughout  the 16 -week treatment period for all 
studied dose regimens except 100 mg Q4W (400  mg loading dose) evaluated in  adults as part of phase 
2b dose-ranging study  R668-AD-1021.

Immunogenicity 
As with all monoclonal antibodies, dupilumab has the  potential to induce ADAs. Therefore, serum samples 
for immunogenicity assessment were collected from all studies, and titer levels were provided for the ADA 
positive samples. Samples that  were positive in the ADA assay were also examined for NAb activity. 
The pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B was the primary source for the immunogenicity assessment of 
dupilumab in children aged ≥6 months to  <6 years with AD, as it  was the largest randomized, controlled 
study in this  population. Patients were treated for 16 weeks with  the dupilumab dosing regimens 
proposed for use in this  patient population.   
Single-dose study R668-AD-1539  Part A contributed further data on the immunogenicity profile of 
dupilumab when administered to children aged ≥6 months to <6  years with AD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023

The OLE study (R668-AD-1434)  allowed additional longitudinal  monitoring of ADA responses over time of 
patients enrolled from parental study R668-AD-1539 Part A and Part B. 
The ADA status and category of each patient  was classified as one of the following:   
•  Negative - If all samples are found to be negative in the ADA assay  
• 
Pre-existing – if the  baseline sample is positive and all post  baseline ADA titers are reported as 
less than  4-fold the baseline titer  value 
• 
Treatment-boosted - A positive result at baseline in the  ADA assay with at least 1 post baseline 
titer result ≥4-fold  the baseline titer  value 
• 
Treatment-emergent - A negative result or missing result at baseline with  at leas t 1 positive post 
baseline result in the  ADA assay 
o  Persistent - A positive result in the ADA assay detected in at least 2 consecutive post 
baseline samples separated by at least a 12-week post baseline period [based on nominal 
sampling time], with  no ADA-negative results in-between, regardless of any missing 
samples 
o 
Indeterminate -  A positive result in the ADA assay at the last collection time point  only, 
regardless of any missing samples 
o  Transient - Not persistent or indeterminate, regardless of any missing samples 
In addition, the maximum response titers for each patient are categorized as High/Moderate/Low:     
• 
Low (titer  <1,000) 
•  Moderate (1,000≤  titer ≤10,000) 
•  High  (titer >10,000) 
The anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis set includes all treated patients who received any study drug and 
who had at least 1 non-missing ADA result after the first dose of the study drug. 
The neutralizing antibody (NAb) analysis set includes all treated patients who received any study drug, 
had at least 1 non-missing ADA result following the first dose of study drug, and either tested negative at 
all ADA sampling times or tested positive for ADA with at least 1 non-missing Nab  result after first dose of 
the study drug. For patients  with at  least 1 non-missing  ADA result after the first dose of study drug and 
whose ADA assay results were all negative, all NAb results were imputed  as negative and the  patients 
were included as NAb negative in  the NAb analysis set. 
R668-AD-1539  Part A (Phase  2, Open-label,  Single Ascending Dose Study) 
A total of 40 patients were included in the ADA analysis set. ADA samples were collected at  baseline, day 
8 and day 29.   
19 out  of 40  (47.5%) patients  developed a treatment-emergent ADA response and 1 (2.5%) patient 
developed a treatment-boosted ADA response following a single dose of 3 or 6 mg/kg dupilumab. The 
incidence of ADA to dupilumab  in Part A was similar irrespective of dupilumab dose or age cohort. Positive 
NAb responses were observed in 11 (27.5%)  patients in this  study following a single dose . Most  patients 
with  a treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA response exhibited low ADA titers (Table 13, 
Table 14 and Table 15).

The rate of observed ADA response is higher in patients  in the single -dose study R668-AD-1539  Part A 
compared to Part B (47.5 % vs. 1.4%, respectively).  
The development of high rates of ADA was previously observed in adolescents and children ≥6 to <12 
years of age following administration of a single low dose of dupilumab 2 or 4 mg/kg (followed by an 8-
week observation period to assess PK, followed by 4 additional weekly dos es) in study R668-AD-1412  and 
appear to be a function of study design rather than  a characteristic of the  patient population. This dosing 
regimen invoked a significant ADA response (56,8%  positive response in the ADA assay at any time), 
with  some patients having moderate or high, and those were associated with  a substantial reduction in 
detectable drug concentrations and a lack of notable improvement in EASI score. With  continued 
treatment through  Part B of study R668-AD-1412, and subsequently in the OLE study R668-AD-1434,  a 
decline in ADA titers and a corresponding increase in systemic concentrations of dupilumab as well as an 
improvement in the  EASI percent change from baseline. In conclusion from these observations, a single 
dose of dupilumab, +/-  rechallenge after a prolonged pause, may lead to a “prime and boost” immune 
response to dupilumab. Nevertheless, with  continued treatment,  efficacy can be restored.  
Lower rates of ADA were observed, in contrast, in pivotal studies with  multiple  doses of dupilum ab  over a 
16-week treatment period for adolescents and children ≥6 to  <12 years of age. 
Impact of Anti-drug  Antibodies on Dupilumab  Concentrations 
In study R668-AD-1539 Part A, dupilumab concentration-time profiles in ADA and/or NAb positive 
patients were within  the range observed in ADA-negative patients (Figure 12).

A total of 143 patients  were included in the ADA analysis set.  ADA samples were collected at baseline, 
EOT, and EOS in  case not entering the OLE. 
The rate of treatment-emergent ADA responses was low in  patients who received multiple doses of 
dupilumab 200  mg, dupilumab 300 mg, or placebo Q4W in study R668-AD-1539  Part B. 
Among patients that  received active drug, only 1 patient  in the 300  mg dupilumab  group developed a 
treatment-emergent ADA response (1.4%, 1/74).  That patient  exhibited a low titer,  indeterminate 
response and was negative for neutralizing  antibodies. No other ADA responses (e.g., treatment-boosted) 
were observed in this  study (Table 16).

Impact of Anti-drug  Antibodies on Dupilumab  Concentrations 
Due to  the low frequency of treatment-emergent ADA responses, it  was not  feasible to assess 
associations between immunogenicity and concentrations of functional  dupilumab in study R668 -AD-1539 
Part B.  
R668-AD-1434  (Phase 3, Open-label,  Long-term Extension Study) 
A total of 151 patients  were included in the ADA analysis set.  ADA samples were collected at baseline and 
at sparse timepoints  thereafter including weeks 16,  52, 76, 104,  152,  200, 260/EOT,  and at  week 
272/EOS. 
Immunogenicity status in study R668-AD-1434  was determined relative to baseline in the previous study.  
Of the 161 patients  who received study drug in R668-AD-1539  Part B, 144  patients ≥ 6 months to <6 
years of age enrolled in the  OLE study R668-AD-1434, where all patients started or continued weight-
tiered dupilumab regimens of 200 mg Q4W in patients  ≥5 to  <15 kg or 300  mg Q4W in patients ≥15 to 
<30 kg. Immunogenicity of dupilumab for patients  who rolled over from R668-AD-1539 Part B was 
consistent with  the parent study. In data available as of the interim analysis, the rate of treatment-
emergent ADA responses remained low for patients who received multiple doses of dupilumab 200  mg, 
dupilumab 300  mg, or placebo Q4W in  previous study R668-AD-1539 Part B (1.7%,  2/116);  the 2 ADA 
positive patients exhibited a low  titer, indeterminate response and were negative for NAbs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 48/183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A higher rate of treatment-emergent ADA responses (57.1%, 20/35)  was observed in study R668-AD-
1434  for patients who  entered from the  study R668-AD-1539 Part A. 
Samples positive for treatment-emergent ADA were detected for 19 of these patients  after receiving a 
single dose of dupilumab 3 or 6 mg/kg in  the previous study; one patient who was negative in  the 
previous study had a transient, treatment-treatment  ADA response at week 16 in study R668-AD-1434. 
Most  ADA positive patients  from study R668-AD-1539 Part A exhibited responses in the  current study  that 
were transient  (37.1%, 13/35),  low titer  (42.9%,  15/35), and positive for NAbs (31.4%,  11/34);  3 
moderate titer  and 1 high  titer responses were observed and all moderate/high titer responses were in 
patients that  initially received a single dose of dupilumab 3 mg/kg which  was the lowest dose evaluated in 
study R668-AD-1539 Part A. The single patient  exhibiting a high titer  response in  R668-AD-1434 had a 
modest reduction in titer levels throughout  the study. The higher rate of ADA response in patients  in 
R668-AD-1539 Part A compared to Part B may be a function of study design. 
Impact of Anti-drug  Antibodies on Dupilumab  Concentrations and on Concentration-Response 
In study R668-AD-1434, the  distribution of dupilumab concentrations for ADA positive patients  ≥6 months 
to <6  years of age with  a low maximum titer  was within  the range of concentrations  observed in ADA 
negative patients.  In patients with  a moderate titer response, dupilumab concentrations at week 16  were 
lower than in patients with  low titer  responses or patients who  were ADA negative, but  were similar 
between these groups by week 52. In parallel, an improvement in efficacy (EAS I score) was observed. 
The single patient exhibiting a high titer  response in R668-AD-1434 had undetectable concentrations of 
dupilumab throughout  the study.  EASI scores gradually declined in this  patient over a span of 3 years, 
but  the rate of improvement was slower than in patients with  moderate titers.  These data suggest that 
with  continued dupilumab treatment a portion of patients can be treated through  this moderate ADA 
response with  restoration of efficacy. 
The association between exposure and ADA is consistent  with PopPK calculations, at  least for patients 
with  moderate or high ADA levels, and could be due to lower drug concentrations being more 
immunogenic, or due to the  presence of ADA increasing the  clearance of drug.  
In parallel to the required update for PK data of this  study, the applicant further submitted  an actualized 
analysis of the data on immunogenicity of dupilumab in children of the  age group in focus for the OLE 
study R668-AD-1434 with  a new data cut-off of 10-Mar-2022.  The results of analyses were consistent 
with  prior analyses.  
2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Drug effect increased with  increasing quartile of Ctrough of dupilumab (Figure 14).  Logistic regression of 
the probability of patients achieving IGA 0  or 1 versus dupilumab C trough in patients  on active drug 
supported a positive correlation between dupilumab exposure and r esponse as measured by IGA 0 or 1 
and this trend was consistent across all age groups within  the dupilumab AD program ( Figure 15).

EASI 
Proportion of patients  with EASI-75 
Proportion of patients  with EASI-75 at week 16  is another key efficacy endpoint of study R688-AD-1539.   
Exposure-response relationships for the proportion of patients achieving EASI -75 were similar to the 
proportion of patients  achieving IGA 0 or 1. In an analysis of response by quartiles of dupilumab  exposure 
over time, early separation was observed be tween patients on dupilumab relative to placebo with a clear 
rank ordering by dupilumab Ctrough at week 16  (Figure 16). Logistic regression of the probability of 
achieving EASI-75 versus dupilumab Ctrough at week 16 supported a positive correlation between higher 
dupilumab exposure and a greater probability of attaining  EASI-75. In E-R analyses conducted 
independently for adults,  adolescents, children ≥6 to  <12 years of age, and children ≥6 months  to <6 
years with  AD, positive relationships were apparent in all age groups (Figure 17).

data are available to inform steady-state E-R relationships at lower concentrations in this age group. The 
apparent differences in shape of the E-R relationship for dupilumab with  EASI (percent change from 
baseline) in  children 6 months  to <6 years of age relative to older populations may be due to the limited 
data informing this relationship at low dupilumab exposure in study R668-AD-1539  Part B (Figure 19, 
Figure 20).

Exposure-Response for Weekly  Average of Daily Worst Scratch/Itch NRS  
Positive correlations between dupilumab concentrations versus weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch 
NRS percent change from baseline at week 16 were observed for adults, adolescents, children ≥6 to <12 
years of age, and children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age (Figure 21). These relationships were generally 
described by a rapid improvement at lower concentrations and a  plateauing of improvement at higher 
dupilumab concentrations. In children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age, the weekly average of daily worst 
scratch/itch score improved with  increasing dupilumab  concentrations for patients below approximately 
100 mg/L,  while a shallower slope in  the relationship was obser ved at higher concentrations.  
As with other E-R relationships for efficacy endpoints in these children, characterization of the full E -R 
relationship is limited by the sparsity of patients with  dupilumab C trough at week 16  <50 mg/L.  
Daily worst scratch/itch  was a patient  report measurement in adults,  adolescents, and children ≥6 to <12 
years of age, and was a caregiver reported measure in children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age. The 
differing nature of this  instrument in the  youngest children limits  the inferences that can be made by 
direct comparison of these relationships across age groups.

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods 
The method applied for the detection of functional dupilumab correspond s to the method used in the 
initial  marketing authorisation application for AD and this method has been accurately validated 
(REGN668-AV-13074-VA01V1).  Incurred sample reanalysis performed for both parts of study R668-AD-
1539  confirmed that  the assay also produced robust and reproducible results in the younger paediatric AD 
population ≥6 months to <6  years of age. 
Methods applied for the detection of anti-dupilumab antibodies and neutralising antibodies also 
correspond to the methods already utilized and described in  previous EU applications for dupilumab.

Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH seeks a change in the  target indication to include children aged ≥6 months to  <6 years with 
severe AD.  
The package on clinical pharmacology regarding children of this age group with  severe A D comprises 3 
dupilumab clinical studies where PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) data have been collected. A phase 3 
pivotal study (R668-AD-1539 Part B) was conducted with patients  of this  age group and the results of two 
further studies, R668-AD-1539 Part A (Phase 2 PK) and R668-AD-1434 (OLE),  providing further 
supporting data.  
In the single-dose PK-study R668-AD-1539 Part A, dupilumab SC dosing regimens of 3 mg/kg and 6 
mg/kg were evaluated, whereas in  the pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B SC dosing regimens of 200 mg 
Q4W and 300 mg Q4W for children weighing ≥5 to <15 kg and ≥15 to <30 kg, respectively, were 
assessed. In contrast  to the older age groups, neither loading doses of dupilumab were administered to 
children of this  age group, nor a more intense dosing interval was used.  
Open-label extension (OLE) study R668-AD-1434  is an ongoing study which  includes patients ≥6 months 
to <18  years of age that rolled over from different AD studies, including  patients of study R668 -AD-1539 
Part A and Part B. This study provided further data on long-term use of dupilumab.  
At the time of the PK/ADA data cutoff date (23 Jul  2021) 84 patients  were included in the  PK analysis set 
of the OLE study R668-AD-1434  with only a few data on the  200 mg Q4W and 300 mg Q4W r egimes at 
the later time points (week 56 and thereafter). An updated PK analysis of study R668-AD-1434 was 
submitted  with the  data cut-off  date of 10-Mar-2022,  now  including data of 167 patients and sufficient 
data at week 52.  Data were consistent with  the  data gained from former analyses. 
Dupilumab concentration-time profiles are described by target-mediated disposition and were generally 
characterized by a brief absorption phase after SC administration, followed by a linear elimination phase 
and a terminal target-mediated elimination phase. The linear phase was more prominent for the 6 mg/kg 
dose cohorts of study R668-AD-1539 Part A and suggested that  saturation of target-mediated pathway 
achieved in the 3 mg/kg dose cohorts may be limited in duration.  Dup ilumab was measurable in serum 
for a longer duration in the 2 to  <6 years of age cohort than in the 6 months  to <2 years of age cohort at 
both mg/kg dose levels, suggesting higher clearance per unit body weight in children <2 years of age.  
Mean concentrations of dupilumab over time exhibited similar profiles in patients  receiving weight-tired 
dupilumab 200  mg Q4W and 300  mg Q4W respectively. Systemic concentrations of dupilumab in the  300 
mg Q4W group appeared to have reached steady -state by week 12,  while the highest mean 
concentrations for the  200 mg Q4W group were observed at week 16. Accumulation of dupilumab C trough 
at week 16  relative to after the initial dose at week 4 was approximately 2-fold for both  dupilumab 
regimens.  
The weight-tiered dosing regimen of dupilumab evaluated in this  study (R668-AD—1539  Part B) 
normalized dupilumab exposure across patients of differing body weight  categories (≥5 to <15  kg and 
≥15 to  <30 kg, respectively). Mean ± SD dupilumab Ctrough at week 16  was similar between patients ≥5 
to <15  kg receiving 200  mg Q4W (109 ± 50.8  mg/L) and patients  ≥15 to  <30 kg  receiving 300 mg Q4W 
(110  ± 42.8 mg/L).  This information has been added in section 5.2  of the  SmPC. 
The extent of absorption (Bioavailability, F)  was not estimated in children ≥6 months to  <12 years 
population due to the lack of intravenous (IV) data. The absorption rate Ka was estimated based on PK 
data. 
Mean post-hoc estimates of the  apparent central compartment volume of distribution  (Vc) were lower for 
children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age (0.24 L  for ≥5 to  <15 kg or 0.47  L for ≥15 to <30  kg) than  the 
reference of 2.99  L in a 70 kg adult.

The PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with  parallel linear and nonlinear elimination pathways 
(target-mediated clearance).  
Clearance in children <6  years of age was less than would  be expected from allometrically scaled values 
in older populations. Based on the final PopPK model, after accounting for differences in body weight, 
increasing age was associated with increasing clearance in children. After the last steady-state dose of 
various dosing regimen, the  median times to non-detectable concentration ranged from 9 to 13 weeks in 
adults and paediatric patients 12 to 17  years of age, and are approximately 1.5 times and 2 .5 times 
longer in paediatric patients 6  to <12 years of age and paediatric patients  <6 years old, respectively. This 
information has been adequately reflected in  SmPC section 5.2. 
Mean post-hoc estimates of the  clearance were 0.024 L/d  for children weighing ≥5  to <15 kg and 0.038 
L/d for children weighing ≥15 to  <30 kg, respectively, with a reference value of 0.0959  L/d in  a 70 kg 
adult. 
Mean dupilumab Ctrough in patients ≥15  to <30 kg receiving dupilumab 300  mg Q4W  or patients ≥5  to 
<15 kg received dupilumab 200 mg Q4W in study R668-AD-1539  Part B reached steady-state by week 
16. Dupilumab Ctrough at week 16 was approximately 2-fold of Ctrough at week 4 after the  first dose for both 
regimens. 
In contrast to adults, adolescents, and children ≥6  to <12 years  of age with  AD, no loading dose of 
dupilumab was included in the dosing regimen for children ≥6 months to <6  years of age. Mean 
concentrations of dupilumab at week 4 were similar to approved regimens administered with a loading 
dose in  adults and adolescents. The rapid attainment  of effective concentrations suggests that  omission of 
a loading dose did not adversely affect evaluation of dupilumab in  this patient  population.  
Population PK 
PopPK analysis was conducted by the use of standard software (NONMEM)  in combination  with R for pre- 
and post-processing of data, which is endorsed. 
An integrated PopPK model was developed to describe the concentrations of dupilumab across age groups 
from adults  to children as young as 6  months of age with  AD. Therefore, concentration data from children 
aged ≥6  months to <6  years in studies R668-AD-1539  Part A and Part B were combined with  data from 
adults, adolescents, and children ≥6 to  <12 years. From the totality  of these data, a single base PopPK 
model incorporating both  body weight  and maturation  (age), was developed to describe the PK of 
dupilumab across all age groups.  
Overall, the PopPK analysis included dupilumab  concentration-time data from 22 clinical studies (nine 
phase 1,  six phase 2, one phase 2/3, and six phase 3 studies). The analysis included a total of 2873 
unique subjects ranging in age from 6 months to 88  years (202 healthy volunteers and 2671 patients 
with  AD) and 20938  quantifiable PK samples. By age group, the population  PK dataset included 2223 
adults, 252  adolescents, 277 children ≥6 to  <12 years of age, and 121 children ≥6 months  to <6 years of 
age. 
The base model was identified in  an iterative procedure (Run1-Run18),  starting with  using data from 
adult and successively adding data from paediatric subgroups. This is in general agreed, however, several 
fixing of parameters, including those describing absorption needed to be fixed during  the base model 
selection process. After the inclusion of all age groups, IIV was included on Ka, but resulted in a high 
shrinkage value because most subjects, especially the paediatric subgroups, d id not  have informative 
data in the absorption phase. In consequence, IIV was only estimated on CL and Vc.  
Covariates of interest  to be tested  have been selected based on statistically significant effects 
demonstrated in previous PopPK models, in  addition to the covariates of age (maturation on CL)  and body 
weight  (estimated allometry on CL and V) that  were incorporated in the base model. The potential effects 
Assessment report

of age on central distribution  volume and Ka were also tested in the  integrated model, however, ot her 
parameters such as F,  accounting for absorption, have been fixed in advance to values mainly based on 
adult data. There was no prior forward inclusion step to the  stepwise backward elimination  step during 
covariate selection for the integrated model. 
The overall model structure is endorsed and in line with  findings based on previous pop PK. The change in 
parameterizing from rate-based to parameterization in terms of CL and V is appreciated in light  of the 
need of incorporating the maturation effect on C L. The assumption of a fix lower bioavailability (61% vs 
64%; although  comparable) and a lower ka (0.341  vs 0.641  1/day) in the youngest age group is not 
expected. Indeed, it  is assumed that  absorption is at least as well as observed in older age groups, w ith 
an expected increased absorption rate for mAbs in infants and young children compared to adults 
(Temrikar et al, 2020). 
The estimated exponents (95% CI) describing the relationships of PK parameters with body weight were 
0.751  (0.710,  0.793) for CL and 1.25 (1.128,  1.31)  for Vc. As these values are in  the range of the 
theoretical allometric scaling values of 0.75 and 1, respectively, the use of the estimated allometry is 
supported. 
The final model estimated the fraction of adult clearance that is presen t at birth  to be 0.198  and the 
clearance maturation half-life estimate (95% CI) was 1.13  (0.503,  1.76) years. Paediatric clearance is 
anticipated to reach that of an adult by approximately 6 years (~2.5-8.5  years) of age (5 half-lives).  
Thus, to ensure PK comparability, the  MAH was asked to provide an external validation of PK data 
collected from the paediatric subgroup 6 months  to 6 years by use of the previous model that was used 
to describe PK data from 6-12  years of age, re-parameterized (CL,V), allometric scaling and maturation 
effect included.  
Observed PK in the age group 6 month to 2 years of age and 2 years of age to 6 years of age were 
compared with  model-based exposure predictions (VPC plots  stratified by respective weight  bands 
correlating with  both  age groups). The requested VPC plots stratified by age groups indicate an adequate 
description of data by the pop PK model.  
The predictive performance of the final model was evaluated through VPC plots for Study R668 -AD-1539 
Part B, stratified  by dose, and additional  VPC plots stratified by study and dose level. The VPC plots 
provided indicate that  overall, the final model can explain dupilumab  concentration data, over the  16 -
week treatment period including young children (≥6 months to  <6 years of age ) with  AD in Study R668-
AD-1539 Part B following  multiple dose administration. 
PK comparison across populations 
It is agreed that  observed as well as model-predicted exposures were comparable for all age groups 
following weight-based tiered dosing regimens of dupilumab. Exposure following 300 mg Q4W and 200 
mg Q4W assuming the proposed weight bands of ≥15 kg to 30 kg and ≥5 kg to 15 kg, respectively, is up 
to 2-fold higher at steady state compared to children aged between 6-12 years. Nevertheless, the 
exposure range expected is not exceeding the observed range observed during the clinical development.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic profiles of TARC in children ≥6  months to <6  years of age show a similar effect over 
time (rapid decrease) compared to adults,  adolescents, and children ≥6 to <12  years of age.  
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity of dupilumab in  children aged 6 months to <6  years with moderate -to-severe AD 
receiving dupilumab 200 mg Q4W or 300 mg Q4W regimens was low,  with minimal impact of 
immunogenicity on dupilumab exposure in these patients.

In pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B, only one patient developed a low-titer treatment-emergent ADA 
response. Thus, it was not  feasible to assess associations between immunogenicity and concentrations of 
functional dupilumab in  this study population. 
The rate of observed ADA response was higher in patients  in the single -dose study R668-AD-1539  Part A 
compared to Part B (47.5 % vs. 1.4%, respectively) with  most patients exhibiting low ADA titers.  The 
development of high rates of ADA was previously observed in adolescents and children ≥6  to <12 years 
of age following administration  single low dose administration of dupilumab (followed by additional doses 
after a 8-week observation period) in study  R668-AD-1412 and appear to be a function  of study design - 
akin a “prime and boost” regimen. Dupilumab concentration-time profiles in  ADA and/or NAb positive 
patients were within  the range observed in ADA -negative patients. 
The rate of treatment-emergent ADA responses remained low in OLE study R668-AD-1434  for patients 
who received multiple doses of dupilumab or placebo Q4W in previous study R668 -AD-1539  Part B (1.7%, 
2/116);  both patients  had low  titer, indeterminate response and were negative for NAbs.   
A higher rate of treatment-emergent ADA responses (57.1%, 20/35)  was observed in the  OLE study 
R668-AD-1434 for patients who entered from the  study R668-AD-1539 Part A. Most  responses in the 
current study were transient (37.1%,  13/35),  low titer  (42.9%, 15/35),  and positiv e for NAbs (31.4%, 
11/34);  3 moderate titer  and 1 high  titer responses were observed.  
In the longitudinal  assessment, dupilumab concentrations of patients  with  a moderate titer  response at 
week 16 were lower than  in patients with  low titer  responses or pa tients who were ADA negative, but 
were similar between the groups by week 52.  In parallel, an improvement in efficacy (EASI score) was 
observed. 
The single patient that  exhibited a high titer  response and had undetectable concentrations of  dupilumab 
throughout  the study. EASI scores improved gradually, but  the rate of improvement was slower in that 
patient than  in patients with  moderate titers.  Overall, these data suggest that  with  continued treatment a 
portion of patients can be treated through  a moderate (or high)  ADA response with restoration of efficacy. 
In parallel to the required update for PK data of this  study, the  MAH  further submitted an actualized 
analysis of the data on immunogenicity of dupilumab in children of the  age group in f ocus for the OLE 
study R668-AD-1434 with  a new data cut-off of 10-Mar-2022.  The results of these analyses were 
consistent with  prior analyses. 
Exposure-Response 
Positive concentration-response relationships were observed between higher dupilumab C trough at week 16 
and increases in the proportion of patients  achieving IGA (0,1),  increases in the proportion of patients 
with  EASI-75 which  both were key efficacy endpoints study R668-AD-1539  Part B, and this  was consistent 
across all age groups within  the dupilumab AD program. Positive exposure-response relationships were 
moreover observed for improvement in EASI percent change from baseline and improvement in weekly 
average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS change from baseline. 
Due the  sparsity of patients with  dupilumab Ctrough at week 16 <50  mg/L, the characterization of the  full 
E-R relationship is limited.  
No positive relationship between dupilumab  C trough at week 16 and the probability of developing 
conjunctivitis (broad or narrow CMQ terms) was observed, suggesting that  higher exposures to 
dupilumab were not  associated with  a greater risk of developing conjunctivitis.

2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH provided a comprehensive package on clinical pharmacology to support the dosing regimen in 
children ≥6 months  to <6 years of age with  severe AD. The proposed posology in this patient  group is 
tiered by body weight with  patients ≥5 to <15  kg receiving 200  mg Q4W and with  patients ≥15 to <30 kg 
receiving 300 mg Q4W. No  loading dose is intended in the age group. This posology is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
No relationship with  respect to safety (probability of developing conjunctivitis  (broad or  narrow CMQ 
terms) can be found. Due the sparsity of patients with  lower (<50 mg/L)  dupilumab C trough at week 16, 
the characterization of the full  E-R relationships with  regard to safety and efficacy is limited  (see sections 
2.5 Clinical efficacy and 2.6 Clinical Safety). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical data package includes 3 studies: Phase 3  S tudy R668-AD 1539-Part  B (completed), Phase 2 
Study R668-AD 1539-Part A (completed) and the open-label extension (OLE)  study R668-AD-1434 
(ongoing). The final CSR will  be submitted  by the MAH around Q4-2026.  Efficacy data supporting this 
application come from pivotal, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study R668-AD-1539 Part  B. Supportive 
data come from Part A and the OLE study (see Figure 23). 
For study R668-AD 1539-Part  B,  the CSR is based upon a database lock when all patients had 
completed the end of treatment  visit and is considered the  final CSR (16 September 202 1).   
For study R668-AD-1539  Part A, the CSR to support this  submission is based on a database lock date 
of when all patients completed Part A (09 September 2019).   
For the ongoing OLE study, R668-AD-1434,  a third-step analysis is based on a data cut-off date of 31 
July 2021 and focuses on the  population of children ≥6  months to <6 years of age with  AD studied  in the 
dupilumab program to support this  application.

Methods 
Study design 
Study R668-AD-1539 was a two-part, Phase2/3 study investigating the  PK, efficacy and safety of 
dupilumab in paediatric patients aged ≥6 months to <6  years with moderate-to-severe AD, see Figure 
below:

Part A was an open-label, single ascending dose, sequential cohort study investigating the PK, safety, and 
initial  assessment of efficacy of a single dose of SC dupilumab in pediatric patients with  severe AD and  
enrolled 40  patients. Efficacy was assessed as secondary objective. This study part included two age 
cohorts; age cohort 1 (20  patients ≥2 to <6  years old) and age cohort 2 (20 patients ≥6  months to <2 
years old) that subdivided in 2 dose cohorts (cohort A: 3 mg/kg bw or cohort B: 6 mg/kg bw). The 
treatment sequence was 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B. Safety reviews were interposed before dosing of the next cohort. 
The dose of Part B was determined based on results from Part A. The study design for Part A is displayed 
in Figure 24. 
Figure 24 Study Flow  Diagram – Part A 
Part B was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in which SC dupilumab 
was administered concomitantly with  low potency TCS for 16 weeks to pediatric patients 6 months  to <6 
years of age with  moderate-to- severe AD using a fixed dose regimen, tiered by body weight: 200  mg 
Q4W for patients ≥5 to  <15 kg, 300 mg Q4W for patients ≥15 to  <30 kg. The study population of 
patients with  moderate AD was capped at 40 patients.  Patient were randomized 1:1   and stratified  by 
baseline body weight (≥5-<15  kg and ≥15-<30  kg), baseline disease severity (IGA=3 and 4), and 
region/country (North  America, Europe, Japan, and China). The study design for Part B is displayed in

Treatments 
Investigational  product 
Dupilumab was administered subcutaneously throughout  Study R668-AD-1539,  alternating among 
the different quadrants of the  abdomen, upper thighs, and upper arms so that the  same site is not 
injected for 2 consecutive administrations. All study interventions were provided centrally by the sponsor.

•  Dupilumab 150 mg/mL PFS, 300  mg (2.0 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution)  or  
•  Matching  Placebo (same formulation without  protein) 
•  Dose regimens: For patients  ≥5 to <15  kg: 200  mg (1.14 mL)  Q4W, for patients  ≥15 to <30  kg: 
300 mg (2.0  mL) Q4W 
Concomitant Therapy 
Background treatment was administered only in Part B. A ll patients  applied moisturizers (emollients) at

R668-AD-1539  Part A 
Sample size 
Overall 160 patients  were planned to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio allocation to dupilumab versus 
placebo. The sample size was powered for the  co -primary endpoints rate of patients with  IGA score of 0 
to 1 at week 16 and rate of patients  with an EASI -75 at week 16 tested with  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test. 
Assuming 2-sided 5% significance level, the  study can fulfil  the following power considerations, based on 
Fisher’s exact test: 
• 88% power to detect a difference of 21.4% between the dupilumab and placebo groups in the 
percentage of patients who achieve an IGA score of 0 to 1 at week 16, assumi ng 32.8% and 11.4%  for 
the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
• 99% power to detect a difference of 42.9% in the  percentage of patients  who achieve an EASI -75 
response at week 16,  assuming 69.7%  and 26.8% for the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. 
The assumptions used for the above power calculations were based on results from patients in  the R668 -
AD-1652 study (phase 3 combination study for patients  ≥6 to <12  years of age with severe AD). The 
tiered fixed-dose regimen (200 mg Q4W in  patients ≥5-<15  kg, 300 mg Q4W in patients ≥15-<30  kg) is 
expected to provide exposure comparable to that  seen with  300 mg Q4W in patients  ≥6 to <12  years of 
age or 300 mg Q2W in  adult patients. Further  justification for the sample size comes from the  results 
from the  R668-AD-1224 study (a phase 3 combination  [with TCS] study for adult patients with  moderate -
to-severe AD). In this  study, the proportions of patients  who achieved an IGA score of 0 to 1  at week 16 
were 38.7%  and 12.4% for dupilumab and placebo, respectively. The proportions of patients who 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 70/183 
 
 
 
 
 
achieved an EASI-75 response at week 16  were 23.3%  and 68.9% for dupilumab and placebo, 
respectively. 
The study will have a power of 96%  on both the co -primary endpoints based on the results from the 
R668-AD-1224 study.  Additional support for the sample size comes from the R668-AD-1526 study (a 
phase 3  study for adolescent patients  with  moderate -to-severe AD). 
Randomisation 
R668-AD-1539  Part B 
Patients were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio s tratified by baseline body weight (≥5-<15  kg and 
≥15-<30  kg), baseline disease severity (IGA=3 and 4),  and region/country (North  America, Europe, 
Japan, and China). The number of patients with  moderate AD (IGA=3) was planned to be capped at 
approximately 40. Approximately 160 patients were planned to be randomized to 1 of the following 2 
treatment regimens: 
• Dupilumab every 4 weeks (Q4W; a weight-tiered regimen): 
− For patients  with baseline weight ≥5 to  <15 kg: 200 mg Q4W 
− For patients  with baseline weight ≥15  to <30 kg: 300 mg Q4W 
• Placebo Q4W: matching  placebo based on baseline weight  category  
Figure 26 shows the randomization scheme for part B of the study. 
Figure 26 Randomisation Scheme (Part B) 
Randomization was planned to be conducted according to a central randomization scheme provided by an 
IWRS (Interactive Web Response system) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). 
Blinding (masking) 
R668-AD-1539  Part B 
Part B of the study was to be blinded to all individuals until  the prespecified unmasking to  conduct the 
primary analyses, except for IDMC members and for emergency unblinding. Blinded study drug  kits coded 
with  a medication numbering system were used. In order to maintain the blind,  lists linking these codes 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023

with  product lot numbers were not accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  Anti -drug antibody 
and drug concentration results should not  be communicated to the sites, and the  sponsor’s operational 
team should not have access to results associated with  patient  identification until  after the final database 
lock. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses were based on the 
treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). All efficacy variables were evaluated in  the FAS, 
which was the primary analysis set. 
The safety analysis set (SAF) was defined as all randomized patients who  received at least one dose of 
study drug and were analyzed as treated. Patients were considered as treated with  dupilumab if ≥ 1  dose 
of dupilumab was administered regardless of the  a llocated treatment. In addition,  nonrandomized but 
treated patients were defined not to  be part of the safety population  (SAF); however, their safety data 
were presented separately. Randomized patients for whom it was unclear whether they took the study 
drug were defined to be included in the safety population  as randomized. Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables were summarized based on the SAF.  
Additionally a PK analysis set (FAS with  ≥ 1 dose of IMP and ≥ 1 PK measurement), an ADA analysis set 
(AAS; all patients with  ADA measurements; analysed as treated) and a NAb analysis set (NAS; all 
patients with  NAb measurements; analysed as treated) were defined. 
Primary Estimands 
Primary Analysis 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)  test  adjusted by randomization strata (baseline weight  group: ≥5 -
<15 kg and ≥15-<30  kg), baseline disease severity (IGA=3 and 4),  and region/country (North  America, 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 72/183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Europe)) was to be used for the analysis of percentage of  patients  with  IGA 0 or 1  at week 16. Similar 
procedures were to be used for percentage of patients with  EASI -75 at week 16. 
Handling  of missing data 
For the co-primary endpoints missing values due to withdrawn  consent, AE and lack of efficacy were 
planned to be imputed as non-responder. Missing values due to any other reason including  COVID -19 
were planned to be imputed using multiple  imputation  (MI). All non-missing data were used for MI  and 
are planned to be imputed using regression method for a monotone  pattern and adjustment for 
covariates including treatment groups, randomization strata (baseline weight  group, baseline IGA  
and region), and relevant baseline variables. The missing values are planned to  be imputed  40 times. The 
corresponding results are planned to be combined by Rubin`s formula.  
Supplementary Analyses for Primary Endpoints 
Sensitivity analyses on co-primary efficacy endpoints were to be performed using a tipping -point 
analyses. To assess the robustness of primary analysis results, a delta-adjusting pattern-mixture 
approach for tipping point  analysis (2013,  Ratitch) under MNAR (missing not  at random) assumption, was 
conducted for the  co-primary endpoints.  
Secondary Estimands 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 73/183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Analysis  
The secondary binary efficacy endpoints were to be analysed using the same approaches used for the 
analysis of the primary endpoints described above (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)  test adjusted by 
randomization strata). 
The continuous endpoints (e.g. EASI, worst scratch/itch  NRS score) were to  be analysed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with  treatment, randomization strata (baseline weight  group: ≥5 -<15  kg 
and ≥15-<30  kg), baseline disease severity (IGA=3 and 4),  region/country (North  America, Europe)) and 
relevant baseline value included in the model as the primary analysis method.  
Handling  of missing data 
For the (key-) secondary endpoints missing values due to withdrawn  consent, AE and LOE were planned 
to be imputed by post-baseline WOCF  (worst observation carried forward). There by the missing data was 
imputed by post-baseline WOCF  if there was at least one non-missing post-baseline value or by baseline 
value if there was no post-baseline value.  
Missing values due to  any other reason including COVID -19 was planned to be imputed using multiple 
imputation  (MI) comparable to the methods described above for efficacy endpoints.  
Multiplicity   
A hierarchical procedure was used to control the overall Type -1 error rate at 0.05  (2-sided). The 
hierarchical testing  order is shown in below table (all comparisons are with the  placebo). Both co -primary 
endpoints needed to  have a significant  result before secondary endpoints could be tested.

Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses of the primary/co-primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in  the moderate-to-
severe population (FAS) were to be performed by sex, race, age of onset of AD, family history of atopic 
disease, baseline body weight group, baseline BMI group, region, AD severity by baseline IGA score, AD 
severity by baseline EASI score, baseline worst scratch/itch  NRS score, BSA involvement in AD at 
baseline, previous use of systemic immunosuppressants, history of asthma, history of allergic rhinitis, and 
history of food allergies.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
There were no unblinding  events during Part B of the study. 
In Part B, 12/83  (14.5%)  subjects of the DUP+TCS group and 8/79  (10.1%)  of the  PBO+TCS group had 
at least one major protocol deviation, overall more patients  assigned to the PBO+TCS gro up had one 
(97.5%  vs. 94.0%),  see Table  20. In both  groups, the  most common important protocol deviation was 
receiving an excluded concomitant medication (5/79,  6.3% in the PBO+TCS group vs. (6/83, 7.2%  in the 
DUP+TCS group).

The proportion of patients  in the FAS achieving EASI -75 (≥75% improvement from baseline) at week 16 
was higher in the dupilumab + TCS group (44/83;  53.0%)  than in  the placebo + TCS group (8/79;

Rescue treatment use had minimal impact on the study results. In sensitivity analysis using all observed 
values regardless of rescue treatment  use , with  patients  with missing values (those that  dropped out 
early from the  study) counted as non-responders (Table 34) and in LOCF sensitivity analysis with  values 
after first rescue treatment use set to missing and then using LOCF method to  impute the missing data 
(Table 35), the results were consistent with  the primary analysis and showed the proportion of patients 
achieving EASI-75 (≥75%  improvement from baseline) at week 16 was higher in the dupilumab +  TCS

from baseline to week 16 in  EASI score was greater in the dupilumab + TCS (−70.0%)  group than in the 
placebo + TCS group (−19.6%).  The LS mean difference in the percent change from baseline to week 16 
in EASI score was statistically significant  between the dupilumab + TCS group and the placebo + TCS 
group (p<0.0001).

Percent Change  from Baseline  to Week  16 in Weekly  Average  of Worst Scratch/Itch NRS Score 
from Baseline  to Week  16 
The mean weekly average of the daily worst scratch/itch NRS score at baseline was similar in both 
treatment groups (Table 41).  The LS mean percent change (reduction indicates improvement) from 
baseline to week 16 in the weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score was greater in the 
DUP+TCS (−49.4%)  group than in  the PBO+TCS group  (−2.2%). The LS mean difference in the percent 
change from baseline to week 16 in the weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score was 
statistically significant  (p<0.0001). 
Table 41  Primary Analysis of Percent Change from Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Scratch/Itch 
NRS Score at Week 16 in Study R668-AD-1539  – Part B (FAS) 
A greater LS mean percent change from baseline in weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score 
was observed in the  DUP+TCS group by as early as week 1 (nominal p=0.0039  at week 1). The  
treatment group difference was sustained throughout the  remainder of the 16 -week treatment period 
(nominal p<0.0001  at all subsequent measurements through week 16).

In sensitivity analysis using all observed values regardless of rescue treatme nt use (Table 42) and in 
LOCF sensitivity analysis with  values after first rescue treatment use set to missing and then using LOCF 
method to impute the  missing data (Table 43), the results showed the LS mean percent change 
(reduction indicates improvement) from baseline to week 16  in the weekly average of daily worst 
scratch/itch NRS score was greater in the dupilumab  + T CS group than in the  placebo + TCS group.

A descriptive analysis of efficacy results for the primary and key secondary endpoints in patients ≥6

Efficacy data relevant for dose recommendation 
For children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age weighing ≥5 to  <15 kg the proposed dose regimen is 200  mg 
Q4W and for children weighing  ≥15 to <30  kg the proposed dose regimen is 300 mg Q4W.  The efficacy 
data from the  pivotal, phase 3 study (R668-AD-1539  Part B) show that  weight-tiered dupilumab 200/300 
mg Q4W resulted in statistically significant  improvements in signs, symptoms, and QOL in children ≥6 
months to <6  years of age with moderate-to-severe AD, including in  the subgroup of severe AD patients.

Patients in the  placebo + TCS arm were more likely to require rescue therapies; sensitivity analyses 
demonstrate nominally significant  efficacy with dupilumab over placebo control when considering all 
observed values regardless of rescue treatment use, as well as LOCF  sensitivity analysis with values after 
first rescue treatment use set to missing and then using LOCF  method to impute the missing data. 
Consistency of the dupilumab +  TCS treatment effect was observed among all the subgroups with  the 
proposed dose regimen. Furthermore, the efficacy data in  children ≥6  months to <6 years of age were 
generally consistent with  efficacy data for children ≥6 to <12  years of age, adolescents, and adults.  
A rapid onset of effect was seen for outcome measures eva luating pruritus as well as signs of AD 
providing validation that  a loading dose was not needed in this  age group. For percent change from 
baseline to week 16 in weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score and EASI score, a nominally 
statistically significant  difference between the  dupilumab 200/300  mg Q4W and placebo arm was seen as 
early as week 2. A similar rapid improvement was seen in the proportion of patients with  improvement 
(reduction) of weekly average of daily worst  scratch/itch NRS scor e ≥4 from baseline, with  a nominally 
statistically significant  difference between the  dupilumab 200/300  mg Q4W and the  placebo groups seen 
as early as week 3.  Positive concentration-response relationships were observed, with higher dupilumab 
Ctrough at week 16 leading to increases in the proportion of patients  achieving IGA 0/1,  increases in the 
proportion of patients  with  EASI-75, improvement in  EASI percent change from baseline, and 
improvement in weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS percent  change from baseline for children 
≥6 months  to <6 years of age in the pivotal study. Efficacy data in  patients with  severe AD in the pivotal 
phase 3  study (R668-AD-1539 Part B) show a consistent  pattern of nominally significant improvements in 
signs, symptoms, and QOL with  a weight-tiered dupilumab 200/300  mg Q4W regimen. 
Overall, clinical efficacy data support the proposed posology in patients ≥6  months to <6  years of age 
with  AD: for patients with  body weight  ≥5 to <15  kg the proposed dose regimen is 200  mg Q4W and for 
patients with  body weight ≥15  to <30 kg the proposed dose regimen is 300 mg Q4W, both  administered 
without  a loading dose.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant provided a comparison of efficacy data across the studies included in the  AD clinical 
development program. Results are presented in Table 51 (Baseline Disease Characteristics), Table 52 
(Co-primary and Key secondary endpoints) and Table 53 (Sensitivity analyses). As outlined  by the 
applicant, there are differences in study designs that need to be taken into  consideration:  
• R668-AD-1652  – children ≥6 to <12 years – enrolled patients with  severe AD only, whereas R668-
AD-1539 Part B enrolled patients with  moderate-to-severe AD. Additionally in R668-AD-1652,  dupilumab 
was administered in combination with  medium potency TCS, while in R668-AD-1539  Part B dupilumab 
was administered in combination with  low-potency TCS. 
• R668-AD-1526  – adolescents – dupilumab was administered as monotherapy, whereas in R668-AD-
1539  Part B dupilumab was administered in combination with  low-potency TCS. 
• Pooled SOLO  – adults – dupilumab was administered as monotherapy in the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 
studies, whereas in R668-AD-1539  Part B dupilumab was administered in combination with  low-potency 
TCS. Although there were additional adult studies where dupilumab was evaluated in combination with 
medium-potency TCS (eg, R668-AD-1224), the  SOLO studies were thought  to provide a better basis for  
comparison as the monotherapy setting  is closer to low-potency TCS used in R668-AD-1539 Part B than 
studies in combination with  medium-potency TCS.

In studies in children ≥6 to <12  years, adolescents, and adults a loading dose of dupilumab was 
administered on day 1, whereas in R668-AD-1539  Part B no loading dose was used, in order to limit  the 
number of injections in this  younger population. Furthermore, assessment of pruritus was reporte d by 
caregivers in children ≥6 months  to <6 years and reported by patients in the other age groups.  
The following approved dosing regimens, which have been shown to provide comparable trough 
concentrations of dupilumab at steady-state, were used as the basis for comparisons of efficacy data 
across the dupilumab program: 
• R668-AD-1652  – children ≥6  to <12 years – dupilumab 300  mg Q4W 
• R668-AD-1526  – adolescents – dupilumab 200/300  mg Q2W 
• Pooled SOLO – adults – dupilumab 300  mg Q2W

Supportive studies 
R668-AD-1539  Part A 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the safety analysis set (SAF), which included all patients who 
received any study drug. Overall, 39/40  patients completed the study and were included in the final 
analysis of R668-AD-1539 Part A. A trend towards numerically higher effect was seen with  the 6 mg/kg 
dose as compared to 3 mg/kg dose, especially at week 4,  see Table 54. See also pharmacological section.

data from children who rolled over from R668-AD-1539  Part A and R668-AD-1539 Part B. A summary of 
the results is displayed in Table 55. 
Numbers analysed 
At the time of the third-step  analysis, of the 180 children ≥6  months to <6 years of age enrolled in  the 
study, 122  patients had completed at least 16 weeks in the OLE, 68 patients  had completed at least 26 
weeks, 30 patients  had completed at least 52 weeks, and 29  patients had completed at  least 104  weeks 
of treatment period.

Study design 
Study R668-AD-1434 is a phase 3,  ongoing OLE  study investigating the long-term safety, efficacy, PK, 
and immunogenicity of repeat monthly SC doses of dupilumab  in pediatric patients  with  AD who had  
previously completed a clinical study with  dupilumab in patients with  AD.  
The study consisted of a screening period (day -28 to  day -1), a treatment period of up 5 years for 
patients ≥6  months to <6 years of age, and a 12-week follow-up period.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the OLE study was to assess the long -term safety of dupilumab in pediatric 
patients with  AD. Long-term efficacy was evaluated as a secondary objective.  
Outcomes 
Efficacy assessments included EASI, IGA of AD severity, SCORAD, BSA i nvolvement with AD, CDLQI, and 
IDQOL. 
Study participants 
The patient population consists of pediatric patients ≥6 months  to <18 years of age with  AD who 
participated in a prior clinical study of dupilumab in AD. The majority of these patients  entered the OLE 
from the  pivotal study (R668-AD-1539 Part B) and received a weight-tiered fixed-dose regimen of 
dupilumab.  
Study treatment 
Starting from R668-AD-1434 amendment 4, the dose regimen for children ≥6  months to <6 years old 
was changed from weight-based dosing (3 mg/kg QW or 6 mg/kg QW) to a fixed dose regimen, tiered by 
body weight  irrespective of age (5 kg to <15 kg: 200 mg Q4W,  15 kg to  <30 kg: 300 mg Q4W). The use 
of topical medication for AD (including  TCS and TCIs) was permitted  during the study. It wa s 
recommended that investigators should select the  potency based on the  age of the patient,  severity of 
disease and affected region, and that use be consistent with  local guidelines.   
The treatment duration of an individual patient in the  OLE study was determined by enrollment date 
(which varied across patients)  and the data cut-off date for the  study (which was the same across all 
patients, 31  Jul 2021).

Assessment of Efficacy Parameters Following Treatment Discontinuation 
As per protocol, dupilumab was discontinued in patients who achieved a sustained remission defined as 
achieving and maintaining  an IGA score of 0/1  for at least 12 consecutive weeks after 40  weeks of 
treatment. In patients  who had achieved sustained remission, AD disease activity was monitored after 
discontinuation  of dupilumab.  In case these patients  had a relapse of disease defined as IGA score ≥2,

dupilumab was re-initiated at the  same dose regimen they were receiving previously . Table 59 provides 
efficacy data following treatment discontinuation.  30/180  (16.7%)  patients completed week 52, 18/30 
(60%)  had a sustained remission and 14 of these re-initiated dupilumab treatment  after 12 weeks 
(median).

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application for extension of indication is supported by 3 clinical studies: the  pivotal completed phase 
3 study R668-AD 1539-Part B, and two supportive studies R668-AD 1539-Part A (completed Phase 2)  and 
R668-AD-1434 (ongoing open-label extension study, OLE).  The studies target patients aged ≥6  months 
to ≤6  years with moderate-to severe AD whose disease was not adequately controlled with  topical 
treatment (note:  In Part A only patients  with  severe AD were enrolled and in Part B, the  patient number 
with  moderate disease was capped at ~40).  The claimed indication is “Dupixent is indicated for the 
treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in  children 6 months  to 11 years old who are candidates for 
systemic therapy”.  
A paediatric investigation plan was submitted in  2013 and approved in 2014  followed by 7 modifications. 
A waiver was granted for the paediatric population from birth  to less than  6 months.   
The integral parts of the main study R668-AD-1539  were conducted sequentially.  
Part A was a phase 2, open-label, single ascending dose, sequential cohort study investigating the 
pharmacokinetics, safety, and initial  assessment of efficacy of a single dose of SC dupilumab (DUP) in 40

paediatric patients  with  severe AD. Part A was initiated to establish the  dose regimen for the subsequent 
pivotal study Part B; patients  were dosed with  dupilumab 3 mg or 6 mg per kg bodyweight.  All received 
concomitant low to  medium TCS/TCI. The study design included 2 age cohorts: Cohor t 1 (≥2  to <6 
years) and cohort 2 (≥6 months to  <2 years) which were subdivided in 2 dose cohorts, i.e. sub -cohort A 
(3 mg/kg) and sub-cohort B (6  mg/kg). 
Part B  was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled, pivotal study in paediatric 
patients ≥6  months to <6 years of age with  moderate -to-severe AD whose disease was not adequately 
controlled with  topical medication investigating  the efficacy of 200/300  mg dupilumab Q4W in 
combination with  low potency TCS after 16 weeks of treatment. Pa tients were randomised in a 1:1  ration 
to the 200/300  mg Q4W+TCS or placebo+TCS treatment group.  
Patients who had completed the treatment period of study parts A and/or B were eligible for participation 
in the OLE  study R668-AD-1434,  i.e. at week 4  or 16.  The OLE study is investigating  the long-term 
safety, efficacy, PK, and immunogenicity of repeat monthly SC doses of dupilumab in  p aediatric patients 
with  AD aged ≥6 months to <18  years who had previously completed a clinical study with  dupilumab. 
Patients declining this  participation were followed-up for either 4  weeks (Part A) or 12 weeks (Part B).  
The overall design of Study R668-AD 1539 was conducted in accordance with the  agreed PIP and 
considered adequate by the CHMP.  The selected study population in Part A is relevant for the  applied 
indication. The study population in  Part B comprises patients with  moderate or severe AD, whereas the 
claimed indication  is restricted to  severe AD. At the  CHMP request, further analyses were conducted by 
the MAH  and discussed below. 
The co-primary endpoint of the pivotal Study Part B was the Proportion of patients with  IGA 0 or 1 at 
week 16 and the  Proportion of patients with  EASI -75 at  week 16. The key secondary endpoints were the 
Percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 16  and the Percent change from baseline to  week 16 
in weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score. Efficacy assessments included the analyses of 
IGA, EASI, daily worst scratch/itch NRS score, and BSA involvement with AD. As to the  primary endpoints 
both the  IGA and EASI scales are established outcome measures and correlation with  disease severity 
and activity. The worst itch (WI-)NRS scale as patient-reported outcome is a valid and fit-for-purpose tool 
to measure itch  severity, thus, this is an accepted key secondary efficacy endpoint. The co -primary and 
key secondary endpoints, including standard efficacy variables like the EASI -75 and IGA 0 or 1 which 
represent a sufficient degree of improvement, are considered adequate and in line  with  the objectives of 
this study.  The chosen study objectives and endpoints are considered relevant to support the  claimed 
indication. Topical treatment with  TCS and moisturizers was standardised before randomisation. The 
choice of the background treatment  is reasonable to address the  considerable disease burden of patients, 
especially of those assigned to the PBO arm. As these young patients might  experience a greater toxicity 
from percutaneous absorption of TCS with higher potency due to their increased surface to volume ratio 
and/or metabolic differences the use of low-potency TCS is endorsed.  
In Part A, the primary endpoints  were the concentration of functional dupilumab in serum over time and 
PK parameters and the incidence and severity of TEAEs to week 4.  The secondary endpoints were related 
to safety, efficacy and immunogenicity.  
Overall, 197 patients  were eligible, 162 thereof were randomised in both  treatment groups (n=83 in  the 
DUP+TCS group, n=79  in the PBO+TCS group). The compliance with  the study treatments was excellent 
in both  treatment groups. The proportions of patients  completing Week 16 were 83/83 (100%)  the 
DUP+TCS group and 76/79  (96.2%) in  the PBO+TCS group. 
The sample sizes are considered acceptable and are in line with  PDCO requirements. R668 -AD-1539  Part 
B was adequately powered for the primary efficacy analysis for the indication  mode rate-to-severe AD. 
Overall, the study R668-AD-1539  Part B was not planned to assess the efficacy of dupilumap in patients

with  severe AD. The analyses in the severe population were not  included in the hierarchical testing 
strategy (but 16 endpoints  were controlled for multiplicity  in the FAS) and there is no type 1  error control 
for the tests on the severe population which leads to  uncertainty of the  results from a statistical point  of 
view. The MAH  was requested to provide additional evidence of biological  plausibility and reproducibility 
of the observed effects and to provide a comparison of efficacy data in patients  with  severe AD in 
different age groups (<6, 6-12,  adolescents and adults) and discuss them, giving explanation to  possible 
differences. From a statistical perspective, in general, to  support a new indication  the efficacy analysis 
should have the relevant population as the  primary population in the statistical  analysis plan and 
therefore assessed with type 1 error control, especially in such a f easible population. From a clinical 
perspective however, the totality  of evidence from the clinical program is considered adequate to support 
the nominally statistically significant  difference between the dupilumab  and placebo arms reported for the 
severe AD population. In addition, the moderate-to-severe multiplicity-controlled endpoints, at  time of 
final analysis, was made up of 75%  of patients  (125/162)  with  severe disease at baseline thus  the 
efficacy results in the overall population was represented in majority by the severe patients. In addition, 
the current approved indication for patients 6 years -11 years old in the EU  is ‘severe AD’, maintaining 
continuity  across paediatric age groups which is endorsed by the CHMP  at this time point. 
Demographic factors ‘age group’ and ‘weight’  are considered unbalanced as the minority of study 
participants was ≥6 months  to <2 years old. A minority of study participants was ≥6 months  to <2 years 
old, i.e. 5/11 (6.3%)  in the PBO + TCS group and 6/11 (7.2%)  in the DUP+TCS group, and the  majority 
≥2 years and <6 years (74/79,  93.7% in  the PCO+TCS group and 77/83,  92.8%  in the DUP+TCS group) 
resulting in a mean age of 3.9 years in both treatment  groups. As to the weight  groups: at  baseline, 
51/162  (31.5%)  weighed ≥5  to <15 kg and 111/162  (68.5%)  ≥15 to <30  kg group. Other demographic 
factors were relatively consistent in the overall study population.  As requested, the  MAH discussed the 
imbalances based on subgroup analyses and literature review (see below).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In part B, the proportion of patients  achieving IGA scores of 0 or 1 (23/83, 27.7%  vs. 3/79,  3.9%, 
p<0.0001)  and EASI-75 (44/83, 53.0%  vs. 8/79, 10.7%,  p<0.0001)  at Week 16  was numerically higher 
in the DUP+TCS group compared with  the PBO+TCS group. In patients with  severe AD (IGA 4 at 
baseline), who  achieved IGA scores of 0 or 1 at Week 16,  the proportion was also larger in the verum 
group, (9/63,  14.3% vs. 1/62. 1.7%),  and the proportion of patients  achieving EASI -75 at Week 16 wad 
larger in the DUP+TCS group compared with the PBO+TCS group (29/63,  46.0%  vs. 4/62,  7.8%) . The 
comparison of the efficacy results in the overall vs. the  severe subgroup population show ed that the  more 
favourable results related to IGA 0/1  and EASI-90 at week 16  were driven by the treatment response of 
the patients  with moderate disease at  Baseline. The results of the requested sensitivity analyses for the 
co-primary endpoints in the severe population however support the results of the primary  analyses. 
Sensitivity analyses for the key secondary endpoints partly showed differences in the effect size but 
supported the direction of the effect. 
The remaining results were comparable in both  subgroups suggesting a consistent treatment  effect in the 
target population. Results from the OLE study confirm ed a beneficial effect as increasing patient numbers 
achieved IGA 0/1 and EASI-90 over time. The results of the Co-primary endpoints are statistically 
significant and considered clinically relevant and thus, superiority of dupilumab  over placebo is 
demonstrated in patients with  (moderate-to-) severe AD. 
Results of the key secondary endpoints substantiate  the efficacy of dupilumab in the investigated 
population of patients with  moderate-to-severe AD as shown by decline of EASI score which  was 
considerably more pronounced in the  DUP+TCS group (-70; mean %Change -63.1  vs. -19.6; mean 
%change -11.4) with  a statistically significant  LS mean difference in the percent change from baseline to 
Assessment report

Page 128/183 
 
 
 
 
week 16 between both  treatment groups at Week 16 i.e., -50.4  (-62.38,  -38.40).  This is interpreted as 
clinically relevant treatment effect. Another key secondary endpoint was the Percent Change from 
Baseline to Week 16  in Weekly Average of Worst Scratch/Itch NRS Score from Baseline to Week 16. 
Decreases in daily worst scratch/itch NRS score were more significant  in the verum group (−49.4%  vs. 
−2.2%,  LS mean difference -47.1)  and considered clinically meaningful. Similar results were observed as 
to the improvement of weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score ≥4 or ≥3 from Baseline at 
Week 16 (≥4  points: 48.1%  vs. 8.9%,  p<0.0001;  ≥3 points:  53.3% vs. 9.9%,  p<0.0001).  As pruritus is 
a cardinal symptom of AD with  a high  impact on life quality,  these results substantiate  the clinical benefit 
of dupilumab in the target population.  The results of the key secondary endpoints in the subpopulation 
with  severe AD were significant and are considered clinically relevant. These results have been added in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The analysis of further EASI endpoints, i.e. the proportion of patients  in the FAS achieving EASI -50 and -
90, or endpoints assessing AD severity as Change from baseline to week 16 in SCORAD/Percent BSA 
affected by AD, showed that  treatment with  dupilumab combined with  TCS improved AD symptoms far 
more effectively than placebo and TCS. This is also reflected by results regarding observer - or patient-
reported assessments related to treatment effects on sleep quality, skin pain, POEM and others.    
The subgroup analyses performed for the  most relevant endpoints confirm the superiority of dupilumab 
over placebo in both  weight groups and genders. Regarding both weight  subgroups, results differ 
minimally among each other and compared with  the overall results, e.g. the proportion of patients with 
IGA score 0/1 and EASI-75 at week 16  was higher in patients  weighing ≥5 to <15  kg (38.5% vs. 22.8% 
and 57.7% vs. 50.9%)  probably due to a higher exposure. Principally, the  results are consistent with 
those of the overall study population.  
As to the age, a trend towards higher clinical benefit caused by dupilumab treatment is observed in the 
younger patients  in the pivotal and the open-label extension study.  
The effect of treatment discontinuation  on efficacy was analysed in  30 patients who had rolled over from 
study R668-AD-1539 into  Study R668-AD-1434 and who had completed week 52. The majority of 
patients (14/18,  77.8%)  re-initiated dupilumab treatment  due to  relapse (IGA score ≥2) after an initial 
sustained remission defined as achieving and maintaining  an IGA score of 0/1 for at least 12  consecutive 
weeks after 40 weeks of treatment. Overall, the data are too  limited to draw any  robust conclusions; 
however, results from the  older patient population  were similar suggesting the need for continuous 
treatment with  dupilumab. 
Efficacy results were compared across the paediatric and adult population. Study  R668-AD-1652  had 
enrolled children ≥6 to  <12 years with  severe AD who received dupilumab in combination with  medium 
potency TCS. Study R668-AD-1526 enrolled an adolescent population with  moderate -to-severe AD where 
dupilumab was administered as monotherapy. Pooled SOLO studies investi gated the efficacy of dupilumab 
monotherapy in adults.  Thus, the data allow an orienting evaluation of cross -study efficacy results. The 
FAS analysis sets were of similar sizes in the paediatric populations; within  the adolescent and adult 
population the ratio of patients with  moderate or severe disease was more balanced than  in the youngest 
study population. At baseline, mean EASI, worst scratch/itch NRS score, SCORAD and BSA involvement 
were balanced across all studies,  IGA scores varied dependent of dise ase severity. Considering the 
variations in  study designs, the systematic comparison of all relevant efficacy parameters provides 
evidence that dupilumab  provides clinical benefit to  a similar extent also in  the age group ≥6 months to 
≤6 years. 
In Part A, only one single dose was administered, results should be construed as supplementary 
information, however, indicate some clinical benefit after Week 3.

In OLE study R668-AD-1434,  overall 180 patients ≥6 months  to <6 years of age were enrolled, 30 of 
these received dupilumab until  week 52  and 27  until  week 104. The majority applied concomitantly TCS 
with  variable potency (146/180,  81%). 
Patients enrolled in  parent study R668-AD-1539  Part A had a measurable therapeutic benefit throughout 
the open-label extension study R668-AD-1434.  Results of the primary and (key) secondary endpoints 
show steady improvement of AD related symptoms that are considered clinically meaningful even in the 
uncontrolled setting.  At the CHMP request, the MAH  performed additional efficacy analyses based on an 
updated data cut off of OLE study R688-AD-1434 (10-Mar-2022).  There was a consistent  trend towards 
incremental efficacy consistently across all endpoints between week 16  and week 52. This was displayed 
with  updated data in the FAS, across the two  age and weight sub-groups. Key efficacy outcomes by 
previous treatment (placebo/dupilumab) were also reported with  an updated data cut off, again 
consistent with  efficacy trends. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The co-primary endpoints were met and considered statically and clinically relevant. The superiority of 
dupilumab+TCS over placebo+TCS in the indication “Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of severe 
atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 11  years old who are candidates for systemic therapy” was 
demonstrated for the target population  (severe AD).  
The final results of the OLE  study R668-AD-1434 will be submitted  by the  MAH to provide additional  long 
term efficacy data. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation plan comprises different safety analysis sets. The safety analysis set (SAF) for the 
individual studies described in the clinical summary included all patients who  received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. Patients were analyzed as they  were treated. For ADA analyses sets, see Immunogenicity 
section below. The safety data have not been pooled except for patient accountability  and exposure.

Adverse events 
The MAH provided adverse event analyses for all included patients  with  moderate -to-severe AD and a so-
called subgroup analysis for those patients who had severe AD at baseline. Safety results and the 
corresponding assessment of patients with  severe AD (claimed ind ication)  are presented together in the 
respective sections for pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B and OLE study R668-AD-1434 to provide a

enrollment. 
Overview of adverse events 
R668-AD-1539  Part B (moderate-to-severe  AD) 
An overview of adverse events is provided in Table 69. 
The proportion of patients  who had at  least 1 TEAE during the  16-week treatment  period was higher in 
the PBO + TCS group (58/78;  74.4%) than  in the DUP + TCS group (53/83;  63.9%).

A summary of TEAEs in patients  with severe AD is presented in Table 70. 45/61  (73.8%) in  the PBO+TCS 
group experiences any TEAE, slightly  more compared with the  DUP+TCS group 42/63 (66.7%).  Most 
TEAEs were mild-to-moderate in intensity and balanced between the  treatment groups. TESAEs were 
reported in the  PCO+TCS group in  3/61 (4.9%)  patients, none occurred in the verum group.

Period in Study R668-AD-1539  Part B (SAF) 
R668-AD-1539  Part A (severe  AD) 
In patients aged ≥2 years to <6 years, 5/20  patients (25.0%)  experienced a TEAE in the 4 -week 
treatment period, with  a similar incidence between the 2 dose groups: 3/10 (30%)  and 2/10  (20%)  in 
patients receiving the  3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg dupilumab dose, respectively. None of these events  
were severe in intensity or assessed by the investigator as being related to study drug. There was 1 
serious TEAE (Anaphylactic reaction) which  was unrelated to study drug. 
In patients aged ≥6 months to <2  years, 14/20 patients  (70.0%) experienced a TEAE (Table 71). The 
incidence was the same in the 2 dose groups (7/10  [70%]) indicating  no dose response relationship. One 
patient (5.0%)  had a TEAE that was severe in intensity (anaphylactic reaction), an d 2 patients  (10.0%) 
had events (1 event per patient) related to the study drug (PT: injection site erythema and PT: diarrhea). 
All but 3 events in 2 patients (PT: dermatitis atopic, PT: impetigo, and PT: thrombocytosis) were  transient 
and had resolved or were resolving at the  time of the data cutoff date. There was one serious TEAE (PT: 
anaphylactic reaction), which  was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to  study drug and for 
which a clear alternative cause was present.

and resolved over time. One patient  permanently discontinued the study  drug due to a TEAE (Urticaria). 
There were 2 (2/180;  1.1%) patients who  experienced an SAE during the   study (Anaphylactic reaction

Treatment Period in Study R668-AD-1539  Part B – SAF 
Part A (severe  AD) 
In patients aged ≥2 years to <6 years, no TEAEs of severe intensity were reported.  
In patients aged ≥6 months to <2  years, 1 severe TEAE (PT Anaphylactic reaction) was reported  in the 3 
mg/kg dose cohort. Anaphylactic reaction was defined as an AESI, see assessment below. 
Study R668-AD-1434  (moderate-to-severe  AD) 
In the OLE study R668-AD-1434,  3 patients (3/180;  1.7%)  had TEAEs that  were classified as severe: 
Blepharitis (1 event), Anaphylactic reaction (1 event), and Urticaria (1  event). All events resolved under 
supportive treatment. 
Treatment-Emergent Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
R668-AD-1539  Part B (moderate-to-severe  AD)  
The proportion of patients  who had at  least 1 treatment-related TEAE was higher in the dupilumab + TCS

R668-AD-1539  Part A (severe  AD) 
In patients aged ≥6 months to <2  years, in the 6 mg/kg dose cohort, there were 2 patients with  TEAEs 
considered to be related to the  study drug: 1 patient with  Diarrhea, and 1 patient with  Injection site 
erythema. Both events were mild in intensity  and resolved. 
R668-AD-1434  (moderate-to-severe  AD) 
In the OLE study R668-AD-1434,  a total  of 15 (15/180;  8.3%)  patients experienced a TEAE considered by 
the investigator to be related to study  drug. The most common related TEAEs were: Conjunctivitis,  which 
was reported in 3 patients,  and Blepharitis, Conjunctivitis  allergic, and Urticaria, which were each 
reported in 2  patients. All other TEAEs considered to be related to study drug occurred in no more than 1 
patient each.

Four patients  (4/78; 5.1%)  reported SAEs during the  16-week treatment  period in the PBO + TCS group; 
there were no SAEs in the  dupilumab + TCS group (Table 80).  In the  placebo + TCS group, 1 patient 
had 1 SAE of Dermatitis atopic and 1 SAE of Dermatitis infected, 1 patient had an SAE of Hypersensitivity, 
1 patient  had an SAE of Staphylococcal bacteremia and 1 patient  had an SAE of Cellulitis staphylococcal 
(Table 80). None of the  SAEs were considered related to study medication and none led to study drug 
discontinuation.

No SAEs were reported in the DUP + TCS group. 3/61 patients (4.9%)  with  severe AD at baseline 
reported 4 SAEs during the 16-week treatment period in the  PBO + TCS group.  
R668-AD-1539  Part A (severe  AD) 
In patients aged ≥2 years to <6 years, an SAE of Anaphylactic reaction of moderate intensity was 
reported in 1  patient in the 3 mg/kg cohort. 
In patients aged ≥6 months to <2  years, an SAE of Anaphylactic reaction of severe intensity was  
reported in 1  patient in the 3 mg/kg cohort. Both of the SAEs were defi ned as an AESI. 
R668-AD-1434  (moderate-to-severe  AD) 
In study R668-AD-1434, 2 patients  (2/180;  1.1%) experienced an SAE (Anaphylactic reaction and 
Pneumonia mycoplasmal). Neither  of the  reported SAEs lead to permanent treatment  discontinuation and 
neither were considered to be related to dupilumab. Both SAEs resolved over time with  treatment.  
R668-AD-1434  (severe AD) 
No SAEs were reported in patients  with severe AD.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The following AEs were pre-defined as AESIs in the protocol: 
• Anaphylactic reactions 
• Systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
• Helminthic  infections 
• Any type of conjunctivitis or blepharitis (severe or serious) 
• Keratitis 
• Clinically symptomatic eosinophilia 
R668-AD-1539  Part B (moderate-to-severe  AD) 
One patient reported 1 AESI of non-serious, severe, bilateral, ulcerating blepharitis (DUP+PBO group) 20 
days after the third dose of study drug that was considered related to  study treatment. The AESI 
improved under supportive treatment and the study  drug was continued until  the end of the study.  
No AESIs were reported in the follow-up period.

16-Week  Treatment Period -  Part B (SAF) 
Conjunctivitis 
The proportion of patients  with at least 1 conjunctivitis -related event during the 16-week treatment 
period was higher in the dupilumab +  TCS group using narrow (4.8%  vs. 0)  and broad (7.2% vs. 1.3%) 
customized MedDRA query (CMQ). 
Injection Site  Reactions 
Injection site reaction events were rarely reported, of mild intensity and frequencies were balanced 
across the treatment groups (DUP+ TCS 2.4%  vs. 2.6%  in the P BO +TCS).   
R668-AD-1539  Part A (severe  AD) 
There were 2 patients with  an AESI of serious anaphylactic food reaction, both  unrelated to the study 
drug.

R668-AD-1434  (moderate-to-severe  AD) 
3 AESIs were reported in 3 patients (1.7%).  A serious, severe Anaphylactic reaction of food allergy that 
was considered unrelated to  dupilumab, one dupilumab-related severe blepharitis and subsequent 
blepharoconjunctivitis (ongoing AESI of patient 840525501,  see above), and an unrelated moderate 
keratitis. None of the AESIs led to discontinuation  of dupilumab. All events resolved over time with 
treatment.

Events of Special Interest Category and Preferred Term - Children ≥6 to <12  Years of Age (SAF) 
Conjunctivitis 
Using the narrow search, 7.2%  of the patients  had a conjunctivitis  events in the  OLE study, using the 
conjunctivitis broad CMQ 8.9%. None of the events were serious or led to  treatment discontinuation.  Most 
of the events were reported as recovered/resolved during the study period after treatment.  
Injection Site  Reactions 
The incidence of Injection site reactions was very low during the OLE study (2.2%,   EAIR 3.05),  no severe 
or serious reaction was observed. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The applicant’s review of all TEAEs did not identify any new ADRs in the population  of children with  AD 
aged ≥6  months to <6  years as compared to the older children (≥6  years to <12 years), adolescent, and 
adult AD patient populations who received dupilumab treatment. There were no TEAEs in  which the lower 
bound of the 95% confidence interval for the Cox hazard ratio in  dupilumab + TCS versus placebo +  TCS 
was greater than 1,  and a medical review did not identify any ADRs based on an evaluation of less -
frequent PTs.

In Table 83, all AEs leading to  permanent study drug discontinuation  are listed. Overall, 4 patients 
assigned to  the placebo group experienced SAEs, all of them were  considered unrelated and resolved 
during the course of the study.  Non-serious TEAE occurred in 2 patients  of either treatment group that 
resulted in permanent study drug discontinuation;  both mild  and moderate, respectively, and were also 
considered unrelated to the study drug.

Mean/Median  Changes from Baseline 
Red Blood Cells and  Platelets 
All studies 
During the treatment period of study R668-AD-1539  Part B, Part A and R668-AD-1434, there were no 
clinically meaningful trends or differences in mean or median changes from baseline for any red blood cell 
(RBC) parameter or platelets.

White  Blood Cells 
R668-AD-1539  Part B 
There were no clinically meaningful trends or differences between treatment groups in mean or median 
changes from baseline in most white  blood cell (WBC) parameters during the treatment period. Mean 
(SD) eosinophil counts at  baseline were similar across bo th treatment groups. There was an increase in 
eosinophil counts in the dupilumab + TCS group at week 4 and week 16 as  assessed by the mean 
change from baseline, with  the a peak at week 4 (see Figure 38). This increase was not seen in the 
median values indicating that  the mean change was driven by a small subset of patients ( Figure  39).

In study R668-AD-1539 Part A, there was a trend towards modest increases in mean eosinophil  counts 
from baseline to week 4.  
R668-AD-1434 
There was no meaningful change from baseline in WBC during the treatment period. See Figure 40 for 
changes in  mean eosinophil counts. The mean change from baseline wa s 0.32  (1.56) ×109/L  at  week 16 
and - 0.41 (0.71)  ×109/L  at week 52.  This pattern of an increase at week 16 was not seen with  median 
change from baseline, suggesting  it was driven by a few outlier patients.

R668-AD-Part  A 
In study R668-AD-1539 Part A, PCSVs were not defined. 1 patient  was however observed with  an 
unrelated non-serious AE of moderate thrombocytosis that  started on study day 1. Platelet counts were 
high throughout  the period: 390 ×109/L  at screening, 609 ×109/L  on day 1, 568  ×109/L  on day 10,  and 
481 ×109/L  on day 29 (normal range 213-363×109/L). 
R668-AD-1434 
Overall, 1 (2.4%)  patient had 1 treatment-emergent PCSV for RBCs and platelets at week 52 (baseline 
367 ×109/L,  week 52 744 ×109/L),  however, platelet counts had returned to  the normal range (197 to 
382 ×109/L)  at an unscheduled visit 165  days later (367 ×109/L)  and remained within  norma l range at 
week 104  (364 ×109/L).  Platelet counts were flagged as high at the  last laboratory assessment on study 
day 901  (334 ×109/L;  normal range 175-311  ×109/L).  No  TEAEs related to platelet counts were reported 
for the patient.  
White  Blood Cells 
R668-AD-Part  B 
As shown in Table 85, a greater proportion of patients in the dupilumab +  TCS group than the placebo + 
TCS group had treatment-emergent PCSVs for WBCs. This difference was mainly driven by the eosinophil 
PCSVs: 13 patients  in the dupilumab + TCS group had a treatment-emergent increase in eosinophil count 
that  was classified as a PCSV, compared with  9 patients (15.9%  vs. 11.7%)  in the  placebo + TCS group.  
Two patients (2/83;  2.4%)  in the dupilumab + TCS group had a TEAE of eosinophilia, 1 patient  (1/83; 
1.2%)  had a TEAE of neutropenia, and 1 patient  (1/83;  1.2%) had a TEAE of WBC increased. None of 
these events were serious and none led to discontinuation  o f study treatment. The TEAEs of eosinophilia 
were only laboratory abnormalities, were not associated with  any clinical symptoms, and did not results in 
study drug interruption or discontinuation.  The eosinophilia and WBC increased events had resolved by 
the end of treatment. The TEAE of neutropenia was not resolved by the  end of treatment. None of these 
events were associated with  clinical symptoms.

Period – White  Blood Cells – Part B (SAF) 
R668-AD-1434 
A total of 14/42  (33.3%) patients  had at least 1 treatment-emergent PCSV in  WBC parameters during the 
OLE. These were PCSVs for eosinophils (12/42  [28.6%])  and neutrophils  (2/42 [4.8%]).  The most 
common PCSV related to WBC parameters was for raised eosinophil count, which was reported in  12/42 
(28.6%)  patients. In 7/12  of these patients,  the raised counts reverted to be within  the normal reference 
range with  continued treatment.  Of the 5 patients with  a raised eosinophil count that  did not resolve, 3 
patients had eosinophils within  the normal range at baseline; 1 patient  had a value above normal range 
at baseline and all subsequent visits; and 1 had values above n ormal range at the first visit at which 
eosinophils were assessed (week 4), and at all except 1 of the subsequent visits. No TEAEs were reported 
for eosinophilia in any of these patients,  and these PCSVs did not  lead to treatment  discontinuation. Two 
patients had a PCSV for low neutrophils,  1 of which resolved over time and 1  of which  was flagged at the 
last laboratory assessment, and therefore remained ongoing; both patients  continued to receive study 
treatment. No  patient had a TEAE related to neutrophil counts  and no PCSV for low neutrophils led to 
treatment discontinuation.

In study R668-AD-1539 Part B, shifts from normal ECG status at baseline to  abnormal at week 16   were 
reported for 8 patients (13.8%)  in the placebo + TCS group and 11 patients (15.5%)  in th e  dupilumab + 
TCS group. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences between the treatment groups in incidence of  treatment-
emergent PCSVs related to ECG findings. No patient had an ECG abnormality that  was reported as a 
TEAE. In the cohort of patients  with  QTcF prolongations, there were no adverse events of Ventricular 
arrhythmia or Syncope. 
R668-AD-1434 
In study R668-AD-1434, ECG was only assessed prior to  protocol amendment 1, and hence was  not 
assessed for the age group included in  this submission. 
Physical Examination 
In study R668-AD-1539 Part B, there were no clinically meaningful shifts  from baseline in physical 
examination findings  observed in either treatment group.  
Physical examinations in  study R668-AD-1434 were performed at baseline and at  week 260. As at the 
data cutoff for the study, no patients aged ≥6 months to <6  years had reached week 260,  and  so 
physical examination data are not available. These data will  be provided in the final CSR. In study R668 -
AD-1539 Part A, physical examination findings  were consistent with  the population under study (AD). 
There were no shifts  from normal at baseline to abnormal post-baseline in physical examination status.

Overall, the percentage of subjects who were ADA -positive to dupilumab anytime post-baseline post dose 
was relatively low (22/151,  14.6%). 
Persistently positive ADA response was found in a few patients  5/151 (3.3%);  all of these had at  least 1

Subgroup analyses in patients with severe AD 
Patients with  severe AD were analysed separately as to safety aspects. Please see respective sections

Subgroup analyses in patients ≥6 months to < 2 years 
R668-AD-1539  Part B 
The safety results of the subgroup of patients  aged ≥6 months  to <2 years are presented in  Table 94 and 
Table 95. Overall, 10  patients were included in  this subgroup, 4/10 in  the PBO+TCS group and 6/10  in 
the DUP+TCS group. The proportion of patients  aged <2  years who had at least 1 TEAE during the 16 -
week treatment period was comparable between the PBO + TCS group (3/4;  75.0%) and the dupilumab 
+ TCS group (4/6;  66.7%).  One patient  in the DUP + TCS group had a TEAE that led to discontinuation  of 
study drug (see section above). All TEAEs were mild to moderate in  intensity. One patien t in the  DUP + 
TCS group had a TEAE, which was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. No deaths 
or SAEs were reported. 2 TEAEs were reported in more than  1 patient: Upper respiratory tract infection (2 
patients) and Dermatitis atopic (2 patients),  both in the DUP + TCS group; all other TEAEs were reported 
by 1 patient each.

In patients aged ≥6 months to <2  years, 14/20 patients  (70.0%) experienced a TEAE in the  4 -week post-
treatment period, with  the same incidence in  the 2 dose groups (7/10  [70%]). One patient (5.0%)  had a 
TEAE that  was severe in intensity, and 2 patients  (10.0%)  had events related to the  study drug. All but  3 
events in  2 patients were transient  and had resolved or were resolving at the time  of the data cutoff date. 
There was 1 serious TEAE, which  was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to  study dru g.

were all mild to  moderate in intensity and none led to permanent discontinuation  of study drug. The 
majority of events were deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. None of the  patients 
aged <2  years had SAEs and no deaths were reported. The most common TEAEs by PT (≥2 0%)  were 
Nasopharyngitis (7/19 [36.8%]),  Upper respiratory tract infection (7/19  [36.8%]),  Dermatitis atopic

Post marketing experience 
Dupilumab is not currently approved in patients  <6 years of age with  AD. However, a cumulative search 
with  a data lock point of 28 Sep 2021 was performed in the Sanofi global safety database to identify all 
post-marketing cases describing use of dupilumab in patients <6  years of age with  AD. There were 735 
post-marketing cases reported for DUPIXENT cumulatively up  to the data lock point  o f 28  Sep 2021  in 
this population.  For reference, post-marketing exposure to 30 Sep 2021  is estimated to be 522.786 
patient years. 
Of the 735 reports received, 727 (99%) were non-serious. Eight  of the 735 cases were serious; no fatal 
cases were reported. No trends or patterns were identified upon review of the serious cases.  Over 75% 
of the post-marketing cases reported use of dupilumab in  an underaged patient, and the majority did not 
report any other event. Consequently, the most frequently reported SOC w as Injury, poisoning, and 
procedural complications consisting mainly of reports of ‘Off-label use’ and ‘Product use issue’. The other 
most frequently reported SOCs were Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (Atopic Dermatitis and 
Pruritus were the  most commonly reported PTs) and General disorders and administration site conditions 
(Injection Site Reactions including  Injection site pain were the most commonly reported PTs).  
The post-marketing data do not suggest any new safety concerns for dupilumab.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety analysis sets (SAF) for each study included all patients who had received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. The safety data of the studies were not  pooled except for patient disposition/exposure, which 
is reasonable as regards the difference of study designs. Results are first presented and discussed for the 
pivotal study R668-AD-1539 Part B, followed by R668-AD-1539 Part A and the open-label extension study 
R668-AD-1434. 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 166/183 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disposition   
Overall, 162 patients  were enrolled in  study R668-AD-1539 Part B. 79/162 received PBO+TCS and 
83/162  received DUP 200/300  mg Q4W+TCS. Patients had a good treatment compliance, and the 
majority of both treatment  groups entered the OLE study R-668-AD-1434.  Only one patient  assigned to 
the DUP+TCS group discontinued the  treatment due to an Adverse Event, for further details, see 
information below. 
In R668-AD-1539 Part A, a total  40 patients  were enrolled. One patient withdrew  from study 
participation.  
The majority of patients continued dupilumab treatment  in the still  ongoing OLE study R668-AD-1434. In 
this study,  at data cut-off, no participant had completed the study, 167/180  (92.8%)  were being treated, 
and 13/180  (7.2%) had discontinued from the study, mainly due to withdrawal of consent for different 
reasons.  
Exposure 
The treatment exposure was balanced between both  treatment groups of the  pivotal study  R668-AD-1539 
Part B. The majority of patients  in the PBO+TCS group (93.6%)  and in  the DUP+TCS group (96.4%) 
received the planned 4  doses within  a mean treatment duration of 111 days (15.9 weeks).   
In R668-AD-1539 Part A, all 40 patients were exposed to a single weight-based dose of 3 mg/kg or  
6 mg/kg. For both age cohorts, the  median duration was similar (65% ≥ 29  days).  
In study R668-AD-1434, the  extent of exposure for the  180 included patients varied between 4 and <208 
weeks, the mean overall treatment exposure was 37.23  weeks (SD 43.02), median 21.0  weeks. The 
majority of patients (131/180  (72.8%) received dupilumab ≥ 16 weeks. Long-term safety data with  an 
overall cumulative treatment exposure of ≥ 52  weeks is available from 27/180  (15%) patients.  Exposure 
data according to the  claimed dose regimen is available for 118 (65.6%)  patients;  58 (32.2%)  received 
dupilumab ≥16  weeks, and 7 (3.9%) patients  for ≥52  weeks. 
Overall, 139/180  (77.2%)  patients received the dose regimen of 200/300  mg Q4W corresponding to the 
claimed posology without  switching the  dose regimen; additional  23/180 patients  coming from parent 
study R668-AD-1539 Part A changed to  the fixed dose. The dose was changed under protocol amendment 
4 for these patients  from weight-based to fixed dose tiered by body weight,  irrespective of age (200  mg 
Q4W for patients 5 to <15  kg, 300  mg Q4W for patients  15 to <30  kg, or 200 mg Q2W for patients 30  to 
<60kg). 
As regards pooled exposure data of all three studies (SAF), overall 193 patients had received at least 1 
dose of dupilumab in the  pooled studies. Until  data cut-off of 31 July 2021,  164/193  (85.0%)  had 
completed at least 16  weeks of treatment, and 31/193  (16.1%) patients  had completed at least 52 weeks 
of treatment. Updated safety data include additional  18 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment 
resulting in a total  number of 48 patients  completing 52 weeks of treatment. Combining both exposures 
of the parent and the OLE study, overall 90/180  (50%) patients  were exposed for ≥52  weeks, which is 
considered acceptable. Based on the analysis, no new safety concerns arise from the  updated safety data.  
Adverse events 
In Part B, a higher proportion of the PBO+TCS group experienced any treatment-emergent adverse 
events compared with  the verum group and more drug-related TEAEs were reported in the DUP+TCS 
group of patients  with  moderate-to-severe AD as well as in the  subgroup with  severe AD. One patient  in 
each group discontinued the  study due to  a treatment-emergent Adverse event (TEAE). The majority of 
events was mild to  moderate, severe TEAEs occurred more frequently in  the PBO+TCS. No treatment -

group were assessed unrelated. In the subgroup with  severe AD, results were similar; here, patients 
experienced slightly more mild and less drug-related TEAE compared with the moderate-to-severe study 
population. Preferred terms (PT) that  were reported with  a higher frequency in the verum group were 
Molluscum contagiosum, Conjunctivitis,  Gastroenteritis viral, and Rhinorrhea. These results are consistent 
between the subgroup with  severe AD and the total  SAF. The proportion of patients who had at least one 
treatment-related TEAE was higher in the  DUP+TCS group than in the PBO+TCS group, and also the 
subgroup with  severe AD. This difference was mainly driven by higher incidences of PTs Conjunctivitis, 
Eosinophilia and Blepharitis, known ADRs in  the AD population. 
In Part A, in cohort 1 (≥2  to <6 years) the TEAE frequency was balanced between the two  dose groups. 
2/10  (20%) of the 6 mg/kg cohort and 3/10 (30%)  of the  3 mg/kg cohort experienced unrelated TEAE of 
mild-to-moderate intensity in the  4-week treatment period. In the younger patient  cohort 2 (≥6  months 
to <2  years), 7/10 (70%)  of each dose group experienced TEAEs. Two dupilumab -related TEAEs occurred 
in the 6 mg/kg cohort (injection site erythema and diarrhea). SAEs were reported once in each age cohort 
(anaphylactic reactions due to a food allergy), case reports suggest that  both events were unrelated. The 
balance of incidences suggests no dose -response relationship; however, patient  numbers of this  study are 
too limited for a sound interpretation  of this  aspect.  
In study R668-AD-1434, 60.6%  had at least one TEAE, drug-related TEAEs were relatively rare, serious 
and severe TEAEs were very rare. Result in the subgroup with  severe AD were comparable, patients ha d 
less mild,  more moderate, however, no severe events. Most  were reported in SOC Infections and 
infestations where respiratory tract infections dominated. 6.7% of the participants had atopic dermatitis 
during the study, however, the frequency diminished ov er time when compared with Part B, also 
considering that  75 patients  had received PBO in the parent study resulting in a later onset of treatment 
benefit. A few patients reported hypersentitivity events which  were of uncomplicated nature. Overall, 
incidences were similar between SOCs of the parent studies and the OLE study. In the severe AD 
subgroup, patients experienced slightly more events, especially infections and infestations, however, 
incidences within  the  different SOCs were comparable. Three SAEs were reported, thus, the  frequency of 
severe TEAEs was low. The observed blepharitis and urticaria were considered related to  dupilumab, the 
latter lead to discontinuation  of the  study drug. Blepharitis is a known uncommon eye disorder associated 
with  dupilumab treatment and as such listed in SmPC section 4.8. All three events resolved over time.  
Most  frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were eye disorders such as conjunctivitis and 
blepharitis as well  as Urticaria, however, the frequencies we re very low. The SAE frequency was very low; 
2 SAEs of anaphylactic reaction and pneumonia occurred during the OLE study that  were considered 
unrelated and didn’t lead to study drug discontinuation.  No deaths were reported throughout  the pivotal 
and the open-label extension study. 
AESI 
The pre-specified medically significant events are considered acceptable due to their potential causal 
association with  dupilumab based on the mode of action or the known safety profile.  
In Part B, 1 patient  presented with  1 AESI of non-serious, severe, bilateral, ulcerating blepharitis that was 
ongoing at the time of transition  into the OLE study.  Skin infections occurred with  a higher frequency in 
the placebo group, no serious skin infections were observed in the verum grou p and infection types were 
typical for the  investigated population.  Herpes infections were balanced between the treatment groups. 
Conjunctivitis events (broad and narrow CMQ) occurred with  a higher frequency in the verum group 
(7.2%  vs. 1.3%  and 4.8%  vs. 0),  a known ADR in  the AD population under dupilumab treatment. 
Urticaria was reported in 4/78 (5.1%)  patients  assigned to the PBO+TCS group compared with  1/83 
(1.2%)  patients in the DUP+TCS group and in study R668-AD-1539  Part A, 1 patient  in each dose group 
in cohort 1 experienced Urticaria. In study R668-AD-1434,  overall 13/180 (7.2%)  patients experienced 
TEAEs associated with  Urticaria, 5  events occurred in patients <2  years. One Urticaria events in  a 4 -year-

old male patient  was severe, related and led to discontinuation  of the study drug. Urticaria events do  not 
meet the criteria for ADR determination for the time being as reasoned by the  MAH. 
The overall frequency of AESI was very low (1.7%)  in this study.   
Discontinuation  of the study drug 
Overall, 2 patients assigned to the dupilumab treatment  group discontinued  their dupilumab treatment, 
one during the parent study R668-AD-1539 Part B due to  an Atopic dermatitis flare and the  other during 
participation in R668-AD-1434  due to a non-serious, severe and dupilumab-related TEAE of urticaria. 
These low discontinuation  rates suggest a good tolerability in the studied population .   
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
In Part B, there were no patients  that had relevant laboratory test  abnormalities associated with  SAEs or 
TEAEs leading to  discontinuation of the study drug. Individual patients had an increase in eosinophil 
counts in the  dupilumab + TCS group with  a peak at week 4, and decreasing until  week 16.  
Treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant values (PCSV), defined as laboratory values outside 
the reference range under study drug treatment  with  potential clinical impl ications, were lower in the 
DUP+TCS group compared with  the PBO+TCS group as regards RBCs and platelets. With  regard to WBCs, 
15.9%  vs. 11.7%  had a PCSV of increased eosinophil count. 4 TEAEs of eosinophilia (2), neutropenia (1) 
and leukocytosis (1) were reported, however, these events resolved over time and were not associated 
with  clinical symptoms. During OLE study, PCSV related to raised eosinophil count was reported in 28.6% 
of the study participants, mostly of transient nature, and without  any associa ted TEAEs. A transient 
increase in blood eosinophil counts  is a known ADR in the  adult and paediatric population resulting  from 
dupilumab’s mode of action. As such, it is listed in section 4.8  of the  SmPC , and the description of this 
adverse reaction has been updated with  the results from study  AD -1539.  
As to clinical chemistry, a decrease in LDH,  a biomarker associated with AD disease activity and severity, 
was observed in the  verum group, which is a known pharmacodynamic effect of dupilumab and as such 
described in SmPC section 5.1. 
Vital signs, ECG parameters or results of physical examination were not meaningfully altered during the 
course of the studies. The observed changes may be interpreted within  the context of physiological 
changes or study procedures. 
Immunogenicity 
In Part B, 1/74  (1.4%) patients  exhibited a low titer,  Nab negative response. Based on this  low frequency 
of ADA response, a correlation between the  occurrence and nature of TEAEs and immunogenicity is not 
feasible. 
In Part A, in 19/40  (47.5%)  patients’ treatment-emergent ADA were found with  comparable incidences 
across the dose and age cohorts, the majority (42.5%)  thereof had low titers,  and the minority (7.5%) 
moderate titers, no high  titers were determined. Nab responses were observ ed in 27.5%.  
In R668-AD-1434, a persistently positive ADA response was found in a few patients 5/151  (3.3%). 7/151 
(4.6%)  patients had moderate or high ADA titers. Almost all patients with  any kind of ADA response 
(indeterminate, transient or persistent) had TEAEs without  any specific pattern. One case of serious, 
severe anaphylactic reaction was reported in  a patient  with  low-titer, transient  ADA response; this event 
was considered unrelated to  dupilumab, however, based on the narratives it  seems difficul t to clearly 
determine the  relationship between trigger and event.  
Overall, the immunogenic potential of dupilumab appears to be low in this  young paediatric population. 
During the Dupixent development program it was noticed that  single administrations le ad to  a higher rate 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023

of ADA responses whereas titers reverted after repeated dosing. Immune reactions occurred rarely in the 
investigated population, and the observed types do not differ from those that  were reported in previous 
studies, thus,  no new ADR were observed. It is, however, noted that  the overall study population is 
relatively small which hampers the significance of the study results.  Albeit that numbers are very small, 
there is no apparent increased trend towards immunogenicity in the under 2 -year-old age group versus 
the over 2 years age group. 
Post marketing data 
735 post-marketing cases were reported up to the data lock point of 28 Sep 2021  in patients <6  years of 
age with  AD following off-label use. 8/735  reports included serious adverse events. The  MAH provided an 
update of post-marketing data until  the latest  available cut-off (28 Sep 2021),  including  frequencies as to 
most frequently reported SOCs. The provided data confirm the  known safety profile in some way, 
however, as no exact PTs are listed, no exact assessment can be made.  
Safety in the  subgroup <2  years 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in  the patient subgroup ≥6 months  to <2 years is comparable between 
both treatment  groups in study R668-AD-1539  Parts A and B and incidences of individual PTs are 
comparable to those seen in the  overall study population.  The same applies to the  open -label extension 
study R668-AD-1434.  The most common TEAEs were infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal 
tract.  
These data are, however, to be interpreted with  caution as patient numbers in this subgroup are very 
limited, i.e. in pivotal study Part B, merely 10 patients were <2 years old, 6 thereof exposed to 
dupilumab, and in the OLE  study R668-AD-1434 only 19 patients. In in Part A, overall 20 patients were 
aged ≥6  months to <2  years, however, these patients  received a single SC dose of dupilumab. As stated  
in PIP01-13-M07  Summary Report 4.1  at D60, 16/20  joined the open label extension study and have 
been exposed to dupilumab  for over a year. In the  latest PIP modification M07,  the  MAH  requested a 
delay of 2 months in study completion of the pivotal paediatric safety and efficacy study (PIP Study 6) 
due to slower than  expected enrolment until March 2022.  The overall reduction of patient  numbers from 
240 to  120 for pivotal study Part B was agreed based on adequate power calculations. According to the 
MAH,  no age subset had been numerically predefined in  the PIP or requested by PDCO and limited patient 
numbers in this subgroup are the result of recruitment difficulties due to the pandemic a nd the 
recommended treatment algorithm with  topical therapies prior to commencing Dupixent therapy.  As few 
patients <  2 years were enrolled in the pivotal study, no sufficient long -term data is expectable for these 
patients within  the  scope of the OLE study. Based on additional 7 months of data from the OLE study, no 
new safety concerns arose. At the  CHMP request, the MAH  proposed to use a running  company sponsored 
disease registry in paediatric patients aged <12 years with  AD, entitled  ‘PEDISTAD’, to colle ct additional 
relevant safety data for the target population,  i.e. to include additional 500 patients  aged 6 months to  <6 
years who are currently receiving systemic or topical treatment and whose disease is not adequately 
controlled by topical prescription therapies or for whom  those therapies are not medically advisable. This 
approach is supported by the  CHMP, the study has been included in the RMP as a category 3 study and 
the protocol will be submitted for endorsement in Q3 2023. 
The interaction of dupilumab treatment and live or live-attenuated vaccines is currently unclear. The MAH 
will provide further data from the ongoing OLE study R668-AD-1434;  that will  inform on interaction  of 
dupilumab with  inactivated vaccines. At the moment, the concomitant administration  is not 
recommended, which is reflected in section 4.4 of the Product Information. This is considered suboptimal 
for prescribers as these types of vaccines used for basic immunisation  are administered between 12 and 
24 months  of age depending on national vaccination programmes. Based on the current data situation, 
vaccinations with  live or live-attenuated vaccines are recommended to be completed before initiation  of 
dupilumab treatment. As no dedicated clinical data is available, this  is accepted  for the time  being.

Safety across the paediatric population 
The overall TEAE frequencies are similar across the studies, children <12  years tended to experience less 
adverse events, especially drug-related TEAEs. The TEAE intensity  was comparable between the studies. 
Conjunctivitis cases were scarcer in the  youngest study population.  The comparison of the results 
suggests that  the safety profile of dupilumab is consistent across the  different study populations.  It is to 
be considered that the  populations and designs are not  exactly comparable regarding disease severity at 
baseline, concomitant  medications and exposures, and thus, the results provide an approximate 
indication as to consistency of the safety profile. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Dupixent in children ≥6 months to  <6 years of age with  severe Atopic dermatitis 
whose disease could not  be adequately controlled with  topical medications was consistent with  the 
hitherto known safety profile. No new ADRs were identified based on the submitted  data. The final CSR of 
the OLE study will  be submitted to provide further long-term safety data. A limitation  is the very limited 
long-term data, especially in paediatric patients  <2 years of age. The MAH committed  to conduct a 
registry-based PASS for a further characterisation of the safety profile in infants and young children; 
overall, 40-60  children are anticipated for participation  in this study which  is a limited number of patients 
but  is deemed to  reflect the general recruitment issues encountered with  the pivotal study. This approach 
is, however, endorsed by the CHMP as this category 3  PASS (included in  the RMP) is considered an 
appropriate risk-proportionate data source.

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication,  sections 4.1,  4.2, 4.4,  4.8, 5.1  and 5.2  of the  SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with  target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted  by the  MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 174/183 
 
 
 
 
Dupilumab 300 mg and 200 mg pre-filled syringes are already approved in the EU and no further 
strengths or presentations are proposed for use in the new proposed indication.  Full user testing was 
performed previously.  
The new indication will cover an additional age category 6-month-old to  5 years old children similarly to 
the age range of children 6  to 11 years of age already included via Variation EMEA/H/C/004390/II/27).  In 
case of administration at home the parent /caregiver should be properly trained by the doctor/HCP, this  is 
already included in the SmPC. The changes related to the content  and layout in  the package leaflet are 
minor (section 1, 2 and 3) and a full user testing  or bridging  report is not necessary.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
AD is the most common inflammatory skin condition of childhood. It affects 15 –30% of children and it is 
particularly common in industrialised countries worldwide. The disease is characterised by chronic and 
relapsing pruritic  skin lesions that generally develop in early childhood, usually between 3 and 6 months 
of age. Approximately 60% of patients develop eczematous lesions in the first year of life and 90% by 5 
years of age (Huang et  al, 2017).   
Clinical presentation of AD in infants (≤1  year) involves lesions that  often emerge in the first few months 
of life, affecting the  cheeks with pruritic papules and papulovesicles that form oozing plaques with  crust. 
In addition, the scalp, neck, extensor extremities, and trunk may be diffusely affected by inflammatory 
lesions. After 1 to 2  years, lesions can still be acute; however, lichenified, chronic lesions begin to 
predominate with  a predilection for flexural sites. In addition, hand and foot dermatitis as well as 
nummular plaques with  oozing and crusting on the hands and wrists can appear (Nomura, 2020). Linear 
excoriations due to scratching are common. The background nonlesional skin is often xerotic, and there 
may be plate-like ichthyosis of the distal  extremities, especially in older children. The cycle of itching and 
scratching exacerbates the cellular damage in skin lesions and facilitates secondary infections, which can 
be serious (Boguniewicz, 2018). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As non-pharmacological therapeutic measures, moisturizers are the cornerstone of all AD regimens. 
Xerosis is one of the main clinical features of AD, and results from a dysfunctional epidermal barrier that 
leads to  increased transepidermal water loss. Topical moisturizers combat xerosis through a combination 
of ingredients that maintain  skin hydration, such as emollients. Daily bathing  with  warm water is 
beneficial in AD therapy by hydrating the skin and removing serous crusts, allergens, and irritants 
(Eichenfield et al, 2014).  Bleach baths demonstrated efficacy in clinically improving moderate -to-severe 
AD in children (Wong et al, 2013). 
Similar to  the adult and adolescent populations,  topical treatment is the mainstay of management of AD 
in children. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) of varying potency represent the cornerstone of topical 
treatment and some low potency TCS are approved in pediatric patients  <1 -year-old. However, their 
long-term use or application to the  large body -surface area is limited  by the  risk of local and systemic 
side effects, such as Cushing’s syndrome, growth retardation, hyperglycemia, hirsutism, glaucoma, 
adrenal insufficiency and tachyphylaxis. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), such as tacrolimus and 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 175/183 
 
 
 
 
pimecrolimus, are also available for use in children, mostly as second-line therapy as an alternative to or 
in combination with  TCS. Use of these agents is typically limited to  areas that are prone to skin atrophy 
from application of TCS, (eg, face, genitals, and flexural areas), h owever, their use bears the risk of skin 
malignancies and of lymphomas.  
Patients with  severe disease are often treated off-label with systemic therapies such as corticosteroids 
and immunosuppressive drugs harboring the risk of severe side effects and lack ing dedicated safety and 
efficacy data. The described limitations result in a large number of pediatric patients  with  severe AD 
whose disease cannot be safely controlled by the existing therapies. Therefore, there exists a significant 
unmet medical need for a treatment  that is safe and effective for long-term use, especially for pediatric 
patients with  severe forms of the disease not adequately controlled by topical prescription therapies.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is supported by 3 clinical studies: the  pivotal completed phase 3 study R668-AD 1539-
Part B, and two  supportive studies R668-AD 1539-Part A (completed Phase 2) and R668-AD-1434 
(ongoing open-label extension study, OLE).  
R668-AD-1539  Part B was a phase 3,  pivotal, multicenter,  randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study in children aged ≥6  months to <6 years of age with  moderate -to-severe 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) whose disease could not be adequately controlled with  topical medications. 
Patients received the following treatments: Placebo (PBO) + low potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) or 
dupilumab (DUP) 200 mg/300  mg Q4W + TCS over a period of 16 weeks. The dosing was tiered by body 
weight,  i.e. patients with  baseline body weight  ≥5 kg to <15  kg received 200 mg Q4 W, those with 
baseline body weight ≥15  kg to  <30 kg received 300 mg Q4W. 
The co-primary endpoint was the proportion of patients  with IGA 0  or 1 at week 16 and the proportion of 
patients with  EASI-75 at week 16. The key secondary endpoints were the percent change in EASI score 
from baseline to week 16 and the  percent change from baseline to  week 16 in weekly average of daily 
worst scratch/itch NRS score. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
R668-AD-1539  Part B (pivotal phase  3 study) 
In the overall population, the proportion of all patients  achieving IGA scores of 0 or 1 at  Week 16 was 
numerically higher in the DUP+TCS group compared with  the PBO+TCS group (23/83,  27.7% vs. 3/79, 
3.9%,  p<0.0001).  The results of the sensitivity analysis considering all observed values regardless of 
rescue treatment were consistent with  the primary analysis (25/83,  30.1%  vs. 4/79,  5.1%).  
The proportion of all patients achieving EASI-75 at Week 16 was higher in  the DUP+TCS group compared 
with  the PBO+TCS group (44/83,  53.0% vs. 8/79, 10.7%,  p<0.0001),  supported by the results of the 
sensitivity analysis considering all observed values regardless of rescue treatment  (53/83, 63.9% vs. 
13/79,  16.5%, p<0.0001).   
The Percent Change from Baseline in EASI Score at Week 16 in Study R668-AD-1539 Part B declined by -
70 in the  DUP+TCS group (mean %Change -63.1)  and by -19.6  (mean %Change -11.4)  in the PBO+TCS 
group with  a statistically  significant LS mean difference in the  percent change from baseline to  week 16 
between both treatment groups, i.e. -50.4  (-62.38,  -38.40).   
The Percent Change from Baseline to Week 16  in Weekly Average of Worst Scratch/Itch NRS Score from 
Baseline to Week 16  was −49.4%  in the  DUP+TCS group vs. −2.2%  in the PBO+TCS group, LS mean 
difference -47.1.  This effect was also observed very early.  
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 176/183 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of patients  with improvement of weekly average of daily worst scratch/itch NRS score ≥4 
or ≥3 from Baseline at  Week 16 was higher in  the DUP+TCS group compared with  the PBO+TCS group 
(≥4 points:  48.1% vs. 8.9%,  p<0.0001;  ≥3 points: 53.3%  vs. 9.9%, p<0.0001)  as of week 2.  
The analysis of further EASI endpoints, i.e. the proportion of patients  in the FAS achieving EASI -50 and -
90, or endpoints assessing AD severity as Change from baseline to week 16 in SCORAD/Percent BSA 
affected by AD, showed that  treatment with  dupilumab combined with  TCS improved AD symptoms more 
effectively than placebo and TCS. This is also reflected by results regarding observer - or patient-reported 
assessments related to  treatment effects on sleep quality,  skin pain, POEM  and others.   
In the subgroup of patients  with  severe AD (IGA 4 at baseline), the  proportion of patients who  achieved 
IGA scores of 0 or 1  at Week 16 was also larger in  the verum group (9/63, 14.3%  vs. 1/62. 1.7%).   
The proportion of patients  achieving EASI-75 at  Week 16 in the DUP+TCS group was higher compared 
with  the PBO+TCS group (29/63,  46.0% vs. 4/62, 7.8%). 
R668-AD-1434  (OLE study)  
Proportion of patients  achieving IGA 0 or 1 was 12.8% (BL), 21.6%  (week 4),  33.1% (week 16), 38.6% 
(week 52).  Proportion of patients with  severe AD achieving IGA 0 or 1 was 0 (week 4),  20.8% (Week 16), 
and 26.9% (Week 52). 
Proportion of patients  achieving EASI-75 relative to baseline of previous study was 29.4% (BL),  57.4% 
(week 4),  70.9% (week 16), and 81.8% (week 52). 
Mean % change in EASI score from baseline of previous study  was -50.26  (BL), -71.05  (week 4),  -78.97 
(week 16),  and 86.11 (week 52). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
R668-AD-1539  Part B 
The study was not planned and analy sed according to the applied indication (severe AD), but  rather for 
the indication  moderate-to-severe AD. The provided primary efficacy results performed on the FAS 
(moderate-to-severe AD) are mainly driven by the  patients with  moderate AD and, therefore, n ot  entirely 
transferable to the population  with severe AD. The analyses restricted to  the subgroup of patients  with 
severe AD was not  included in the multiple  testing strategy which leads to  a lack of type 1 error control 
for these analyses. Further  key analyses restricted to the subgroups indicate a consistent treatment effect 
in both  populations and mitigate  the statistical  issues in some way. From a clinical perspective however, 
the totality  of evidence from the clinical program is considered adequate to   support the nominally 
statistically significant  difference between the  dupilumab and placebo arms reported for the severe AD 
population. In addition,  the moderate-to-severe multiplicity-controlled endpoints,  at time of final analysis, 
was made up of 75% of patients (125/162)  with severe disease at baseline thus  the efficacy results in  the 
overall population was represented in majority by the severe patients.  In addition, the current approved 
indication for patients 6 years-11 years old in the EU  is ‘severe AD’, maintaining continuity  across 
paediatric age groups at  this time point  is endorsed by the CHMP.  Therefore the applied indication  (severe 
AD) was agreed by the CHMP. 
A minority of study participants was ≥6  months to <2 years old, further subgroup analyses were 
performed and a trend towards higher clinical benefit caused by dupilumab treatment is observed in the 
younger patients  in the pivotal and the open-label extension study. Further data for this age group will  be 
submitted  with the  final results of the OLE study.   
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 177/183 
 
 
 
 
 
R668-AD-1434 
48/180  (26.7%)  patients ≥6 months  to <6 years of age completed at least 52,  thus, long -term efficacy is 
limited. The final CSR will  be submitted  when available to provide further long -term efficacy data. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
R668-AD-1539  Part B 
Common TEAEs by PT that  were reported with  a higher frequency in the DUP+TCS group were , 
Rhinorrhea (4.8%  vs. 1.3%),  Molluscum contagiosum (4.8%  vs. 2.6%),  Conjunctivitis (3.6%  vs. 0),  viral 
Gastroenteritis (3.6% vs. 0), and dental caries (4.8%  vs. 0). Conjunctivitis  occurred with  a higher 
incidence in the dupilumab treatment groups, however, eye disorders such as conjunctivit is,  keratitis and 
blepharitis were identified as ADRs throughout  the clinical development programme in the AD population.  
Slightly more drug-related TEAEs were reported in the DUP+TCS group (10.8% vs. 6.4%) in  patients with 
moderate-to-severe AD, as well as in the subgroup with  severe AD (12.7% vs. 8.2%).   
During study R668-AD-1539 Part B, Urticaria was reported in  4/78 (5.1%)  patients assigned to the 
PBO+TCS group compared with 1/83  (1.2%)  patients in the DUP+TCS group and in study R668 -AD-1539 
Part A, 1  patient in each dose group in cohort 1 experienced Urticaria. In the open -label extension study 
R668-AD-1434,  overall, 13/180 (7.2%)  patients experienced TEAEs associated with  Urticaria, 5/19 
(26.2%)  events occurred in patients  <2 years. One Urticaria event in 4-year-old male patient was severe, 
related and led to discontinuation  of the study drug. 
No events of or clinically symptomatic eosinophilia or malignancy were reported, however, there is 
insufficient data on long-term exposure to characterise the risk for developing malignancy. 
R668-AD-1539  Part A 
In Part A, 19/40  (47.5%)  participants developed treatment-emergent ADA.  
R668-AD-1434 
In R668-AD-1434, a persistently positive ADA response was found in 5/151  (3.3%) patients.  4/151 
(2.6%)  patients had moderate or high ADA titers. One case of serious, severe anaphylactic reaction was 
reported in a patient  with low-titer,  transient ADA response; this  event was considered unrelated to 
dupilumab, however, based on the  narratives it seems difficult  to clearly determine the relationship 
between trigger and event. TEAEs observed in >1  patient with  a persistently positive ADA response 
during the study were Nasopharyngitis, Upper respiratory tract infection, Rhinitis,  Pyrexia, Dermatitis 
atopic, and Skin laceration. 
In conclusion no new safety signals associated with the  use of dupilumab in  paediatric patients 6 months 
to < 6 years were identified. The overall safety profile was consistent with  that  seen in other  age groups 
in the dupilumab development program. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate, severe TEAEs occurred more frequently in the PBO+TCS 
group compared with the  DUP+TCS group (12.8% vs. 2.4%).  No TE-SAE was reported in  the DUP+TCS 
group. 
The observed difference in drug-related TEAEs was mainly driven by higher incidences of PTs 
Conjunctivitis, Eosinophilia and Blepharitis, which are known ADRs in  the AD population.  Cases of 
conjunctivitis should continue  to be monitored in the  RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/66726/2023 
Page 178/183 
 
 
 
 
Almost all patients with  any kind of ADA response (indeterminate, transient or persistent) had TEAEs 
without  any specific pattern. In Part A, 3/40 patients  had a moderate titer,  no high titer was observed. 
Reported TEAEs in ADA positive patients were 2  events of anaphylactic reaction, one in  each age cohort , 
these were, however, considered unrelated to dupilumab. Immune reactions occurred rarely in the 
investigated population, and the observed types do not differ from those that  were reported in previous 
studies. During the Dupixent development program it  wa s noticed that  single administrations lead to a 
higher rate of ADA responses whereas titers reverted after repeated dosing.  
The interaction of dupilumab treatment and live or live -attenuated vaccines is currently unclear. The MAH 
will provide further data from the ongoing OLE study R668-AD-1434  that will  inform on interaction of 
dupilumab with  inactivated vaccines. The concomitant  administration is not recommended, which is 
reflected in the  Product Information. 
The number of paediatric patients in the 6 month  – 2-year age group compared to the other age group 
was relatively low, making it  difficult to  fully characterise the long -term safety profile. It is appreciated 
however that  there were challenges in recruiting children in this age bracket to the  trial,  and that the 
same challenges would  exist in  another trial. The MAH  committed to conduct a  registry based PASS study 
to collect more long-term safety data in  the age 6 month  - 6-year age group. In addition the  final CSR of 
the OLE study will  be submitted to provide further long-term safety data.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Currently, there is an unmet medical need for systemic therapies in AD in patients  <6 years of age. Oral 
corticosteroids are often used to control severe forms of AD that  are inadequately controlled by topi cal 
treatments. Additionally, other systemic immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine are commonly 
used off-label due to lacking therapeutic alternatives. However, all of them harbour serious safety issues 
as to long-term use, especially for paediatric patients.  The beneficial treatment effects of dupilumab

200/300  mg Q4W combined with  TCS in patients with  severe AD who are inadequately controlled by 
topical therapies has been demonstrated. The provided controlled data on short-term use (16  weeks) 
showed statistically significant and clinically relevant treatment results in favour of dupilumab.   
As immunomodulatory drug with  a subcutaneous route of administration, the most relevant safety 
concerns of dupilumab generally are associated with  hypersensitiv ity reactions, (helminthic) infections, 
and immunogenicity and effects on the immature system in children <6  years. There were no reported 
events of anaphylactic reactions (assessed as related to study drug by the  investigator) or systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions in either treatment group. In terms of infections, the overall incidence was 
higher in the placebo group; no helminthic  infections were reported. The observed treatment -emergent 
adverse events were predominantly mild to moderate and common viral infections prevailed as typical for 
this age class. Conjunctivitis  occurred with a higher incidence in  the dupilumab treatment groups, 
however, eye disorders such as conjunctivitis,  keratitis and blepharitis were identified as ADRs throughout 
the clinical development programme in the AD population. The long-term effect of chronic conjunctivitis in 
these patients is currently unknown. Therefore, cases of conjunctivitis should continue  to be monitored in 
the RMP.  
No events of or clinically symptomatic eosinophilia or malignancy were reported, however, there is 
insufficient data on long-term exposure to characterise the risk for developing malignancy. This issue ha s 
been discussed during the initial  MAA for AD , subject to  investigation in the OLE study. 
The available immunogenicity data did not  show a clinically significant effect of ADA on safety , this 
suggests a low immunogenic potential  of dupilumab in the investigated population.   
The interaction of dupilumab treatment and live or live -attenuated vaccines is currently unclear. The MAH 
will provide further data from the ongoing OLE study R668-AD-1434  that will  inform on interaction of 
dupilumab with  inactivated vaccines. At the moment, the concomitant administration  is not 
recommended, which is reflected in the Product Information. This is considered suboptimal for prescribers 
as these types of vaccines used for basic immunisation  are administered between 12 and 24 months  of 
age depending on national vaccination programmes. Based on the  current data situation,  vaccinations 
with  live or live-attenuated vaccines are recommended to be completed before initiation  of dupilumab 
treatment. As no dedicated clinical data is available, this is accep ted for the time being.  
Overall, the available dataset in patients <2  years is very limited  due to  recruitment problems which was 
thoroughly discussed by the MAH.  The MAH  commits to conduct a category 3 PASS in order to further 
characterise the safety profile in the 6-month  to 2-year age group. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The therapeutic need of dupilumab in paediatric patients aged ≥6  months to <6  years with severe AD is 
acknowledged. The favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects.  The totality of evidence from 
the clinical program is considered adequate to  support the statistically significant  difference between the 
dupilumab and placebo arms reported for the severe AD population.  However, the numbers of paediatric 
patients in  the 6 month – 2-year age group compared to the other age group was still relatively low, 
making it difficult  to fully characterise the long-term safety profile. It is acknowledged, however, that 
there were challenges in recruiting children in this  age bracket to  the trial , and that  the same challenges 
would exist in another trial. The long term safety profile will  be further characterised in the post-
authorisation setting  : a registry-based PASS is planned by the  MAH. In addition the  final CSR of the OLE 
study will be submitted  to provide further long-term efficacy and safety data.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of dupilumab is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted  data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to  the terms of the Marketing Authorisation,  concerning the following 
change: 
Variation  accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to  therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication  or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of severe atopic dermatitis  in paediatric patients from 6 
months to <6  years of age based on final results from Study R668-AD-1539;  this is a phase 2/3 study 
investigating the  pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of dupilumab in patients  aged ≥6  Months to  <6 
years with  moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2,  4.4, 4.8,  5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 9.0 of the RMP has also been approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to  the Summary of Product Characteristics and Packag e Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted  with  the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to  the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0329/2021  and the  results of these studies are reflected in  the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the  Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this  variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will  be updated as follows:

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for apixaban, the scientific 
conclusions of the  CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data from the  literature including  cases with  a positive dechallenge with  time-to-
onset (TTO) of 2 weeks or less, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between apixaban and 
cutaneous vasculitis is at  least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that  the product 
information of products containing apixaban should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the Marketing  Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for apixaban the CHMP  is of the opinion that  the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing apixaban is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

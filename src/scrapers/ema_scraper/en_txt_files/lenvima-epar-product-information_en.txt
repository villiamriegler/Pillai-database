CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (DTC) 
LENVIMA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, locally 
advanced or metastatic, differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma (DTC), 
refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI). 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) 
LENVIMA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with  
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received no prior systemic 
therapy (see section 5.1). 
Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) 
LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma (EC) who have disease progression on or following prior 
treatment with a platinum-containing therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery 
or radiation.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
LENVIMA treatment should be initiated and supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in 
the use of anticancer therapies. 
Optimal medical management (i.e., treatment or therapy) for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea should 
be initiated prior to any lenvatinib therapy interruption or dose reduction; gastrointestinal toxicity 
should be actively treated in order to reduce the risk of development of renal impairment or failure 
(see section 4.4). 
Posology 
If a patient misses a dose, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be skipped and 
the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. 
Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) 
The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 24 mg (two 10-mg capsules and one 4-mg capsule) once 
daily. The daily dose is to be modified as needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan. 
Dose adjustments and discontinuations for DTC 
Management of adverse reactions may require dose interruption, adjustment, or discontinuation of 
lenvatinib therapy (see section 4.4). Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally 
do not warrant interruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management. 
Severe (e.g., Grade 3) or intolerable adverse reactions require interruption of lenvatinib until 
improvement of the reaction to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline. 
For lenvatinib-related toxicities (see Table 4), upon resolution/improvement of an adverse reaction to 
Grade 0 to 1 or baseline, treatment should be resumed at a reduced dose of lenvatinib as suggested in 
Table 1.

Further dose reductions should be considered on an individual patient basis as limited data 
are available for doses below 10 mg. 
Treatment should be discontinued in case of life-threatening reactions (e.g., Grade 4) with the 
exception of laboratory abnormalities judged to be non-life-threatening, in which case they should be 
managed as severe reactions (e.g., Grade 3). 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 8 mg (two 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients with a 
body weight of < 60 kg and 12 mg (three 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients with a body weight of 
≥ 60 kg. Dose adjustments are based only on toxicities observed and not on body weight changes 
during treatment. The daily dose is to be modified, as needed, according to the dose/toxicity 
management plan.

Dose adjustments and Discontinuation for HCC 
Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption, adjustment, or discontinuation 
of lenvatinib therapy. Mild to moderate adverse reactions (e.g., Grade 1 or 2) generally do not warrant 
interruption of lenvatinib, unless intolerable to the patient despite optimal management. For 
lenvatinib-related toxicities, see Table 4. Details for monitoring, dose adjustment and discontinuation 
are provided in Table 2.

Special populations 
DTC 
Patients of age ≥75 years, of Asian race, with comorbidities (such as hypertension, and hepatic or 
renal impairment), or body weight below 60 kg appear to have reduced tolerability to lenvatinib (see 
section 4.8). All patients other than those with severe hepatic or renal impairment (see below) should 
initiate treatment at the recommended 24-mg dose, following which the dose should be further 
adjusted on the basis of individual tolerability. 
HCC 
Patients ≥75 years, of white race or female sex or those with worse baseline hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh A score of 6 compared to score of 5) appear to have reduced tolerability to lenvatinib.  
HCC patients other than those with moderate and severe hepatic impairment or severe renal 
impairment should initiate treatment at the recommended starting dose of 8 mg (two 4-mg capsules) 
for body weight < 60 kg and 12 mg (three 4-mg capsules) for body weight ≥ 60 kg, following which 
the dose should be further adjusted on the basis of individual tolerability. 
Patients with hypertension 
Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to treatment with lenvatinib, and should be regularly 
monitored during treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
DTC 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of hepatic function in patients with mild (Child-
Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. In patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) 
hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 14 mg taken once daily. Further dose 
adjustments may be necessary on the basis of individual tolerability. Refer also to section 4.8. 
HCC 
In the patient populations enrolled in the HCC study no dose adjustments were required on the basis of 
hepatic function in those patients who had mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). The available 
very limited data are not sufficient to allow for a dosing recommendation for HCC patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in 
these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Lenvatinib has not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) and is not recommended for use in these patients. 
EC 
Limited data are available for the combination of lenvatinib with pembrolizumab in patients with 
hepatic impairment. No adjustment of starting dose of the combination is required on the basis of 
hepatic function in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. 
In patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose of 
lenvatinib is 10 mg taken once daily. Please refer to the SmPC for pembrolizumab for dosing in 
patients with hepatic impairment. Further dose adjustments may be necessary on the basis of 
individual tolerability. 
Patients with renal impairment 
DTC 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended starting dose 
is 14 mg taken once daily. Further dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual tolerability. 
Patients with end-stage renal disease were not studied, therefore the use of lenvatinib in these patients 
is not recommended (see section 4.8). 
HCC 
No dose adjustments are required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. The available data do not allow for a dosing recommendation for patients with HCC and 
severe renal impairment. 
EC 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of renal function in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended starting dose 
is 10 mg of lenvatinib taken once daily. Please refer to the SmPC for pembrolizumab for dosing in 
patients with renal impairment. Further dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual 
tolerability. Patients with end-stage renal disease have not been studied, therefore the use of lenvatinib 
in these patients is not recommended.

Elderly population 
No  adjustment  of  starting  dose  is  required  on  the  basis  of  age.  Limited  data  are  available  on  use  in 
patients aged ≥75 years (see section 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in children aged 2 to <18 years have not been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Lenvatinib should not be used in children younger than 2 years of age because of safety concerns 
identified in animal studies (see section 5.3).  
Race 
No adjustment of starting dose is required on the basis of race (see section 5.2). Limited data are 
available on use in patients from ethnic origins other than Caucasian or Asian (see section 4.8). 
Method of administration 
Lenvatinib is for oral use. The capsules should be taken at about the same time each day, with or 
without food (see section 5.2). Caregivers should not open the capsule, in order to avoid repeated 
exposure to the contents of the capsule. 
Lenvatinib capsules can be swallowed whole with water or administered as a suspension prepared by 
dispersing the whole capsule(s) in water, apple juice, or milk. The suspension may be administered 
orally or via a feeding tube. If administered via a feeding tube, then the suspension should be prepared 
using water (see section 6.6 for preparation and administration of suspension).  
If not used at the time of preparation, lenvatinib suspension may be stored in a covered container and 
must be refrigerated at 2ºC to 8ºC for a maximum of 24 hours. After removal from the refrigerator the 
suspension should be shaken for approximately 30 seconds before use. If not administered within 24 
hours, the suspension should be discarded.  
For use in combination with pembrolizumab, refer to the SmPC for pembrolizumab.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6).  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypertension 
Hypertension has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in the 
course of treatment (see section 4.8). Blood pressure (BP) should be well controlled prior to treatment 
with lenvatinib and, if patients are known to be hypertensive, they should be on a stable dose of 
antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week prior to treatment with lenvatinib. Serious complications 
of poorly controlled hypertension, including aortic dissection, have been reported. The early detection 
and effective management of hypertension are important to minimise the need for lenvatinib dose 
interruptions and reductions. Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP is 
confirmed. BP should be monitored after 1 week of treatment with lenvatinib, then every 2 weeks for 
the first 2 months, and monthly thereafter. The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be 
individualised to the patient’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice. For 
previously normotensive subjects, monotherapy with one of the classes of antihypertensives should be 
started when elevated BP is observed. For those patients already on an antihypertensive medicinal 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
product, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a 
different class of antihypertensive should be added. When necessary, manage hypertension as 
recommended in Table 5.

BP ≤95 mmHg, and patient has been on a 
stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for 
at least 48 hours,  
resume lenvatinib at a reduced dose (see 
section 4.2) 
Life-threatening consequences 
(malignant hypertension, neurological deficit, 
or hypertensive crisis) 
Urgent intervention is indicated. Discontinue 
lenvatinib and institute appropriate medical 
management. 
Aneurysms and artery dissections  
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating lenvatinib, this risk should be 
carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in the course 
of treatment (see section 4.8). Urine protein should be monitored regularly. If urine dipstick 
proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see 
section 4.2). Cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported in patients using lenvatinib. Lenvatinib 
should be discontinued in the event of nephrotic syndrome. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In DTC, liver-related adverse reactions most commonly reported in patients treated with lenvatinib 
included increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood 
bilirubin. Hepatic failure and acute hepatitis (<1%; see section 4.8) have been reported in patients with 
DTC treated with lenvatinib. The hepatic failure cases were generally reported in patients with 
progressive metastatic liver metastases disease.  
In HCC patients treated with lenvatinib in the REFLECT trial, liver-related adverse reactions 
including hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure (including fatal reactions) were reported at a 
higher frequency (see Section 4.8) compared to patients treated with sorafenib . Patients with worse 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hepatic impairment and/or greater liver tumour burden at baseline had a higher risk of developing 
hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic failure. Hepatic encephalopathy also occurred more frequently in 
patients aged 75 years and older. Approximately half of the events of hepatic failure and one third of 
the events of the hepatic encephalopathy were reported in patients with disease progression. 
Data in HCC patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) are very limited and there are 
currently no data available in HCC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Since 
lenvatinib is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism, an increase in exposure in patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment is expected. 
In EC, liver-related adverse reactions most commonly reported in patients treated with lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab included increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST). Hepatic failure and hepatitis (<1%; see section 4.8) have been reported in patients with EC 
treated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab.  
Close monitoring of the overall safety is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Liver function tests should be monitored before initiation of 
treatment, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter during treatment. Patients 
with HCC should be monitored for worsening liver function including hepatic encephalopathy. In the 
case of hepatotoxicity, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see 
section 4.2). 
Renal failure and impairment 
Renal impairment and renal failure have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see 
section 4.8). The primary risk factor identified was dehydration and/or hypovolemia due to 
gastrointestinal toxicity. Gastrointestinal toxicity should be actively managed in order to reduce the 
risk of development of renal impairment or renal failure. Dose interruptions, adjustments, or 
discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2). 
If patients have severe renal impairment, the initial dose of lenvatinib should be adjusted (see sections 
4.2 and 5.2). 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea has been reported frequently in patients treated with lenvatinib, usually occurring early in 
the course of treatment (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management of diarrhoea should be 
instituted in order to prevent dehydration. Lenvatinib should be discontinued in the event of 
persistence of Grade 4 diarrhoea despite medical management. 
Cardiac dysfunction 
Cardiac failure (<1%) and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction have been reported in patients 
treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms or signs 
of cardiac decompensation, as dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary 
(see section 4.2). 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS) 
PRES, also known as RPLS, has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (<1%; see 
section 4.8). PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, 
confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to 
severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the 
diagnosis of PRES. Appropriate measures should be taken to control blood pressure (see section 4.4). 
In patients with signs or symptoms of PRES, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may 
be necessary (see section 4.2). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arterial thromboembolisms 
Arterial thromboembolisms (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic attack, and myocardial 
infarction) have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8). Lenvatinib has not 
been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolism within the previous 6 months, and 
therefore should be used with caution in such patients. A treatment decision should be made based 
upon an assessment of the individual patient's benefit/risk. Lenvatinib should be discontinued 
following an arterial thrombotic event. 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking lenvatinib and 
for one month after stopping treatment (see section 4.6). It is currently unknown if lenvatinib increases 
the risk of thromboembolic events when combined with oral contraceptives. 
Haemorrhage 
Serious tumour related bleeds, including fatal haemorrhagic events have occurred in clinical trials and 
have been reported in post-marketing experience (see section 4.8). In post-marketing surveillance, 
serious and fatal carotid artery haemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in DTC or other tumour types. The degree of tumour 
invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g., carotid artery) should be considered because of the 
potential risk of severe haemorrhage associated with tumour shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib 
therapy. Some cases of bleeding have occurred secondarily to tumour shrinkage and fistula formation, 
e.g., tracheo-oesophageal fistulae. Cases of fatal intracranial haemorrhage have been reported in some 
patients with or without brain metastases. Bleeding in sites other than the brain (e.g., trachea, 
intra-abdominal, lung) has also been reported. One fatal case of hepatic tumour haemorrhage in a 
patient with HCC has been reported. 
Screening for and subsequent treatment of oesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis should 
be performed as per standard of care before starting treatment with lenvatinib 
In the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be required (see 
section 4.2, Table 3). 
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation 
Gastrointestinal perforation or fistulae have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see 
section 4.8). In most cases, gastrointestinal perforation and fistulae occurred in patients with risk 
factors such as prior surgery or radiotherapy. In the case of a gastrointestinal perforation or fistula, 
dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary (see section 4.2). 
Non-gastrointestinal fistula 
Patients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with lenvatinib. Cases 
of fistula formation or enlargement that involve areas of the body other than stomach or intestines 
were observed in clinical trials and in post-marketing experience (e.g., tracheal, tracheo-oesophageal, 
oesophageal, cutaneous, female genital tract fistulae). In addition, pneumothorax has been reported 
with and without clear evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Some reports of fistula and pneumothorax 
occurred in association with tumour regression or necrosis. Prior surgery and radiotherapy may be 
contributing risk factors. Lung metastases may also increase the risk of pneumothorax. Lenvatinib 
should not be started in patients with fistula to avoid worsening and lenvatinib should be permanently 
discontinued in patients with oesophageal or tracheobronchial tract involvement and any Grade 4 
fistula (see section 4.2); limited information is available on the use of dose interruption or reduction in 
management of other events, but worsening was observed in some cases and caution should be taken. 
Lenvatinib may adversely affect the wound healing process as for other agents of the same class. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QT interval prolongation  
QT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported at a higher incidence in patients treated with 
lenvatinib than in patients treated with placebo (see section 4.8). Electrocardiograms should be 
monitored at baseline and periodically during treatment in all patients with particular attention to those 
with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and those taking 
medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. 
Lenvatinib should be withheld in the event of development of QT interval prolongation >500 ms. 
Lenvatinib should be resumed at a reduced dose when QTc prolongation is resolved to <480 ms or 
baseline. 
Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesaemia increase the risk 
of QT prolongation; therefore, electrolyte abnormalities should be monitored and corrected in all 
patients before starting treatment. Electrolytes (magnesium, potassium and calcium) should be 
monitored periodically during treatment. Blood calcium levels should be monitored at least monthly 
and calcium should be replaced as necessary during lenvatinib treatment. Lenvatinib dose should be 
interrupted or dose adjusted as necessary depending on severity, presence of ECG changes, and 
persistence of hypocalcaemia. 
Impairment of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression/ Thyroid dysfunction 
Hypothyroidism has been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib (see section 4.8). Thyroid 
function should be monitored before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with 
lenvatinib. Hypothyroidism should be treated according to standard medical practice to maintain 
euthyroid state. 
Lenvatinib impairs exogenous thyroid suppression (see section 4.8). Thyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH) levels should be monitored on a regular basis and thyroid hormone administration should be 
adjusted to reach appropriate TSH levels, according to the patient’s therapeutic target. 
Wound healing complications 
No formal studies of the effect of lenvatinib on wound healing have been conducted. Impaired wound 
healing has been reported in patients receiving lenvatinib. Temporary interruption of lenvatinib should 
be considered in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. There is limited clinical experience 
regarding the timing of reinitiation of lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure. Therefore, the 
decision to resume lenvatinib following a major surgical procedure should be based on clinical 
judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
Cases of ONJ have been reported in patients treated with lenvatinib. Some cases were reported in 
patients who had received prior or concomitant treatment with antiresorptive bone therapy, and/or 
other angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g. bevacizumab, TKI, mTOR inhibitors. Caution should therefore be 
exercised when lenvatinib is used either simultaneously or sequentially with antiresorptive therapy 
and/or other angiogenesis inhibitors. 
Invasive dental procedures are an identified risk factor. Prior to treatment with lenvatinib, a dental 
examination and appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered. In patients who have 
previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates, invasive dental procedures should 
be avoided if possible (see section 4.8). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Limited data are available for patients of ethnic origin other than Caucasian or Asian, and in patients 
aged ≥75 years. Lenvatinib should be used with caution in such patients, given the reduced tolerability 
of lenvatinib in Asian and elderly patients (see section 4.8).  
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib immediately following sorafenib or other anticancer 
treatments and there may be a potential risk for additive toxicities unless there is an adequate washout 
period between treatments. The minimal washout period in clinical trials was 4 weeks. 
Patients with ECOG PS ≥ 2 were excluded from clinical studies (except for thyroid carcinoma). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on lenvatinib 
Chemotherapeutic agents 
Concomitant administration of lenvatinib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has no significant impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of any of these 3 substances. 
Effect of lenvatinib on other medicinal products 
A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in the presence of lenvatinib. No 
significant drug-drug interaction is therefore expected between lenvatinib and other CYP3A4/Pgp 
substrates. 
Oral contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, 
and therefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see section 
4.6). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly effective 
contraception while on treatment with lenvatinib and for at least one month after finishing treatment. It 
is currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and 
therefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data on the use of lenvatinib in pregnant women. Lenvatinib was embryotoxic and 
teratogenic when administered to rats and rabbits (see section 5.3).  
Lenvatinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after a careful 
consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk to the foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether lenvatinib is excreted in human milk. Lenvatinib and its metabolites are 
excreted in rat milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns or infants cannot be excluded and, therefore, 
lenvatinib is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Effects in humans are unknown. However, testicular and ovarian toxicity has been observed in rats, 
dogs, and monkeys (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lenvatinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, due to undesirable effects 
such as fatigue and dizziness. Patients who experience these symptoms should use caution when 
driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
DTC 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (occurring in ≥30% of patients) are hypertension 
(68.6%), diarrhoea (62.8%), decreased appetite (51.5%), decreased weight (49.1%), fatigue (45.8%), 
nausea (44.5%), proteinuria 36.9%), stomatitis (35.8%), vomiting (34.5%), dysphonia (34.1%), 
headache (34.1%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPE) (32.7%). Hypertension 
and proteinuria tend to occur early during lenvatinib treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The majority 
of Grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions occurred during the first 6 months of treatment except for diarrhoea, 
which occurred throughout treatment, and weight loss, which tended to be cumulative over time. 
The most important serious adverse reactions were renal failure and impairment (2.4%), 
arterial thromboembolisms (3.9%), cardiac failure (0.7%), intracranial tumour haemorrhage (0.7%), 
PRES / RPLS (0.2%), hepatic failure (0.2%), and arterial thromboembolisms (cerebrovascular 
accident (1.1%), transient ischaemic attack (0.7%), and myocardial infarction (0.9%). 
In 452 patients with RAI-refractory DTC, dose reduction and discontinuation were the actions taken 
for an adverse reaction in 63.1% and 19.5% of patients, respectively. Adverse reactions that most 
commonly led to dose reductions (in ≥5% of patients) were hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhoea, 
fatigue, PPE, decreased weight, and decreased appetite. Adverse reactions that most commonly led to 
discontinuation of lenvatinib were proteinuria, asthenia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, 
diarrhoea, and pulmonary embolism. 
HCC 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (occurring in ≥30% of patients) are hypertension 
(44.0%), diarrhoea (38.1%), decreased appetite (34.9%), fatigue (30.6%), and decreased weight 
(30.4%). 
The most important serious adverse reactions were hepatic failure (2.8%), hepatic encephalopathy 
(4.6%), oesophageal varices haemorrhage (1.4%), cerebral haemorrhage (0.6%), arterial 
thromboembolic events (2.0%) including myocardial infarction (0.8%), cerebral infarction (0.4%) and 
cerebrovascular accident (0.4%) and renal failure/impairment events (1.4%). There was a higher 
incidence of decreased neutrophil count in patients with HCC (8.7% on lenvatinib than in other non- 
HCC tumour types (1.4%)), which was not associated with infection, sepsis or bacterial peritonitis. 
In 496 patients with HCC, dose modification (interruption or reduction) and discontinuation were the 
actions taken for an adverse reaction in 62.3% and 20.2% of patients, respectively. Adverse reactions 
that most commonly led to dose modifications (in ≥5% of patients) were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, 
proteinuria, hypertension, fatigue, PPE and decreased platelet count. Adverse reactions that most 
commonly led to discontinuation of lenvatinib were hepatic encephalopathy, fatigue, increased blood 
bilirubin, proteinuria and hepatic failure.

(27%), urinary tract infection (27%), dysphonia (25%), abdominal pain (23%), asthenia (23%), 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (23%), stomatitis (23%), anaemia (22%), and 
hypomagnesaemia (20%). 
The most common (occurring in ≥5% of patients) severe (Grade ≥3) adverse reactions were 
hypertension (37.2%), decreased weight (9.1%), diarrhoea (8.1%), increased lipase (7.7%), decreased 
appetite (6.4%), asthenia (6%), fatigue (6%), hypokalaemia (5.7%), anaemia (5.3%), and proteinuria 
(5.1%). 
Discontinuation of lenvatinib occurred in 30.6% of patients, and discontinuation of both lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab occurred in 15.3% of patients due to an adverse reaction. The most common 
(occurring in ≥1% of patients) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib were 
hypertension (1.9%), diarrhoea (1.3%), asthenia (1.3%), decreased appetite (1.3%), proteinuria (1.3%),

interruption of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34.3% of 
patients. The most common (occurring in ≥5% of patients) adverse reactions leading to interruption of 
lenvatinib were hypertension (12.6%), diarrhoea (11.5%), proteinuria (7.2%), vomiting (7%), fatigue 
(5.7%), and decreased appetite (5.7%). 
Dose reduction of lenvatinib due to adverse reactions occurred in 67.0% of patients. The  most 
common (occurring in ≥5% of patients) adverse reactions resulting in dose reduction of lenvatinib 
were hypertension (16.2%), diarrhoea (12.5%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (9.1%), 
fatigue (8.7%), proteinuria (7.7%), decreased appetite (6.6%), nausea (5.5%), asthenia (5.1%), and 
decreased weight (5.1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile of lenvatinib as monotherapy is based on data from 452 DTC patients and 496 HCC 
patients; allowing characterisation only of common adverse drug reactions in DTC and HCC patients. 
The adverse reactions presented in this section are based on safety data of both DTC and HCC patients 
(see section 5.1). 
The safety profile of lenvatinib as combination therapy is based on data from 530 EC patients treated 
with lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab (see section 5.1). 
Adverse reactions observed in clinical trials in DTC, HCC, and EC, and reported from post-marketing 
use of lenvatinib are listed in Table 6. The adverse reaction frequency category represents the most 
conservative estimate of frequency from the individual populations. Adverse reactions known to occur 
with lenvatinib or combination therapy components given alone may occur during treatment with 
these medicinal products in combination, even if these reactions were not reported in clinical studies 
with combination therapy.  
For additional safety information when lenvatinib is administered in combination, refer to the SmPC 
for the respective combination therapy component (pembrolizumab).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypertension (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), hypertension (including hypertension, 
hypertensive crisis, increased diastolic blood pressure, and increased blood pressure) was reported in 
72.8% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 16.0% of patients in the placebo-treated group. The median 
time to onset in lenvatinib-treated patients was 16 days. Reactions of Grade 3 or higher (including 
1 reaction of Grade 4) occurred in 44.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients compared with 3.8% of 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo-treated patients. The majority of cases recovered or resolved following dose interruption or 
reduction, which occurred in 13.0% and 13.4% of patients, respectively. In 1.1% of patients, 
hypertension led to permanent treatment discontinuation.

In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), hypertension (including hypertension, increased blood 
pressure, increased diastolic blood pressure and orthostatic hypertension) was reported in 44.5% of 
lenvatinib-treated patients and Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 23.5%. The median time to onset was 
26 days. The majority of cases recovered following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 
3.6% and 3.4% of patients, respectively. One subject (0.2%) discontinued lenvatinib due to 
hypertension. 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), hypertension was reported in 65% of patients in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group. Reactions of Grade 3 or higher occurred in 38.4% of patients in 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab group. The median time to onset in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab group was 15 days. Dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation of lenvatinib

Proteinuria (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), proteinuria was reported in 33.7% of lenvatinib-
treated patients and 3.1% of patients in the placebo-treated group. The median time to onset was 
6.7 weeks. Grade 3 reactions occurred in 10.7% of lenvatinib-treated patients and none in placebo-
treated patients. The majority of cases had an outcome of recovered or resolved following dose 
interruption or reduction, which occurred in 16.9% and 10.7% of patients, respectively. Proteinuria led 
to permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.8% of patients. 
HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), proteinuria was reported in 26.3% of lenvatinib-
treated patients and Grade 3 reactions occurred in 5.9%. The median time to onset was 6.1 weeks. The 
majority of cases recovered following dose interruption or reduction, which occurred in 6.9% and 
2.5% of patients, respectively. Proteinuria led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.6% of 
patients. 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), proteinuria was reported in 29.6% of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab-treated patients and Grade ≥3 reactions occurred in 5.4% of patients. The median time 
to onset was 34.5 days. Dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation of lenvatinib occurred in 
6.2%, 7.9% and 1.2% of patients, respectively.  
Renal failure and impairment (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), 5.0% of patients developed renal failure and 
1.9% developed renal impairment (3.1% of patients had a Grade ≥ 3 event of renal failure or 
impairment). In the placebo group 0.8% of patients developed renal failure or impairment (0.8% were 
Grade ≥ 3). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), 7.1% of lenvatinib-treated patients developed a renal 
failure/impairment event. Grade 3 or greater reactions occurred in 1.9% of lenvatinib-treated patients. 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), 18.2% of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab-treated patients 
developed a renal failure/impairment event. Grade ≥ 3 reactions occurred in 4.2% of patients. The 
median time to onset was 86.0 days. Dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation of lenvatinib 
occurred in 3.0%, 1.7% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. 
Cardiac dysfunction (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), decreased ejection fraction/cardiac failure was 
reported in 6.5% of patients (1.5% were Grade ≥ 3) in the lenvatinib treated group, and 2.3% in the 
placebo group (none were Grade ≥ 3). 
HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), cardiac dysfunction (including congestive cardiac 
failure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiopulmonary failure) was reported in 0.6% of patients (0.4% were 
Grade ≥ 3) in the lenvatinib-treated group. 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), cardiac dysfunction was reported in 1.0% of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab-treated patients and Grade ≥3 reactions occurred in 0.5% of patients. The median time 
to onset was 112.0 days. Dose reduction and discontinuation of lenvatinib both occurred in 0.2% of 
patients.  
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) / Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS) (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), there was 1 event of PRES (Grade 2) in the 
lenvatinib-treated group and no reports in the placebo group. 
HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), there was 1 event of PRES (Grade 2) in the 
lenvatinib-treated group. 
Amongst 1,823 patients treated with lenvatinib monotherapy in clinical trials, there were 5 cases 
(0.3%) of PRES (0.2% were Grade 3 or 4), all of which resolved after treatment and/or dose 
interruption, or permanent discontinuation. 
EC  
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), there was one event of PRES (Grade 1) in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab-treated group for which lenvatinib was interrupted.

Hepatotoxicity (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), the most commonly reported liver-related 
adverse reactions were hypoalbuminaemia (9.6% lenvatinib vs. 1.5% placebo) and elevations of liver 
enzyme levels, including increases in alanine aminotransferase (7.7% lenvatinib vs. 0 placebo), 
aspartate aminotransferase (6.9% lenvatinib vs. 1.5% placebo), and blood bilirubin (1.9% lenvatinib 
vs. 0 placebo). The median time to onset of liver reactions in lenvatinib-treated patients was 
12.1 weeks. Liver-related reactions of Grade 3 or higher (including 1 Grade 5 case of hepatic failure) 
occurred in 5.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients compared with 0.8% in placebo-treated patients. Liver-
related reactions led to dose interruptions and reductions in 4.6% and 2.7% of patients, respectively, 
and to permanent discontinuation in 0.4%. 
Amongst 1,166 patients treated with lenvatinib, there were 3 cases (0.3%) of hepatic failure, all with a  
fatal outcome. One occurred in a patient with no liver metastases. There was also a case of acute 
hepatitis in a patient without liver metastases. 
HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), the most commonly reported hepatotoxicity adverse 
reactions were increased blood bilirubin (14.9%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (13.7%), 
increased alanine aminotransferase (11.1%), hypoalbuminaemia (9.2%), hepatic encephalopathy 
(8.0%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (7.8%) and increased blood alkaline phosphatase 
(6.7%). The median time to onset of hepatotoxocity adverse reactions was 6.4 weeks. Hepatotoxicity 
reactions of ≥ Grade 3 occurred in 26.1% of lenvatinib-treated patients. Hepatic failure (including fatal 
events in 12 patients) occurred in 3.6% of patients (all were ≥ Grade 3). Hepatic encephalopathy 
(including fatal events in 4 patients) occurred in 8.4% of patients (5.5% were ≥ Grade 3). There were 
17 (3.6%) deaths due to hepatotoxicity events in the lenvatinib arm and 4 (0.8%) deaths in the 
sorafenib arm. Hepatotoxicity adverse reactions led to dose interruptions and reductions in 12.2% and 
7.4% of lenvatinib-treated patients respectively, and to permanent discontinuation in 5.5%. 
Across clinical trials in which 1327 patients received lenvatinib monotherapy in indications other than 
HCC, hepatic failure (including fatal events) was reported in 4 patients (0.3%), liver injury in 
2 patients (0.2%), acute hepatitis in 2 patients (0.2%), and hepatocellular injury in 1 patient (0.1%). 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), hepatotoxicity was reported in 33.7% of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab-treated patients and Grade ≥3 reactions occurred in 12.1% of patients. The median 
time to onset was 56.0 days. Dose interruption, reduction and discontinuation of lenvatinib occurred in 
5.2%, 3.0% and 1.2% of patients, respectively.  
Arterial thromboembolisms (see section 4.4)

of fatal intracranial haemorrhage among 16 patients who received lenvatinib and had CNS metastases 
at baseline. 
The median time to first onset in lenvatinib-treated patients was 10.1 weeks. No differences between 
lenvatinib- and placebo-treated patients were observed in the incidences of serious reactions (3.4% vs. 
3.8%), reactions leading to premature discontinuation (1.1% vs. 1.5%), or reactions leading to dose 
interruption (3.4% vs. 3.8%) or reduction (0.4% vs. 0).

(1.5%) had a grade 5 reaction including cerebral haemorrhage, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
intestinal haemorrhage and tumour haemorrhage. The median time to first onset was 11.9 weeks. A 
haemorrhage event led to dose interruption or reduction in 3.2% and 0.8% patients respectively and to 
treatment discontinuation in 1.7% of patients. 
Across clinical trials in which 1,327 patients received lenvatinib monotherapy in indications other than 
HCC, Grade ≥ 3 or greater haemorrhage was reported in 2% of patients, 3 patients (0.2%) had a 
Grade 4 haemorrhage and 8 patients (0.6%) had a Grade 5 reaction including arterial haemorrhage,

respectively. 
Non-gastrointestinal fistulae (see section 4.4) 
Lenvatinib use has been associated with cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in death. 
Reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than stomach or intestines were observed 
across various indications. Reactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging 
from two weeks to greater than 1 year from initiation of lenvatinib, with median latency of about 
3 months.

The median time to onset was 115.5 days. Dose interruption and reduction of lenvatinib occurred in 
0.2% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. 
Increased blood thyroid stimulating hormone (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), 88% of all patients had a baseline TSH level 
less than or equal to 0.5 mU/L. In those patients with a normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level 
above 0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of lenvatinib-treated patients as compared with 
14% of placebo-treated patients. 
HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), 89.6% of patients had a baseline TSH level of less 
than the upper limit of normal. Elevation of TSH above the upper limit of normal was observed post 
baseline in 69.6% of lenvatinib-treated patients. 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), hypothyroidism was reported in 68.2% of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab-treated patients and Grade ≥3 reactions occurred in 1.2% of patients. The median time 
to onset was 62.0 days. Dose interruption and reduction of lenvatinib occurred in 2.2% and 0.7% of 
patients, respectively.  
Blood TSH increased was reported in 12.8% of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab-treated patients with 
no patients reporting Grade ≥3 reactions. Dose interruption occurred in 0.2% of patients.  
Diarrhoea (see section 4.4) 
DTC 
In the pivotal Phase 3 SELECT trial (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was reported in 67.4% of patients in 
the lenvatinib-treated group (9.2% were Grade ≥ 3) and in 16.8% of patients in the placebo group 
(none were Grade ≥ 3).

HCC 
In the Phase 3 REFLECT trial (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was reported in 38.7% of patients treated 
with lenvatinib (4.2% were Grade ≥ 3). 
EC 
In the Phase 3 Study 309 (see section 5.1), diarrhoea was reported in 54.2% of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab-treated patients (7.6% were Grade ≥ 3). Dose interruption, reduction and 
discontinuation of lenvatinib occurred in 10.6%, 11.1% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. 
Paediatric population  
In the paediatric Studies 207 and 230 (see section 5.1), the overall safety profile of lenvatinib as a 
single agent or in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide was consistent with that observed in 
adults treated with lenvatinib. In patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma, pneumothorax was 
reported at a frequency higher than that observed in adults with DTC, HCC, RCC and EC. In Study 
207, pneumothorax occurred in 6 patients (10.9%) treated with single -agent lenvatinib and 7 patients 
(16.7%) treated with lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide. Overall, 2 patients 
discontinued study treatment due to pneumothorax. In Study 230, pneumothorax was reported in 12 
patients (11 patients [28.2%] treated with lenvatinib plus ifosfamide and etoposide, and 1 patient 
[2.6%] treated with ifosfamide and etoposide). No patient discontinued study treatment due to 
pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurrence appeared to be mainly associated with pulmonary 
metastases and underlying disease. 
In the single-agent dose-finding cohort of Study 207, the most frequently (≥40%) reported adverse 
drug reactions were decreased appetite, diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, vomiting, abdominal pain, pyrexia, 
hypertension, and weight decreased; and in the single-agent expansion cohort of patients with relapsed 
or refractory osteosarcoma, the most frequently (≥40%) reported adverse drug reactions were 
decreased appetite, headache, vomiting, hypothyroidism, and proteinuria. 
In the combination dose-finding cohort of Study 207, the most frequently (≥50%) reported adverse 
drug reactions were vomiting, anaemia, nausea, diarrhoea, hypothyroidism, abdominal pain, arthralgia, 
epistaxis, neutropenia, constipation, headache, and pain in extremity; and in the combination 
expansion cohort, the most frequently (≥50%) reported adverse drug reactions were anaemia, nausea, 
white blood cell count decreased, diarrhoea, vomiting, and platelet count decreased. 
In the OLIE study (Study 230), the most frequently (≥35%) reported adverse drug reactions were 
hypothyroidism, anaemia, nausea, platelet count decreased, proteinuria, vomiting, back pain, febrile 
neutropenia, hypertension, constipation, diarrhoea, neutrophil count decreased, and pyrexia.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest doses of lenvatinib studied clinically were 32 mg and 40 mg per day. Accidental 
medication errors resulting in single doses of 40 to 48 mg have occurred in clinical trials. The most 
frequently observed adverse drug reactions at these doses were hypertension, nausea, diarrhoea, 
fatigue, stomatitis, proteinuria, headache, and aggravation of PPE. There have also been reports of 
overdose with lenvatinib involving single administrations of 6 to 10 times the recommended daily 
dose. These cases were associated with adverse reactions consistent with the known safety profile of 
lenvatinib (i.e., renal and cardiac failure), or were without adverse reactions.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX08 
Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor which has shown mainly antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in 
vivo, and direct inhibition of tumour growth was also observed in in vitro models. 
Mechanism of action 
Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and 
VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor 
(PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET. 
In addition, lenvatinib had selective, direct antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular cell lines 
dependent on activated FGFR signalling, which is attributed to the inhibition of FGFR signalling by 
lenvatinib. 
In syngeneic mouse tumour models, lenvatinib decreased tumour-associated macrophages, increased 
activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumour activity in combination with an anti-
PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. 
Although not studied directly with lenvatinib, the mechanism of action (MOA) for hypertension is 
postulated to be mediated by the inhibition of VEGFR2 in vascular endothelial cells. Similarly, 
although not studied directly, the MOA for proteinuria is postulated to be mediated by downregulation 
of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in the podocytes of the glomerulus. 
The mechanism of action for hypothyroidism is not fully elucidated. 
Clinical efficacy 
Radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer 
The SELECT study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was 
conducted in 392 patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer with independent, 
centrally reviewed, radiographic evidence of disease progression within 12 months (+1 month 
window) prior to enrolment. Radioiodine-refractory was defined as one or more measurable lesions 
either with a lack of iodine uptake or with progression in spite of radioactive-iodine (RAI) therapy, or 
having a cumulative activity of RAI of >600 mCi or 22 GBq with the last dose at least 6 months prior 
to study entry. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region (Europe, North America, and 
Other), prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy (patients may have received 0 or 1 prior 
VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy), and age (≤65 years or >65 years). The main efficacy outcome 
measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by blinded independent radiologic review 
using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1. Secondary efficacy outcome 
measures included overall response rate and overall survival. Patients in the placebo arm could opt to 
receive lenvatinib treatment at the time of confirmed disease progression. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eligible patients with measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 were randomised 2:1 to receive 
lenvatinib 24 mg once daily (n=261) or placebo (n=131). Baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics were well balanced for both treatment groups. Of the 392 patients randomised, 76.3% 
were naïve to prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies, 49.0% were female, 49.7% were European, and 
the median age was 63 years. Histologically, 66.1% had a confirmed diagnosis of papillary thyroid 
cancer and 33.9% had follicular thyroid cancer which included Hürthle cell 14.8% and clear cell 3.8%. 
Metastases were present in 99% of the patients: lungs in 89.3%, lymph nodes in 51.5%, bone in 
38.8%, liver in 18.1%, pleura in 16.3%, and brain in 4.1%. The majority of patients had an ECOG 
performance status of 0; 42.1% had a status of 1; 3.9% had a status above 1. The median cumulative 
RAI activity administered prior to study entry was 350 mCi (12.95 GBq). 
A statistically significant prolongation in PFS was demonstrated in lenvatinib-treated patients 
compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.0001) (see figure 1). The positive effect on PFS was seen 
across the subgroups of age (above or below 65 years), sex, race, histological subtype, geographic 
region, and those who received 0 or 1 prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies. Following independent 
review confirmation of disease progression, 109 (83.2%) patients randomised to placebo had crossed 
over to open-label lenvatinib at the time of the primary efficacy analysis. 
The objective response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) per independent 
radiological review was significantly (p<0.0001) higher in the lenvatinib-treated group (64.8%) than in 
the placebo-treated group (1.5%). Four (1.5%) subjects treated with lenvatinib attained a CR and 165 
subjects (63.2%) had a PR, while no subjects treated with placebo had a CR and 2 (1.5%) subjects had 
a PR. 
The median time to first dose reduction was 2.8 months. The median time to objective responsive was 
2.0 (95% CI: 1.9, 3.5) months; however, of the patients who experienced a complete or partial 
response to lenvatinib, 70.4% were observed to develop the response on or within 30 days of being on 
the 24-mg dose. 
The overall survival analysis was confounded by the fact that placebo-treated subjects with confirmed 
disease progression had the option to cross over to open-label lenvatinib. There was no statistically 
significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups at the time of the primary 
efficacy analysis (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.07, p=0.1032). The median Overall Survival (OS) had 
not been reached for either the lenvatinib group or the placebo crossover group.

Hepatocellular carcinoma 
The clinical efficacy and safety of lenvatinib have been evaluated in an international, multicenter, 
open-label, randomised phase 3 study (REFLECT) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). 
In total, 954 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either lenvatinib (12 mg [baseline body weight 
≥60 kg] or 8 mg [baseline body weight <60 kg]) given orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg given 
orally twice daily. 
Patients were eligible to participate if they had a liver function status of Child-Pugh class A and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1. Patients were excluded 
who had prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced/unresectable HCC or any prior anti-VEGF 
therapy. Target lesions previously treated with radiotherapy or locoregional therapy had to show 
radiographic evidence of disease progression. Patients with ≥50% liver occupation, clear invasion into 
the bile duct or a main branch of the portal vein (Vp4) on imaging were also excluded.

The primary efficacy endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). Lenvatinib was non-inferior for OS to 
sorafenib with HR = 0.92 [95% CI of (0.79, 1.06)] and a median OS of 13.6 months vs 12.3 months 
(see Table 8 and Figure 2). The results for surrogate endpoints (PFS and ORR) are presented in Table

Hazard ratio (HR) is for lenvatinib vs. sorafenib, based on a Cox model including treatment 
group as a factor. 
Stratified by region (Region 1: Asia-Pacific; Region 2: Western), macroscopic portal vein 
invasion or extrahepatic spread or both (yes, no), ECOG PS (0, 1) and body weight (<60 kg, 
≥60 kg). 
Results are based on confirmed and unconfirmed responses. 
P- value is for the superiority test of lenvatinib versus sorafenib. 
Quartiles are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the 95% CIs are estimated with a 
generalised Brookmeyer and Crowley method 
Response rate (complete or partial response) 
Per independent radiology review retrospective analysis. The median duration of objective 
response was 7.3 (95% CI 5.6, 7.4) months in the lenvatinib arm and 6.2 (95% CI 3.7, 11.2) 
months in the sorafenib arm.

Noninferiority margin for hazard ratio (HR: lenvatinib vs sorafenib = 1.08). 
Median was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and the 95% confidence interval was constructed

HR was estimated from the Cox proportional hazard model with treatment as independent variable and 
stratified by IxRS stratification factors. The Efron method was used for ties. 
+ = censored observations. 
In subgroup analyses by stratification factors (presence or absence of MPVI or EHS or both, ECOG 
PS 0 or 1, BW <60 kg or ≥60 kg and region) the HR consistently favoured lenvatinib over sorafenib, 
with the exception of Western region [HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.82, 1.42], patients without EHS [HR of 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.01 (95% CI 0.78, 1.30)] and patients without MPVI, EHS or both [HR of 1.05 (0.79, 1.40)]. The 
results of subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. 
The median duration of treatment was 5.7 months (Q1: 2.9, Q3: 11.1) in the lenvatinib arm and 
3.7 months (Q1: 1.8, Q3: 7.4) in the sorafenib arm. 
In both treatment arms in the REFLECT study, median OS was approximately 9 months longer in 
subjects who received post-treatment anticancer therapy than in those who did not. In the lenvatinib 
arm, median OS was 19.5 months (95% CI: 15.7, 23.0) for subjects who received post-treatment 
anticancer therapy (43%) and 10.5 months (95% CI: 8.6, 12.2) for those who did not. In the sorafenib 
arm, median OS was 17.0 months (95% CI: 14.2, 18.8) for subjects who received posttreatment 
anticancer therapy (51%) and 7.9 months (95% CI: 6.6, 9.7) for those who did not. Median OS was 
longer by approximately 2.5 months in the lenvatinib compared with the sorafenib arm in both subsets 
of subjects (with or without post-treatment anticancer therapy). 
Endometrial carcinoma 
The efficacy of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in Study 309, a 
randomised, multicentre, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in patients with advanced EC  
who had been previously treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in any 
setting, including in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Participants may have received up to 2 
platinum-containing therapies in total, as long as one was given in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
treatment setting. The study excluded patients with endometrial sarcoma (including carcinosarcoma), 
or patients who had active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required 
immunosuppression. Randomisation was stratified by mismatch repair (MMR) status (dMMR or 
pMMR [not dMMR]) using a validated IHC test. The pMMR stratum was further stratified by ECOG 
performance status, geographic region, and history of pelvic radiation. Patients were randomised (1:1) 
to one of the following treatment arms: 
• 
• 
lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg 
intravenously every 3 weeks. 
investigator’s choice consisting of either doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, or 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 given weekly, 3 weeks on/1 week off. 
Treatment with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of 
disease as verified by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), unacceptable toxicity, or for 
pembrolizumab, a maximum of 24 months. Administration of study treatment was permitted beyond 
RECIST-defined disease progression if the treating investigator considered the patient to be deriving 
clinical benefit and the treatment was tolerated. A total of 121/411 (29%) of the lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab-treated patients received continued study therapy beyond RECIST-defined disease 
progression. The median duration of post-progression therapy was 2.8 months. Assessment of tumour 
status was performed every 8 weeks. 
A total of 827 patients were enrolled and randomised to lenvatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab (n=411) or investigator’s choice of doxorubicin (n=306) or paclitaxel (n=110). The 
baseline characteristics of these patients were: median age of 65 years (range 30 to 86), 50% age 65 or 
older; 61% White, 21% Asian, and 4% Black; ECOG PS of 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), and 84% with pMMR 
tumour status, and 16% with dMMR tumour status. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid 
carcinoma (60%), serous (26%), clear cell carcinoma (6%), mixed (5%), and other (3%). All 827 of 
these patients received prior systemic therapy for EC: 69% had one, 28% had two, and 3% had three 
or more prior systemic therapies. Thirty-seven percent of patients received only prior neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant therapy. 
The median duration of study treatment was 7.6 months (range 1 day to 26.8 months). The median 
duration of exposure to lenvatinib was 6.9 months (range 1 day to 26.8 months). 
The primary efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1). 
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. At the 
pre-specified interim analysis, with a median follow-up time of 11.4 months (range: 0.3 to 26.9 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months), the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS in the all-
comer population.  
Efficacy results by MMR subgroups were consistent with overall study results. 
The pre-specified final OS analysis with approximately 16 months of additional follow-up duration 
from the interim analysis (overall median follow-up time of 14.7 months [range: 0.3 to 43.0 months]) 
was performed without multiplicity adjustment. The efficacy results in the all-comer population are 
summarised in Table 9. Kaplan-Meier curves for final OS and interim PFS analyses are shown in 
Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

QT interval prolongation 
A single 32-mg dose of lenvatinib did not prolong the QT/QTc interval based on results from a 
thorough QT study in healthy volunteers; however, QT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported at 
a higher incidence in patients treated with lenvatinib than in patients treated with placebo (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
lenvatinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of  hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) and endometrial carcinoma (EC) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric studies 
The efficacy of lenvatinib was assessed but not established in two open-label studies: 
Study 207 was a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-centre, dose-finding and activity-estimating study of 
lenvatinib as a single agent and in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in paediatric patients 
(aged 2 to <18 years; 2 to ≤25 years for osteosarcoma), with relapsed or refractory solid tumours. A 
total of 97 patients were enrolled. In the lenvatinib single agent dose-finding cohort, 23 patients were 
enrolled and received lenvatinib orally, once daily, across 3 dose levels (11, 14, or 17 mg/m2). In the 
lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide dose-finding cohort, a total of 22 patients 
were enrolled and received lenvatinib across 2 dose levels (11 or 14 mg/m2). The recommended dose 
(RD) of lenvatinib as a single agent, and in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide was 
determined as 14 mg/m2 orally, once daily. 
In the lenvatinib single agent expansion cohort of relapsed or refractory DTC, the primary efficacy 
outcome measure was objective response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). 
One patient was enrolled, and this patient achieved a PR. In both the lenvatinib single agent, and 
combination with ifosfamide and etoposide expansion cohorts of relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, 
the primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival rate at 4 months (PFS-4); the 
PFS-4 by binomial estimate including all 31 patients treated with lenvatinib as a single agent was 29% 
(95%CI: 14.2, 48.0); the PFS-4 by binomial estimate in all 20 patients treated in the lenvatinib in 
combination with ifosfamide and etoposide expansion cohort was 50% (95%CI: 27.2, 72.8). 
The OLIE study (Study 230) was a Phase 2, open-label, multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial in 
patients (aged 2 to ≤25 years) with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. A total of 81 patients were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio (78 treated; 39 in each arm) to lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 in combination with 
ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 (Arm A) or ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2 and etoposide 
100 mg/m2 (Arm B). Ifosfamide and etoposide were administered intravenously on Days 1 to 3 of each 
21-day cycle for a maximum of 5 cycles. Treatment with lenvatinib was permitted until RECIST v1.1-
defined disease progression as verified by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) or 
unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) per 
RECIST 1.1 by BICR. The trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in median 
PFS: 6.5 months (95%CI: 5.7, 8.2) for lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus 
5.5 months (95%CI: 2.9, 6.5) for ifosfamide and etoposide (HR=0.54 [95%CI: 0.27, 1.08]). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  lenvatinib  have  been  studied  in  healthy  adult  subjects,  adult  subjects 
with hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and solid tumours. 
Absorption 
Lenvatinib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with tmax typically observed from 1 to 4 hours 
postdose.  Food  does  not  affect  the  extent  of  absorption,  but  slows  the  rate  of  absorption.  When 
administered with food to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations are delayed by 2 hours. Absolute 
bioavailability has not been determined in humans; however, data from a mass-balance study suggest 
that  it  is  in  the  order  of  85%.  Lenvatinib  exhibited  good  oral  bioavailability  in  dogs  (70.4%)  and 
monkeys (78.4%). 
Distribution 
In vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins is high and ranged from 98% to 99% 
(0.3 - 30 μg/mL, mesilate). This binding was mainly to albumin with minor binding to α1-acid 
glycoprotein and γ-globulin. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro, the lenvatinib blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.589 to 0.608 
(0.1 – 10 μg/mL, mesilate). 
Lenvatinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Lenvatinib is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K or the bile salt export pump BSEP. 
In patients, the median apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of the first dose ranged from 50.5 L to 
92 L and was generally consistent across the dose groups from 3.2 mg to 32 mg. The analogous 
median apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vz/Fss) was also generally consistent and 
ranged from 43.2 L to 121 L. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro, cytochrome P450 3A4 was demonstrated as the predominant (>80%) isoform involved in the 
P450-mediated metabolism of lenvatinib. However, in vivo data indicated that non-P450-mediated 
pathways contributed to a significant portion of the overall metabolism of lenvatinib. Consequently, in 
vivo, inducers and inhibitors of CYP 3A4 had a minimal effect on lenvatinib exposure (see 
section 4.5). 
In human liver microsomes, the demethylated form of lenvatinib (M2) was identified as the main 
metabolite. M2’ and M3’, the major metabolites in human faeces, were formed from M2 and 
lenvatinib, respectively, by aldehyde oxidase. 
In plasma samples collected up to 24 hours after administration, lenvatinib constituted 97% of the 
radioactivity in plasma radiochromatograms while the M2 metabolite accounted for an additional 
2.5%. Based on AUC(0 – inf), lenvatinib accounted for 60% and 64% of the total radioactivity in plasma 
and blood, respectively. 
Data from a human mass balance/excretion study indicate lenvatinib is extensively metabolised in 
humans. The main metabolic pathways in humans were identified as oxidation by aldehyde oxidase, 
demethylation via CYP3A4, glutathione conjugation with elimination of the O-aryl group 
(chlorophenyl moiety), and combinations of these pathways followed by further biotransformations 
(e.g., glucuronidation, hydrolysis of the glutathione moiety, degradation of the cysteine moiety, and 
intramolecular rearrangement of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates with subsequent 
dimerisation). These in vivo  metabolic routes align with the data provided in the in vitro studies using 
human biomaterials. 
In vitro transporter studies 
For the following transporters, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, and BSEP, clinically relevant 
inhibition was excluded based on a cutoff of IC50> 50 × Cmax,unbound. 
Lenvatinib showed minimal or no inhibitory activities toward P-gp-mediated and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP)-mediated transport activities. Similarly, no induction of P-gp mRNA 
expression was observed . 
Lenvatinib showed minimal or no inhibitory effect on OATP1B3 and MATE2-K. Lenvatinib weakly 
inhibits MATE1. In human liver cytosol, lenvatinib did not inhibit aldehyde oxidase activity. 
Elimination 
Plasma concentrations decline bi-exponentially following Cmax. The mean terminal exponential half-
life of lenvatinib is approximately 28 hours. 
Following administration of radiolabelled lenvatinib to 6 patients with solid tumours, approximately 
two-thirds and one-quarter of the radiolabel were eliminated in the faeces and urine, respectively. The 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
M3 metabolite was the predominant analyte in excreta (~17% of the dose), followed by M2’ (~11% of 
the dose) and M2 (~4.4 of the dose). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Dose proportionality and accumulation 
In patients with solid tumours administered single and multiple doses of lenvatinib once daily, 
exposure to lenvatinib (Cmax and AUC) increased in direct proportion to the administered dose over the 
range of 3.2 to 32 mg once-daily.  
Lenvatinib displays minimimal accumulation at steady state. Over this range, the median accumulation 
index (Rac) ranged from 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). The Rac in HCC subjects with mild and 
moderate liver impairment was similar to that reported for other solid tumours. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10-mg dose were evaluated in 6 subjects each 
with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B, respectively). A 5-mg 
dose was evaluated in 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Eight healthy, 
demographically matched subjects served as controls and received a 10-mg dose. Lenvatinib exposure, 
based on dose-adjusted AUC0-t and AUC0-inf data, was 119%, 107%, and 180% of normal for subjects 
with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. It has been determined that plasma 
protein binding in plasma from hepatically impaired subjects was similar to the respective matched 
healthy subjects and no concentration dependency was observed. See section 4.2 for dosing 
recommendation. 
There are not sufficient data for HCC patients with Child-Pugh B (moderate hepatic impairment, 3 
patients treated with lenvatinib in the pivotal trial) and no data available in Child-Pugh C HCC 
patients (severe hepatic impairment). Lenvatinib is mainly eliminated via the liver and exposure might 
be increased in these patient populations. 
The median half-life was comparable in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment 
as well as those with normal hepatic function and ranged from 26 hours to 31 hours. The percentage of 
the dose of lenvatinib excreted in urine was low in all cohorts (<2.16% across treatment cohorts). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 24-mg dose were evaluated in 6 subjects each 
with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and compared with 8 healthy, demographically 
matched subjects. Subjects with end-stage renal disease were not studied.  
Lenvatinib exposure, based on AUC0-inf data, was 101%, 90%, and 122% of normal for subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. It has been determined that plasma protein 
binding in plasma from renally impaired subjects was similar to the respective matched healthy 
subjects and no concentration dependency was observed. See section 4.2 for dosing recommendation. 
Age, sex, weight, race 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving up to 24 mg lenvatinib once 
daily, age, sex, weight, and race (Japanese vs. other, Caucasian vs. other) had no clinically relevant 
effects on clearance (see section 4.2). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric Population 
Based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis on pooled data from 1100 paediatric, adolescent and 
adult subjects, which included data from 3 paediatric patients aged 2 to <3 years, 28 paediatric patients 
aged ≥3 to <6 years and 89 paediatric patients aged 6 to ≤12 years across the lenvatinib paediatric 
program, lenvatinib oral clearance (CL/F) was affected by body weight but not age. Predicted 
exposure levels in terms of area under the curve at steady-state (AUCss) in paediatric patients 
receiving 14 mg/m2  were comparable to those in adult patients receiving a fixed dose of 24 mg. In 
these studies, there were no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of active substance 
lenvatinib among children (2 – 12 years), adolescents, and young adult patients with studied tumour 
types, but data in children are relatively limited to draw definite conclusions (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In the repeated-dose toxicity studies (up to 39 weeks), lenvatinib caused toxicologic changes in 
various organs and tissues related to the expected pharmacologic effects of lenvatinib including 
glomerulopathy, testicular hypocellularity, ovarian follicular atresia, gastrointestinal changes, bone 
changes, changes to the adrenals (rats and dogs), and arterial (arterial fibrinoid necrosis, medial 
degeneration, or haemorrhage) lesions in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Elevated transaminase 
levels asociated with signs of hepatotoxicity, were also observed in rats, dogs and monkeys. 
Reversibility of the toxicologic changes was observed at the end of a 4-week recovery period in all 
animal species investigated. 
Genotoxicity 
Lenvatinib was not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lenvatinib. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. 
However, testicular (hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium) and ovarian changes (follicular 
atresia) were observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies in animals at exposures 11 to 15 times (rat) or 
0.6 to 7 times (monkey) the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC) at the maximum tolerated 
human dose. These findings were reversible at the end of a 4-week recovery period. 
Administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and teratogenicity in 
rats (foetal external and skeletal anomalies) at exposures below the clinical exposure (based on AUC) 
at the maximum tolerated human dose, and rabbits (foetal external, visceral or skeletal anomalies) 
based on body surface area; mg/m2 at the maximum tolerated human dose. These findings indicate that 
lenvatinib has a teratogenic potential, likely related to the pharmacologic activity of lenvatinib as an 
antiangiogenic agent. 
Lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.  
Juvenile animal toxicity studies 
Mortality was the dose-limiting toxicity in juvenile rats in which dosing was initiated on postnatal day 
(PND) 7 or PND21 and was observed at exposures that were respectively 125- or 12-fold lower 
compared with the exposure at which mortality was observed in adult rats, suggesting an increasing 
sensitivity to toxicity with decreasing age. Therefore, mortality may be attributed to complications 
related to primary duodenal lesions with possible contribution from additional toxicities in immature 
target organs. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The toxicity of lenvatinib was more prominent in younger rats (dosing initiated on PND7) compared 
with those with dosing initiated on PND21 and mortality and some toxicities were observed earlier in 
the juvenile rats at 10 mg/kg compared with adult rats administered the same dose level. Growth 
retardation, secondary delay of physical development, and lesions attributable to pharmacologic 
effects (incisors, femur [epiphyseal growth plate], kidneys, adrenals, and duodenum) were also 
observed in juvenile rats.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What LENVIMA is and what it is used for 
What LENVIMA is 
LENVIMA is a medicine that contains the active substance lenvatinib. It is used on its own to treat 
progressive or advanced thyroid cancer in adults when radioactive iodine treatment has not helped to 
stop the disease. 
LENVIMA can also be used on its own to treat liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) in adults who 
have not previously been treated with another anticancer medicine that travels through the 
bloodstream. People get LENVIMA when their liver cancer has spread or cannot be taken out by 
surgery. 
LENVIMA can also be used together with another anticancer medicine called pembrolizumab to treat 
advanced cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial carcinoma) in adults whose cancer has spread 
after being previously treated with another anticancer medicine that travels through the bloodstream 
and cannot be taken out by surgery or radiation treatment.   
How LENVIMA works 
LENVIMA blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved 
in the development of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to cells and help them to 
grow. These proteins can be present in high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action 
LENVIMA may slow the rate at which the cancer cells multiply and the tumour grows and help to cut 
off the blood supply that the cancer needs. 
2.  What you need to know before you take LENVIMA 
Do not take LENVIMA if: 
• 
you are allergic to lenvatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
you are breast-feeding (see the section below on Contraception, pregnancy and breast-feeding). 
• 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking LENVIMA if you: 
• 
• 
have high blood pressure  
are a woman able to become pregnant (see the section below on Contraception, pregnancy and 
breast-feeding) 
have a history of heart problems or stroke 
have liver or kidney problems 
have had recent surgery or radiotherapy 
need to have a surgical procedure. Your doctor may consider stopping LENVIMA if you will be 
undergoing a major surgical procedure as LENVIMA may affect wound healing. LENVIMA 
may be restarted once adequate wound healing is established.  
are over 75 years  
belong to an ethnic group other than White or Asian  
weigh less than 60 kg 
have a history of abnormal connections (known as a fistula) between different organs in the 
body or from an organ to the skin  
If you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall. 
have or have had pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, 
numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth.  You may be advised to 
have a dental check-up before starting LENVIMA as bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis) 
has been reported in patients treated with LENVIMA.  If you need to undergo an invasive dental 
treatment or dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with LENVIMA, 
particularly when you are also receiving or have received injections of bisphosphonates (used to 
treat or prevent bone disorders). 
are receiving or have received some medicines used to treat osteoporosis (antiresorptive 
medicines) or cancer medicines which alter formation of blood vessels (so called angiogenesis 
inhibitors), as the risk of bone damage in the jaw may be increased.

Before taking LENVIMA, your doctor may carry out some tests, for example to check your blood 
pressure and your liver or kidney function and to see if you have low levels of salt and high levels of 
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood. Your doctor will discuss the results of these tests with you 
and decide whether you can be given LENVIMA. You may need to have additional treatment with 
other medicines, to take a lower dose of LENVIMA, or to take extra care due to an increased risk of 
side effects. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor before taking LENVIMA. 
Children and adolescents 
LENVIMA is not currently recommended for use in children and adolescents younger than 18 years 
old. 
Other medicines and LENVIMA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes herbal preparations and medicines without a prescription. 
Contraception, pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
• 
If you could become pregnant, use highly effective contraception while taking this medicine, 
and for at least one month after you finish treatment. Because it is not known if LENVIMA can 
reduce the effect of the oral contraceptive pill, if this is your normal method of contraception 
you should ensure you also add a barrier method such as the cap or condoms if you have sex 
during treatment with LENVIMA. 
Do not take LENVIMA if you are planning to become pregnant during your treatment. This is 
because it may seriously harm your baby. 
• 
56 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
If you become pregnant while being treated with LENVIMA, tell your doctor immediately. 
Your doctor will help you decide whether the treatment should be continued. 
Do not breast-feed if you are taking LENVIMA. This is because the medicine passes into breast 
milk and may seriously harm your breastfed baby. 
Driving and using machines 
LENVIMA may cause side effects that can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving 
or using machines if you feel dizzy or tired.

Taking this medicine  
• 
• 
• 
You can take the capsules with or without food. 
Do not open the capsules to avoid exposure to the contents of the capsule. 
Swallow the capsules whole with water. If you cannot swallow the capsules whole, a liquid 
mixture can be prepared using water, apple juice, or milk. The liquid mixture may be given by 
mouth or through a feeding tube. If given through a feeding tube, then the liquid mixture should 
be prepared using water. If not used at the time of preparation, the liquid mixture may be stored 
in a covered container and must be refrigerated at 2ºC to 8ºC for a maximum of 24 hours. Shake 
the liquid mixture for 30 seconds after removing from the refrigerator. If the liquid mixture is 
not used within 24 hours of preparation, it should be thrown away. 
Preparation and administration of the liquid mixture: 
o 
Place the whole capsule(s) corresponding to the prescribed dose (up to 5 capsules) in a 
small container (approximately 20 mL (4 tsp) capacity) or oral syringe (20 mL); do not 
break or crush capsules. 
Add 3 mL of liquid to the container or oral syringe. Wait 10 minutes for the capsule shell 
(outer surface) to dissolve, then stir or shake the mixture for 3 minutes until the capsules 
are fully dissolved. 
 
If liquid mixture is prepared in an oral syringe, cap the syringe, remove plunger 
and use a second syringe or medicine dropper to add the liquid to the first syringe, 
then replace plunger prior to mixing. 
o 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o 
Drink the liquid mixture from the container or use an oral syringe to take directly into the 
mouth or through a feeding tube. 
Next, add an additional 2 mL of liquid to the container, or oral syringe using a second syringe or 
dropper, swirl or shake and take the liquid mixture. Repeat this step at least twice and until there 
is no visible sign of the mixture to make sure all of the medication is taken. 
Take the capsules at about the same time each day.

• 
How long to take LENVIMA 
You will usually carry on taking this medicine as long as you are getting benefit. 
If you take more LENVIMA than you should 
If you take more LENVIMA than you should, talk to a doctor or pharmacist straight away. Take the 
medicine pack with you. 
If you forget to take LENVIMA 
Do not take a double dose (two doses at the same time) to make up for a forgotten dose. 
What to do if you forget to take your dose depends on how long it is until your next dose.  
• 
If it is 12 hours or more until your next dose: take the missed dose as soon as you remember. 
Then take the next dose at the normal time.  
If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose: skip the missed dose. Then take the next dose at 
the normal time.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following side effects - you may need 
urgent medical treatment:  
• 
feeling numb or weak on one side of your body, severe headache, seizure, confusion, difficulty 
talking, vision changes or feeling dizzy - these may be signs of a stroke, bleeding on your brain, 
or the effect on your brain of a severe increase in blood pressure. 
chest pain or pressure, pain in your arms, back, neck or jaw, being short of breath, rapid or 
irregular heart rate, coughing, bluish colour to lips or fingers, feeling very tired – these may be 
signs of a heart problem, a blood clot in your lung or a leak of air from your lung into your chest 
so your lung cannot inflate. 
severe pain in your belly (abdomen) - this may be due to a hole in the wall of your gut or a 
fistula (a hole in your gut which links through a tube-like passage to another part of your body 
or skin). 
black, tarry, or bloody stools, or coughing up of blood - these may be signs of bleeding inside 
your body. 
yellow skin or yellowing of the whites of the eyes (jaundice) or drowsiness, confusion, poor 
concentration – these may be signs of liver problems. 
diarrhoea, feeling and being sick (nausea and vomiting) - these are very common side effects 
that can become serious if they cause you to become dehydrated, which can lead to kidney 
failure. Your doctor can give you medicine to reduce these side effects. 
pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or sores inside the mouth, numbness or a feeling of 
heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth - these could be signs of bone damage in the jaw 
(osteonecrosis).

Update as of 1 December 2023 
COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva was withdrawn from the EU market at the request of 
the company for commercial reasons. The withdrawal does not affect the 
information provided in this safety update. 
The safety of authorised COVID-19 vaccines is continuously monitored, and 
updated information is regularly provided to the public.  
Safety updates outline the outcomes from assessments of emerging 
worldwide safety data carried out mainly by EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee (PRAC) (section 1). They also outline how safety is 
monitored and contain high-level information on suspected adverse reaction 
reports, which PRAC takes into account in its assessments (section 2).  
This safety update follows the update of 10 November 2022 and reflects the 
main assessment outcomes of the PRAC meeting held from 28 November to 
1 December 2022.

COVID-19 vaccines safety update 
EMA confirms that the benefits of all currently authorised COVID-19 
vaccines continue to outweigh their side effects, given the risk of COVID-19 
illness and related complications, including hospitalisation and death. 
EMA will cease the publication of monthly safety updates for COVID-19 
vaccines with this safety update of December 2022.  
The wide uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in immunisation programmes during 
the pandemic emergency led to a rapid accumulation of extensive safety 
data from spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions. Since the 
first vaccines were authorised in December 2020, EMA’s monthly safety 
updates have provided information on the assessment of these reports and 
data from other sources. 
The majority of the EU population has now received at least one COVID-19 
vaccine2; data from clinical trials, other studies and spontaneous reporting 
have established the safety profiles of these vaccines. 
As for all medicines authorised in the EU, safety monitoring and timely 
assessment of emerging data will continue for the COVID-19 vaccines. If 
there are any major safety-related changes to the existing product 
information for any COVID-19 vaccine, these will be communicated in the 
PRAC highlights, together with dedicated public health communications as 
needed. For each vaccine, all identified side effects are listed in the relevant 
product information in all the languages of the European Union 
(EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) (see section 1). High-level information 
on suspected adverse reaction reports will continue to be updated monthly 
on EMA’s webpage on COVID-19 vaccines. The website EudraVigilance – 
European database of suspected drug reaction reports will continue to be 
updated weekly. 
Key messages from the latest safety 
assessments 
No updates are currently needed to the product 
information of any of the authorised COVID-19 vaccines.

2.  How safety is monitored 
Before COVID-19 vaccines were granted EU marketing authorisation, the 
efficacy and safety of the vaccines were assessed in pre-clinical studies and 
large clinical trials. 
All relevant new information emerging worldwide on the vaccines since 
marketing authorisation is collected and promptly assessed. This is in line 
with the pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines of the EU 
regulatory network (comprising the regulatory bodies of the EU Member 
States, EMA and the European Commission). 
EMA’s detailed assessments take into account all available data from all 
sources to draw robust conclusions on the safety of the vaccines. These 
data include clinical trial results, reports of suspected side effects, 
epidemiological studies monitoring the safety of the vaccine, toxicological 
investigations and any other relevant information. 
Summary safety reports 
The pharmacovigilance plan for COVID-19 vaccines includes monthly 
summary safety reports (MSSRs) which are compiled by the marketing 
authorisation holders to support timely and continuous benefit-risk 
evaluations for COVID-19 vaccines used during the pandemic. MSSRs are 
intended to be compiled in the first months of marketing. Afterwards, 
summary safety reports may cover time periods longer than a month or

data from EU Member States as well as from the additional countries of the European 
Economic Area (EEA) Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

COVID-19 vaccines safety update 
may not be necessary anymore. Summary safety reports complement 
periodic safety update reports (PSURs).  
Case reports of suspected side effects 
Collecting reports of medical events and problems that occur following the 
use of a medicine, and therefore might be side effects, is one of the pillars 
of the EU safety monitoring system.  
Healthcare professionals and vaccinated individuals are encouraged to 
report to their national competent authorities all suspected side effects 
individuals may have experienced after receiving a vaccine even if it is 
unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. For more information on how to 
report, including the importance of detailing the vaccine product name and 
the batch, see Reporting suspected side effects.  
These spontaneous reports are collected in EudraVigilance, the EU database 
used for monitoring and analysing suspected side effects. Publicly available 
information can be accessed via the website EudraVigilance – European 
database of suspected drug reaction reports (in all EU/EEA languages).  
As of 23 November 2022, EudraVigilance contained the following: 
•  Comirnaty: a total of 967,351 cases (plus 3,670 cases for Comirnaty 
adapted bivalent vaccines) of suspected side effects spontaneously 
reported from EU/EEA countries; 8,368 of these reported a fatal 
outcome (plus 51 for Comirnaty adapted bivalent vaccines)7,8 (by 13 
November 2022, about 685 million doses of Comirnaty original vaccine 
and about 16.1 million doses of Comirnaty adapted bivalent vaccines 
had been given to people in the EU/EEA9); 
•  COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva: 24 case of 
suspected side effects spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 
none reported a fatal outcome6,7 (by 13 November 2022, about 2,900 
doses of COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva had been 
given to people in the EU/EEA8); 
• 
Jcovden: a total of 58,223 cases of suspected side effects 
spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 339 of these reported a 
fatal outcome6,7 (by 13 November 2022, about 18.6 million doses of 
Jcovden had been administered to people in the EU/EEA8); 
7 These figures have been calculated excluding cases reported from Northern Ireland (EU 
reporting requirements for suspected adverse reactions to EudraVigilance apply to 
Northern Ireland in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland).  
8 Source: EudraVigilance. These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public 
database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side effect. 
As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case report, 
the total number of side effects will never match the number of individual cases. Similarly, 
this public database does not provide the total number of cases reported with a fatal 
outcome.

•  Nuvaxovid: a total of 1,423 cases of suspected side effects 
spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 1 reported a fatal 
outcome10,11 (by 13 November 2022, about 361,300 doses of Nuvaxovid 
had been administered to people in the EU/EEA12); 
•  Spikevax: a total of 270,827 cases (plus 3,120 cases for Spikevax 
adapted bivalent vaccines) of suspected side effects spontaneously 
reported from EU/EEA countries; 1,161 of these reported a fatal 
outcome (plus 16 for Spikevax adapted bivalent products)9,10 
November 2022, about 161 million doses of Spikevax original vaccine 
(by 13 
and about 317,800 doses of Spikevax adapted bivalent vaccines had 
been given to people in the EU/EEA11); 
•  Vaxzevria: a total of 328,643 cases of suspected side effects 
spontaneously reported from EU/EEA countries; 1,579 of these reported 
a fatal outcome9,10 (by 13 November 2022, about 68.8 million doses of 
Vaxzevria had been given to people in the EU/EEA11); 
•  VidPrevtyn Beta: no cases of suspected side effects spontaneously 
reported from EU/EEA countries9,10 (by 13 November 2022, the vaccine 
had not yet been used in the EU/EEA11). 
These reports describe suspected side effects in individuals, i.e. 
medical events observed following the use of a vaccine. The fact 
that someone has had a medical issue or died after vaccination does 
not necessarily mean that this was caused by the vaccine. This may 
have been caused, for example, by health problems not related to 
the vaccination.  
The EU regulatory network continuously monitors EudraVigilance to detect 
any new safety issues. EudraVigilance relies on individual healthcare 
professionals and patients to report their own experience. The monitoring 
detects unusual or unexpected patterns in the reports received for further 
investigation and risk assessment.  
Planned and ongoing studies 
The companies that market COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide results 
from ongoing clinical trials. They also conduct additional studies to monitor 
the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines as they are used in vaccination 
campaigns and other clinical practice. For the list of planned and ongoing 
10 These figures have been calculated excluding cases reported from Northern Ireland (EU 
reporting requirements for suspected adverse reactions to EudraVigilance apply to 
Northern Ireland in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland).  
11 Source: EudraVigilance. These figures cannot be extracted directly from the public 
database of suspected adverse reactions, which groups information per type of side effect. 
As more than one suspected side effect may have been included in a single case report,

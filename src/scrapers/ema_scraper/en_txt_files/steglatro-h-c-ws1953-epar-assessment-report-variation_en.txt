3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
3.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
T2DM is a chronic disease that is a major public healthcare problem globally. The prevalence of diabetes 
has been growing rapidly in recent decades. Patients with T2DM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of CV 
disease relative to those without T2DM, and CV disease is the leading cause of death and complications in 
patients with T2DM. 
The claimed therapeutic indication 
Based on the submitted data on CV safety, the MAH wish to extend the indication as follows: 
“Steglatro is indicated for the treatment of in adults aged 18 years and older with insufficiently controlled 
type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control:  
•  as monotherapy in patients for whom the use of when metformin is considered inappropriate 
due to intolerance or contraindications.  
• 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
(For study results with respect to combinations of therapies, and effects on glycaemic control, 
cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.)” 
“Segluromet is indicated in adults for the treatment of aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
• 
in patients not adequately insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of 
metformin alone 
in combination with in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin in addition to 
other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes in patients insufficiently controlled with 
metformin and these products  
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets.  
(For study results with respect to combinations of therapies, and effects on glycaemic control, 
cardiovascular events and the population studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.) 
Epidemiology 
T2DM is a chronic disease and the prevalence of diabetes has been growing rapidly in recent decades. 
The International Diabetes Federation estimated the global prevalence of diabetes as 151 million in 2000, 
rising to 382 million in 2013, and is projected to reach 642 million by the year 2040. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 9/113 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical presentation and prognosis 
Patients with diabetes are at high risk for adverse outcomes from ASCVD, HF, and CKD. Patients with 
T2DM have a 2- to 4- fold increased risk of CV disease relative to those without T2DM, and CV disease is 
the leading cause of death and complications in patients with T2DM.  
The lifetime adjusted cumulative hazard for incident HF in patients with T2DM, hypertension, and obesity 
with an index age of 55 years reaches approximately 60%. Moreover, patients with T2DM represent a 
substantial proportion of patients hospitalized for HF. In a large global registry, patients with history of 
atherothrombosis and T2DM had a 30% greater risk of HHF than patients with atherothrombosis but 
without T2DM. In a large European registry, T2DM was prevalent in approximately one-half of all patients 
admitted for HF in 1 year at 211 cardiology centers. Compared with those patients without diabetes, 
patients with diabetes had higher cumulative rates of in hospital and 1-year mortality and 1-year HF re-
hospitalization, even when adjusting for multiple clinical risk factors.  
T2DM is also the most common cause of CKD and the most common aetiology for patients to progress to 
dialysis. Moreover, patients with T2DM and CKD have higher risks of death and CV events than 
progression to ESRD. 
Management 
In large outcome studies, members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class have been shown to reduce the risk of CV 
and renal outcomes in subjects with and without T2DM. A consistent finding in all of these studies is a 
robust effect of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment on reducing the risk of HHF. Preservation of renal function has 
also been a consistent finding in these studies. 
Current diabetes and cardiovascular society guidelines have been significantly impacted by the results of 
these outcome studies. The 2020 American Diabetes Association Standards of Care recommends that if 
ASCVD predominates, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven CV disease benefit, if 
eGFR is adequate, should be used for the treatment of patients with T2DM. However, if HF and/or CKD 
predominates, the use of a SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit in reducing HF and/or CKD progression, if 
eGFR is adequate, should be used (if tolerated). 
3.1.2.  About the product 
Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2 that possesses a high selectivity over glucose transport via SGLT1 
and several other glucose transporters (GLUT1 4). Ertugliflozin inhibits renal glucose reabsorption 
resulting in urinary glucose excretion and thereby reducing plasma glucose and HbA1c in subjects with 
T2DM.  
Ertugliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with 
T2DM. Phase 3 studies in adults with T2DM have shown that treatment with ertugliflozin as monotherapy 
and in combination with other AHAs improves glycaemic control, reduces BW and BP, and is well 
tolerated.  
Ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) is available as an individual product and in 2 FDCs (ertugliflozin/sitagliptin 
FDC and ertugliflozin/metformin FDC).

EMA/612874/2021 
Page 10/113 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program supporting the indication for the treatment of adults with T2DM was 
planned, conducted, and analysed in accordance with the EU regulatory guidance documents that were in 
effect at the time that the Phase 3 program initiated, i.e. the “Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus” (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1). 
VERTIS CV was conducted to satisfy US FDA and EMA guidelines for demonstration of CV safety for novel 
AHAs in the pre-approval and post-approval periods. At the time of the original submission of the 
ertugliflozin, ertugliflozin/sitagliptin FDC, and ertugliflozin/metformin FDC dossiers, an assessment of CV 
safety based on a prespecified CVMA, demonstrated that ertugliflozin was not associated with an increase 
in CV risk in accordance with US FDA recommendations for T2DM drug development.  
The EMA draft reflection paper on assessment of CV risk of medicinal products for the treatment of CV 
and metabolic diseases (EMA/CHMP/50549/2015) was released during the conduct of the ertugliflozin 
Phase 3 program. The applicant considers that the approach taken to enable assessment of the CV risk 
for ertugliflozin is in keeping with this draft reflection paper. This is agreed. 
Scientific advice related to the VERTIS CV study has been provided by the EMA: 
EMEA/H/SA/2164/2/2011/III (ertugliflozin) 
As part of this advice, the design of the CVOT study was discussed by the CHMP. The advice discussed 
the choice of the endpoint, the HbA1c inclusion criterion and aspects on the interim analysis. 
It was stressed that if the purpose of the study is to show reduction of CV risk, only MACE events 
according to the strict definition will be acceptable as the primary endpoint (see Q 11). 
EMEA/H/SA/2164/2/FU/1/2013/II 
As part of this advice, the acceptability of the two included 18-week glycaemic sub-studies: add-on to 1) 
insulin ± metformin, 2) SU monotherapy, was discussed. The CHMP endorsed the applicant’s approach 
but noted that the duration is considered relatively short for efficacy, and that longer follow-up is 
important. It was also discussed that the population in the CVOT may not be representative for the 
general population of patients with T2DM, as only patients with CV-disease will be included. With regards 
to the add-on to insulin sub-study, it was noted that a heterogeneous population with different insulin 
regimens would be included. Beneficial trend needs to be shown for all regimens.  
EMEA/H/SA/2164/2/FU/2/2016/II 
The advice discussed the acceptability of the amendment made to the CVOT and the addition of a third 
glycaemic sub-study: add-on to metformin + SU. The CHMP concluded that the changes from the 
previous proposal were not considered crucial, but that some comments were deemed necessary. As 
pointed out in the previous advice, the three 18-week glycaemic efficacy sub-studies (add on to insulin ± 
metformin, metformin + SU and SU monotherapy) embedded in the CVOT are considered of marginal 
duration, and a longer observation is still recommended. It was also noted that the fact that ertugliflozin 
is not a first in class drug, may alleviate some of the concerns with regards to some of the proposed 
treatment combinations. It was also, again, noted the data in adjunct to insulin might be difficult to 
interpret because of the inclusion of short-acting/mix/basal insulin, rendering the groups to assess safety 
and efficacy rather small.  
Any potential claim for superiority regarding CV death, CV death/hospitalization for heart failure, and/or 
chronic kidney disease would be limited to diabetic patients. Although these endpoints are of interest, 
specific claims may require separate dedicated studies.

EMA/612874/2021 
Page 11/113 
 
 
 
 
The advice given by the CHMP has been followed in all essential aspects.   
3.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
According to the MAH, VERTIS CV and the three glycaemic sub-studies were conducted following 
appropriate Good Clinical Practice standards and considerations for the ethical treatment of human 
participants that were in place at the time the studies were performed. 
3.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
3.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has submitted a rationale for not submitting an updated environmental risk assessment. It 
is agreed that the proposed change of the indication does not significantly increase the extent of use, and 
the omission of an updated ERA is thus justified. 
3.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of ertugliflozin.  
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
This application is supported by one study (VERTIS CV) which includes three sub-studies. In the following 
the general design of the study is presented. The sub-studies support treatment combinations not 
investigated at the time of the MAA. Data from the VERTIS CV, on the use of ertugliflozin in patients with 
renal impairment, is also presented.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the WSA. 
The WSA has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Title of Study: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Assess 
Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Treatment With Ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) in 
Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Established Vascular Disease, the VERTIS CV Study 
Methods 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven study 
that included a main CV study and 3 glycaemic sub-studies in subjects receiving specific background anti-
hyperglycaemic treatments. 
This study was intended to address 2 overarching objectives. The first focused on CV safety (non-
inferiority) and the second focused on CV and renal efficacy (superiority). 
The doses of ertugliflozin evaluated in this study were 5 mg and 15 mg qd.  
Subjects were counselled on appropriate dietary and lifestyle guidelines for T2DM at the Day 1 Visit (V2) 
and were asked to maintain these guidelines throughout participation in the study. Counselling on dietary 
guidelines was in accordance with local medical standards of care for subjects with T2DM.

Sub-Studies) 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were: 
•  Subjects ≥40 years of age with a diagnosis of T2DM in accordance with ADA guidelines. 
•  A1C at the Screening Visit (V1) of 7.0-10.5% (53-91 mmol/mol) on stable AHA(s) or on no 
background AHA for at least 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (V1). Subjects treated with 
another SGLT2 inhibitor, rosiglitazone, or chlorpropamide from 8 weeks before the Screening Visit 
(V1) were not allowed to enrol into the study. 
•  Body mass index (BMI) ≥18.0 kg/m2. 
• 
Evidence or a history of atherosclerosis involving the coronary, cerebral or peripheral vascular 
systems, with the most recent event having occurred at least 3 months (90 days) prior to the 
Screening Visit (V1).   
Key exclusion criteria were: 
•  Subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure (HF) at the Screening 
Visit (V1). Class III or IV HF was exclusionary for subjects in Cohort 1. 
•  History of type 1 diabetes mellitus or a history of ketoacidosis. 
•  Screening fasting plasma or finger stick glucose >270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L), confirmed by a single 
repeat following counselling on exercise and diet. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 17/113 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Subjects taking blood pressure or lipid altering medications who had not been on a stable dose for 
at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects who required a change in blood pressure and/or 
lipid altering medications to meet the entry criteria related to blood pressure and/or triglycerides 
had to be on a stable dose of such therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
•  Subjects who were not weight-stable due to a weight-loss program, a weight-loss medication, 
other medication associated with weight changes, or had undergone bariatric surgery. Weight-
stable was defined as <5% change in body weight in the last 6 months. 
• 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as determined by the 4-variable 
modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation, confirmed via a single repeat if deemed 
necessary. 
•  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2 × the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) at the Screening Visit (V1), or a total bilirubin >1.5 × the ULN unless the subject 
had a history of Gilbert’s. 
Treatments 
Ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 10mg, and matching placebos were supplied as immediate-release tablets 
for oral administration. On Day 1, each subject was randomly assigned to ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 
15 mg, or placebo. 
Treatment for Glycaemic Control for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
To enable an assessment of the glycaemic effects of ertugliflozin, doses of background AHAs were 
required to be held constant in all subjects for the initial 18 weeks of the study with 2 exceptions: 
• 
First, subjects were prescribed glycaemic rescue therapy if they met specific, progressively more 
stringent, glycaemic thresholds (see Table 3) on a repeated, confirmed FPG measured by the 
central lab.  
•  Second, a subject experiencing clinically significant hypoglycaemia according to the investigator 
at any time during the study was permitted to have the dose of appropriate AHA (e.g. insulin, SU, 
glinide) reduced or discontinued as per the judgment of the investigator or the treating physician. 
Choice and dosing of glycaemic rescue was at the discretion of the investigator or the treating physician. 
Following the Week 18 visit, the investigator/treating physician was able to make any changes in the 
subject’s AHA treatment regimen to achieve an appropriate A1C level (with exception of prohibited 
concomitant medications listed in Section 4.2 of the protocol). 
Table 3 Glycaemic Rescue Criteria for All Subjects for the First 18 Weeks 
Subjects who received glycaemic rescue therapy continued taking study medication for the duration of 
the study unless they met withdrawal criteria described in Section 6.7 of the protocol. 
Treatment for Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease 
Subjects may have been administered other medications necessary for the treatment of concomitant 
medical disorders, particularly other disorders that were CV risk factors, including but not limited to 
hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Attention was to be placed on appropriate use of medications

recommended in local country or national guidelines including anti-platelet therapy, statins, and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Smokers were to be counselled to quit and received 
treatment if needed. 
The investigator or the treating physician was able to make any changes in the subject’s background CV 
treatment regimen to achieve appropriate targets for secondary disease prevention at any time during 
the study. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of ertugliflozin compared with placebo on the time to first occurrence 
of the composite endpoint of MACE.  (MACE: CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] or non-fatal 
stroke)  
Key Secondary Objectives: 
To demonstrate the superiority of ertugliflozin compared with placebo on the time to first occurrence of 
the composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). 
To demonstrate the superiority of ertugliflozin compared with placebo on the time to CV death. 
To demonstrate the superiority of ertugliflozin compared with placebo on the time to first occurrence of 
the composite endpoint of renal death, renal dialysis/transplant, or ≥2 × increase in baseline serum 
creatinine.

• 
Proportions of subjects with A1C <7% (53 mmol/mol) and <6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at 12, 24 and 
36 months and annually thereafter. 
•  Change from baseline in FPG at Week 18, Week 52 and annually thereafter. 
•  Changes from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at Week 18, Week 52 and annually 
thereafter. 
•  Change from baseline in body weight at Week 18, Week 52 and annually thereafter. 
Sample size 
The cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin was assessed in two stages.   
Stage 1 consists of a meta-analysis of MACE plus events across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 development 
program with the majority of events expected to come from this trial.   
Stage 2 consists of an analysis of MACE and secondary endpoints [e.g. CV death or hospitalization for 
heart failure (composite), CV death (individual component), and the renal composite] in this trial. The two 
doses of ertugliflozin (5 and 15 mg) will be pooled for the purpose of all these analyses.  
The primary objective for the Stage1 across-program meta-analysis will be addressed by testing the 
hypotheses H0:HR>=1.8 versus H1:HR<1.8 for the MACE plus endpoint; the primary Stage2 analysis 
(assessed within this study) will be addressed by testing the hypotheses H0:HR>=1.3 versus H1:HR<1.3 
for the MACE endpoint. For these analyses, the HR represents the risk of ertugliflozin relative to a non-
ertugliflozin comparator group at Stage 1 and relative to placebo at Stage 2 as measured by the hazard 
ratio. Stage 1 of the trial uses a group sequential design with up to two analyses:  an interim analysis and 
a final analysis.  
For these Stage 1 analyses, using an O’Brien-Fleming type alpha spending function, and analyses at 130 
and 173 adjudicated MACE plus events, the meta-analysis will have approximately 95% power to 
demonstrate non-inferiority of ertugliflozin to a non-ertugliflozin comparator group when there is truly no 
difference between treatments (HR=1.0) using the non-inferiority margin of 1.8 and testing at the overall 
one-sided alpha level of 0.025. Stage 2 of the trial uses a group sequential design with up to two 
analyses: an interim analysis and a final analysis. The Stage 2 interim analysis and the final analysis are 
planned to occur when approximately 714 and 939 adjudicated MACE events have accrued in this study. 
These analyses will assess the hazard ratio for the MACE endpoint with respect to the 1.3 non-inferiority 
margin. If non-inferiority is established for the primary MACE endpoint, then tests of superiority on the 
secondary endpoints of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (composite), CV death (individual 
component), and the renal composite will also be performed in a sequential manner. If any of the first 
three tests in this four-step testing sequence are unsuccessful at the interim analysis, the study may be 
continued to the final analysis (depending on the result of futility assessment). For the primary Stage 2 
analyses, using an O’Brien-Fleming type alpha spending function and analyses at approximately 714 and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 20/113 
 
 
 
 
939 adjudicated MACE events, the study will have approximately 96% power to demonstrate non-
inferiority of ertugliflozin to placebo when there is truly no difference between treatments (HR=1.0) using 
the non-inferiority margin of 1.3 and testing at the overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025. The accrual of 
714 MACE events (i.e. an information fraction of about 76%) was selected as the time point for interim 
assessment as the power to demonstrate non-inferiority at the interim with this number of events is 
>80% and the estimated corresponding number of CV deaths and heart failure hospitalizations(i.e. 442 
events) provides approximately 70% power to detect a 25% risk reduction in this secondary endpoint at 
the interim. With two enrolment periods of 19 months each and assuming an event rate of 3.5% per 
annum for MACE, a total of approximately 8000 subjects (about 4000 per enrolment cohort) randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to ertugliflozin 5mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg or placebo will be sufficient to accrue 
approximately 714 MACE events within approximately 5.0 years and approximately 939 MACE events 
within approximately 6.1 years from the start of this study. These calculations assume that subjects will 
withdraw from the study at a rate of 5% per annum. 
Power for Secondary Hypotheses For the Stage2 analyses of secondary endpoints, using an O’Brien-
Fleming alpha-spending approach and assuming accrual of at least 442 and 582 composite events of 
cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure at the interim and final analysis respectively, the 
study will have approximately 90% power to demonstrate superiority of ertugliflozin to placebo on the 
composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure when the true HR=0.75. Moreover, 
assuming accrual of at least 287 and 377 cardiovascular death events at the interim and final analysis 
respectively, the study will have approximately 83% power to demonstrate superiority of ertugliflozin to 
placebo on cardiovascular death when the true HR=0.725. With accrual of at least 144 and 190 renal 
composite events at the interim and final analysis respectively, the study will have approximately 79% 
power to demonstrate superiority of ertugliflozin to placebo on the renal composite endpoint when the 
true HR=0.65. 
Sample Size for Insulin with or without Metformin Add-on Glycemic Sub-Study: The sub-study is powered 
to demonstrate superiority of ertugliflozin compared with placebo in reducing HbA1c from Baseline to 
Week18. It is estimated that a minimum of 450 subjects will be enrolled into the sub-study. The sub-
study enrollment will not be allowed to exceed 50% of the overall trial sample size. The final 
determination of inclusion in the sub-study will be based on a programmatic assessment of the sub-study 
criteria. Assuming a standard deviation of 1.0% and a lost to follow up rate of 10%, a sample size of 450 
subjects (150per arm) will provide approximately 98% power to detect a difference of 0.5% in the 
reduction of HbA1c from Baseline to Week18 between ertugliflozin and placebo using a 2-sided 0.05 alpha 
level test. 
Sample Size for SU Monotherapy Add-on Glycemic Sub-Study: The primary endpoint for the sub-study is 
the HbA1c change from Baseline to Week18.  It is estimated that approximately 170 subjects will be 
enrolled into the sub-study. The final determination of inclusion in the sub-study will be based on a 
programmatic assessment of the sub-study criteria. Assuming a standard deviation of 1.0%, a lost to 
follow up rate of 10%, and a sample size of 170 subjects (~56 per arm), the power to detect a between 
treatment difference of 0.6% will be approximately 85% using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  
Sample Size for Metformin with SU Add-on Glycemic Sub-Study: The primary endpoint is the HbA1c 
change from Baseline to Week18. It is estimated that at least 260 subjects will satisfy the criteria for 
inclusion in this sub-study. Assuming a standard deviation of 1.0% and a lost to follow up rate of 10%, a 
sample size of 260 subjects (~86 per arm) will provide approximately 96% power to detect a difference 
of 0.6% between ertugliflozin and placebo using a 2-sided 0.05 alpha level test. As there is no separate 
randomization stratum for the metformin with SU sub-study, this sub-study will consist of a sub-group of 
subjects from the “main cardiovascular study”. The determination of inclusion in the sub-study was based 
on a programmatic assessment of the sub-study criteria.

Randomisation 
Approximately 8000 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 5mg ertugliflozin once 
daily, ertugliflozin 15 mg once daily or matching placebo. Allocation of subjects to treatment groups 
proceeded through the use of a randomization system (IVRS or equivalent). Subjects were enrolled in two 
distinct cohorts. Cohort 1 refers to subjects randomized under the original protocol prior to Amendment 
1, and Cohort 2 refers to subjects randomized under Amendment 1. Each cohort has a targeted 
enrolment of approximately 4000 subjects. The randomization was stratified by cohort (i.e. Cohort 2 have 
a separate randomization list). Subjects in Cohort1 were stratified into the main cardiovascular study, the 
insulin (with or with metformin) sub-study or the SU monotherapy sub- study, according to their 
background anti-hyperglycaemic treatment. Subject information was entered into the system starting at 
the Screening visit(V1) when the subject was assigned to a unique identifier which was retained 
throughout the duration of participation in the trial. On the Day1 visit (V2), once the inclusion, exclusion 
and randomization criteria have been verified, each subject was provided with a subject randomization 
number. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study utilized a double-dummy approach to maintain double-blinding, with a placebo tablet matching 
the ertugliflozin 5mg tablet and another placebo tablet matching the ertugliflozin 10mg tablet. Subjects 
were instructed to take 1 ertugliflozin 5 mg tablet (or matching placebo) and 1 ertugliflozin 10 mg tablet 
(or matching placebo) daily, according to their assigned treatment (ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 
mg, or placebo). Thus, all subjects were to take 2 tablets each day of ertugliflozin/placebo. 
The trial was subject-, investigator- and sponsor-blinded. At the initiation of the trial, the sites were 
instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The method was an electronic process via IVRS.  
Blinding codes should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety. Whenever 
possible, the investigator or sub-investigator should consult with a member of the sponsor trial team prior 
to breaking the blind. When the blinding code was broken, the reason must be fully documented and 
entered in the source documents. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary analysis set (CV FAS) for the analysis of cardiovascular safety in Study B1521021 includes all 
subjects who were randomized into the study and who received at least one dose of blinded study 
medication. In addition, for Stage 2 superiority analyses, an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set was 
defined to include all randomized subjects in Study B1521021 and will be referred to as the CV ITT set. 
The data to be included from subjects in these analysis sets varied based on the analysis ascertainment 
window. 
Statistical analysis methods 
The two doses of ertugliflozin were to be pooled for the analysis of cardiovascular endpoints. 
The time-to-first-event endpoints was analyzed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model 
including treatment group (pooled ertugliflozin doses or placebo) as a covariate. For Stage 2 analyses of 
Study B1521021, Cohort was included as a stratification factor. For the MACE, CV death/HHF, CV death, 
and renal composite (Stage 2) endpoints, a point estimate and alpha-adjusted (ie, adjusted for multiple 
looks) two-sided confidence interval for the hazard ratio was provided for testing hypotheses. An O’Brien-

Fleming type alpha-spending function was utilized. P-values to assess the significance of the hazard ratio 
was also reported for these endpoints. 
For other CV endpoints not included in the formal testing sequence, a point estimate and nominal (ie, 
unadjusted for multiple looks) two-sided 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio was calculated 
based on the Cox proportional hazards model. 
Graphical summaries included Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment group in the analysis (pooled 
ertugliflozin doses vs. non-ertugliflozin comparator or placebo) and separately by dose (ertugliflozin 5 
mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg).

Sensitivity analyses 
The stratified CPH model utilized in the primary analyses assumes a constant hazard across strata. An 
alternative approach was utilized as a sensitivity analysis. The (log) HR is estimated separately for each 
stratum using an unstratified Cox model, and the stratum-specific estimates were combined for overall 
inference using “minimum risk” stratum weights. This sensitivity analysis is referred to as the minimum 
risk method. 
For time-to-event analyses, such as those required for the primary and secondary CV endpoints, subjects 
who are lost to follow-up will be censored. A subject was considered lost to follow-up if it is not possible 
to determine whether or not that subject had an event during the study period based on available data. 
Such subjects will be censored at the date of last contact except in the case of mortality analyses where 
the vital status is known or where a vital status death contributes to the outcome of interest. Identifying 
the reasons for missing data is an important step in assessing the appropriateness of the models used in 
the statistical analyses. An accounting of missingness (amount of missing data and associated reasons) 
were to be provided for the primary endpoint. 
To address the robustness of the primary and key secondary endpoint analyses to the impact of missing 
data, sensitivity analyses will be performed using a multiple imputation with retrieved dropout (MI-RD) 
approach. These sensitivity analyses imputed event status and event time for each subject with missing 
data conditional on censoring time and vital status. The imputation is based on a parametric survival 
distribution (eg, Weibull distribution) fit to the available data from subjects who discontinued study 
medication but remained in the trial for follow-up (ie, retrieved dropouts). The parameters of the 
distribution are estimated separately for each treatment group. Time on treatment is included as a 
covariate in the imputation model. Each dataset completed by imputation is analysed using the same Cox 
model from the primary analysis, and the results from 100 imputations is combined based on Rubin’s 
rule. 
An accounting of vital status will also be provided, and subjects with unknown vital status will form the 
basis for sensitivity analyses on both the CV death and all-cause mortality endpoints. These sensitivity 
analyses will utilize a similar MI-RD approach as that described for the primary endpoint with the 
parametric distribution being fit to data from subjects in each treatment group who discontinued study 
medication but had known vital status at end of study. 
Tipping point analyses was also conducted with imputation of missing data based on the Weibull 
distribution. For the tipping point analysis, subjects in the Ertugliflozin group who discontinued the trial 
without an event are assumed to have the same or a higher hazard (δ ≥ 1) compared to those in the 
same treatment group who remained in the trial. The same hazard (δ = 1) is assumed for subjects in the 
placebo group who discontinued the trial without an event compared to those in the placebo group who 
remained in the trial. Given a value of δ, the primary Cox model is applied to the imputed dataset, and a 
p-value is obtained. These steps are repeated with values of δ ranging from 1 to a pre-specified upper 
limit. The smallest value of δ under which the significance disappears (ie, p-value >0.05) is taken as the 
tipping point. 
Multiplicity 
The overall Type I error rate in Stage 2 was strongly controlled (at 2.5% one-sided) based on repeated 
hypothesis testing using a sequentially rejective graphical procedure. The following chart summarizes the 
fixed testing sequence and the alpha levels that were utilized for each endpoint at each analysis time 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 24/113 
 
 
 
 
 
point in Stage 2 (assuming the planned information fraction of 0.76 at the interim). Note that alpha 
allocated to the secondary superiority tests at the interim will be considered to be consumed even if the 
test is not conducted due to the hierarchical testing sequence. Also note that any hypotheses that are 
rejected at the interim will not be formally retested at the final analysis, although supportive analyses 
based on all available data at the end of study will be provided. 
As a single interim analysis and a final analysis are planned, an O’Brien-Fleming (OBF) alpha spending 
function are used to construct group sequential boundaries to control the type I error rate. The actual 
boundary and the alpha to be spent is determined from the actual number of events observed at the time 
of the interim analysis using the OBF alpha spending function. The boundaries for the final analysis were 
adjusted according to the actual alpha spent at the interim analysis and the actual numbers of events 
observed at the interim and final analyses. The example boundaries (on the p-values) given below 
assume the planned information fraction of 0.76 at the interim. 
Testing at the interim will proceed sequentially by comparing the interim p-values to the OBF levels, e.g. 
0.01. If the primary hypothesis cannot be rejected, then no hypothesis will be rejected, and the trial will 
proceed to the final analysis.  
For the final analysis, the nominal levels at which the remaining hypotheses can be sequentially tested 
are the OBF levels, e.g. 0.022. Sequential testing at the final analysis will proceed starting with the first 
remaining hypothesis and updating the graph with each sequential rejection until either a hypothesis fails 
to be rejected or all hypotheses are rejected.  
Subgroup analyses 
For Stage 2, analyses of MACE and the secondary CV endpoints included in the formal testing sequence 
were performed in subgroups based on region, gender, age (<65 and ≥65 years), race, ethnicity, 
category of chronic kidney disease (CKD; based on baseline eGFR: <60, 60 to <90, and ≥90 mL/min/1.73 
m2), history of heart failure, baseline HbA1c (<8.5 and ≥8.5%), baseline BMI (<30 and ≥30 kg/m2), and 
use of the following concomitant medications at baseline: statins, ezetimibe, ASA/anti-platelets, diuretics, 
beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, renin- angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, insulin, DPP-IV inhibitors, metformin, sulfonylureas, and GLP-1 
agonists. Selected subgroups (to be specified in the list of tables) was also analysed for the renal 
composite endpoint. These subgroup analyses are considered exploratory and are not adjusted for 
multiple comparisons. The same model used for the primary analysis is run within each subgroup. The 
data is also summarized descriptively by treatment group within each subgroup.

In order to provide model-based point and interval estimates of the hazard ratios for MACE and the 
endpoints in the formal testing sequence for each dose of ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg), an analysis of 
Study B1521021 was conducted using the individual dose groups. 
Sub-studies 
The primary analysis population for each sub-study was the sub-study Full Analysis Set defined as all 
subjects randomized receiving those specific background treatments at baseline, who met all sub-study 
inclusion criteria, who had received at least one dose of investigational product and had at least one 
observation of HbA1c during the time of the sub-study, including baseline and post-baseline time points 
up to Week18 inclusive.  If subjects received glycemic rescue therapy, the observations post rescue 
therapy was excluded from efficacy analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. The primary 
endpoint of HbA1c was analyzed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model with the 
following fixed effects: Treatment (categorical); Visit (categorical); Treatment by visit interaction; 
Baseline eGFR; Metformin use (yes/no; applicable for insulin (with or without metformin) sub-study only). 
This model assumed a common mean across treatment groups at baseline and a different mean for each 
treatment at each of the post-baseline time points. In this model, the response vector consisted of 
baseline and the values observed at each post-baseline time point. Time was treated as a categorical 
variable so that no restriction is imposed on the trajectory of the means over time. No explicit imputation 
of missing assessments was performed. The treatment difference in terms of mean change from baseline 
to the primary time point of Week18 was be estimated and tested from this model using least-squares 
means and 95% confidence intervals. The two-sided p-value was provided for testing the significance of 
the difference between treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses were planned to assess the robustness of 
the primary model. The two primary hypotheses, comparisons of each ertugliflozin dose to placebo, was 
tested sequentially to control the overall Type I error rate at 0.05. The 15 mg dose was tested first, and 
the 5mg dose was tested if and only if a statistically significant result is achieved for 15mg.

Summary of Major Changes 
Increased the overall sample size to approximately 8000 subjects. 
Updated assumptions to indicate that the rate of withdrawal from 
the study will be 5% per year. 
Added secondary end point of: Change in insulin dose from 
Baseline at Week 18, Week 52 and annually thereafter to the 
overall study and to the insulin with or without metformin sub-
study (at Week18 only for the sub-study). 
Added a glycaemic sub-study in subjects receiving metformin plus 
sulfonylurea (SU) at the doses specified and clarification regarding 
inclusion into this sub-study which will be done programmatically at 
the time of the analyses for all the sub-studies without changing 
the randomization scheme (only applicable to subjects enrolled 
prior to amendment). 
Modified the exclusion criterion to remove Class III heart failure as 
exclusionary. 
Added a superiority analysis for the composite endpoint of renal 
death, renal dialysis/transplant or ≥2x increase in baseline serum 
creatinine. 
All changes to the protocol were implemented prior to database lock and unblinding. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
The changes in the analysis plan made prior to database lock and unblinding were of minor importance 
for the conclusions drawn from the study. 
The statistical methods for subgroup analyses of A1C and FPG in subjects with Stage 3A CKD are not 
specified in the Non-CV SAP. The subgroup analyses were performed using 3 methods: cLDA, MI-RD, and 
return to baseline (RTB). The FAS and ER approach were used for the cLDA analysis, while the FASbase, 
defined as the FAS restricted to subjects with a baseline measurement, and IR approach were used for 
the MI-RD and RTB analyses. 
Protocol Deviations 
A total of 1148 (13.9%) of randomized subjects had at least 1 major protocol deviation. The occurrence 
of major protocol deviations was balanced across treatment groups, with 378 (13.8%) subjects in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 359 (13.1%) subjects in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 411 (15.0%) 
subjects in the placebo group reporting major protocol deviations. None of the observed protocol 
deviations were considered to have impacted the conclusions of this report. 
The most common major protocol deviation category across treatment groups was failure to conduct 
major/significant evaluations (424 [5.1%] subjects). Other common major protocol deviation categories 
were eligibility criteria not met (315 [3.8%] subjects), which was balanced across treatment groups, and 
SAEs/AEs were not reported or were not reported in timeframe per protocol (244 [3.0%] subjects). The 
inclusion of subjects that did not satisfy all entry criteria did not impact the interpretation of study 
results.

During the conduct of the study, 2 subjects were found to have simultaneously enrolled at more than 1 
site in this study and 2 subjects were found to have simultaneously enrolled in more than 1 study in the 
ertugliflozin Phase 3 program. These cases of multiple enrolments were recorded as major protocol 
deviations. 
One subject, in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, did not adhere to protocol-required guidance on 
contraception and became pregnant. This subject was discontinued from study medication. The outcome 
was reported as a healthy birth. 
A formal acknowledgment by the study team was made that deviations were reviewed and GCP 
compliance was maintained. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups (Table 1). The overall 
mean age was 64.4 years, and 11.0% of subjects were ≥ 75 years old at baseline. The majority of 
subjects (70.0%) were male, most subjects were White (87.8%), and most subjects were not Hispanic or 
Latino (87.1%). The mean BMI was 32.0 kg/m2. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
In total, the mean duration of T2DM was 13.0 years and was similar across treatment groups (Table 1). 
Background AHA therapy at screening was balanced across treatment groups with a large proportion of 
subjects receiving metformin (76.3%), insulin (47.3%), or SU (41.1%). 
Baseline A1C and FPG were similar across treatment groups with mean A1C of 8.2% and mean FPG of 
174.8 mg/dL in the total population. 
In total, mean eGFR at baseline was 76.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 and was similar across treatment groups. 
Overall, 21.5% of subjects had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Micro-
albuminuria (≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g) was present in 30.2% of subjects and macro-albuminuria (>300 
mg/g) in 9.2%. 
Baseline history of CV disease and CV risk factors were balanced across treatment groups. A total of 8187 
(99.3%) subjects had established CV disease at baseline (Table 1). 
A total of 75.9% of subjects had a history of coronary artery disease (Table 1), defined as presence of MI 
(48.0%) and/or coronary revascularization (58.1%) by CABG (22.1%), PCI (42.3%), or other (2.2%). A 
total of 22.9% of subjects had a history of cerebrovascular disease and 18.7% of subjects had a history 
of peripheral artery disease. CV risk factors were present in a majority of the population, with a history of 
hypertension in 91.2% of subjects, dyslipidaemia in 74.9% of subjects, and current or history of past 
tobacco use in 53.8% of subjects. 
A total of 21.1% of subjects had a history of stroke, and 23.7% of subjects had a history of HF. In the 
1958 subjects with HF at baseline, NYHA functional classification was collected for 1942 subjects in which 
the majority were in NYHA Functional Class I or II. 
EF data that were available prior to randomization were collected regardless of presence or absence of 
history of HF. Sites were instructed to report the EF measurement data collected closest to the date of 
randomization. EF history was collected for 5006 (60.7%) subjects: 542 (6.6%) subjects had reduced EF 
≤ 40% and 4464 (54.1%) subjects had preserved EF >40%. EF data were available for 1485 (75.8%)

subjects with a history of HF. In the HF population, 288 (14.7%) subjects had reduced EF ≤ 40% and 
1197 (61.1%) subjects had preserved EF >40%. 
Baseline lipids and blood pressure were balanced across treatment groups. The mean baseline LDL-C was 
89.1 mg/dL and the mean baseline LDL/HDL ratio was 2.1. Mean sitting systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures were 133.3 mmHg and 76.6 mmHg, respectively. 
There were no meaningful differences in the prevalence of baseline microvascular or macrovascular 
conditions across treatment groups. At baseline, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy were present 
in 28.1%, 9.3%, and 17.0% of subjects, respectively. 
History of non-traumatic amputation was present in 3.7% of subjects, in which the majority of subjects 
(2.5%) experienced toe amputation, with no meaningful differences across treatment groups. History of 
peripheral revascularization and carotid revascularization was present in 4.2% and 2.6% of subjects, 
respectively, with no meaningful differences across treatment groups. 
Other Medical Conditions at Baseline 
The most common medical history conditions by SOC were Vascular disorders (94.3%), Cardiac disorders 
(80.5%), and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (79.8%). The most common medical history conditions 
by PT were Hypertension (89.4%), Uncircumcised (49.0%), and Myocardial infarction (40.1%). There 
were no meaningful differences among treatment groups in the frequency or type of medical history 
conditions. 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Anti-Hyperglycaemic Medications 
At baseline, 8,134 (98.7%) subjects were on background AHA therapy with 50.4% of subjects taking 2 or 
more background AHAs. A total of 76.3% of subjects were taking metformin, 41.1% were taking an SU, 
47.3% were taking insulin, 11.0% were taking DPP-4, 3.4% were taking GLP-1 receptor agonists, and 
1.9% were taking thiazolidinediones. A total of 16.1% of subjects were taking 3 or more medications at 
baseline. 
Use of DPP-4 increased from baseline in the ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg groups and the placebo group 
(3.2%, 1.9%, and 3.7%, respectively). Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists increased from baseline in the 
ertugliflozin and placebo groups, although increases were slightly smaller in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 
mg groups compared to the placebo group (1.1%, 1.7%, and 2.5%, respectively). Use of SGLT2 
inhibitors was low (total of 1 subject, in the placebo group) at baseline and increased across the 
treatment groups by the final visit, although increases were slightly smaller in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 
15 mg groups compared to the placebo group (2.2%, 1.8%, and 3.0%, respectively). Use of insulin 
increased from baseline in the ertugliflozin and placebo groups, although increases were smaller in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups compared to the placebo group (4.4%, 2.6%, and 6.2%, 
respectively). Use of thiazolidinediones was similar relative to baseline in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 
mg groups and there was a small increase from baseline in the placebo group (0.2%, 0.2%, and 1.3%, 
respectively). Use of metformin, SU, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and meglitinides from baseline 
compared to the final visit was similar across treatment groups. Use of 3 or more medications increased 
from baseline in the ertugliflozin and placebo groups, although increases were smaller in the ertugliflozin 
5 mg and 15 mg groups compared to the placebo group (4.1%, 2.2%, and 6.6%, respectively). 
Cardiovascular Medications 
This trial was designed to enrol subjects on stable guideline-directed therapy. Use of therapies for 
secondary prevention at baseline was balanced across treatment groups. At baseline, 81.8% of subjects 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 31/113 
 
 
 
 
were on statins, 84.6% were on platelet aggregation inhibitors, 81.1% were on agents acting on the 
renin-angiotensin system, and 43.0% were on diuretics, including 15.2% on a loop diuretic. 
Compared to baseline, the use of calcium channel blockers, loop diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor 
antagonists had increased by the final visit in both treatment groups, although increases were slightly 
smaller in all ertugliflozin group versus placebo group: calcium channel blockers (2.1% vs 2.8%), loop 
diuretics (3.3% vs 4.6%), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (1.7% vs 2.6%). 
Compared to baseline, the use of non-loop diuretics had decreased by the final visit in all ertugliflozin 
group (1.8% decrease) and increased in the placebo group (0.7% increase). 
Other Medications 
Use of other specific prior medications was balanced across treatment groups. The most common prior 
medication categories were drugs used in diabetes (98.9%), lipid modifying agents (84.7%), agents 
acting on the renin-angiotensin system (81.5%), and aspirin (69.5%) in the Analgesics category. 
Use of other specific concomitant medications (i.e. individual medications taken by ≥ 5% of subjects in 1 
or more treatment groups during the study) was also balanced across treatment groups, the most 
common categories being drugs used in diabetes (99.3%), lipid modifying agents (89.3%), and agents 
acting on the renin-angiotensin system (85.7%). 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance 
Overall mean compliance with study medication was 96.2% and was similar across treatment groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
MACE 
The success criterion for the primary hypothesis test was met. The upper confidence limit for the MACE 
HR comparing all ertugliflozin and placebo was 1.114 (Table 8), which was below the non-inferiority 
margin of 1.3. MACE occurred in a similar percentage of subjects in all ertugliflozin group (11.89%) 
compared with the placebo group (11.91%) (HR for all ertugliflozin group vs placebo, 0.97; 95.6% CI, 
0.848 to 1.114; p<0.001 for non-inferiority). 
For the individual ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups versus placebo group, the 95.6% CIs overlapped 
(HR for the ertugliflozin 5 mg group vs placebo, 0.91; 95.6% CI, 0.773 to 1.065 and HR for the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group vs placebo, 1.04; 95.6% CI, 0.887 to 1.211).

All Ertugliflozin - includes Ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg. 
The on-treatment approach includes confirmed events that occurred between the date of the first dose of

The results for the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups were consistent with those of the all ertugliflozin 
group, with comparable Kaplan-Meier curves, and the 95.6% CIs for the individual ertugliflozin groups 
versus placebo group overlapped (Table 8). 
Results from sensitivity analyses for MACE were consistent with those from the primary analysis 
approach, indicating that the primary analysis results are robust. 
Analyses of the Composite of All-Cause Death, Non-Fatal Stroke, or Non-Fatal MI  
In the CV ITT population, results from post hoc analyses of MACE in which the CV death component was 
replaced by all-cause death (all-cause death MACE) were consistent with those using the primary 
definition of MACE. The HR for all ertugliflozin group versus the placebo group was 0.97; 95% CI; 0.867 
to 1.093. Kaplan-Meier curves and Kaplan-Meier estimates for all cause death MACE were consistent with 
those for MACE. 
Subgroup Analyses for MACE 
The subgroup analyses for MACE showed generally consistent results across all pre-specified subgroups 
as exemplified in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

Composite of CV Death or HHF 
In the CV ITT population, an estimated 12% risk reduction for all ertugliflozin group relative to the 
placebo group was observed for the composite of CV death or HHF. However, the success criterion for the 
first secondary hypothesis test for the composite of CV death or HHF was not met (HR 0.88; 95.8% CI: 
0.750 to 1.034; p=0.108) (Table 10). Hypothesis testing within the ordered testing procedure was 
therefore stopped at this step, and the remaining secondary hypotheses were not formally tested. 
P-values provided for subsequent endpoints should be considered descriptive only.

Within the composite endpoint of CV death or HHF, the evaluation of the individual components of this 
composite showed that the incidences of CV death were very similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5.56%), 15 
mg (5.53%), and placebo (5.50%) (Table 11); however, a notable difference in the incidence of HHF was 
observed in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the placebo group.

 The on-study approach includes confirmed events that occurred between the randomization date and the on-study censor date. 
Kaplan-Meier curves for time to CV death showed separation of the all ertugliflozin and placebo curves 
after approximately 1 year, which briefly converged after approximately 3.5 years, and then separated 
again after approximately 4 years.  
The most common adjudication-confirmed categories of CV death across treatment groups were sudden 
cardiac death (214 subjects [2.60%]), HF (40 subjects [0.49%]), and acute MI (35 subjects [0.42%]). 
Among these categories, the incidences of sudden cardiac death and HF death were lower in all 
ertugliflozin group (134 subjects [2.44%] and 21 subjects [0.38%], respectively) than in the placebo 
group (80 subjects [2.91%] and 19 subjects [0.69%], respectively); incidences of acute MI death were 
similar in all ertugliflozin group (25 subjects [0.45%] ) and the placebo group (10 subjects [0.36%]). 
Unexplained death (ie, cause of death was undetermined) was classified as CV death and the incidences 
were similar in all ertugliflozin group (106 [1.93%] subjects) and the placebo group (52 [1.89%] 
subjects).  
The results for the analysis of CV death and Kaplan-Meier curves for CV death were similar for the 
individual ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups.

 The on-study approach includes events that occurred between the randomization date and the on-study censor date.) 
The observed risk reduction in the primary analysis of the renal composite endpoint was primarily due to 
the lower proportion of subjects in all ertugliflozin group (3.06%) than in the placebo group (3.82%) with 
doubling of serum creatinine. In the time to first event analysis, renal dialysis/transplant occurred in a 
small percentage of subjects in all ertugliflozin group (0.13%) and placebo group (0.11%); there were no 
events of renal death.  
Kaplan-Meier curves for the renal composite endpoint showed a separation of the all ertugliflozin and

Sensitivity analyses were consistent with those from the primary analysis approach, including an analysis

Subgroup Analyses for Time to First HHF 
In a post hoc analysis, the effect of ertugliflozin on time to first HHF was consistent between the 2 
cohorts (Cohort 1 [HR 0.68; 95% CI, 0.482 to 0.949] versus Cohort 2: [HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.489 to 
1.083]). 
In a post hoc analysis of time to first HHF by baseline NYHA Class, the HR for all ertugliflozin group versus 
the placebo group was 0.48; 95% CI, 0.224 to 1.047 for NYHA Class I, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.355 to 0.927 for 
NYHA Class II, and 0.89; 95% CI, 0.350 to 2.287 for NYHA Class III.  
Results in subjects with HF at baseline and reduced EF ≤45% (rEF), preserved EF >45% (pEF), and 
unknown EF were similar. The HR for all ertugliflozin group compared with the placebo group in subjects 
with HF was 0.60; 95% CI, 0.356 to 0.996 for reduced EF ≤45%, 0.70, 95% CI; 0.391 to 1.255 for 
preserved EF >45%, and 0.52; 95% CI, 0.205 to 1.314 for unknown EF. 
Additional subgroup analyses for time to first HHF showed generally similar results across subgroups, with 
the exception of the following subgroups. Results suggested greater benefit of ertugliflozin in (1) those 
with albuminuria versus those without albuminuria at baseline, (2) those with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  
m2 versus those with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline, and (3) those taking diuretics versus those 
not taking diuretics at baseline.

Post hoc Analysis of Time to First HHF 
Analyses in the CV ITT population in which potential effect modifiers of eGFR, albuminuria, and diuretic 
use at baseline were added to the primary model provided results that were similar to the primary 
analysis approach. In this expanded model, the risk of HHF was lower in all ertugliflozin group compared 
with the placebo group (HR: 0.68; 95% CI, 0.524 to 0.877). 
Total CV Death/HHF Composite and Total HHF 
The analysis of total CV death/HHF events (i.e. not censored at the time of the first event) showed a 
reduction in total events in all ertugliflozin groups compared with the placebo group (Table 16). 
Table 16 Andersen-Gill Model for Total CV Death or HHF (CV ITT: On-Study Approach) 
A lower rate of total HHF events was observed in the ertugliflozin group compared with the placebo group 
(HR: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.561 to 0.868).

Recurrent HF Hospital Admission and Mortality in Subjects with a First HHF Event   
Recurrent hospital admission for HHF and subsequent mortality in subjects with a first HHF event were 
lower in subjects treated with ertugliflozin compared with placebo. The percentage of subjects with 
hospital readmissions for HF in all ertugliflozin group was 28.78% versus 33.33% in the placebo group. 
The percentage of subjects with subsequent CV deaths among subjects with a first HHF event in all 
ertugliflozin group was 25.90% versus 33.33 % in the placebo group.  
All-Cause Mortality 
The risk of death from any cause was not notably different between the all ertugliflozin and placebo 
groups (HR: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.797 to 1.081). Results for the individual ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg 
groups were similar. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for all-cause mortality showed a separation of the all ertugliflozin and placebo 
curves during the study, consistent with the observed HR of 0.93. 
Results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with those from the primary analysis approach. 
Other Adjudicated Efficacy Endpoints 
Other CV efficacy endpoints analyzed in VERTIS CV were time to first MACE plus, fatal or non-fatal MI, 
fatal or non-fatal stroke, HHF, and the individual components of MACE (CV death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction, non-fatal stroke).  
For each of these adjudicated efficacy endpoints, with exception of HHF, the risk was not notably different 
in all ertugliflozin group relative to the placebo group (Table 17).

Glycemic Control and Cardiometabolic Endpoints 
Data summarized in this section are for the overall FAS population in VERTIS CV. Of note, investigators or 
treating physicians were permitted to make changes in subjects’ AHA regimens after Week 18 and blood 
pressure medications at any time to maximize glucose and blood pressure control, respectively. 
Glycemic Endpoints: Reductions from baseline in A1C were greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg 
groups relative to the placebo group at Week 18 and Week 52. The mean changes from baseline in A1C 
over time showed greater reductions in the ertugliflozin groups compared with the placebo group, with

the reductions beginning at Week 6. Subsequent to Week 12, all treatment groups showed a gradual 
increase in A1C over time (Figure 11). The proportions of subjects with A1C <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) were 
greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups compared with the placebo group from Week 6 
through Month 48.

Cardiometabolic Endpoints: Reductions from baseline in BW, SBP, and DBP were greater in the 
ertugliflozin groups compared to the placebo group at Week 52. The mean changes from baseline in BW, 
SBP, and DBP over time showed greater reductions in the ertugliflozin groups compared to the placebo 
group, with the reductions beginning at Week 6 and persisting for the duration of the study (Figure 12,

Glycemic Control and Cardiometabolic Endpoints in Subjects with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney 
Disease (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2)  
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Of the 8,246 randomized subjects in VERTIS CV, 1,776 (21.5%) had Stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30 and <60 
mL/min/1.73m2). The demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects with Stage 3 CKD were 
balanced across treatment groups. The mean age was 68.1 years and 21.2% of subjects were ≥75 years 
old at baseline. The mean A1C was 8.2% and the mean eGFR was 49.3 mL/min/1.73 m2. Other diabetes 
characteristics, use of AHA therapies, and CV risk factors at baseline were balanced across treatment 
groups. 
Within the Stage 3 CKD population, 1,319 subjects had Stage 3A CKD (eGFR ≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and 457 had Stage 3B CKD (eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups within the Stage 3A CKD and 3B CKD 
subgroups. In Stage 3A CKD subgroup, the mean age was 67.7 years and 19.6% of subjects were ≥75 
years old at baseline. Mean A1C and eGFR were 8.2% and 53.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Other 
diabetes characteristics, use of AHA therapies, and CV risk factors at baseline were balanced across 
treatment groups. In CKD stage 3B subgroup, the mean age was 69.3 years and 25.8% of subjects were 
≥75 years old at baseline. Mean A1C and eGFR were 8.3% and 38.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Other 
diabetes characteristics, use of AHA therapies, and CV risk factors at baseline were balanced across 
treatment groups.  
Glycemic Control 
Glycemic Control in Subjects with Stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
In subjects with Stage 3 CKD, post hoc analyses showed that glycemic control was greater with 
ertugliflozin treatment than with placebo treatment.

 CI=Confidence Interval; LS=Least Squares; SD=Standard Deviation. 
The reductions from baseline in A1C were greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups than in the 
placebo group at all time points through Week 18. 
The model-based odds of having A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at Week 18, using multiple imputation for 
subjects with missing Week 18 data, were greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (20.7%) and 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group (17.0%) compared with the placebo group (12.9%). These results from the 
analysis of subjects with A1C <7.0% at Week 18 in which missing values were imputed as not at goal 
were consistent with the results of the primary analysis.

FPG  
At Week 18, the placebo-adjusted LS mean (95% CI) change from baseline in FPG (mg/dL) was  -7.85 
(-12.23, -3.47) for the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and -9.21 (-13.67, -4.74) for the 15 mg group. Results 
from missing data sensitivity analyses using the MI-RD and RTB approaches were consistent with those

those using the cLDA approach. 
Glycemic Control in Subjects with Stage 3B CKD (eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2)  
In subjects with CKD stage 3B, post hoc analyses showed that there was a small improvement in 
glycemic control with ertugliflozin treatment compared with placebo treatment. 
•  A1C  
The reduction from baseline in A1C at Week 18 was greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group than in the

at or after baseline). The Mean and SD for the change from baseline are based on non-missing values. 
 † Based on cLDA model with fixed effects for treatment, time, baseline eGFR (continuous) and the interaction of time by treatment. Time was 
treated as a categorical variable. 
 CI=Confidence Interval; LS=Least Squares; SD=Standard Deviation. 
The reductions from baseline in A1C were greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups than in the 
placebo group at all time points through Week 18.  
• 
FPG  
At Week 18, the placebo-adjusted LS mean (95% CI) change from baseline in FPG (mg/dL) was -5.77  
mg/dL (-14.52, 2.98) for the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and -2.35 mg/dL (-11.28, 6.58) for the ertugliflozin 
15 mg group. Results from the missing data sensitivity analysis using the RTB approach  were consistent 
with those using the cLDA approach. The MI-RD including rescue approach was not performed as the 
retrieved data were insufficient to support the analysis.

Glycemic Sub-Studies 
Insulin With or Without Metformin Add-on Glycemic Sub-Study 
A minimum of 450 subjects were expected to be enrolled in the insulin with or without metformin sub-
study. The actual sample size was 1,065.

Of the 1,065 subjects included in the insulin with or without metformin sub-study, 1045 (98.1%) 
completed the 18-week treatment period, and 979 (91.9%) completed this period on study medication. 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued study medication prior to Week 18 was generally similar 
across treatment groups.  
Baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. The 
mean age was 64.8 years, 31.8% were female, and 52.3% were ≥65 years old. At baseline, mean A1C 
and eGFR were 8.41% and 73.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The mean duration of diabetes was 16.66 
years. The median insulin dose at baseline was 58.0 units/day (Table 2: Overview of the Glycaemic Sub-
Studies in VERTIS CV). 
After 18 weeks, treatment with ertugliflozin at doses of 5 mg or 15 mg provided significant reductions 
from baseline relative to placebo in A1C and FPG (Figure 15,  
Table 21). The proportions of subjects with an A1C <7.0% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (20.7%) and 
the 15 mg group (21.1%) were approximately 2-times greater than in the placebo group (10.7%). The 
model-based odds of having A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at Week 18 using multiple imputation for 
subjects with missing Week 18 data were significantly greater with both doses of ertugliflozin compared 
with placebo (

 † cLDA model is fitted with fixed effects for treatment, time, interaction of time by treatment. Time was treated as a categorical 
variable. 
 § Logistic regression model fitted with terms for treatment and baseline A1C. For the analyses with multiple imputation, missing 
data imputed using the cLDA model fitted. 
 All model based analyses fitted with terms for baseline eGFR (continuous), stratum for insulin substudy (insulin alone or insulin + 
metformin). 
 CI=Confidence Interval; LS =Least Squares. 
After 18 weeks, treatment with both doses of ertugliflozin relative to placebo provided significant 
reductions from baseline in BW and SBP. The reductions from baseline in DBP at Week 18 were not 
significantly greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups relative to the placebo group ( 
Table 21).  
There were not enough retrieved dropouts to perform the MI-RD imputation, hence RTB was used instead 
of MI-RD for supportive analyses. Results from missing data sensitivity analysis using the RTB approach 
for change from baseline in A1C and FPG were consistent with the primary analysis results. Results from 
an analysis of subjects with A1C <7.0 % (<53 mmol/mol) at Week 18 with missing values imputed as 
‘not at goal’ were consistent with the primary analysis results. The results from missing data sensitivity 
analyses using the RTB approach for change from baseline in BW, SBP, and DBP were consistent with the 
primary analysis results. 
SU Monotherapy Add-on Glycemic Sub-Study 
The planned sample size for this sub-study was 170 subjects; however, the actual sample size was 157. 
Of the 157 subjects included in the SU monotherapy sub-study, 155 (98.7%) completed the 18-week 
treatment period, and 148 (94.3%) completed this period on study medication. The proportion of

subjects who discontinued study medication prior to Week 18 was low with a higher number in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group.  
Baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics were balanced across treatment groups for 
most categories. A majority of subjects for the total population (61.8%) were male, although the 
proportion was lower within the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (44.4% male). The mean age was 64.6 years, 
and 49.7% were ≥65 years old. At baseline, mean A1C and eGFR were 8.29% and 77.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
respectively. The mean duration of diabetes was 8.48 years. The most commonly used SU was gliclazide 
with a median dose of 60.0 mg/day at randomization (Table 2). 
After 18 weeks, reductions from baseline in A1C were not significantly different between the ertugliflozin 
and placebo groups (Figure 16,  
Table 22). Hence, all p-values for the comparison of ertugliflozin 5 mg compared to placebo for A1C, 
and for both 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin groups compared to the placebo group for FPG, BW, proportion 
of subjects with A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), SBP and DBP were considered descriptive only ( 
Table 22). The reductions from baseline in FPG at Week 18 were greater with both doses of ertugliflozin 
relative to placebo. The proportion of subjects with an A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at Week 18 was not 
notably different across the treatment groups (ertugliflozin 5 mg: 32.7%, ertugliflozin 15 mg: 27.8 %, 
placebo: 25 %) (

Metformin with SU Add-on Glycemic Sub-Study 
It was expected that a minimum of 260 subjects would be enrolled into the sub-study. The actual sample 
size was 330 subjects. 
Among the 330 subjects, 328 (99.4%) completed the 18-week treatment period, and 313 (94.8%) 
completed this period on study medication. The proportion of subjects who discontinued study medication 
prior to Week 18 was generally similar across treatment groups.  
Baseline demographic and anthropometric characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. The 
mean age was 63.2 years, 25.2% were female, and 44.5% were ≥65 years old. At baseline, mean A1C 
and eGFR were 8.32% and 83.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The mean duration of diabetes was 11.41

years. The median metformin dose at baseline was 2000.0 mg/day. The most commonly used SU was 
gliclazide with a median dose of 90.0 mg/day at randomization (Table 2). 
After 18 weeks, treatment with both doses of ertugliflozin relative to placebo provided significant 
reductions from baseline in A1C and FPG (Figure 17,  
Table 23). The proportions of subjects with an A1C <7.0% at Week 18 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group 
(37.0%) and the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (32.7%) were almost 3 times greater than in the placebo 
group (12.8%). The model-based odds of having A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at Week 18 using multiple 
imputation for subjects with missing Week 18 data were significantly greater in both ertugliflozin groups 
compared with the placebo group ( 
Table 23).

 n is the number of subjects with the event of interest. 
 † cLDA model is fitted with fixed effects for treatment, time, interaction of time by treatment. Time was treated as a categorical 
variable. 
 § Logistic regression model fitted with terms for treatment and baseline A1C. For the analyses with multiple imputation, missing 
data imputed using the cLDA model fitted. 
 All model based analyses fitted with terms for baseline eGFR (continuous). 
 CI=Confidence Interval; LS =Least Squares. 
After 18 weeks, treatment with both doses of ertugliflozin relative to placebo provided significant 
reductions from baseline in BW. The reduction from baseline in SBP at Week 18 was not significantly 
greater in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group relative to the placebo group ( 
Table 23). Hypothesis testing within the ordered testing procedure was therefore stopped at this step, 
and the remaining secondary hypotheses were not formally tested. P-values provided for subsequent 
endpoints are descriptive and should not be interpreted as formal hypothesis tests. The reductions from 
baseline in SBP at Week 18 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and in DBP at Week 18 for both ertugliflozin 
groups were not greater relative to the placebo group ( 
Table 23).  
There were not enough retrieved dropouts to perform the MI-RD imputation, so RTB was used instead of 
MI-RD for all secondary analysis. Results from missing data sensitivity analyses using the RTB approach 
for change from baseline in A1C and FPG were consistent with the primary analysis results. Results from 
an analysis of subjects with A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) at Week 18 with missing values imputed as ‘not 
at goal’ were consistent with the primary analysis results. Additionally, the results from missing data 
sensitivity analyses using the RTB approach for change from baseline in BW, SBP, and DBP were 
consistent with the primary analysis results.

Data in patients with renal impairment are presented in relation to the main study. 
3.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The VERTIS CV study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
event-driven study that included a main CV study. This study was intended to address two overarching 
objectives: 1) CV safety (non-inferiority) and 2) CV and renal efficacy (superiority).  
The study included three glycaemic sub-studies, investigating treatment combinations not previously 
studied in the clinical development programme, add-on to: 1) insulin with or without metformin, 2) SU 
monotherapy and 3) metformin with SU.  
The general study design is adequate. The doses of ertugliflozin evaluated in this study were 5 mg and 15 
mg qd. At the time of the initiation of the study, ertugliflozin was not yet approved, and the doses used in 
the study were selected based on Phase 1 and Phase 2 study data. Thus, as opposed to the current 
posology, which states that treatment should be initiated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, one group was assigned 
to a starting dose of 15 mg. Anti-hyperglycaemic background treatment was to be kept unchanged for 
the first 18 weeks of the study to allow assessment of the anti-hyperglycaemic effect of ertugliflozin in 
the three glycaemic sub-studies. To safeguard the patients, rescue medication was allowed, and rescue

criteria were in place. Background medications for secondary prevention of CV disease was to be provided 
in line with applicable treatment guidelines and could be changed as needed during the study. 
The study duration of the glycaemic sub-studies was 18 weeks which, as pointed out in the scientific 
advice (SA) given, is somewhat short for the assessment of efficacy. No further data has been provided 
on the sub-studies. 
Inclusion criteria were adequate for patients at high CV risk and in need for additional anti-
hyperglycaemic treatment. Treatment with rosiglitazone, which may have a potentially negative effect on 
CV safety was not allowed. After the amendment of the protocol (see below), patients with HF, NYHA 
Class III could be included in the study. Other exclusion criteria were adequate for patients where 
assessment may be affected by unstable disease, or where treatment with ertugliflozin may not be safe.  
The primary endpoint (MACE) includes CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, which is adequate for 
assessing the primary objective. With the amendment, the key secondary endpoints were changed to 
include time to first occurrence of the composite of CV death or HHF. The key secondary endpoints also 
include renal outcomes in terms of renal death, renal dialysis/transplant, or ≥2 × increase in baseline 
serum creatinine. In addition, secondary endpoints related to glycaemic control and renal function were 
included. 
The statistical analysis plan for the study was acceptable. The primary endpoint was evaluated, according 
to plan in SAP, using the pooled data from the two active treatment arms. The Stage 2 assessment of CV 
data for ertugliflozin included an interim analysis and a final analysis. The Stage 2 interim analysis was 
performed after the requisite number of adjudicated MACE and CV death events accrued in the study. The 
study continued after the interim analysis because early stopping criteria were not met. The type 1-error 
was controlled for the interim analysis, the primary non-inferiority analysis and 3 secondary analyses. 
Several sensitivity analyses were planned and performed for the analysis of primary and secondary 
endpoints, these included multiple imputation methods based on retrieved drop-outs within treatment 
group and a tipping point analysis. All sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.   
Only one amendment of the protocol was made, due to the publication of CV outcome data for another 
SGLT2-inhibitor, empagliflozin. With this amendment the superiority analysis of the new secondary 
endpoint of CV death or hospitalisation for heart failure was included and the overall sample size was 
increased to 8,000 subjects. A superiority analysis for the composite renal endpoint was also added. In 
addition, the third glycaemic sub-study in subjects receiving metformin plus sulfonylurea (SU) was added. 
With this amendment, patients with NYHA Class III heart failure could be enrolled in the study.  
The study appears to have been well conducted. Protocol deviations were recorded for 13.9% of patients, 
and the reporting was balanced between groups. The observed protocol deviations are not considered to 
have impacted the outcome and conclusions of the study. Overall, only eight patients (2 in the placebo 
treated group and 6 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group) were excluded from the CV ITT population. 
Baseline data 
In total 8,246 patients were randomised in the study with 2,752 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 
2,747 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 2,747 subjects in the placebo group. The number of patients 
who discontinued the study was low (4%) and evenly distributed between the treatment groups. In 
addition, vital status was available for the majority of discontinued patients. About 30% of patients 
discontinued study treatment, the proportion being somewhat higher in the placebo treated group 
(placebo 32.7% and 28.1/28.5% for ertugliflozin 5/15 mg). The reasons for treatment discontinuation 
were largely balanced between groups. 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between groups. The majority of 
patients (56.2%) were recruited in Europe. The characteristics were as expected in a T2DM population at

high cardiovascular risk. The study managed to include 139 patients in NYHA Class III after the 
amendment. Notably, 76.3% of subjects were taking metformin, whereas only 11% were taking DPP-4 
inhibitors. Thus, the data are relevant for both Steglatro (ertugliflozin) and Segluromet (ertugliflozin + 
metformin). The use of DPP-4, GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i, insulin, thiazolidinediones increased from baseline but 
less in the ertugliflozin treated groups compared to placebo. Use of metformin, SU, alpha glucosidase 
inhibitors, and meglitinides remained stable throughout the study. 
The patients were to be treated according to current treatment guidelines with regards to cardiovascular 
medications. The use of statins, platelets aggregation inhibitors and agents acting on the renin-
angiotensin system was high (>80% of patients). About 40% were on diuretics including 15% who were 
on loop diuretics. The treatment compliance was high (96.2%) and similar across treatment groups. 
In conclusion, the study population is considered representative for the target population of T2DM 
patients. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Cardiovascular safety 
The study met its primary endpoint as non-inferiority for MACE was shown for the “All ertugliflozin” group 
(HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.848, 1.114). Non-inferiority was also shown for each of the two doses (5 mg and 15 
mg) but it is noted that the HR for the higher dose was 1.04 compared to 0.91 for the lower dose. No 
meaningful differences were observed for the components of MACE compared to placebo. Notably, MACE 
and the components non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke was reported at numerically higher rates in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg treated group compared to ertugliflozin 5 mg and placebo. The Kaplan-Meier curves 
separated slightly after about 6 months but converged again after about three years. 
A post-hoc analysis was conducted, where the CV death component of MACE was replaced by “All-cause 
death”, which showed a comparable HR (0.97; 95% CI: 0.867 to 1.093) as for the primary analysis.  
The subgroup analysis generally showed consistent findings across the subgroups. Although point 
estimates for the HR varied somewhat, the 95% CI was within the non-inferiority margin also for all large 
subgroups. The most notable exceptions are in patients with eGFR < 60 (HR 1.09; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.40) 
and history of heart failure (HR 1.05; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.35). 
Superiority was however not shown for the key secondary endpoint “CV death or HHF” (HR 0.88; 95% CI: 
0.750, 1.034). Hypothesis testing was therefore stopped at this step. The outcome was comparable when 
“CV death” was exchanged by “All-cause death or HHF” (HR: 0.90; 95.8% CI; 0.776 to 1.032). The 
findings were consistent across subgroups, the only subgroups where the point estimate was higher than 
1 were patients with GFR >90 and patients on diuretics. The secondary endpoint “total CV death/HHF 
events” (i.e. not censored at the time of the first event), showed a reduction in the total number of 
events (HR 0.82 95% CI 0.716, 0945) which is lower than for the endpoint “CV death or HHF”. 
“CV death” was analysed separately as a secondary endpoint. There was no noticeable difference between 
treatment groups (HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.767, 1.113). Only small differences in the pattern of the cause of 
death were observed, with slightly lower reporting of “sudden cardiac death” and “HF death” in the 
ertugliflozin groups, whereas “acute MI death” and “unexplained death” were reported at similar rates in 
all groups. A comparable outcome was observed for the secondary endpoint "All-cause death” (HR: 0.93; 
95% CI, 0.797 to 1.081). 
The secondary endpoint “time to first HHF” was not subject to hypothesis testing but the analysis showed 
a 30% reduction of the risk with a CI excluding 1 (HR 0.70; 95% CI:0.539, 0.902). Comparable 
outcomes were observed for both doses (HR 0.71 and 0.68 for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively).

Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. The Kaplan-Meier curves separated early 
and the separation continued for the duration of the study. The subgroup analysis indicated that patients 
with albuminuria, patients with lower GFR and patients not using diuretics may have a greater benefit. 
The data was further supported by the analysis of recurrent HF hospital admissions and mortality in 
subjects with a first HHF event, which was lower in the ertugliflozin treated groups compared to placebo. 
Although this endpoint was not subject to formal hypothesis testing, these data are considered of interest 
for the prescriber, and are included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Other CV efficacy endpoints analyzed in VERTIS CV were time to first MACE+, fatal or non-fatal MI, fatal 
or non-fatal stroke and HHF. Apart from a reduction of the risk of HHF, no differences were observed 
between the ertugliflozin treated groups and placebo. It is noted that the observed rates for these 
endpoints were numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 15 mg treated group compared to both ertugliflozin 
5 mg and placebo. However, none of these outcomes are statistically different to placebo.  
In summary, the data on CV safety and efficacy show that treatment with ertugliflozin does not carry an 
increased risk of CV events and there appears to be a beneficial effect in reducing the risk of HHF. These 
findings are in line with the outcome of other CV outcome trials conducted with some other SGLT2 
inhibitors. The data is considered sufficient to allow an update of the indication. The outcome, including 
the data on HHF, is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Composite of renal events 
No formal testing of the composite “renal events” was performed, but it is noted that the 19% reduction 
of events in the ertugliflozin treated groups was not statistically significant since the CI includes 1 (HR 
0.81; 95% CI: 0.630, 1.036). The Kaplan-Meier curve show a separation of the curves over time. The 
potentially reduced risk is mainly driven by an effect on GFR, whereas other components of the composite 
endpoint were rare and balanced between groups. The MAH argues that sustained 40% decrease from 
baseline in eGFR is a more relevant endpoint than doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and points 
out that this endpoint has been used in studies with other SGLT2i. This is acknowledged.  
The MAH has conducted a pre-specified exploratory analysis using the endpoint “sustained 40% decrease 
from baseline in eGFR” instead of “doubling of creatinine” which shows a lower event rate (events per 100 
person-years) in the ertugliflozin group compared with placebo (0.60 vs 0.90), with an HR (95% CI) of 
0.66 (0.50, 0.88), with consistent findings across baseline kidney function subgroups. This is in line with 
data for other SGLT2-inhibitors in studies where this endpoint was applied.  
Thus, the data are reassuring with regards to the effects of ertugliflozin on renal function, but no claims 
regarding this effect can yet be made.    
Glycaemic control and cardiometabolic endpoints  
In the study, beneficial effects on HbA1c, body weight and blood pressure were observed with 
ertugliflozin treatment. The changes observed at week 18, after which the anti-hyperglycaemic treatment 
could be adjusted, were of comparable magnitude as observed in previous clinical studies with 
ertugliflozin. 
Use in patients with renal impairment 
The efficacy of ertugliflozin was investigated in order to provide support for a lowering of the limits for 
treatment initiation and discontinuation. In the VERTIS CV study, 21.5% of the subjects (1 776 patients) 
had an eGFR 30 – 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline (Stage 3 CKD). This subgroup was older than the 
overall population (68.1 years vs 64.4 years), but with comparable metabolic control. Of these patients, 
1 319 were in Stage 3A (eGFR 45-60) and 457 were in Stage 3B (eGFR 30-45).  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 61/113 
 
 
 
 
In the overall Stage 3 CKD population, ertugliflozin treatment resulted in a modest decrease in HbA1c of 
0.27% (5 mg dose) and 0.28% (15 mg dose), in line with the data from the dedicated study in patients 
with Stage 3 CKD assessed in the MAA. In contrast to the previous study, no increase is observed with 
increasing dose. The calculated odds of achieving HbA1c <7.0% was higher with ertugliflozin (20.7% and 
17.0% for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively) compared to placebo (12.9%), but still modest. 
Statistically significant reductions of FPG were observed for both doses.  
Comparable results were observed for the Stage 3A CKD subgroup (GFR 45-60), where a reduction of 
0.27% (5 mg dose) and 0.31% (15 mg dose) was observed, whereas the effect on HbA1c was further 
attenuated in the subgroup with Stage 3B CKD subgroup (GFR 30-45) with no statistically significant 
difference observed with the 15 mg dose compared to placebo. 
A similar pattern was observed with regards to the effect on body weight and SBP. In the overall Stage 3 
CKD subgroup (GFR 30-60), reductions in BW and SBP were more pronounced with ertugliflozin 
treatment than with placebo treatment but the effect on body weight appears attenuated compared to 
the overall study population. The outcome in the Stage 3A CKD subgroup (GFR 45-60) compared well 
with the outcome in the overall Stage 3 CKD population but the effect (especially on SBP) was attenuated 
in the Stage 3B CKD subgroup (GFR 30-45). 
The MAH proposes to lower the limit for initiation of ertugliflozin treatment to eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and to allow treatment down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The MAH has summarised the data for 
the stage 3 CKD subgroup with eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73m2. The data indicate that eGFR is maintained 
with long-term treatment. Apart from any potential beneficial effect of maintained eGFR per se, this 
indicates that treatment could be maintained for a relevant period of time also in the population with 
eGFR 30-45. The data presented indicate that the potential beneficial effects observed on renal function 
and HHF are present also in the stage 3 CKD subgroup. It should however be noted that these data are 
descriptive since formal testing was not performed for these endpoints. However, the data for ertugliflozin 
is well in line with outcomes observed for other SGLT2i, which indicates that the observed benefits are 
due to class effects on renal function and on HHF.  
The effects of ertugliflozin on SBP and body weight were largely comparable for patients with stage 3 CKD 
and the overall population whereas the effect on glycaemic control in patients with eGFR 30-45 is clearly 
attenuated (about -0.2% to -0.3%, placebo adjusted).  
In summary, the MAH has provided sufficient data supporting that patients with eGFR 30-60 have 
additional benefits in terms of preservation of renal function and a reduced risk of HHF with ertugliflozin 
treatment, which outweigh the loss of glycaemic effects in this population. The findings are line with the 
observations made for other products in the class of SGLT2i. No safety concerns arise from the data 
presented for patients with eGFR 30-60. Therefore, initiation of treatment with Steglatro in patients with 
eGFR<45 and continuation of ertugliflozin treatment in patients with eGFR>30 is accepted. The proposed 
wording for section 4.2 is accepted. 
Glycaemic sub-studies 
The MAH has provided data on three sub-studies included in the VERTIS CV study, in order to support 
wording on combinations with ertugliflozin not previously studied to be included in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. The studies have been discussed in previous CHMP SA and the main issue raised was the short 
duration of the sub-studies (18 weeks). Concerns were also raised that the population included in the 
VERTIS CV study may not be representative for the target population. It is noted that the population in 
the sub-studies are older, had a longer duration of T2DM and a lower eGFR than the patients included in 
the studies supporting the MAA but had comparable HbA1c and BMI at inclusion. The lower eGFR could 
affect the glycaemic outcome, but it is still considered possible to generalise the findings to the target 
population of T2DM.

Add-on to insulin with or without metformin 
The study included 348 patients on ertugliflozin 5 mg, 370 patients on ertugliflozin 15 mg and 347 
patients on placebo. When added to a background therapy of insulin with or without metformin, 
ertugliflozin resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically significant decrease in HbA1c of -0.58% with 
the 5 mg dose and -0.65% with the 15 mg dose (placebo-adjusted). Statistically significant decreases in 
FPG were also observed and the proportion of patients achieving the target of HbA1c <7.0% were twice 
as high (20.7% and 21.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively, vs 10.7% for placebo). A 
placebo-adjusted decrease in body weight of -1.62 kg (5 mg dose) and -1.88 kg (15 mg dose) was also 
observed. A statistically significant reduction of SBP vs placebo was observed whereas the decrease in 
DBP did not reach statistical significance.  
The duration of the study was however considered too short. The MAH has therefore conducted a post-
hoc analysis, including data on all patients in the VERTIS CV study who were taking insulin at baseline, 
irrespective of the insulin dose as opposed to the sub-study in which only patients with an insulin dose of 
≥20 U/day. The new analysis includes a larger number of patients (placebo=1337, ertugliflozin 5 
mg=1298, and ertugliflozin 15 mg=1243) compared to 1065 patients in the sub study. 
The data show that the additive effect on glycaemic control is maintained at least up to month 48. Insulin 
doses remained essentially stable in the ertugliflozin treated groups whereas the insulin dose slowly 
increased in placebo treated patients. Slightly more patients in the ertugliflozin treated groups 
discontinued insulin treatment during the study and more patients in the placebo treated group received 
additional treatment with other AHAs. 
Considering that a clinically relevant effect on glycaemic endpoints is shown, which is of the same 
magnitude as observed with other products in the class with this combination, it is acceptable to include 
this information in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Add-on to SU monotherapy 
Monotherapy with SU in longstanding T2DM is uncommon and the study failed to recruit more than 157 
patients, i.e. less than the target of 170 patients. The primary endpoint of the study was not met as the 
placebo-adjusted change in HbA1c was only -0.35% with the 5 mg dose and -0.22% with the 15 mg 
dose. This is explained by a higher than expected effect in the placebo treated group of -0.56% reduction 
in HbA1c, as compared to a HbA1c reduction of about -0.2% in the overall placebo treated group. The 
effect on body weight was also modest (placebo-adjusted: -1.07 kg and -0.52 kg for the 5 mg and 15 mg 
dose, respectively), and SBP and DBP increased compared to placebo. The MAH has not proposed to 
include these data in section 5.1 of the SmPC, which is endorsed.   
Add-on to metformin and SU 
This sub-study included 100 patients on ertugliflozin 5 mg, 113 patients on ertugliflozin 15 mg and 117 
patients on placebo. When added to metformin and SU, ertugliflozin resulted in a clinically relevant and 
statistically significant decrease in HbA1c of -0.66% with the 5 mg dose and -0.75% with the 15 mg dose 
(placebo-adjusted). Statistically significant decreases in FPG were also observed and the proportion of 
patients achieving the target of HbA1c <7.0% were almost three times as high (37.0% and 32.7% for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively, vs 12.8% for placebo). A placebo-adjusted decrease in body 
weight of -1.57 kg (5 mg dose) and -1.94 kg (15 mg dose) was also observed. Only modest reductions of 
SBP and DBP vs placebo were observed, none of which reached statistical significance.  
The study duration of 18 weeks was however considered too short. Therefore, the MAH has provided a 
post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of ertugliflozin over 52 weeks (when added to metformin and SU), The 
data show that the HbA1c-lowering effect is maintained up to 52 weeks.

Again, considering that a clinically relevant effect on glycaemic endpoints is shown, which is of the same 
magnitude as observed with other products in the class with this combination, it is acceptable to include 
this information in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
3.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CV outcome data from the VERTIS CV study showed that ertugliflozin is not associated with an 
unacceptable increase in CV risk, as non-inferiority to placebo has been demonstrated. A reduction of 
hospitalization due to heart failure was observed. These data are reflected in the SmPC. These data are 
also deemed sufficient to allow an update of the wording of the indication for both Steglatro and 
Segluromet.  
Also, the data provided in patients with Stage 3 CKD is deemed sufficient to allow the proposed changes 
to the recommendations on treatment initiation and discontinuations based on eGFR. 
In addition, the data on add-on to 1) insulin with or without metformin, and 2) metformin with SU, 
showed clinically relevant effects with ertugliflozin treatment and these data should be reflected in the 
SmPC. 
3.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The current safety evaluation is based on data from the completed VERTIS CV study. The VERTIS CV also 
included three glycaemic sub-studies defined by background AHA therapy (insulin with or without 
metformin, SU monotherapy, and metformin with SU) and a prespecified assessment of glycaemic 
efficacy in the subgroup of subjects with Stage 3A CKD (eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
The target population were patients with T2DM and established CV disease. 
Patient exposure 
The VERTIS CV safety population included 8,238 patients, 2,746 on ertugliflozin 5 mg, 2,747 on 
ertugliflozin 15 mg and 2,745 on placebo.  
Duration of exposure 
The mean duration on treatment was 150.94 weeks: 152.96 weeks in all ertugliflozin group and 146.91 
weeks in the placebo group (Table 25). The mean duration on study was 181.77 weeks and was similar 
across treatment groups.

Adverse events of special interest 
Hypovolemia 
The incidences of AEs of hypovolemia are presented in Table 30.  
AEs of hypovolemia led to discontinuation of study medication in 7 (0.3%) subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 
mg group, 2 (0.1%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 1 (0.0%) in the placebo group. Twenty-seven 
(1.0%) subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 24 (0.9%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 28 
(1.0%) in the placebo group had an SAE of hypovolemia. Hypovolemia AEs led to death in 3 (0.3%)

subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 3 (0.3%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and none in the 
placebo group. Three of these 6 subjects died from cardiac events leading to circulatory collapse. Two of 
these subjects had a fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and 1 subject died of hypovolemic shock in the 
context of “cardiac events” per investigator. None of these events were assessed as related to study 
medication by the investigator.

In males, there were 6 (0.3%) subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 5 (0.3%) in the 15 mg group, and 
none in the placebo group who discontinued study medication due to a GMI AE. In females, there were 6 
(0.8%) subjects in the 5 mg ertugliflozin group, 4 (0.5%) in the 15 mg ertugliflozin group, and none in 
the placebo group who discontinued study medication due to a GMI AE. No GMI AEs were serious. 
Complicated genital infections 
“Complicated” genital infections were defined as SAEs within the GMI CMQ or AEs within the Sponsor-
generated CMQ of potentially medically significant genital infections].  
In male subjects, the incidence of complicated genital infection AEs was low overall, but higher in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg (1.0%) and 15 mg groups (0.9%) than in the placebo group (0.3%). Phimosis was 
reported in 33 cases (0.9%) for ertugliflozin compared to 2 cases (0.1%) for placebo. In female subjects, 
incidences of complicated genital infection AEs were low in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.4%) and 15 mg 
(0.4%) groups. There were no complicated genital infection AEs in female subjects in the placebo group.  
Fournier’s gangrene 
No event of Fournier’s Gangrene was identified. 
There were 4 subjects with AEs of skin necrosis or gas gangrene, 2 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 2 
in the placebo group. The AEs for all 4 subjects involved the lower limb.

Urinary tract infection 
The incidences of UTI AEs were higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (12.2%) and 15 mg (12.0%) groups than 
in the placebo group (10.2%). The incidences of UTI SAEs were low and not notably different across 
treatment groups, with 25 (0.9%) subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 12 (0.4%) in the ertugliflozin 
15 mg group, and 22 (0.8%) in the placebo group. 
Complicated urinary tract infection 
“Complicated” UTI AEs were defined as SAEs within the UTI CMQ or AEs within the Sponsor-generated 
CMQ of potentially medically significant events. 
The incidences of complicated UTI AEs were low and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (1.5%), 15 mg 
(0.7%), and placebo groups (1.1%).  
Ketoacidosis 
Based on internal case review, the percentages of subjects with events meeting the case definition for 
ketoacidosis (with certain, probable, or possible likelihood) were higher in the ertugliflozin groups than in 
the placebo group in both the APRFU dataset (Table 33) and the Treatment Period dataset. The 
percentages of subjects with events meeting the case definition for ketoacidosis with certain, probable, or 
possible likelihood was higher in all ertugliflozin group (19 subjects [0.3%]) than in the placebo group (2 
subjects [0.1%]). There were no fatal cases of ketoacidosis during the Treatment Period. One subject, in 
the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, had a fatal AE of diabetic ketoacidosis that began 310 days after the 
subject’s last dose of study medication.

Figure 18 Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to First Amputation All Subjects as Treated All Post-
randomization Follow-up 
Based on the multivariate model for the APRFU, the following factors were associated (p<0.05) with 
increased risk for amputation: male gender, history of peripheral arterial disease, history of amputation 
or peripheral revascularization, higher baseline A1C (%), history of diabetic foot, diuretic use at baseline, 
and insulin use at baseline.  
The distribution of subjects with and without amputations according to baseline risk factors for 
amputation was generally consistent with the multivariate model findings. Subjects with amputations 
were more likely to be male, have higher A1C (%) at baseline, have a history of peripheral neuropathy, 
peripheral arterial disease, amputation, diabetic foot, diabetic retinopathy, and to have been taking 
diuretics (including loop diuretics) at baseline, and to have been taking insulin at baseline.  
Peripheral revascularization 
The incidences of peripheral revascularization were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (1.8%), 15 mg 
(2.0%), and placebo (2.4%) groups. The follow-up time-adjusted incidence rates of peripheral 
revascularization per 100-subject years were low and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.53), 15 mg 
(0.58), and placebo (0.70) groups.  
Fractures 
The most common category of confirmed fracture in subjects with at least 1 fracture was low-trauma 
fracture across treatment groups. The incidences of adjudication-confirmed fractures were similar in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.6%), 15 mg (3.7%), and placebo (3.6%) groups (Table 37).

Laboratory Data Related to Bone Metabolism 
Subjects treated with ertugliflozin had small increases in mean phosphate and magnesium starting at 
Week 6 relative to subjects treated with placebo. Mean calcium values remained similar over time across 
all treatment groups.

Initial reductions in eGFR (MDRD formula) were observed in all treatment groups with subsequent 
increases in the ertugliflozin groups until Week 52, at which time the mean change (mL/min/1.73 m2) 
from baseline was -0.4 and -1.1 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups, respectively, and -0.2 in the 
placebo group (Figure 19). At Month 60, the mean changes from baseline in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 
mg groups (-2.4 and -2.9, respectively) were smaller compared with the placebo group (-6.8). The 
increase towards baseline in the eGFR observed after Month 60 in the ertugliflozin and placebo groups 
may be an artifact of the low numbers of subjects at the later timepoints. 
The proportions of subjects with at least 1 occurrence of a decrease >30% from baseline in eGFR were 
similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (17.2%), 15 mg (18.2%) and placebo (17.6%) groups. The proportions of 
subjects with at least 1 decrease >50% from baseline in eGFR were lower in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group 
(2.2%) and similar in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (2.8%), relative to the placebo group (3.3%). 
The proportions of subjects with a decrease >30% from baseline in eGFR at their last on-treatment 
assessment was similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (6.6%), 15 mg (6.6%), and placebo (7.8%) groups. The 
proportions of subjects with a decrease from baseline >50% at their last on-treatment assessment were 
low and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (1.0%), 15 mg (1.0%), and placebo (1.4%) groups.

Renal-related AEs 
The incidences of renal-related AEs were not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (4.2%), 15 mg 
(4.3%), and placebo (4.7%) groups. Incidences of AEs related to decreased eGFR or increased creatinine 
were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (2.1%), 15 mg (3.4%), and placebo (2.4%) groups.  
No renal-related events meeting adjudication criteria were adjudicated as very likely or probably related 
to study medication, and the numbers of events adjudicated as possibly related to study medication were 
lower in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (6 events) and 15 mg (9 events) groups than in the placebo (19 events) 
group.

Urinary albumin: creatinine ratio 
Median percent increases in UACR (urinary albumin: creatinine ratio) over time were smaller in the 
ertugliflozin groups than in the placebo group (Table 39). Additionally, the proportions of subjects with 
albuminuria regression (i.e, improvement from micro- to normo-albuminuria or from macro- to micro- or 
normo-albuminuria) were higher and the proportions of subjects with albuminuria progression (i.e, 
deterioration from normo- to micro- or macro- albuminuria, or from micro- to macro-albuminuria) were 
lower in the ertugliflozin groups compared with the placebo group (Table 40).

Hypoglycaemia 
Sub-studies 
Background antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs) were to be kept constant during the first 18 weeks of the 
study unless glycemic rescue was needed, or subjects experienced clinically significant hypoglycemia. 
After Week 18, subjects were to receive standard of care for glycemic control.  
Through Week 18 in the insulin with or without metformin sub-study, the incidences of symptomatic 
hypoglycemia were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (26.4%), 15 mg (26.5%), and placebo (28.5%) 
groups. The incidences of documented hypoglycemia (symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) were 
similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (39.4%), 15 mg (38.9%), and placebo (37.5%) groups. 
Through Week 18 in the SU monotherapy sub-study, all episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred 
in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5.5%) and 15 mg (3.7%) groups. The incidences of documented hypoglycemia 
(symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) were 7.3% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 9.3% in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 4.2% in the placebo group. There were no incidences of severe 
hypoglycemia. 
Through Week 18 in the metformin with SU sub-study, the incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 
similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (11.0%), 15 mg (12.4%), and placebo (7.7%) groups. The incidences of 
documented hypoglycemia (symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) were higher in the ertugliflozin 15 
mg group (26.5%) than in the placebo group (14.5%); the incidences of documented hypoglycemia 
(symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (20.0%) and placebo 
groups. The incidences of severe hypoglycemia were low in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (2.0%), 15 mg (1.8%), 
and placebo (0.9%) groups. 
Main study 
In the Treatment Period of the VERTIS CV main study, the incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 
not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (28.0%), 15 mg (26.5%), and placebo (28.8%) groups. The 
incidences of documented hypoglycemia (symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) were similar in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg (45.0%), 15 mg (44.4%), and placebo (44.3%) groups. The incidences of severe 
hypoglycemia were low and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5.0%), 15 mg (5.4%), and placebo (5.9%) 
groups.

Pancreatitis 
The numbers of subjects with adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events were low and similar in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.4%), 15 mg (0.2%), and placebo (0.4%) groups. 
Hepatic events 
No hepatic events submitted for adjudication were adjudicated as very likely or probably related to study 
medication in the ertugliflozin groups compared with 1 event in each of these causality categories in the 
placebo group. There were 6 subjects with hepatic events (each subject had 1 event) adjudicated as 
possibly related to study medication in each treatment group. 
Small mean decreases from baseline in ALT and AST were observed over time in the ertugliflozin and 
placebo groups.  
In the standard PDLC analysis, there were 3 subjects (0.1%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 2 (0.1%) in 
the 15 mg group, and none in the placebo group with ALT or AST values >20 X ULN at any visit. In a post 
hoc analysis based on local and core laboratory results combined, the proportions of subjects meeting this

PDLC criterion were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5 subjects [0.2%]), 15 mg (6 subjects [0.2%]), and 
placebo (3 subjects [0.1%]) groups. 
In the standard PDLC analysis, 1 subject (0.0%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 2 (0.1%) in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 3 (0.1%) in the placebo group had an ALT or AST value ≥3 X ULN with a 
concurrent bilirubin value >2 X ULN at any visit. In a post hoc analysis based on local and core laboratory 
results combined, the proportions of subjects meeting this PDLC criterion were not notably different 
between the ertugliflozin 5 mg (4 subjects [0.1%]), 15 mg (4 subjects [0.1%]), and placebo (9 subjects 
[0.3%]) groups. 
Hypersensitivity 
The incidences of potential hypersensitivity events were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (4.4%), 15 mg 
(5.2%), and placebo groups (4.4%). The incidences of serious potential hypersensitivity AEs were low 
and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.3%), 15 mg (0.3%), and placebo (0.4%) groups.  
Malignancy 
Malignancies were assessed via analyses of neoplasm AEs of malignant or unspecified potential (MedDRA 
SMQ Malignant or unspecified tumours). The overall incidences of these AEs in the APRFU dataset were 
similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5.9%), 15 mg (5.5%), and placebo (5.5%) groups. Follow-up time-
adjusted incidence rates of per 100-subject years were also similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (1.7), 15 mg 
(1.6), and placebo (1.6) groups. Similar results were observed in analyses of these AEs with onset >180 
days after first dose of study medication in subjects treated for >6 months (180 days).  
An evaluation of AEs within the high-level group term of renal and urinary tract neoplasms malignant and 
unspecified showed that bladder and kidney neoplasms were more common in the ertugliflozin groups 
than in the placebo group (Table 42).

Within the HLGT renal and urinary tract neoplasms malignant and unspecified, all events were either 
renal or bladder neoplasms. One subject in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group reported both a renal and a 
bladder malignancy. Smoking is a major risk factor for bladder cancer, and it was notable that 83% of 
subjects with a bladder malignancy (83% in the ertugliflozin groups and 80% in the placebo group)

reported current or past tobacco use compared with 54% of subjects in the overall study. There were 29 
subjects with incident bladder neoplasms, 13 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 11 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
group, and 5 in the placebo group. However, 2 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and 1 in the 
placebo group had recurrences of pre-existing bladder cancers. Twelve (50%) of the subjects who 
developed bladder neoplasms in the ertugliflozin groups had hematuria at baseline compared to only 1 
(20%) subject in the placebo group. A case series review was performed to identify subjects with 
hematuria at baseline, pre-existing bladder cancer, exposure to study medication of less than 6 months, 
or time-to-onset of less than one year. Following exclusion of these subjects, there remained 3 subjects 
in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 4 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 3 in the placebo group.  
There were 18 subjects with incident renal neoplasms, 7 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 8 in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group (including one subject who also had bladder malignancy) and 3 in the placebo 
group. Of the subjects with a renal malignancy, 73% in the ertugliflozin groups and 33% in the placebo 
group reported current or past tobacco use, which is a risk factor for renal cancer. In the ertugliflozin 
groups, 1 subject had pre-existing renal cancer compared to none in the placebo group, 3 subjects in the 
ertugliflozin groups were diagnosed with renal cancer within less than a year from start of treatment 
compared to 1 in the placebo group, and 1 subject in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group was exposed to study 
medication for less than 6 months (onset Day 44) compared with none in the placebo group. Four 
subjects in the ertugliflozin groups and 1 in the placebo group had hematuria at baseline. Using the same 
exclusion criteria as for bladder neoplasms, there were 4 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 4 
subjects in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 1 subject in the placebo group. 
Venous thromboembolism 
The incidences of adjudication-confirmed venous thromboembolism events were low (<1%) and similar 
across the ertugliflozin and placebo groups.  
Laboratory findings 
Small mean increases from baseline in hemoglobin in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups  
(0.40 to 0.70 g/dL) were observed at Week 6 and persisted through Month 60. A slight mean decrease 
from baseline in the placebo group (-0.10 to -0.20 g/d) was observed at Week 6 and persisted through 
Month 60. 
Small mean decreases from baseline in uric acid in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (-0.26 mg/dL 
and -0.30 mg/dL, respectively) were observed at Week 6 and persisted through Month 60. Mean values 
over time in the placebo group were similar to baseline through Month 60. 
Small increases in mean percent change from baseline over time in LDL-C were observed in the 
ertugliflozin groups relative to the placebo group.  
Vital signs 
No meaningful differences in mean pulse rate after 1 or 3 minutes of standing were observed between the 
ertugliflozin and placebo groups through Week 26. No meaningful changes from baseline in ECG 
parameters were observed across the ertugliflozin and placebo groups.

NYHA class 
Subjects with NYHA Class II (N=1,289) and NYHA Class III (N=139): In the NYHA Class II subgroup, 
there was a lower number of subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (398) than in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
group (441) and placebo group (450). In the NYHA Class III subgroup, there was a greater number of 
subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (56) and ertugliflozin 15 mg group (46) than in the placebo group 
(37). 
In the NYHA Class II and NYHA Class III subgroups, results for AE summary measures are presented

In the NYHA Class III subgroup, specific AEs that occurred with a notably higher incidence in all 
ertugliflozin group than in the placebo group, that were not similarly observed in the overall VERTIS CV 
population, were atrial fibrillation (10 [9.8%] versus 0 [0%], respectively) and hypoglycemia 
(31 [30.4%] versus 7 [18.9%], respectively (Table 51). 
While a difference in the incidence of atrial fibrillation AEs was observed between all ertugliflozin and 
placebo groups in the NYHA Class III subgroup, none of these AEs were assessed as related to the study 
medication by the investigator. Two of the subjects had a prior medical history of atrial fibrillation, 1 had 
an implantable defibrillator, and all had multiple risk factors for atrial fibrillation. Only 3 of the 10 subjects 
experienced serious atrial fibrillation.

Hypoglycaemia is a specific PT which includes events reported after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy 
(through Week 18) and events reported after Week 18, when subjects were permitted to initiate 
additional AHA therapy to manage glycemic control. Symptomatic and documented (symptomatic and 
asymptomatic) hypoglycemia through Week 18, that exclude post-rescue data, were analysed.  
In the NYHA Class III subgroup, the incidences of hypoglycemia in all ertugliflozin group were not notably 
different from the placebo group across hypoglycemia categories, including severe hypoglycemia, which 
occurred in 2 (2.0%) subjects in all ertugliflozin group and 2 (5.4%) subjects in the placebo group (Table 
51).

Renal function (eGFR) and renal events 
In the Stage 3 CKD subgroup, an initial small decline in mean eGFR at Week 6 in the ertugliflozin groups 
was followed by eGFR values that were near or above baseline for the remainder of the study Figure 20. 
Results in the Stage 3A CKD and Stage 3B CKD were consistent (Figure 21  
Figure 22)

The incidences of renal-related AEs in the Stage 3, Stage 3A, and Stage 3B CKD subgroups in  
Table 59,  
Table 60,  
Table 61). No subjects with Stage 3 CKD had a renal event adjudicated as very likely or probably related 
to study medication, and the numbers of renal events adjudicated as possibly related to study medication 
were low and similar across treatment groups.

Use in pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnant or nursing women were excluded from this study. Women of childbearing potential were to 
undergo pregnancy testing and to use an acceptable method of contraception during the study. 
Nonetheless, if a woman became pregnant, study medication was to be stopped and pregnancy was to be 
followed up until birth or termination of the pregnancy. There was 1 pregnancy reported during the study 
(ertugliflozin 5 mg group) that resulted in the birth of a healthy infant. 
Overdose 
In a few instances, subjects reported taking doses other than the protocol-specified doses of study 
medication. No overdoses were associated with an AE.  
Drug Abuse 
Drug abuse and dependence potential of ertugliflozin has not been characterized. Based on the 
mechanism of action and current post-marketing experience, ertugliflozin is unlikely demonstrate abuse 
potential. 
Post marketing experience 
Ertugliflozin 
Over the cumulative interval from market introduction to 31-MAY-2020, the Sponsor has received 620 
post-marketing AE reports containing 1,009 AEs (901 nonserious, 108 serious) involving patients treated 
with ertugliflozin. The SOCs in which AEs were most commonly reported were General disorders and 
administration site conditions, Infections and Infestations, and Gastrointestinal disorders. 
Of the 108 SAEs reported in patients treated with ertugliflozin, the most commonly reported PTs were 
diabetic ketoacidosis (11 SAEs), acute kidney injury (4 SAEs), and urinary tract infection (4 SAEs). Of the 
11 diabetic ketoacidosis events, ertugliflozin was withdrawn in 9 cases and action taken was unknown 
with 2 patients. The outcome for 8 of the 11 patients was recovered or recovering from the event, 1 
patient did not recover at the time of the report and the outcome was unknown in 2 patients. Diabetic 
ketoacidosis is a listed AE in the ertugliflozin label. Review of these post-marketing safety reports did not 
reveal any new safety findings.  
Ertugliflozin/metformin FDC 
Over the cumulative interval from market introduction to 31-MAY-2020, the Sponsor has received 59 
post-marketing AE reports containing 101 AEs (77 nonserious, 24 serious) involving patients treated with 
ertugliflozin/metformin FDC. The SOCs in which AEs were most commonly reported were Gastrointestinal 
disorders, Injury, poisonings and procedural complications, and General disorders and administration site 
conditions. 
Of the 24 SAEs reported in patients treated with ertugliflozin/metformin, the most commonly reported 
PTs were diabetic ketoacidosis (3 SAEs), adverse event (2 SAEs), and dry mouth (2 SAEs). Review of 
these post-marketing safety reports did not reveal any new safety findings.

3.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The established safety profile of ertugliflozin is based on the original ertugliflozin application submitted for  
treatment of T2DM. The current safety evaluation is based on data from the completed VERTIS CV study. 
The target population were patients with T2DM and established CV disease. 
In the VERTIS CV study, 5,493 subjects were treated with ertugliflozin, with 5,323 subjects (97%) for at 
least 52 weeks, 5173 subjects (94%) for at least 2 years, 2,839 subjects (52%) for at least 3 years and 
2,339 subjects (43%) for at least 4 years. The mean duration of exposure on treatment was about 153 
weeks for ertugliflozin 147 weeks for placebo. The mean duration on study was 182 weeks for 
ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively. 
The incidences of SAEs were similar across the treatment groups; 35%, 34% and 36% for ertugliflozin 5 
mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. The most frequently reported SAEs for were in the SOC 
Cardiac disorders (13.2% and 14.0% vs 15.8% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs placebo), e.g. acute 
myocardial infarction/ myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and angina unstable. There were slightly more 
fatal cases in the ertugliflozin groups (4.8% and 4.9%) compared with the placebo group (4.3%).  
The most frequently reported AEs with an outcome of death were within the SOC Cardiac disorders (e.g. 
cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction) and the SOC General disorders (PT death). 
Discontinuation rates due to AE were slightly higher for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (7.5% and 7.3%) 
compared to placebo (6.8%). The most frequently reported AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was 
dizziness; 0.4% and 0.1% vs <0.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs placebo. 
Urinary tract infections 
The incidence of UTIs was slightly higher for ertugliflozin 5 mg (12.2%) and 15 mg (12.0%) compared to 
placebo (10.2%). The incidence of SAEs of UTIs was low across the treatment groups (1.5%, 0.7% and 
1.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo). 
Genital infections 
The incidence of genital infections was dose-dependently increased in females (4.4% and 5.1% vs 1.2%) 
and males (6.0% and 7.8% vs 2.4%) for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg as compared to placebo. Phimosis 
was reported in 33 cases (0.9%) for ertugliflozin compared with 2 cases (0.1%) for placebo. 
Volume depletion 
The incidence of AEs of volume depletion was similar for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (4.3%) compared 
with placebo (3.8%).  
Renal function 
In the VERTIS CV study, treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with an initial decrease in eGFR 
which returned towards baseline. However, at 60 months of treatment, the mean changes in eGFR from 
baseline was smaller for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (-2.4 and -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
respectively) compared with the placebo (-6.8 mL/min/1.73 m2).   
The incidence of renal-related adverse events was similar for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (4.2% and 
4.3%) compared to placebo (4.7%). 
Fractures 
The incidences of adjudication-confirmed fractures were similar for ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.6%), 15 mg 
(3.7%) and placebo (3.6%). In the subgroup of patients with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 97/113 
 
 
 
 
incidence of fractures was increased for ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.9%) and 15 mg (6.8%) compared with 
placebo (1.6%). 
Amputations 
In the VERTIS CV study, subjects with events of non-traumatic lower limb amputation were reported with 
an incidence of 2.0% (0.57 subjects with event/100 PY), 2.1% (0.60 subjects with event/100 PY) and 
1.6% (0.47 subjects with event/100 PY) for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo groups.  
The event rate of lower limb amputations was 0.75 and 0.96 vs 0.74 events per 100 PY for ertugliflozin 5 
mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg vs placebo. The proposed wording on lower limb amputations in the SmPC 
(section 4.4) has been adequately updated with the event rates. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
The incidence of DKA/ketoacidosis was higher for all ertugliflozin group (0.3%; n=19) compared to 
placebo (0.1%; n=2), corresponding to an incidence rate of 0.10 and 0.02 subjects per 100 PY for all 
ertugliflozin and placebo. Six of the 21 confirmed cases of ketoacidosis were classified as non-serious (1 
in the placebo group and 5 in the ertugliflozin group). Three of these six non-serious cases were 
adjudicated as ‘possible’, 2 as ‘probable,’ and one as ‘certain’ cases of ketoacidosis. 
Hypoglycaemic events 
The incidence of documented hypoglycaemia was high and similar across the treatment groups (45% and 
44% vs 44%). In the sub-study when ertugliflozin was added to insulin with or without metformin, the 
incidences of documented hypoglycaemia were similar across treatment groups (39% and 39% vs 38%). 
When ertugliflozin was added to SU, the incidences were, 7.3%, 9.3% and 4.2% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 
ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. When ertugliflozin was added to metformin with SU, the 
incidences of hypoglycaemia were 20%, 26% and 14% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and 
placebo, respectively. 
Pancreatitis 
The numbers of subjects with adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events were low and similar in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.4%), 15 mg (0.2%), and placebo (0.4%) groups. 
Hepatic events 
The proportion of subjects with increases in ALT or AST that met a PDLC >3X ULN or PDLC >20X ULN 
were low (0.1-0.2% across all groups). No ertugliflozin-treated subject experienced hepatic events that 
were adjudicated as very likely or probably related to study medication. 
Hypersensitivity 
The incidences of potential hypersensitivity events were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (4.4%), 15 mg 
(5.2%), and placebo groups (4.4%). The incidences of serious potential hypersensitivity AEs were low 
and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.3%), 15 mg (0.3%), and placebo groups (0.4%).  
Malignancy 
The overall incidences of malignancies were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5.9%), 15 mg (5.5%), and 
placebo (5.5%) groups. However, the incidences of AEs in the HLGT of Renal and urinary tract neoplasms 
malignant and unspecified (predominantly bladder and renal cancers) were higher in the ertugliflozin 
groups compared with the placebo group (0.7% and 0.7% vs 0.3% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs 
placebo). The results were similar in subjects treated for >6 months and with onset >6 months after first 
dose of study medication (0.6% and 0.6% vs 0.3% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs placebo).

Venous thromboembolism 
The incidences of adjudication-confirmed venous thromboembolism events were low (<1%) and similar 
across the ertugliflozin and placebo groups. 
Fournier’s gangrene 
No event of Fournier’s gangrene was identified. There were 4 subjects with AEs of skin necrosis or gas 
gangrene, 2 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 2 in the placebo group. The AEs for all 4 subjects 
involved the lower limb. 
Laboratory findings 
Results of laboratory findings were in general consistent with the results reported in the original 
application for ertugliflozin. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
In the VERTIS CV study, 903 subjects (about 11%) were above 75 years of age. Overall, the incidence of 
AEs and SAEs were higher for subjects with ≥75 than <75 years of age. In both subjects ≥75 and <75 
years of age, the incidence of genital infections and UTIs was higher for ertugliflozin than for placebo. The 
incidence of volume depletion was higher for ertugliflozin than for placebo in subjects ≥75 years of age 
and was balanced for subjects <75 years. The incidence of renal events was slightly higher for 
ertugliflozin tan for placebo in subjects ≥75 years; however, was higher for placebo than for ertugliflozin 
in subjects <75 years. 
Effect NYHA class 
In total 1,289 subjects (16%) with NYHA class II and 139 subjects (1.7%) with NYHA class III were 
included in the VERTIS CV study. SAEs and deaths were more frequent in patients with HF, with the 
highest frequencies observed in patients in NYHA class III. In the NYHA class II subgroup, the incidences 
of SAEs, volume depletion and renal events were in line with the overall population. In the NYHA class III 
group, the incidence of renal events (3.6% and 10.9% vs 2.7%) was dos-dependently higher for 
ertugliflozin than for placebo. Four of the 5 cases with renal AEs in the 15 mg ertugliflozin group, were 
secondary to non-renal events (infectious and cardiac causes). The remaining case reported acute renal 
failure and was assessed as non-serious and mild in intensity. Moreover, in one of the two cases in the 5 
mg ertugliflozin group and in the only case in the placebo group, the renal events were secondary caused 
by infections.  
Of note in the NYHA class III, a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation ertugliflozin (9.8% vs 0%) and 
hypoglycaemia (30% vs 19%) was observed for ertugliflozin compared to placebo. However, none of the 
cases of atrial fibrillation for ertugliflozin were assessed as related by the Investigator, only 3 cases were 
serious, and all cases had risk factors in the medical history. In analyses of symptomatic and documented 
hypoglycaemia through week 18, excluding post-rescue data, the incidences of hypoglycaemia were 
similar for ertugliflozin and placebo in the subgroup with NYHA class III.  
Effect by renal function 
A total of 1,776 (22%) subjects had Stage 3 CKD, of which 1,319 subjects had Stage 3A CKD (baseline 
eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 457 subjects had Stage 3B CKD (baseline eGFR 30 to 
<45 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in subjects with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73m2 (44.1% vs 
44.3%) than in subjects with eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (39.0% vs 41.0%); however, the SAE 
incidence rate was similar for all ertugliflozin and placebo in both subgroups. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 99/113 
 
 
 
 
The incidence rate of AEs leading to discontinuation was higher for all ertugliflozin (9.7%) than for 
placebo (6.6%) in subjects with eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2; however, were higher for placebo 
(13.9%) than for all ertugliflozin (11.7%) in subjects with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73m2.  
The safety profile in stage 3 CKD subgroup was in general consistent with the overall population. Overall, 
there was no major differences in the incidences of UTIs, genital infections and hypoglycaemia in the 
subgroup of moderate renal impairment compared to the overall population. The incidence of volume 
depletion was overall increased, compared with the overall population; although, similar across the 
treatment arms.  
However, in the subgroup of patients with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of fractures 
was increased for ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.9%) and 15 mg (6.8%) compared with placebo (1.6%). Moreover, 
the frequency of renal events was higher in the stage 3B CKD stratum (12.5% and 15.6% vs 15.8%) 
across all treatment groups, compared with the stage 3A CKD population (8.8% and 8.0% vs 8.2%) and 
the overall population. This is expected and considered related to the underlying renal disease in the 3B 
CKD subgroup. In the CKD stage 3 subgroup, the eGFR for ertugliflozin returned to baseline and remained 
near or above baseline to the end of the study. In the CKD 1 and 2 subgroups, the eGFR returned 
towards baseline but remined below baseline throughout the study. Initially (0-6 weeks), the rate of 
decrease in eGFR was faster in the CKD stage 1 subgroup and slower in the CKD stage 3 subgroup (both 
for ertugliflozin and placebo). The difference may be due to higher eGFR in patients with CKD stage 1 and 
2 and a low degree of proteinuria in the CKD stage 3 population. In VERTIS CV, most patients (60%) 
were within the normal range of albuminuria at baseline. Micro-albuminuria (≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g) was 
present in 30.2% of the subjects and macro-albuminuria (>300 mg/g) in 9.2%. The median baseline 
UACR in CKD stage 3 patients were 31 (8-117) and 30 (8-136) mg/g for placebo and ertugliflozin, 
respectively. Similar patterns of eGFR changes over time in subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min have been 
observed in the CVOT for other SGLT2 inhibitors, which also has been performed in subjects with 
relatively low levels of proteinuria and at lower risk of kidney events. 
3.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile in patients with T2DM and established CV disease seems to be rather similar to the one 
previously documented for ertugliflozin. 
The safety profile in subjects with moderate renal impairment was in general consistent with the overall 
population. Overall, there was no major differences in the incidences of UTIs, genital infections and 
hypoglycaemia in the subgroup of moderate renal impairment compared to the overall population. The 
incidence of volume depletion was overall increased, compared with the overall population, although 
similar across the treatment arms.  
However, in the subgroup of patients with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of fractures 
was increased for ertugliflozin compared with placebo. Moreover, the frequency of renal events was 
higher in the stage 3B CKD stratum (eGFR 30-45) across all treatment groups, compared with the stage 
3A CKD population (eGFR 45-60). This is expected and considered related to the underlying renal disease 
in the 3B CKD subgroup. 
The study included a substantial number of elderly subjects (≥75 years of age) with no indication of a 
different safety profile, supporting the proposed changes to the SmPC for this population.  
In the NYHA class II, a relevant number of patients was included. The incidences of SAEs, volume 
depletion and renal events in the NYHA class II were in line with the overall population. In the NYHA class 
III subgroup, the incidence of renal events was dos-dependently increased for ertugliflozin compared with 
placebo but most of the cases with renal AEs were secondary to non-renal events (infectious and cardiac

causes). Data provided does not raise any safety concern with the use of ertugliflozin in patients with HF 
NYHA class III. However, data in NYHA class III should be interpreted with caution due to a limited 
number of patients (n=139).

6.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Based on the submitted data on CV safety, the MAH wish to extend the indication for Steglatro and 
Segluromet as follows: 
“Steglatro is indicated for the treatment of in adults aged 18 years and older with insufficiently controlled 
type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control:  
•  as monotherapy in patients for whom the use of when metformin is considered inappropriate 
due to intolerance or contraindications.  
• 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
(For study results with respect to combinations of therapies, and effects on glycaemic control, 
cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.)” 
“Segluromet is indicated in adults for the treatment of aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
• 
in patients not adequately insufficiently controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of 
metformin alone 
in combination with in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin in addition to 
other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes in patients insufficiently controlled with 
metformin and these products  
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets.  
(For study results with respect to combinations of therapies, and effects on glycaemic control, 
cardiovascular events and the population studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.) 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with diabetes are at high risk for adverse outcomes from ASCVD, HF, and CKD. Patients with 
T2DM have a 2- to 4- fold increased risk of CV disease relative to those without T2DM, and CV disease is 
the leading cause of death and complications in patients with T2DM.  
In large outcome studies, members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class have been shown to reduce the risk of CV 
and renal outcomes in subjects with and without T2DM. A consistent finding in all of these studies is a 
robust effect of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment on reducing the risk of HHF. Preservation of renal function has 
also been a consistent finding in these studies. 
Current diabetes and cardiovascular society guidelines have been significantly impacted by the results of 
these outcome studies. The 2020 American Diabetes Association Standards of Care recommends that if 
ASCVD predominates, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven CV disease benefit, if 
eGFR is adequate, should be used for the treatment of patients with T2DM. However, if HF and/or CKD 
predominates, the use of a SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit in reducing HF and/or CKD progression, if

eGFR is adequate, should be used (if tolerated). 
6.1.3.  Main clinical study 
The VERTIS CV study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
event-driven study. This study was intended to address two overarching objectives: the first focused on 
CV safety (non-inferiority) and the second focused on CV and renal efficacy (superiority). 
The study evaluated two doses of ertugliflozin, 5 mg and 15 mg qd, compared to placebo. The primary 
endpoint, MACE, was evaluated using the pooled data from the two active treatment arms. 
In addition, three glycaemic sub-studies of 18 weeks duration in subjects receiving specific background 
anti-hyperglycaemic treatments were included to evaluate the efficacy of ertugliflozin in combinations not 
previously studied: 1) insulin with or without metformin, 2) SU monotherapy and 3) metformin and SU. 
In total 8,246 patients were randomised in the study with 2,752 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 
2,747 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and 2,747 subjects in the placebo group. The mean duration on 
study was 3.5 years. The study population is considered representative of the target population of T2DM 
patients at high CV risk, and 76% of the patients were on concomitant treatment with metformin. 
In a pre-specified analysis, the efficacy of ertugliflozin was evaluated in patients with Stage 3 CKD.  In 
the VERTIS CV study, 21.5% of the subjects (1 776 patients) had an eGFR 30 – 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 
baseline (Stage 3 CKD). 
6.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint as non-inferiority for MACE was shown for the “All ertugliflozin” group 
(HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.848, 1.114). Non-inferiority was also shown for each of the two doses (5 mg and 15 
mg) but it is noted that the HR for the higher dose was 1.04 compared to 0.91 for the lower dose. No 
meaningful differences were observed for the components of MACE compared to placebo. The Kaplan-
Meier curves separated slightly after about 6 months but converged again after about three years. 
A post-hoc analysis was conducted, where the CV death component of MACE was replaced by “All-cause 
death”, which showed a comparable HR (0.97; 95% CI: 0.867 to 1.093) as for the primary analysis.  
The subgroup analysis generally showed consistent findings across the subgroups. Although point 
estimates for the HR varied somewhat, the 95% CI was within the non-inferiority margin also for all large 
subgroups.  
Superiority could not be demonstrated for the key secondary endpoint “CV death or HHF” (HR 0.88; 95% 
CI: 0.750, 1.034). The outcome was comparable when “CV death” was exchanged by “All-cause death or 
HHF” (HR: 0.90; 95.8% CI; 0.776 to 1.032). The findings were generally consistent across subgroups. 
The secondary endpoint “total CV death/HHF events” (i.e. not censored at the time of the first event), 
showed a reduction in the total number of events (HR 0.82 95% CI 0.716, 0.945). 
“CV death” was analysed separately as a secondary endpoint. There was no noticeable difference between 
treatment groups (HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.767, 1.113).  
A comparable outcome was observed for the secondary endpoint "All-cause death” (HR: 0.93; 95% CI, 
0.797 to 1.081). 
The secondary endpoint “time to first HHF” was not subject to hypothesis testing but the analysis showed 
a 30% reduction of the risk with a CI excluding 1 (HR 0.70; 95% CI:0.539, 0.902). Comparable 
outcomes were observed for both doses (HR 0.71 and 0.68 for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 104/113 
 
 
 
 
The Kaplan-Meier curves separated early and the separation continued for the duration of the study. The 
data was further supported by the analysis of recurrent HF hospital admissions and mortality in subjects 
with a first HHF event, which was lower in the ertugliflozin treated groups compared to placebo. 
Other CV efficacy endpoints analyzed in VERTIS CV were time to first MACE+, fatal or non-fatal MI, fatal 
or non-fatal stroke and HHF. Apart from a reduction of the risk of HHF, no differences were observed 
between the ertugliflozin treated groups and placebo.  
Composite of renal events 
No formal hypothesis testing of the composite of renal events (renal death, renal dialysis/transplant, or 
doubling of serum creatinine from baseline) was performed, but it is noted that the 19% reduction of 
events in the ertugliflozin treated groups was not statistically significant since the CI includes 1 (HR 0.81; 
95% CI: 0.630, 1.036). The Kaplan-Meier curve show a separation of the curves over time. The outcome 
is mainly driven by the effect on serum creatinine, whereas other components of the composite endpoint 
were rare and balanced between groups.    
Glycaemic control and cardiometabolic endpoints  
In the study, beneficial effects on HbA1c, body weight and blood pressure were observed with 
ertugliflozin treatment. The changes observed at week 18, after which the anti-hyperglycaemic treatment 
could be adjusted, were of comparable magnitude as observed in previous clinical studies with 
ertugliflozin. 
Use in patients with renal impairment 
In the overall Stage 3 CKD population, ertugliflozin treatment resulted in a modest decrease in HbA1c of 
0.27% (5 mg dose) and 0.28% (15 mg dose), in line with the data from the dedicated study in patients 
with Stage 3 CKD assessed in the MAA. In contrast to the previous study, no increase is observed with 
increasing dose. The calculated odds of achieving HbA1c <7.0% was higher with ertugliflozin (20.7% and 
17.0% for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively) compared to placebo (12.9%), but still modest. 
Statistically significant reductions of FPG were observed for both doses.  
Comparable results were observed for the Stage 3A CKD subgroup (GFR 45-60), where a reduction of 
0.27% (5 mg dose) and 0.31% (15 mg dose) was observed, whereas the effect on HbA1c was further 
attenuated in the subgroup with Stage 3B CKD subgroup (GFR 30-45) with no statistically significant 
difference observed with the 15 mg dose compared to placebo.  
Descriptive data show that eGFR was maintained in patients with CKD stage 3a and 3b during ertugliflozin 
treatment. The relative risk reduction in the time to first HHF appears to be preserved in patients with 
baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR 0.50 (95% CI; 0.33, 0.76)). The effects of ertugliflozin on SBP 
and body weight were largely comparable for patients with CKD3 compared to the overall population. The 
effect on glycaemic control in patients with eGFR 30-45 was attenuated (about -0.2% to -0.3%, placebo 
adjusted). 
Glycaemic sub-studies 
Add-on to insulin with or without metformin 
When added to a background therapy of insulin with or without metformin, ertugliflozin resulted in a 
statistically significant decrease in HbA1c of -0.58% with the 5 mg dose and -0.65% with the 15 mg dose 
(placebo-adjusted). Statistically significant decreases in FPG were also observed and the proportion of 
patients achieving the target of HbA1c <7.0% were twice as high (20.7% and 21.1% for ertugliflozin 5 
mg and 15 mg respectively, vs 10.7% for placebo). A placebo-adjusted decrease in body weight of -1.62 
kg (5 mg dose) and -1.88 kg (15 mg dose) was also observed. A statistically significant reduction of SBP 
vs placebo was observed whereas the decrease in DBP did not reach statistical significance.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021

Add-on to SU monotherapy 
No statistically significant effect could be demonstrated when ertugliflozin was given as add-on to 
monotherapy with SU. The placebo-adjusted change in HbA1c was -0.35% with the 5 mg dose and -
0.22% with the 15 mg dose. The effect on body weight was also modest (placebo-adjusted: -1.07 kg and 
-0.52 kg for the 5 mg and 15 mg dose, respectively), and SBP and DBP increased compared to placebo.  
Add-on to metformin and SU 
When added to metformin and SU, ertugliflozin resulted in a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c of -
0.66% with the 5 mg dose and -0.75% with the 15 mg dose (placebo-adjusted). Statistically significant 
decreases in FPG were also observed and the proportion of patients achieving the target of HbA1c <7.0% 
were almost three times as high (37.0% and 32.7% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively, vs 
12.8% for placebo). A placebo-adjusted decrease in body weight of -1.57 kg (5 mg dose) and -1.94 kg 
(15 mg dose) was also observed. Only modest reductions of SBP and DBP vs placebo were observed, 
none of which reached statistical significance.  
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The MAH proposes to lower the limit for initiation of ertugliflozin treatment to eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and to allow treatment down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The new data provided indicate that 
there may be beneficial effects on renal function, HHF, SBP and body weight in patients with eGFR 30-60 
mL/min/1.73 m2. The outcomes with regards to beneficial effects on renal function and HHF in the overall 
population could not be formally tested for statistical significance, but the observed outcomes are in line 
with those reported for other SGLT2i and possibly reflects a class effect.  
Results from the post-hoc subgroup analyses from other SGLT2i suggest a reduced CV and renal benefit 
in those patients without albuminuria (and thus the largest benefits in patients with macro-albuminuria) 
at baseline, as shown in CANVAS (CV trial) and DECLARE-TIMI (only renal (currently) available), although 
such results are hampered by the limited data available.  
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The current safety evaluation is based on data from the completed VERTIS CV study. The target 
population were patients with T2DM and established CV disease. 
In the VERTIS CV study, 5,493 subjects were treated with ertugliflozin, with 5,323 subjects (97%) for at 
least 52 weeks, 5173 subjects (94%) for at least 2 years, 2,839 subjects (52%) for at least 3 years and 
2,339 subjects (43%) for at least 4 years. The mean duration of exposure on treatment was about 153 
weeks for ertugliflozin 147 weeks for placebo. The mean duration on study was 182 weeks for 
ertugliflozin and placebo, respectively. 
The incidences of SAEs were similar across the treatment groups; 35%, 34% and 36% for ertugliflozin 5 
mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. The most frequently reported SAEs for were in the SOC 
Cardiac disorders (13.2% and 14.0% vs 15.8% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs placebo). 
Discontinuation rates due to AE were slightly higher for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (7.5% and 7.3%) 
compared to placebo (6.8%). The most frequently reported AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was 
dizziness; 0.4% and 0.1% vs <0.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs placebo. 
Urinary tract infections 
UTIs was reported slightly more often for ertugliflozin 5 mg (12.2%) and 15 mg (12.0%) than for placebo 
(10.2%).

Genital infections 
The incidence of genital infections was dose-dependently increased in females (4.4% and 5.1% vs 1.2%) 
and males (6.0% and 7.8% vs 2.4%) for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg as compared to placebo.  
Volume depletion 
The incidence of AEs of volume depletion was similar for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (4.3%) compared 
with placebo (3.8%).  
Renal function 
Treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with an initial decrease in eGFR which returned towards 
baseline. However, at 60 months of treatment, the mean changes in eGFR from baseline was smaller for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (-2.4 and -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively) compared with the 
placebo (-6.8 mL/min/1.73 m2).   
The incidence of renal-related adverse events was similar for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (4.2% and 
4.3%) compared to placebo (4.7%). 
Fractures 
The incidences of adjudication-confirmed fractures were similar for ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.6%), 15 mg 
(3.7%) and placebo (3.6%).  
Amputations 
Subjects with events of non-traumatic lower limb amputation were reported with an incidence of 2.0% 
(0.57 subjects with event/100 PY), 2.1% (0.60 subjects with event/100 PY) and 1.6% (0.47 subjects with 
event/100 PY) for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo groups. The event rate of lower limb 
amputations was 0.75 and 0.96 vs 0.74 events per 100 PY for ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg 
vs placebo. The proposed wording on lower limb amputations in the SmPC has been adequately updated 
with the event rates. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
The incidence of DKA/ketoacidosis was higher for all ertugliflozin group (0.3%; n=19) compared to 
placebo (0.1%; n=2), corresponding to an incidence rate of 0.10 and 0.02 subjects per 100 PY for all 
ertugliflozin and placebo.  
Hypoglycaemic events 
The incidence of documented hypoglycaemia was high and similar across the treatment groups (45% and 
44% vs 44%). In the sub-study when ertugliflozin was added to insulin with or without metformin, the 
incidences of documented hypoglycaemia were similar across treatment groups (39% and 39% vs 38%). 
When ertugliflozin was added to SU, the incidences were, 7.3%, 9.3% and 4.2% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 
ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. When ertugliflozin was added to metformin with SU, the 
incidences of hypoglycaemia were 20%, 26% and 14% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and 
placebo, respectively. 
Pancreatitis 
The numbers of subjects with adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis events were low and similar in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.4%), 15 mg (0.2%), and placebo (0.4%) groups. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/612874/2021 
Page 107/113 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic events 
The proportion of subjects with increases in ALT or AST that met a PDLC >3X ULN or PDLC >20X ULN 
were low (0.1-0.2% across all groups). No ertugliflozin-treated subject experienced hepatic events that 
were adjudicated as very likely or probably related to study medication. 
Hypersensitivity 
The incidences of potential hypersensitivity events were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (4.4%), 15 mg 
(5.2%), and placebo groups (4.4%). The incidences of serious potential hypersensitivity AEs were low 
and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.3%), 15 mg (0.3%), and placebo groups (0.4%).  
Malignancy 
The overall incidences of malignancies were similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (5.9%), 15 mg (5.5%), and 
placebo (5.5%) groups.  
Venous thromboembolism 
The incidences of adjudication-confirmed venous thromboembolism events were low (<1%) and similar 
across the ertugliflozin and placebo groups. 
Fournier’s gangrene 
No event of Fournier’s gangrene was identified. There were 4 subjects with AEs of skin necrosis or gas 
gangrene, 2 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 2 in the placebo group. The AEs for all 4 subjects 
involved the lower limb. 
Laboratory findings 
Results of laboratory findings were in general consistent with the results reported in the original 
application for ertugliflozin. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
In the VERTIS CV study, 903 subjects (about 11%) were above 75 years of age. Overall, the incidence of 
AEs and SAEs were higher for subjects with ≥75 than <75 years of age. In both subjects ≥75 and <75 
years of age, the incidence of genital infections and UTIs was higher for ertugliflozin than for placebo. The 
incidence of volume depletion was higher for ertugliflozin than for placebo in subjects ≥75 years of age 
and was balanced for subjects <75 years. The incidence of renal events was slightly higher for 
ertugliflozin tan for placebo in subjects ≥75 years; however, was higher for placebo than for ertugliflozin 
in subjects <75 years 
Effect NYHA class 
In total 1,289 subjects (16%) with NYHA class II and 139 subjects (1.7%) with NYHA class III were 
included in the VERTIS CV study. SAEs and deaths were more frequent in patients with HF, with the 
highest frequencies observed in patients in NYHA class III. In the NYHA class II subgroup, the incidences 
of SAEs, volume depletion and renal events were in line with the overall population. In the NYHA class III 
group, the incidence of renal events (3.6% and 10.9% vs 2.7%) was dos-dependently higher for 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 108/113 
 
 
 
 
ertugliflozin than for placebo but most of the cases with renal AEs were secondary to non-renal events 
(infectious and cardiac causes).  
Effect by renal function 
A total of 1,776 (22%) subjects had Stage 3 CKD, of which 1,319 subjects had Stage 3A CKD (baseline 
eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 457 subjects had Stage 3B CKD (baseline eGFR 30 to 
<45 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in subjects with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73m2 (44.1% vs 
44.3%) than in subjects with eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (39.0% vs 41.0%); however, the SAE 
incidence rate was similar for all ertugliflozin and placebo in both subgroups. 
The incidence rate of AEs leading to discontinuation was higher for all ertugliflozin (9.7%) than for 
placebo (6.6%) in subjects with eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2; however, were higher for placebo 
(13.9%) than for all ertugliflozin (11.7%) in subjects with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73m2.  
The safety profile in stage 3 CKD subgroup was in general consistent with the overall population. Overall, 
there was no major differences in the incidences of UTIs, genital infections and hypoglycaemia in the 
subgroup of moderate renal impairment compared to the overall population. The incidence of volume 
depletion was overall increased, compared with the overall population; although similar across the 
treatment arms.  
However, in the subgroup of patients with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of fractures 
was increased for ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.9%) and 15 mg (6.8%) compared with placebo (1.6%). Moreover, 
the frequency of renal events was higher in the stage 3B CKD stratum (12.5% and 15.6% vs 15.8%) 
across all treatment groups, compared with the stage 3A CKD population (8.8% and 8.0% vs 8.2%) and 
the overall population. This is expected and considered related to the underlying renal disease in the 3B 
CKD subgroup.  
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Data provided does not raise any safety concern with the use of ertugliflozin in patients with HF NYHA 
class II or III. However, data in NYHA class III should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number 
of patients (n=139).

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
VERTIS CV was primarily conducted to investigate the impact of ertugliflozin treatment on CV risk in 
patients with T2DM. Since the majority (76.3%) of patients were on concomitant treatment with 
metformin, the data is of relevance for both Steglatro (ertugliflozin) and the FDC Segluromet (ertugliflozin 
+ metformin).  
The trial showed non-inferiority of ertugliflozin to placebo on the primary outcome MACE whereas 
superiority was not shown. The point estimate is below 1 but somewhat higher than for other products in 
the class, in spite of the fact that a high proportion of patients with established CV disease was included 
in the VERTIS CV study. 
A statistically significant lower risk of hospitalisations due to HF compared to placebo was observed, 
whereas no difference compared to placebo could be shown on CV death or all-cause mortality. A lower 
risk (of the same magnitude) of hospitalisation for HF has also been documented for other products in the 
class and is not unexpected considering the diuretic effect. The relative risk reduction for hospitalisation 
due to HF was 30% while the absolute reduction was only 1.1%. 
The impact on renal events was investigated and the data indicate that progression of nephropathy was 
slower in the ertugliflozin group compared to the placebo group, as indicated by a slower increase in 
serum creatinine. Thus, the data provided give no indication of a negative effect on renal function. Similar 
results with respect to renal events have been described for other SGLT2-inhibitors. 
The data from VERTIS CV on HF and other CV outcomes are of interest for the prescribers and is reflected 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The indication is proposed to be amended by removal of the wording “to 
improve glycaemic control” and the addition of a cross-reference to study results on cardiovascular 
events in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Previously, this broadening of the indication has been reserved for 
products with a documented superior effect on MACE compared to placebo (albeit that the upper CI has 
been very close to 1 for all products). Based on the mechanism of action and support from other products 
in the class, the finding is considered as highly plausible and thus, ertugliflozin is considered to have 
additional effects in addition to the glucose lowering effect.  
The data from the glycaemic sub-studies investigating the effect of ertugliflozin as on add-on to 1) insulin 
with or without metformin, and 2) metformin with SU, showed clinically relevant effects with ertugliflozin 
treatment and these data should be reflected in the SmPC. The third glycaemic sub-study on the 
combination of ertugliflozin to SU monotherapy however failed to show any clinically relevant effect. 
No major safety concerns arise from the data provided. The safety profile in patients with T2DM and 
established CV disease seems to be rather similar to the one previously documented for ertugliflozin. 
The safety profile in subjects with moderate renal impairment was in general consistent with the overall 
population. Overall, there was no major differences in the incidences of UTIs, genital infections and 
hypoglycaemia in the subgroup of moderate renal impairment compared to the overall population. The 
incidence of volume depletion was overall increased, compared with the overall population; although, 
similar across the treatment arms. However, in the subgroup of patients with eGFR 30 to <45 
mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of fractures was increased for ertugliflozin compared with placebo. 
Moreover, the frequency of renal events was higher in the stage 3B CKD stratum (eGFR 30-45) across all 
treatment groups, compared with the stage 3A CKD population (eGFR 45-60). This is expected and 
considered related to the underlying renal disease in the 3B CKD subgroup.

The study included a substantial number of elderly subjects (≥75 years of age) with no indication of a 
different safety profile, supporting the proposed changes to the SmPC for this population. Data provided 
do not raise any safety concern with the use of ertugliflozin in patients with HF NYHA class II or III. 
However, data in NYHA class III should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of patients 
(n=139). 
With this application the eGFR limit for initiation of treatment is lowered to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the 
limit for discontinuation is lowered to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The MAH has provided data supporting that 
patients with eGFR 30-60 have additional benefits in terms of preservation of renal function and a 
reduced risk of HHF with ertugliflozin treatment, which outweigh the loss of glycaemic effects in this 
population. No safety concerns arise from the data presented for patients with eGFR 30-60.  
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The VERTIS CV study provides important information concerning the long-term safety of ertugliflozin as 
well as the effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC has been 
modified to reflect the glycaemic and CV benefits of ertugliflozin by removing the reference to the 
surrogate goal “to improve glycaemic control” and by inserting a cross reference to the results of the 
VERTIS CV study presented in section 5.1.  
Sufficient data supporting the lowering of the eGFR limit for initiation of treatment to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and to lower the limit for discontinuation to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 has been provided. The data show that 
this population have additional benefits in terms of preservation of renal function and a reduced risk of 
HHF with ertugliflozin treatment which outweigh the loss of glycaemic effects in this population. 
In addition, relevant information on the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin when used in combination with 
insulin with or without metformin, and in combination with metformin and SU, has been provided. 
Clinically relevant effects on glycaemic control have been shown and no new safety concerns arise from 
the data provided. Relevant information on efficacy and safety related to the combinations has been 
included in the SmPC. 
6.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Steglatro and Segluromet in the updated indication is considered positive.

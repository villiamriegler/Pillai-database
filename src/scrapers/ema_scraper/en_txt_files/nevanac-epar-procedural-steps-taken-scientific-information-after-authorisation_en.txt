are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Nevanac, including all variations introduced since the

marketing authorisation was granted, and based on these 
data considered that the risk-benefit balance of Nevanac in

remains favourable. 
The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing

Due to the limited data available for long-term use of

periodic safety update reports should be submitted every 6

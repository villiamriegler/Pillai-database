Extension of indication to include treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults patients who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more DMARDs for BIMZELX, based on interim 
results of a Phase III study in biological DMARD naïve study participants (PA0010; BE OPTIMAL) and the 
final results of the Phase III study in study participants who are inadequate responders (inadequate 
response or intolerant) to ≤2 prior TNF inhibitors (PA0011; BE COMPLETE). Both Phase III studies are 
interventional studies aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab. For PA0010, the Initial 
Treatment Period was placebo- and non inferential active reference (adalimumab)-controlled, while 
PA0011 was placebo-controlled. Further supportive data comprise the results of a Phase 1 study 
(PA0007), a Phase 2b dose-finding study (PA0008) and a Phase 2 open label extension study (PA0009). A 
Phase 3 open-label extension study is currently ongoing (PA0012). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 to the SmPC have been updated. The Package leaflet is updated in accordance. 
Version 1.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.2 rev.1.  
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0456/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0456/2020 not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis, which is classified 
within the group of the spondyloarthritis. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is an umbrella term applied to a family 
of rheumatic diseases (including psoriatic arthritis [PsA], axial spondyloarthritis [axSpA], reactive 
arthritis, the arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis) that 
have features in common with each other and distinct from other inflammatory arthritides, particularly 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  
Spondyloarthritides generally have distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint involvement, asymmetric 
distribution, dactylitis (inflammation of the whole digit), enthesitis (inflammation at the site of tendon 
insertion into bone), spinal involvement, and an association with the Class I human leukocyte antigen 
B27 (HLA-B27) allele. The assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society working group 
established classification criteria to distinguish 2 broad categories of SpA: peripheral SpA and axSpA. This 
division is based on the body part predominantly involved in the inflammatory process. Therefore, 
peripheral SpA includes diseases affecting mainly peripheral joints, such as reactive arthritis and PsA, 
whereas axSpA comprises those diseases with mainly axial involvement (sacroiliac joints and spine), 
including ankylosing spondylitis diagnosed with definite radiographic changes of the sacroiliac joint and 
non-radiographic axSpA. 
The claimed therapeutic indication 
The initially proposed indication for bimekizumab in PsA was as follows:  
“Bimekizumab, alone or in combination with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(cDMARDs), is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an 
inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more DMARDs”. 
Epidemiology  
Psoriasis affects 1-3% of the population. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal 
disorder, which occurs in approximately 6% to 41% of people affected by psoriasis (PSO). The estimated 
prevalence of PsA ranges between 0.1% and 1%. Psoriatic arthritis can develop at any time, but for most 
people it appears between the ages of 30 and 50, and it affects men and women equally.  
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The etiologic events that underlie the development of psoriasis and PsA are not well understood. Available 
evidence indicates that these disorders show great complexity and heterogeneity, and that genetic and 
environmental factors converge to trigger inflammatory events in multiple immune pathways.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 9/234 
 
 
 
 
  
It is reasonable to assume, although not proven, that psoriasis skin and joint inflammation share 
pathogenetic origins. Support for this assumption is based upon overlapping genetic risk alleles, 
environmental triggers, and cytokine pathways; however, the resident cells that populate the skin and 
joint are considerably different, and cutaneous and musculoskeletal clinical activity are often divergent in 
individual patients. 
The infiltration of immune cells into the skin and musculoskeletal tissues, coupled with shared disease 
pathways of innate (TNF) and acquired immunity (interleukin [IL] 23/IL-17 pathway), provides strong 
support for the concept that the pathogenesis of PsA is directed by a dysregulated immune response 
(Barnas JL et al, 2015). 
Evidence suggests that psoriasis is driven by both adaptive and innate immune responses, although the 
interplay of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms in PsA is not well understood (McGonagle D, 2011). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
With the exception of the distal interphalangeal joints (hands and feet), there are no predictable joints for 
involvement in PsA and the signs of inflammation are often non symmetrical and more difficult to detect 
compared with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Spondyloarthopathy is often present. Some typical features of 
PsA are dactylitis and nail psoriasis. Extra-cutaneous and extra-articular manifestations are uncommon 
but may include conjunctivitis, uveitis, aortic insufficiency, and pulmonary fibrosis.  
Psoriatic arthritis may start slowly with mild symptoms or develop quickly. Flares and remissions usually 
characterise the course of PsA. Left untreated, patients with PsA can have persistent inflammation, 
progressive joint damage, several physical limitations, and disability. For most patients, skin 
manifestations predate the arthritis. On average PsA is diagnosed 10 years after PSO appears, although 
in 15% of cases, PsA and PSO occur simultaneously, or PsA precedes the skin disease. Prognosis of PsA 
may range widely from a mild monoarthritic form with good prognosis to more than 50% progressing to 
an erosive and destructive polyarticular form, comparable with that in patients with RA. Axial forms may 
also range from mild to severe and disabling. 
Disease specific considerations when evaluating PsA include disease activity (both psoriasis and arthritis), 
axial and peripheral joint involvement, biologic measures of disease, measure of function, quality of life, 
measure of structural joint damage, enthesis and dactylitis, safety and global status assessment.  
Comorbidities that have an increased prevalence in patients with PsA compared to the general population 
include an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease in PsA patients. Autoimmune-related conditions 
(i.e., coeliac disease, uveitis, and autoimmune bowel disorders), synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperstosis, 
and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, depression, and anxiety are also noted to co-occur with PsA. 
Management 
Psoriatic arthritis is a multidimensional disease requiring a holistic approach to treatment, as patients 
suffer beyond their joints. While treatment of joints is key, patients also suffer from many other 
manifestations such as PSO (including nail PSO), enthesitis, and dactylitis, which affect their quality of life 
and are frequently troublesome to patients with additional burden. Patients often have varying levels of 
disease activity; therefore, achieving low levels of disease activity is key to improving a patient’s quality 
of life. International guidelines from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Group 
for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) recommend that treatment of 
PsA should be aimed at reaching the target of remission or alternatively low disease activity (EULAR; 
Gossec et al, 2020) or the lowest possible level of disease activity in all domains of disease (GRAPPA; 
Coates et al, 2022a). 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 10/234 
 
 
 
 
  
In the treatment of PsA, there are several options available including conventional disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic DMARDs 
(Vivekanantham et al, 2021). Conventional DMARDs (eg, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate [MTX], 
sulfasalazine [SSZ], and leflunomide [LEF]) are generally the first line of therapy. If the patient does not 
respond adequately to cDMARDs, a bDMARD or targeted-synthetic DMARD may be considered. Biologic 
DMARDs include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α inhibitors (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, 
golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitors (eg, secukinumab and ixekizumab), 
IL-12/IL-23 inhibitors (eg, ustekinumab), and IL-23 inhibitors (eg, risankizumab and guselkumab). 
Targeted synthetic DMARDs include as PDE4 inhibitors (eg, apremilast) and JAK inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib, 
upadacitinib).  
Although the availability of treatment options has expanded over the years, there is still an unmet need, 
in particular in patients who are not responsive to these treatments (defined as achieving American 
College of Rheumatology 20% [ACR20] response criteria) or who do not maintain a clinical response. 
Patients with PsA symptoms who are not adequately treated or not well controlled are at risk of 
irreversible life-long joint damage that impact the patient’s quality of life including mobility, ability to 
work, and control of pain.  
The long-term goals of therapy include improvement in symptoms of the disease, psoriatic plaque 
clearance, inhibition of disease progression, and prevention of bone destruction. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Bimekizumab is a humanised, full-length monoclonal antibody (mAb) of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
subclass with 2 identical antigen binding regions that selectively bind with high affinity and neutralise IL-
17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF cytokines. Antibodies targeting IL-17A cytokines have demonstrated efficacy in 
patients with axSpA, PSO, and PsA. 
Bimekizumab has been granted marketing authorisation in the EU for the treatment of moderate to 
severe plaque PSO. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
A Phase 1b proof-of-concept study in participants with active PsA (PA0007) demonstrated a strong 
efficacy signal that warranted further exploration of bimekizumab in this indication, and UCB initiated a 
full development program in active PsA in adults.  
A Phase 2b, dose-ranging study (PA0008) was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of various 
bimekizumab dose regimens in study participants with active PsA (doses ranging from bimekizumab 
16mg to 320mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]). Data from this Phase 2b study led to dose selection of 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W for the Phase 3 studies, and further data from the follow-on open-label 
extension (OLE) study (PA0009) helped to confirm long term safety of bimekizumab at the 160mg Q4W 
dose.  
Finally, 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab 
for the treatment of active PsA: PA0010 (BE OPTIMAL) and PA0011 (BE COMPLETE). A safety data cut of 
the ongoing Phase 3 OLE study (PA0012) also contributed to the body of evidence supporting the safety 
evaluation for bimekizumab in this population. 
Prior to initiating the global Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, EMA Scientific Advice was obtained on the 
clinical development plan in PsA in July 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3306/2/2016/II). The overall updated Phase 3 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 11/234 
 
 
 
 
  
program for PsA was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Subsequently, a number of modifications were 
incorporated into the program considering the advice provided by EMA, the results from the Phase 2b 
dose-ranging study (PA0008), and the End of Phase 2 (EOP2) feedback from FDA (Aug 2018).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted additional pharmacology studies in support of the proposed indication in PsA and an 
update to the carcinogenicity assessment document with most recent publications. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro pharmacodynamics 
IL-17F is produced in larger amounts than IL-17A by innate immune cells and independently of IL-23 
Interleukin-17A and IL-17F are produced by cells from the adaptive and innate immune system. Flow 
cytometry was used to examine the capability of mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) and γδ 
T cells (innate immune system) and cluster differentiation (CD)4+ T cells (adaptive immune system) from 
peripheral blood from 5 human donors to produce IL-17A and IL-17F in response to T cell receptor (TCR) 
stimulation with or without IL-12/IL-18 and in the presence or absence of an antibody neutralising IL-23. 
CD8+ MAIT cells produce negligible amounts of IL-17A or IL-17F upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation alone. 
Following addition of IL-12 and IL-18, both cytokines were produced with a strong bias towards IL-17F, 
which is independent of IL-23. The majority of IL-17A and IL-17F produced from CD8+ T cells was shown 
to be issued from MAIT cells (identified as Vα7.2+CD161+CD8+) (Figure 1). 
As MAIT cells, γδ T cells produced very little IL-17A or IL-17F upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation alone and 
produced mainly IL-17F upon addition of IL-12 and IL-18 but independently of the presence of IL-23 
(Figure 2). 
In contrast, CD4+ T cells produced IL-17A and IL-17F upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation alone, which was 
reduced by an IL-23 neutralising antibody.

MAIT cells were significant contributors to the production of total IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF in the 
presence of IL-12/IL-18 whereas CD4 cells were the main contributors under TCR stimulation (Figure 3). 
Figure 3: Proportion of IL-17 isoforms produced by MAIT, CD4 or γδ T cells as compared to 
total cells number 
Based on these in vitro experiments, innate-like T cells such as MAIT and γδT cells can produce IL-17A 
and IL-17F, with a bias towards greater IL-17F, upon stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, which is IL-23 
independent. In contrast, adaptive CD4+ T cells show greater dependency on IL-23.

Il-17F plays an important role in psoriatic arthritis (Glatt et al, 2018) 
The MAH has demonstrated the presence of both IL-17A and IL-17F in synovial tissue from patients with 
PsA using mRNA expression analysis. The 2 cytokines induce the release of inflammatory mediators by 
signaling through the receptor complex IL17RA/RC present in both synoviocytes and skin cells. Whereas 
neither IL-17A nor IL-17F demonstrate substantial activity by themselves, their potency is significantly 
increased in the presence of TNFα. 
The inhibition of both IL-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab or a cocktail of antibodies against IL-17A and 
IL-17F blocked more effectively the production of IL-8 and MMP3 by synoviocytes from patients with PsA 
stimulated by the supernatant of polyclonal Th17 cells than antibodies selectively inhibiting each of the 
cytokines. Similar results were obtained on the secretion of IL-8 by normal dermal fibroblasts. 
Bimekizumab also induced a more profound down regulation of a large panel of inflammation-related 
genes in synoviocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts stimulated by Th17 cell supernatants than 
inhibition of IL-17A alone and confirmed a more profound inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis than 
antibodies neutralising selectively each of the cytokines as previously demonstrated (Study 40001876). 
Altogether, these results suggest that although IL-17F appears to be less potent than IL-17A, it plays an 
important role in chronic inflammation. 
IL-17F potently enhances osteogenic differentiation from human periosteum-derived cells and in vitro 
bone formation (Shah et al, 2020) 
The MAH has demonstrated that IL-17A and IL-17F potently enhance osteogenic differentiation from 
human periosteum-derived cells and in vitro bone formation from human periosteal cells that are 
hypothesised to orchestrate pathological bone formation in AS. These effects are more efficiently inhibited 
by bimekizumab than by the specific inhibition of IL-17A or IL-17F. 
IL-17A and IL-17F induce the transient expression of the periosteal stem cell marker SOSTDC1 indicating 
differentiation away from a ‘stem cell’ phenotype and the simultaneous increased expression of the osteo-
commitment marker RUNX2, the IL-17A and IL-17F receptors and BMP2. The 2 cytokines are 
approximately equipotent in enhancing osteogenic differentiation based on the determination of markers 
SP7, BGLAP, VEGFA and PHOSPHO1. γδ T cells or Th17 cell supernatants (containing IL-17A and IL-17F) 
induce potent increases in all osteogenic markers and in matrix mineralisation in human periosteum-
derived cells. Serum from AS patients also promotes the osteogenic differentiation of human periosteum-
derived cell as suggested by increased RUNX2 expression.  
The dual neutralisation of IL-17A and IL-17F induces a deeper suppression of osteogenic gene expression 
in human periosteum-derived cells than the neutralisation of either cytokine alone and a suppression of 
matrix mineralisation. Similarly, the pre-incubation of serum from 2 out of 3 AS patients with 
bimekizumab more effectively blocks RUNX2 expression in human periostal derived cells than the 
preincubation with antibodies specific to IL-17A or IL-17F (Shah et al, 2020). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Bimekizumab is an IgG1 with a potent Fc function that can be influenced by the structure of the N-linked 
oligosaccharide moiety of the CH2 region of the Fc domain. However, the mechanism of action of 
bimekizumab (binding soluble IL-17A and IL-17F to prevent their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC 
complex) does not involve the Fc effector function. In these conditions, the risk of Fc effector-driven 
adverse events (cytotoxicity) is low, and the composition of the N-linked oligosaccharide moiety is not 
expected to influence the efficacy or potency (Jiang et al, 2011). The absence of risk for antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was 
nevertheless assessed using in vitro assays. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 14/234 
 
 
 
 
  
ADCC was previously investigated by evaluating the viability of normal human dermal fibroblasts (effector 
cells) pre-stimulated with human IL-17A or IL-17F and cultured with natural killer (NK) effector cells in 
the presence of bimekizumab (Study 40001865). To address a question raised during the review of the 
initial MA for the PSO indication, the risk of ADCC and CDC was evaluated on IL-17-producing cells. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were preincubated with anti- CD28 and anti-CD3 antibodies (IL-17-
producing cells) and therefore incubated with complement active human serum and increasing 
concentrations of bimekizumab or secukinumab (IgG1 anti-IL-17A, used as negative control). Under the 
experimental conditions, none of the antibodies induced CD4+ IL-17+ T cell depletion; by contrast 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with complement active human serum and increasing 
concentrations of ocrelizumab or rituximab (with known ADCC and CDC properties for B cells) led to 
depletion of CD20+ B cells (Study 40001929). Results showed that bimekizumab does not elicit Fc 
receptor mediated cytotoxicity, either by ADCC or by CDC on IL-17 effector cells or on IL-17-producing 
cells. 
2.2.3.  Toxicology 
Carcinogenicity 
The CAD reviewing the full weight-of-evidence for the role of IL-17A and IL-17F in carcinogenesis and 
tumor progression, the mode of action of bimekizumab, information from in vitro and in vivo tumor 
models, published data from patients with tumors, and published safety data has been updated with most 
recent publications on therapeutic antibodies targeting the IL-17 pathway for the PSO, PsA, and AS 
indications. 
Published safety data from marketed antibodies targeting IL-17A or IL-17RA demonstrated no increased 
risk of tumor so far for PSO, PsA, or AS (Genovese et al, 2020; Combe et al, 2020; Lebwohl et al, 2021). 
2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bimekizumab does not contain non-natural amino acids or modifications. It is expected to be subject to 
the same in vivo degradation pathways as natural proteins and to have the same environmental impact 
as naturally occurring human antibodies. According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment on Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides 
and proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Consequently, no Environmental Risk Assessment for bimekizumab is required. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has presented a number of in vitro pharmacodynamic studies with relevance to the proposed 
indication in psoriatic arthritis (as concerns this procedure) and axial spondyloarthritis (parallel 
procedure, no. EMEA/H/C/005316/II/0010). Some of the data presented is relevant to both indications.   
The rationale for IL-17F modification in PsA is supported by the presence of elevated IL-17A and IL-17F in 
the dermis of psoriatic skin, the synovium of psoriatic arthritic patients and higher levels of circulating 
cytokines in these patients. Dual IL-17A/IL-17F modulation of inflammatory disease pathology suggests 
an important role of innate cells, independent of IL-23 signalling. Dual inhibition with bimekizumab is 
associated with reduced IL-8 and MMP in synoviocytes isolated from PsA patients. IL-17A and IL-17F are 
pro-osteogenic cytokines and can induce osteogenic markers, including BMP2 and RUNX2, the latter of 
which has been observed at elevated levels in the serum of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Pre-
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 15/234 
 
 
 
 
  
incubation of AS serum with bimekizumab reduced RUNX2 expression to a greater extent than antibodies 
targeting either IL-17A or IL-17F alone. Although these findings were limited to AS patients, enhanced 
bone formation and bony swelling of the joints is a common and debilitating feature of PsA. Overall, the 
pharmacodynamic studies discussed provide a solid rationale for the use of bimekizumab in PsA. The 
proposed updates to section 5.1 of the SmPC (mechanism of action) are considered acceptable.  
The MAH also provided an update to the Carcinogenicity Assessment Document. Evidence collected in the 
post-marketing setting with other IL-17 inhibitors do not indicate an increased risk of malignancies in 
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. This is acknowledged.  
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package submitted in support of an indication in psoriatic arthritis is acceptable. 
Bimekizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
In the context of this new indication for the treatment of adults with PsA, additional PK data were 
collected and submitted. Bimekizumab doses ranged from 16 mg up to 480 mg. 
A total of 4 efficacy safety studies (Phase 2 and 3) provided supportive data including PK, PD, and 
immunogenicity of bimekizumab in study participants with PsA: a Phase 2b, dose-ranging study (PA0008) 
and its follow-on Phase 2b open-label extension (OLE) study (PA0009), and 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies 
(PA0010 and PA0011) to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab for the treatment of 
active PsA. A Phase 3 OLE study (PA0012) is ongoing.  
One clinical-use device sub-study (DV0004) supporting the self-injection of bimekizumab by participants 
with PsA was also provided (sub-study of PA0012 study). 
Final PK data from the 2 PsA studies (PA0008 and PA0009) were described, as well as a description of the 
interim PK data up to week 24 of PA0010 and final data from PA0011 and DV0004. 
Sparse PK sampling was performed. The majority of the PK samples were collected prior to dosing and 
reflected plasma trough concentrations. Bimekizumab concentrations in these studies were summarised 
with descriptive statistics and were also included in an updated integrated population PK analysis of 
bimekizumab on pooled data from phase 2 and phase 3 studies including participants with PsA, axSpA, or 
moderate to severe PSO (CL0538 report). The derived PK parameters were subsequently combined with 
the PD dataset for the population PK/PD modelling of ACR and PASI response following bimekizumab 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 16/234 
 
 
 
 
  
subcutaneous administration in phase 2 and phase 3 study participants with PsA (CL0540 report). Both 
the population PK and PK/PD analyses were performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. 
The table below gives an overview of the studies contributing data to the PsA summary of clinical 
pharmacology: 
The Phase 1 study in participants with active PsA, PA0007, was the first multiple-dose clinical study 
conducted with bimekizumab. This study utilised intravenous (iv) administration of bimekizumab and 
evaluated safety, PK, and PD in study participants with PsA who had an inadequate response to at least 1 
non-biologic DMARD and/or 1 approved biologic DMARD. Bimekizumab treatment duration was 6 weeks, 
with study participants receiving a loading dose on Week 1 followed by a maintenance dose at Weeks 4 
and 7. The loading/maintenance doses used were 80/40mg (N=6), 160/80mg (N=6), 240/160mg 
(N=20), and 560/320mg (N=6) and were administered via IV infusion. Results demonstrated that, 
following multiple iv administrations of bimekizumab, the PK was linear across the tested dose range. 
Clinically relevant effects were observed on both skin and joints in study participants with PsA.

Bioanalytical methods 
An overview of the bioanalytical methods used for analyses of plasma bimekizumab concentrations (4 
methods), anti-bimekizumab antibody (ADAb) assessments (5 methods), and anti-bimekizumab NAb 
determination (1 method with 2 parts [IL-17AA and IL-17FF specific]) in clinical studies relevant to the 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), and psoriasis (PSO) indications are shown in 
Table 1 (study numbers related to the PsA and axSpA submissions are in bold font). 
Table 1: Bioanalytical methods used
Determination of bimekizumab concentrations in plasma 
Method life cycle information for each of the 4 PK methods is presented in Table 2. PK Method #1 was 
developed and used to analyse samples in Phase 1 studies (except UP0033, UP0034, and UP0067) and all 
PsA, axSpA, and PSO Phase 2 studies (except PA0009). The method is based on coating with anti-
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 18/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
bimekizumab idiotypic antibody and detection with a sheep anti-human IgG1 antibody. PK Method #1 
was updated into PK Method #2 to yield improved robustness going into the Phase 2 studies PA0009 and 
AS0013 (and was also used in the Phase 3 PSO studies). The main improvements for PK Method #2 were 
based on using both coating and detection with anti-bimekizumab idiotypic antibodies and raising the 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to 250ng/mL. For future testing, PK Method #2 was transferred 
successfully to another vendor and validated as PK Method #3. PK Method #3 was used for the Phase 3 
studies in PsA and axSpA as well as the stand-alone study UP0034. PK Method #3 was transferred to a 
Chinese vendor and validated as PK Method #4. Subsequently, PK Method #4 was cross-validated with PK 
Method #3. Thus far, PK Method #4 has only been used in the Chinese Phase 1 study UP0067. PK Method 
#1 and PK Method #2 were cross-validated to facilitate population PK analysis using combined data from 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies.

Antidrug antibody methods 
The ADAb assay was optimised during clinical development with respect to 1) development of a tiered 
analysis approach and changing from quantitative evaluation using a calibrator curve to semi-quantitative 
titer evaluation, and 2) optimisation regarding drug and target tolerance requirements. The ADAb data in 
the clinical studies were generated using bioanalytical methods that were validated according to the 
relevant guidelines at the time of validation. 
The characteristics of the different ADAb assays and the contract research organization laboratories 
responsible for the validations are summarised in Table 3.  
In support of the early clinical studies, e.g., PA0007, a homogenous Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)-based 
ADAb assay was used applying a calibration curve (ADAb-1). Presence of ADAb was only evaluated using 
a screening and confirmatory assay (drug displacement assay), no titration was performed. The level of 
ADAb was reported as unit/mL where 1 unit is equivalent to 1μg of calibrator. This assay was validated.  
The ADAb assay was redeveloped and re-established (ADAb-2), which included the transition from 
reporting relative concentration units to implementing a 3-tiered sample analysis approach, consisting of 
a screening assay, confirmatory assay (i.e. drug displacement assay to confirm the true positivity of the 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 20/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
ADAb-positive samples), and a titration assay to semi-quantify the ADAb responses. This assay was 
validated.  
Subsequently, this assay was improved (ADAb-3) and used in support of Phase 2 studies AS0008, 
AS0009, PA0008, and PA0009. This assay was validated. 
Based on the clinical ADAb data obtained during clinical development, the ADAb assay was further 
optimised to improve target tolerance to allow sensitive detection of treatment emergent ADAb during the 
drug treatment period. This assay was validated (ADAb-4) and used in analysis of samples from AS0013.  
Subsequently, this assay was transferred and validated (ADAb-5) and used in UP0067 and Phase 3 
studies PS0015, AS0010, AS0011, PA0010, PA0011, and PA0012 (including substudy DV0004). 
Supplemental validation was performed to establish additional freeze/thaw stability, drug tolerance 
assessment in the confirmatory tier, and additional positive control qualification. 
Although the same assay was validated at 2 CROs (ADAb-4 and ADAb-5), the ADAb samples within a 
clinical study were analysed by only 1 laboratory. In addition, all samples from the pivotal Phase 3 studies 
were analysed using the same method (i.e. ADAb-5) allowing for the data to be pooled. Therefore, no 
formal reproducibility evaluation was performed to establish full comparison of the data produced by each 
laboratory as the samples within a study were only evaluated by one laboratory. However, as 
demonstrated in Table 3, the assay performance characteristics between both laboratories are 
comparable. 
Statistical assessment of the cut points was performed according to the white paper of Devanarayan et al, 
2017 and screening, confirmatory, and titre cut points were determined. Statistical evaluation was 
performed to evaluate study-specific false positivity rate and to compare validation cut points with those 
assessed in-study.

Determination of neutralising antibodies 
The competitive ligand binding assay (CLBA) method comprises 2 NAb assays, with specificity for IL-17AA 
and IL-17FF, respectively. In these NAb assays, ADAb compete with labelled target to bind to the drug. 
Neutralisation of IL-17AA and IL-17FF binding to the drug is assessed in each respective assay 
separately. Both NAb assays are electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based assays using solid-phase 
extraction with acid dissociation (SPEAD) sample pre-treatment. To remove any interfering drug 
potentially present in the samples, a 2-step acid dissociation was utilised. In the first step, samples were 
acidified to dissociate any potential NAb immune complexes. Biotinylated drug to compete with unlabelled 
drug was added to the acidic solution. The acidic solution was neutralised directly on a streptavidin-
coated high bind plate to capture the biotinylated drug/NAb complexes. After incubation and washing, the 
ADAb/NAb present were dissociated from the biotinylated drug through acidic conditions (second acid 
step; NAb elution). In parallel, streptavidin MSD plates were blocked and coated with a defined amount of 
biotinylated drug. Acidified supernatants were split in halves and transferred to the precoated MSD plates 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 22/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
for detection with target IL-17AA or IL-17FF, respectively. The acidic supernatants were directly 
neutralised on the respective MSD plates and incubated. Detection of the resulting drug/NAb immune 
complexes was achieved through competition of the NAb with labelled IL-17AA or IL-17FF, respectively. 
Bound target was detected by ECL using an MSD reader. In these CLBAs, potential NAb present in the 
samples will concentration-dependently reduce the ECL signal. This approach assured sufficient drug and 
target tolerance to allow for an accurate determination of NAb levels in clinical samples. In addition, 
specificity testing using an UCB4940 framework control human IgG1 antibody consisting of drug identical 
framework and unrelated complementarity determining regions, demonstrated that the current CLBA 
assays are specific for determining the neutralising capacity of bimekizumab. The neutralising antibody 
assays are only composed of a screening tier. 
Statistical evaluations were performed to determine both validation and study-specific cut points. 
Statistical reports, including justification of the cut point strategy, are appended to the study specific NAb 
analytical reports.  
The NAb assays were developed and validated. In addition, based on evaluation from the PSO submission 
studies, the NAb assays were partially revalidated to verify the assay sensitivity and the suitability of the 
assay controls. Assay characteristics and detailed summaries of the (re) validation parameters were 
submitted by the MAH. The NAb methods were used in support of the Phase 3 studies PS0015, AS0010, 
AS0011, PA0010, PA0011, and PA0012. 
Bioavailability 
No additional bioavailability or bioequivalence studies have been conducted to specifically support the PsA 
indication. However, additional considerations for the PsA indications regarding bioavailability are outlined 
below for study DV0004. 
Device use study (DV0004) 
DV0004 was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomised, non-comparator, North America and Europe 
substudy to PA0012. PA0012 is an ongoing study evaluating the long-term safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of bimekizumab in adult study participants with PsA who completed 1 of the feeder studies 
(PA0010 or PA0011). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 self-injecting device 
presentations (ie, 1mL bimekizumab auto-injector [bimekizumab-AI-1mL] and 1mL bimekizumab safety 
syringe [bimekizumab-SS-1mL]) and self-administered bimekizumab at Baseline and at Week 4 in the 
thigh or abdomen. Within each device presentation arm, study participants were divided into tertiles by 
BMI. Bimekizumab trough concentrations were collected at baseline, Week 4 and Week 8. 
Data supporting self-injection 
The GeoMean trough concentrations at Week 4 and Week 8 (associated with self-injection at the previous 
visits using the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1m device presentations) were similar to 
those at Baseline (associated with the last injection by study personnel in the feeder study using the 1mL 
PFS). Summary statistics and boxplots of trough bimekizumab plasma concentration by visit and by 
device presentation are presented below:

Data supporting sites of injection 
Within both the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL groups, the trough bimekizumab plasma 
concentrations between injection sites tended to be similar and the ranges overlapped across all 3 visits, 
regardless of whether the previous dose had been self-administered or given by study personnel.

Data supporting use across different BMI tertiles 
In both the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL groups, trough concentrations decreased as 
BMI increased with the lowest geometric mean trough bimekizumab plasma concentrations generally 
observed for study participants in the highest BMI tertile. Within each tertile, the trough bimekizumab 
concentrations were reasonably similar regardless of whether the previous dose was self-administered or 
administered by the study personnel. Summary statistics and boxplots of bimekizumab plasma 
concentration by BMI tertile after self-injection or injection by study personnel are presented for each 
device presentation below:

Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Phase 2 studies 
Study PA0008 
PA0008 was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, dose-
ranging study in adult study participants with active PsA. This study included 4 periods: a Screening 
Period (4 weeks, washout of medications during this period), a Double-blind Period (12 weeks), a Dose-
blind Period (36 weeks) and a Safety Follow-up (SFU) Visit (20 weeks after the last dose).  
During the Double-blind Period, a total of 206 study participants were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 (stratified by 
region and prior tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitor exposure) to five groups: placebo (N=42), or to 
receive bimekizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) at doses of 16mg (N=41), 160mg (N=41), 
320mg (N=41), or with a 320mg loading dose followed by 160mg (from this point on referred to as 
160mgLD) (N=41). Blood samples for bimekizumab concentrations during the Double-Blind Period were 
taken at Baseline, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
After the 12-week Double-blind Period, 199 study participants entered the 36-week Dose-blind Period. At 
the Week 12 Visit, study participants were allocated to bimekizumab treatment regimens as follows; 
study participants in the placebo or bimekizumab 16mg Q4W groups were re-randomised in a 1:1 fashion 
to bimekizumab 160mg or bimekizumab 320mg Q4W; study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg or 
160mg LD dose groups continued to receive bimekizumab 160mg Q4W; and study participants in the 
bimekizumab 320mg dose group continued to receive bimekizumab 320mg Q4W. Blood samples for 
bimekizumab concentrations during the Dose-Blind Period were taken at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 36 and 48. 
Patients may have received 1 prior TNF inhibitor. The following restrictions were applied for bDMARDs: 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 28/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
As shown in Figure 7 below, geometric mean plasma bimekizumab concentrations increased in a dose 
proportional manner during the Double-blind Period for the Pharmacokinetic Per Protocol Set (PK-PPS). 
Plasma concentrations in the 320mg and 160mg LD groups were similar through Week 4 and afterwards 
the plasma concentrations of 160mg LD were more similar over time to the 160mg group. For study 
participants in the 3 highest bimekizumab dose groups (who remained on the same dose after Week 12), 
steady state in plasma bimekizumab concentrations was achieved between Weeks 16 and 20. 
Figure 7: Bimekizumab concentrations (µg/mL) by week (Overall; PK-PPS) 
Figure 8 summarises plasma concentrations of bimekizumab by visit for the overall study and by 
treatment group for the subset of study participants in the Dose Blind Set who were part of the PK-PPS. 
For study participants initially randomised to placebo or bimekizumab 16mg, after being re-randomised to 
bimekizumab 160mg or 320mg at Week 12, geometric mean plasma bimekizumab concentrations quickly 
increased and were similar to those of study participants initially randomised to bimekizumab 160mg 
(and 160mg w/LD) or 320mg through Week 48.

Study PA0009 
PA0009 was a Phase 2b multicenter, open-label extension study to assess the long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab in eligible adult study participants with psoriatic arthritis who 
completed the Phase 2b study PA0008.  
Bimekizumab was administered at a dose of 160mg Q4W upon entry into PA0009, regardless of the dose 
received in PA0008. The study duration for each participant was estimated to be up to a maximum of 120 
weeks and consisted of an open label treatment period of up to 100 weeks (~2 years). 183 participants 
received at least one dose of bimekizumab and 161 participants completed PA0009. Blood samples for 
bimekizumab concentrations were taken at the Entry Visit, and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 104. 
The following restrictions were applied for bDMARDs: 
A summary of plasma bimekizumab concentrations by visit is presented in Table 7 and Figure 9. Study 
participants who had received bimekizumab 160mg Q4W during PA0008 maintained relatively constant 
bimekizumab concentrations during the subsequent PA0009, indicating steady state had been achieved. 
Study participants who received bimekizumab 320mg Q4W during PA0008 had bimekizumab 
concentrations approximately 2 times higher than the bimekizumab 160mg group at Visit 1 (EV), then 
decreased to similar levels as the PA0008 160mg group at Week 12, which were steady state levels.

Phase 3 studies 
Study PA0010 
PA0010 is a Phase 3 multicenter study consisting of a 16-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, active-reference Treatment Period followed by a 36-week Active Treatment-Blind Period to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with active PsA. The data for 
this assessment is from an interim report up to Week 24. 
During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, participants were randomised to 160mg bimekizumab SC Q4W 
(n=431), adalimumab SC Q2W (n=140), and placebo (n=281). After the 16-week Double-Blind period 
into the 36-week Active Treatment-Blind Period, participants continued 160mg bimekizumab (n=414) or 
adalimumab (n=136), and participants in the placebo group received bimekizumab Q4W starting at week 
16 (n=271). Blood samples for bimekizumab concentrations during the study were taken at Baseline, and 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 52. 
Subjects with current or prior exposure to any biologics for the treatment of PsA or PSO were excluded. 
Figure 10 shows that geometric mean bimekizumab concentrations increased over time and steady state 
was achieved by Week 16 of dosing with 160mg Q4W. A 1.58-fold accumulation in geometric mean 
bimekizumab trough concentration was observed between Week 4 and Week 16, consistent with the 
expected accumulation of bimekizumab concentrations with repeat dosing. In the placebo/bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group, once study participants switched to bimekizumab treatment, the concentrations of 
bimekizumab followed similar trends to study participants randomized to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W at 
Baseline.

Study PA0011 
PA0011 was a Phase 3 multicenter study consisting of a 16-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in study participants with 
active PsA. 
A total of 400 study participants were randomised and started the Double-Blind Treatment Period as 
follows: 267 study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 133 study participants in the 
placebo group. Study participants who completed Week 16 and were eligible for enrollment in the open-
label extension (OLE) study, PA0012, continued to receive bimekizumab 160mg SC Q4W; a total of 388 
participants completed the Double-blind Period, and 378 participants entered the OLE study. Blood 
samples for bimekizumab concentrations during the study were taken at baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 
and 16. 
Study participants had a history of inadequate response or intolerance to treatment with 1 or 2 TNFα 
inhibitors for either PsA or PSO. Study participants with current or prior exposure to any biologics except 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the treatment of PsA or PSO were excluded. The following wash-
out periods were applied:

Figure 11 below summarises the geometric mean plasma bimekizumab concentrations up to Week 16 on 
linear and semi-logarithmic scales. The geometric mean plasma bimekizumab concentrations increased 
over time and a steady state was achieved by Week 16 of dosing with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. 
Concentrations were within the expected ranges at each visit, and the approach to steady state was 
consistent with the expectations for bimekizumab as a drug with linear PK. A 1.50-fold accumulation in 
geometric mean trough plasma bimekizumab concentration was observed between Week 4 and Week 16, 
consistent with the expected accumulation of bimekizumab concentrations with repeat dosing.

Population PK modelling 
The data for the present analysis originated from fifteen different Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies: PS0010, 
PS0011, PS0016, PS0008, PS0009, PS0013, PS0015, PA0008, PA0010, PA0011, PA0012, AS0008, 
AS0013, AS0010 and AS0011. In these studies, patients with PSO, PsA or axSpA had subcutaneous (SC) 
administrations of bimekizumab with various dosing regimens.  
Studies PS0015, PA0010, PA0011, PA0012, AS0010 and AS0011 were still ongoing at the time of the 
analysis and consequently interim data was used for these studies. The population PK analysis included 
all data available at Week 24 cut-off for studies PA0010, AS0010, and AS0011, and all data available at 
Week 16 cut-off for study PA0011, as well as the available data from study PA0012 at the time of the 
PA0011 data cut. For study PS0015, data up to week 48 (end of second treatment period) was included. 
The population PK analyses were performed in the non-linear mixed effect modeling software NONMEM 
version 7.4 or higher using the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) 
estimation. 
Covariate-parameter relationships were assessed using the stepwise covariate model building procedure 
(SCM) with adaptive scope reduction (ASR). The evaluated covariates were: body weight (WT), age, sex, 
race/region, disease indication, disease duration, methotrexate (MTX) use at Baseline, corticosteroids use 
at Baseline, conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) use at Baseline, 
prior anti-TNF therapy, prior use of biologics, ADAb and neutralising antibodies (NAb) status, anti-drug-
antibodies (ADAb) titer, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline, and liver function at 
Baseline. 
The dataset included 33,996 bimekizumab PK observations with multiple sc administrations across doses 
ranging from 16mg to 480mg and a total of 4010 patients (1809 with moderate to severe PSO, 1274 with 
PsA, and 927 with axSpA). The following observations were excluded: 1331 (3.8%) below LLOQ, 5 above 
LLOQ before the first active dose, 16 observations with duplicated records, and 1 observation associated 
with a double dose. 
Study participant characteristics for the PK analysis data set are presented by disease indication for: 
baseline continuous covariates (Table 10), baseline categorical covariates (Table 11), and combined ADAb 
and neutralising antibodies (NAb) status (Table 12).

The starting point of model development was based on the previous popPK model for bimekizumab in 
patients with PSO: a one-compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination, 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 37/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
including a covariate effect of WT on CL/F and V/F. A parameter for Frel was included, with a typical value 
fixed to 1. A two-compartment model was explored but did not provide a better fit of the PK data. Thus, 
the two-compartment model was not retained. 
The covariate testing identified the following statistically significant covariate-parameter relationships: 
WT, ADAb/NAb status, ADAb titer, hs-CRP, prior use of biologics, age, race, sex and total bilirubin on 
CL/F, WT on V/F, as well as age and disease indication on Frel. 
The final popPK model was a one compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. IIV 
terms were supported on CL/F, V/F and Frel. The RUV for bimekizumab was described by a proportional 
model and was associated with an exponential IIV term. Covariate effects included in the final model 
were WT on CL/F and V/F and race on CL/F. In the final model, the estimated exponent of WT effect on 
CL/F and V/F was 0.996 and 0.733, respectively. The impacts of other significant covariates identified in 
the covariate testing on PK parameters and steady-state exposures were small and not retained in the 
final model. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in CL/F or V/F between patients 
with PSO, PsA or axSpA and no evidence of statistically significant effects for concomitant use of MTX, 
csDMARDs or corticosteroids at Baseline on CL/F. 
The parameter estimates of the final bimekizumab population PK model, compared to the base model, are 
presented in Table 13. GOF plots are presented in Figure 12 (observed versus predicted concentrations) 
and Figure 13 (CWRES versus predicted concentrations and time). The GOF plots do not show any 
unacceptable trends overall. Figure 14 and Figure 15 present pcVPC plots for bimekizumab, stratified by 
phase of development and study, respectively. The figures show that the final bimekizumab model 
provides a good description of both the general trend and the variability in all studies.

Ctrough,ss, Tmax, t1/2 and accumulation ratio (AR) are presented in Table 13.  
Immunogenicity 
Phase 2 
Study PA0008 
PA0008 was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, dose-
ranging study in adult study participants with active PsA. This study included 4 periods: a Screening 
Period (4 weeks, washout of medications during this period), a Double-blind Period (12 weeks), a Dose-
blind Period (36 weeks) and a Safety Follow-up (SFU) Visit (20 weeks after the last dose). During the 
Double-Blind Period blood samples for Bimekizumab antibody detection were taken at Baseline, and 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12. During the Dose-Blind Period, blood samples for Bimekizumab antibody detection 
were taken at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 36 and 48. 
A summary of ADAb status by visit for the PK-PPS is presented in Table 14. Overall, the highest 
percentage of ADAb positive study participants occurred in the lowest dose group, bimekizumab 16mg 
(11 study participants; 26.8%); study participants only remained on this dose for 12 weeks before being 
re-randomised to a higher dose. The incidence of ADAb positivity consistently increased through Week 12 
in the bimekizumab 16mg group. For the 3 highest bimekizumab dose groups, ADAb status was 
determined through Week 48. The overall percentage of study participants who were ADAb positive at 
some point up to Week 48 in these dose groups was 25.6% (11 study participants) in the bimekizumab 
160mg group and 9.8% (4 study participants) each in the bimekizumab 160mg w/LD and bimekizumab 
320mg groups. The incidence of ADAb positivity was low across all visits in the bimekizumab 160mg w/LD 
and bimekizumab 320mg groups with no apparent temporal relationship.

The impact of ADAb on the PK of bimekizumab was determined, which was defined as a reduction in 
bimekizumab plasma concentrations by one-half in the presence of ADAb. Based on the above criteria, in 
3 of the 11 study participants in the bimekizumab 16mg group and 1 of the 4 study participants in the 
bimekizumab 160mg w/LD group who were ADAb positive, the presence of ADAb had an impact on 
bimekizumab plasma concentrations during the Double-blind Period. During the Dose-blind Period, the 
impact on plasma concentrations continued for only 1 study participant (from the 16mg group). At all 
other bimekizumab doses, the presence of ADAb did not have an impact on bimekizumab plasma 
concentrations.  
Study PA0009 
PA0009 was a Phase 2b multicenter open-label extension study to assess the long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab in eligible adult study participants with PsA who completed the 
Phase 2b study PA0008. During the study blood samples for Bimekizumab antibody detection were taken 
at the Entry Visit, and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 104. 
A summary of ADAb status in PA0009 is presented for the Safety Set in Table 15. The overall incidences 
of ADAb positivity in PA0009 alone were 18 study participants (16.5%) and 14 study participants (18.9%) 
for the PA0009 study participants who had received bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W at the completion of PA0008, respectively.

A summary of ADAb status in PA0008 and PA0009 overall is presented for the SS in Table 16. The overall 
incidences of ADAb positivity (study participant was considered ADAb positive if at least 1 assessment 
was confirmed positive at any time in the PA0008 and PA0009 Treatment Periods) were 25 study 
participants (22.9%) and 24 study participants (32.4%) for the PA0009 study participants who had 
received bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg Q4W at the completion of PA0008, 
respectively. Overall, ADAb status did not have an impact on the number of ACR50 responders.

Phase 3 
Study PA0010 
PA0010 is a Phase 3 multicenter study consisting of a 16-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, active-reference Treatment Period followed by a 36-week Active Treatment-Blind Period to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with active PsA. The data for 
this assessment are from an interim report up to Week 24. 
During the study, blood samples for Bimekizumab antibody detection were taken at the Baseline, and at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 52. 
Summaries of the overall ADAb incidences up to Week 16 and Week 24 and the number and percentage 
of study participants for each ADAb sub-category up to Week 24 are presented for the SS in Table 17. By 
Week 24, 36.4% of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had anti-drug antibodies, 
with low ADAb positive rates at Baseline and the majority of the ADAb positivity developed after 
bimekizumab treatment initiation (32.7% of study participants had treatment-emergent ADAb positive 
result in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group by Week 24). The plasma concentration levels of 
bimekizumab were slightly reduced in study participants who were ADAb positive compared with those 
who were ADAb negative. Anti-drug antibodies had no clear impact on clinical efficacy (ACR50 and 
PASI90) up to Week 24 or safety (TEAE incidence) of study participants treated with bimekizumab during 
the study.

Study PA0011 
PA0011 was a Phase 3 multicenter study consisting of a 16-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in study participants with active PsA. 
During the study, blood samples for bimekizumab antibody detection were taken at Baseline, and at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
Summaries of the overall ADAb incidences up to Week 16 and the number and percentage of study 
participants for each ADAb sub-category up to Week 24 are presented for the SS in Table 18. By Week 
16, 37.5% of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were ADAb positive, with low 
ADAb positive rates at Baseline and the majority of ADAb positivity developing after bimekizumab 
treatment initiation (33.3% of study participants who were pre-treatment ADAb negative became 
treatment emergent ADAb positive by SFU). The plasma concentrations of bimekizumab after 160mg 
Q4W dosing were lower in study participants who were NAb positive compared with those who were ADAb 
negative. However, anti-drug antibodies had no clear impact on clinical efficacy (ACR50 and PASI90) up 
to Week 16 or safety (TEAE incidence) of study participants treated with bimekizumab during the study.

Population PK and PK/PD modelling 
In the integrated popPK analysis, patients who were ADAb+/NAb+ were predicted to have 7% (95% CI 
5%–10%) faster CL/F than ADAb- patients. Therefore, steady-state AUC and Ctrough exposures were 
predicted to be 7% and 9% lower, respectively, in ADAb+/NAb+ patients, compared to ADAb- patients. 
Patients who were ADAb+/NAb- were predicted to have similar CL/F to those who were ADAb-. Patients 
with ADAb titer value of 788 (95th percentile of strictly positive ADAb titer values) were predicted to have 
9% (95% CI 9%–10%) faster CL/F compared to ADAb- patients. 
In the population PK/PD analyses, there was no evidence of a statistically significant impact for anti-drug-
antibodies (ADAb)/neutralising antibodies (NAb) status on PASI or ACR response rates. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been conducted in study participants to determine the effect of renal or hepatic 
impairment on the PK of bimekizumab. The renal elimination of intact bimekizumab, an IgG mAb, is 
expected to be low and of minor importance. Further, as a mAb, bimekizumab is not expected to be 
metabolised in the liver. Thus, no dose adjustment is proposed in these patient populations by the MAH. 
Age 
In the integrated popPK analysis (age range of 18.0 years to 85.0 years), compared to the reference 
value of 45 years old, patients aged 24 years old (5th percentile) were predicted to have 4% (95% CI 
3%-5%) faster CL/F and 7% (95% CI 5%–9%) higher Frel, while patients aged 68 years old (95th 
percentile) were predicted to have 4% (95% CI 3%–6%) slower CL/F and 7% (95% CI 5%–8%) lower 
Frel. Thus, the PK parameters were similar in the different age subgroups. A table with predicted 
bimekizumab exposures stratified by different age categories (< 65 years and ≥65 years and < 75 years 
and ≥75 years) is presented in Table 19.

Table 19: Simulated AUCss, Cmaxss, Ctroughss, Tmaxss and t1/2 stratified by different age 
categories assuming a 160 mg Q4W dosing regimen 
In the PK/PD model of ACR response, age was a statistically significant covariate on Emax; ACR response 
increased with decreasing age. The predicted Week 16 ACR50 response probability was 0.56 and 0.37 in 
study participants <45 and ≥45 years, respectively, following bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. The predicted 
Week 16 ACR50 response probability was 0.46 and 0.26 in study participants <65 and ≥65 years, 
respectively, following bimekizumab 160mg Q4W.  
Since age had no clinically relevant impact on bimekizumab PK, with the 95% CI of the PK parameters 
and exposure ratios falling completely within 0.8 to 1.25 compared to a typical participant, age-related 
changes in PK would not drive the predicted change in ACR50 response with age. Thus, according to the 
MAH, no dose adjustment for age is required. 
Gender 
In the PK/PD model of ACR response, sex was a statistically significant covariate on the probability of 
achieving an ACR response. The predicted Week 16 ACR50 response probability was 0.51 and 0.38 in 
males and females, respectively, following bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. This appears to be a PD-related 
sex effect rather than an effect driven by differences in PK. 
Based on the integrated popPK modelling, there was no evidence of a clinically relevant change in 
bimekizumab CL/F between males and females. Women were predicted to have 10% (95% CI 8%-12%) 
faster CL/F than men. Therefore, steady-state AUC and Ctrough exposures were predicted to be 9% and 
13% lower, respectively, in women, compared to men. Therefore, sex-related changes in PK would not 
drive the predicted change in ACR50 response. Thus, no dose adjustment for sex is required, according to 
the MAH. 
Race 
The similarity in PK between Japanese and Caucasian healthy study participants was demonstrated in the 
clinical study UP0042, which was presented in original PSO application. These results were also confirmed 
in the previous popPK model in patients with moderate to severe PSO and further supported by consistent 
findings from the popPK modelling across indications.  
In the integrated popPK model, Japanese patients were predicted to have 23% higher CL/F, and Chinese 
and other Asian patients were predicted to have 13% higher CL/F, compared to the reference Caucasian 
population. However, the effect of race on CL/F was less pronounced than the effect of WT. The median 
WTs in Japanese, Chinese and Caucasian patients were 69, 76 and 85 kg, respectively. Therefore, the 
smaller WTs in Japanese and Chinese patients offset the increase in CL/F and resulted in overall 
comparable PK exposure across the race subpopulations. The simulated AUCss, Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss 
for the 160 mg Q4W dose over 8 weeks are summarised for the reference race group (Caucasian, Black, 
American Indian or Alska Native, Hawaiian or other Pacific islander, missing and others, referred to as 
Caucasian), Chinese and other Asian (referred to as Chinese), and Japanese study participants in Table 
20.

Table 20: Median and 2.5th-97.5th AUCss, Cmaxss and Ctroughss over 8 weeks, stratified by 
race, assuming a 160 mg Q4W dosing regimen 
Keeping all PD covariates in the PK/PD model at the reference level (female, age of 49 years, baseline hs-
CRP of 4.5 mg/L), the predicted ACR50 probability at Week 16 was 0.35 for Japanese study participants 
weighing 103 kg, compared to 0.38 in study participants with typical PK parameters (WT=84 kg and 
Caucasian race). This 3% difference in response rates may be considered not clinically relevant. Thus, 
based on the overall data, no dose adjustment for race or ethnicity is required, according to the MAH. 
Bodyweight 
In the integrated popPK model, WT had the largest impact on CL/F and impacted V/F to a lesser extent. 
Compared to the reference WT of 84 kg, the steady-state AUC was predicted to be approximately 30% 
lower for a subject weighing 122 kg and 50% higher for a subject weighing 57 kg. According to the MAH, 
the predicted magnitude of drop in exposure for a patient weighing 122 kg is less likely to be seen in 
patients with PsA (or axSpA) compared to patients with PSO, since more than 95% of patients with PsA 
and axSpA in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies weighed less than 122 kg (the median WT for study 
participants with PSO, PsA and axSpA were 87.2, 84 and 79 kg, respectively). The simulated AUCss, 
Cmax,ss, Ctrough,ss, Tmax, t1/2 and accumulation ratio (AR), stratified by weight categories of < 120 kg 
and ≥120 kg, are presented in Table 21.  
Table 21: Median and 2.5th-97.5th AUCss, Cmaxss and Ctroughss over 8 weeks, stratified by 
dosing regimen and body weight category 
Baseline body weight was the covariate that had the largest impact on PK and PASI responses, 
respectively. Bimekizumab exposure decreased with increasing body weight, and higher body weight was 
predictive of longer PASI t1/2. Figure 18 shows the simulated median PASI75 and PASI90 profiles 
following 160mg Q4W dosing for subpopulations by 100kg and 120kg cut-offs. The PASI90 response rate 
appears to be more sensitive than PASI75 to the body weight effect. The simulations showed a ~12% 
difference in Week 48 PASI90 response rate for study participants weighing ≥120kg compared with 
<120kg, while a smaller difference (~8%) was predicted between study participants weighing ≥100kg 
compared with <100kg. The results suggest that patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe 
PSO weighing ≥120kg may benefit from an increased dose or dosing frequency to maintain maximal 
PASI90 responses.

Figure 18: Simulated median PASI75 and PASI90 response rates following 160mg Q4W dosing 
over time, stratified by body weight subgroups and response category (CL0540) 
Simulations based on the PK/PD model for ACR response were conducted with 160mg Q4W to evaluate 
the impact of decreasing exposure with increasing body weight. For patients with PsA overall, the Week 
16 ACR50 response probability ranged from 0.36 for a patient weighing 120kg (95th percentile for body 
weight) to 0.40 for a patient weighing 57kg (5th percentile for body weight) (Table 22). According to the 
MAH, these differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful and would not warrant dose 
adjustment by body weight in patients with PsA.

percentiles, assuming a 160mg Q4W dosing regimen (CL0540) 
Drug interactions 
No DDI studies have been conducted with bimekizumab. Given the mode of action of bimekizumab and 
studies conducted with other IL-17 and IL-23 antibodies, minimal impact is expected on the exposure of 
drugs metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 52/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
PopPK modelling found no evidence of a statistically significant impact of use of medications 
concomitantly administered with bimekizumab in rheumatologic indications (MTX, corticosteroids, or 
cDMARDs) on bimekizumab CL/F. In addition, there was no evidence of a statistically significant impact of 
use of these concomitant medications on either probability of achieving ACR response or Emax in the 
PK/PD analysis. 
In the original PSO application, results of UP0034 showed that bimekizumab did not have an impact on 
the production of antibody titers to the influenza vaccine.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Bimekizumab is a humanized, full-length immunoglobulin G1 anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody that 
selectively binds with high affinity to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with 
the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.  
Primary pharmacology 
Study PA0008 
PA0008 was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, dose-
ranging study in adult study participants with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This study included 4 
periods: a Screening Period (4 weeks, washout of medications during this period), a Double-blind Period 
(12 weeks), a Dose-blind Period (36 weeks) and a Safety Follow-up (SFU) Visit (20 weeks after the last 
dose). 
The PD variables were concentrations of cytokines of relevance to interleukin (IL)-17A/F signalling 
pathway and PsA biology, and included but were not limited to IL-17A, IL-23, IL-6, and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNFα). During the Double-Blind Period blood samples for cytokines, complement, and 
biomarker analysis were taken at Baseline, and Weeks 1, 4, and 12. During the Dose-Blind Period blood 
samples for cytokines, complement, and biomarker analysis were taken at Weeks 24 and 48. 
None of the cytokines or chemokines that were measured showed clinically relevant changes (where an 
appropriate number of data points were available) during the Double-blind Treatment Period, either with 
dose or with duration. No other PD analyses, outside of the efficacy analyses, were conducted in PA0008.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Bimekizumab is a mAb and is not expected to interact with the hERG channel. A thorough QT/QTc clinical 
study has therefore not been conducted. As described in the initial PSO application, there were no 
cardiovascular findings that could be attributed to treatment with bimekizumab during nonclinical 
evaluation in the Cynomolgus monkey (8-week study NCD2260 and the 26-week study NCD2450). 
Additionally, no notable trends in abnormal ECG findings were observed in the PsA clinical studies, and 
the incidence of major adverse cardiac events was low. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK/PD modelling of ACR and PASI response from Phase 2 studies 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 53/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Using data from the 12-week placebo-controlled period in PA0008, population PK and PK/PD models were 
developed to establish the dose-exposure-response relationship between bimekizumab and both 
ACR20/50/70 and PASI scores as well as the time courses of these endpoints (CL0464 and CL0463). 
These analyses were conducted to support the dose regimen selection for the pivotal Phase 3 studies in 
the PsA program. 
ACR response model 
For the popPK model, a total of 771 plasma bimekizumab concentration records from 159 study 
participants were available, while 986 ACR observations from 199 study participants were available for 
the ACR PK/PD model. The dependent variable (ACR 20/50/70) was a categorical variable, based on 20% 
improvement in ACR response (ACR20), 50% improvement in ACR response (ACR50) and 70% 
improvement in ACR response (ACR70). 
Bimekizumab PK was described by a one-compartment model with linear absorption and elimination. 
Body weight was a significant covariate on both CL/F and V/F, indicating plasma concentration decreased 
with increasing body weight. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to describe placebo and 
bimekizumab effects on ACR20/50/70 responses simultaneously. A latent variable captured the time 
delay between PK and bimekizumab effect while a serial correlation term with ACR kept the memory of 
the previous state.  
While body weight was found to be a covariate on both CL/F and V/F, the exposure-response analysis 
revealed that body weight did not impact ACR response rate. Baseline tender joint count (TJC) was found 
to be a significant covariate on the probability of achieving ACR50 response; study participants with 
higher Baseline TJC had lower ACR response. The higher Baseline TJC for the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
arm (median TJC of 19.00) partly explained the reduced Week 12 ACR50 response with this dose level 
compared with the bimekizumab 160mg dose groups (median TJCs of 14.00 and 16.00). None of the 
other covariates tested, including body mass index (BMI), Baseline swollen joint count, disease duration, 
sex, previous cDMARDs, prior biologics, number of cDMARDs, or study center, had a significant impact on 
ACR response. 
Simulations were performed using the PK/PD model to predict the dose response of Week 12 ACR20, 
ACR50, and ACR70 response rates. Based on the simulations, the maximum ACR response rate was 
predicted to be achieved with the 160mg Q4W dose (Figure 19). Higher doses, such as 320mg, were 
unlikely to provide additional benefit. 
Figure 19: Week 12 simulated ACR20/50/70 response rate (CL0464) 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 54/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
PASI response model 
For the population PK/PD model to describe the exposure-response relationship between plasma 
bimekizumab concentration and PASI score as well as the time course of PASI (CL0463), a total of 649 
PASI scores from 131 study participants were included in the analysis dataset. 
The PK/PD rate model was an indirect response model with a zero order production (Kin) and a first order 
elimination rate from the indirect response compartment (Kout, parameterized as PASI turnout t1/2). 
Bimekizumab changed the PASI score through inhibiting Kin. In this model, body weight was found to be 
a covariate on the turnout half-life, suggesting a longer time to achieve maximum PASI response in 
patients with higher body weight. Notably, simulations revealed only marginal differences in the time of 
maximum effect between participants with higher and lower body weight. None of the other covariates 
tested (including BMI, age, BSA, Baseline PASI, sex, race, or ADAb presence) had a significant impact on 
PASI.  
Simulations from the model indicated that PASI75 and PASI90 response rates were near maximal at 
160mg Q4W for the overall PsA population (with mostly mild to moderate skin disease). The simulations 
also indicated that doses lower than 160mg may provide reduced PASI75 and PASI90 responses (Figure 
20). While some improvement in Week 12 PASI90 was predicted with the 320mg Q4W regimen, the 
limited number of participants with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe PSO in study PA0008 
precluded robust assessment of PASI responses for this subgroup. Thus, the Phase 3 PsA program utilised 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W with no recommendation of other regimens for participants with concomitant 
moderate to severe PSO. 
Figure 20: Week 12 simulated PASI75 and PASI90 response rates (CL0463) 
The modelling results of CL0464 and CL0463 indicated that prior biologic use had no impact on PK/PD 
parameters; thus, in Phase 3 studies, bimekizumab 160mg Q4W was tested in both bDMARD-naïve 
participants (PA0010) and participants who were inadequate responders to ≤2 prior anti-TNFα treatments 
(PA0011).

Population PK-PD modelling of PASI and ACR response following bimekizumab subcutaneous 
administration in patients with psoriatic arthritis 
The aims of these analyses were to characterise the exposure-response relationships between 
bimekizumab plasma concentrations and the two efficacy endpoints, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response, in patients with PsA, using a population 
PK-PD modelling approach. The data originated from one completed studies PA0008, PA0010 and 
PA0011. 
The impact of the exploratory covariates was investigated using the SCM procedure with adaptive scope 
reduction. Covariates evaluated in the PK-PD models are presented in Table 23.

models 
ACR response model 
ACR 20/50/70 response was the primary efficacy endpoint in study participants with PsA. In total, 7124 
ACR response observations from 1314 patients with PsA were included in this analysis.  
The final ACR response model was a proportional odds model with a treatment effect (placebo and drug 
effects). The probabilities of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response were a function of the baseline 
probabilities, the placebo effect, which increased with increasing time (log-linear relationship), and the 
drug effect, which increased with increasing bimekizumab plasma concentration and increasing time. The 
active drug model was constituted of an Emax function of the individual bimekizumab plasma 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 57/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
concentration, and an exponential decay function of time. The EC90 was 14.6 μg/mL in the final model. 
The median Ctrough,ss for a 160 mg Q4W dosing regimen is 10.7 μg/mL, which corresponds to EC87 
(i.e., concentration at 87% maximum effect). The model predicted the largest increase in drug effect, 
independent of concentration, to be achieved by approximately Week 6, which supports fast onset of 
bimekizumab effect on ACR response in patients with PsA. 
The final model included the effect of age and baseline high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on 
Emax, as well as the effect of sex on the probability of response. Under active treatment, the probability 
of ACR response increased with decreasing age and with increasing baseline hs-CRP. Males had higher 
probability of ACR response than females. There was no evidence of a statistically significant impact for 
ADAb/NAb status, use of concomitant medications at baseline (MTX, csDMARDs or corticosteroids) or 
disease duration on either probability of ACR response or Emax.  
The parameter estimates of the final ACR response model, compared to the base model, are presented in 
Table 24. VPC plots for the final model are presented in Figure 21 and Figure 22. These figures 
demonstrate that the final ACR response model provides a good description of the observed data overall.

Forest plots based on the final model for the predicted probabilities of ACR response at Week 16 are 
presented in Figure 23. 
Figure 23: Forest plots based on the final ACR response model. The impact of identified 
covariates on the week 16 ACR response probabilities was evaluated at the values shown on

median and 95% CI of the mean probabilities for the different covariate subgroups. The plot is 
based on 250 parameter samples obtained from the NONMEM variance-covariance matrix. 
Simulations were performed to assess the impact of change in PK parameters on the predicted 
probabilities of ACR response, following 160 mg Q4W. The results are presented in Figure 24, which 
shows minor changes in ACR response probabilities with changing CL/F. This indicates a shallow ER 
relationship around 160 mg Q4W. An increase of 20% in bimekizumab CL/F led to a decrease of 1.4% in 
the median predicted probability of ACR50 at Week 16. A decrease of 20% in bimekizumab CL/F led to an 
increase of 1.6% in the median predicted probability of ACR50 at Week 16.

160 mg Q4W. 
The simulated probabilities of ACR response at Week 16 for different dose levels are presented in Figure 
25. The dose-response relationship was steep with the ACR response reaching a plateau by 160 mg Q4W. 
The predicted probability of ACR50 response at Week 16 were 0.04, 0.15, 0.33, 0.38, 0.39, and 0.41 for 
placebo, 16 mg Q4W, 80 mg Q4W, 160 mg Q4W, 320 mg loading dose, followed by 160 mg Q4W and 
320 mg Q4W dosing regimens, respectively. Further, the ACR response was predicted to be relatively 
similar between the 10th and the 90th bimekizumab concentration percentiles (ACR50 response rate 
ranged from 0.32 to 0.41).

samples of 862 simulated study participants, with dose administered Q4W.  
PASI response model  
In total, 5079 PASI response observations from 757 patients with PsA were included in this analysis. The 
dependent variable (DV) was the PASI score. The starting model, an indirect response model describing 
the time course of PASI score, was based on the legacy model developed with phase 2 data to inform 
phase 3 dose selection.  
The final PASI model was an indirect response model with a treatment effect (placebo and active drug 
effects) affecting the production rate (kin). The elimination rate constant kout was expressed in the 
model as the t1/2 of PASI response (kout = ln(2)/PASI t1/2). The model supported a PASI t1/2 of 10.7 
days for a typical subject weighing 85.5 kg in the PASI analysis data set. Thus, the time to reach half-
maximal PASI reduction with steady-state concentration is estimated to be approximately 1.5 weeks. The 
PASI t1/2 value was fixed in the final model with an IIV reflecting variation between individuals in the 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 63/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
rate of PASI change and time to achieve maximum PASI reduction. Exploratory and modelling analysis 
supported that the placebo effect was constant during the 16-week initial period of the study. Thus, 
placebo effect (Eplac) was estimated by a single maximum placebo effect parameter, with IIV, inhibiting 
kin after placebo dose. The drug effect (Edrug) was an Emax function of the individual predicted 
bimekizumab plasma concentrations. 
The final PASI model included the following covariates: prior use of biologics and study (PA0008) on 
baseline PASI and body weight on PASI half-life (t1/2). There was no evidence of a statistically significant 
impact for anti-drug-antibodies (ADAb)/neutralizing antibodies (NAb) status, use of concomitant 
medications at baseline (MTX, csDMARDs or corticosteroids), markers of baseline disease severity 
(baseline PASI score, baseline percentage of BSA affected by PSO or baseline hs-CRP) or disease duration 
on parameters of placebo or drug effects in the model. 
Although prior biologics use was identified as a statistically significant covariate, patients with prior 
biologics use had an estimated 16% higher baseline PASI score compared with biologic naive patients, 
and there did not appear to be a large difference in either the PASI75 or PASI90 response rates at Week 
48, between the two sub-populations. Study PA0008 was estimated to have a slightly lower baseline PASI 
score (~20% lower) compared with studies PA0010 and PA0011. 
The developed population PK-PD model provided a good description of the ER relationship between 
bimekizumab concentrations and PASI score. The parameter estimates of the final PASI model are 
presented in Table 25. Figure 26 presents pcVPC plots for the PASI score, stratified by study. The pcVPC 
plots show that the final PASI model provides an adequate description of both the general trend and the 
variability in all studies. A VPC of the response rate is presented in Figure 27. The VPC illustrates that 
PASI75 and PASI90 response rates are adequately captured by the model. However, the model predicts 
no response for subjects on placebo, while a slight response was observed.

Simulations were performed to assess the dose-response for PASI75 and PASI90 response rates and

80, 160 and 320 mg Q4W), Figure 28. Covariate distributions (including baseline PASI), as well as 
individual PK parameters were kept but all subjects were assumed to have no prior biologics therapy. The 
Week 16 PASI75 and PASI90 response rates increased with increasing dose (Table 26). Compared to 160 
mg Q4W, the simulations showed more prominent effect for the higher dose regimen of 320 mg Q4W on 
week 16 PASI90 than PASI75 response rates. The time course of PASI90 response rate also 
demonstrated faster onset of response after treatment initiation with 320 mg Q4W compared with 160 
mg Q4W.

The impact of identified covariates on the PASI75 and PASI90 response rates was assessed by 
simulations. Patients with prior use of biologics had slightly higher baseline PASI. There was no relevant 
difference in either PASI75 or PASI90 response rates between these sub-populations (Figure 29).

Figure 29: Simulated PASI75 and PASI90 response rates versus time since first dose, stratified

analysis dataset population. Subjects were treated with bimekizumab160mg Q4W during 48 
weeks. The solid lines and the shaded areas represent the median and the 95% PI of the PASI 
response rates, respectively.  
PASI t1/2 increased with increasing WT. The PASI t1/2 was predicted to increase by 22% and 53% for a 
patient weighing 100 and 120 kg, respectively, compared to a typical patient (85.5 kg). Thus, the time to 
achieve half-maximal PASI reduction with steady-state concentrations is estimated to be approximately 
13 and 16 days in subjects weighing 100 kg and 120 kg, respectively. WT also impacted bimekizumab 
exposure and PASI90 response rate appeared to be more sensitive to body weight changes compared 
with PASI75. Simulations based on the final PASI model in study participants with PsA showed that 
participants weighing ≥120kg had a ~12% lower PASI90 response rate at Week 48 compared with 
participants weighing <120kg following bimekizumab 160mg Q4W continuous dosing (Figure 30).

Exposure-safety analysis of bimekizumab 
The exposure-response relationships for safety include data from only Phase 3 studies, PA0010, PA0011, 
and PA0012. These studies represent the majority of study participants who were treated with 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W continuous dosing. 
Infections were used in the exposure-response analysis since the incidence was high enough to result in a 
meaningful number of cases for comparison between the different plasma concentration quartiles. In 
addition, given the mechanism of action of bimekizumab, it is mechanistically considered possible to have 
an exposure-response relationship for infections. 
Plasma bimekizumab trough concentrations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in 
incidences of TEAEs or incidences of infection TEAEs. The incidences of TEAEs in the first, second, third, 
and fourth concentration quartiles were 77.1%, 72.3%, 79.7%, and 81.0%, respectively, and the 
incidences of infection TEAEs were 50.3%, 42.6%, 54.4%, and 56.9%, respectively (Table 27). Likewise, 
no clear pattern was observed for the incidences of TEAEs in the first, second, third, and fourth 
concentration quartiles for the high-level group term of Fungal infectious disorders (8.3%, 12.9%, 
19.0%, and 11.8%, respectively) or the high level term of Candida infection (4.5%, 6.5%, 12.0%, and 
7.8%, respectively). 
Thus, no clear trend was observed between bimekizumab exposure following 160mg Q4W in study 
participants with PsA and the incidences of overall TEAEs, infection TEAEs, Fungal infectious disorder 
TEAEs, or Candida infection TEAEs. None of the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT (defined as ≥5% of 
study participants in any plasma concentration quartile) showed a meaningful increase in incidence with 
increasing bimekizumab trough plasma concentration quartile (Table 27).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The PK method used a standard ligand binding approach based on the meso scale discovery (MSD) 
platform. Four PK assays were used, three of which were previously assessed in the initial MAA for 
psoriasis and therefore are considered to be appropriately validated. The new PK method (PK Method 
#4), which was not included in the initial MAA, has been appropriately validated in accordance with ICH 
M10. Method performance data from the clinical studies were provided in the bioanalytical reports, and in 
general showed that the methods performed as expected.  
The ADA method used a standard ligand binding MSD platform approach where samples and positive and 
negative controls were incubated with Biotin-UCB4940, Sulfo-Tag-UCB4940, anti-human IL-17A, and 
rabbit anti-human IL-17F. Any ADA present in the human plasma will form a bridge between the Biotin-
UCB4940 and Sulfo-Tag-UCB4940 molecules, with the anti-human IL-17A and anti-human IL-17F. Five 
versions of the ADA assay were used throughout development, all of which were previously assessed in 
the original MAA for the psoriasis indication. Bioanalytical reports from all relevant trials have been 
provided and showed that the assay passed routine control testing and performed as expected.  
Competitive ligand binding assay methods were used to detect neutralising antibodies. The methods were 
assessed as part of the initial MAA submission for the PSO indication. Bioanalytical study reports were 
provided for each study and showed acceptable assay performance.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 70/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Additional validation data were submitted due to questionable performance of the NAb assays during 
sample analysis from plaque psoriasis patients and showed acceptable assay performance. Assay 
performance in patients with PsAwere appropriately described.  
Device use study 
The design and methodology of the device use study (DV0004) are acceptable. Exclusion of participants 
from each study arm was adequately detailed and per protocol. Self-injection was investigated into the 
thigh or abdomen. The MAH considered that self-administration into the upper arm was not convenient 
(especially for patients with limited hand dexterity) and thus was not evaluated in DV0004. This is 
acknowledged. 
Overall, the results of the device presentation substudy demonstrated that there were no clinically 
meaningful differences observed in bimekizumab plasma trough concentrations between investigational 
device presentations (bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL), and injection by study personnel 
or self-injection.  
Although the participant numbers were lower in study participants who chose to self-inject in the thigh 
compared with the abdomen, the bimekizumab trough concentrations were similar.  
As expected, plasma trough concentrations were inversely related to BMI. This is in-line with the 
population PK analyses where body weight was a significant covariate on CL/F and V/F, explaining the 
decrease in plasma concentration with an increase in weight. See Special Populations section for further 
discussion of the impact of body weight on bimekizumab exposure. Within each BMI tertile, plasma 
concentrations were generally similar irrespective of whether the previous dose had been administered by 
the study participant or study personnel.  
Of note, in the pivotal Phase 3 studies (AS0010 and AS0011), dose administration in the lateral 
abdominal wall, upper arm and upper outer thigh by study staff was permitted. It was recommended to 
rotate between different injection sites during the study. 
PK in the target population 
Phase 2  
The results of PA0008 indicated dose-proportional PK of bimekizumab between the dose ranges studied 
(16mg, 160mg and 320mg), which is consistent with other PK studies of bimekizumab in different 
populations. Steady state was reached between weeks 16-20, which is consistent with bimekizumab half-
life of 23 days. 
The results of PA0009 showed that participants who had received 160mg Q4W in PA0008 remained at 
steady state throughout the study. As expected, participants who received 320mg Q4W in PA0008 
showed almost double plasma concentrations compared with the 160mg Q4W group at PA0009 EV. 
Plasma bimekizumab concentrations for study participants who received bimekizumab 320mg Q4W in 
PA0008 decreased at Week 12 of PA0009, and reached similar levels to the bimekizumab 160mg group 
from PA0008 from Week 24 onwards, indicating that steady state levels had been achieved. 
Phase 3  
The study designs and methodologies of PA0010 and PA0011 studies in adults with active PsA were 
appropriate. The pharmacokinetic sampling schemes in these studies were adequate; PK samples were 
collected prior to dosing. PK samples were also collected at safety follow-up visits.  
The PK results of PA0010 and PA0011 indicated that mean plasma bimekizumab concentrations increased 
with repeat dosing, reaching steady state concentrations by Week 16, which is in-line with the other 
studies in this application. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 71/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Bimekizumab plasma concentrations observed in Japanese study participants were generally comparable 
with those observed in the overall study population following bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W. However, the 
small number of Japanese study participants included limits conclusions.  
Overall, final PK data from the phase 2 PsA studies, PA0008 and PA0009, and from the phase 3 PsA study 
PA0011 were provided and summarised with descriptive statistics. Summarised PK data up to Week 24 
were also provided by the MAH for the study PA0010 in this submission.  
For study PA0012, no individual CSR presenting the PK data was provided. The POPPK report CL0538 is 
describing that blood PK samples are collected at entry visit (i.e. Week 52 of PA0010 or Week 16 of 
PA0011), at weeks 4, 12, 24, 52, 72, 96, 120, 140, and at the end of the SFU period. All samples are 
pre-dose trough samples. Available data from study PA0012 at the time of the PA0011 data cut are 
included in the integrated popPK analysis. The interim bioanalytical reports for the study PA0012 were 
provided. 
Upon CHMP’s request, final PK data have been submitted for study PA0010. The study PA0012 is still 
ongoing. The MAH has committed to submit the final data and CSR in September 2026. It is expected 
that the consistency with the current PK conclusions will be verified at that time. 
In study PA0010, the results by week 52 confirmed that steady state was reached by week 16 and 
maintained up to Week 52. The BKZ plasma concentrations by week 52 were consistent to those 
observed by week 16 and week 24 (see initial assessment before) in Japanese patients (from final CSR 
PA0010). 
Population PK modelling 
In the integrated popPK analysis, the methods used for model development and evaluation are 
considered acceptable. Data exclusions were well detailed and acceptable. 
The starting model for this analysis was based on the previous popPK model for bimekizumab in patients 
with PSO. The key findings from this popPK analysis in patients with PSO, PsA, or axSpA were consistent 
with those made from the previous popPK analysis of PSO data only. 
The final model, a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, adequately 
described the data. The choice of a one-compartment rather than a two-compartment structural model 
was adequately justified by the MAH. Among the tested covariates, only bodyweight on CL/F and V/F and 
race on CL/F were retained in the final model. Bodyweight had the largest impact on CL/F and impacted 
V/F to a lesser extent, with higher body weight being associated with reduced bimekizumab exposure. 
Japanese patients were predicted to have 23% higher CL/F, and Chinese and other Asian patients were 
predicted to have 13% higher CL/F, compared to the reference Caucasian population. See Special 
populations for further details. 
All PK parameters (fixed and random effects) in the final model were estimated with good precision 
(RSE<22.5%). The IIV terms were associated with reasonable shrinkage values: 22%, 34% and 15% for 
CL/F, V/F and Frel, respectively. The GOF plots showed that the model described the observed data well. 
The pcVPCs showed that the model captured the global trend and the variability of the concentration vs 
time data reasonably well. Overall, the final model is deemed adequate for deriving individual PK 
parameters (EBEs) and PK exposure metrics to be used in the subsequent PK/PD modelling analyses. 
Dosing simulations based on the final popPK model predicted a lower median Ctrough,ss (6.34 µg/mL) 
with a dose regimen of 320 mg Q8W compared with a median Ctrough,ss (10.7 µg/mL) with a dose 
regimen of 160 mg Q4W. Given that the proposed maintenance dose of bimekizumab in patients with PsA 
and concomitant moderate to severe PSO is 320 mg Q8W, as opposed to 160 mg Q4W in patients with 
PsA, the MAH has revised the recommended posology of bimekizumab in such patients. An option for 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 72/234 
 
 
 
 
  
dosing patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at 160 mg Q4W after 
Week 16, based on clinical response in the joints, has now been included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. This 
is agreed.  
Immunogenicity 
Bimekizumab plasma concentrations were lower in ADAb-positive and NAb-positive study participants in 
the pooled Phase 3 PsA studies at Week 16. The impact of ADAb and NAb positivity on bimekizumab 
plasma concentrations beyond Week 24 based on available data from PA0010 was consistent with the 
impact observed in the pooled data up to Week 16. However, ADAb status, ADAb titers, and NAb status 
were not identified as clinically relevant covariates in the population PK analysis. Based on the final popPK 
model, steady-state bimekizumab exposures were predicted to be similar in ADAb+/NAb+ patients 
compared to ADAb- and ADAb+/NAb-patients.  
Key efficacy endpoints (ACR20 and ACR50) showed numerically lower response rates in ADAb-positive 
and NAb-positive study participants compared with ADAb-negative participants in the pooled Phase 3 PsA 
studies at Week 16. However, no clinically meaningful impact of ADAb or NAb status on efficacy was 
observed at Week 24 based on the available data from PA0010. Further, ADAb and NAb status were not 
identified as statistically significant covariates in the population exposure-response (ACR) PK/PD analysis. 
In addition, ADAb or NAb positivity had no clinically meaningful impact on the safety profile of 
bimekizumab, including no increase in hypersensitivity TEAEs. Overall, the impact of ADAb and NAb 
positivity on efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in patients with PsA does is not considered to be clinically 
meaningful by the CHMP.  
Upon CHMP’s request, individual study and pooled data up to week 52 were provided for further analysis 
of immunogenicity data. The results indicated that the plasma concentration levels of bimekizumab were 
reduced in study participants who were ADAb positive and NAb positive compared with those who were 
ADAb negative. However, ADAb and NAb had no impact on the clinical efficacy (ACR20 and ACR50 
response rates) up to Week 52 or the safety (TEAE incidence including injection site reactions or 
hypersensitivity reactions) of study participants treated with bimekizumab. No events were reported for 
anaphylactic reactions in the Phase 3 studies in PsA. Further, results from the population PK analyses 
using data to approximately 1 year across indications confirmed no clinically meaningful impact for ADAb 
or NAb positivity on bimekizumab PK. Finally, based on the population PK/PD modeling of ACR response 
in patients with PsA, ADAb and NAb status were not identified as statistically significant covariates on 
either the probability of ACR response or maximum effect for dose/bimekizumab concentration effect. 
Data on ADA and Nab status by week 52 from study PA0010 as well as pooled data on ADA- and NAb 
status by Week 16 were reflected in the section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
Special populations 
A dose adjustment in terms of renal/hepatic impairment, age and sex is not considered warranted. 
Race 
The impact of race on bimekizumab exposure was less pronounced than that of body weight. Simulations 
suggested that bimekizumab exposure following 160mg Q4W was comparable in Japanese, Chinese/other 
Asian, and Caucasian participants since the effect of faster clearance on exposure was offset by the 
smaller median body weight in Japanese and Chinese/other Asian participants compared with Caucasian 
participants. Therefore, a dose adjustment of bimekizumab in terms of race is not considered warranted. 
The section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that no clinically meaningful differences in 
bimekizumab exposure were observed in Chinese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 73/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Body weight 
In the popPK analysis, body weight had a significant impact on bimekizumab exposure following 160 mg 
Q4W. However, in the PK/PD model of ACR response (the primary efficacy endpoint in study participants 
with PsA), an increase of 20% in bimekizumab CL/F led to a decrease of only 1.4% in the median 
predicted probability of achieving ACR50 at Week 16 following 160mg Q4W. Simulations from the ACR 
PK/PD model showed that drops larger than 20% in exposure with increasing body weight were predicted 
to have minimal impact on ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response rates. Additionally, bimekizumab exposure 
following 160mg Q4W at the higher end of the exposure range in study participants with PsA did not 
appear to be associated with increased incidences of overall TEAEs and infection TEAEs. Therefore, a dose 
adjustment of bimekizumab in patients with PsA, without concomitant moderate to severe PSO, is not 
considered warranted in terms of body weight including overweight patients (≥120 kg). 
In contrast, the PK/PD model of PASI response indicated that body weight had the largest impact on PASI 
response rates. This can be explained by body weight impact on both PK (bimekizumab exposure) and PD 
(PASI t1/2). Simulations based on the PK/PD model showed a ~12% difference in Week 48 PASI90 
response rate for study participants weighing ≥120kg compared with <120kg, while a smaller difference 
(~8%) was predicted between study participants weighing ≥100kg compared with <100kg. As such, the 
MAH considers that an increased dose or dosing frequency may be of benefit in patients with PsA and 
concomitant moderate to severe PSO weighing ≥120kg. This is agreed and is consistent with the 
approved dosing recommendation for patients with PSO. The section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated 
accordingly.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
The PD biomarkers evaluated in PA0008 were appropriate given the mechanism of action of 
bimekizumab. However, the results did not show any clinically relevant impact of bimekizumab on these 
biomarkers. 
No biomarker assessments were conducted in studies PA0009, PA0010, or PA0011. However, clinical 
response in terms of PASI and ACR was evaluated. See PK/PD modelling for further details.  
PK/PD modelling 
Phase 2  
The Phase 2 PK/PD analyses were conducted to select the dose regimen/s to be tested in the pivotal 
Phase 3 studies. Whilst it could be argued that the 320 mg Q4W regimen may have been appropriate to 
test in patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe PSO, in addition to the selected 160 mg 
Q4W, this was not the case. The MAH’s justification for the selected dose regimen for the pivotal Phase 3 
studies can be followed. 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 
The developed population PK-PD models described the ER relationships between bimekizumab 
concentrations and the two efficacy endpoints (PASI and ACR). Covariates were identified and their 
impact on the PASI or ACR response was evaluated. The results were used to inform the rationale for the 
proposed dose regimens in patients with PsA, and patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe 
PSO.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 74/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
ACR model 
The final PK/PD model provided an adequate description of the ER relationship between bimekizumab 
concentrations and ACR response. VPCs showed that the predictive performance of the model was 
reasonable overall.  
The following covariates were included in the final model: age and baseline hs-CRP on Emax, as well as 
sex on the probability of response. Under active treatment, the probability of ACR response increased 
with decreasing age, and with increasing baseline hs-CRP. Males had higher probability of ACR response 
than females. However, the impact of these covariates on ACR response were not considered to be driven 
by PK changes. There was no evidence of a statistically significant impact for ADAb/NAb status, use of 
concomitant medications at baseline or disease duration on either probability of ACR response or Emax. 
The dose-response relationship was shown to be steep with the ACR response but appeared to plateau by 
160 mg Q4W. This supports the proposed bimekizumab dose of 160 mg Q4W for PsA patients without 
concomitant moderate to severe PSO. 
PASI model 
The final PK/PD model for PASI provided an adequate description of the data. VPCs showed that the 
model predicted the median and the variability in PASI75 and PASI90 response rates reasonably well.  
The following covariates were included in the final model: prior biologics use and study (PA0008) on 
baseline PASI and body weight on PASI t1/2. Patients with prior biologics use had an estimated 16% 
higher baseline PASI score compared with biologic naive patients, and there did not appear to be a large 
difference in either the PASI75 or PASI90 response rates at Week 48, between the two sub-populations. 
Higher body weight was predictive of longer PASI t1/2. Compared with a typical subject with PsA (median 
WT is 85.5 kg), the PASI t1/2 was predicted to increase by 22% and 53% for a patient weighing 100 kg 
and 120 kg, respectively. Body weight also impacted bimekizumab exposure, and exposure was found to 
decrease with increasing body weight. See Special Populations for further discussion of the impact of 
body weight on bimekizumab PK and PASI response. 
Additional simulations evaluated the Week 16 PASI75 and PASI90 response rates with placebo, 16, 80, 
160 and 320 mg Q4W dose regimens. The PASI90 response rates were predicted to increase with 
increasing doses to 320 mg Q4W. Doses lower than 160 mg Q4W were predicted to result in lower 
PASI75 and PASI90 response rates. Compared to 160 mg Q4W, the simulations showed more prominent 
effect for the higher dose regimen of 320 mg Q4W on Week 16 PASI90 than PASI75 response rates. The 
predicted Week 16 median PASI90 response rates were 66% and 78% with 160 and 320 mg Q4W, 
respectively. The time course of PASI90 response rate also demonstrated faster onset of response after 
treatment initiation with 320 mg Q4W compared with 160 mg Q4W. These results provide support for the 
proposed dose of 320 mg Q4W for treatment initiation in patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to 
severe PSO (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Exposure-safety analysis 
Bimekizumab plasma trough concentrations following 160 mg Q4W in Phase 3 studies were not 
associated with clinically-relevant increases in incidences of TEAEs or infection. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The bimekizumab pharmacokinetics in adult patients with PsA has been adequately characterised and the 
PK properties were similar in patients with plaque psoriasis and axSpA. Section 5.2 of the SmPC was 
updated accordingly. The selected dose regimen of 160 mg Q4W for patients with PsA in the Phase 3 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 75/234 
 
 
 
 
  
studies is considered appropriate. The proposed dose adjustment in patients with PsA and concomitant 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is also supported. Section 4.5 of the SmPC is updated to indicate 
that PK analyses have shown that drug clearance of bimekizumab was not impacted by concomitant 
administration of cDMARDs including methotrexate or by prior exposure to biologics. 
2.4.   Clinical efficacy 
In support of this extension to the indication, the following data has been submitted: 
•  PA0010: Placebo-controlled study with adalimumab reference arm BE OPTIMAL. (DMARD naïve) 
o  Week 24 data cut. Approximately 75% of study participants in this study reached Week 
52 at the time of the 24-week data cut-off. 
o  Upon CHMP’s request: complete efficacy 52-week study data was provided.  
•  PA0011: Completed Phase 3 placebo-controlled study. BE COMPLETE. (DMARD iR and intolerant)  
o  Week 16 data cut 
•  PA0007: Completed Phase 1 study 
•  PA0008: Completed Phase 2 study and PA0009, its OLE study 
•  PA0012: Open-label extension study for eligible PA0010 and PA0011 completers, ongoing, 
proposed as part of pharmacovigilance plan for PsA program (see RMP section below) 
•  DV0004: Completed Phase 3 device sub-study within the OLE study PA0012 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
The recommended dose and dosing regimen tested in the Phase 3 studies of bimekizumab was selected 
based on safety, efficacy, and PK data from the Phase 2b dose response study PA0008 in adult patients 
with PsA, as well as PK/PD modelling in that study (CL0464) and was as follows: 
• 
For adult patients with PsA, the recommended dose of bimekizumab is 160mg Q4W.  
While a loading dose was initially considered for faster onset of action, it was determined that higher 
exposures associated with the initial loading dose could result in treatment effects at an early timepoint 
that were not reflective of long-term efficacy of a chronic therapy. The loading dose could artificially 
inflate the response seen at Week 16 or at Week 24, which would not be reflective of maintenance 
response in a chronic disease.  
PA0008 Phase 2b 
A Phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-ranging study 
to investigate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of bimekizumab compared with placebo in adult study 
participants with active PsA. PA0008 study results were used to guide the selection of doses and clinical 
indices in the Phase 3 development.  
Adult patients with a documented diagnosis of adult onset PsA with active psoriatic lesions and/or a 
documented history of psoriasis, negative for RF and for anti-CPP antibodies, were recruited. Patients 
were anti-TNF naïve or have received 1 prior TNF inhibitor (max 30% of patients). Stable and defined 
doses of NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, MTX or LEF were allowed. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 76/234 
 
 
 
 
  
In the 12-week DB treatment period, 5 dosing regimens were investigated. After week 12, patients in the 
16 mg Q4W arm were re-randomised to 160 mg or 320 mg Q4W. Patients in the other treatment arms 
remained on their assigned treatment for the 36-week dose blind period. 
Eligible study participants were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, bimekizumab 16mg 
Q4W, bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, bimekizumab 160mg Q4W with a 320mg loading dose at Baseline, and 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W.  
Figure 31: Schematic diagram for PA0008 
Study participants in any treatment group who completed the 12-week Double-Blind Period entered the 
36- week Dose Blind Period.  
At the Week 12 Visit, study participants were allocated to the bimekizumab treatment regimens as 
follows:  
• 
• 
• 
study participants in the placebo group and the bimekizumab 16mg group were re-randomised 
1:1 to bimekizumab 160mg or bimekizumab 320mg Q4W;  
study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg and bimekizumab 160mg w/LD groups continued to 
receive bimekizumab 160mg Q4W;  
and study participants in the bimekizumab 320mg group continued to receive bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W.  
After the completion of the Dose-Blind Period, all study participants not continuing in the extension study 
(PA0009), or those withdrawn from IMP, were to have an SFU Visit 20 weeks after their last dose of IMP.  
The main efficacy analyses were performed at week 12 through ACR and PASI scoring. PK, PD, 
immunological and safety assessments were performed as specified. Subgroup analysis included a.o. 
BASDAI score, prior anti-TNF exposure, anti-drug Ab development and extent of psoriasis. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally well balanced across treatment groups. Treatment groups 
were generally well balanced with respect to PsA-related and other Baseline disease characteristics. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 77/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Prior anti-TNF therapy had been used by 18.9% of all study participants. At Baseline, the majority of 
study participants were using 1 NSAID therapy (62.1%) and/or sDMARDs (67.0%, primarily MTX 
(63.6%). Mean and median TJC scores were higher in the bimekizumab 320mg group compared with the 
other treatment groups. The majority of study participants had ≥3% PSO BSA at Baseline (66.5%). A 
substantial proportion of study participants at Baseline also had nail PSO (75.2%), dactylitis (28.6%), 
and/or enthesitis (51.9%), with some variability across groups; in particular, a lower proportion of study 
participants had dactylitis at Baseline in the bimekizumab 16mg group (12.2%) compared with the other 
treatment groups (range: 26.8% to 39.0%). 
Overall, 5 study participants in each of the FAS and DBS (2.4% and 2.5%, respectively) used a rescue 
medication during the study; the incidence of rescue medication was similar across treatment groups. The 
reported rescue medications were sulfasalazine (3 study participants), apremilast (1 study participant), 
and MTX and celecoxib (both used by the same 1 study participant at different times). 
PA0008 Results  
In PA0008, both ACR50 and Reduction of 90% from Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI90) responder rates saturated at bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, and a further increase in dose did not 
provide a significant benefit on either ACR50 or PASI90 responder rates. An exposure-response analysis 
performed on both endpoints also indicated that bimekizumab 160mg Q4W was the optimal dose for 
these study participants. 
Double-blind period 
A total of 206 study participants were randomised and started the study as follows: 42 study participants 
in the placebo group and 41 study participants each in the bimekizumab 16mg, 160mg, 160mg w/LD, 
and 320mg groups. Overall, 203 of 206 study participants (98.5%) completed the Double-Blind Period. 
The primary reason for study discontinuation given by the 3 study participants (1.5%) who discontinued 
the study during the Double-blind Period was AE by 2 study participants (1.0%) and “other” by 1 study 
participant (0.5%). 
Overall, 189 of 206 study participants (91.7%) completed the study; the percentages of study 
participants who completed the study were high and similar across all bimekizumab groups and the 
placebo group (range across groups: 82.9% to 97.6%).  
Dose-blind period 
A total of 199 study participants started the Dose-Blind Period. Of the 199 study participants (100%) who 
started the Dose-blind Period, 186 study participants (93.5%) completed IMP treatment and 9 study 
participants (4.5%) discontinued IMP treatment; no study participants discontinued IMP treatment for 
reasons of intolerance or lack of efficacy; 4 study participants had their Visit 15 injections interrupted due 
to AEs, therefore these study participants were not presented as having completed nor as having 
discontinued IMP; all 4 study participants completed the study.  
There were 184 study participants who completed the study and enrolled into the extension study, 
PA0009.  
Primary analysis of the primary efficacy variable- Across the bimekizumab doses included in the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test, a statistically significant dose response was observed in ACR50 responder rates at 
Week 12 (p=0.031; Table 28). This dose response was linear at bimekizumab doses up to 160mg, with 
ACR50 responder rates at Week 12 ranging from 26.8% (bimekizumab 16mg) to 41.5% (bimekizumab 
160mg). The ACR50 responder rate at Week 12 in the placebo group was 7.1%.

(FAS[NRI]) (PA0008) 
Secondary, supportive, and sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable - demonstrated 
significantly better ACR50 responder rates at Week 12 for the bimekizumab 16mg, 160mg, and 160mg 
w/LD doses vs placebo; the comparison for the bimekizumab 320mg dose vs placebo was not statistically 
significant, although the difference was clinically relevant. All supportive and sensitivity analyses were 
consistent with the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. Improvement in the individual components 
of the ACR was consistent with the secondary analysis of the primary efficacy variable. 
Secondary efficacy variables- The results of all 4 secondary endpoints are consistent and support the 
findings of the primary endpoint.  
•  ACR20 response at Week 12- Clinically relevant differences were observed in the pairwise 
comparison of ACR20 response at Week 12 for the bimekizumab 16mg (53.7%), 160mg (73.2%), 
160mg w/LD (61.0%), and 320mg (51.2%) groups compared with the placebo group (19.0%; 
p≤0.004 for each comparison). 
•  ACR70 response at Week 12- A greater percentage of ACR70 responders at Week 12 was 
observed in the bimekizumab 16mg (12.2%), 160mg (19.5%), 160mg w/LD (31.7%), and 
320mg (14.6%) groups compared with the placebo group (4.8%); the comparison to placebo was 
significant for the bimekizumab 160mg w/LD group only (p=0.006). 
• 
• 
PASI75 response at Week 12- Clinically relevant differences were observed in the pairwise 
comparison of PASI75 response at Week 12 for the bimekizumab 16mg (44.8%), 160mg 
(64.3%), 160mg w/LD (76.9%), and 320mg (73.1%) groups compared with the placebo group 
(7.1%; p≤0.005 for each comparison) (Table 29). 
PASI90 response at Week 12- A greater percentage of PASI90 responders at Week 12 was 
observed in the bimekizumab 16mg (20.7%), 160mg (46.4%), 160mg w/LD (53.8%), and 
320mg (53.8%) groups compared with the placebo group (7.1%); the comparison to the placebo 
group was significant for the 3 highest bimekizumab dose groups (p≤0.002; Table 29).

regression analysis (FAS [NRI]) (PA0008) 
Other efficacy endpoints: 
In general, improvements were observed in all bimekizumab treatment groups for all other efficacy 
variables (except for SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS) scores), which were maintained through Week 48, and these results support the 
conclusions of the primary analysis.  
Simulations were performed using the PK/PD model to predict the dose response of Week 12 ACR20, 
ACR50, and ACR70 response rates. Based on the simulations, the maximum ACR response rate was 
predicted to be achieved with the 160mg Q4W dose. Higher doses, such as 320mg, were unlikely to 
provide additional benefit. Simulations from the model indicated that PASI75 and PASI90 response rates 
were near maximal at 160mg Q4W for the overall PsA population (with mostly mild to moderate skin 
disease). The simulations also indicated that doses lower than 160mg may provide reduced PASI75 and 
PASI90 responses. While some improvement in Week 12 PASI90 was predicted with the 320mg Q4W 
regimen, the limited number of participants with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe PSO in study 
PA0008 precluded robust assessment of PASI responses for this subgroup. Thus, the Phase 3 PsA 
programme utilized bimekizumab 160mg Q4W for all participants, including participants with concomitant 
moderate to severe PSO. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Title of Studies PA0010 and PA0011 
The bimekizumab PsA clinical development program consisted of 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies. PA0010 and 
PA0011 are randomised, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with active PsA through 52 weeks and 
16 weeks, respectively. PA0010 also included an active reference arm (adalimumab). 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 80/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
PA0010 (BE OPTIMAL)  
A Phase 3, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferential active reference 
(adalimumab) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in study participants with active 
PsA who are bDMARD-naïve. 
PA0011 (BE COMPLETE), 
A Phase 3, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab in study participants with active PsA with inadequate response (lack of efficacy 
after at least 3 months of therapy at an approved dose) or intolerance to treatment with 1 or 2 TNFα 
inhibitors for either PsA or PSO (TNFα-IR). 
Methods 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design was selected to demonstrate efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab in both studies PA0010 and PA0011.  
Both studies were placebo-controlled during the 16-week double-blind periods (Initial Treatment Period). 
PA0010 also included an active reference arm (adalimumab), and the study duration extended beyond 
the Initial Treatment Period to allow for collection of long-term safety and efficacy data through 52 weeks 
of treatment. An interim analysis was performed for PA0010 at Week 24 and for PA0011 at Week 16, 
which included the Week 16 primary analysis time point in each study. 
At the time of the Week 24 data cut-off in PA0010, the 36-week Active Treatment Blind Period was 
ongoing; however, 75% of study participants in PA0010 had reached Week 52. 
After completion of the treatment period of PA0010 or PA0011, eligible study participants were allowed to 
enrol in an OLE study, PA0012, where ongoing data on the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
bimekizumab in this population will be collected for up to 160 weeks. Study participants who did not enrol 
into PA0012 entered a 20-week Safety Follow-Up (SFU) Period in PA0010 or PA0011. 
PA0010  
The overall study design consists of a Screening Period (≥14 days to ≤35 days), a 16-week placebo 
controlled Double Blind Treatment Period, a 36-week Active Treatment-Blind Period (through Week 52 
and including the adalimumab treatment arm), and a SFU Visit 20 weeks after the final dose of 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) (for participants not entering the OLE study or who discontinue 
early, including those withdrawn from IMP). Efficacy data from the completed PA0010 study (up to Week 
52) was provided upon CHMP’s request.  
EMA/235043/2023

Study participants were randomised 3:2:1 (stratified by region and bone erosion [0, ≥1]) to receive 1 of 
3 blinded treatments (bimekizumab 160mg subcutaneous [sc] Q4W, placebo, or active-reference 
[adalimumab 40mg sc every 2 weeks]) and remained on their allowable background medication. 
Figure 32: Schematic diagram for PA0010 
After 16 weeks of double-blind treatment (Double Blind Treatment Period), study participants entered the 
Active Treatment-Blind Period. All study participants randomised to placebo were reallocated to receive 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. Study participants randomised to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W continued to 
receive their originally randomised dose. Study participants randomised to active-reference (adalimumab) 
continued with their active treatment. After Week 16, if the study participants were not responding 
adequately as per Investigators’ judgement, rescue therapy was allowed. 
PA0011 
The overall study design consisted of a Screening Period (≥14 days to ≤35 days), a 16-week placebo 
controlled Double Blind Treatment Period, and a SFU Visit, 20 weeks after the final dose of IMP (for 
participants not entering the OLE study or who discontinued early, including those withdrawn from IMP). 
Participants completing Week 16 were eligible for enrollment in an OLE study to continue to receive 
bimekizumab. The PA0011 study is complete. 
Study participants who completed Week 16 and were eligible for enrollment in the open-label extension 
(OLE) study, PA0012, continued to receive bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W. Study participants who did not 
enter PA0012 after completing the IMP treatment period entered a 20-week SFU Period.  
The maximum study duration per study participant was up to 37 weeks.

region and bone erosion [0, ≥1]) to the following treatment groups:  
•  bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W (420 study participants),  
•  placebo (280 study participants), and  
•  adalimumab sc 40mg every 2 weeks (140 study participants). 
A total of 852 study participants were randomised and started the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
PA0011 
Approximately 390 study participants were planned to be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the 
following treatment groups: 
•  260 study participants bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W and  
•  130 study participants placebo 
A total of 400 study participants were randomised and started the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
Interim analysis 
PA0010 
The interim analysis initially submitted by the MAH was done following the last scheduled Week 24 visit; 
this Week 24 interim analysis forms the basis of the Week 24 clinical study report (CSR). It included all 
efficacy data up to Week 24 and all available safety data up to the data cut of the Week 24 interim 
analysis (25 October 2021), which included additional safety data for any study participant who was 
ongoing in this 52 week study or in the SFU Period at the time of the Week 24 data cut. At the time of the 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 83/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Week 24 data cut-off in PA0010, the 36-week Active Treatment Blind Period was ongoing; however, 75% 
of study participants in PA0010 had reached Week 52. Upon CHMP’s request, the final CSR (with data up 
to week 52) was also submitted by the MAH.  
PA0011 
The Week 16 interim analysis was done following the last scheduled Week 16 visit. It included all efficacy 
data up to the Week 16 primary analysis time point and all available safety data up to Week 16, which 
included additional safety data for any study participants who were in or who completed the SFU Period at 
the time of the data cut of the Week 16 interim analysis (22 December 2021). Only 3 study participants 
were in the SFU Period at the time of the Week 16 interim analysis database lock; all other study 
participants had completed the study or the SFU Period. All data, including the SFU data, were included in 
the final PA0011 CSR. The PA0011 final CSR database lock (04 March 2022) was performed after the SFU 
Period was complete.

Treatments 
The PsA Phase 3 clinical studies evaluated a dose regimen of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W.  
In these studies, bimekizumab was supplied in a 1mL prefilled syringe (PFS) at a nominal formulation of 
160mg/mL (55mM sodium acetate, 220mM glycine, 0.04% polysorbate 80 at pH 5.0) for subcutaneous 
(sc) injection. All Phase 3 studies used the bimekizumab-True North (TN) device presentation. 
PA0010 
Adalimumab: commercially available and was supplied as a PFS for sc injection (at a concentration of 
40mg/0.8mL or 40mg/0.4mL depending on regional availability) in a single-use syringe. 
Placebo: 0.9% sodium chloride aqueous solution (physiological saline, preservative free) of 
pharmacopoeia (USP/Ph.Eur) quality in a 1mL PFS for sc injection. 
PA0011 
Placebo: 0.9% sodium chloride aqueous solution (physiological saline, preservative-free) of 
pharmacopoeia (US Pharmacopoeia/European Pharmacopoeia) quality in a 1mL PFS for sc injection. 
Background Treatments PA0010 and PA0011 
•  No medication increases or additions were permitted for medications taken for PsA at baseline 
until Week 16. However, a decrease in dose or dosing frequency of any agent was permitted for 
reasons of intolerance/AEs/side-effects at any time. 
•  Study participants were allowed to use acetaminophen/paracetamol and mild opioids as needed, 
except within 24 hours of a visit with disease activity assessment. 
•  Study participants who were already receiving an established antidepressant regimen were on a 
stable dose of the antidepressant for 8 weeks prior to Baseline. 
• 
For treatment of PSO, study participants could continue to use topical moisturizers, emollients, 
salicylic acid preparations, bath oils, oatmeal bath preparations, over-the-counter shampoos, mild 
topical steroids were permitted for use limited to the face, axillae, and/or genitalia, as needed. 
•  Use of psoralen and ultraviolet A light therapy for the treatment of PSO was not permitted for the 
first 16 weeks of both studies and was discouraged through the remainder of duration of the 
PA0010 study. 
•  Administration of live (including attenuated) vaccines was not allowed during the conduct of the 
study and for 20 weeks after the final dose IMP.

PA0010 
•  After the Week 16 Visit, the addition of topical retinoids, vitamin D analogues, coal tar 
preparations, and more potent topical steroids could be used as medically required to treat a flare 
but were not permitted to be used within 24 hours prior to a study visit.  
Rescue Treatments 
PA0010 
After the 16-week Double-Blind Treatment Period, if the study participants were not responding 
adequately as per Investigators’ judgement, rescue therapy was allowed. 
Study participants who were rescued remained on IMP. Permitted rescue therapy for eligible study 
participants was at the Investigator’s discretion, with the following options: 
•  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cDMARDs (MTX, SSZ, LEF, HCQ, apremilast), and/or joint 
injections may be given as permitted rescue therapy if deemed appropriate by the Investigator as 
outlined below. Study participants may have received these add-on therapies while continuing to 
receive their randomized dose of IMP. 
•  A decrease in dose or dosing frequency of any agent for the treatment of PsA was permitted for 
reasons of intolerance/AEs/side-effects at any time. 
PA0011 
Rescue medication was not permitted in the 16-week Double-Blind Treatment Period.

Baseline 
•  Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) score categories 
•  Change from Baseline in DAPSA score 
•  Change from Baseline in the Disease Activity Score-28 based on C-reactive protein

(DAS28[CRP]) 
•  Change from Baseline in all individual ACR core components: SJC, TJC, HAQ-DI, PtAAP,

Arthritis (PGA-PsA), and hs-CRP 
Sample size 
PA0010: 
For power calculations of the primary endpoint, the sample size assumptions for bimekizumab versus 
placebo were based on the ACR50 response data from the Phase 2b bimekizumab study in study 
participants with moderate-to-severe PsA (PA0008). The median ACR50 responses of the top 3 dose 
groups (bimekizumab 160mg, 320mg, and 320mg [initial dose] plus 160mg) at Week 12 in the TNF-naïve 
population are conservatively assumed for the Week 16 endpoint. The observed median ACR50 response 
rate of the top 3 bimekizumab doses in the TNF-naïve population in study PA0008 was 43.8%. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 89/234 
 
 
 
 
  
The placebo ACR50 response at Week 16 is based on the TNFα-naïve population in PA0008 (6.1% at 
Week 12, study participants with available measurement (n)=33); Mease et al, 2015), FUTURE 2 study in 
the subgroup of TNFα-naïve study participants (15.9%, n=63; McInnes et al, 2014), FUTURE 3 study 
(11.8%, n=93; Nash et al, 2018), and FUTURE 5 study in a mixed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) 
exposure population (8.1% at Week 16, n=332; Mease et al, 2018). Therefore, the estimated ACR50 
response at Week 16 in the placebo group is assumed to be 16%. 
The sample size for showing statistical superiority of bimekizumab vs placebo was calculated using a 2-
sided 2-sample Chi-square test with continuity correction (Fleiss et al, 1980). Assuming 420 study 
participants in the bimekizumab group and 280 study participants in the placebo group, the test for 
detecting statistical superiority of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W vs placebo based on ACR50 response at 
Week 16 has >99% power to detect a true treatment difference of 27.8% (OR=4.09). 
The assumptions for power calculations of the secondary endpoints included in the hierarchy, and for 
which supporting data exists, are based on the interim results of the Phase 2b bimekizumab study 
PA0008 and the FUTURE 1, FUTURE 2, FUTURE 5, and SPIRIT P1 studies. All power calculations for binary 
endpoints were performed using a 2-sided 2-sample Chi-square test with continuity correction (Fleiss et 
al, 1980). All power calculations for continuous endpoints were performed using a 2-sided 2-group 
Satterthwaite t-test (Moser et al, 1989). 
PA0011: 
The sample size assumptions for bimekizumab versus placebo were based on the ACR50 response data in 
the subgroup of TNFα-IR patients from the Phase 2b bimekizumab study in a mixed prior TNFα therapy 
population of study participants with moderate-to-severe PsA (PA0008). Sample size calculations for a 
TNFα-IR population were also based on ACR50 responses at Week 16 in the SPIRIT-P2 study. 
Observed ACR50 at Week 12 results in the PA0008 TNFα-IR populations were in a small number of study 
participants; bimekizumab 160mg (n=7), 320mg (n=8), and 320mg (initial dose) plus 160mg (n=8), and 
ranged from 14.3% to 37.5%. 
The ixekizumab Phase 3 study SPIRIT–P2 was conducted on a similar patient population to that in this 
study and showed a 35% (n=122) ACR50 response at Week 16. Therefore, taking into account the range 
of ACR50 responses at Week 12 in PA0008, the estimated ACR50 response at Week 16 in the 
bimekizumab 160mg sc Q4W group was conservatively assumed to be 26%. For placebo, a similar 
approach as above was used. In the PA0008 TNFα-IR population, an ACR50 response of 11.1% (n=9) 
was observed at Week 12. The observed placebo ACR50 response at Week 16 was less than 10% in the 
SPIRIT-P2 study (n=118). Therefore, the estimated ACR50 response at Week 16 in the placebo group 
was assumed to be 10%. 
The sample size for showing statistical superiority of bimekizumab versus placebo was calculated using a 
2-sided 2-sample Chi-square test with continuity correction (Fleiss et al, 1980). Assuming 260 study 
participants in the bimekizumab group and 130 study participants in the placebo group, the test for 
detecting statistical superiority of bimekizumab 160mg versus placebo based on ACR50 response at Week 
16 had 96% power to detect a true treatment difference of 16% (odds ratio of 3.16). 
The assumptions for power calculations of the secondary endpoints included in the hierarchy and for 
which supporting data were available, in the TNFα-IR population were based on the results of PA0008 and 
the SPIRIT-P2 studies. All power calculations for binary endpoints were performed using a 2-sided 2-
sample Chi-square test with continuity correction (Fleiss et al, 1980). All power calculations for 
continuous endpoints were performed using a 2-sided 2-group Satterthwaite t-test (Moser et al, 1989).

Randomisation 
An IXRS was used for assigning eligible study participants to a treatment regimen based on a 
predetermined production randomisation and/or packaging schedule provided by UCB (or designee). The 
randomisation schedule was produced by the IXRS vendor. The IXRS generated individual assignments 
for study participant kits of IMP, as appropriate, according to the visit schedule. 
Each study participant received a 5-digit number assigned at Screening that served as the study 
participant identifier throughout the study. The IXRS automatically informed the Investigator or designee 
of the study participant’s randomisation number. The IXRS allocated kit numbers to the study participant 
based on the study participant number during the course of the study. The randomisation number was 
documented in the eCRF. 
Blinding (masking) 
Unblinded study staff were responsible for preparation of the clinical study material, including recording 
the administration information on source documents, and administration of the IMP as sc injections. The 
unblinded personnel were not involved in the study in any way other than assuring the medication was 
taken from the correct kit and administering the IMP to the study participants. All study participant 
treatment details were allocated and maintained by IXRS system. 
PA0010 
Bimekizumab, adalimumab, and placebo were administered sc by unblinded study personnel at the 
clinical site. 
Due to differences in presentation between the bimekizumab, adalimumab, and placebo treatments, 
special precautions were taken to ensure study blinding and study sites had blinded and unblinded 
personnel. As per dosing schedule for adalimumab, all study participants came to the study center for IMP 
administration at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, and then Q2W thereafter. For study participants receiving 
bimekizumab, the IMP was administered at Baseline and Q4W thereafter; dummy/placebo treatments at 
Week 2 and Q4W thereafter were administered to preserve blinding and correspond to the dosing 
schedule for adalimumab. Adalimumab study participants received adalimumab at Baseline and Q2W 
thereafter. 
After the 16-week Double-Blind Treatment Period, study participants entered the 36-week Active 
Treatment-Blind Period. Bimekizumab and adalimumab were administered sc by unblinded study 
personnel at the clinical site. 
PA0011 
Bimekizumab and placebo were administered sc by unblinded study personnel at the clinical site. The 
remaining study team, including the Investigator, the Sponsor, an independent joint assessor, and study 
participants remained blinded. 
Statistical methods 
PA0010 and PA0011 
For the primary efficacy endpoint and some secondary efficacy endpoints a step-down closed testing 
procedure was applied. The testing procedure accounted for multiplicity and controlled the family-wise 
type I error rate at alpha=0.05 (2-sided). According to this strategy, the statistical testing of an endpoint 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 91/234 
 
 
 
 
  
could be investigated only if the null hypothesis for the previous endpoint had been rejected (i.e., if 
p<0.05). Figure 34 shows the testing order for these endpoints. 
Figure 34: PA0010 and PA0011 statistical testing hierarchies 
Analysis Populations PA0010 and PA0011 
The Enrolled Set (ES) was to consist of all study participants who had given informed consent. Study 
participant dispositions are presented on the ES. 
The Randomised Set (RS) was to consist of all enrolled study participants that had been randomised. 
Demographic tables, primary, secondary and other efficacy variables are presented on the RS. 
The Safety Set (SS) was to consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the IMP. Demographic 
tables, study treatment compliance, exposure and safety variables are presented on the SS. Subjects in 
the SS were to be analysed according to the treatment they actually received. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was to consist of all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
the IMP and had valid measurements of all components of the primary efficacy variable at Baseline. 
Supportive analysis of the primary efficacy variable was performed in the FAS. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was to consist of all subjects in the RS who had no important protocol 
deviation (IPD), or non-PD related to prohibited medications affecting the primary efficacy variable (only 
IPD/non-PF related to prohibited medications observed prior to week 16 are considered for exclusion from 
the PPS). Important protocol deviations were to be predefined and study participants with important 
protocol deviations evaluated during ongoing data cleaning and data evaluation meetings prior to 
unblinding of the data. Exclusions from the FAS were considered as an IPD that also resulted in exclusion 
from the PPS. Supportive analysis of the primary efficacy variable was performed on the PPS. 
The COVID-19-free Set consisted of all study participants in the RS who had no COVID-19 impact up to 
the primary efficacy endpoint. This was defined as study participants (up to Week 16) not having a 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 92/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
COVID-19 related IPD, not having an impact based on the COVID-19 eCRF, not having an AE related to 
COVID-19 and not discontinuing due to COVID-19. 
PA0010 only: 
The Active Medication Set (AMS) was to consist of all study participants who received at least 1 dose 
of active IMP (bimekizumab or adalimumub). The AMS covers the analysis of data collected during the 
Active Medication Periods (AMP), i.e.: 
• 
• 
The Active Treatment-Blind Period for study participants randomised to placebo. 
The Double-Blind Treatment Period and the Active Treatment-Blind Period for study 
participants randomised to bimekizumab or adalimumab. 
The AMS is used for summaries of safety during the AMP. The ADAb is also analysed on the AMS for study 
participants receiving bimekizumab. 
The Active Treatment-Blind Set (ATS) was to consist of all study participants who received at least 1 
dose of active treatment (bimekizumab or adalimumab) during the Active Treatment-Blind Period (Week 
16 and after). Disposition, demographics, and Baseline characteristics are reported on the ATS. The ATS 
is also used to report data from the Active Treatment-Blind Period such as study treatment compliance 
and exposure, AEs, TEMA data for vital signs and laboratory data and selected efficacy analyses. 
The disposition data, the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary efficacy endpoints included in the 
testing hierarchy are analysed on the COVID-19-free Set. 
Efficacy analyses were to be performed according to randomisation and not actual treatment received. 
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variable PA0010 and PA0011 
The primary endpoint was the ACR50 response at Week 16. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the 
composite estimand in the Randomized Set (RS). The composite estimand combined the clinically 
meaningful improvement from Baseline in ACR50 response at Week 16 and not discontinuing IMP prior to 
Week 16. 
The following 4 attributes described this estimand: 
•  Population = Study participants enrolled according to the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and randomised to IMP. 
•  Study participant-level outcome = ACR50 at Week 16. 
• 
Intercurrent Event (IE) handling = An IE was defined as discontinuation of study treatment 
prior to Week 16. A composite strategy was implemented in which a positive clinical outcome was 
defined as achieving ACR50 at Week 16 and not discontinuing study treatment through Week 16. 
•  Population-level summary measure = Conditional OR comparing bimekizumab to placebo. 
Use of prohibited or rescue medication through week 16 was not specified as in intercurrent event, but 
implicitly handled using a treatment policy strategy. Any use of prohibited or rescue medications through 
Week 16 constituted an IPD which was accounted for when the sensitivity analysis based on the PPS was 
performed. 
Missing data at Week 16 that were not preceded by an intercurrent event (IE), and any data after an IE 
were imputed as non-responders. This resulted in a more traditional non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach. A logistic regression model was used to assess the treatment effect on ACR50 response at 
Week 16. The model included a fixed effect for treatment (and in PA0011 for prior TNFα inhibitor 
exposure and region as stratification factors). 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 93/234 
 
 
 
 
  
The suitability of including randomisation stratification variables (bone erosion at Baseline and region) 
was assessed using Pearson and Deviance and The Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Tests (Hosmer 
and Lemeshow, 2000). 
Summary table results presented the adjusted responder rates and the associated 95% CIs for the 3 
treatment groups, the adjusted OR and the corresponding 95% CI for the comparison of bimekizumab 
versus placebo, the p-value and the difference of response rate between bimekizumab and placebo and 
associated 95% CI. Comparisons of bimekizumab vs. placebo were made using the 2-sided Wald test at a 
significance level of α=0.05. 
Supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable PA0010 and PA0011 
The following supportive analyses for the primary efficacy variable were conducted: 
•  Analysis on the PPS 
•  Analysis on the FAS (to be performed if the number of study participants in RS and FAS differ) 
•  Analysis using a modified composite estimand where the single identified intercurrent event is 
defined as discontinuation due to AE or lack of efficacy 
•  Analysis of individual components of the ACR (using two forms of hypothetical estimand where 
the single intercurrent event is discontinuation of study treatment prior to week 16) 
•  Analyses using treatment policy strategy for the single identified intercurrent event of 
discontinuation of study treatment prior to week 16 
•  Analysis of observed cases 
•  Tipping point analysis, including a worst-case scenario where study participants who had missing 
ACR50 response were set as nonresponders if they were randomized to bimekizumab and as 
responders if they were randomized to placebo 
•  Analyses including COVID-19 impact 
Analyses of Key Secondary Efficacy Variables PA0010 and PA0011 
The secondary efficacy variables were analysed for all study participants in the RS by treatment group 
(except for vdHmTSS in PA0010, for which the analysis was performed on the Radiographic Set). For the 
secondary composite and non-composite binary endpoints, the same estimand structure (composite 
estimand) as the one defined for the primary efficacy analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was used.  
The NRI approach for handling missing data and the same analysis model was considered, and the 
analysis results were presented similarly, with the exceptions that the analyses performed on pooled data 
from PA0010 and PA0011 study participants considered the region and the study-id factor as possible 
covariates for the modelling.  
For the secondary continuous endpoints, the analysis evaluated the hypothetical estimand as defined 
below: 
•  Population=Study participants enrolled according to the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and randomised to IMP. 
•  Study participant level outcome=variable of interest. 
• 
IE handling=An IE was defined as discontinuation of study treatment prior to Week 16. A 
hypothetical strategy for addressing IE was implemented. This estimand targeted the treatment 
difference in a scenario where withdrawal from study treatment did not occur, such that outcomes 
for study participants without an IE were as observed, and outcomes for study participants with 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 94/234 
 
 
 
 
  
an IE were treated as though they had completed treatment through Week 16 but on placebo. A 
MI strategy was used to impute any missing data and observed data after IE which was set to 
missing prior to running MI. Such data were imputed using reference-based MI, in which the MI 
model was based on data from the placebo group.  
•  Population-level summary measure=the difference in the adjusted means between 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and placebo 
For vdHmTSS in PA0010, a similar estimand structure as that defined for continuous endpoints was used 
with the following exception for population: 
•  When analysing change at Week 16 from Baseline in vdHmTSS for study participants with 
elevated hs-CRP or with at least 1 erosion at Baseline: Population=Study participants enrolled 
according to the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomised to IMP, who had a 
valid radiographic image of the hands and feet at Baseline in the subgroup of patients with 
elevated CRP and with at least 1 bone erosion at Baseline. 
•  When analysing change at Week 16 from Baseline in vdHmTSS for all study participants: 
Population=Study participants enrolled according to the protocol-specified inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, randomised to IMP, who had a valid radiographic image of the hands and feet at 
Baseline. 
Rules for calculation of MDA response were described in the SAP. 
Enthesitis and dactylitis pooling strategy 
The original PA0010 hierarchy planned to examine dactylitis (free-state) and enthesitis (change from 
Baseline [CfB]) while the PA0011(Phase 3 study of bimekizumab in study participants with active PsA who 
were TNFα inadequate responders) hierarchy does not include either. As part of a standard blinded data 
evaluation meeting of PA0010, after approximately 50% of study participants had enrolled, to examine 
Baseline characteristics and check for data quality trends, it was discovered that the number of study 
participants with dactylitis and/or enthesitis at Baseline was lower than anticipated. Consequently, the 
number of study participants was also lower than what was used for the a priori power calculation 
assumptions for these endpoints. 
In order to provide well powered and more clinically interpretable results for dactylitis and enthesitis 
endpoints across a more robust mixed population (TNF-inadequate responders and bDMARD-naïve), the 
hierarchy was updated to remove dactylitis free-state and enthesitis (CfB) from the PA0010 study 
hierarchy and add pooled PA0010 and PA0011 endpoints for dactylitis free-state and enthesitis free-state, 
which is a more interpretable and clinically meaningful endpoint than CfB, within the PA0010 study 
hierarchy. 
PA0011 does not have either of these variables in its hierarchy; therefore, pooling within the closed 
sequential testing procedure of PA0010 did not introduce any inflation of the type 1 error within the 
PA0010 hierarchy. As the pooling was done to achieve power similar to the original a priori power, there 
was no additional adjustment to the p-value to make it more conservative. In addition to showing a 
significant result of the pooled endpoints, for the sake of interpretation, the individual studies were 
required to additionally show a similar trend that bimekizumab was numerically better than placebo. 
Analyses of Other Secondary Efficacy Variables PA0010 and PA0011 
The time to ACR20/50/70 response was analysed for the Double-Blind Treatment Period on the treatment 
groups. The Kaplan-Meier plots of time to ACR20,50,70 response are presented by treatment group. For 
binary variables, the analysis followed the NRI approach (composite estimand).  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 95/234 
 
 
 
 
  
PA0010- The analysis model was based on a logistic model with fixed effect for treatment and in PA0010, 
bone erosion at Baseline and region as stratification variables. For continuous variables, the MI-
MCMC/monotone regression approach was applied for the imputation model on the change from Baseline 
(hypothetical estimand). The analysis model was based on ANCOVA with fixed effect of treatment, region, 
bone erosion at Baseline and Baseline value as covariates. 
PA0011- For binary variables, the analysis followed the NRI approach (composite estimand). Study 
participants who had an IE, which was considered associated to a treatment failure, were considered as 
non-responders. Any missing data were also considered as non-responders (NRI approach). For 
categorical variables, the worst-category was imputed similarly instead of non-response. For continuous 
variables, the MI-MCMC/monotone regression approach was applied for the imputation model on the 
change from Baseline (hypothetical estimand). The analysis model was based on analysis of covariance, 
with fixed effect of treatment, region, and prior TNFα inhibitor exposure, and Baseline value as 
covariates. For responder variables, the analysis followed the NRI approach (composite estimand). The 
analysis model was based on a logistic model, with fixed effect for treatment and prior TNFα inhibitor 
exposure Baseline and region as stratification variables. 
Subgroup analyses PA0010 and PA0011 
Subgroup analyses were to be performed on the variables below. These variables were all assessed at 
Baseline except concomitant cDMARDs, concomitant MTX and ADAb status which were assessed during 
the 16-week Double-Blind Treatment Period.  
Subgroup analyses were to be performed on the ACR50 response, the PASI90 response and the HAQ-DI 
response (subjects with a decrease of HAQ-DI from Baseline of at least 0.35) at Week 16.  
ADAb status were also used for subgroup analysis for the PK endpoints. The variables for subgroup 
analyses were: 
•  Age (<45 years of age, ≥45 years of age) 
•  Gender (male, female) 
•  Disease duration (<1 year, ≥1 year) 
•  Region (eg, North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia) 
•  Race (White, Black and Other) 
•  Body weight at Baseline (≤100 kg, >100 kg) 
•  Bone erosion (≥1) at Baseline (Yes, No) – PA0010 only 
• 
hs-CRP at Baseline (<6mg/L, ≥6mg/L) 
•  Bone erosion (≥1) and/or hs-CRP ≥6mg/L at Baseline (Yes, No) – PA0010 only 
• 
• 
Prior TNF exposure (intolerance to TNFα inhibitor, inadequate response to at least 1 TNFα 
inhibitor, inadequate response to 2 prior or more TNFα inhibitors) – PA0011 only 
Prior cDMARDs (0, 1, ≥2) (taken prior to Baseline) 
•  Concomitantly receiving cDMARDs versus no concomitant cDMARDs 
•  Concomitantly receiving MTX versus no concomitant MTX 
•  Concomitantly receiving MTX at Baseline vs. other cDMARDs at Baseline (MTX at Baseline, no MTX 
at Baseline and cDMARDs at Baseline, no MTX at Baseline and no cDMARDs at Baseline) 
• 
PSO affected BSA at Baseline (<3%, ≥3% to 10%, >10%) 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 96/234 
 
 
 
 
  
•  BASDAI at Baseline (<4, ≥4) 
•  ADAb status (positive, negative) (for the Bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group only) 
•  Human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) (positive, negative). 
Multicentre study 
In general, the data from all centers was to be pooled for the purposes of the analysis. However, the 
effect of center (using a pooling of centers by region) on results was to be evaluated. 
The 4 geographic regions considered for the study were those used for randomisation stratification: North 
America (Canada, USA), Western Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom), 
Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia),  
Asia (Australia, Japan) identified as “Asia” 
in all analyses. 
Interim analyses 
In PA0010, two analyses were to be performed prior to the final analysis: 
•  Analysis 1: Week 24 analysis. 
•  Analysis 2: Week 52 analysis. 
No formal alterations to the further study conduct (e.g., stopping rules, sample size re-estimation, or 
changes to eligibility criteria) were planned for the 2 analyses (Week 24 and Week 52). No separate SAP 
for the Week 24 analyses was to be provided. The TFL shells for the Week 24 and the Week 52 analyses 
were provided in the same document and appropriately identified. 
The final analysis for PA0010 will consist of a rerun of all analyses provided during the preceding interim 
analysis. This includes new SFU data that were not available for the Week 52 analysis. If there is no SFU 
data ongoing, the final analysis will be identical to the Week 52 analysis. 
In PA0011, one analysis was performed prior to the final analysis at week 16. No formal alterations to the 
further study conduct (eg, stopping rules, sample size re-estimation, or changes to eligibility criteria) 
were planned for the Week 16 interim analysis. No separate SAP for the Week 16 interim analysis was 
provided; all analyses for Week 16 followed the planned analyses described in the study SAP. The 
database lock and unblinding date for the PA0011 Week 16 interim analysis used was 22 December 2021. 
The final analysis for PA0011 was completed when all participants in the SFU Period completed the SFU 
Visit and consisted of a rerun of all analyses as well as new data from the SFU Period that were not 
available for the Week 16 interim analysis. The database lock date for the final analysis was 04 March 
2022. 
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
Changes related to COVID-19 PA0010 and PA0011 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study procedures/conduct as well as the efficacy and safety 
endpoints was investigated, and additional analysis outputs are provided as appropriate. These additional 
analyses were not planned as part of the original protocol as the pandemic was not ongoing at the time of 
protocol finalisation. These additional analyses include analyses by period of the COVID-19 pandemic 
(pre/during/post) as defined below: 
•  Pre-COVID-19 pandemic period: period prior to COVID-19 pandemic start date defined as 11-
Mar-2020 
•  COVID-19 pandemic period: period from 11-Mar-2020 though the COVID-19 pandemic end date 
which is currently not defined at the time of approval of the SAP 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 97/234 
 
 
 
 
  
•  Post-COVID-19 pandemic period: period after the declaration of the end of the pandemic. (at the 
time of study conduct and data analyses, the COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing; therefore, no 
results were presented for the post-COVID period). 
PA0010 Changes to the protocol-defined analyses 
The following changes from the protocol were considered: 
•  An additional supportive analysis for primary endpoint based on the analysis of the individual 
components of ACR is performed using the Reference-Based imputation method. 
• 
• 
The main analyses of the secondary continuous variables included in the testing hierarchy will be 
performed using the Reference-Based imputation method. 
Proportion of study participants with a decrease of HAQ-DI from Baseline of at least 0.35 (HAQ-DI 
responders) in those study participants with HAQ-DI ≥0.35 instead of >0.35. 
•  An additional subgroup based on the combination of concomitant MTX and Baseline cDMARD. 
•  Additional subgroup analyses were performed on HAQ-DI responders at Week 16. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of PsAID-12 responders (decrease from Baseline in PsAID-12 total score ≥3) in study 
participants with PsAID-12 total score ≥3 at Baseline instead of >3 at Baseline. 
The subgroup analysis on BASDAI was performed on the categories: <4 vs. ≥4 rather than ≤4 vs. 
>4. 
The analysis of the proportion of responding study participants at Week 52 among those who 
responded at Week 16 is extended to all post Week 16 visits (and not only Week 52). 
The analysis of the proportion of FACIT-Fatigue subscale responders (study participants with a 
minimum clinically important difference for FACIT-Fatigue subscale score defined as an increase 
of ≥4) is performed in study participants with FACIT-Fatigue subscale score ≤48 at Baseline. 
•  The time to ACR20/50/70 is exclusively analyzed using observed cases data. 
•  The AMS is an analysis set that has been added for the analysis of safety variables. 
•  The ATS is an analysis set that has been added for the analysis of data collected during the Active 
Treatment-Blind Period. 
These changes from the protocol were reflected in the final SAP prior to unblinding. 
Regarding the summary of imaging endpoints, the SAP states that for the Week 24 analysis only the first 
reading session will be used when generating the outputs based on the imaging data. Prior to unblinding, 
it was noticed that in some cases the first reading session was missing and the second reading session 
was non-missing. In an effort to have as much available data as possible for the Week 24 analysis, the 
analysis deviated from the SAP and included data from the second reading session in cases where the 
first reading session was missing. 
PA0011 Changes to the protocol-defined analyses 
The following changes from the protocol were considered:  
•  The subgroup analysis on BASDAI was performed on the categories: <4 versus ≥4 rather than ≤4 
versus >4. 
•  Proportion of study participants with a decrease of HAQ-DI from Baseline of at least 0.35 (HAQ-DI 
responders) in those study participants with HAQ-DI ≥0.35 instead of >0.35. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 98/234 
 
 
 
 
  
•  Proportion of PsAID-12 responders (decrease from Baseline in PsAID-12 total score ≥3) in study 
participants with PsAID-12 total score ≥3 at Baseline instead of >3 at Baseline. 
•  An additional supportive analysis for primary endpoint based on the analysis of the individual 
components of ACR was performed using the Reference-Based imputation method. 
•  The main analyses of the secondary continuous variables included in the testing hierarchy were 
performed using the Reference-Based imputation method. 
•  Additional subgroup analyses were performed for HAQ-DI responders at Week 16. 
•  Additional subgroups based on the combination of concomitant MTX and baseline cDMARDs.

Recruitment 
During the course of this study, recruitment was halted for approximately 2 months (20 March 2020 to 22 
May 2020) due to the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. Any study participants who were in the screening 
process during that timeframe were captured as screen failures. 
PA0010 
A total of 1163 study participants signed the ICF and were screened for the study, 311 of whom were 
screen failures. The most common reason for being a screen failure was ineligibility (245 study 
participants [78.8%]).  
PA0011 
A total of 556 study participants signed the ICF and were screened for the study, 156 of whom were 
screen failures. The most common reason for being a screen failure was ineligibility (124 study 
participants [79.5%]).  
Conduct of the study 
Changes to the Conduct of the Study PA0010 and PA0011 
The original PA0010 protocol (dated 28 November 2018) and PA0011 protocol (dated 29 November 2018) 
have undergone 2 global protocol amendments each and additional local (Japan) protocol amendments. 
Global protocol amendments: 
PA0010 
Protocol Amendment 1 (10 January 2020) was implemented to update the completed and ongoing studies 
information, clarify study procedures, update the description of the IMP, and to apply a minimum 
percentage for enrolment of study participants who had elevated hs-CRP and/or have at least 1 bone 
erosion at Screening. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (22 February 2021) was implemented to modify the secondary variables and fixed 
sequence testing procedure, update the statistical section, and make other procedural clarifications. 
PA0011 
Protocol Amendment 1 (14 May 2020) was implemented to update the completed and ongoing studies 
information, clarify study procedures, add re-screening rules, update the description of IMP, change the 
statistical hierarchy, and update the statistical section. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (01 April 2021) was implemented to modify the secondary variables and fixed 
sequence testing procedure, update the statistical section, and make other procedural clarifications. 
COVID-19 impact: 
In accordance with the released guidance documents for clinical trial conduct during the COVID-19 
pandemic by local Health Authorities, the study eCRF was updated by adding a specific page to record 
any COVID-19 impact on study assessments.  
Additionally, a study-specific contingency plan was developed to ensure participant safety and data 
integrity during the pandemic. The contingency plan provided options to sites which could be applied in 
case of severe local COVID-19 restrictions.

Protocol Deviations 
Impact of COVID-19 PA0010 
No more than 2 study participants (0.2%) at any given visit had a visit not done due to COVID-19 
through Week 24. No study participant permanently discontinued IMP or missed IMP administration due 
to COVID-19 before Week 16. Two study participants discontinued IMP after Week 16 (1 [0.2%] in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group at Week 20 and 1 [0.4%] in the placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group at Week 28); both were due to general circumstances around COVID-19 without infection. No more 
than 6 participants (0.7%) overall missed IMP administration at any given visit. 
Table 30: Important protocol deviations – double blind treatment period (RS) 
Impact of COVID-19 PA0011 
No more than 1 study participant (0.3%) at any given visit missed a visit due to COVID-19. Visits were 
not done for these participants at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 (1 participant each). Visits out of window were 
reported by 1 participant (0.3%), 3 participants (0.8%), and 14 participants (3.5%) for Weeks 8, 12, and 
16, respectively. One participant in the placebo group discontinued IMP due to general circumstances 
around COVID-19 without infection. The majority of study participants were enrolled during the pandemic 
(n=234) rather than before the pandemic (n=166). There was no pattern of enrollment differences 
between the treatment groups. Overall, only 1 study participant had efficacy assessments impacted by 
COVID-19.

PA0010 Double-Blind Treatment Period- Protocol Deviations 
After the database lock for the Week 24 interim analysis, new important protocol deviations (IPDs) were 
identified which impacted the PPS. Six study participants were added to and 9 were excluded from the 
initial Per-Protocol Set (PPS) after the interim analysis based on the assessment of IPD by the blinded 
study team. The impact of this change on the efficacy in PPS was minimal, and the overall conclusions 
were not impacted.  
Most study participants (87.8%) had no IPDs during the Double-Blind Treatment Period (Table 32). The 
incidence of IPDs was similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (11.1%), adalimumab (12.9%), and 
placebo (13.5%) groups. Overall, the most common IPDs were procedural noncompliance (5.3%) and 
prohibited concomitant medication use (4.1%); the incidence of these were similar across treatment 
groups. The most common reason for procedural noncompliance was due to a missed assessment at 
either Baseline or Week 16. A total of 15 study participants (1.8%) had other IPDs related to COVID-19, 
these were most frequently due to X-rays not collected at Week 16.  
The incidence of study participants who were excluded from the PPS overall was 5.3%; the incidence was 
similar in the bimekizumab 160 Q4W (5.1%), placebo (5.7%), and adalimumab (5.0%) groups. No study 
participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were excluded from the PK-PPS due to IPDs.

Table 32: Important protocol deviations – double blind treatment period (RS) 
PA0010 Active Treatment-Blind Period- Protocol Deviations 
Most study participants (96.7%) had no important protocol deviations during the Active Treatment-Blind 
Period (Table 33). The incidence of important protocol deviations was similar in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W (2.7%), adalimumab (3.7%), and placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (4.1%) groups. Overall, the 
most common important protocol deviations were procedural noncompliance (2.3%); the incidence of 
these were generally similar across treatment groups. No study participants were excluded from the PK-
PPS.

Table 33: Important protocol deviations – active treatment blind period (ATS) 
PA0011 Protocol Deviations 
Most study participants (91.0%) had no IPDs during the study (Table 34). The incidence of IPDs was 
similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (9.0%) and placebo (8.3%) groups. Overall, the most common 
IPDs were inclusion criteria deviation and procedural noncompliance; the incidence of these was similar 
between treatment groups. The most common reasons for inclusion criteria deviation were that the 
participant was not on a stable dose of NSAID or oral corticosteroid, or MTX prior to Baseline and 
remained on a stable dose throughout the duration of the study. Four study participants did not meet the 
criteria of having a proper washout period after prior TNF. 
A total of 2 study participants (0.5%) had other IPDs related to COVID-19: an out of window visit at 
Week 16 and PK samples not collected at Week 12 (1 participant each).  
The incidence of study participants who were excluded from the PPS was low overall (4.5%) with the 
same incidences in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and placebo groups (4.5%). Two study participants 
(0.5%; 1 participant from each treatment group) were excluded from the PK-PPS. The reasons for 
exclusion from the PK-PPS were due to procedural noncompliance and COVID-19 other important protocol 
deviation (1 study participant each).

Baseline data 
Demography 
A total of 1112 study participants with active PsA were randomised to receive either bimekizumab or 
placebo in the Phase 3 studies PA0010 and PA0011. In PA0010, there were an additional 140 study 
participants with PsA randomised to receive adalimumab in the active reference arm. All study 
participants came from the regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. 
The mean age of study participants was 49.3 years and approximately half the study participants 
(51.6%) were in the age category 45 to <65 years of age. The majority of study participants were female 
EMA/235043/2023

(53.4%) and White (95.7%) with a mean body weight and mean BMI of 85.33kg and 29.50kg/m2, 
respectively. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics (Overall) 
Overall, the mean time since diagnosis of PsA was 7.15 years (range: 0.0 to 56.0 years). In PA0010, the 
mean time since diagnosis of PsA was 5.87 years overall (range: 0.0 to 49.8 years), while in PA0011, the 
mean time since diagnosis of PsA was longer (9.50 years overall [range: 0.4 to 56 years]), given that 
study participants in PA0011 had more advanced disease by study design.  
Approximately 10% of study participants in Pool E1 had moderate to severe PSO disease. The mean time 
since diagnosis of PSO was 15.94 years overall (range: 0.0 to 58.5 years) The mean PASI score was 
8.71, and 55.9% of participants had ≥3% of BSA affected by PSO.  
Study participants had active disease across multiple domains of PsA including dactylitis, enthesitis, and 
skin and nail disease. Overall, 57.7% of study participants had nail PSO, 12.3% of study participants had 
dactylitis, and approximately one-third had enthesitis (38.6% by SPARCC and 31.9% by LEI). 
Study participants with different subtypes of PsA were enrolled across the bDMARD naïve and TNFα-IR 
populations in bimekizumab studies. In both study populations, the majority of study participants had 
polyarticular arthritis (63.5%) with oligoarticular arthritis as the second largest group (25.9%). 
Baseline Disease Characteristics- PA0010 
The majority of study participants were White (95.4%) and over half of the participants were female 
(53.2%). The mean age of all study participants was 48.65 years of age, mean body weight and mean 
body mass index (BMI) overall were 84.63kg and 29.20kg/m2, respectively. 
The mean time since diagnosis of PSO was 15.13 years overall (range: 0.0 to 57.0 years). The mean 
PASI score was 8.14 and 49.9% of participants had ≥3% of BSA affected by PSO. Overall, 55.8% of 
study participants had nail PSO, 11.7% of study participants had dactylitis and approximately one-third 
had enthesitis (35.2% by SPARCC and 29.2% by LEI). 
In the Double-Blind Treatment Period, 78.3% of the study participants had prior exposure to one or more 
conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs). At Baseline, the majority of study participants were using nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug therapy (58.6%) and/or cDMARDs (69.5%, primarily methotrexate [58.2%]). 
Approximately three-quarters of study participants (77.0% overall) had ≥1 bone erosion at Baseline 
(actual stratum), and 84.2% of study participants had ≥1 bone erosion and/or hs-CRP ≥6mg/mL at 
Baseline. 
Active-Treatment Blind Period- At the time of the data cut date for this Week 24 CSR, the percentages of 
study participants who completed the Active Treatment-Blind Period were similar in the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W (76.3%), the adalimumab (77.9%), and the placebo/bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (80.4%) 
groups. At the time of the Week 24 data cut, 640 study participants had completed the study, of which at 
least 631 study participants (98.6%) had entered the OLE study. The demographics and baseline disease 
characteristics of study participants who entered the Active Treatment-Blind Period were similar to the 
demographics of those in the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
Notable differences in Baseline characteristics across treatment groups include: 
• 
The proportion of study participants with PsA subtype of polyarticular symmetric arthritis at 
Baseline was numerically higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (62.9%) and placebo (64.4%) 
groups compared with the adalimumab group (51.4%). Conversely, the proportion of study 
participants with PsA subtype of oligoarticular asymmetric arthritis was numerically lower in the 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 107/234 
 
 
 
 
  
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (27.4%) and placebo (27.0%) groups compared with the adalimumab 
group (37.9%). 
• 
• 
The mean HAQ-DI score at Baseline was numerically higher in the placebo group (0.8906) and 
adalimumab (0.8589) groups compared with the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.8189). 
The proportion of study participants with enthesitis, whether determined by SPARCC or LEI, was 
numerically higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (38.5% and 33.2%, respectively) and 
adalimumab (31.4% and 25.7%, respectively) groups compared with the placebo group (32.0% 
and 24.9%, respectively).

Baseline Disease Characteristics- PA0011 
The mean age of all study participants was 50.52 years of age with a range of 20.0 to 85.0 years of age. 
Slightly over half of the participants were female (52.5%), and the majority of study participants were 
White (96.0%), and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (99.0%). The mean body weight and mean BMI 
overall were 85.99kg and 29.76kg/m2, respectively. For both treatment groups, the proportions of study 
participants enrolled in each region were similar (region was a stratification factor for randomisation). 
The mean time since diagnosis of PsA was 9.50 years overall (range: 0.4 to 56 years). The majority of 
study participants had the polyarticular symmetric arthritis subtype of PsA (63.5%). Treatment groups 
were generally well balanced with respect to PsA-related and other Baseline disease characteristics. The 
mean time since diagnosis of PSO was 17.41 years overall (range: 0.0 to 58.5 years). The mean PASI 
score was 9.58 and 66.0% of participants had ≥3% of BSA affected by PSO. Overall, 60.5% of study

participants had nail PSO, 12.0% of study participants had dactylitis, and approximately 40% had 
enthesitis (43.3% by SPARCC and 35.5% by LEI).  
Notable differences in Baseline disease characteristics across treatment groups included: 
•  The proportion of study participants with >10% BSA affected by PSO at Baseline was numerically 
higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (25.1%) compared with the placebo group 
(18.8%).  
•  The proportion of study participants with PASI score <10 at Baseline was numerically lower in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (41.9%) compared with the placebo group (50.4%). 
•  The proportion of study participants with enthesitis, whether determined by SPARCC or LEI was 
numerically higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (45.7% and 39.7%, respectively) 
compared with the placebo group (38.3% and 27.1%, respectively). 
•  A numerically lower proportion of participants in the bimekizumab160mg Q4W group reported 
NSAID therapy at Baseline (53.6%) compared with the placebo group (60.2%).  
•  A numerically higher proportion of participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group reported 
MTX at Baseline (44.6%) compared with the placebo group (38.3%).

Prior and concomitant diseases  
PA0010  
Overall, the majority (87.8%) of study participants in the SS reported a previous and ongoing medical 
condition at Baseline. The most frequently reported conditions/diseases at Baseline were in the SOCs of 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders (54.3%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (39.7%), 
and Vascular disorders (39.4%). The incidences of previous or ongoing medical conditions/diseases at 
Baseline by SOC were generally similar across treatment groups. 
Overall, the most frequently reported conditions/diseases at Baseline by PT were hypertension (36.0%), 
obesity (35.9%), and osteoarthritis (14.8%). The incidences of previous or ongoing medical 
conditions/diseases at Baseline by PT were generally similar across treatment groups.  
PA0011 
Overall, the majority (89.2%) of study participants in the SS reported a previous and ongoing medical 
condition at Baseline. This was generally similar across the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (88.4%) and 
placebo (90.9%) groups. 
The most frequently reported conditions/diseases at Baseline were in the SOCs of Metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (52.6%), Vascular disorders (44.6%), and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint and ranked secondary endpoints were evaluated using a fixed-sequence testing 
procedure to account for multiplicity. According to this procedure, the statistical testing of an endpoint 
was investigated only if the null hypothesis for the previous endpoint had been rejected (i.e., if p<0.05). 
For both PA0010 and PA0011, the RS was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses, but analyses 
were also repeated on the FAS and the PPS for the primary efficacy endpoint. The FAS analysis evaluated 
whether there were differences in the efficacy analysis between randomised study participants and 
randomised study participants with a Baseline assessment, while the PPS analysis evaluated the effect of 
IPD on the analysis. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
PA0010 ACR50 responder rate at Week 16 
The primary objective was met. Bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment demonstrated a superior ACR50 
responder rate at Week 16 compared with the placebo group (43.9% vs 10.0%, respectively). This 
difference was considered clinically meaningful, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo of 
7.082 (p<0.001).

Sensitivity/Supportive Analysis  
The results of all supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable confirmed the primary efficacy 
results (Figure 38), even in the worst-case scenario where all missing data in the placebo group were 
treated as response and all missing data in the bimekizumab group were treated as non-response. The 
COVID-19 pandemic had a minimal impact on the primary efficacy results.

Supportive analyses of individual ACR components (TJC, SJC, PGA-PsA, PhGA-PsA, PtAAP, HAQ-DI, and 
hs-CRP) at Week 16 were also conducted. The trend in ACR50 responder rate observed overall for 
bimekizumab compared with placebo was supported by that observed for each individual component both 
using reference-based imputation and MI (all nominal p<0.001). Results also showed that none of the 
individual ACR components drove the overall ACR50 response at Week 16 (Figure 39).

Sensitivity/Supportive Analysis  
The results of all supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable were consistent with the primary 
efficacy results (Figure 40), even in the worst-case scenario where all missing data in the placebo group 
were treated as response, and all missing data in the bimekizumab group were treated as nonresponse. 
The COVID-19 pandemic had a minimal impact on the primary efficacy results.

FACIT-Fatigue subscale 
The mean Baseline FACIT-Fatigue subscale scores were generally similar across treatment groups. 
Consistently greater mean increases from Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue subscale score (i.e., improvement) 
were observed in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 4 that 
continued through Week 16 (both nominal p<0.001).  
After Week 16, the improvement observed in mean FACIT-Fatigue subscale score with bimekizumab 
treatment was generally maintained up to Week 24. In study participants who switched from placebo to 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W at Week 16, the mean FACIT-Fatigue subscale score improved from Week 16 
to Week 24.  
Clinically meaningful improvements in FACIT-Fatigue subscale score were observed at Week 24 across all 
treatment groups as indicated by the mean changes that are all above the 4-point threshold for within-
patient clinically meaningful improvement (Cella et al, 2019). 
The FACIT-Fatigue subscale response with bimekizumab treatment was sustained up to Week 52. In 
study participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W at Week 16, the FACIT-
Fatigue subscale responder rate increased rapidly from Week 16 and was sustained up to Week 52.

DAPSA score categories 
PA0010 
From Week 2, the DAPSA rate for LDA or better response was higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group compared with the placebo group (17.4% vs 3.6%, respectively; nominal p<0.001); this difference 
was considered clinically meaningful. The DAPSA rate for LDA or better response for study participants in 
the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group increased through Week 16 and was higher compared with the 
placebo group at each timepoint (all nominal p<0.001). The DAPSA rate for LDA or better response with 
bimekizumab treatment was maintained up to Week 24. 
In study participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W at Week 16, the DAPSA 
rate for LDA or better response increased from Week 16 to Week 24. The DAPSA rate for LDA or better 
response was similar between the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and adalimumab groups over time.  
PA0011 
From Week 4, the DAPSA rates for low disease activity and REM response were higher in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (18.7% and 1.1%, respectively) compared with the placebo group 
(5.3% and 0%, respectively); and nominal p<0.001; these differences were considered clinically 
meaningful. The DAPSA rates for low disease activity and REM response for study participants in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group increased through Week 16 and were higher compared with the placebo 
group at each time point (all nominal p<0.001). 
The mean reduction in DAPSA scores showed similar improvements in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group compared with the placebo group. 
mNAPSI resolution from Baseline by visit

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis PA0010 and PA0011 
Subgroups analysed include the following assessed at Baseline: age, gender, disease duration, 
geographical region, race, body weight, hs-CRP, prior cDMARDs, PSO affected BSA, BASDAI, and HLA-
B27. Additionally, subgroups of concomitant cDMARD use, concomitant MTX, and ADAb positive/negative 
status during the study were included. 
The PA0010 subgroup analyses also included bone erosion and bone erosion and/or hs CRP≥6mg/L, both 
assessed at Baseline.  
The PA0011 subgroup analysis also included prior inadequate or intolerant response to TNF inhibitors. 
PA0010 
Subgroup analyses were conducted at Week 16 for ACR50 response, PASI90 response, and HAQ DI 
response across the following subgroups: age (<45 years of age, ≥45 years of age), gender (male, 
female), disease duration (<1 year, ≥1 year), region (North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, 
Asia), race (White, Other), body weight at Baseline (≤100kg, >100kg), bone erosion (≥1) at Baseline 
(Yes, No), hs-CRP at Baseline (<6mg/L, ≥6mg/L), bone erosion (≥1) and/or hs-CRP ≥6mg/L at Baseline 
(Yes, No), prior cDMARDs (0, 1, ≥2), concomitantly receiving cDMARDs vs no concomitant cDMARDs, 
concomitantly receiving MTX vs no concomitant MTX, concomitantly receiving MTX vs. cDMARDs at 
Baseline (concomitant MTX, no concomitant MTX and cDMARDs at Baseline, no concomitant MTX and no 
cDMARDs at Baseline), PSO affected BSA at Baseline (<3%, ≥3% to 10%, >10%), BASDAI at Baseline 
(<4, ≥4), antidrug antibody (ADAb) status (positive, negative) (for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
only), human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA B27) (positive, negative).  
Improvements in ACR50, PASI90, and HAQ-DI responses at Week 16 were observed for the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group across all subgroups that were generally considered 
clinically meaningful.  
A higher response was observed in study participants <45 years old than those ≥45 years old and for 
males than females in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group for all 3 endpoints; these differences were not 
observed in the placebo group. Similar improvements in efficacy were observed in study participants 
irrespective of whether they were receiving concomitant cDMARDs (MTX or other cDMARDs) or no 
cDMARDs.

Dose Rationale 
Dosing recommendation in patients with active PsA  
• 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W  
Pooled efficacy data from Pool E1 
Results of the Phase 3 pooled efficacy data from Pool E1 (PA0010 and PA0011) showed that a 
bimekizumab 160mg dose Q4W in the Initial Treatment Period demonstrated a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful separation from placebo at Week 16 on the primary efficacy variable ACR50. Overall, 
43.7% of study participants receiving bimekizumab were ACR50 responders at Week 16 compared with 
8.9% of study participants on placebo (nominal p<0.001). Consistent, clinically meaningful improvements 
in ACR50 and PASI90 response were observed for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with 
the placebo group at Week 16 across all subgroups. 
Combined PK-PD model of the ER relationship between bimekizumab concentrations and ACR responses. 
Using the combined ACR response data from Phase 2 (PA0008) and Phase 3 studies (PA0010 and 
PA0011), a PK/PD analysis was conducted to describe the relationship between bimekizumab 
concentration and ACR responses. The simulation results confirm that bimekizumab 160mg Q4W is the 
appropriate dose regimen for maximal ACR response, since the majority of patients with PsA will maintain 
steady-state concentrations with this dose at or near the plateau of the exposure-ACR relationship. 
Exposure-Response relationships for Safety  
Bimekizumab plasma trough concentrations following 160mg Q4W in Phase 3 studies were not associated 
with clinically-relevant increases in incidences of TEAEs or infection TEAEs. Bimekizumab doses up to 
320mg Q4W were tested in the Phase 2b study PA0008 and all doses were consistent with the known 
safety profile.  
Dosing recommendation in patients with active PsA who have moderate to severe plaque PSO 
• 
• 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for the first 16 weeks and Q8W thereafter. 
body weight ≥120kg, continued dosing with 320mg Q4W after Week 16 may be considered. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 139/234 
 
 
 
 
  
•  After 16 weeks, regular assessment of efficacy is recommended and if a sufficient clinical 
response in joints cannot be maintained, a switch to 160mg every 4 weeks can be considered. 
Subgroup analysis PA0010- PSO affected % BSA at Baseline 
A trend toward lower response was observed in study participants with ≥3 to 10% BSA at Baseline than 
in those with BSA>10% for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (57.6% vs 68.5%, respectively). Small 
differences between subgroups were observed for the placebo (4.3% vs 0%, respectively) and 
adalimumab groups (42.9% vs 38.5%, respectively). 
A summary of PASI90 response at Week 16 by subgroup is provided for the RS (non-responder 
imputation and observed case) in Table 55.

Subgroup analysis PA0011- PSO affected % BSA at Baseline 
For the bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W group, a numerically higher response was observed in study 
participants with ≥3% to 10% BSA at Baseline compared with those with BSA >10% for (71.6% vs 
64.2%, respectively). Similar differences between subgroups were observed for the placebo group (9.5%

Efficacy Endpoint (Observed Cases and Non-Responder Imputation)  
Analysis Set: Randomized Set (subjects with PSO involving at least 3% BSA at Baseline) 
For comparison: Ranked secondary endpoint PA0011- In study participants with PSO involving at least 
3% BSA at Baseline, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher PASI90 responder rate compared 
with the placebo group at Week 16 (68.8% vs 6.8%, respectively; p<0.001). 
Pooled efficacy data from Pool E1 
Results of the Phase 3 pooled efficacy data from Pool E1 (PA0010 and PA0011) showed that among study 
participants with PSO involving at least 3% BSA at Baseline, 64.6% of study participants receiving 
bimekizumab were PASI90 responders at Week 16 (a secondary efficacy variable) compared with 4.4% 
on placebo (nominal p<0.001) 
Baseline body weight covariate analysis 
Baseline body weight was the covariate that had the largest impact on PK and PASI responses, 
respectively. Bimekizumab exposure decreased with increasing body weight, and the PASI90 response 
appeared to be more sensitive to body weight changes compared with PASI75. Simulations based on the 
final PASI model in study participants with PsA showed that participants weighing ≥120kg had a ~12% 
lower PASI90 response rate at Week 48 compared with participants weighing <120kg following 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W continuous dosing. These results suggest patients with PsA and concomitant 
moderate to severe PSO weighing ≥120kg may benefit from an increased dose or dosing frequency to 
maintain maximal PASI90 responses. 
Combined PK-PD model of the ER relationship between bimekizumab concentrations and PASI score. 
Using combined PASI score data from Phase 2 (PA0008) and Phase 3 studies (PA0010 and PA0011), a 
PK/PD analysis was conducted to describe the relationships between bimekizumab concentration and PASI 
scores, and to evaluate potential covariates that may impact the PASI response of bimekizumab in 
participants with PsA. 
Compared to 160 mg Q4W, the simulations showed more prominent effect for the higher dose regimen of 
320 mg Q4W on week 16 PASI90 than PASI75 response rates. The time course of PASI90 response rate 
also demonstrated faster onset of response after treatment initiation with 320 mg Q4W compared with 
160 mg Q4W. These results provide support for the proposed dose of 320 mg Q4W for treatment 
initiation in patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe PSO.

Figure 47: Predicted median Week 16 PASI75 and PASI90 response rates versus dose 
(CL0540) 
PK and PK/PD modeling with bimekizumab 320mg Q8W on ACR responses. 
Pharmacokinetic simulations demonstrated substantial overlap in the distributions of simulated trough 
concentrations with bimekizumab 320mg Q8W and bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. This may suggest limited 
risk in a small proportion of patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe PSO.  
The potential risk of reduced ACR responses with bimekizumab 320mg Q8W is further mitigated by the 
current flexibility in the recommended dose for patients with moderate to severe PSO. This allows some 
patients weighing ≥120kg to continue dosing with 320mg Q4W after Week 16, thereby resulting in similar 
or higher bimekizumab exposure than with 160mg Q4W and limiting potential impact on ACR response 
(see discussion). 
Clinical and PK/PD modelling results in PSO development programme  
PK/PD evidence from study participants with moderate to severe PSO in the PSO development program 
showed that the majority of study participants’ average bimekizumab concentrations at Week 16 were at 
or close to the top of the exposure-response curve with 320mg Q4W. A 160mg Q4W dose resulted in 
lower plasma concentrations in approximately half of all study participants, which is predicted to lead to a 
lower response at Week 16. Thus, bimekizumab 320mg Q4W was selected as the appropriate dose for 
maximal PASI response during initial treatment for patients with moderate to severe PSO. Similarly, 
previous PK/PD modeling of PASI in study participants with moderate to severe PSO indicated that 
bimekizumab 320mg Q8W is appropriate for the maintenance of response in the majority of participants. 
The observed bimekizumab 90th percentile concentration range for the 320mg Q8W dose generally 
overlapped the 320mg Q4W dose at Week 56 (providing similar coverage of the exposure-response 
curve), except at the lower end of the concentration range where study participants tended to have 
higher body weights. Furthermore, simulations showed that the median predicted PASI90 and PASI100 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 142/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
response rates for study participants with body weights ≥120kg started to diverge after 16 weeks for the 
2 tested Phase 3 dosing regimens (ie, continuous 320mg Q4W and 320mg Q4W up to Week 16 followed 
by 320mg Q8W). This was more evident with patient-preferred and clinically meaningful endpoints, such 
as PASI100, indicating that some study participants ≥120kg are likely to benefit from continued dosing 
with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W after Week 16.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pool E1: data from PA0010 and PA0011 
Table 57: Overview of efficacy pool 
The eligibility criteria of these 2 studies were the same, with the exception that PA0010 required study 
participants to be bDMARD-naïve and be able to receive adalimumab, while PA0011 required study 
participants to have a history of inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or 2 prior TNFα inhibitors (TNFα-

IR) for either PsA or PSO. Both studies used the same dose, dosage form, and dosing schedule of 
bimekizumab from Week 0 to Week 16.  
PA0010 study participants randomised to adalimumab were excluded from this pool. Study participants 
from PA0007 (Phase 1b) and PA0008 (Phase 2b) were excluded from pooling due to multiple study design 
differences compared with the 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies.  
No formal analysis of efficacy results across studies was submitted as part of the PA0010 updated efficacy 
data, up to Week 52. 
Pool E1 efficacy variables

Additionally, the following efficacy variables over the time were described:  
•  Percentage of study participants achieving PASI75/100 in those with PSO involving at least 
3% BSA at Baseline 
•  Percentage of study participants achieving an improvement from Baseline, i.e., change from 
Baseline in HAQ-DI of at least 0.35 (HAQ-DI response) in study participants with Baseline 
HAQ DI ≥0.35. 
•  Change from Baseline in BASDAI 
All analyses and outputs based on PASI, IGA, Leeds Dactylitis Index (LDI), LEI, and SPARCC, were based 
on study participants with PSO involving at least 3% BSA, psoriatic lesions at Baseline, Baseline LDI>0, 
Baseline LEI>0, and SPARCC>0, respectively. 
Analyses of Pool E1 efficacy data 
The analysis methods for Pool E1 were the same as those described for the individual studies (PA0010 
and PA0011) and followed the estimand structure outlined for those variables. The only difference was 
that the stratification variables for the imputation model and for the statistical model were region and 
study. 
For all endpoints examined over time, statistical testing was performed at each time point. The associated 
p-values were considered nominal and not controlled for multiplicity. 
For continuous variables, the MI-MCMC/monotone regression approach was applied for the imputation 
model on the change from Baseline (hypothetical estimand). The analysis model was based on ANCOVA 
with fixed effect of treatment, region, study ID, and Baseline value as covariates. 
For responder variables, the analysis followed the NRI approach (composite estimand). The analysis 
model was based on a logistic model with fixed effect for treatment, region, and study ID as stratification 
variables. 
The missing data methods applied in PA0010, PA0011, and Pool E1 are identical in principle. Different 
approaches were used to handle missing data, including how the intercurrent events were to be 
considered. An intercurrent event was defined as a discontinuation from study treatment prior to the 
given week of interest 
Pool E1 subgroup analysis 
Consistency of treatment effect for the primary efficacy variable (ACR50 response at Week 16) and for 
select secondary efficacy variables (HAQ-DI, PASI90, and MDA responses at Week 16) were evaluated 
within individual subgroups of study participants based on Pool E1. Subgroup analyses were also 
performed on the other efficacy variables of ACR20 and ACR70 responses at Week 16. The complete list 
of subgroups considered is provided in Table 59, variables were the same as those that were analysed in 
both PA0010 and PA0011, with the addition of subgroups for Baseline BMI, moderate/severe PSO 
(defined as BSA >10% and IGA ≥3 and PASI ≥12) at Baseline, and NAb status during the study.

Table 59: Categories of variable for subgroup analyses 
Pool E1 Results 
There were minor differences in study participant disposition across the subgroups. The differences 
varied, and no trends were apparent. Overall, in Pool E1, more study participants <45 years (4.0%) 
discontinued from the Initial Treatment Period compared with participants ≥45years (3.1%), <65years 
(3.6%), and ≥65 years (2.2%). In study participants <45 years Initial Treatment Period discontinuation 
rate was slightly lower in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (2.8%) than in the placebo group (5.9%). 
The most common reason for discontinuation across treatment groups in this subgroup was withdrawal by 
participant (0.8% and 3.3% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and placebo groups, respectively), In all 
other age groups, the reasons for discontinuation occurred at a similar and low incidence across the 
treatment groups.

Figure 48: ACR50 response rate at Week 16 by subgroups age, gender, race, geographical 
region, disease duration, Baseline body weight, and Baseline BMI (NRI; Pool E1) 
Bimekizumab demonstrated similar levels of response in both bDMARD naïve (PA0010) and TNFα-IR 
(PA0011) patient populations across multiple joint and skin domains. In both Phase 3 studies, treatment 
with bimekizumab demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically superior response rates (p<0.001) 
for the primary efficacy variable (ACR50 at Week 16) and all ranked secondary efficacy variables (all p≤
0.008) in their respective statistical hierarchies. 
Pooled analyses based on Pool E1 were performed as prespecified in the ISAP. Results for the efficacy 
analyses of Pool E1 were consistent with the results for the individual studies: bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
treatment was superior compared with placebo for the primary efficacy variable (ACR50 response at 
Week 16) and all secondary efficacy variables at Week 16 (Table 60). Overall, these results were 
considered clinically meaningful.

Supportive analyses of individual ACR components (TJC, SJC, PGA-PsA, PhGA-PsA, PtAAP, HAQ-DI, and 
hs-CRP) at Week 16 were also conducted. The trend in ACR50 responder rate observed overall for 
bimekizumab compared with placebo was supported by that observed for each individual component 
using reference-based multiple imputation, multiple imputation, reference-based multiple imputation 
including ANCOVA and MI including ANCOVA (all nominal p<0.001).

BASDAI change from Baseline by visit 
In Pool E1, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a greater mean decrease from Baseline (i.e., 
improvement) in BASDAI compared with the placebo group from Week 4 (-1.3 vs -0.5, respectively). The 
BASDAI change from Baseline for study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group decreased 
further through Week 16 compared with the placebo group at each time point. Similar results were 
observed for the BASDAI change from Baseline by visit using OC. Comparable results were observed for 
the BASDAI change from Baseline by visit in the individual Phase 3 studies.  
Table 63: PsA and PSO history and other Baseline disease characteristics (Pool E1) 
Comparison of Pool E1 results in subgroups 
Subgroup analyses were performed on Pool E1 for the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR50 response at 
Week 16) and for select secondary and other efficacy endpoints (HAQ-DI, MDA, PASI90, PASI100, ACR20, 
and ACR70 responses at Week 16). 
Consistent, clinically meaningful improvements in ACR50 response were observed for the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 16 across all subgroups with the exception 
of age, gender, hs-CRP, and %BSA affected by PSO. 
Response rates in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were higher in participants with BMI 18.5 
to<25kg/m2 (48.8%) and BMI 25 to<30kg/m2 (49.1%) compared with participants with BMI and ≥
30kg/m2 (36.7%). Differences in response for the BMI<18.5kg/m2 subgroup were attributed to the low 
number of study participants (n=6). Response rates in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were higher 
in participants weighing ≤120kg (44.7%) compared with participants weighing >120kg (26.3%). 
Differences in response for the >120kg subgroup were attributed to the low number of study participants 
(n=38). 
The ACR50 response at Week 16 in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was similar across subgroups 
irrespective of whether the study participants were receiving concomitant cDMARDs or not (44.1% and 
43.0%, respectively). Moreover, even within the subgroup receiving cDMARDs, similar efficacy was 
demonstrated for concomitant MTX (43.9%) or other cDMARDs (including leflunomide, sulfasalazine, etc) 
(44.9%), although the subgroup with other cDMARDs was relatively smaller.

cDMARD/MTX at Baseline, % BSA affected by PSO, moderate/severe PSO, and BASDAI 
category (NRI; Pool E1) 
Subgroup analyses for select secondary and other efficacy endpoints (HAQ-DI, MDA, PASI90, PASI100, 
ACR20, and ACR70 responses at Week 16) showed consistent, clinically meaningful improvements in 
response for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 16 across all 
subgroups. There were variations of difference seen in subgroup analysis, in the PASI responses there as 
the least interaction with treatment for any of the subgroups.  
The responses for other select secondary endpoints at Week 16 in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
was similar across subgroups irrespective of whether the study participants were receiving concomitant 
cDMARDs or not. Moreover, even within the subgroup receiving cDMARDs, similar efficacy was 
demonstrated for concomitant MTX or other cDMARD. 
Supportive studies 
Additional supportive efficacy from Phase 2 study PA0008 and supportive long-term efficacy from Phase 2 
study PA0009 (cumulatively up to 152 weeks) and data from the Phase 1b study, PA0007.

PA0007 Phase 1b study 
Phase 1b, randomised, study participant-blind, Investigator-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose 
administration study to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD profiles of bimekizumab administered 
intravenously (iv) to study participants with active PsA who had an inadequate response to at least 1 
nonbiologic DMARD and/or 1 approved bDMARD.  
Bimekizumab treatment duration was 6 weeks, with study participants receiving a loading dose on Week 
1 followed by a maintenance dose at Weeks 4 and 7. The loading/maintenance doses used were 80/40mg 
(N=6), 160/80mg (N=6), 240/160mg (N=20), and 560/320mg (N=6) (PK Per-Protocol Set analysis 
population). Fourteen study participants were randomised to receive placebo.

Efficacy results 
The disease characteristics of the overall population at Baseline were indicative of participants with 
moderate to severe PsA. Overall, the mean age of participants was 43.7 years (range: 18 to 71 years); 
and the majority of participants (92.3%) were 19 to <65 years old. Overall, there was an equal 
proportion of males and females (50.0% each). Mean weight, height, and BMI were 79.54kg (range: 47.0 
to 101.0kg). 
Multidose administrations of the top 3 doses of bimekizumab decreased the severity of PsA, as measured 
by increased responder rates for ACR and mPsARC and improvements from Baseline in DAS28(CRP), and 
DAS28(ESR) compared with placebo. The bimekizumab top 3 dose group had consistently larger 
percentages of participants that achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses compared with the 
placebo group at Week 9 and Week 21. The bimekizumab top 3 dose group also had a slightly greater 
mean decrease in DAS28(CRP) and DAS28(ESR) compared with the placebo group and a slightly greater 
mean increase in mPsARC response rate. Mean decreases from Baseline in LEI (ie, improvement) were 
observed over time for all treatment groups; these decreases were similar for the bimekizumab top 3 
dose group and the placebo group. 
Multidose administrations of bimekizumab improved the clinical features of plaque psoriasis, as measured 
by LSS, PASI, and PGAP. The mean percent change from Baseline in the LSS was greater for the 
bimekizumab treatment groups compared with the placebo group. There were also greater percentages of 
PASI50, PASI75, and PASI90 responders and a greater reduction in median PGAP in participants treated 
with bimekizumab compared with those treated with placebo at all post-Baseline assessments.   
PA0008 Phase 2b 
A Phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-ranging study 
to investigate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of bimekizumab compared with placebo in adult study 
participants with active PsA. PA0008 study results were used to guide the selection of doses and clinical 
indices in the Phase 3 development. See Section 2.4.1 of AR for further information.

PA0009 Phase 2b 
A Phase 2b multicenter, OLE study evaluating the long-term (up to 100 weeks [~2 years]) safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab in study participants with PsA who completed PA0008 and were 
eligible to enter PA0009. At Week 48 of PA0008, all eligible study participants continuing into PA0009 
underwent their final PA0008 study assessments and any nonoverlapping PA0009 entry assessments, and 
then received their first open-label dose of bimekizumab. At the conclusion of PA0008, study participants 
were either receiving bimekizumab 160mg Q4W or bimekizumab 320mg Q4W; in PA0009, all study 
participants received bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, regardless of the dose received in PA0008.  
Figure 53: Schematic diagram for PA0009 
Study population disposition and baseline characteristics 
A total of 184 study participants participating in PA0008 were enrolled in PA0009. Of the 183 study 
participants (100%) who started treatment with bimekizumab, 161 study participants (88%) completed 
the study. A total of 22 study participants (12.0%) discontinued the study; reasons for discontinuation 
were AEs and consent withdrawn (not due to AE) (9 study participants [4.9%] each), lack of efficacy (2 
study participants [1.1%]) and lost to follow up and other (1 study participant [0.5%] each). 
Demographics characteristics were generally well balanced across treatment groups (bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W or bimekizumab 320mg Q4W at PA0008 completion). Overall, the Baseline disease 
characteristics in PA0008 were reflective of a population with active PsA.  
The majority of study participants at Baseline in PA0008 had ≥3% PSO BSA (66.7%), and/or nail PSO 
(76.0%). The proportion of study participants at Baseline had enthesitis (52.5%), and/or dactylitis 
(27.3%). The majority of study participants at PA009 Baseline had <3% PSO BSA (92.3%). These results 
were as expected since all study participants had been receiving bimekizumab in PA0008; the improved 
parameters are reflective of efficacy observed during that period.  
At Baseline in PA0009, the majority of study participants were using 1 NSAID therapy (58.5%) and/or 
synthetic DMARDs (62.8%, primarily MTX [58.5%]). 
Overall, 24 study participants (13.1%) in the SS (Safety Set) used a concomitant rescue medication 
during the study. The majority of study participants who received concomitant rescue medication were 
taking NSAIDs at the PA0009 Entry Visit (EV) (13 study participants); of the 11 study participants who 
were not taking NSAIDs at the PA0009 EV, 2 study participants initiated NSAIDs in PA0009 (without COX-
2 inhibitors) and 3 study participants initiated COX-2 inhibitors in PA0009. Nine study participants used 
MTX, and 1 study participant each used sulfasalazine and LEF in PA0009. Two study participants used a 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 160/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
combination of DMARDs. Two study participants received intra-articular corticosteroids. Five study 
participants received oral corticosteroid prednisolone during the study. One participant each started 
analgesics oxycodone and Vicodin. Five study participants received unclassified rescue medications; and 
included triamcinolone acetonide, hydrocortisone butyrate, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, 
amorolfine, zinalfat, and urea. 
Efficacy results  
There was no primary efficacy variable for this study. 
The secondary efficacy variables were the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response at Week 48; change from 
Baseline of PA0008 in MASES at Week 48; change from Baseline of PA0008 in the LDI at Week 48; and 
PASI75 and PASI90 response at Week 48. 
Over the course of ~2 years in the study, participants maintained the substantial improvements in 
efficacy outcomes achieved during PA0008 through all PA0009 visits. This durability of efficacy was 
consistent across all efficacy variables that were assessed, indicating a sustained improvement in PsA 
symptoms in study participants.

Table 66: ACR70 response at PA0009 Week 48 relative to PA0008 Basline (FAS [NRI and OC]) 
PASI response: Due to an error in the original PA0009 protocol schedule of assessments, the 
measurement of PASI in study participants with BSA affected by PSO of ≥3% at PA0008 Baseline was not 
performed as intended at each post-Baseline time point, as the original PA0009 protocol schedule of 
assessments failed to indicate this measurement should have been conducted at all visits. The protocol 
was subsequently updated (Amendment 3) to correct the schedule of assessments such that PASI was 
assessed at all visits for study participants with BSA affected by psoriasis of ≥3% at PA0008 Baseline. 
Thus, the number of study participants with OC data was extremely limited at some time points; 
however, due to the correction in Protocol Amendment 3, data was available for nearly all study 
participants at the Week 104 visit. 
Maintenance of PASI75 response in PA0008 Week 12 responders: In participants who were PASI75 
responders at Week 12 (including participants receiving placebo and bimekizumab 16mg Q4W treatment) 
in PA0008 (57.5%), the PASI75 responder rates in PA0009 relative to PA0008 Baseline were initially high 
(97.1% at PA0009 EV) (NRI). For these study participants, the PASI75 responder rate was maintained at 
78.3% at Week 24 and 84.1% at PA0009 Week 104. 
Maintenance of PASI90 response in PA0008 Week 12 responders: In participants who were PASI90 
responders at Week 12 (including participants receiving placebo and bimekizumab 16mg Q4W treatment) 
in PA0008 (38.3%), the PASI90 responder rates in PA0009 relative to PA0008 Baseline were initially high 
(95.7% at PA0009 EV) (NRI). For these study participants, the PASI90 responder rate was maintained at 
76.1% for Week 24 and 84.8% at PA0009 Week 104. 
PA0012 Phase 3 OLE study 
There is currently no long-term efficacy data from study PA0012, the final CSR is planned to be available 
in Sep 2026 and will be submitted for assessment once available (see RMP). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Bimekizumab is currently approved for plaque psoriasis. This application aims to extend the indication to 
treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The bimekizumab PsA clinical development program consisted of 2 adequate and well-controlled pivotal 
Phase 3 studies designed to provide confirmatory evidence of the safety and efficacy of bimekizumab 
through 52 weeks (PA0010) and 16 weeks (PA0011). In addition, the following supportive studies were 
submitted, PA0007: completed Phase 1 study, PA0008: Completed Phase 2 study and PA0009 its OLE

study, PA0012: Open-label extension study for eligible PA0010 and PA0011 completers, ongoing and 
DV0004: Completed Phase 3, device sub-study within the OLE study PA0012.  
A sufficient number of study participants with active PsA were included in the pivotal Phase 3 studies to 
provide a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of bimekizumab. These studies were 
adequately powered and representative of the targeted patient population that would be indicated for 
bimekizumab treatment in clinical practice. The designs were largely in line with Scientific Advice 
recommendations.  
Bimekizumab was tested against placebo across multiple clinician-reported measures and patient-
reported outcomes in both studies. PA0010 included an active reference arm (adalimumab). Both PA0010 
and PA0011 investigated the effects of bimekizumab on all disease aspects, including joint and skin 
symptoms, peripheral and extra-articular manifestations, physical function and mobility, as well as the 
broader impact on the patients’ ability to conduct their daily activities (including work) and health-related 
quality of life. The efficacy endpoints were comprehensive and representative of PsA disease. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose Rationale 
The recommended dose and dosing regimen tested in the Phase 3 studies of bimekizumab was selected 
based on safety, efficacy, and PK data from the Phase 2b study PA0008 in adult patients with PsA, as well 
as PK/PD modelling in that study (CL0464). While a loading dose was initially considered for faster onset 
of action, it was determined that higher exposures associated with the initial loading dose could result in 
treatment effects at an early timepoint that were not reflective of long-term efficacy of a chronic therapy. 
Further, the loading dose could artificially inflate the response seen at Week 16 or at Week 24, which 
would not be reflective of maintenance response in a chronic disease. Therefore, based on the overall 
data, the recommended posology of bimekizumab is as follows: 
• 
For adult patients with PsA, the recommended dose of bimekizumab is 160mg Q4W. 
The 160mg Q4W dose has been adequately supported. Further rationale has been provided to support the 
recommended dose. 
• 
For adult patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe plaque PSO, the 
recommended dosing regimen of bimekizumab is the same as for PSO - 320 mg (given as 2 
subcutaneous injections of 160 mg each) at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks 
thereafter. 
To support the proposed dose bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for the first 16 weeks and Q8W thereafter, the 
following were provided: 
•  Subgroup analysis of PA0010 and PA0011 of PSO affected % BSA at Baseline, in study 
participants with ≥3 to 10% BSA at Baseline and those with BSA>10% for the bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W group 
•  Pooled efficacy data from Pool E1 
•  Baseline body weight covariate analysis 
•  Combined PK-PD model of the ER relationship between bimekizumab concentrations and PASI 
score. 
•  PK and PK-PD modelling with bimekizumab 320mg Q8W on ACR responses  
•  Clinical and PK/PD modelling results in the PSO development programme 
EMA/235043/2023

The parallels drawn to the endpoints generated in the plaque psoriasis (PSO) development programme 
cannot however be fully supported given the obvious differences of the populations and clinical trial 
settings; however, a lower trend of PASI90 response in the PsA development program is recognised, in 
both the PA0010 and PA0011 subgroup analysis and the pooled efficacy data from Pool E1.  
Overall, during the initial assessment, it was concluded that there was a paucity of clinical data to support 
the efficacy of the 320 mg Q8W maintenance dose in patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to 
severe PSO. The MAH was therefore requested to discuss the benefit-risk of allowing the selection of the 
dose in this cohort to the discretion of the clinician, including possible risk mitigation measures in the 
form of clinician guidance for monitoring ACR and PASI responses/treatment targets. In response, the 
MAH has proposed additional clarification to be added to the proposed posology to give the clinician 
flexibility in the treatment of patients who do not continue to respond optimally to 320mg Q8W for joint 
symptoms in the maintenance phase. Overall, the MAH’s proposal to consider a switch to 160 mg Q4W in 
patients with PsA and concomitant PSO who do not maintain a sufficient response in joints after week 16 
can be accepted. It is agreed with the MAH that the risk of reduced ACR responses is small. The risk is 
acknowledged as more likely in patients with high body weight, with this risk being already mitigated by 
additional posology available for patients with PsA and concomitant PSO and weighing ≥120kg to continue 
dosing with 320mg Q4W after Week 16. In addition, the newly proposed wording supports the general 
PsA treatment goals which aim to reflect patient preferences, with patients being provided with the best 
information concerning relevant options and consideration of all disease domains. The section 4.2 of the 
SmPC was thus updated to reflect that after 16 weeks, regular assessment of efficacy is recommended 
and if a sufficient clinical response in joints cannot be maintained, a switch to 160mg every 4 weeks can 
be considered.  In addition, the subgroup of ‘psoriatic arthritis with coexistent moderate to severe 
psoriasis) and a body weight ≥ 120 kg’ was included under the Special populations, Overweight patient 
subgroup, Posology sub-heading. 
Pivotal trials PA0010 and PA0011 
PA0010 (BE OPTIMAL) and PA0011 (BE COMPLETE) are randomised, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-
group, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study 
participants with active PsA through 52 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The two Phase 3 PsA clinical 
studies share most of the methodological aspects and thus facilitated comparative analysis.  
A total of 1112 study participants with active PsA were randomised to receive either bimekizumab or 
placebo in the Phase 3 studies PA0010 and PA0011. In PA0010, there were an additional 140 study 
participants with PsA randomised to receive adalimumab in the active reference arm. 
Demographic and Baseline characteristics 
Demographic characteristics, PsA-related and other Baseline disease characteristics were generally well 
balanced across treatment groups and reflective of the populations recruited in PA0010 and PA0011 
pivotal studies. 
Overall, these study participant characteristics were appropriate for evaluating the efficacy of 
bimekizumab treatment in the target patient population of active PsA. For both studies, patients had a 
diagnosis of active PsA for at least 6 months based on the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis 
(CASPAR) and had active disease with tender joint count (TJC) ≥3 and swollen joint count (SJC) ≥3.  
Study participants had active disease across multiple domains of PsA including dactylitis, enthesitis, and 
skin and nail disease. Overall, 57.7% of study participants had nail PSO, 12.3% of study participants had 
dactylitis, and approximately one-third had enthesitis (38.6% by SPARCC and 31.9% by LEI). At baseline, 
55.9% of patients had ≥ 3% Body Surface Area (BSA) with active PSO with 10.4% of patients having 
moderate to severe PSO. The patient demographic and baseline characteristics were largely 
representative of the PsA population.

Regarding the concomitant cDMARD therapy in both pivotal trials. There was insufficient representation of 
patients receiving concomitant treatment with cDMARDs other than methotrexate (MTX) in the pivotal 
studies to support B/R assessment in this patient group. In PA0010, at baseline, 58.2% of patients were 
receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), 11.3% were receiving concomitant cDMARDs other than MTX, 
and 30.5% were receiving no cDMARDs. In PA0011, at baseline, 42.5% of patients were receiving 
concomitant MTX, 8.0% were receiving concomitant cDMARDs other than MTX, and 49.5% were receiving 
no cDMARDs. The MAH was therefore requested to justify the benefit-risk of bimekizumab in patients 
receiving concomitant treatment with cDMARDs other than methotrexate, or restrict the indication to “in 
combination with methotrexate”. The MAH agreed to restrict the indication to ‘in combination with 
methotrexate as outlined in the section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
Outcomes/ Results 
PSA0010 and PSA0011 
The primary endpoint and ranked secondary endpoints were evaluated using a fixed-sequence testing 
procedure to account for multiplicity. According to this procedure, the statistical testing of an endpoint 
was investigated only if the null hypothesis for the previous endpoint had been rejected (i.e., if p<0.05).  
Study results for the primary and ranked secondary endpoints across PA0010 and PA0011 consistently 
demonstrated that treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W was superior to treatment with placebo, 
providing robust, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvements for study participants 
with active PsA. 
The primary objective was met in both pivotal studies. In PA0010, Bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment 
demonstrated a superior ACR50 responder rate at Week 16 (the primary efficacy variable) compared with 
the placebo group (43.9% vs 10.0%, respectively). This difference is considered clinically meaningful, 
with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo of 7.082 (p<0.001). In PA0011, treatment with 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W demonstrated a superior ACR50 responder rate at Week 16 (the primary 
efficacy variable) compared with the placebo group (43.4% vs 6.8%, respectively). This difference is also 
considered clinically meaningful, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo of 11.086 
(p<0.001). The results of all supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable confirmed the primary 
efficacy results.  
PA0010 and PA0010 also met all of the ranked secondary efficacy objectives. Ranked Secondary 
endpoints displayed efficacy on the broader aspects of PsA disease. Efficacy was shown in skin symptoms 
(PASI90) and pooled data (PA0010 and PA0011) were included in the sequential testing hierarchy for the 
efficacy variables of enthesitis-free state and dactylitis-free state (based on LEI). Measures of physical 
function (HAQ-DI response and SF 36 PCS scores) and disease activity (MDA) were also significant ranked 
secondary endpoints.  
Structural progression was assessed as part of PA0010 ranked-secondary endpoints. Of the study 
participants with elevated hs-CRP and/or at least 1 bone erosion at Baseline from the Radiographic Set 
(RAS), the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a minimal mean change from Baseline in vdHmTSS, 
whereas the placebo group worsened at Week 16 (0.04 vs 0.36, respectively; p=0.001); this difference 
was statistically significant and indicated inhibition of structural progression after treatment with 
bimekizumab.  
In all study participants from the RAS, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a minimal mean change 
from Baseline in vdHmTSS, whereas the placebo group worsened at Week 16 (0.04 vs 0.32, respectively; 
p=0.001); this difference was statistically significant and indicated inhibition of structural progression. 
There was no evidence of worsening after 4 months of treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 165/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Upon CHMP’s request, further data up to week 52 were provided by the MAH. At Week 52, the mean 
change from Baseline in vdHmTSS for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was 0.10, indicating that the 
inhibition of structural progression observed with bimekizumab treatment was sustained. In study 
participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W at Week 16, the mean change from 
Baseline in vdHmTSS at Week 52 was 0.19. 
Noting that higher vdHmTSS scores indicated greater radiographic damage, no radiographic joint damage 
progression is defined as a change from baseline in mTSS of ≤0.5. 
In general, at Week 16 and Week 52 in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and Placebo/BKZ 160mg 
Q4W group a minimal mean change from Baseline in vdHmTSS was recorded. Change from baseline in 
mTSS of ≤0.5 was reported indicating that there was an inhibition of structural progression observed with 
bimekizumab treatment.  
At Week 16 and Week 52 in the adalimumab group, numerical improvement in vdHmTSS score was 
reported. The mean change from Baseline at Week 16 in vdHmTSS for adalimumab was -0.14 and at 
Week 52 was -0.17.  
Non-ranked secondary endpoints displayed efficacy across signs and symptoms in joints (ACR20/50/70) 
and skin (PASI75/90/100 and IGA 0/1), physical function (HAQ-DI response and SF-36 PCS scores, 
peripheral manifestations (enthesitis-free state, dactylitis-free state, and nail PSO [mNAPSI resolution]), 
axial involvement (BASDAI scores), inflammation (hs-CRP levels), PROs of fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue 
subscale scores), health-related QoL (PsAID-12 response), and social life and work productivity (EQ-5D-
3L and WPAI-SHP). 
Key endpoints are presented in the SmPC section 5.1 with the Pooled E1 data group and support 
treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W for PsA across multiple joint and skin domains.  
In PA0010, study participants treated with bimekizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvement 
across joint symptoms (including ACR20, ACR50, ACR70) that was comparable but numerically lower than 
to adalimumab and was numerically higher for skin symptoms (including PASI75, PASI90, PASI100, and 
IGA response) compared to adalimumab within 16 weeks of treatment. No formal statistical comparisons 
versus adalimumab were conducted. The MAH provided adequate rationale regarding the clinical 
significance of the numerically lower response seen in the PA0010 Bimekizumab 160mg Q4W arm 
compared to the adalimumab arm in the various efficacy endpoints including but not exclusive to the 
primary efficacy endpoint (ACR50 responder rate at Week 16), mean decrease from Baseline in HAQ-DI 
and ACR20/70. The rationale is agreed that comparisons of the adalimumab arm to the bimekizumab arm 
should be interpreted with caution given the study was not powered to make inferential comparisons 
between adalimumab and bimekizumab. Moreover, the sample size ratio of bimekizumab vs adalimumab 
was 3:1, and the numerical treatment differences could be due to variability in the data because of the 
lower number of study participants in the adalimumab arm. In addition, although the responses with 
bimekizumab treatment for several efficacy variables (except for skin-related variables, which were 
numerically higher with bimekizumab) were similar to or slightly numerically lower compared with 
adalimumab treatment at Week 16, long-term Week 52 data demonstrated a slightly higher or similar 
response for bimekizumab on most joint-related endpoints compared with adalimumab including 
ACR20/50/70, maintenance of ACR50, Minimal Disease Activity (MDA), very low disease activity (VLDA), 
and Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) responses. 
Bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment showed improvements in response over time with ACR 20/50/70 
response at Week 2 and 4, maintained up to Week 24 in PA0010 and Week 16 in PA0011. In both PA0010 
and PA0011 the ACR 20/50/70 Week 2 responder rate was higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
compared with the placebo group across key variables with nominally significant p values. Participants 
with PSO involving at least 3% BSA at Baseline in both studies, the PASI75/90/100 responder rate was 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 166/234 
 
 
 
 
  
higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 2 and increased 
through Week 16 and was higher compared with the placebo group at each time point. In the PA0010 
study data (up to Week 52), the PASI75/90/100 responses with bimekizumab treatment continued to 
improve to Week 52.   
Bimekizumab treatment resulted in low disease activity as demonstrated by almost half of the pooled 
Phase 3 study participants treated with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W achieved MDA response at Week 16 
compared with approximately 10% of placebo study participants; this improvement was supported by the 
individual study results that showed statistically significant improvements in MDA response versus 
placebo at Week 16. Clinically meaningful improvements were also observed after bimekizumab 
treatment in several composite efficacy endpoints (ACR50/PASI90, VLDA, ACR50/PASI100 DAPSA, 
PASDAS, and PsARC responses). 
Psoriatic arthritis has a notable effect on a patient’s physical function and health-related outcomes. 
Bimekizumab treatment produced clinically meaningful improvements in disease manifestations such as 
the patients’ perceived PsA-related pain and fatigue, and the impact of this pain and fatigue on their 
ability to function in daily life. This improvement was maintained over time.  
Following treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, the marked improvements compared with placebo 
for both physician- and participant-assessed variables observed in the initial 16-week treatment period 
were sustained through Week 24 (PA0010). 
For both PA0010 and PA0011 subgroup analysis, improvements in ACR50, PASI90, and HAQ-DI responses 
at Week 16 were observed for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group 
across a large number of subgroups that were generally considered clinically meaningful. Clinically 
relevant differences in efficacy response are observed for age and gender in the phase 2 and phase 3 
clinical studies and these might be of relevance to the prescriber. The MAH was therefore requested to 
discuss whether the observed differences in response with regard to age and gender subgroups were to 
be mentioned in the SmPC, which was not considered needed following further discussion. It is agreed 
with the MAH that although lower efficacy in joint outcomes was observed in females and older patients, 
efficacy was observed was still clinically relevant as compared with placebo. In addition, this phenomenon 
is well known in the literature studies with other biologics in PsA. Thus, no update to the SmPC in relation 
to gender or age are warranted.  
Similar improvements in efficacy were observed in study participants irrespective of whether they were 
receiving concomitant cDMARDs (MTX or other cDMARDs) or no cDMARDs. It should be noted that the 
sample sizes for some of the subgroup categories in the analyses were relatively small, and therefore 
interpretation of these data should be made with caution. 
With the submission of updated PA0010 Week 52 data, additional efficacy data collected through the 36-
week, Active Treatment-Blind Period of the completed PA0010 study demonstrated that efficacy outcomes 
achieved at Week 16 with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W either continued to improve or were sustained up to 
1 year (Week 52). 
PA0008 (Dose response study) 
The results indicated dose-proportional PK of bimekizumab between the dose ranges studied (16mg, 
160mg and 320mg), which is consistent with other PK studies of bimekizumab in different populations. 
Steady state was reached between weeks 16-20, which is consistent with bimekizumab half-life of ~28 
days. 
The primary efficacy analysis of the dose response for the primary efficacy variable (ACR50 response at 
Week 12) was evaluated for statistical significance using ordered categorical analysis with a 
corresponding p-value. Based on this procedure, data from PA0008 demonstrated that treatment with 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 167/234 
 
 
 
 
  
bimekizumab across a range of doses (16mg to 320mg) administered Q4W resulted in a statistically 
significant dose response in ACR50 responder rates at Week 12.  
The secondary efficacy analysis of pairwise comparisons between each bimekizumab dose group and 
placebo for the primary efficacy variable (ACR50 response at Week 12) was evaluated for statistical 
significance using a fixed sequence testing procedure from highest dose to lowest dose. Significantly 
better ACR50 responders rates at Week 12 were observed for the bimekizumab 16mg, 160mg, and 
160mg w/LD doses vs placebo. At the highest bimekizumab dose tested, 320mg, a clinically relevant 
difference compared with placebo was observed (24.4% vs 7.1%), although this difference was not 
statistically significant. 
The results of all secondary endpoints were consistent and supported the findings of the primary 
endpoint. All bimekizumab doses were associated with a greater response compared with placebo. A 
significant treatment response was consistently observed for the secondary endpoints in the bimekizumab 
160mg w/LD group that was not observed across all secondary endpoints for the other bimekizumab dose 
groups. Thus, the Phase 3 PsA program utilized bimekizumab 160mg Q4W. 
PA0009 
Overall, the improvement in ACR response, PASI response, BSA, MDA and DAS28(CRP) was similar in 
PA0009 study participants who had received bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg Q4W at 
the completion of PA0008. 
The key secondary endpoints had improvements from PA0008 Baseline observed at PA0008 completion 
that were maintained at Week 48 of PA0009. At Week 48 of PA0009, 79.0% of study participants were 
ACR20 responders (NRI), 64.6% of study participants were ACR50 responders (NRI), and 47.5% of study 
participants were ACR70 responders (NRI). 
In general, other efficacy endpoints had improvements from PA0008 Baseline observed at PA0008 
completion that were maintained through PA0009 visits. The ACR20 responder rates were high at the 
completion of PA0008 and maintained through PA0009 visits: 80.1% at PA0009 EV, 79.0% at Week 48, 
and 72.9% at Week 104 (NRI). 
Approximately two-thirds of the study participants were ACR50 responders at the completion of PA0008 
and this was maintained through PA0009 visits: 63.5% at PA0009 EV, 64.6% at Week 48, and 60.2% at 
Week 104 (NRI). 
Approximately half of the study participants were ACR70 responders at the completion of PA0008 and this 
was maintained through PA0009: 45.3% at PA0009 EV, 47.5% at Week 48, and 44.8% at Week 104 
(NRI). 
Due to an error in the original PA0009 protocol schedule of assessments, the number of study 
participants with PASI OC data was extremely limited at some time points; however due to the correction 
in Protocol Amendment 3, data were available for nearly all study participants at the Week 104 visit. 
The PASI75, PASI190, and PASI100 responder rates were high (88.3%, 80.0%, and 70.8%, respectively) 
at the completion of PA0008. Data for these endpoints was limited at several PA0009 visits. For visits with 
a meaningful sample size of data collected,  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the PASI75, PASI190, and PASI100 responder rates were maintained for:  
PASI75 (NRI) 88.3% at PA0009 EV, 76.7% at Week 24, and 79.2% at Week 104  
PASI90 (NRI) 80.0% at PA0009 EV, 70.8% at Week 24, and 73.3% at Week 104, and  
PASI100 (NRI)70.8% at PA0009 EV, 66.7% at Week 24, and 65.8% at Week 104.  
EMA/235043/2023

Similar results were observed with additional supporting analyses, which were performed using BSA as a 
proxy for PASI response. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In adult study participants with active PsA, the individual study data and integrated analyses demonstrate 
the consistent and clinically meaningful benefits of bimekizumab treatment for the overall study 
population and across all relevant subgroups.  
Overall Bimekizumab demonstrated similar levels of response in both bDMARD naïve (PA0010) and TNFα-
IR (PA0011) patient populations across multiple joint and skin domains. In both pivotal Phase 3 studies, 
participants receiving bimekizumab 160mg Q4W showed significant improvement in signs and symptoms 
of PsA disease within 16 weeks of treatment regardless of whether they were bDMARD-naïve or TNFα-IR.  
The magnitude of improvement was consistent across both populations. Both studies met their primary 
objectives and demonstrated that treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W was superior to placebo in 
statistically significant (p<0.001) and clinically meaningful improvements at Week 16 in signs and 
symptoms of disease activity, as measured by the ACR50 response (primary efficacy variable).  
Both studies also met all of their ranked secondary efficacy objectives; bimekizumab treatment resulted 
in clinically meaningful and statistically superior improvements for all ranked secondary efficacy variables 
in the statistical hierarchies compared with placebo. Additionally, numerically greater improvements 
compared with placebo were observed for the non-ranked secondary efficacy endpoints following 
bimekizumab treatment. The results of all supportive analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy 
variables confirmed the results of the primary analyses, and subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent 
efficacy over placebo at Week 16 across multiple subgroups. 
Across both studies, results demonstrated that bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment for 16 weeks 
resulted in improvements in multiple aspects of PsA disease, including improvement in joint and skin 
symptoms, improvement in multiple disease domains (eg, physical function and peripheral disease 
manifestations), low disease activity, and improvement in patient-reported outcomes of fatigue, HRQoL, 
and social life and work productivity Inhibition of structural damage in a bDMARD-naïve population was 
also shown (vdHmTSS assessment) in PA0010. Updated PA0010 Week 52 efficacy data demonstrated 
that efficacy outcomes achieved at Week 16 either continued to improve or were sustained up to 1 year 
(Week 52). 
The development program supports the proposed posology of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W in patients with 
active PsA. In patients with active PsA who have moderate to severe plaque PSO, the proposed posology 
of bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for the first 16 weeks and Q8W thereafter is agreed. Nevertheless, to give 
the clinician flexibility in the treatment of patients with PsA and concomitant PSO who may not respond 
optimally to 320mg Q8W for joint symptoms in the maintenance phase, a switch to 160 Q4W in such 
patients has been accepted.  
Given that the majority of subjects enrolled were taking MTX as their cDMARD and there was insufficient 
representation of patients receiving concomitant treatment with other csDMARDs, the indication has been 
updated to be restricted to “in combination with methotrexate”.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety Datasets 
The following integrated datasets were submitted to support the safety for the current application. The 
safety analysis for the bimekizumab PsA program included a review of safety data from 3 integrated 
safety pools (SP1, SP2, and S3) and from non-pooled studies (including studies in other indications). 
Pool SP1 
Pool SP1, the primary safety pool, compares bimekizumab 160mg (n=698) every 4 weeks (Q4W) with 
placebo (N=413) through Week 16 in 2 Phase 3 studies conducted in the PsA population. Combined data 
from the Initial Treatment Periods of PA0010 and PA0011 through Week 16 were included in this analysis.  
Pool SP2 
Pool SP2 summarises the safety of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W over extended dosing, including during 
open-label periods, in 2 Phase 2 and 3 Phase 3 studies (including 2 ongoing studies) conducted in the PsA 
population. This includes combined data from PA0010, and PA0011 and OLE study PA0012 from Initial 
Treatment Period, Maintenance Treatment Period, and OLE Treatment Period available at the time of the 
clinical data. In the initial application the interim analysis for Study PA0010 included all safety data 
available at the time of the Week 24 data cut (25 October 2021). At the Week 24 data cut, 75% of study 
participants in PA0010 had reached Week 52. Data from PA0012 through the cut-off date of 04 January 
2022 were included.  
Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided a Safety Update including all safety data from completed 
Phase 3 studies PA0010 (database lock 27 July 2022), and PA0011 (database lock 04 March 2022), along 
with all safety data entered into the OLE study PA0012 database as of the designated clinical cut-off date 
(20 May 2022). This Safety Update combined these Phase 3 data with the data from Phase 2 studies 
PA0008 and PA0009.  
Pool S3 
A safety Pool S3 consisted of combined data through Week 16 (i.e., the Initial Treatment Period) across 
indications in development for Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in rheumatology (PsA [PA0010 and 
PA0011] and axial spondylarthritis [axSpA; AS0010 and AS0011]) and dermatology (psoriasis [PSO; 
PS0009 and PS0013]) to support the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to bimekizumab.

Table 67: Overview of safety pools 
The bimekizumab PsA program also included 1 device presentation study (DV0004). This compared the 
safe and effective use of the bimekizumab-SS-1mL (safety syringe) or the bimekizumab-AI 
(autoinjector)-1mL for the SC self-injection of bimekizumab solution by adult study participants with PsA 
and was conducted as a sub study (in North America and Europe) of the ongoing OLE study PA0012.

Reference is made to the efficacy section for a summary of demographics and disease characteristics of 
the studied PsA population. 
Previous or ongoing medical history and concomitant medications 
In Pool SP1, the majority of study participants (88.4% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 88.1% 
in the placebo group) reported a previous or ongoing medical condition at Baseline. The most frequently 
reported conditions/diseases at Baseline in the ‘all study’ participants group were in the SOCs of 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders (54.3%), Vascular disorders (41.9%), and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (38.0%). Overall, the most frequently reported medical history conditions at 
Baseline were hypertension (37.9%), obesity (35.9%), and osteoarthritis (14.2%). The incidences of 
previous or ongoing medical history conditions at Baseline by PT were generally similar across groups 
apart from Blood and lymphatic system disorders (7.5% vs 4.9%) which were slightly higher in the 
placebo group compared with the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and Metabolism and nutrition

disorders (51.8% vs 55.7%) and Psychiatric disorders (15.0% vs 18.2%) which were slightly lower in the 
placebo group compared with the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group.  
Extra-articular medical history: Dactylitis (47.2% vs 43.6%) was slightly higher in the placebo group 
compared with the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. A total of 12 study participants had prior or ongoing 
IBD; the incidence was similar in the 2 treatment groups (1.0% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
and 1.2% in the placebo group).  
In Pool SP2 89.6% in the bimekizumab Total group reported a previous or ongoing medical condition at 
Baseline. The most frequently reported conditions/diseases at Baseline in the bimekizumab Total group 
were in the SOCs of Metabolism and nutrition disorders (52.3%), Vascular disorders (42.1%), and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (38.8%). 
The most frequently reported medical history conditions at Baseline in the bimekizumab Total group were 
hypertension (38.1%), obesity (32.1%), and osteoarthritis (14.2%). 
Extra-articular medical history: Dactylitis was reported by 45.5% of study participants in the 
bimekizumab Total group as a prior or ongoing condition. A total of 14 study participants (1.0%) had 
prior or ongoing IBD; however, for 1 of these participants, IBD was reported in error. 
In Pool SP1 (98.3% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 97.6% in the placebo group) reported 
use of concomitant medications. 59.7% of patients in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and 58.1% in the 
placebo group had used antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents including methotrexate and 
immunosuppressants for PsA. 
In Pool SP2 98.8% reported use of prior medications. Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents were 
used by 61.9% of the BKZ total population. 
The demographic and Baseline characteristics of Pool SP2 in the Safety Update were similar to those in 
the original submission. 
Patient exposure 
Overall, in the PsA clinical development program, 698 study participants in the primary safety Pool SP1 
and 1413 study participants in the more comprehensive updated Pool SP2 were exposed to bimekizumab 
with total times at risk accounting for 218.7 and 2664.0 participant-years, respectively. As of the  
updated clinical cut-off date, study medication exposures of at least 12 months were achieved by 968, 
1143, and 1147 study participants in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W, Phase 2/3 bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W, and bimekizumab Total groups, respectively.

Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period, TEAEs were reported in 
77.2% (EAIR: 143.5/100 participant-years) study participants. Treatment-emergent AEs in the 
bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations 
(52.5%), Gastrointestinal disorders (20.8%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (17.8%), 
and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (16.8%). Of the commonly reported TEAEs in Pool SP2, the 
most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were nasopharyngitis (11.4%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(8.9%), corona virus infection (7.0%), and oral candidiasis and urinary tract infection (6.7% each). 
Pool SP2 Safety Update 
TEAEs were reported for 83.8% (EAIR: 141.5/100 participant-years) of study participants. Treatment-
emergent AEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections 
and infestations (60.4%), Gastrointestinal disorders (22.9%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (20.7%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (19.5%). Of the commonly reported 
TEAEs in Pool SP2, the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were corona virus infection (14.2%),

for the combined Initial and Maintenance Treatment Periods (Pool SP2) 
Pool SP2 Safety Update 
Longer exposure to bimekizumab was associated with an increase incidence of TEAEs and SAEs from 
week 52. The incidence of TEAEs and SAEs during 16-week intervals over the duration of the studies up 
to week 52 were similar to the original safety analysis. From week 52 there is an increase in incidence of 
TEAEs and SAEs. For the Total BZK population TEAE Onset by time period was as follows:  >0-<=16 
weeks n= 693 (49.0%); >16-<=32 weeks n=607 (43.7%) vs >32-<=48 weeks n= 521 (39.4%) >48 
weeks n=748 (62.7%).  Similar pattern was seen for Any Serious TEAE n= 27 (1.9%) vs n= 34 (2.4%) 
vs n=27 (2.0%) vs n= 78 vs (6.5%) for the same 16 week time intervals. 
TEAEs by timing of onset relative to the COVID-19 pandemic 
Pooled analyses of TEAEs by timing of onset relative to the COVID-19 pandemic (defined as having 
started on 11 March 2020 and continuing until the official declared end of the pandemic) were performed 
to evaluate the eventual impact of the pandemic on the reported safety profile.  
In Pool SP1, for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the EAIRs were higher for TEAEs with onset prior to 
(274.3/100 participant-years) than during (219.4/100 participant-years) the pandemic. For the placebo 
group, the EAIRs were lower for TEAEs with onset prior to (189.5/100 participant-years) than during 
(217.1/100 participant-years) the pandemic. 
In Pool SP2, EAIRs were higher for TEAEs with onset prior to (193.1/100 participant-years) than during 
(121.2/100 participant-years) the pandemic. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 180/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In Pool SP1, the EAIRs for the SOC Infections and infestations were lower during the pandemic (45.7/100 
participant-years in the placebo group and 73.4/100 participant/years in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group) than prior to it (80.9/100 participant-years in the placebo group and EAIR 129.9/100 
participant/years in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group).  
– The highest imbalance at the HLT level was in the HLT Upper respiratory tract infections, with an EAIR 
of 73.5 prior to the pandemic compared with 27.2 during the pandemic in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group.  
− For the majority of PTs within this SOC, with the exception of oral candidiasis, the incidences and EAIRs 
rates tend to be lower during the pandemic than prior to it in both treatment groups. 
For Pool SP2, for the SOC Infections and infestations, in the bimekizumab Total group the EAIRs were 
lower during the pandemic (49.9/100 participant-years) than prior to the pandemic (86.7/100 
participant-years). 
− The highest imbalance at the HLT level was in the HLT Upper respiratory tract infections, with an EAIR 
of 41.0 prior to the pandemic compared with 15.4 during the pandemic in the bimekizumab Total group. 
− For the majority of PTs within this SOC, with the exception of oral candidiasis, the incidences and EAIRs 
rates tend to be lower during the pandemic then prior to it. 
Overview of TEAEs by COVID-19 period SP2 safety update 
The EAIR was higher for TEAEs with onset prior to (272.8/100 participant-years) than during (125.0/100 
participant-years) the pandemic. On a SOC level, the most notable difference occurred within the SOC of 
Infections and infestations, with the highest imbalances for the HLT of Upper respiratory tract infections. 
For Pool SP2 in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, for the SOC of Infections and infestations, 
the EAIRs were lower during the pandemic (53.5/100 participant-years) than prior to the pandemic 
(129.8/100 participant-years). 
− The highest imbalance at the HLT level was in the HLT of Upper respiratory tract infections, with an 
EAIR of 67.7/100 participant-years prior to the pandemic compared with 16.2/100 participant-years 
during the pandemic in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. 
− For the majority of PTs within this SOC, the incidences and EAIRs tended to be lower during the 
pandemic than prior to it. 
COVID-19 infections 
The incidence of TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection were similar in the placebo (1.5% EAIR: 
4.7/100 participant-years) and bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (0.7% EAIR: 2.3/100 participant-years) groups 
in Pool SP1.  
In Pool SP2 the incidence of TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection was 7.5% (EAIR: 4.9/100 
participant-years) in the bimekizumab Total group reflecting the increased prevalence of COVID-19 
infection over time during the conduct of these studies.  
There were no serious TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection in Pool SP1. 
The incidence of serious TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection in the bimekizumab Total group in 
Pool SP2 was 0.4% (EAIR: 0.3/100 participant-years). None of the serious TEAEs were considered to be 
related to study medication. Two other serious TEAEs attributed to COVID-19 were identified following 
manual review of COVID terms. In Pool SP1, 1 study participant reported a serious TEAE of pneumonia 
(verbatim term: COVID-pneumonia confirmed); this participant was also included in Pool SP2. In Pool 
SP2, 1 participant had a serious TEAE that was uncoded at the time of data cut (verbatim term: acute 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 181/234 
 
 
 
 
  
respiratory failure due to severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 infection). None of the serious 
TEAEs were fatal or considered to be related to study medication. All but 1 were reported as 
recovered/resolved at the time of data cut; 1 was reported as recovering. 
Of the 8 serious TEAEs of corona virus infection and those attributed to COVID-19 but having a different 
PT, all occurred in study participants who were unvaccinated (data on file). No COVID-19 infections 
resulted in study discontinuation. 
In addition, during the course of the PsA studies, vaccinations for COVID-19 became available. The 
incidence of COVID-19 vaccinations was higher in Pool SP2 than in Pool SP1; this reflects the increased 
availability of COVID-19 vaccinations over time during the conduct of these studies. 
Pool SP2 safety update 
The incidence of TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection was 14.2% (EAIR: 8.0/100 participant-years) 
in the bimekizumab Total group in Pool SP2. One additional serious TEAE with the PT of corona virus 
infection was reported; the event was resolved and did not lead to discontinuation. The incidence of 
serious TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection in the bimekizumab Total group in Pool SP2 was 0.5% 
(EAIR: 0.3/100 participant-years). 
Severity 
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity in Pool SP1 and Pool SP2. 
In Pool SP1, the incidence of severe TEAEs was 1.3%; (EAIR 4.1/100 participant-years) in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0% in the placebo group. No severe TEAEs, by PT, were reported by 
>1 study participant (0.1%). The severe TEAEs reported for the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were 
neutropenia, stomatitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, limb injury, back pain, toxic encephalopathy, headache, 
renal pain, and pruritus. None of the severe TEAEs led to discontinuation. 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of severe TEAEs was 6.0% (EAIR 3.9/100 participant-years) in the 
bimekizumab Total group. Severe TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported 
in the SOC of infections and infestations (1.1%). A total of 10 severe TEAEs were reported by more than 
1 study participant in the bimekizumab Total group. These TEAEs include corona virus infection (0.2%), 
osteoarthritis (0.2%), acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (2 cases, 0.1% each), and 
neutropenia, herpes zoster, pneumonia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase 
increased, and arthralgia (2 cases, 0.1% each); twelve of the severe TEAEs led to discontinuation.  
Pool SP2 Safety Update 
The majority of TEAEs in Pool SP2 were mild or moderate in intensity. The incidence of severe TEAEs in 
this Safety Update Pool SP2 was 6.5% (EAIR 3.6/100 participant-years) in the bimekizumab Total group. 
Severe TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOC of infections and 
infestations (1.1%).  
Relatedness 
In Pool SP1 the incidence of drug related TEAEs (as assessed by the Investigator) was higher in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (19.5%) compared with the placebo group (9.4%). The most commonly 
reported drug related TEAE was oral candidiasis which was only reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group (2.0%). The other frequently reported drug related TEAEs reported in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group were upper respiratory tract infection (1.6%) and nasopharyngitis (1.4%); the incidences of 
these events were similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and the placebo groups. 
In Pool SP2, 34.0% in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group reported at least 1 TEAE which was 
considered drug-related by the Investigator. A total of 14 drug-related TEAEs by PT were reported in at 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 182/234 
 
 
 
 
  
least 1% of study participants in the bimekizumab Total group; the most commonly reported drug-related 
TEAEs in this group were oral candidiasis (5.4%), nasopharyngitis (2.6%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (2.5%), and oral fungal infection (2.4%). 
Pool SP2 Safety Update 
The Safety Update data showed similar trends to the original submission data; the EAIR for any related 
TEAE in the bimekizumab Total group was 27.3/100 participant-years compared with 29.6/100 
participant-years in the original submission. In Safety Update Pool SP2, approximately one-third of the 
study participants (36.9%) in the bimekizumab Total group reported at least 1 TEAE which was 
considered drug related by the Investigator. The most commonly reported drug-related TEAE in this 
group was oral candidiasis (6.1%) 
Adverse events for labelling 
Determination of ADRs for labelling 
A medical review of TEAEs from Pool S3 (Overall - Phase 3 16-week placebo-controlled period in PsA, 
axSpA, and PSO) and Pool SP1 (Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in PsA) was performed in accordance 
with the strategy described below: 
• TEAEs from Pool S3 with a reported incidence ≥1% higher in the bimekizumab Total group compared 
with placebo. 
• TEAEs from Pool S3, which do not meet the threshold of ≥1% over placebo at PT level but at HLT level 
show a ≥1% higher incidence over placebo (considering synonyms and related group terms). 
• TEAEs that are >1% higher than placebo in Pool SP1 that are biologically plausible based on mechanism 
of action and upon medical review are considered causally related (i.e., ADRs to bimekizumab). 
Table 75: TEAEs with an incidence in the bimekizumab Total group of at least 1% higher than 
the placebo group during the Initial Treatment Period overall (Pool S3) 
The AEs that occurred at least 1% more frequently in the bimekizumab Total group than in the placebo 
group, based on Pool S3, which included the 16-week, placebo-controlled data across the indications of 
PSO, PsA and axSpA have been previously identified as ADRs to bimekizumab based on 16-week, 
placebo-controlled data for the indication of moderate to severe PSO. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 183/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Treatment-emergent AEs identified for medical review as possible ADRs from Pool SP1 
Leukopenia, stomatitis, bronchitis, oropharyngeal pain and pruritus all occurred with an incidence in the 
bimekizumab group of at least 1% higher than in the placebo group during the Initial Treatment Period. 
These were not added as ADRs due to overlap with terms already considered ADRs or evidence for lack of 
a reasonable causal association with bimekizumab. Based on medical review of the Safety Update data, 
there are no additional events considered as adverse drug reactions by UCB in addition to those 
presented in the original submission.      
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Three study participants, all treated with bimekizumab, experienced a TEAE with fatal outcome in the 
bimekizumab development program for PsA. All TEAEs with a fatal outcome were reviewed for 
adjudication by the CV-CAC and the Neuropsychiatric Adjudication Committee. None of these events were 
considered related to bimekizumab per the investigator. 
Table 76: PsA study participants with fatal TEAEs 
There were no additional deaths in the Safety Update data. 
Serious Adverse events 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, incidences of serious TEAEs were 1.7% (n=12) (EAIR: 5.5/100 participant-years) in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.7% (n=3) in the placebo group during the Initial Treatment 
Period. By PT, 2 serious TEAEs were reported by >1 study participant in the bimekizumab Total group: 
pneumonia and joint injury (0.3%; EAIR 0.9/100 participant-years each) and no participants in the 
placebo group. All other serious TEAEs by PT were reported by 1 study participant in any treatment 
group.

liver injury was reported by 2 participants (0.1%; EAIR 0.1/100 participant-years). 
Pool SP2 Safety update 
For Pool SP2, the incidence of serious TEAEs was 10.5% in the bimekizumab Total group. There was no 
notable increase in EAIRs with longer duration of exposure (EAIR: 5.9/100 participant-years in the Safety 
Update vs 6.0/100 participant-years in the original submission [bimekizumab Total group]). 
Serious TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections 
and infestations (2.1%); Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.3%); and Injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications (1.2%). The most common serious TEAEs by PT in the bimekizumab Total

Infections 
In the PsA development program, the vast majority of reported infections were nonserious, mild to 
moderate, rarely led to drug discontinuation, and were consistent with the type of infections observed in 
the Phase 3 PSO studies. The most frequently reported infections in the PsA development program were 
upper respiratory tract infection and oral candidiasis. There were no study discontinuations due to COVID-
19 infections.

Serious Infections 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, the incidence of serious infections was 0.4% EAIR: 1.4/100 participant-years in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group. Three serious infections were reported: pneumonia (2 study 
participants [0.3%]) and bronchitis (1 study participant [0.1%]). Both TEAEs of pneumonia were resolved 
and the TEAE of bronchitis was reported as resolving. No study participant reported serious infections 
while receiving placebo. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of serious infections was 1.9%; EAIR: 1.2/100 participant-years in the 
bimekizumab Total group. The majority of serious infections by HLT in the bimekizumab Total group were 
reported by 1 study participant each, except for Viral infections not elsewhere classified (NEC) (all Corona 
virus infection) in 6 study participants (0.4%), Lower respiratory tract infections and Urinary tract 
infections in 4 study participants (0.3%) each, Bacterial infections NEC and Upper respiratory tract 
infections in 3 study participants (0.2%) each, and Ear infections in 2 study participants (0.1%). 
A total of 26 study participants in the bimekizumab Total group had serious infections; subsequently, the 
following actions were taken with the study drug. Study drug was withdrawn in 5 study participants with 
TEAEs of cellulitis (2 study participants) and hepatitis E, otitis media acute, and postoperative wound 
infection (1 study participant each). Study drug was temporarily interrupted in 15 study participants and 
was re-introduced in 14 study participants after TEAEs of otitis media chronic, chronic sinusitis, renal cyst 
infection, pneumonia (2 study participants), gangrene, corona virus infection (5 study participants), 
upper respiratory tract infection (2 study participants), and oropharyngeal candidiasis, with no recurrence 
of serious infections. 
Pool SP2 Safety Update 
The incidence of serious infections in the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period was 
2.1% EAIR 1.1/100 participant-years in the bimekizumab Total group. A total of 4 additional serious 
infections (cellulitis, pyelonephritis, pyelonephritis acute, and corona virus infection) were reported; 1 
TEAE (pyelonephritis) was considered related to study drug, 1 TEAE (cellulitis) led to discontinuation, and 
all 4 TEAEs were resolved. 
In the Adalimumab group in PA0010, one study participant reported two serious infections herpes zoster 
and atypical pneumonia. The EAIR for serious infection in the adalimumab active reference population in 
PA0010 was 1.44/100PYs. 
Opportunistic infections (including TB) 
Opportunistic infections 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, no opportunistic infection was reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group or placebo 
group. No systemic opportunistic infections were reported and no study participant in Pool SP1 developed 
active TB. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of any opportunistic infection in the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period was low overall (1.2%; EAIR: 0.8/100 participant-years in the bimekizumab Total 
group). Opportunistic infections reported in Pool SP2 in the bimekizumab Total group were a total of 10 
cases of oesophageal candidiasis and fungal oesophagitis (0.4% (5 cases) each), and oropharyngeal 
candidiasis (4 cases 0.3%). All other opportunistic infections were reported by <0.1% of the study 
EMA/235043/2023

participants. No systemic opportunistic infections were reported. The incidence of opportunistic infections 
was similar for the active reference drug (0.7%; EAIR: 0.72/100 participant-years in the adalimumab 
group) in PA0010. 
Updated Pool SP2 
In the updated Pool SP2, the incidence of any opportunistic infection in the combined Initial, Maintenance, 
and OLE Treatment Period was low overall (1.3%; EAIR: 0.7/100 participant-years in the bimekizumab 
Total group). 
Fungal infections 
Incidences of fungal infections were higher in the bimekizumab-treated study participants compared with 
placebo, mainly driven by oral candidiasis infections. No systemic Candida infections were observed in the 
PsA program. 
Pool SP1 
The incidence of any fungal infection was higher in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (4.6%; EAIR 
15/100PY) compared with the placebo group (1.0%; EAIR 3.1/100PY). By HLT, Candida infections were 
reported by 2.6% of participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.5% of participants in the 
placebo group. The HLT Fungal infections NEC was reported by 1.9% of study participants in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.5% of study participants in the placebo group. By PT, the only 
fungal infection TEAE reported with an incidence of ≥1% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was oral 
candidiasis (2.3%). 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of any fungal infection in the bimekizumab Total group (which includes 
participants on higher doses of bimekizumab) was 14.2% (EAIR: 10.0/100 participant-years). Oral 
candidiasis (6.7%) and oral fungal infection (2.7%) were reported with an incidence ≥2% in the 
bimekizumab Total group. 12/199 subjects with any fungal infection discontinued the study due to fungal 
infections, including oral candidiasis (7 study participants), oral fungal infection (2 study participants), 
and skin candida, tongue fungal infection, and gastrointestinal fungal infection (1 study participant each). 
One study participant had a serious fungal infection (oropharyngeal candidiasis). The incidence of any 
fungal infection was lower for the active reference drug (1.4%; EAIR: 1.49/100 participant-years in the 
adalimumab group) in PA0010. 
Updated Pool SP2 
The incidence of any fungal infection in the bimekizumab Total group was 15.7%. The EAIR (9.4/100 
participant-years) did not increase compared to the original submission (10.0/100 participant-years). By 
PT, oral candidiasis (7.5%) and oral fungal infection (2.8%) were reported with an incidence ≥2% in the 
bimekizumab Total group. 
Two additional study participants discontinued the study due to fungal infections (PTs: oral candidiasis 
and fungal skin infection. No additional serious fungal infections were reported. 
Malignancies 
Pool SP1 
Pool SP1, incidences of malignant tumor TEAEs were 0.1%; EAIR: 0.5/100 participant-years in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.5%; EAIR: 1.6/100 participant-years in the placebo group. None 
of the reports of malignancy were assessed as related. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 189/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Pool SP2  
In Pool SP2 the incidence for the bimekizumab Total group was (1.0%; EAIR: 0.6/100 participant-years).  
A total of 14 malignancies (malignant melanoma in situ, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia stage 0, colon 
cancer, basal cell carcinoma (4 cases), breast cancer, ovarian neoplasm, uterine cancer, papillary thyroid 
cancer (2 events in 1 study participant were reported due to 2 hospitalisations), endometrial cancer stage 
I) were reported by 12 study participants. All malignant tumor TEAEs were reported by 1 study 
participant each (<0.1%; EAIR: 0.0/100 participant-years) except for basal cell carcinoma (4 study 
participants [0.3%]; EAIR: 0.2/100 participant-years). Two were judged as related to study treatment by 
the Investigator: malignant melanoma in situ and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia stage 0. No 
malignancies were reported for the active reference drug (adalimumab) in PA0010. 
Pool SP2 Updated 
The incidence of malignant tumor TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group was 1.5%; EAIR: 0.8/100 
participant-years). This is higher than the EAIR in the original submission (0.6/100 participant-years). A 
total of 6 additional malignancy TEAEs (gastric cancer recurrent, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, ovarian 
cancer, prostate cancer, bone giant cell tumour, and renal neoplasm) were reported; 1 TEAE (ovarian 
cancer) was considered related to study drug, all 6 TEAEs were considered serious, and all TEAEs led to 
study discontinuation with the exception of bone giant cell tumour. 
MACE 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, no adjudicated MACE was reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W or placebo groups. The 
incidence of any extended MACE in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was 0.1% (1 study participant 
with a serious event of cardiac failure congestive). No extended MACE was reported in the placebo group. 
The incidence of any adjudicated cardiovascular event was similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
(0.6%) and placebo (0.7%) groups. The majority of these events were resolved at the time of data cut. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, adjudicated MACE were reported for 9 (0.6%) study participants EAIR 0.4/100PYs (Acute 
myocardial infarction 2 cases (1 with fatal outcome), myocardial infarction 1 case, sudden death, 
ischaemic stroke 2 cases, cerebral haemorrhage 1 case, cerebrovascular accident, and thrombotic 
cerebral infarction). One additional event of ischemic stroke was adjudicated as MACE only after the data 
cut due to a change in the reported term by the study site. Extended MACE occurred in 13 study 
participants EAIR 0.6/100PYs in the bimekizumab group. All events were serious and 9 were severe. 
Pool SP2 updated 
The incidence of adjudicated MACE was 0.7% in the SP2 updated safety analysis. The EAIR was the same 
as the original submission (0.4/100 participant-years). One additional participant experienced an 
adjudicated MACE (PT: ischemic stroke). This event was reported in a study participant with a significant 
medical history, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, recurrent 
transient ischemic attacks, and critical symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The event was serious, 
severe, assessed as not drug related by the Investigator, did not lead to study discontinuation, and 
resolved at time of data cut. 
One additional participant experienced extended MACE (PTs: cardiac failure congestive and hypoxia) 
adjudicated as hospitalisation for heart failure. This event was reported in a 72-year-old female with past 
medical history of hypertension (data on file). The PT of cardiac failure congestive was serious, severe, 
assessed as not drug-related by the Investigator, did not lead to study discontinuation, and had not

resolved at the time of the data cut. The PT of hypoxia was not serious, mild, assessed as not drug 
related by the Investigator, and the outcome was unknown at the time of reporting. 
Neutropenia 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs reported was 1.3% and 0.2% in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group and placebo group, respectively. None of the reported neutropenia TEAEs were serious. One 
TEAE of neutropenia was severe, considered related to study drug by the Investigator, led to interruption 
of study drug, and recovered/resolved at the time of data cut. Four TEAEs of neutropenia were mild or 
moderate in intensity and considered related to study drug (by the Investigator). The majority of the 
neutropenia TEAEs (90.0%) were resolved at the time of data cut. Five study participants (0.7%) in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 1 study participant (0.2%) in the placebo group had a TEMA 
neutrophils low count (<1.0x109/L). No study participant had Grade 4 neutrophil reduction. All Gr3 values 
returned to normal. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group was low (2.4%; EAIR: 
1.5/100 PYs). The majority of the neutropenia cases were transient. None were associated with serious 
infections. No neutropenia event was serious. The majority were mild or moderate in intensity except for 
2 TEAEs of neutropenia (by PT) that were considered severe. One resolved, the other resulted in study 
discontinuation. The majority of cases were assessed as drug related. The majority of the neutropenia 
TEAEs (86 %) were resolved at the time of data cut. 
Thirty study participants (2.1%) in the bimekizumab Total group had a TEMA neutrophils low count (< 1 
x109/L). Twenty-three of these 30 study participants had Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil values which 
were transient and had resolved at the data cut. Seven were ongoing. No TEMA neutrophil counts were 
associated with serious infections. PTs of upper respiratory tract infection (3 total events; 2 events in the 
same study participant), laryngitis, nasopharyngitis (4 events), oral herpes, and pneumonia were 
reported within 30 days of a Gr3 or 4 neutrophil value. 
Pool SP2 updated 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of neutropenia was 2.5%; EAIR: 1.4/100 participant-years compared with the 
original submission (2.4%; EAIR: 1.5/100 participant-years). In Pool SP2, 6 additional study participants 
in the bimekizumab Total group had a TEMA neutrophils low count. All 6 of these study participants had 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil values which were transient, and values returned to normal at subsequent 
visits. None of the neutropenia events were associated with serious infections or led to discontinuation 
SIB 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, no TEAEs were adjudicated as SIB by the Neuropsychiatric Adjudication Committee. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, one TEAE in the bimekizumab Total group was adjudicated as SIB by the Neuropsychiatric 
Adjudication Committee. The event of suicidal behaviour in the bimekizumab-treated study participant 
was reported as serious, moderate in intensity, considered not drug-related (as assessed by the 
Investigator), resolved at the time of data cut, and led to study discontinuation. The participant had prior 
history of depression and anxiety and was reportedly noncompliant with her anxiety/depression 
medications prior to the event. No completed suicides were observed in the PsA program. No adjudicated 
SIB was reported for the active reference drug (adalimumab) in PA0010. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 191/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Pool SP2 updated 
The incidence of adjudicated SIB in Pool SP2 was 0.1%; EAIR: 0.1/100 participant-years) compared with 
the original submission (<0.1%; EAIR: 0.0/100 participant-years). One additional TEAE in the 
bimekizumab Total group was adjudicated as SIB by the Neuropsychiatric Adjudication Committee. The 
event of psychiatric evaluation abnormal in the bimekizumab-treated study participant was reported as 
severe in intensity, considered not drug related (as assessed by the Investigator), not resolved at the 
time of data cut off, and led to withdrawal of study drug. This event was reported in a study participant 
with past medical history of anxiety and depression with noncompliance to medications. No completed 
suicides were observed in the PsA program. 
Inflammatory bowel disease 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, no study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group or placebo group reported a 
TEAE that was adjudicated as IBD. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, definite or probably adjudicated IBD TEAEs occurred in 7 study participants (0.5%; EAIR 
0.3/100 participant-years). Definite adjudicated IBD events occurred in 3 study participants (0.2%; EAIR: 
0.1/100 participant-years). Three study participants (4 events) reported TEAEs of colitis ulcerative, 
enteritis, IBD, and colitis microscopic. The TEAE of colitis ulcerative was mild in intensity, considered 
related to study drug (as assessed by the Investigator), and recovered/resolved at the time of data cut. 
All other TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and not considered as related to study drug with the 
exception of enteritis, which was severe and considered as not related to study drug.  
Probable adjudicated IBD events occurred in 4 study participants (0.3%; EAIR: 0.2/100 participant-
years). Three study participants reported TEAEs of diarrhoea and 1 study participant reported a TEAE of 
colitis. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, did not lead to study discontinuation, and 
recovered/resolved at the time of data cut. All TEAEs were considered not related to study drug (as 
assessed by the Investigator), except for 1 event of diarrhoea. 
Possible adjudicated IBD events occurred in 10 study participants (0.7%; EAIR: 0.5/100 participant-
years). Seven participants reported diarrhoea and 1 participant reported each of the following: anal 
fistula, enteritis, colitis, and abdominal pain. Three participants (0.2%) had symptoms not consistent with 
IBD and 1 participant (<0.1%) had an event with not enough information to adjudicate. 
Of the 14 study participants with a history of prior or ongoing IBD, only 1 participant had an event during 
the study which was adjudicated as definite or probable IBD (one participant TEAE of colitis ulcerative).  
The remaining 6 definite or probable cases (UC [1 participant], Crohn’s disease [1 participant], 
microscopic colitis [1 participant], IBD no further differentiation [3 participants]) represent instances of 
new onset/de novo IBD cases. In only 1 of the 7 cases was study drug withdrawn due to the event; in the 
remaining 6 cases, the study drug was continued, and the participants all completed their respective 
studies with no subsequent flares. 
The event outcome for all events except 1 were reported as recovered; the event of inflammatory bowel 
disease in one participant was considered ongoing at the time of the report. 
Pool SP2 updated 
No additional definite or probable IBD cases were reported.

Hypersensitivity 
Anaphylactic reactions 
No anaphylactic reactions were reported in Pool SP1 or Pool SP2 (original submission and Safety Update).  
Other hypersensitivity reactions 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, any hypersensitivity reaction was reported in 3.6% (EAIR 11.7/100PYs) of bimekizumab 
treated study participants compared to 1.7% of placebo treated participants (EAIR 5.5/100PYs). The most 
frequently reported PT terms identified by the MedDRA SMQ narrow search for hypersensitivity belonged 
to the HLT Dermatitis and eczema (and included eczema (0.6%), dermatitis (0.4%) and dermatitis 
allergic (0.3%). None were considered serious. 12 TEAEs were considered drug-related (injection site 
rash, toxic skin eruption, dermatitis [2 study participants], urticarias, gingival swelling [2 study 
participants], rash, swelling face, rash macular, dermatitis allergic, and dermatitis acneiform). One study 
participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group discontinued due to toxic skin eruption, which was 
moderate in intensity, considered related by the Investigator, and resolved on treatment with 
antihistaminic medication. The majority of these potential hypersensitivity reactions (75.9%) were 
resolved at the time of this analysis. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of hypersensitivity (PT terms identified as potential hypersensitivity reactions 
by MedDRA SMQ narrow search for hypersensitivity) in the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE 
Treatment Period was 9.4% (EAIR: 6.4/100 participant-years). The most frequently reported 
hypersensitivity reactions by PT were eczema (1.4%), dermatitis allergic (1.3%), and dermatitis and 
dermatitis contact (0.7% each). 
Hypersensitivity reactions (5.0%; EAIR: 5.17/100 participant-years) were reported for the active 
reference drug (adalimumab) in PA0010. 
Of the 132 study participants in the bimekizumab Total group with potential hypersensitivity reactions, 
one study participant had a potential hypersensitivity reaction reported as a serious event. The event (PT 
dermatitis) was moderate in intensity, not considered drug-related and did not lead to study 
discontinuation. 
Five study participants had potential hypersensitivity reactions that led to study discontinuation. Thirty-
one study participants had potential hypersensitivity reactions considered drug related, and 1 study 
participant had severe hypersensitivity reactions. The majority of the hypersensitivity reactions (79.4%) 
were resolved. 
Pool SP2 Update 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of hypersensitivity was 10.8% (EAIR: 6.2/100 participant-years). The most 
frequently reported hypersensitivity reactions by PT were eczema (1.8%), dermatitis allergic (1.3%), and 
dermatitis and dermatitis contact (0.8% each). One potential hypersensitivity reaction reported as severe 
in intensity in the bimekizumab group (PT: dermatitis allergic) was considered drug related and led to 
study discontinuation 
Administration and injection site reactions  
In Pool SP1, the incidence of injection site reactions by HLT during the Initial Treatment Period was low 
and reported by 1.1% of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and by 0.7% of study 
participants in the placebo group. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 193/234 
 
 
 
 
  
In Pool SP2, the incidence of injection site reactions was 2.3% in the bimekizumab Total group. The most 
frequently reported injection site reactions by PT were injection site erythema (1.1%) and injection site 
reaction (0.6%). The incidence of injection site reactions was 9.3% for adalimumab in PA0010. 
Overall, Safety Update results were comparable with those in the original submission. 
Hepatic TEAEs and LFT elevations 
Pool SP1 
Hepatic TEAEs 
The incidence of hepatic TEAEs was 4.0% (EAIR: 13.1/100 participant-years) in the bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W group compared to 2.7% (EAIR: 8.7 /100 participant-years) in the placebo group.   
All hepatic TEAEs in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and all in the placebo group occurred in 1 study 
participant each apart from gamma-glutamyl transferase and liver function test increased (0.9% each), 
hepatic steatosis and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (0.7% each), blood bilirubin increased, 
and hepatic enzyme increased (0.6%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase (0.4%), and 
transaminases increased (0.3%). 
Four study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group discontinued the study due to drug 
induced liver injury, blood bilirubin increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, and hepatic enzyme 
increased.  
One study participant in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s 
Law (ALT or AST ≥3xULN and total bilirubin ≥2xULN in the absence of ALP ≥2xULN). Due to the 
alternative explanations for the LFT elevations (alcohol abuse, obesity, concomitant treatment with 
methotrexate) this event was not considered a Hy’s Law case.  
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of any hepatic TEAEs in the bimekizumab Total group was 9.3% (EAIR: 
6.3/100 participant-years). The most frequently reported hepatic TEAEs by PT in the bimekizumab Total 
group were ALT increased (3.0%), and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased and AST increased 
(2.3% each). 
2 serious hepatic TEAEs (both drug-induced liver injury) were reported. Two participants in the 
bimekizumab Total group met laboratory criteria for PDILI. Both cases resulted in withdrawal from study 
and were considered possibly related to study medication. Both cases were confounded by concomitant 
medication Nimesulide and methotrexate for one case and methotrexate and sertraline for the other case. 
In total, five participants reported 6 hepatic TEAEs that led to study discontinuation: hepatic enzyme 
increased and drug-induced liver injury (2 participants [0.1%] each) and ALT increased, and blood 
bilirubin increased (1 participant [<0.1%] each). 
The incidence of hepatic TEAEs reported for the active reference drug (adalimumab) in PA0010 was 9.3% 
(EAIR: 10.2/100 participant-years). 
Pool SP2 update 
In Pool SP2, the incidence of any hepatic TEAEs was 10.5% (EAIR: 6.0/100 participant-years). No new 
serious or severe hepatic TEAEs were reported in this Safety Update. No new participants met the 
laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law

1.3% of bimekizumab exposed study participants had an AST or ALT elevation >3×ULN. Four study 
participants (0.6%) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had at least one incidence of ALT or AST 
>5×ULN. One study participant had an ALT >8xULN. No subjects in placebo group had an AST or ALT 
elevation >3×ULN 
Table 79: Treatment-emergent abnormal liver function during the Initial Treatment Period 
(Pool SP1) 
Pool SP2 
Sixteen study participants (1.1%) in the bimekizumab Total group had at least one incidence of ALT or 
AST >5×ULN. Ten participants had multiple peaks/persistent LFT elevations and in each case an alternate 
aetiology (including LFT elevation due to hepatitis E or alcohol abuse), risk factor including concomitant 
medications (such as MTX, meloxicam, diclofenac, valsartan), and/or underlying medical conditions (as 
cholelithiasis, hepatic steatosis, fatty liver disease, obesity) could have led to the LFT elevations. The 
remaining 6 participants all had isolated spikes or transient increases and either had an alternative 
aetiology, one or more strong confounders or were temporally not considered due to bimekizumab 
EMA/235043/2023

treatment. Five of the 16 participants with at least one incidence of ALT or AST >5×ULN were withdrawn 
due to the elevated liver enzymes. 
One case met Hy’s law laboratory criteria but was not considered a confirmed Hy’s law case as the LFT 
elevations were attributed to excessive alcohol consumption prior to testing. 
16 cases of liver enzyme TEMA (ALT or AST >5×ULN) were independently and blindly adjudicated by an 
external Hepatology Adjudication Committee (HAC) using the drug-induced liver injury network scoring 
system (Fontana et al,2009): 12 were adjudicated as unlikely to be related to study medication whereas 
4 were considered as possibly related. None of the TEMA cases of liver enzyme elevations across the PsA 
development program were adjudicated as definitely, highly likely, or probably related to the 
investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
Pool SP2 update 
Twenty study participants (1.4%) in the bimekizumab Total group had at least 1 incidence of ALT or AST 
>5×ULN.  
The majority of the ALT/AST CTCAE Grade 3 or above findings were transient. Four new cases of AST 
>5xULN were reported in addition to the previous cases. There were no new >5xULN elevations of ALT. 
In all study participants, abnormal liver function values were transient and reduced from the peak within 
a few days and all cases had other more likely causes of the events.  
These 4 cases were independently and blindly adjudicated by the HAC, and 3 cases were adjudicated as 
unlikely because of either clear alternative explanations (progressive fatty liver disease with increase in 
obesity in one study participant and elevated CK suggesting muscle injury in another study participant) or 
incompatible chronology of the events (negative dechallenge with LFT values suggestive of alcohol use in 
one study participant). 
One case was considered possibly related given lack of clear alternative explanations; however, the long 
latency and the ratio of AST>ALT makes acute drug-induced liver injury from the study drug unlikely. 
The external, independent HAC also reviewed all TEMA transaminase elevations (ALT or AST >5x ULN) 
data from the development programs of axial spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis and did not detect a 
significant liver safety concern with bimekizumab in any development program to date.

Immunogenicity 
Formation of ADAb and NAb was monitored in all studies in the bimekizumab PsA development program 
for potential association with an increase in the occurrence of TEAEs. 
ADAb assessment up to Week 16 (Pool SP1) 
In Pool SP1, the incidence of study participants who were ADAb positive at Baseline was low (4.0% 
[28/698]). Overall, by Week 16, 31.2% (218/698) of study participants had at least 1 ADAb-positive 
sample. Approximately half of these (15.3% [107/698]) had at least 2 ADAb-positive samples by Week 
16. The incidence of NAb-positive study participants was 10.3% (72/698 participants).

Relationship between ADAb and bimekizumab safety in PsA (Pool SP2) 
51.7% of TEAEs started before the first ADAb-positive result, 65.1% of TEAEs started on or after the first 
ADAb-positive result, and 72.1% of TEAEs for participants who were always ADAb negative. 
Incidences of serious TEAEs by time of onset relative to ADAb status in Pool SP2 were 2.2% for TEAEs 
starting before the first ADAb positive result, 7.9% for TEAEs starting on or after the first ADAb-positive 
result, and 9.5% for TEAEs in participants who were always ADAb negative. When adjusted for exposure, 
the EAIR for TEAEs starting on or after the first ADAb-positive result remained higher than for TEAEs 
starting before the first ADAb-positive result (7.7/100 participant-years [95% CI: 5.6, 10.2] vs 4.5/100 
participant-years [95% CI: 2.3, 7.9]) but was comparable to the EAIR in participants who were always 
ADAb negative (7.8/100 participant-years [95% CI: 5.8, 10.4]). 
Incidences of TEAEs leading to study medication discontinuation by time of onset relative to ADAb status 
in Pool SP2 were 0.5% for TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result, 4.0% for TEAEs starting 
on or after the first ADAb-positive result, and 4.5% for TEAEs in participants who were always ADAb 
negative. The exposure-adjusted incidence for TEAEs starting on or after the first ADAb-positive result 
remained higher than for TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result (3.7/100 participant-years 
[95% CI: 2.3, 5.5] vs 1.1/100 participant-years [95% CI: 0.2, 3.3]) but was comparable to the EAIR in 
participants who were always ADAb negative (3.4/100 participant-years [95% CI: 2.2, 5.2]). There was 
no trend observed for the types of TEAE leading to discontinuation in the study participants who were 
ADAb positive.

Relationship between NAb and bimekizumab safety in PsA (Pool SP2) 
The overall exposure-adjusted TEAE incidence was slightly higher in NAb-positive participants (EAIR:

(140.9/100 participant-years [95% CI: 126.7, 156.4]. The TEAEs with the largest incidence difference 
(≥2.5%) between the groups of NAb-positive and ADAb-negative participants by PT were corona virus 
infection, nasopharyngitis, back pain, rash, and hypertension.

There were increased reports of rash (4.2%) in the Nab +ve group compared with 1.4% in the Nab –ve 
group and 1% in the ADAb-ve group. Hypersensitivity reaction TEAEs were reported before and on/after 
the first ADAb-positive result in ADAb-positive participants (4.2% and 6.5%, respectively) and also in 
ADAb-negative study participants (7.7%).  
When adjusted for exposure, the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction TEAEs was slightly lower for TEAEs 
that started on/after the first ADAb-positive result (6.3/100 participant-years [95% CI: 4.5, 8.7]) 
compared with TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result (8.8/100 participant-years [95% CI: 
5.6, 13.2]) and was comparable to the group that was always ADAb negative (6.4/100 participant-years 
[95% CI: 4.5, 8.7]). One study participant experienced a TEAE of drug hypersensitivity that started 
on/after the first ADAb-positive result.  
No anaphylactic reactions were observed in the PsA Phase 3 studies.  
The rate of injection site reactions was low overall and no association between ADAb and NAb status and 
the occurrence of injection site reactions was observed. In the HLT of Injection site reactions, EAIRs were 
similar in NAb-positive and ADAb-negative participants with EAIRs of 2.1/100 participant-years (95% CI: 
0.8, 4.3) and 2.1/100 participant years (95% CI: 1.1, 3.5), respectively.   
SP2 update 
Pool SP2 was updated with final immunogenicity and safety data from both PA0010 (52 weeks and SFU) 
and PA0011 (16 weeks and SFU) and available data from PA0012 at the cut-off date of 20 May 2022).  
No events were reported for anaphylactic reactions in the Phase 3 studies in PsA.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 200/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The incidence of TEAEs by time of onset relative to ADAb status was comparable to the original SP2 
analysis with 52.4% (TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result), 72.0% (TEAEs starting on or 
after the first and 82.4% (TEAEs for participants who were always ADAb negative). Exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates (EAIRs) were 205.0/100 PYs (95% CI: 182.6, 229.4), 123.7/100 PYs (95% CI: 112.4, 
135.8), and 141.7/100 PYs (95% CI: 128.0, 156.4), respectively. The TEAEs with the largest incidence 
difference (≥2.5%) between TEAEs starting on/after the first ADAb-positive result and TEAEs starting 
before the first ADAb-positive result by PT were oral candidiasis (6.1% vs 2.9%), nasopharyngitis (9.7% 
vs 5.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (6.2% vs 3.4%), urinary tract infection (6.1% vs 3.1%), 
corona virus infection (15.5% vs 1.9%) and arthralgia (3.6% vs 0.7%). The incidence of injection site 
reaction TEAEs was 1.6% for TEAEs starting before the first ADAb-positive result and 1.3% for TEAEs 
starting on/after the first ADAb-positive result. 
The overall TEAE EAIR was 139.2/100 PYs (95% CI: 117.6, 163.6) in the highest ADAb titer category of ≥
180 compared with 141.7/100 PYs (95% CI: 128.0, 156.4) in ADAb-negative study participants.  
The overall exposure-adjusted TEAE incidence was slightly higher in NAb-positive participants (EAIR: 
155.6/100 PYs [95% CI: 135.1, 178.3]) compared with ADAb-negative participants (141.7/100 
participant-years [95% CI: 128.0, 156.4]);  
The HLT of Injection site reactions, EAIRs were similar in NAb-positive and ADAb-negative participants 
with EAIRs of 1.8/100 PYs (95% CI:0.8, 3.6) and 1.4/100 PYs (95% CI: 0.7, 2.5), respectively. The rate 
of injection site reactions was low overall and no association between ADAb and NAb status and the 
occurrence of injection site reactions was observed.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Pool SP1 
During the Initial Treatment Period, the incidence of TEMA haematology values was 1.3% in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.2% in the placebo group. Neutrophils low were reported for 5 
participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.7%). Lymphocytes low were reported for 4 
participants in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.6%). Two of these participants had low 
lymphocyte count since Baseline. None of the 4 participants with TEMA lymphocytes low values had any 
concurrent infections and all recovered without treatment interruption. 
Pool SP2 
The incidence of markedly abnormal haematology data was 2.6% in the bimekizumab Total group. 
Haemoglobin low (<8.0g/dL) was reported for two study participants (0.1%). Lymphocytes low 
(<0.5x109/L) was reported for 4 study participants (0.3%). Neutrophils low, reported in 30 study 
participants (2.1%) in the bimekizumab Total group. None of these CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil 
count values were associated with a serious infection and majority of them were transient. All other 
markedly abnormal haematology values were reported in <0.1% of subjects. 
Pool SP2 update 
The incidence of markedly abnormal hematology data was 3.0% in the bimekizumab Total group. The 
most frequent markedly abnormal hematology value was neutrophils low, reported in 36 study 
participants (2.5%) in the bimekizumab Total group. None of these CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil 
count values were associated with a serious infection and the majority of them were transient.

Biochemistry 
Individual study participant changes in laboratory values 
Pool SP1 and SP2 (Original analysis and update) 
There were no clinically meaningful shifts from Baseline to maximum/minimum post-Baseline values in 
any biochemistry parameter. 
Markedly abnormal values (excluding LFTs) 
Pool SP1 
The incidence of TEMA biochemistry laboratory values was 2.6% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
and 2.2% the placebo group. The most frequently reported TEMA biochemistry value was high glucose 
>13.9mmol/L; bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group [1.9%] and the placebo group [1.5%], respectively. The 
proportion of study participants who experienced other TEMA biochemistry laboratory values was low 
(<1.0%). 
Pool SP2 
The incidence of markedly abnormal biochemistry data was 3.9% in the bimekizumab Total group. The 
most frequent markedly abnormal biochemistry value was glucose high, reported in 36 study participants 
(2.6%) in the bimekizumab Total group. All other markedly abnormal biochemistry values occurred in 
<0.5% of study participants. 
Pool SP2 update  
The incidence of markedly abnormal biochemistry values was 4.3% in the bimekizumab Total group. The 
most frequent markedly abnormal biochemistry value was glucose high, reported in 38 study participants 
(2.7%) in the bimekizumab Total group. All other markedly abnormal biochemistry values occurred in 
<0.5% of study participants. 
Vitals signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs 
In Pool SP1, no clinically meaningful changes in SBP and DBP measurements were noted across treatment 
groups. During the Initial Treatment Period, the incidence of shifts in SBP or DBP from Baseline at any 
visit during the Initial Treatment Period was low and similar in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and placebo 
groups. For Pool SP1, the proportion of study participants with normal or elevated BP at Baseline who 
shifted to a maximum post-Baseline Stage 2 category in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was low 
(<5.0%), and no meaningful imbalance was noted compared with placebo. 
In both safety pools, the proportion of study participants who experienced post-Baseline markedly 
abnormal SBP or DBP values in the bimekizumab group was low (<1% [Pool SP1] and <2% [Pool SP2]). 
Pool SP2 Update  
Safety Update results for Pool SP2 were similar to what was observed in the original submission. In Pool 
SP2, the proportion of study participants who experienced post-Baseline markedly abnormal SBP or DBP 
values in the bimekizumab Total group was low (≤2.1%) 
Physical examination findings 
No safety concern was identified from physical examination findings including body weight over time. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 202/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Electrocardiograms 
Standard 12-lead ECGs that included QTcF, RR, PR, QRS, and QT variables were performed as outlined in 
the study protocols. All ECGs in the Phase 3 program were read by a central cardiologist. No notable 
trends were observed in the 12-lead ECG results across all treatment groups in Pool SP1. No notable 
trends were observed in the 12-lead ECG central interpretation results during the combined Initial, 
Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period for Pool SP2.   
QTcF increases 
For Pool SP1, no study participant had QTcF>500ms. No notable trends were observed in the 12-lead 
ECG central interpretation results for Pool SP1.  
For Pool SP2, one study participant had QTcF >500ms with no associated cardiac TEAE. 
Safety Update results for Pool SP2 were similar to what was observed in the original submission. 
Adverse events related to ECG findings 
In Pool SP2, 1 study participant was identified as experiencing any Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation. 
The PT for the event was sudden death and it was serious, severe in intensity, and not considered related 
to study medication.  
One study participant had QTcF >500ms with no associated cardiac TEAE. Overall, taking into account 
both the duration of exposure and frequency of assessments, there is no increase of abnormal findings 
over time. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In both Pool SP1 and Pool SP2, similar proportions of participants were <40 years of age (23.9% and 
23.8%, respectively), 40 to <65 years of age (64.1% and 64.2%, respectively), and ≥65 years of age 
(12.1% and 12.1%, respectively). 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, the incidences of TEAEs in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group were higher in the 40 to <65 
year age group (54.6%) compared with the <40 years and ≥65 years groups (49.1%  and 46.5%, 
respectively), while in the placebo group the incidences were higher in the ≥65 years group (50.0%) 
compared with the <40 and 40 to <65 years age groups (40.6%, and 44.6%, respectively) Treatment-
emergent AEs were most frequently reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations in the <40, 40 to 
<65, and ≥65 year groups (26.6%, 26.9%, 29.1%, respectively, in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
and 16.7%, 17.8%, and 18.8%, respectively, in the placebo group). The incidence of infections was 
similar in different age groups. Higher incidences by HLT in the ≥65 years group were noted for Candida 
infections in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group (0.6%, 2.3%, and 8.1%, respectively). Higher 
incidences by PT in the ≥65 years group were noted for oral candidiasis in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group (0%, 2.3%, and 7.0%, respectively).  
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, in the bimekizumab Total group, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar across the age 
groups (80.2%, 75.8%, and 78.7%, respectively, for the <40, 40 to <65, and ≥65 year groups). 
Treatment-emergent AEs were most frequently reported in the SOC of Infections and infestations 
(54.1%, 51.5%, and 54.4%, respectively). Within the HLT Candida infections, the PT of oral candidiasis in 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 203/234 
 
 
 
 
  
the ≥65 years group (10.1%) was slightly higher than that in the 40 to <65 years age group (7.2%) and 
higher than that in the<40 years age group (3.6%).

Treatment Period – overview (analysis set: Pool SP2 – Phase 3 studies) 
Body Weight 
In Pool SP2, in the bimekizumab Total group incidence of TEAEs was higher in the>100kg weight group 
compared with the ≤100kg weight group for any TEAEs (81.8% and 76.1%, respectively) and for serious 
TEAEs (11.5% and 8.5%, respectively), discontinuations due to TEAEs (6.5% vs 3.7%), and severe 
TEAEs (7.8% vs 5.4%). Of the 3 deaths that occurred in the bimekizumab PsA program, 2 occurred in 
study participants with a body weight of ≤100kg, and 1 occurred in a study participant with a body 
weight >100kg. 
Study participants in the >100kg weight group had a higher incidence of TEAEs compared with the 
≤100kg weight group in the following SOCs: Hepatobiliary disorders (5.6% and 3.1%, respectively), 
Investigations (16.4% and 13.4%, respectively), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (13.0% and 6.7%, 
respectively), HLT Diabetes mellitus (incl subtypes): 5.6% and 0.8%, respectively, Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (21.6% and 16.9%, respectively), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (9.7% and 6.6%, respectively), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (19.0% and 16.3%, 
respectively), Cardiac disorders SOC (3.9% and 1.9% respectively). 
Many of the reported TEAEs were considered not related to bimekizumab but are expected comorbidities 
of being overweight. 
By TEAE PT, an inverse relationship between body weight and oral candidiasis was observed with a higher 
incidence in the ≤100kg weight group (7.2%) than in the >100kg weight group (4.8%). The HLT Candida 
infections was reported in 8.9% of participants ≤100kg and 6.3% of participants >100kg. 
Pool SP2 update 
Safety Update results for Pool SP2 were similar to what was observed in the original submission. 
Gender 
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1, the incidences of TEAEs were higher in female study participants compared with male study 
participants regardless of treatment (55.0% vs 49.2%, respectively in bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
and 51.8% vs 35.3%, respectively in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent AEs were most frequently 
reported and at a higher incidence (≥5%) in female compared with male bimekizumab-treated study 
participants in the SOC Infections and infestations.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 205/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2, 666 study participants (47.5%) were male and 735 (52.5%) were female. The same trend 
with higher incidences of TEAEs in female compared with male study participants was observed in Pool 
SP2 in the bimekizumab Total group (77.4% in female study participants and 71.9% in male study 
participants). Treatment-emergent AEs were most frequently reported at a higher incidence (≥5%) in 
female study participants compared with male study participants in the Infections and Infestation (female 
56.3% and male 48.2%, respectively) and Musculoskeletal SOCs ((female 20.5% and male 14.7% 
respectively). Differences by HLT were noted for Upper respiratory tract infections (40.8% vs 34.3%) and 
Urinary tract infections (11.4% vs 2%), and Candida infections (19.2% vs 16.1%) respectively.    
Pool SP2 update 
In Pool SP2, 675 study participants (47.8%) were male and 738 (52.2%) were female. The same trend of 
higher incidence of TEAEs in female compared with male study participants was observed in Pool SP2 in 
the bimekizumab Total group (86.3% in female study participants and 81.0% in male study participants). 
Additional treatment emergent AEs were most frequently reported at a higher incidence (≥5%) in female 
study participants compared with male study participants in the SOC of Infections and infestations 
(65.2% for females and 55.3% for males). 
Race   
In Pool SP2, there were a total of 1341 White (95.7%), 7 Black (0.5%), 41 Asian (2.9%), and 12 other 
(0.9%) study participants. Based on these data, the low numbers of Black, Asian, and other study 
participants do not allow for meaningful interpretation of the safety in race subgroups. 
Safety Update results for Pool SP2 were similar to what was observed in the original submission 
Extrinsic Factors 
Two subgroups for extrinsic factors were analysed geographic region and Baseline cDMARD type.  
Geographic region 
The incidence of TEAEs in bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group was highest in Asia (75.9%) and lowest in 
Eastern Europe (45.5%) A similar picture was observed for Pool SP2; the incidence of TEAEs was higher 
in Asia (88.3%) compared with the other regions (74.9% [Eastern Europe], 79.1% [North America], and 
80.6% [Western Europe]). The incidences of TEAEs were comparable for the geographic regions for the 
SOC of Infections and Infestations (range 49.4% to 54.4%). No trends of specific TEAEs have been 
observed by geographic region. 
Pool SP2 update 
In Pool SP2, in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab group, the incidence of TEAEs was 93.9% in Asia, 80.4% in 
Eastern Europe, 84.5% in North America, and 90.2% in Western Europe. The incidences of TEAEs were 
comparable for the geographic regions for the SOC of Infections and Infestations (range: 55.6% to 
63.8%). 
Baseline DMARD type 
Treatment-emergent AEs were summarised for study participants in the following subgroups: MTX (alone 
or with other cDMARDs), Other cDMARDs (any cDMARD other than MTX) and No MTX or other DMARD. 
Methotrexate was being used by 55.2% of study participants, while other cDMARDs were used by 9.3% of 
study participants. A total of 35.5% of study participants were not receiving any cDMARDs and 30.4% 
had prior anti-TNF therapy. The majority of study participants (62.4%) had used 1 prior cDMARD, while 
25.8% used no prior cDMARDs and 11.8% used at least 2 prior cDMARDs. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 206/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Pool SP1 
In Pool SP1 in the placebo group, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in the other cDMARDs group 
(52.4%) compared with the MTX and no MTX or other cDMARDs groups (42.7% and 44.3%, 
respectively). The inverse relationship was observed in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4 group: the incidence 
of TEAEs was lower in the other cDMARDs (42.0%) group than in the MTX and no MTX or other cDMARDs 
groups (53.6% and 53.1%, respectively). In the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group, the incidences of 
TEAEs were comparable for the Baseline cDMARD subgroups for the SOC of Infections and Infestations 
(range 26.7% to 27.5%). No trends of specific TEAEs have been observed by baseline DMARD type. 
Pool SP2 
In Pool SP2 in the bimekizumab Total group, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in the MTX and other 
cDMARDs groups (79.2% each) compared with the no MTX or other cDMARDs group (73.5%). The 
incidences of TEAEs by SOCs were generally comparable for the Baseline cDMARDs subgroups.  
Study participants in the no MTX or other cDMARDs subgroup reported fewer TEAEs compared with the 
other Baseline cDMARDs subgroups in the SOC of Infections and infestations. 
Pool SP2 update 
In Pool SP2 in the bimekizumab Total group, the incidence of TEAEs was similar in the MTX (84.5% each) 
and other cDMARDS groups (84.8%) compared with the no MTX or other cDMARDs group (82.4%). 
Although the proportion of study participants receiving other cDMARDs was smaller, overall, safety profile 
of bimekizumab in combination with MTX was similar to that observed when given in combination with 
other cDMARDs or as a monotherapy. Study participants in the no MTX or other cDMARDs subgroup 
reported fewer TEAEs compared with the other MTX and baseline cDMARDs subgroups in the SOC of 
Infections and infestations. (62.1% vs 61.4% vs 57.7% respectively (BKZ Total population)). 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of bimekizumab in pregnant women since female study 
participants of childbearing potential were required to use a highly effective method of birth control and 
study drug was discontinued as per pre-specified withdrawal criteria if they became pregnant. No clinical 
study has been specifically designed to evaluate the safety of bimekizumab in pregnant or lactating 
women; in the UCB Global Safety Database as of the clinical cut-off date (04 January 2022), 1 maternal 
bimekizumab exposure pregnancy was reported in the studies included in Pool SP2. In PA0010, there was 
1 pregnancy in the partner of a male study participant. The pregnancy resulted in delivery at full term 
infant by vaginal delivery. No abnormalities were reported. In PA0011, one study participant had an 
unintended pregnancy (nonserious adverse event) that occurred 116 days after the first, and 22 days 
after the most recent, bimekizumab injections. Per the Investigator, the pregnancy was due to 
contraceptive failure. The study participant experienced a post-treatment serious adverse event of severe 
nephrolithiasis 152 days after the final dose was given. Following cystoscopy and ureteral stent insertion, 
a serious infection (septic shock) was reported. Rapid deterioration in the participant’s condition was 
noted and she experienced post-treatment severe SAEs of septic shock; premature separation of 
placenta; and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP 
syndrome). She underwent an emergency caesarean section secondary to coagulation disorder and 
partial placental abruption. She delivered a premature baby girl at 25 weeks and 5 days of gestational 
age, (weight of 740g and height 31cm) with failure to thrive but no developmental delay or congenital 
abnormality was detected; the baby did not survive. The action taken with study drug was reported as 
not applicable for the unintended pregnancy. The unintended pregnancy resolved on 21 June 2020, 133 
days after onset. The nephrolithiasis was reported as resolving at the time of this report. The premature 
separation of placenta resolved on 21 June 2020, same day as the onset. The HELLP syndrome resolved 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 207/234 
 
 
 
 
  
on 22 June 2020. The septic shock resolved on 28 June 2020. No congenital anomaly or maternal 
complications were reported that had a reasonable likelihood of being associated with bimekizumab 
exposure at the time of conception. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction study with bimekizumab has been performed.  
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) data analysis indicated that the apparent clearance of bimekizumab was 
not impacted by concomitant administration of methotrexate, corticosteroids or cDMARDs. In addition, 
bimekizumab concentrations were found to be generally comparable between bDMARD naive and TNF-IR 
patients with PsA in studies PA0010 and PA0011, respectively. These results were confirmed by 
population PK analysis suggesting no clinically relevant impact for prior biologic use on bimekizumab 
apparent clearance or steady-state exposure. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Pool SP1 
During the Initial Treatment Period, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation in Pool SP1 was 
1.4% in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and 0.7% in the placebo group. No obvious trend in TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation was identified. 
Pool SP2 
During the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period, the incidence of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation was 4.8%. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations 
(1.5%), Gastrointestinal disorders (0.9%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.7%). 
Pool SP2 updated 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 5.7% of study participants in the bimekizumab 
Total group. The EAIR for TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the Safety Update (3.0/100 participant-
years) was similar compared with the original submission (3.1/100 participant-years).  
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation in the bimekizumab Total group were most frequently 
reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (1.7%), and Gastrointestinal disorders and Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.8% each).

Clinical-use study (DV0004) 
No adverse device effects (ADEs) were reported in this sub-study. There were no TEADEs, no SADEs, no 
study participant discontinuations due to TEADEs, and no deaths reported for either device presentation. 
There were 11 injection site reaction AEs reported during the study; however, none were assessed to be 
related to the device presentation (based on the Investigator’s judgement) and all were reported to be 
mild in intensity. 
Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively since approval on 20 August 2021 up to data lock point on 19 February 2022, the post-
authorisation patient exposure outside of clinical studies to bimekizumab is estimated to be 
approximately 588 patient-years. During the interval of the Bimzelx PSUR (20 August 2021 to 19 
February 2022), no safety related findings have been identified.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of bimekizumab has been evaluated in Phase 2 (PA008 and PA009) and Phase 3 (PA0010, 
PA001 and PA0012) clinical studies in patients with active PsA. Pooled data are presented to assess short-
term (16 week – SP1) and longer-term safety (SP2) up to the data cut-off dates (25 October 2021 for 
Study PA0010; 22 December 2021 for Study PA0011; and 04 January 2022 for PA0012). In the initial 
submission, pooled safety data were available for at least 16 weeks of treatment for all subjects. At the 
Week 24 data cut, 75% of study participants in PA0010 had reached Week 52. Upon CHMP request’s, the 
MAH has provided an updated safety analysis for safety pool SP2. The update consisted of long-term 
safety data from the 52-week Phase 3 study PA0010 that was ongoing at the time of the original 
submission data cut off. PA0010 is now completed and the Pool SP2 update included all data up through 
the completion of the Safety Follow-Up (SFU) Period (database lock 27 July 2022). In addition, all SFU 
data from the completed Phase 3 study PA0011 (database lock 04 March 2022) and all safety data 
entered into the open-label extension (OLE) study PA0012 database as of the designated clinical cut-off 
date (20 May 2022 [the last Week 52 Visit in PA0010]) were included. The open-label follow-up study 
PA0012 is ongoing; final CSR will be submitted post-approval (see RMP). 
Safety outcomes of interest include MACE, malignancy, IBD, serious infection, SIB, neutropenia, hepatic 
events and serious hypersensitivity. 
Exposure 
A total of 1413 subjects have been exposed with 1143 subjects exposed to bimekizumab 160 mg Q4W 
across the phase 2/3 studies for PsA for ≥ 1 year. This builds on the 1789 study participants exposed to 
bimekizumab in the PSO development plan. The ICH E1 drug exposure requirements have thus been met.  
Pooled placebo-controlled safety data are available for at least 16 weeks of treatment for all subjects in 
the two pivotal trial PA0010 and PA0011. The Pool SP2 update includes 12 additional study participants 
(study participants in the adalimumab group in the feeder studies who enrolled in PA0012) in comparison 
to the original submission. A total of 1413 study participants with PsA with a total time at risk of 2664.0 
participant-years in the bimekizumab Total group are represented compared with 1401 study participants 
with a total time at risk of 2217.5 participant-years in the original submission. Safety Pool S3 included 
combined data through Week 16 from the psoriatic arthritis, axial spondylarthritis and psoriasis 
development programs and was used to identify adverse drug reactions for bimekizumab.  
Overall, the pooling strategy is rational and supports comparisons against placebo during the initial 16 
weeks of PsA studies, and longer-term safety tolerability in the PsA indication. Determinations of ADRs 
based on evaluation of bimekizumab across all exposed patients is endorsed. Different posology for the 
dermatology and rheumatology indications should be kept in mind. Different background rates of 
comorbidities for PSO, PsA and axSpA were taken into account. 
As this is a chronic condition, Study PA0012 open-label extension of up to 140 weeks (~2.7 years) will 
assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab however this may not be adequate 
to capture some rarer risks or risks with longer latency, i.e. malignancy. A study protocol for a cohort 
study on the safety of bimekizumab in patients with plaque psoriasis was concluded at PRAC. This is a 10-
year, non-interventional, post-authorisation study to evaluate any potential increase in the risk of safety 
outcomes of interest (MACE, malignancy, serious infections, inflammatory bowel disease and serious 
hypersensitivity reactions) in bimekizumab-exposed plaque psoriasis (PSO) patients compared to PSO 
patients exposed to other biologics indicated for moderate to severe PSO. Upon CHMP’s request, PsA 
indication was added to the planned PASS (see RMP). A revised protocol will be submitted within 3 
months.

Demographic and Baseline characteristics 
Overall, demographic and Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups and 
are reflective of a population with active PsA patients who are candidates for treatment with bDMARDs. 
There were no notable differences in demographic and Baseline characteristics between Pool SP1 and Pool 
SP2. The majority of study participants were White (95,7% in pool S1), inclusion of other racial groups 
was very low. The reported comorbidities were expected for the PsA population. Exclusion criteria were 
selected to recruit a study population close to the real-world patients with active PsA, while ensuring the 
safety of the study participants. The prevalence of some co-morbidities could be higher in real-world 
patients. 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
In the initial 16-week placebo-controlled period, TEAEs were reported at a higher incidence in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group (52.3% vs 44.3%). AEs were mostly 
non-serious (> 98%), mild to moderate in severity (> 98%), and did not require drug discontinuation (> 
98 %). Drug related TEAEs were more commonly reported in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group 
(19.5%) compared with of the placebo arm (9.5%). 
TEAEs were most commonly reported in the Infections and infestations SOC, in the high-level terms 
(HLTs) Upper respiratory tract infections and Candida infections. The most commonly reported TEAEs 
were, nasopharyngitis (7.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.9%), headache (3.6%), diarrhoea 
(2.7%), and oral candidiasis (2.3%). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity in Pool 
SP1 with low rates of discontinuation of study drug. 
The AE profile in placebo-controlled study periods resembles the AE profile observed in the initial 
submission for the psoriasis indication, apart from oral candidiasis (7.3%) which was reported more 
frequently in the PSO MAA. 
In Pool SP2 (updated), the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT by PT were corona virus infection 
(14.2%), nasopharyngitis (13.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.0%), urinary tract infection 
(7.9%), and oral candidiasis (7.5%).  
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity in Pool SP2 (updated). The incidence of severe 
TEAEs was 6.5% (EAIR 3.6/100 participant-years). The most frequently reported severe TEAEs occurred 
in the SOC of Infections and infestations 1.1% (EAIR 0.6/100PYs). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate 
(EAIR) for TEAEs was similar to that in the original submission. There was no evidence of increase in risk 
with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
In the updated safety analysis, the data for time to onset of TEAEs were similar to the original submission 
up to week 52. The incidence of TEAEs and SAEs increases noticeably after week 52. The MAH has 
clarified that the increase in reports of TEAEs and serious TEAEs after week 52 is due to the increased 
exposure in this time period. 
Adverse drug reactions  
All ADRs were in line with the previously established safety profile of bimekizumab in the approved PSO 
indication. All of the identified ADRs are adequately reflected in the PI.  No new or changes in frequency 
category of existing ADRs are proposed based on the analyses of the updated Pool SP2 safety data. This 
is agreed. 
COVID-19 pandemic 
The incidence of TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection were slightly higher in the placebo (1.5% 
EAIR: 4.7/100 participant-years) compared to the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (0.7% EAIR: 2.3/100 
participant-years) groups in Pool SP1. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 211/234 
 
 
 
 
  
The incidence of TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection was 7.5% (EAIR: 4.9/100 participant-years) 
in the bimekizumab Total group in Pool SP2 in the original submission and 14.2% (EAIR: 8.0/100 
participant-years) in Pool SP2 (updated) reflecting the increased prevalence of COVID-19 infection over 
time during the conduct of these studies. In Pool SP2 there were 9 serious TEAEs of corona virus infection 
/COVID-19 related. The incidence of serious TEAEs with the PT of corona virus infection in the 
bimekizumab Total group in Pool SP2 was 0.5% (EAIR: 0.3/100 participant-years). All occurred in study 
participants who were unvaccinated and had underlying risk factors. No COVID-19 infections resulted in 
study discontinuation.  
SAEs and Deaths 
Three deaths were reported in patients receiving bimekizumab. Two of these deaths were associated with 
significant cardiovascular risks and co-morbidity and it is agreed they are unlikely to be related to the 
study medications in the PsA studies. No exact cause was identified for the event of sudden death as no 
autopsy was conducted and no death cert was available. The third death was related to a road traffic 
accident (RTA) and was not related to study medication. 
Twelve SAEs were reported in the bimekizumab (1.7% EAIR 5.5/100PYS) treated group in Pool SP1.There 
were 2 reports each of pneumonia and joint injury. All other reports were reported in one subject each. 
There is no obvious clustering or pattern in the type of event reported. 
In Pool SP2 (updated), the incidence of serious TEAEs was 10.5% (EAIR 5.9/100 participant-years) in the 
bimekizumab Total group. There was no increase in EAIRs with longer duration of exposure (EAIR: 
5.9/100 participant-years in the Safety Update vs 6.0/100 participant-years in the original submission.  
The most common serious TEAEs by PT in the bimekizumab Total group were cholelithiasis (0.6%; EAIR 
0.3/100 PYs), corona virus infection (0.5%; EAIR 0.3/100 PYs), and osteoarthritis (0.4%; EAIR 0.2/100 
PYs). 
The incidence rates of SAEs for the PsA safety pools were broadly comparable, albeit slightly lower than 
those observed in the PSO S1 and S2 safety pools. 
Safety Topics of Interest 
Analyses focusing on Pool SP1 and Pool SP2 (update) are provided for infections, malignancies, MACE, 
neutropenia, SIB, IBD, anaphylactic, hypersensitivity, and injection-site reactions, and hepatic TEAEs and 
LFT elevations. Overall, the frequency of AEs categorised as adverse events of special interest including 
important potential and identified risks was generally similar in both Pool SP1, SP2 and SP2 (updated), 
except for small increases in the adjudicated MACE (EAIR SP1 0/100PYs vs SP2 (updated) 0.4/100PYs), 
SIB adjudicated neuropsychiatric events (EAIR SP1 0/100PYs vs SP2(updated) 0.1/100PYs), 
hypersensitivity reactions (EAIR SP1 5.5/100PYs vs SP2(updated) 6.2/100/PYs) and adjudicated IBD 
(EAIR SP1 0/100PYs vs SP2(updated) 0.3/100PYs), all of which recorded a slightly higher EAIR in Pool 
SP2 (updated) compared to SP1. 
Serious Infection 
The overall rate of serious infections in PsA patients treated with bimekizumab is similar albeit slightly 
lower than the rates of infection in the psoriasis indication (Pool SP2 PSA EAIR 1.2/100PYs vs Pool S2 PSO 
EAIR 1.4/100PYS respectively). 
The EAIR for updated SP2 safety pool was 1.1 /100PYs showing no increase compared with the original 
submission (1.2/100 participant-years). An additional 4 additional serious infections (cellulitis, 
pyelonephritis, pyelonephritis acute, and corona virus infection) were reported along with the 26 serious 
infections observed in the original submission, Corona Virus infection in 7 study participants, Lower 
respiratory tract infections and Urinary tract infections in 4 study participants each, Bacterial infections 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 212/234 
 
 
 
 
  
NEC and Upper respiratory tract infections in 3 study participants each, and Ear infections in 2 study 
participants were the only PTs reported in more than 1 study participant.   
In pool SP2, the outcome of most serious infections, including the 4 serious events reported in the SP2 
safety update, was resolved. The outcomes of the remaining infections were resolved with sequelae 
(postoperative wound infection), resolving (gangrene), at the time of data cut-off. 
In the original submission the incidence of Fungal infections was lower for the PSA Study population (SP2 
EAIR  10/100PYs) compared to the PSO population (Pool S2 EAIR: 26.0/100 PYs). A similar pattern was 
seen for HLTs Candida infections, Fungal infections NEC and Tinea infections. In Pool SP2 (updated) the 
incidence of any fungal infection was 15.7%. The EAIR (9.4/100 participant-years) did not increase 
compared to the original submission (10.0/100 participant-years). 
The reports of fungal infections were localised, mucocutaneous with low rate of discontinuation. There 
were no reports of systemic fungal infection. The lower rate of fungal infections in the PsA population 
compared to the PSO population is likely to be related to the lower dose of bimekizumab used in the PSO 
studies. 
There were no cases of active TB among bimekizumab-treated study participants. No reactivation of TB in 
study participants with a history of latent TB was observed in the PsA development program and no study 
participant developed active TB. 
Currently serious infections are included as an important identified risk in the RMP. In the SmPC, clinically 
important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis) are included as a contraindication (SmPC Section 
4.3) and information is also included in SmPC Section 4.4 and SmPC Section 4.8 to minimise the risk of 
serious infections. Wording regarding a recommendation to discontinue treatment in patients who develop 
infections that become serious or are not responding to standard therapy has been included in SmPC 
section 4.4. In addition, the section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that Infection rates observed 
in PsA Phase 3 clinical studies were similar to those observed in plaque psoriasis apart from oral and 
oropharyngeal candidiasis rates in patients treated with bimekizumab, which were lower at 2.3% and 0% 
respectively in PsA compared to 0% with placebo.  
Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
There were 6 new onset cases and one case of exacerbation of IBD with bimekizumab (EAIR 0.3/100 
participant-years) in Pool SP2 in the PsA development program. The incidence was somewhat higher than 
that observed during the PSO development program (the EAIR for IBD events was 0.055/100 PYs in the 
Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group in Pool S2 in the PSO MAA). No additional definite or probable IBD 
cases were reported in the SP2 pool safety update. 
The MAH has indicated that a different strategy was used to identify IBD events in the PSO MAA 
submission compared to the PSA submission. Gastrointestinal events of interest (broad inclusive terms) 
were adjudicated by an expert committee as ‘Definite’ and ‘probable’ cases whereas TEAEs coding to HLT 
of “Colitis (excl infective),” were identified in the PSO program surmising that the cases of IBD in the PSO 
program are more likely to be definite cases of IBD. The incidence of definite IBD is still higher in the PsA 
program compared to the PSO program (EAIR 0.113 vs EAIR of 0.055/100 participant-years in the PSO 
program). The mechanism for identifying cases of IBD in the PSA program is more robust. The incidence 
of IBD in the PSO program may have been underreported. Of note, no new definite or probable IBD 
events were reported in the PsA Safety Update and the overall IBD incidence rate in the PsA development 
program has decreased slightly. The difficulties outlined by the MAH, associated with comparisons 
between clinical trial data and observational data, are acknowledged. The MAH’s statement that the 
observed incidence rate in the PsA development program is in line with the published incidence rates of 
other marketed interleukin-17 inhibitors is not further substantiated. Overall, some uncertainty remains 
regarding the risk of developing IBD when treated for PsA with BKZ. The absolute IBD incidence rate in 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 213/234 
 
 
 
 
  
the PsA development program is low. Information related to IBD is described in SmPC Section 4.4 
(Special warnings and precautions for use) and SmPC Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) and is included as 
an important identified risk in the EU Risk Management Plan. It will continue to be closely monitored via 
routine pharmacovigilance activities in Study PS0012 and the post-authorisation safety study (PS0038). 
No additional risk minimisation measures are considered needed at this point. 
Hypersensitivity 
The incidence of any hypersensitivity reactions in bimekizumab treated patients in Pool SP1 was 3.6% 
(EAIR 11/100PYs) compared to 9.4% (EAIR 6.4/100PYs) in Pool SP2. The incidence of hypersensitivity 
reactions was less than that recorded for Pool S2 of the PSO MAA (EAIR 10.9; the PSO development 
program). The incidence of any hypersensitivity reactions in bimekizumab treated patients in Pool SP2 
(updated) was 10.8% (EAIR 6.2/100PYs) 
Dermatitis and Eczema were the most frequently reported allergic reactions in the bimekizumab treated 
patients (Pool SP2) and were also reported more frequently in the bimekizumab treated population 
compared to the active reference drug (adalimumab) in PA0010. The majority of reactions were mild to 
moderate in severity and resolved on treatment. There was 1 serious hypersensitivity reaction 
(dermatitis) that was not considered to be related to study medication. In the SP2 safety update there 
was one potential hypersensitivity reaction reported as severe in intensity in the bimekizumab group (PT: 
dermatitis allergic). It was considered drug related and led to study discontinuation. There were no 
anaphylactic reactions reported. 
Dermatitis and eczema are currently recorded as common side effects in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Hypersensitivity is further described under the subheading ‘Description of selected adverse events’ in 
section 4.8. Serious hypersensitivity reactions which will include serious forms of dermatitis are captured 
under the important potential risk of 'serious hypersensitivity reactions’ in the RMP and will be further 
addressed post-approval. No additional risk minimisation measures are recommended at this time.   
Injection site reactions 
The incidence of injection site reactions was low in Pool SP2 (2.3%) All events were mild or moderate in 
intensity with none leading to discontinuation. The SP2 Safety Update results were comparable with those 
in the original submission. 
MACE 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE (EAIR 0.4/100PYs) reported for the bimekizumab PsA 
program SP2 pool is slightly lower than the EAIR recorded for the S2 pool of the PSO MAA (EAIR 
0.657/100PYs). No MACE were reported for pool SP1. In Pool SP2 (updated), the incidence of adjudicated 
MACE was low (0.7%) and EAIR was the same as the original submission (0.4/100 participant-years). 
MACE with fatal outcome (acute myocardial infarction and sudden death) was reported for two study 
participants in the original submission. One additional participant experienced an adjudicated MACE (PT: 
ischemic stroke) during the safety update period. The event was serious, severe, assessed as not drug 
related by the Investigator, did not lead to study discontinuation, and resolved at time of data cut. 
The majority of adjudicated MACE in the bimekizumab Total group were resolved. No trend was observed 
with respect to the time to onset of the MACE. There is no clear evidence of increased risk of MACE 
beyond that attributable to the potential underlying risk with PsA. MACE is included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP and will continue to be followed up post-marketing in study PA0012. Upon 
CHMP’s request, The MAH has provided narratives of 6 cases of thromboembolic events (PE - 1 case, VTE 
- 5 cases) classified as ‘Any adjudicated cardiovascular TEAES’. All six cases of thromboembolic disease 
identified in the clinical development plan for Bimzelx in PsA had confounding factors (obesity, neoplasm, 
knee injuries). These underlying comorbidities could plausibly have contributed to onset of these events. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 214/234 
 
 
 
 
  
None of these events were assessed as being related to study medication and treatment was continued in 
all cases. There is no clear suggestion of a signal here. Thromboembolic events will continue to be closely 
monitored in future PSURs as part of routine pharmacovigilance. 
Malignancy 
Malignancies were observed at low incidence rates (SP1 EAIR 0.5/100PYs and SP2 EAIR: 0.6/100 PYs) 
and with no trend in type or incidence in the bimekizumab treated study participants. This incidence rate 
was slightly lower than the PSO Pool S2 EAIR: 0.8/100 PYs. No case was fatal. In the Pool SP2 safety 
update incidences of malignant tumor TEAEs were slightly higher in the bimekizumab Total group (1.5%; 
EAIR: 0.8/100 participant-years) compared to the EAIR in the original submission (0.6/100 participant-
years). Six additional malignancy TEAEs (gastric cancer recurrent, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 
ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, bone giant cell tumour, and renal neoplasm) were reported; 1 TEAE 
(ovarian cancer) was considered related to study drug. All TEAEs led to study discontinuation with the 
exception of bone giant cell tumour. There is no obvious clustering of tumour type. It is difficult to draw 
any conclusion on this small increase in incidence. Malignancy is included as an important potential risk in 
the RMP and malignancy will continue to be monitored post-approval over the remainder of Study 012 
and in the planned PASS PS0038 in subjects with PSO.  
Hepatic Events 
In Pool SP1, the incidence of hepatic TEAEs was low (BKZ 4.0% EAIR 13.1 vs PBO 2.7% EAIR 8.7). The 
majority were nonserious and mild to moderate in severity. Four study participants discontinued due to 
hepatic TEAEs including one subject with drug induced liver injury. The proportion of subjects in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group with ALT or AST >5×ULN was low (0.6%). One study participant in the 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law. Due to the alternative 
explanations (alcohol abuse) for the LFT elevations and other confounding risk factors including obesity 
and concomitant MTX, this event was not considered a Hy’s Law case. 
In Pool SP2 the exposure adjusted incidence of hepatic events was lower than that seen in Pool SP1. 
9.3% (EAIR: 6.3/100 participant-years) group. Two cases of pDILI were reported in Pool SP2. Both cases 
were considered to be possibly related to study medication but were confounded by concomitant 
medication and possible alternative aetiology. Both cases were reported as resolved, however GGT>2ULN 
remained in one case. 
In Pool SP2 (updated), the incidence of any hepatic TEAEs was 10.5% (EAIR: 6.0/100 participant-years) 
compared with 9.3% (EAIR: 6.3/100 participant-years) in the original submission. No new serious or 
severe hepatic TEAEs were reported and the incidence of abnormal liver function values was low and 
comparable across all treatment groups. 1.4% in the bimekizumab Total group had at least 1 incidence of 
ALT or AST >5×ULN compared with 1.1% in the original analysis. 
Sixteen cases of TEMA liver enzyme elevations (ALT or AST >5×ULN) were reviewed by a HAC, 12 were 
adjudicated as unlikely to be related to study medication whereas 4 were considered as possibly related. 
All cases had confounding factors, alternative aetiology, or did not have a temporal association with 
bimekizumab. Five participants were withdrawn due to elevated LFTs. In the Pool SP2 update four new 
cases of AST >5xULN were reported in addition to the previous cases. There were no new >5xULN 
elevations of ALT. In all study participants, abnormal liver function values were transient and reduced 
from the peak within a few days and all cases had other more likely causes of the events. 
Overall, no new hepatic signal was identified in the PsA safety pools. 
Neutropenia 
The incidence of neutropenia was low in both safety pools (1.3% in the bimekizumab 160 mgQ4W group 
[Pool SP1] and 2.4% in the bimekizumab Total group [Pool SP2]). Cases were mostly transient and mild 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 215/234 
 
 
 
 
  
to moderate in intensity with isolated severe cases. In Pool SP2, 30 study participants (2.1%) in the 
bimekizumab Total group had a TEMA neutrophils low count. No TEMA neutrophil counts were associated 
with serious infections. 
In the Pool SP2 update, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs was slightly lower compared with the original 
submission (EAIR: 1.4/100 PYs vs EAIR: 1.5/100 participant-years respectively). 6 additional study 
participants in the bimekizumab Total group had a TEMA neutrophils low count. All 6 of these study 
participants had Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil values which were transient, and values returned to 
normal at subsequent visits. None of the neutropenia events were associated with serious infections or 
led to discontinuation. 
The section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that the frequency of neutropenia in PsA clinical 
studies was similar to that observed in plaque psoriasis studies. 
SIB 
No increased risk of suicide or suicidal behaviour was observed under bimekizumab treatment in the PsA 
development program. No completed suicides were observed in study participants treated with 
bimekizumab in the PsA program. In Pool SP2, 1 TEAE of suicidal behaviour was adjudicated as SIB but 
was not considered to be related to study medication. In the Pool SP2 update, there was a slight increase 
in the incidence of adjudicated SIB compared with the original submission (0.1%; EAIR: 0.1/100 
participant-years vs <0.1%; EAIR: 0.0/100 PYs in the respectively). One additional TEAE ‘psychiatric 
evaluation abnormal’ was adjudicated as SIB by the Neuropsychiatric Adjudication Committee. The event 
was reported as severe in intensity, considered not drug related (as assessed by the Investigator), not 
resolved at the time of data cut off, and led to withdrawal of study drug. The study participant had a past 
medical history of anxiety and depression with noncompliance to medications. No new concerns have 
been identified here. 
Clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, and physical examination findings, and ECGs 
No new safety signals were identified on analysis of the laboratory data. No safety signals were observed 
in haematology, biochemistry, vital signs, and physical examination findings. No notable trends were 
observed in the 12-lead ECG results across all treatment groups in Pool SP1 and Pool SP2. 
There were no clinically relevant findings in the updated Pool SP2 analysis of vital signs, physical findings, 
and other observations related to safety. There were no clinically relevant increases in QTcF noted. One 
additional study participant was identified as experiencing ventricular tachycardia (reported term: non 
sustained ventricular tachycardia). It was reported as not serious, was mild in intensity, and was not 
considered related to study drug (as assessed by the Investigator).  
Immunogenicity 
Pool SP1 
By Week 16, 31.2% of study participants had at least 1 ADAb-positive sample. By Week 16, the overall 
incidence of NAb-positive study participants in the overall pooled PsA Phase 3 population was 10.3%. The 
majority of participants were positive for both IL-17AA and IL-17FF. 
Pool SP2  
Available safety and immunogenicity (ADAb and NAb) data from PsA Phase 3 studies PA0010 (including 
data beyond Week 24 at the time of the Week 24 data cut-off), PA0011 and PA0012 (both at the time of 
the Week 16 data cut-off for PA0011) were considered. No notable trends were observed in ADAb or NAb 
positivity on the safety profile of bimekizumab in PsA  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 216/234 
 
 
 
 
  
The MAH has clarified that they were unable to provide pooled immunogenicity data to week 52 based on 
Phase 3 studies in PsA studies due to the different timepoints for collecting ADAb and NAB values across 
the studies. Consequently, there was no cumulative collection timepoint for Study PA0012 for collecting 
52-week data. Therefore, the MAH’s proposal to present antibody data for 52-week results for Study 
PA0010 is acceptable. A further update will be provided on completion of Study 0012 post approval (see 
RMP). 
In Study PA0010, by Week 52, 46.6% of study participants in the bimekizumab 160mg every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) group had ADAb and 17.9% had Nab. Study PA0010 only included treatment naïve subjects. This 
was reflected in for the section 4.8 of the SmPC, as requested. 
The relationship between NAb and bimekizumab safety in PsA (Pool SP1 And Pool SP2) was further 
evaluated with a review of hypersensitivity reactions and administration site reactions. The majority of 
these reactions occurred in subjects who were always ADAb negative. In subjects who were ADAb 
positive the majority of cases started before the first ADAb positive result.  
In the updated Pool SP2 the exposure-adjusted incidence of hypersensitivity and administration site 
reactions was highest in the Nab positive subjects (EAIR 13.4 /100PYs) compared with NAb negative but 
ADAb positive subjects (EAIR 11.4/100PYs). This is mainly down to an exposure-adjusted increase in 
reports of dermatitis and eczema in NAB positive compared to NAB negative subjects (EAIR 8.8/100PYs 
vs 4.4/100PYs). The absolute number of cases remain small. No new safety concerns have been identified 
in relation to ADAb status in this analysis of TEAEs, including injection site reactions and TEAEs of 
hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic reactions. 
The section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that across all indications, an association between 
immunogenicity and TEAEs has not been clearly established.  
Safety in special populations  
Overall, no new safety concerns were identified in an evaluation of TEAE profile, gender, race, and body 
weight. No safety trends were noted that would indicate a need to modify the dose regimen for any of 
these subgroups. Safety data by age, including older subjects >75 years has been provided for review. 
Serious TEAEs (<65yrs; 7.6% vs 65-74 yrs; 15.8% vs 75-84yrs; 28.4%) were reported more frequently 
in the age cohorts >65 years. Upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has provided a tabulated summary and 
comment on SAEs by age group (<65yrs; 65-74 yrs; and 75-84yrs). The increase in SAEs is mainly 
attributed to disorders common in older people. Interpretation of this dataset is difficult due to the 
relatively small size of the dataset. The uncertainty around these findings is reflected in a new statement 
in Section 4.8 of the SmPC stating that exposure is limited in older patients. TEAEs leading to Permanent 
withdrawal of study medication due to TEAEs were also increased in the older age cohorts (<65yrs; 4.1% 
vs 65-74 yrs; 9.9% vs 75-84yrs; 6.3%). The commonest reason for withdrawal was oral candida. SmPC 
section 4.8 has also been updated to include warnings regarding increased reports of candida and 
dermatitis in older patients with PsA.  
Baseline cDMARD type 
The safety profile of bimekizumab in combination with MTX was generally similar to that observed when 
given in combination with other cDMARDs or as a monotherapy. There was some evidence of increased 
infections for bimekizumab in combination treatment with methotrexate or other cDMARDs in Pool SP2. 
These were attributed to URTIs (MTX 29.9% vs other cDMARDS 30.8% vs no cDMARDs 22.6%) and Viral 
infections NEC, mostly due to Corona Virus infections that were more commonly reported in the MTX 
(11.5%) and other cDMARDs groups (13%) than the no cDMARDS group (5%), suggesting a small 
increase in risk in viral for infections with combination therapy. There was no increase in risk for serious 
infections reported.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 217/234 
 
 
 
 
  
In the Pool SP2 (update), study participants in the no MTX or other cDMARDs subgroup (82.4%) reported 
slightly fewer TEAEs compared with the MTX group (84.4%) and other cDMARDs group (84.5%). [Pool 
SP2 updated, BKZ Total]. 
There was some evidence of increased infections for bimekizumab in combination treatment with 
methotrexate (62.1%) or other cDMARDs (61.4%) compared with no MTX or other cDMARDS (57.7%).  
There was no increase in risk for serious infections reported.  
Overall, the proportion of study participants receiving other cDMARDs was small (8.9%). Although no new   
safety issues of concern were identified in this subgroup, knowledge of the comparative safety of 
bimekizumab in combination with cDMARDs other than MTX is insufficient to support the applied for 
indication: treatment with bimekizumab in ‘combination with conventional DMARDs’. The MAH has revised 
this wording to remove reference to treatment in combination with conventional DMARDs and to restrict 
the indication to ‘in combination with methotrexate’. This revised wording is acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile for bimekizumab in the SP1 and SP2 and updated SP2 safety pools for PsA is generally 
consistent with that identified in the PSO MAA submission although serious infections and fungal 
infections were reported less frequently than in the PSO population most likely due to the lower dose of 
bimekizumab used in the initial phase of PsA studies. There is no suggestion of an increase in risk with 
longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
The number of rare and/or long latency events (such as MACE, malignancy, IBD) is typically low in this 
clinical development program. IBD is the only TEAE of special interest that was reported at a slightly 
higher incidence in the PsA studies compared to the PSO indication. The MAH has clarified that different 
methods of identification were used for cases of IBD in the PSO and PsA development programs that may 
contribute to the different reporting rates. The MAH will nevertheless continue to evaluate this safety 
topic post approval (see RMP).  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.7 is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 223/234 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Bimzelx. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis, which is classified 
within the group of the spondyloarthritis. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is an umbrella term applied to a family 
of rheumatic diseases (including psoriatic arthritis [PsA], axial spondyloarthritis [axSpA], reactive 
arthritis, the arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis) that 
have features in common with each other and distinct from other inflammatory arthritides, particularly 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  
PsA generally has, distal interphalangeal joint involvement, asymmetric distribution, dactylitis   
inflammation of the whole digit), enthesitis (inflammation at the site of tendon insertion into bone), spinal 
involvement, and an association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 allele.  
There are many comorbidities that have an increased prevalence in patients with PsA compared to the 
general population such as cardiovascular disease, autoimmune-related conditions (ie, coeliac disease, 
uveitis, and autoimmune bowel disorders), Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperstosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) 
syndrome, depression, and anxiety are also noted to co-occur with PsA. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the treatment of PsA, there are several options available including conventional disease modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic DMARDs. 
Conventional DMARDs (eg, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and 
leflunomide [LEF]) are generally the first line of therapy. If the patient does not respond adequately to 
cDMARDs, a bDMARD or targeted-synthetic DMARD may be considered. Biologic DMARDs include tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF)α inhibitors (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, and certolizumab 
pegol), interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitors (eg, secukinumab and ixekizumab), IL-12/IL-23 inhibitors (eg, 
ustekinumab), and IL-23 inhibitors (eg, risankizumab and guselkumab). Targeted synthetic DMARDs 
include PDE4 inhibitors (eg, apremilast) and JAK inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib, upadacitinib).  
Although the availability of treatment options has expanded over the years, there is still a significant 
unmet need, in particular in patients who are not responsive to these treatments or who do not maintain 
a clinical response. In addition, when patients do respond to treatment, many fail to achieve low disease 
activity or remission. 
Patients with PsA symptoms who are not adequately treated or not well controlled are at risk of 
irreversible life-long joint damage that impacts the patient’s quality of life including mobility, ability to 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 224/234 
 
 
 
 
  
work, and control of pain. Hence, there remains a medical need for additional therapeutic options in PsA 
for patients with inadequate response to or intolerance to currently available therapies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The development programme is based on two pivotal Phase 3 studies that evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of bimekizumab for the treatment of active PsA. 
PA0010 and PA0011 are randomised, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with active PsA through 52 
weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. PA0010 also included an active reference arm (adalimumab). PA0011 
study participants had a history of inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or 2 TNFα inhibitors for either 
PsA or PSO and PA0010 study participants were bDMARD naïve and eligible to receive adalimumab. 
In addition, both studies used the same dose, dosage form, and dosing schedule from Week 0 to Week 
16. Both PsA Phase 3 clinical studies evaluated a dose regimen of bimekizumab 160mg Q4W.  
After completion of the treatment period of PA0010 or PA0011, eligible study participants were allowed to 
enrol in an OLE study, PA0012, where long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab will be 
collected for up to 160 weeks.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary objective was met in both pivotal studies (PA0010 and PA0011). In PA0010, Bimekizumab 
160mg Q4W treatment demonstrated a superior ACR50 responder rate at Week 16 (the primary efficacy 
variable) compared with the placebo group (43.9% vs 10.0%, respectively). This difference is considered 
clinically meaningful, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo of 7.082 (p<0.001). In 
PA0011, treatment with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W demonstrated a superior ACR50 responder rate at 
Week 16 (the primary efficacy variable) compared with the placebo group (43.4% vs 6.8%, respectively). 
This difference is also considered clinically meaningful, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus 
placebo of 11.086 (p<0.001). The results of all supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable 
confirmed the primary efficacy results. 
PA0010 and PA0011 also met all of the ranked secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Change from Baseline HAQ-DI superior to Placebo 
At Week 16 in PA0010, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a greater mean decrease from Baseline 
(ie, improvement) in HAQ-DI compared with the placebo group (-0.2567 vs -0.0880, respectively; 
p<0.001).  
At Week 16 in PA0011, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a greater mean decrease from Baseline 
(ie, improvement) in HAQ-DI compared with the placebo group (-0.3751 vs -0.0701, respectively; 
p<0.001).  
PASI90 Response superior to Placebo 
At Week 16 in PA0010, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher PASI90 responder rate 
compared with the placebo group (61.3% vs 2.9%, respectively; p<0.001) in study participants with PSO 
involving at least 3% BSA at Baseline.  
At Week 16 in PA0011, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher PASI90 responder rate 
compared with the placebo group (68.8% vs 6.8%, respectively; p<0.001) in study participants with PSO 
involving at least 3% BSA at Baseline.  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 225/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Change from Baseline SF-36 PCS superior to Placebo 
At Week 16 in PA0010, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a greater increase from Baseline (ie, 
improvement) in SF-36 PCS score compared with the placebo group (6.219 vs 2.326, respectively; 
p<0.001).  
At Week 16 in PA0011, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a greater increase from Baseline (ie, 
improvement) in SF-36 PCS compared with the placebo group (7.258 vs 1.413, respectively; p<0.001).  
MDA superior to Placebo 
At Week 16 in PA0010, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher MDA responder rate compared 
with the placebo group (45.0% vs 13.2%, respectively; p<0.001).  
At Week 16 in PA0010 the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher MDA responder rate compared 
with the placebo group (44.2% vs 6.0%, respectively; p<0.001).  
Change from Baseline vdHmTSS superior to Placebo on study participants with elevated hs- CRP and/or 
with at least one bone erosion (hs-CRP ≥6mg/L and/or erosion-positive) - PA0010 only 
At Week 16 in PA0010, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a minimal change from Baseline in 
vdHmTSS, indicating inhibition of structural progression, whereas the placebo group worsened (0.04 vs 
0.36, respectively; p<0.001) in study participants with elevated hs-CRP and/or at least 1 bone erosion at 
Baseline.  
Enthesitis-free state superior to Placebo  
The bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher proportion of study participants in the enthesitis-free 
state compared with placebo at Week 16 (49.8% vs 34.9%, respectively; p=0.008) in study participants 
with enthesitis at Baseline in the pooled PA0010/PA0011 population.  
Dactylitis-free state superior to Placebo  
The bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a higher proportion of study participants in the dactylitis-free 
state compared with placebo at Week 16 (75.6% vs 51.1%, respectively; p=0.002) in study participants 
with dactylitis at Baseline in the pooled PA0010/PA0011 population.  
Change from Baseline vdHmTSS superior to Placebo – PA0010 only 
In PA0010, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a minimal change from Baseline in vdHmTSS, 
whereas the placebo group worsened at Week 16 (0.04 vs 0.32, respectively; p=0.001) in all study 
participants.  
Additionally, numerically greater improvements compared with placebo were observed for the non-ranked 
secondary efficacy endpoints following bimekizumab treatment. The results of all supportive analyses of 
the primary and secondary efficacy variables confirmed the results of the primary analyses, and subgroup 
analyses demonstrated consistent efficacy over placebo at Week 16 across multiple subgroups. 
Across both studies, results demonstrated that bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment for 16 weeks 
resulted in improvements in multiple aspects of PsA disease, including improvement in joint and skin 
symptoms, improvement in multiple disease domains (e.g. physical function and peripheral disease 
manifestations), low disease activity, and improvement in patient-reported outcomes of fatigue (FACIT-
Fatigue subscale scores), HRQoL (PsAID-12 response), and social life and work productivity (EQ 5D-3L 
and WPAI-SHP) Inhibition of structural damage in a bDMARD-naïve population was also shown (vdHmTSS 
assessment) in PA0010. 
Updated PA0010 Week 52 efficacy data, provided upon CHMP’s request during the review, demonstrated 
that efficacy outcomes achieved at Week 16 either continued to improve or were sustained up to 1 year 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 226/234 
 
 
 
 
  
(Week 52). At Week 52, in both overall and in the subset of study participants with elevated hs-CRP 
and/or with at least 1 bone erosion at Baseline, the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group and placebo/ 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W group had a minimal mean change from Baseline in the vdHmTSS total score, 
indicating that the inhibition of structural progression observed with bimekizumab treatment was 
sustained.  
In both pivotal Phase 3 studies, participants receiving bimekizumab 160mg Q4W showed significant 
improvement in signs and symptoms of PsA disease within 16 weeks of treatment regardless of whether 
they were bDMARD-naïve or TNFα-IR. The magnitude of improvement was consistent across both 
populations.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There was insufficient representation of patients receiving concomitant treatment with “other csDMARD” 
in the pivotal studies to support B/R assessment in this patient group. Given that the majority of subjects 
enrolled were taking MTX as their cDMARD, the MAH agreed to restrict the indication for use of 
bimekizumab in PsA to monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.   
A largely PK focused rationale has been submitted in support of the proposed posology in patients with 
active PsA who have moderate to severe plaque PSO for bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for the first 16 weeks 
and Q8W thereafter. Nevertheless, further rationale was requested in support of this posology, in 
particular further justification for the efficacy (ACR response) of the proposed maintenance dose regimen 
in patients with PsA and concomitant moderate to severe PSO. In order to give the clinician flexibility in 
the treatment of patients with PsA and concomitant PSO who may not respond optimally to 320mg Q8W 
for joint symptoms in the maintenance phase, a switch to 160 mg Q4W in patients with PsA and 
concomitant PSO is proposed. It is agreed with the MAH that the risk of reduced ACR responses is small. 
The risk is acknowledged as more likely in patients with high body weight, however this risk is mitigated 
by additional posology available for patients with PsA and concomitant PSO and weighing ≥120kg to 
continue dosing with 320mg Q4W after Week 16. In addition, the newly proposed wording supports the 
general PsA treatment goals which aim to reflect patient preferences, with patients being provided with 
the best information concerning relevant options and consideration of all disease domains is available. 
The section 4.2 of the SmPC was thus updated to reflect that after 16 weeks, regular assessment of 
efficacy is recommended and if a sufficient clinical response in joints cannot be maintained, a switch to 
160mg every 4 weeks can be considered.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In Pool SP1 (up to 16 weeks; placebo control), the overall incidence of AEs was 52.3% in the 
bimekizumab treatment groups and 64.4% in the placebo groups, respectively. AEs were mostly non-
serious, mild to moderate in severity, and did not require drug discontinuation. TEAEs were most 
commonly reported in the Infections and infestations SOC, in particular for events related to the high 
level terms (HLTs) Upper respiratory tract infections and Candida infections. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (7.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.9%), headache (3.6%), 
diarrhoea (2.7%), and oral candidiasis (2.3%).  
In Pool SP2 over longer term, the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were nasopharyngitis (11.4%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (8.9%), corona virus infection (7.0%), and oral candidiasis and urinary 
tract infection (6.7% each). In the Pool SP2 update the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were 
corona virus infection (14.2%), nasopharyngitis (13.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.0%), 
urinary tract infection (7.9%), and oral candidiasis (7.5%). The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate 
in intensity. 
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 227/234 
 
 
 
 
  
The incidence of severe TEAEs was 6.0% (EAIR 3.9/100 participant-years). The most frequently reported 
severe TEAEs occurred in the SOC of Infections and infestations: 1.1% (EAIR 0.7/100PYs). Herpes Zoster 
(2 cases), pneumonia (2 cases) and Coronavirus (3 cases) were the only TEAEs reported in more than 
one study participant. The incidence of severe TEAEs in the update Pool SP2 was 6.5% (EAIR 3.6/100 
participant-years) 
In Pool SP1, incidences of serious TEAEs were 1.7% (EAIR 5.5/100PYs) in the bimekizumab 160mg Q4W 
group and 0.7% (EAIR 2.3/100 PYs) in the placebo group during the Initial Treatment Period. In Pool 
SP2, the incidence of serious TEAEs was 9.1% (EAIR 6.0/100PYs) in the bimekizumab Total group. For 
Pool SP2(updated), the incidence of serious TEAEs was 10.5% (EAIR: 5.9/100 PYs). 
A known risk for patients treated with bimekizumab is serious infection. The overall rate of serious 
infections was comparable between Pool SP1 and Pool SP2 (Pool SP1 EAIR 1.4/100PYs vs Pool SP2 EAIR 
1.2/100PYs). The incidence of serious infections in updated Pool SP2 was 2.1% (EAIR 1.1/100 PYs). 
Incidences of fungal infections were higher in the bimekizumab-treated study participants (4.6% EAIR 
15/100PYs)) compared with placebo (1.0% EAIR 3.1/100PYs), mainly driven by oral candidiasis infections 
(2.3% EAIR 7.4/100PYs). In Pool SP2, the incidence of any fungal infection in the bimekizumab Total 
group (which includes participants on higher doses of bimekizumab) was 14.2% (EAIR: 10.0/100 
participant-years). Oral candidiasis (6.7%) and oral fungal infection (2.7%) were the most frequently 
reported fungal infections. In the Pool SP2 update, the incidence of any fungal infection was 15.7% (EAIR 
9.4/100 PYs). No systemic Candida infections were observed in the PsA program. 
Other Safety topics of interest selected by the MAH included malignancies, MACE, neutropenia, SIB, 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypersensitivity reactions, and injection site reactions. IBD was 
reported more frequently in the PsA compared to the PSO clinical development program. The Pool SP2 
safety update results were similar to the original submission. No new safety concerns emerged from 
analyses of these safety topics of interest other than a small increase in reports of malignancy (1.5%; 
EAIR: 0.8/100 participant-years) in this updated analysis compared to the EAIR in the original submission 
(0.6/100 participant-years).   
Serious TEAEs were reported more frequently in the age cohorts >65years. These were mainly attributed  
to age related conditions. TEAEs leading to Permanent withdrawal of study medication due to TEAEs were 
also increased in the older age cohorts. Oral candidiasis was the most commonly reported TEAE leading to 
withdrawal. 
From a safety perspective the incidence of TEAEs in Pool S1 was lower in the other cDMARDs group 
(42%) compared with the MTX and no treatment groups (53.6% and 53.1%, respectively). 
Over the longer term (Pool SP2) the incidence of TEAEs was higher in the MTX and other cDMARDs 
groups compared with the no MTX or other cDMARDs group mainly due to increased reports of URTI and 
coronavirus infections.  
27.9% study participants were ADAb +ve and 10% were NAb +ve positive at week 16 in Pool SP1. In 
Study PA0010 (in treatment naïve patients) by Week 52, 46.6% of study participants had ADAb and 
17.9% had Nab.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In Pool SP2 in the PsA development program, the incidence of IBD was somewhat higher than that 
observed during the PSO development program; the EAIR for IBD events was 0.3/100 PYs in the PSA SP2 
pool vs 0.055/100 PYs in the Pool S2 in the PSO MAA. The MAH has clarified that this may be due to 
differences in the methodology for identifying IBD in the PSO and PSA clinical trials. Nevertheless, this 
safety topic will be closely followed-up post approval (PASS, see RMP).  
EMA/235043/2023 
Page 228/234 
 
 
 
 
  
Immunogenicity data provided so far for bimekizumab was not associated with increases in injection site 
reactions or serious hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, the absolute number of cases remain small 
to draw any firm conclusions. Hence, the section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated to reflect that across all 
indications, an association between immunogenicity and TEAEs has not been clearly established. 
Study PA0012 open-label extension of up to 140 weeks (~2.7 years) which is still ongoing will assess the 
long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab; however, this may not be adequate to 
capture some rarer risks or risks with longer latency, i.e. malignancy. Longer term safety with BKZ will 
thus be assessed during the planned PASS PS0038 (see RMP).  
Noticeable differences in the incidence of SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation was noted when 
comparing between <65, and the >65 years age groups. There was wide variation in age subgroup sizes, 
with particularly low number of study participants in the over 75 to 84 years and ≥85 years age groups. 
The increase in SAEs is mainly attributed to disorders common in older people. Interpretation of this 
dataset is difficult due to the relatively small size of the dataset. The uncertainty around these findings is 
reflected in a new statement in Section 4.8 of the SmPC stating that exposure is limited in older patients. 
TEAEs leading to Permanent withdrawal of study medication due to TEAEs were also increased in the 
older age cohorts (<65yrs; 4.1% vs 65-74 yrs; 9.9% vs 75-84yrs; 6.3%). The commonest reason for 
withdrawal was oral candida. SmPC section 4.8 has also been updated to include warnings regarding 
increased reports of candida and dermatitis in older patients with PsA.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Bimekizumab has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in the 
extent and severity of active PsA in a TNFα-IR population (Study PA0011) as well as a bDMARD naïve 
patient population (Study PA0010). The clinical development program also included study participants 
who had no prior exposure to cDMARDs 35.5% or had exposure to 1 or more prior cDMARDs (62.4%) 
however a limitation of this clinical development programme is the proportion of subjects with exposure 
to CDMARDs other than methotrexate (9.3%). As a result, the indication was restricted to monotherapy 
or combination with methotrexate.  
The primary objective was met in both pivotal trials. In PA0010, Bimekizumab 160mg Q4W treatment 
demonstrated a superior ACR50 responder rate at Week 16 (the primary efficacy variable) compared with 
the placebo group (43.9% vs 10.0%, respectively). This difference is considered clinically meaningful, 
with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo of 7.082 (p<0.001). In PA0011, treatment with 
bimekizumab 160mg Q4W demonstrated a superior ACR50 responder rate at Week 16 (the primary 
efficacy variable) compared with the placebo group (43.4% vs 6.8%, respectively). This difference is also 
considered clinically meaningful, with a statistically significant odds ratio versus placebo of 11.086 
(p<0.001). The results of all supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable confirmed the primary 
efficacy results. Updated PA0010 Week 52 efficacy data demonstrated that efficacy outcomes achieved at 
Week 16 either continued to improve or were sustained up to 1 year (Week 52). 
PA0010 and PA0011 also met all the ranked secondary efficacy objectives. Additionally, numerically 
greater improvements compared with placebo were observed for the non-ranked secondary efficacy 
endpoints following bimekizumab treatment. The results of all supportive analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy variables confirmed the results of the primary analyses, and subgroup analyses 
demonstrated consistent efficacy over placebo at Week 16 across multiple subgroups, with the exception 
of the age and gender subgroups in the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies, for which efficacy appeared 
less pronounced in some subgroups, however further rationale was provided by the MAH. Although lower 
efficacy in joint outcomes was observed in females and older patients, efficacy observed was still clinically 
relevant as compared to placebo. In addition, this phenomenon indeed is not unique to bimekizumab and 
is well known in the literature in studies with other biologics in PsA. 
While there are a number of important identified and potential risks associated with bimekizumab, the 
current dataset in PsA patients is generally consistent with the previously known safety profile in PSO. No 
new safety issues have been identified during the review of this application. A number of post-
authorisation measures are in place for further characterisation of important identified and potential risks.

The Product Information has been adequately updated with new information on PsA and already includes 
adequate warnings and precautions regarding the management of these risks. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although the availability of treatment options has expanded over the years, there is still an unmet need 
for a treatment that provides clinically meaningful improvement in the extent and severity of active PsA. 
The results on bimekizumab monotherapy and combination therapy with MTW show robust efficacy of 
bimekizumab compared to placebo up to 52-weeks. Hence, both the indication for monotherapy and 
combination therapy with MTX are considered acceptable to the CHMP. Overall, the favourable effects 
outweigh the unfavourable effects.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bimzelx is positive in the following indication:  
‘Psoriatic arthritis 
Bimzelx, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).’

(DMARDs) for Bimzelx, based on results of a Phase III study in biological DMARD naïve study participants 
(PA0010; BE OPTIMAL) and a Phase III study in study participants who are inadequate responders 
(inadequate response or intolerant) to ≤2 prior TNF inhibitors (PA0011; BE COMPLETE). Both Phase III 
studies are interventional studies aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab. For PA0010, 
the Initial Treatment Period was placebo- and no inferential active reference (adalimumab)-controlled, 
while PA0011 was placebo-controlled. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 to 
the SmPC have been updated. The Package leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 1.7 is 
acceptable. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.2 rev.1. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

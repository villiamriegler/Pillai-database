CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone 
elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery. 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less than 
18 years of age. 
For age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Dabigatran etexilate Accord hard capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or 
older who are able to swallow the capsules whole. Other pharmaceutical forms may be more 
appropriate for administration to this population such as coated granules which can be used in children 
aged less than 12 years as soon as the child is able to swallow soft food. Other pharmaceutical forms 
such as powder and solvent for oral solution should only be used in children aged less than 1 year. 
When changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated 
in the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed based on the weight and age of the 
child. 
Primary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery 
The recommended doses of dabigatran etexilate and the duration of therapy for primary prevention of 
VTE in orthopaedic surgery are shown in table 1.

Patients who receive 
concomitant verapamil*, 
amiodarone, quinidine 
Patients aged 75 or above 
*For patients with moderate renal impairment concomitantly treated with verapamil see Special 
populations 
For both surgeries, if haemostasis is not secured, initiation of treatment should be delayed. If treatment 
is not started on the day of surgery then treatment should be initiated with 2 capsules once daily. 
Assessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment 
In all patients and especially in the elderly (> 75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this 
age group: 
- 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment 
(i.e. CrCL < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal 
products). 
- 
The method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method. 
Missed dose 
It is recommended to continue with the remaining daily doses of dabigatran etexilate at the same time 
of the next day. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be 
instructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as dyspepsia 
(see section 4.8). 
Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is recommended to wait 24 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL /min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min), a dose reduction is recommended 
(see table 1 above and sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. 
amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil 
Dosing should be reduced as indicated in table 1 (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation 
dabigatran etexilate and these medicinal products should be taken at the same time. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with verapamil, a dose reduction 
of dabigatran etexilate to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elderly 
For elderly patients > 75 years, a dose reduction is recommended (see table 1 above and sections 4.4 
and 5.1). 
Weight 
There is very limited clinical experience in patients with a body weight < 50 kg or > 110 kg at the 
recommended posology. Given the available clinical and kinetic data no adjustment is necessary (see 
section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Gender 
No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of 
primary prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or 
total knee replacement surgery. 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
For the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with 
a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be 
initiated following previous treatment. 
Dabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in 
the evening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 
12 hours as possible. 
The recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules is based on the patient’s weight and age as 
shown in table 2. The dose should be adjusted according to weight and age as treatment progresses. 
For weight and age combinations not listed in the dosing table no dosing recommendation can be

Assessment of renal function prior to and during treatment 
Prior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated 
using the Schwartz formula (method used for creatinine assessment to be checked with local lab). 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Patients with an eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 2. 
While on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected 
that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain 
co-medications, etc). 
Duration of use 
The duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment. 
Missed dose 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. 
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. 
A double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients or their 
caregivers should be instructed to contact the treating physician if the patient develops gastrointestinal 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms such as dyspepsia (see section 4.8). 
Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA): 
Patients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate. 
Because dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better 
reflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, 
INR values should be interpreted with caution. 
VKA to dabigatran etexilate: 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is < 2.0. 
Method of administration 
This medicinal product is for oral use. 
The capsules can be taken with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed as a whole with a 
glass of water, to facilitate delivery to the stomach. 
Patients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see 
sections 5.2 and 6.6).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhagic risk 
Dabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or 
with concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet aggregation.  
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or haematocrit 
or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
For adult patients in situations of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the 
anticoagulation effect of dabigatran is required, the specific reversal agent idarucizumab is available.  
The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. 
Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, 
coagulation factor concentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet 
concentrates are other possible options (see also section 4.9). 
Use of platelet aggregation inhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non 
steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or 
gastroesophageal reflux increase the risk of GI bleeding. 
Risk factors 
Table 3 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.

Limited data is available in adult patients < 50 kg (see section 5.2). 
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric 
patients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5). 
Precautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk 
For the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
The presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major 
bleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the 
benefit outweighs bleeding risks. 
Limited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with 
active meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran 
etexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks. 
Close clinical surveillance 
Close observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, 
especially if risk factors are combined (see table 3 above). Particular caution should be exercised when 
dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp 
inhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal 
function (see section 4.5). 
Close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
NSAIDs (see section 4.5). 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Patients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate (see also section 4.3). 
When severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated and 
use of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) may be considered in adult patients. The efficacy and 
safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove 
dabigatran. 
Use of proton-pump inhibitors 
The administration of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. In case 
of paediatric patients local labeling recommendations for proton pump inhibitors have to be followed. 
Laboratory coagulation parameters 
Although this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the 
measurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to 
dabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors. 
Diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test 
variability (see section 5.1). 
The international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false 
positive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. 
Table 4 shows coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding. Respective thresholds for paediatric patients are not known (see section 5.1)

Use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
The use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be 
considered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) according to the local reference range. 
Surgery and interventions 
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
Caution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and 
anticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency 
may take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such 
cases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still 
impaired. 
Emergency surgery or urgent procedures 
Dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. When rapid reversal of the anticoagulation 
effect is required the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran is available for adult 
patients. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients.  
Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran. 
Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if the 
patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved. 
Subacute surgery/interventions 
Dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery/intervention should be delayed if 
possible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding may 
be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. 
Elective surgery 
If possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical 
procedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may 
be required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery. 
Table 5 summarises discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients.

These patients have not been studied (see section 4.3). 
Spinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture 
Procedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function. 
The risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture 
and by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least 
2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients 
require frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma. 
Postoperative phase 
Dabigatran etexilate should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as 
possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has been established. 
Patients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with reduced renal 
function (see also table 3), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Patients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events 
There are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and 
therefore they should be treated with caution. 
Hip fracture surgery 
There is no data on the use of dabigatran etexilate in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. 
Therefore treatment is not recommended. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate 
is not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any 
impact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interaction with P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma 
concentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for 
patients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular 
for patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 
2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. 
Active cancer patients (paediatric VTE) 
There is limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer. 
Paediatric population 
For some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption 
may be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’ 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Transporter interactions 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp 
inhibitors (see table 7) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
If not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or 
anaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. Dose reductions 
may be required in combination with some P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Table 7: Transporter interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
Concomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) 
Ketoconazole 
Dronedarone 
Itraconazole, 
cyclosporine 
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values by 2.38-fold 
and 2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold 
and 2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole 
once daily. 
When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total 
dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, 
respectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone twice a day, and 
about 2.1-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg. 
Based on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. 
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of 
the P-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase 
exposure of dabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding.

Concomitant use not recommended 
Tacrolimus 
Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect 
on P-gp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate 
has not been clinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited 
clinical data with another P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the 
inhibition of P-gp with tacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong 
P-gp inhibitors. 
Cautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) 
Verapamil 
Amiodarone 
Quinidine 
Clarithromycin 
Ticagrelor 
When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, 
the Cmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this 
change differs depending on timing of administration and formulation of 
verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose 
of an immediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior 
to the dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC 
by about 2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration 
of an extended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and 
AUC by about 1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil 
(increase of Cmax by about 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold). 
There was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 
2 hours after dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC 
by about 1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 
2 hours. 
When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 
600 mg amiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its 
active metabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and 
Cmax were increased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the 
long half-life of amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks 
after discontinuation of amiodarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 
1 000 mg. Dabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, 
on the 3rd day either with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 
were increased on average by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with 
concomitant quinidine (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with 
dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold 
and Cmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. 
When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered 
simultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC 
and Cmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After 
multiple doses of ticagrelor 90 mg twice a day the increase of dabigatran 
exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-fold for Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
Concomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg 
dabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 
by 1.49-fold and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate 
given alone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 
110 mg dabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUCτ,ss 
and Cmax,ss was reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with 
dabigatran etexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended 
administration for start of ticagrelor with a loading dose. 
12 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor twice a day (maintenance dose) 
with 110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss 1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate 
given alone. 
Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically 
studied. Caution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-
administered with posaconazole. 
Posaconazole 
P-gp inducers 
Concomitant use should be avoided. 
e.g. rifampicin, St. 
John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), 
carbamazepine, or 
phenytoin 
Concomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran 
concentrations. 
Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 
7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 % and 67 %, 
respectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran 
exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. 
No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days. 
Protease inhibitors such as ritonavir 
Concomitant use not recommended 
e.g. ritonavir and its 
combinations with other 
protease inhibitors 
These affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied 
and are therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran 
etexilate. 
P-gp substrate 
Digoxin 
In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was 
co-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant 
changes on dabigatran exposure have been observed. 
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products 
There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of 
bleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated 
heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, 
desirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral 
anticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa 
receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4). 
UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or 
during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). 
Table 8: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products 
NSAIDs 
Clopidogrel 
NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with 
increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With 
chronic use in a phase III clinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke 
prevention in atrial fibrillation patients (RE-LY), NSAIDs increased the risk of 
bleeding by approximately 50 % on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. 
In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran 
etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding 
times compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss and the coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of 
platelet aggregation as measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ASA 
LMWH 
unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective mono-treatments. 
With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,s were increased by about 30-40 % (see section 4.4) . 
Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may 
increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 24 % with 81 mg and 
325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4). 
The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has 
not been specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once 
daily 40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the 
exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of 
dabigatran etexilate (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity 
was observed after dabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-
treatment compared to that after treatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is 
considered to be due to the carry-over effect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded 
as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-coagulation tests were not 
changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin. 
Other interactions 
Table 9: Other interactions 
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs) 
SSRIs, SNRIs 
SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in all treatment groups of a 
phase III clinical trial comparing dabigatran to warfarin for stroke prevention in 
atrial fibrillation patients (RE-LY). 
Substances influencing gastric pH 
Pantoprazole 
Ranitidine 
When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in 
the dabigatran AUC of approximately 30 % was observed. Pantoprazole and other 
proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with dabigatran etexilate in 
clinical trials, and concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy 
of dabigatran etexilate. 
Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically 
relevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran. 
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile 
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Pregnancy 
There is limited amount of data from the use of dabigatran etexilate in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dabigatran etexilate should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Fertility 
No human data available. 
In animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations 
and an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure 
level compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence 
on male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5-to 10-fold higher plasma 
exposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an 
increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre-and post-natal study, an 
increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to 
a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Dabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Dabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64 000 patients; 
thereof approximately 35 000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate. 
In actively controlled VTE prevention trials 6 684 patients were treated with 150 mg or 220 mg 
dabigatran etexilate daily. 
The most commonly reported events are bleedings occurring in approximately 14 % of patients; the 
frequency of major bleeds (including wound site bleedings) is less than 2 %. 
Although rare in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of 
location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.

Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of dabigatran etexilate may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ. The signs, symptoms, and severity 
(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding 
and/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were 
seen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. 
Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of 
value to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. 
those patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis 
or strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may 
present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and 
unexplained shock. 
Known bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to 
hypoperfusion and anticoagulant-related nephropathy in patients with predisposing risk factors have 
been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in 
evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. For adult patients, a specific reversal agent for 
dabigatran, idarucizumab, is available in case of uncontrollable bleeding (see Section 4.9). 
The table 11 shows the number (%) of patients experiencing the adverse reaction bleeding during the 
treatment period in the indication primary VTE prevention after hip or knee replacement surgery in the 
two pivotal clinical trials, according to dose.

Agranulocytosis and neutropenia 
Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported very rarely during post approval use of 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dabigatran etexilate. Because adverse reactions are reported in the postmarketing surveillance setting 
from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably determine their frequency. The 
reporting rate was estimated as 7 events per 1 million patient years for agranulocytosis and as 5 events 
per 1 million patient years for neutropenia. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients was studied in two phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1 160.108). In total, 328 
paediatric patients had been treated with dabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and weight 
adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate. 
Overall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults. 
In total, 26 % of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of 
recurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 12 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and 
prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ 
Class (SOC) and frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100

In the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1 %) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5 %) a 
clinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9 %) a minor bleeding event. The 
frequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to < 18 years: 28.6 %) than 
in the younger age groups (birth to < 2 years: 23.3 %; 2 to < 12 years: 16.2 %). Major or severe 
bleeding, regardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Dabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of 
bleeding. 
In case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow 
prediction of the time by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case 
additional measures e.g. dialysis have been initiated. 
Excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran 
is excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding 
is low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this 
approach in clinical studies (see section 5.2). 
Management of bleeding complications 
In the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and 
the source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive 
treatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the 
prescriber’s discretion. 
For adult patients in situations when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is required 
the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran is 
available. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients (see 
section 4.4). 
Coagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken 
into account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in 
reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and 
also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become 
unreliable following administration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be 
exercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of 
platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal 
products have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's 
judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07. 
Mechanism of action 
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma. 
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral 
administration in various animal models of thrombosis. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant 
effect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT. 
The calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma 
concentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the 
calibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of 
quantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered. 
The ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors. 
The aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation 
intensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable 
for precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value 
indicates that the patient is anticoagulated. 
In general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran 
levels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile 
of dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough (for aPTT 
thresholds see section 4.4, table 4) is considered to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Primary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery 
Steady state (after day 3) geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 
2 hours after 220 mg dabigatran etexilate administration, was 70.8 ng/mL, with a range of 
35.2-162 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range).The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, 
measured at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 24 hours after a 220 mg dabigatran dose), was on 
average 22.0 ng/mL, with a range of 13.0-35.7 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). 
In a dedicated study exclusively in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance, 
CrCL 30-50 mL/min) treated with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg QD, the dabigatran geometric mean 
trough concentration, measured at the end of the dosing interval, was on average 47.5 ng/mL, with a 
range of 29.6-72.2 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). 
In patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery with 220 mg 
dabigatran etexilate once daily, 
• 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations was 67 ng/mL, measured at trough 
(20-28 hours after the previous dose) (see section 4.4 and 4.9), 
the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (20-28 hours after the previous dose) was 51 seconds, 
which would be 1.3-fold upper limit of normal. 
• 
The ECT was not measured in patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement 
surgery with 220 mg dabigatran etexilate once daily. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or 
Chinese patients were observed. 
Clinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery 
In 2 large randomised, parallel group, double-blind, dose-confirmatory trials, patients undergoing 
elective major orthopaedic surgery (one for knee replacement surgery and one for hip replacement 
surgery) received 75 mg or 110 mg dabigatran etexilate within 1-4 hours of surgery followed by 
150 mg or 220 mg once daily thereafter, haemostasis having been secured, or enoxaparin 40 mg on the 
day prior to surgery and daily thereafter. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the RE-MODEL trial (knee replacement) treatment was for 6-10 days and in the RE-NOVATE trial 
(hip replacement) for 28-35 days. Totals of 2 076 patients (knee) and 3 494 (hip) were treated 
respectively. 
Composite of total VTE (including pulmonary embolism (PE), proximal and distal deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), whatever symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and all-
cause mortality constituted the primary end-point for both studies. Composite of major VTE (including 
PE and proximal DVT, whatever symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and 
VTE-related mortality constituted a secondary end-point and is considered of better clinical relevance. 
Results of both studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of 220 mg and 150 mg dabigatran 
etexilate were statistically non-inferior to that of enoxaparin on total VTE and all-cause mortality. The 
point estimate for incidence of major VTE and VTE related mortality for the 150 mg dose was slightly 
worse than enoxaparin (table 13). Better results were seen with the 220 mg dose where the point 
estimate of Major VTE was slightly better than enoxaparin (table 13). 
The clinical studies have been conducted in a patient population with a mean age > 65 years. 
There were no differences in the phase 3 clinical studies for efficacy and safety data between men and 
women. 
In the studied patient population of RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE (5 539 patients treated), 51 % 
suffered from concomitant hypertension, 9 % from concomitant diabetes, 9 % from concomitant 
coronary artery disease and 20 % had a history of venous insufficiency. None of these diseases showed 
an impact on the effects of dabigatran on VTE-prevention or bleeding rates. 
Data for the major VTE and VTE-related mortality endpoint were homogeneous with regards to the 
primary efficacy endpoint and are shown in table 13. 
Data for the total VTE and all cause mortality endpoint are shown in table 14. 
Data for adjudicated major bleeding endpoints are shown in table 15 below.

Clinical trials for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves 
A phase II study examined dabigatran etexilate and warfarin in a total of 252 patients with recent 
mechanical valve replacement surgery (i.e. within the current hospital stay) and in patients who 
received a mechanical heart valve replacement more than three months ago. More thromboembolic 
events (mainly strokes and symptomatic/asymptomatic prosthetic valve thrombosis) and more 
bleeding events were observed with dabigatran etexilate than with warfarin. In the early post-operative 
patients, major bleeding manifested predominantly as haemorrhagic pericardial effusions, specifically 
in patients who started dabigatran etexilate early (i.e. on Day 3) after heart valve replacement surgery 
(see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
Clinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing dabigatran etexilate in all subsets of the paediatric population 
in prevention of thromboembolic events for the indication of primary prevention of VTE in patients 
who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
The DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate 
compared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less 
than 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, 
non-inferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an 
age-appropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or vitamin 
K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a composite 
endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom 
from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and 
intracranial abscess. 
In total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran 
etexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were 
12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than 
2 years. 
Of the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients 
(42.2 %) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus 
resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The 
corresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent 
results were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the 
treatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the 
3 different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the 
dabigatran etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1 %) and 7/13 (53.8 %) for patients 
from birth to < 2 years, 21/43 (48.8 %) and 12/21 (57.1 %) for patients aged 2 to < 12 years, and 
47/112 (42.0 %) and 19/56 (33.9 %) for patients aged 12 to < 18 years. 
Adjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 
2 patients (2.2 %) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first 
major bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6 %) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients 
(24.4 %) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The 
combined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major 
(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4 %) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group 
and 3 (3.3 %) patients in the SOC group. 
An open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1 160.108) was 
conducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the 
presence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least 
3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. 
Eligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, 
coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a 
maximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major 
and minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic 
events) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication 
committee. 
Overall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less than 
18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients in age 
stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4 %) 
had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start.  
Adjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients 
(22.5 %) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients 
(1.4 %), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For 
3 patients (1.4 %), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months.  
No on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4 %) developed 
post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, 
which is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by esterase-
catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. The 
absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of dabigatran etexilate was 
approximately 6.5 %. 
After oral administration of dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of 
dabigatran in plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained 
within 0.5 and 2.0 hours post administration. 
Absorption 
A study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, 
demonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth 
plasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to 
contributing factors such as anaesthesia, gastrointestinal paresis, and surgical effects independent of 
the oral medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed 
absorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran 
is rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration. 
Food does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma 
concentrations by 2 hours. 
Cmax and AUC were dose proportional. 
The oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % after a single dose and 37 % at steady state 
compared to the reference capsule formulation when the pellets are taken without the 
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, the integrity of the HPMC capsules 
should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally increased bioavailability of 
dabigatran etexilate (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was 
observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60–70 L exceeded the volume of total body 
water indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived 
radioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the 
administered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose 
by 168 hours post dose. 
Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four 
positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical 
methods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of 
approximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate. 
Elimination 
Plasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was 
observed. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as 
shown in table 16. 
Special populations 
Renal insufficiency 
In phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran 
etexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL 
between 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency. 
In a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the 
exposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately 
2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 
and 4.4).

function.

27.2 (15.3 %; 21.6-35.0) 
Additionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label 
randomised pharmacokinetic study in NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (defined as 
creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 75 mg twice daily. This 
regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9 %), measured 
immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak concentration of 
202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6 %) measured two hours after the administration of the last dose. 
Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 adult patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow 
rate, four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted 
in a removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance 
cleared by dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The 
anticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD 
relationship was not affected by the procedure. 
Elderly patients 
Specific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the 
AUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects. 
The effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % 
higher trough concentration for subjects ≥ 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects 
< 65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency 
(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Body weight 
The dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in adult patients with a body weight 
> 100 kg compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ≥ 50 kg and 
< 100 kg category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in 
adult patients < 50 kg are available. 
Gender 
Active substance exposure in the primary VTE prevention studies was about 40 % to 50 % higher in 
female patients and no dose adjustment is recommended. 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Paediatric population 
Oral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted 
in exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT/PE. Based on the pooled analysis of 
pharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1 160.108, the observed geometric mean trough 
exposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to < 2-year-old, 2 to < 12-year-old and 
12 to < 18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
In vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of 
cytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not 
show any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin 
(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of dabigatran. 
An effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in 
pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were 
toxic to the mothers (5-to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body 
weight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the 
pre-and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the 
dams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
In a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding 
events at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile 
rats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in 
association with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile 
toxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to 
juvenile animals. 
In lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of 
dabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone 
elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); age 
≥ 75 years; heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II); diabetes mellitus; hypertension. 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less than 
18 years of age. 
For age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Dabigatran etexilate Accord hard capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or 
older who are able to swallow the capsules whole. Other pharmaceutical forms may be more 
appropriate for administration to this population such as coated granules which can be used in children 
aged less than 12 years as soon as the child is able to swallow soft food. Other pharmaceutical forms 
such as powder and solvent for oral solution should only be used in children aged less than 1 year. 
When changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated 
in the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed based on the weight and age of the 
child.

50 mL/min) 
Patients who receive 
concomitant verapamil*, 
amiodarone, quinidine 
Patients aged 75 or above 
*For patients with moderate renal impairment concomitantly treated with verapamil see Special 
populations 
For both surgeries, if haemostasis is not secured, initiation of treatment should be delayed. If treatment 
is not started on the day of surgery then treatment should be initiated with 2 capsules once daily. 
Assessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment 
In all patients and especially in the elderly (> 75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this 
age group: 
• 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment 
(i.e. CrCL < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal 
products). 
• 
The method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method. 
Missed dose 
It is recommended to continue with the remaining daily doses of dabigatran etexilate at the same time 
of the next day. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be 
instructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as dyspepsia 
(see section 4.8).

Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
It is recommended to wait 24 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min), a dose reduction is recommended 
(see table 1 above and sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. 
amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil 
Dosing should be reduced as indicated in table 1 (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation 
dabigatran etexilate and these medicinal products should be taken at the same time. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment and concomitantly treated with verapamil, a dose reduction 
of dabigatran etexilate to 75 mg daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Elderly 
For elderly patients > 75 years, a dose reduction is recommended (see table 1 above and sections 4.4 
and 5.1). 
Weight 
There is very limited clinical experience in patients with a body weight < 50 kg or > 110 kg at the 
recommended posology. Given the available clinical and kinetic data no adjustment is necessary (see 
section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Gender 
No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of 
primary prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or 
total knee replacement surgery. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk 
factors (SPAF)

daily dose of dabigatran etexilate of 300 mg or 
220 mg should be selected based on an 
individual assessment of the thromboembolic 
risk and the risk of bleeding 
For DVT/PE the recommendation for the use of 220 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 110 mg 
capsule twice daily is based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses and has not been 
studied in this clinical setting. See further down and sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2. 
In case of intolerability to dabigatran etexilate, patients should be instructed to immediately consult 
their treating physician in order to be switched to alternate acceptable treatment options for prevention 
of stroke and systemic embolism associated with atrial fibrillation or for DVT/PE. 
Assessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment 
In all patients and especially in the elderly (> 75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this 
age group: 
• 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment 
(i.e. CrCL < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal 
products). 
• 
Additional requirements in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and in patients aged over 
75 years: 
• 
Renal function should be assessed during treatment with dabigatran etexilate at least once a year 
or more frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal 
function could decline or deteriorate (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of 
concomitant use of certain medicinal products). 
The method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method. 
Duration of use 
The duration of use of dabigatran etexilate in the indications SPAF, DVT and PE are shown in table 3.

Table 3: Duration of use for SPAF and DVT/PE 
Indication 
Duration of use 
SPAF 
DVT/PE 
Therapy should be continued long term. 
The duration of therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of 
the treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). 
Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk 
factors (e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation) and longer durations 
should be based on permanent risk factors or idiopathic DVT or PE. 
Missed dose 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose.  
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose on, the missed dose should be omitted. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be 
instructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as dyspepsia 
(see section 4.8). 
Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA): 
The starting time of the VKA should be adjusted based on CrCL as follows: 
• 
• 
CrCL ≥ 50 mL/min, VKA should be started 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate 
CrCL ≥ 30 < 50 mL/min, VKA should be started 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran 
etexilate 
Because dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better 
reflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, 
INR values should be interpreted with caution. 
VKA to dabigatran etexilate: 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is < 2.0. 
Cardioversion (SPAF) 
Patients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. 
Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (SPAF) 
There are no data available for 110 mg twice daily dabigatran etexilate treatment. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting (SPAF) 
Patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo a PCI with stenting can be treated with 
dabigatran etexilate in combination with antiplatelets after haemostasis is achieved (see section 5.1). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
For dose modifications in this population see table 2 above. 
Patients at risk of bleeding 
Patients with an increased bleeding risk (see sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2) should be closely monitored 
clinically (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia). Dose adjustment should be decided at the 
discretion of the physician, following assessment of the potential benefit and risk to an individual 
patient (see table 2 above). A coagulation test (see section 4.4) may help to identify patients with an 
increased bleeding risk caused by excessive dabigatran exposure. When excessive dabigatran exposure 
is identified in patients at high risk of bleeding, a reduced dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule 
twice daily is recommended. When clinically relevant bleeding occurs, treatment should be 
interrupted. 
For subjects with gastritis, esophagitis, or gastroesophageal reflux, a dose reduction may be considered 
due to the elevated risk of major gastro-intestinal bleeding (see table 2 above and section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCL 50 ≤ 80 mL/min). For 
patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) the recommended dose of dabigatran 
etexilate is also 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. However, for patients with high risk 
of bleeding, a dose reduction of dabigatran etexilate to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice 
daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in 
patients with renal impairment. 
Concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. 
amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil 
No dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of amiodarone or quinidine (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.2). 
Dose reductions are recommended for patients who receive concomitantly verapamil (see table 2 
above and sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation dabigatran etexilate and verapamil should be taken at 
the same time. 
Weight 
No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended in 
patients with a body weight < 50 kg (see section 4.4). 
Gender 
No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of 
prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF. 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
For the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be 
initiated following previous treatment. 
Dabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in 
the evening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 
12 hours as possible. 
The recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules is based on the patient’s weight and age as 
shown in table 4. The dose should be adjusted according to weight and age as treatment progresses. 
For weight and age combinations not listed in the dosing table no dosing recommendation can be 
provided.

Assessment of renal function prior to and during treatment 
Prior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated 
using the Schwartz formula (method used for creatinine assessment to be checked with local lab). 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Patients with an eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 4. 
While on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected 
that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain 
co-medications, etc). 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of use 
The duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment. 
Missed dose 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. 
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. 
A double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients or their 
caregivers should be instructed to contact the treating physician if the patient develops gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as dyspepsia (see section 4.8). 
Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA): 
Patients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate. 
Because dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better 
reflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, 
INR values should be interpreted with caution. 
VKA to dabigatran etexilate: 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is < 2.0. 
Method of administration 
This medicinal product is for oral use. 
The capsules can be taken with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed as a whole with a 
glass of water, to facilitate delivery to the stomach. 
Patients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see 
sections 5.2 and 6.6).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhagic risk 
Dabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or 
with concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet aggregation.  
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or haematocrit 
or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
For adult patients in situations of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the 
anticoagulation effect of dabigatran is required, the specific reversal agent idarucizumab is available. 
The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. 
Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, 
coagulation factor concentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet 
concentrates are other possible options (see also section 4.9). 
In clinical trials, dabigatran etexilate was associated with higher rates of major gastrointestinal (GI) 
bleeding. An increased risk was seen in the elderly (≥ 75 years) for the 150 mg twice daily dose 
regimen. Further risk factors (see also table 5) comprise co-medication with platelet aggregation 
inhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
(NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux. 
Risk factors 
Table 5 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.

• 
• 
Limited data is available in adult patients < 50 kg (see section 5.2). 
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric 
patients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5). 
Precautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk 
For the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
The presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major 
bleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the 
benefit outweighs bleeding risks. 
Limited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with 
active meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran 
etexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks. 
Close clinical surveillance 
Close observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, 
especially if risk factors are combined (see table 5 above). Particular caution should be exercised when 
dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp 
inhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal 
function (see section 4.5). 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
NSAIDs (see section 4.5). 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Patients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate (see also section 4.3). 
When severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated and 
use of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) may be considered in adult patients. The efficacy and 
safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove 
dabigatran. 
Use of proton-pump inhibitors  
The administration of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. In case 
of paediatric patients local labeling recommendations for proton pump inhibitors have to be followed. 
Laboratory coagulation parameters 
Although this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the 
measurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to 
dabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors. 
Diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test 
variability (see section 5.1). 
The international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false 
positive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. 
Table 6 shows coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding. Respective thresholds for paediatric patients are not known (see section 5.1) 
Table 6: Coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding.

Use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
The use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be 
considered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) according to the local reference range. 
Surgery and interventions 
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
Patients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. There are no data available for 
110 mg twice daily dabigatran etexilate treatment in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial 
fibrillation (see section 4.2). 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and 
anticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency 
may take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such 
cases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still 
impaired. 
Emergency surgery or urgent procedures 
Dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. When rapid reversal of the anticoagulation 
effect is required the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran is available for adult 
patients. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients.  
Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran. 
Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if the 
patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved. 
Subacute surgery/interventions 
Dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery/intervention should be delayed if 
possible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding may 
be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. 
Elective surgery 
If possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical 
procedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may 
be required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery.

Spinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture 
Procedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function. 
The risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture 
and by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least 
2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients 
require frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma. 
Postoperative phase 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should be resumed/started after the invasive procedure or surgical 
intervention as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has 
been established. 
Patients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with reduced renal 
function (see also table 5), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Patients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events 
There are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and 
therefore they should be treated with caution. 
Hip fracture surgery 
There is no data on the use of dabigatran etexilate in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. 
Therefore treatment is not recommended. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate 
is not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any 
impact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Interaction with P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma 
concentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for 
patients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular 
for patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 
2glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. 
Myocardial Infarction (MI) 
In the phase III study RE-LY (SPAF, see section 5.1) the overall rate of MI was 0.82, 0.81, and 
0.64 %/year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily and 
warfarin, respectively, an increase in relative risk for dabigatran of 29 % and 27 % compared to 
warfarin. Irrespective of therapy, the highest absolute risk of MI was seen in the following subgroups, 
with similar relative risk: patients with previous MI, patients ≥ 65 years with either diabetes or 
coronary artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, and patients with 
moderate renal dysfunction. Furthermore a higher risk of MI was seen in patients concomitantly taking 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ASA plus clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone. 
In the three active controlled DVT/PE phase III studies, a higher rate of MI was reported in patients 
who received dabigatran etexilate than in those who received warfarin: 0.4 % vs. 0.2 % in the short 
term RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies; and 0.8 % vs. 0.1 % in the long-term RE-MEDY trial. 
The increase was statistically significant in this study (p= 0.022). 
In the RE-SONATE study, which compared dabigatran etexilate to placebo, the rate of MI was 0.1 % 
for patients who received dabigatran etexilate and 0.2 % for patients who received placebo. 
Active cancer patients (DVT/PE, paediatric VTE) 
The efficacy and safety have not been established for DVT/PE patients with active cancer. There is 
limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer. 
Paediatric population 
For some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption 
may be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered. 
Excipients

essentially ‘sodium free’ 
4.5 
 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Transporter interactions 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp 
inhibitors (see table 9) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
If not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or 
anaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. Dose reductions 
may be required in combination with some P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Table 9: Transporter interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
Concomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) 
Ketoconazole 
Dronedarone 
Itraconazole, 
cyclosporine 
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values by 2.38-fold 
and 2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold 
and 2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg ketoconazole 
once daily. 
When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total 
dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, 
respectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone twice a day, and 
about 2.1-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg. 
Based on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be expected. 
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination of 
the P-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase 
exposure of dabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Concomitant use not recommended 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tacrolimus 
Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect 
on P gp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate 
has not been clinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited 
clinical data with another P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the 
inhibition of P-gp with tacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong 
P-gp inhibitors. 
Cautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) 
Verapamil 
Amiodarone 
Quinidine 
Clarithromycin 
Ticagrelor 
When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, 
the Cmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this 
change differs depending on timing of administration and formulation of 
verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose 
of an immediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior 
to the dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC 
by about 2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration 
of an extended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and 
AUC by about 1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil 
(increase of Cmax by about 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold). 
There was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 
2 hours after dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC 
by about 1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 
2 hours. 
When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 
600 mg amiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its 
active metabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and 
Cmax were increased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of the 
long half-life of amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks 
after discontinuation of amiodarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 
1 000 mg. Dabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, 
on the 3rd day either with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 
were increased on average by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with 
concomitant quinidine (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with 
dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold 
and Cmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. 
When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered 
simultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC 
and Cmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After 
multiple doses of ticagrelor 90 mg twice a day the increase of dabigatran 
exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-fold for Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
Concomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 110 mg 
dabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 
by 1.49-fold and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate 
given alone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 2 hours after 
110 mg dabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of dabigatran AUCτ,ss 
and Cmax,ss was reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, respectively, compared with 
dabigatran etexilate given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended 
administration for start of ticagrelor with a loading dose. 
44 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor twice a day (maintenance dose) 
with 110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss 1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate 
given alone. 
Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically 
studied. Caution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-
administered with posaconazole. 
Posaconazole 
P-gp inducers 
Concomitant use should be avoided. 
e.g. rifampicin, St. 
John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), 
carbamazepine, or 
phenytoin 
Concomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran 
concentrations. 
Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 
7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 % and 67 %, 
respectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran 
exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. 
No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days. 
Protease inhibitors such as ritonavir 
Concomitant use not recommended 
e.g. ritonavir and its 
combinations with other 
protease inhibitors 
These affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied 
and are therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with dabigatran 
etexilate. 
P-gp substrate 
Digoxin 
In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was 
co-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically relevant 
changes on dabigatran exposure have been observed. 
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products 
There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of 
bleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated 
heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, 
desirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral 
anticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa 
receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4). 
From the data collected in the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1) it was observed that the 
concomitant use of other oral or parenteral anticoagulants increases major bleeding rates with both 
dabigatran etexilate and warfarin by approximately 2.5-fold, mainly related to situations when 
switching from one anticoagulant to another (see section 4.3). Furthermore, concomitant use of 
antiplatelets, ASA or clopidogrel approximately doubled major bleeding rates with both dabigatran 
etexilate and warfarin (see section 4.4). 
UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or 
during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). 
Table 10: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products 
NSAIDs 
NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with 
increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With 
chronic use in the RE-LY study, NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clopidogrel 
ASA 
LMWH 
approximately 50 % on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. 
In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran 
etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding 
times compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss and the coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of 
platelet aggregation as measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially 
unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective mono-treatments. 
With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,s were increased by about 30-40 % (see section 4.4) . 
Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may 
increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 24 % with 81 mg and 
325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4). 
The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has 
not been specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once 
daily 40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the 
exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of 
dabigatran etexilate (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity 
was observed after dabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-
treatment compared to that after treatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is 
considered to be due to the carry-over effect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded 
as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-coagulation tests were not 
changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin. 
Other interactions 
Table 11: Other interactions 
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs) 
SSRIs, SNRIs 
Substances influencing gastric pH 
SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups, 
Pantoprazole 
Ranitidine 
When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in 
the dabigatran AUC of approximately 30 % was observed. Pantoprazole and other 
proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with dabigatran etexilate in 
clinical trials, and concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy 
of dabigatran etexilate. 
Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically 
relevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran. 
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile 
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Pregnancy 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is limited amount of data from the use of dabigatran etexilate in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Dabigatran etexilate should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding.  
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Fertility 
No human data available. 
In animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations 
and an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure 
level compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence 
on male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5-to 10-fold higher plasma 
exposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an 
increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre-and post-natal study, an 
increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to 
a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Dabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Dabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64 000 patients; 
thereof approximately 35 000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate. 
In total, about 9 % of patients treated for elective hip or knee surgery (short-term treatment for up to 
42 days), 22 % of patients with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism (long-term treatment for up to 3 years), 14 % of patients treated for DVT/PE and 15 % of 
patients treated for DVT/PE prevention experienced adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported events are bleedings occurring in approximately 14 % of patients treated 
short-term for elective hip or knee replacement surgery, 16.6 % in patients with atrial fibrillation 
treated long-term for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, and in 14.4 % of adult patients 
treated for DVT/PE. Furthermore, bleeding occurred in 19.4 % of patients in the DVT/PE prevention 
trial RE-MEDY (adult patients) and in 10.5 % of patients in the DVT/PE prevention trial 
RE-SONATE (adult patients). 
Since the patient populations treated in the three indications are not comparable and bleeding events 
are distributed over several System Organ Classes (SOC), a summary description of major and any 
bleeding are broken down by indication and provided in tables 13-17 below. 
Although low in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of 
location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.

Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of dabigatran etexilate may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ. The signs, symptoms, and severity 
(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding 
and/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were 
seen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. 
Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of 
value to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. 
those patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis 
or strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may 
present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and 
unexplained shock. 
Known bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to 
hypoperfusion and anticoagulant-related nephropathy in patients with predisposing risk factors have 
been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in 
evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. For adult patients a specific reversal agent for 
dabigatran, idarucizumab, is available in case of uncontrollable bleeding (see Section 4.9).

Subjects randomised to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily had a 
significantly lower risk for life-threatening bleeds and intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin 
[p < 0.05]. Both dose strengths of dabigatran etexilate had also a statistically significant lower total 
bleed rate. Subjects randomised to 110 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly lower 
risk for major bleeds compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.81 [p=0.0027]). Subjects randomised to 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly higher risk for major GI bleeds compared 
with warfarin (hazard ratio 1.48 [p=0.0005]. This effect was seen primarily in patients ≥ 75 years. 
The clinical benefit of dabigatran with regard to stroke and systemic embolism prevention and 
decreased risk of ICH compared to warfarin is preserved across individual subgroups, e.g. renal 
impairment, age, concomitant medicinal product use such as anti-platelets or P-gp inhibitors. While 
certain patient subgroups are at an increased risk of major bleeding when treated with an 
anticoagulant, the excess bleeding risk for dabigatran is due to GI bleeding, typically seen within the 
first 3-6 months following initiation of dabigatran etexilate therapy.

after the parenteral therapy has been discontinued (oral only treatment period). This includes all 
bleeding events, which occurred during dabigatran etexilate therapy. All bleeding events which 
occurred during warfarin therapy are included except for those during the overlap period between 
warfarin and parenteral therapy.

Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported very rarely during post approval use of 
dabigatran etexilate. Because adverse reactions are reported in the postmarketing surveillance setting 
from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably determine their frequency. The 
reporting rate was estimated as 7 events per 1 million patient years for agranulocytosis and as 5 events 
per 1 million patient years for neutropenia. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients was studied in two phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1 160.108). In total, 
328 paediatric patients had been treated with dabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and 
weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate. 
Overall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults. 
In total, 26 % of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of 
recurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 18 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and 
prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ 
Class (SOC) and frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 
to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000),

Bleeding reactions 
In the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1 %) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5 %) a 
clinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9 %) a minor bleeding event. The 
frequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to < 18 years: 28.6 %) than 
in the younger age groups (birth to < 2 years: 23.3 %; 2 to < 12 years: 16.2 %). Major or severe 
bleeding, regardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Dabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of 
bleeding. 
In case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow 
prediction of the time by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case 
additional measures e.g. dialysis have been initiated. 
Excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran 
is excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding 
is low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this 
approach in clinical studies (see section 5.2). 
Management of bleeding complications 
In the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and 
the source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive 
treatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the 
prescriber’s discretion. 
For adult patients in situations when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is required 
the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran is 
available. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients (see 
section 4.4). 
Coagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken 
into account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in 
reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and 
also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become 
unreliable following administration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be 
exercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of 
platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal 
products have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's 
judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07. 
Mechanism of action 
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma. 
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral 
administration in various animal models of thrombosis. 
There is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant 
effect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT. 
The calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma 
concentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the 
calibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of 
quantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered. 
The ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors. 
The aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation 
intensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable 
for precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value 
indicates that the patient is anticoagulated. 
In general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran 
levels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile 
of dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough (for aPTT 
thresholds see section 4.4, table 6) is considered to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Primary prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery 
Steady state (after day 3) geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 
2 hours after 220 mg dabigatran etexilate administration, was 70.8 ng/mL, with a range of 
35.2-162 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range).The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, 
measured at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 24 hours after a 220 mg dabigatran dose), was on 
average 22.0 ng/mL, with a range of 13.0-35.7 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). 
In a dedicated study exclusively in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance, 
CrCL 30-50 mL/min) treated with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg QD, the dabigatran geometric mean 
trough concentration, measured at the end of the dosing interval, was on average 47.5 ng/mL, with a 
range of 29.6-72.2 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). 
In patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement surgery with 220 mg

dabigatran etexilate once daily, 
• 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations was 67 ng/mL, measured at trough 
(20-28 hours after the previous dose) (see section 4.4 and 4.9), 
the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (20-28 hours after the previous dose) was 51 seconds, 
which would be 1.3-fold upper limit of normal. 
• 
The ECT was not measured in patients treated for prevention of VTEs after hip or knee replacement 
surgery with 220 mg dabigatran etexilate once daily. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors 
(SPAF) 
Steady state geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 2 hours after 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate administration twice daily, was 175 ng/mL, with a range of 
117-275 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, 
measured at trough in the morning, at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg 
dabigatran evening dose), was on average 91.0 ng/mL, with a range of 61.0-143 ng/mL (25th-75th 
percentile range). 
For patients with NVAF treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism with 150 mg 
dabigatran etexilate twice daily, 
• 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after the 
previous dose) was about 200 ng/mL, 
an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 3-fold upper limit 
of normal refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 103 seconds, 
an aPTT ratio greater than 2-fold upper limit of normal (aPTT prolongation of about 80 seconds), 
at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) reflects the 90th percentile of observations. 
• 
• 
Treatment of DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE) 
In patients treated for DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily, the dabigatran 
geometric mean trough concentration, measured within 10−16 hours after dose, at the end of the 
dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran evening dose), was 59.7 ng/ml, with a range 
of 38.6-94.5 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range). For treatment of DVT and PE, with dabigatran etexilate 
150 mg twice daily, 
• 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after the 
previous dose) was about 146 ng/ml, 
an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 2.3-fold 
compared to baseline refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 74 seconds, 
the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) was 62 seconds, 
which would be 1.8-fold compared to baseline. 
• 
• 
In patients treated for prevention of recurrent of DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice 
daily no pharmacokinetic data are available. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or 
Chinese patients were observed. 
Clinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery 
In 2 large randomised, parallel group, double-blind, dose-confirmatory trials, patients undergoing 
elective major orthopaedic surgery (one for knee replacement surgery and one for hip replacement 
surgery) received 75 mg or 110 mg dabigatran etexilate within 1-4 hours of surgery followed by 
150 mg or 220 mg once daily thereafter, haemostasis having been secured, or enoxaparin 40 mg on the 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
day prior to surgery and daily thereafter. 
In the RE-MODEL trial (knee replacement) treatment was for 6-10 days and in the RE-NOVATE trial 
(hip replacement) for 28-35 days. Totals of 2 076 patients (knee) and 3 494 (hip) were treated 
respectively. 
Composite of total VTE (including PE, proximal and distal DVT, whatever symptomatic or 
asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and all-cause mortality constituted the primary end-
point for both studies. Composite of major VTE (including PE and proximal DVT, whatever 
symptomatic or asymptomatic detected by routine venography) and VTE-related mortality constituted 
a secondary end-point and is considered of better clinical relevance. 
Results of both studies showed that the antithrombotic effect of 220 mg and 150 mg dabigatran 
etexilate were statistically non-inferior to that of enoxaparin on total VTE and all-cause mortality. The 
point estimate for incidence of major VTE and VTE related mortality for the 150 mg dose was slightly 
worse than enoxaparin (table 19). Better results were seen with the 220 mg dose where the point 
estimate of Major VTE was slightly better than enoxaparin (table 19). 
The clinical studies have been conducted in a patient population with a mean age > 65 years. 
There were no differences in the phase 3 clinical studies for efficacy and safety data between men and 
women. 
In the studied patient population of RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE (5 539 patients treated), 51 % 
suffered from concomitant hypertension, 9 % from concomitant diabetes, 9 % from concomitant 
coronary artery disease and 20 % had a history of venous insufficiency. None of these diseases showed 
an impact on the effects of dabigatran on VTE-prevention or bleeding rates. 
Data for the major VTE and VTE-related mortality endpoint were homogeneous with regards to the 
primary efficacy endpoint and are shown in table 19. 
Data for the total VTE and all cause mortality endpoint are shown in table 20. 
Data for adjudicated major bleeding endpoints are shown in table 21 below.

Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors 
The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate is derived from the RE-LY study 
(Randomised Evaluation of Long–term anticoagulant therapy) a multi-centre, multi-national, 
randomised parallel group study of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110 mg and 150 mg 
twice daily) compared to open-label warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk 
of stroke and systemic embolism. The primary objective in this study was to determine if dabigatran 
etexilate was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint stroke and 
systemic embolism. Statistical superiority was also analysed. 
In the RE-LY study, a total of 18 113 patients were randomised, with a mean age of 71.5 years and a 
mean CHADS2 score of 2.1. The patient population was 64 % male, 70 % Caucasian and 16 % Asian. 
For patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 
2-3) was 64.4 % (median TTR 67 %). 
The RE-LY study demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, at a dose of 110 mg twice daily, is 
non-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in subjects with atrial 
fibrillation, with a reduced risk of ICH, total bleeding and major bleeding. The dose of 150 mg twice 
daily reduces significantly the risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, ICH and total 
bleeding compared to warfarin. Major bleeding rates with this dose were comparable to warfarin. 
Myocardial infarction rates were slightly increased with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily and 
150 mg twice daily compared to warfarin (hazard ratio 1.29; p= 0.0929 and hazard ratio 1.27; 
p= 0.1240, respectively). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of dabigatran 
etexilate compared to warfarin diminish.

For the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding there was an interaction of treatment effect and age. 
The relative risk of bleeding with dabigatran compared to warfarin increased with age. Relative risk 
was highest in patients ≥ 75 years. The concomitant use of antiplatelets ASA or clopidogrel 
approximately doubles MBE rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. There was no 
significant interaction of treatment effects with the subgroups of renal function and CHADS2 score.

RELY-ABLE (Long term multi-center extension of dabigatran treatment in patients with atrial 
fibrillation who completed the RE-LY trial) 
The RE-LY extension study (RELY-ABLE) provided additional safety information for a cohort of 
patients which continued the same dose of dabigatran etexilate as assigned in the RE-LY trial. Patients 
were eligible for the RELY-ABLE trial if they had not permanently discontinued study medicinal 
product at the time of their final RE-LY study visit. Enrolled patients continued to receive the same 
double-blind dabigatran etexilate dose randomly allocated in RE-LY, for up to 43 months of follow up 
after RE-LY (total mean follow-up RE-LY + RELY-ABLE, 4.5 years). There were 5 897 patients 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enrolled, representing 49 % of patients originally randomly assigned to receive dabigatran etexilate in 
RE-LY and 86 % of RELY-ABLE–eligible patients. 
During the additional 2.5 years of treatment in RELY-ABLE, with a maximum exposure of over 
6 years (total exposure in RELY + RELY-ABLE), the long-term safety profile of dabigatran etexilate 
was confirmed for both test doses 110 mg twice a day and 150 mgtwice a day. No new safety findings 
were observed. 
The rates of outcome events including, major bleed and other bleeding events were consistent with 
those seen in RE-LY. 
Data from non-interventional studies 
A non-interventional study (GLORIA-AF) prospectively collected (in its second phase) safety and 
effectiveness data in newly diagnosed NVAF patients on dabigatran etexilate in a real-world setting. 
The study included 4 859 patients on dabigatran etexilate (55 % treated with 150 mg twice a day, 43 % 
treated with 110 mg twice a day, 2 % treated with 75 mg twice a day). Patients were followed-up for 
2 years. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were 1.9 and 1.2, respectively. Mean on-therapy 
follow-up time was 18.3 months. Major bleeding occurred in 0.97 per 100 patient-years. Life-
threatening bleeding was reported in 0.46 per 100 patient-years, intracranial haemorrhage in 0.17 per 
100 patient-years and gastrointestinal bleeding in 0.60 per 100 patient-years. Stroke occurred in 
0.65 per 100 patient-years. 
In addition, in a non-interventional study [Graham DJ et al., Circulation. 2015 ;131 :157-164] in more 
than 134 000 elderly patients with NVAF in the United States (contributing more than 37 500 patient-
years of on-therapy follow-up time) dabigatran etexilate (84 % patients treated with 150 mg twice a 
day, 16 % patients treated with 75 mg twice a day) was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic 
stroke (hazard ratio 0.80, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.67 – 0.96), intracranial haemorrhage (hazard 
ratio 0.34, CI 0.26 – 0.46), and mortality (hazard ratio 0.86, CI 0.77 – 0.96) and increased risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding (hazard ratio 1.28, CI 1.14 – 1.44) compared to warfarin. No difference was 
found for major bleeding (hazard ratio 0.97, CI 0.88 – 1.07). 
These observations in real-world settings are consistent with the established safety and efficacy profile 
for dabigatran etexilate in the RE-LY study in this indication.  
Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting 
A prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study (Phase IIIb) to evaluate dual-
therapy with dabigatran etexilate (110 mg or 150 mg twice a day) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor 
(P2Y12 antagonist) vs. triple-therapy with warfarin (adjusted to a INR 2.0-3.0) plus clopidogrel or 
ticagrelor and ASA was conducted in 2 725 patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who 
underwent a PCI with stenting (RE-DUAL PCI). Patients were randomised to dabigatran etexilate 
110 mg twice a day dual-therapy, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice a day dual-therapy or warfarin 
triple-therapy. Elderly patients outside of the United States (≥ 80 years of age for all countries, 
≥ 70 years of age for Japan) were randomly assigned to the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg dual-therapy 
group or the warfarin triple-therapy group. The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint of major 
bleeds based on ISTH definition or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event. 
The incidence of the primary endpoint was 15.4 % (151 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg 
dual-therapy group as compared with 26.9 % (264 patients) in the warfarin triple-therapy group 
(HR 0.52; 95 % CI 0.42, 0.63; P< 0.0001 for non-inferiority and P< 0.0001 for superiority) and 20.2 % 
(154 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 25.7 % 
(196 patients) in the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.72; 95 % CI 0.58, 0.88; 
P< 0.0001 for non-inferiority and P=0.002 for superiority). As part of the descriptive analysis, TIMI 
(Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding events was lower in both dabigatran etexilate 
dual-therapy groups than in the warfarin triple-therapy group: 14 events (1.4 %) in the dabigatran 
etexilate 110 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 37 events (3.8 %) in the warfarin triple-therapy 
group (HR 0.37; 95 % CI 0.20, 0.68; P= 0.002) and 16 events (2.1 %) in the dabigatran etexilate 
150 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 30 events (3.9 %) in the corresponding warfarin triple-
therapy group (HR 0.51; 95 % CI 0.28, 0.93; P=0.03). Both dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy groups 
had lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group: 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
3 events (0.3 %) in the 110 mg dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 10 events 
(1.0 %) in the warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.30; 95 % CI 0.08, 1.07; P=0.06) and 1 event 
(0.1 %) in the 150 mg dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 8 events (1.0 %) in 
the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.12; 95 % CI 0.02, 0.98; P=0.047). The 
incidence of the composite efficacy endpoint of death, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or systemic embolism) or unplanned revascularization in the two dabigatran etexilate dual-
therapy groups combined was non-inferior to the warfarin triple-therapy group (13.7 % vs. 13.4 % 
respectively; HR 1.04; 95 % CI: 0.84, 1.29; P=0.0047 for non-inferiority).There were no statistical 
differences in the individual components of the efficacy endpoints between either dabigatran etexilate 
dual-therapy groups and warfarin triple-therapy. 
This study demonstrated that dual-therapy with dabigatran etexilate and a P2Y12 antagonist 
significantly reduced the risk of bleeding vs. warfarin triple-therapy with non-inferiority for composite 
of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stenting. 
Treatment of DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment) 
The efficacy and safety was investigated in two multi-center, randomised, double blind, parallel-group, 
replicate studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II. These studies compared dabigatran etexilate 
(150 mg twice a day) with warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) in patients with acute DVT and/or PE. The 
primary objective of these studies was to determine if dabigatran etexilate was non-inferior to warfarin 
in reducing the occurrence of the primary endpoint which was the composite of recurrent symptomatic 
DVT and/or PE and related deaths within the 6 month treatment period. 
In the pooled RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies, a total of 5 153 patients were randomised 
and 5 107 were treated. 
The duration of treatment with fixed dose of dabigatran was 174.0 days without coagulation 
monitoring. For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0 to 3.0) 
was 60.6 %. 
The trials, demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior 
to the treatment with warfarin (non-inferiority margin for RE-COVER, and RE-COVER II: 3.6 for risk 
difference and 2.75 for hazard ratio).

Prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE prevention) 
Two randomised, parallel group, double-blind studies were performed in patients previously treated 
with anticoagulation therapy. RE-MEDY, warfarin controlled study, enrolled patients already treated 
for 3 to 12 months with the need for further anticoagulant treatment and RE-SONATE, the placebo 
controlled study, enrolled patients already treated for 6 to 18 months with Vitamin K inhibitors. 
The objective of the RE-MEDY study was to compare the safety and efficacy of oral dabigatran 
etexilate (150 mg twice a day) to warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) for the long-term treatment and 
prevention of recurrent, symptomatic DVT and/or PE. A total of 2 866 patients were randomised and 
2 856 patients were treated. Duration of dabigatran etexilate treatment ranged from 6 to 36 months 
(median 534.0 days). For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 
2.0-3.0) was 64.9 %. 
RE-MEDY demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior 
to warfarin (non-inferiority margin: 2.85 for hazard ratio and 2.8 for risk difference).

The objective of the RE-SONATE study was to evaluate superiority of dabigatran etexilate versus 
placebo for the prevention of recurrent symptomatic DVT and/or PE in patients who had already 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
completed 6 to 18 months of treatment with VKA. The intended therapy was 6 months dabigatran 
etexilate 150 mg twice daily without need for monitoring. 
RE-SONATE demonstrated dabigatran etexilate was superior to placebo for the prevention of 
recurrent symptomatic DVT/PE events including unexplained deaths, with a risk reduction from 5.6 % 
to 0.4 % (relative risk reduction 92 % based on hazard ratio) during the treatment period (p< 0.0001). 
All secondary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints showed 
superiority of dabigatran etexilate over placebo. 
The study included observational follow-up for 12 months after the conclusion of treatment. After 
discontinuation of study medicinal product the effect was maintained until the end of the follow-up, 
indicating that the initial treatment effect of dabigatran etexilate was sustained. No rebound effect was 
observed. At the end of the follow-up VTE events in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate was 
6.9 % vs. 10.7 % among the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.61 (95 % CI 0.42, 0.88), p= 0.0082).

Clinical trials for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves 
A phase II study examined dabigatran etexilate and warfarin in a total of 252 patients with recent 
mechanical valve replacement surgery (i.e. within the current hospital stay) and in patients who 
received a mechanical heart valve replacement more than three months ago. More thromboembolic 
events (mainly strokes and symptomatic/asymptomatic prosthetic valve thrombosis) and more 
bleeding events were observed with dabigatran etexilate than with warfarin. In the early post-operative 
patients, major bleeding manifested predominantly as haemorrhagic pericardial effusions, specifically 
in patients who started dabigatran etexilate early (i.e. on day 3) after heart valve replacement surgery 
(see section 4.3).

Paediatric population 
Clinical trials in VTE prophylaxis following major joint replacement surgery 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing dabigatran etexilate in all subsets of the paediatric population 
for the indication of primary prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone elective total hip 
replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery and the indication of prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism in patients with NVAF (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
The DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate 
compared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less 
than 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, 
non-inferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an 
age-appropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses 
adjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or 
vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a 
composite endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and 
freedom from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and 
intracranial abscess. 
In total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran 
etexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were 
12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than 
2 years. 
Of the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients 
(42.2 %) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus 
resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The 
corresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent 
results were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the 
treatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the 
3 different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the 
dabigatran etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1 %) and 7/13 (53.8 %) for patients 
from birth to < 2 years, 21/43 (48.8 %) and 12/21 (57.1 %) for patients aged 2 to < 12 years, and 
47/112 (42.0 %) and 19/56 (33.9 %) for patients aged 12 to < 18 years. 
Adjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 
2 patients (2.2 %) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first 
major bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6 %) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients 
(24.4 %) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The 
combined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major 
(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4 %) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group 
and 3 (3.3 %) patients in the SOC group. 
An open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1 160.108) was 
conducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the 
presence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least 
3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study.  
Eligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, 
coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a 
maximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic 
events) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication 
committee. 
Overall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less than 
18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients in age 
stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4 %) 
had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start.  
Adjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients 
(22.5 %) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients 
(1.4 %), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For 
3 patients (1.4 %), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months.  
No on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4 %) developed 
post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, 
which is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by esterase-
catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. The 
absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of dabigatran etexilate was 
approximately 6.5 %. 
After oral administration of dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of 
dabigatran in plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained 
within 0.5 and 2.0 hours post administration. 
Absorption 
A study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, 
demonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth 
plasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to 
contributing factors such as anaesthesia, gastrointestinal paresis, and surgical effects independent of 
the oral medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed 
absorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran 
is rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration. 
Food does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma 
concentrations by 2 hours. 
Cmax and AUC were dose proportional. 
The oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % after a single dose and 37 % at steady state 
compared to the reference capsule formulation when the pellets are taken without the 
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, the integrity of the HPMC capsules 
should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally increased bioavailability of 
dabigatran etexilate (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was 
observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60–70 L exceeded the volume of total body 
water indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived 
radioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the 
administered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose 
by 168 hours post dose. 
Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four 
positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical 
methods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of 
approximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate. 
Elimination 
Plasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of 
11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was 
observed. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as 
shown in table 30. 
Special populations 
Renal insufficiency 
In phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran 
etexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL 
between 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency. 
In a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the 
exposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately 
2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 
4.3 and 4.4).

function.

27.2 (15.3 %; 21.6-35.0) 
Additionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label 
randomised pharmacokinetic study in NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (defined as 
creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 75 mg twice daily. This 
regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9 %), measured 
immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak concentration of 
202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6 %) measured two hours after the administration of the last dose. 
Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 adult patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow 
rate, four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted 
in a removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance 
cleared by dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD 
relationship was not affected by the procedure. 
The median CrCL in RE-LY was 68.4 mL/min. Almost half (45.8 %) of the RE-LY patients had a 
CrCL > 50-< 80 mL/min. Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min) 
had on average 2.29-fold and 1.81-fold higher pre-and post-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations, 
respectively, when compared with patients without renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 80 mL/min). 
The median CrCL in the RE-COVER study was 100.4 mL/min. 21.7 % of patients had mild renal 
impairment (CrCL > 50-< 80 mL/min) and 4.5 % of patients had a moderate renal impairment (CrCL 
between 30 and 50 mL/min). Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment had at steady state an 
average 1.8-fold and 3.6-fold higher pre-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations compared with 
patients with CrCL > 80 mL/min, respectively. Similar values for CrCL were found in RE-COVER II. 
The median CrCL in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies were 99.0 mL/min and 99.7 mL/min, 
respectively. 22.9 % and 22.5 % of the patients had a CrCL > 50-< 80 mL/min, and 4.1 % and 4.8 % 
had a CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies. 
Elderly patients 
Specific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the 
AUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects. 
The effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % 
higher trough concentration for subjects ≥ 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects 
< 65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
No change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency 
(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Body weight 
The dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in adult patients with a body weight 
> 100 kg compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ≥ 50 kg and 
< 100 kg category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in 
adult patients < 50 kg are available. 
Gender 
Active substance exposure in the primary VTE prevention studies was about 40 % to 50 % higher in 
female patients and no dose adjustment is recommended. In atrial fibrillation patients females had on 
average 30 % higher trough and post-dose concentrations. No dose adjustment is required (see 
section 4.2) 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Paediatric population 
Oral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted 
in exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT/PE. Based on the pooled analysis of 
pharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1 160.108, the observed geometric mean trough 
exposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to < 2-year-old, 2 to < 12-year-old and 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 to < 18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
In vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of 
cytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not 
show any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin 
(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of dabigatran. 
An effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in 
pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were 
toxic to the mothers (5-to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body 
weight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the 
pre-and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the 
dams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
In a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding 
events at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile 
rats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in 
association with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile 
toxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to 
juvenile animals. 
In lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of 
dabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg. 
Dabigatran, the active moiety of dabigatran etexilate mesilate, is persistent in the environment.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
(NVAF), with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); age 
≥ 75 years; heart failure (NYHA Class ≥ II); diabetes mellitus; hypertension. 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults 
Treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 18 years of age. 
For age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Dabigatran etexilate Accord hard capsules can be used in adults and paediatric patients aged 8 years or 
older who are able to swallow the capsules whole. Other pharmaceutical forms may be more 
appropriate for administration to this population such as coated granules which can be used in children 
aged less than 12 years as soon as the child is able to swallow soft food. Other pharmaceutical forms 
such as powder and solvent for oral solution should only be used in children aged less than 1 year. 
When changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The dose stated 
in the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed based on the weight and age of the 
child.

daily dose of dabigatran etexilate of 300 mg or 
220 mg should be selected based on an 
individual assessment of the thromboembolic 
risk and the risk of bleeding 
For DVT/PE the recommendation for the use of 220 mg dabigatran etexilate taken as one 110 mg 
capsule twice daily is based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses and has not been 
studied in this clinical setting. See further down and sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2. 
In case of intolerability to dabigatran etexilate, patients should be instructed to immediately consult 
their treating physician in order to be switched to alternate acceptable treatment options for prevention 
of stroke and systemic embolism associated with atrial fibrillation or for DVT/PE. 
Assessment of renal function prior to and during dabigatran etexilate treatment 
In all patients and especially in the elderly (> 75 years), as renal impairment may be frequent in this 
age group: 
• 
Renal function should be assessed by calculating the creatinine clearance (CrCL) prior to 
initiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate to exclude patients with severe renal impairment 
(i.e. CrCL < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal function should also be assessed when a decline in renal function is suspected during 
treatment (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal 
products). 
• 
Additional requirements in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and in patients aged over 
75 years: 
• 
Renal function should be assessed during treatment with dabigatran etexilate at least once a year 
or more frequently as needed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected that the renal 
function could decline or deteriorate (e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of 
concomitant use of certain medicinal products). 
The method to be used to estimate renal function (CrCL in mL/min) is the Cockcroft-Gault method 
73

Duration of use 
SPAF 
DVT/PE 
Missed dose 
Therapy should be continued long term. 
The duration of therapy should be individualised after careful assessment of 
the treatment benefit against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). 
Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be based on transient risk 
factors (e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation) and longer durations 
should be based on permanent risk factors or idiopathic DVT or PE. 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. 
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose on, the missed dose should be omitted. 
No double dose should be taken to make up for missed individual doses. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients should be 
instructed to contact the treating physician if they develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as dyspepsia 
(see section 4.8). 
Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA): 
The starting time of the VKA should be adjusted based on CrCL as follows: 
• 
• 
CrCL ≥ 50 mL/min, VKA should be started 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate 
CrCL ≥ 30-< 50 mL/min, VKA should be started 2 days before discontinuing dabigatran 
etexilate 
Because dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better 
reflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, 
INR values should be interpreted with caution. 
VKA to dabigatran etexilate: 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is < 2.0.

Cardioversion (SPAF) 
Patients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. 
Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (SPAF) 
Catheter ablation can be conducted in patients on 150 mg twice daily dabigatran etexilate treatment. 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment does not need to be interrupted (see section 5.1). 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting (SPAF) 
Patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who undergo a PCI with stenting can be treated with 
dabigatran etexilate in combination with antiplatelets after haemostasis is achieved (see section 5.1). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
For dose modifications in this population see table 1 above. 
Patients at risk of bleeding 
Patients with an increased bleeding risk (see sections 4.4, 4.5, .1 and 5.2) should be closely monitored 
clinically (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia). Dose adjustment should be decided at the 
discretion of the physician, following assessment of the potential benefit and risk to an individual 
patient (see table 2 above). A coagulation test (see section 4.4) may help to identify patients with an 
increased bleeding risk caused by excessive dabigatran exposure. When excessive dabigatran exposure 
is identified in patients at high risk of bleeding, a reduced dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule 
twice daily is recommended. When clinically relevant bleeding occurs, treatment should be 
interrupted. 
For subjects with gastritis, esophagitis, or gastroesophageal reflux, a dose reduction may be considered 
due to the elevated risk of major gastro-intestinal bleeding (see table 1 above and section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCL 50 ≤ 80 mL/min). For 
patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) the recommended dose of dabigatran 
etexilate is also 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice daily. However, for patients with high risk 
of bleeding, a dose reduction of dabigatran etexilate to 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice 
daily should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Close clinical surveillance is recommended in 
patients with renal impairment. 
Concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with mild to moderate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, i.e. 
amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil 
No dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of amiodarone or quinidine (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.2). 
Dose reductions are recommended for patients who receive concomitantly verapamil (see table 1 
above and sections 4.4 and 4.5). In this situation dabigatran etexilate and verapamil should be taken at 
the same time. 
Weight 
No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2), but close clinical surveillance is recommended in 
patients with a body weight < 50 kg (see section 4.4). 
Gender

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric population for the indication of 
prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF. 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
For the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients, treatment should be initiated following treatment with 
a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For prevention of recurrent VTE, treatment should be 
initiated following previous treatment. 
Dabigatran etexilate capsules should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in 
the evening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 
12 hours as possible. 
The recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules is based on the patient’s weight and age as 
shown in table 3. The dose should be adjusted according to weight and age as treatment progresses. 
For weight and age combinations not listed in the dosing table no dosing recommendation can be 
provided.

Assessment of renal function prior to and during treatment 
Prior to the initiation of treatment, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be estimated 
using the Schwartz formula (method used for creatinine assessment to be checked with local lab). 
Treatment with dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients with eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with an eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2 should be treated with the dose according to table 3. 
While on treatment, renal function should be assessed in certain clinical situations when it is suspected 
that the renal function could decline or deteriorate (such as hypovolemia, dehydration, and with certain 
co-medications, etc). 
Duration of use 
The duration of therapy should be individualised based on the benefit risk assessment. 
Missed dose 
A forgotten dabigatran etexilate dose may still be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. 
From 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose onwards, the missed dose should be omitted. 
A double dose to make up for missed individual doses must never be taken. 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should not be discontinued without medical advice. Patients or their 
caregivers should be instructed to contact the treating physician if the patient develops gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as dyspepsia (see section 4.8). 
Switching 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to parenteral anticoagulant: 
It is recommended to wait 12 hours after the last dose before switching from dabigatran etexilate to a 
parenteral anticoagulant (see section 4.5). 
Parenteral anticoagulants to dabigatran etexilate: 
The parenteral anticoagulant should be discontinued and dabigatran etexilate should be started 
0-2 hours prior to the time that the next dose of the alternate therapy would be due, or at the time of 
discontinuation in case of continuous treatment (e.g. intravenous Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)) (see 
section 4.5). 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA): 
Patients should start VKA 3 days before discontinuing dabigatran etexilate. 
Because dabigatran etexilate can impact the international normalised ratio (INR), the INR will better 
reflect VKA’s effect only after dabigatran etexilate has been stopped for at least 2 days. Until then, 
INR values should be interpreted with caution. 
VKA to dabigatran etexilate: 
The VKA should be stopped. Dabigatran etexilate can be given as soon as the INR is < 2.0. 
Method of administration 
This medicinal product is for oral use. 
The capsules can be taken with or without food. The capsules should be swallowed as a whole with a 
glass of water, to facilitate delivery to the stomach. 
Patients should be instructed not to open the capsule as this may increase the risk of bleeding (see 
sections 5.2 and 6.6).

Active clinically significant bleeding 
Lesion or condition, if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include 
current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of 
bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent 
intracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous 
malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities 
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. unfractionated heparin (UFH), low 
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin etc), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux etc), 
oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban etc) except under specific circumstances. 
These are switching anticoagulant therapy (see section 4.2), when UFH is given at doses 
necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during 
catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.5) 
Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival 
Concomitant treatment with the following strong P-gp inhibitors: systemic ketoconazole, 
cyclosporine, itraconazole, dronedarone and the fixed-dose combination glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
(see section 4.5) 
Prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment (see section 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhagic risk 
Dabigatran etexilate should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of bleeding or 
with concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis by inhibition of platelet aggregation.  
Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy. An unexplained fall in haemoglobin and/or haematocrit 
or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
For adult patients in situations of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, when rapid reversal of the 
anticoagulation effect of dabigatran is required, the specific reversal agent idarucizumab is available.  
The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. 
Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran. For adult patients, fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma, 
coagulation factor concentration (activated or non-activated), recombinant factor VIIa or platelet 
concentrates are other possible options (see also section 4.9). 
In clinical trials, dabigatran etexilate was associated with higher rates of major gastrointestinal (GI) 
bleeding. An increased risk was seen in the elderly (≥ 75 years) for the 150 mg twice daily dose 
regimen. Further risk factors (see also table 4) comprise co-medication with platelet aggregation 
inhibitors such as clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
(NSAID), as well as the presence of esophagitis, gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux. 
Risk factors 
Table 4 summarises factors which may increase the haemorrhagic risk.

• 
• 
• 
Limited data is available in adult patients < 50 kg (see section 5.2). 
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in paediatric 
patients but may increase the risk of bleeding (see section 4.5). 
Precautions and management of the haemorrhagic risk 
For the management of bleeding complications, see also section 4.9. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
The presence of lesions, conditions, procedures and/or pharmacological treatment (such as NSAIDs, 
antiplatelets, SSRIs and SNRIs, see section 4.5), which significantly increase the risk of major 
bleeding requires a careful benefit-risk assessment. Dabigatran etexilate should only be given if the 
benefit outweighs bleeding risks. 
Limited clinical data are available for paediatric patients with risk factors, including patients with 
active meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess (see section 5.1). In these patients, dabigatran 
etexilate should only be given if the expected benefit outweighs bleeding risks. 
Close clinical surveillance 
Close observation for signs of bleeding or anaemia is recommended throughout the treatment period, 
especially if risk factors are combined (see table 4 above). Particular caution should be exercised when 
dabigatran etexilate is co-administered with verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine or clarithromycin (P-gp 
inhibitors) and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a reduced renal 
function (see section 4.5). 
Close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended in patients concomitantly treated with 
NSAIDs (see section 4.5). 
Discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate 
Patients who develop acute renal failure must discontinue dabigatran etexilate (see also section 4.3). 
When severe bleedings occur, treatment must be discontinued, the source of bleeding investigated and 
use of the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) may be considered in adult patients. The efficacy and 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients. Haemodialysis can remove 
dabigatran. 
Use of proton-pump inhibitors 
The administration of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered to prevent GI bleeding. In case 
of paediatric patients local labeling recommendations for proton pump inhibitors have to be followed. 
Laboratory coagulation parameters 
Although this medicinal product does not in general require routine anticoagulant monitoring, the 
measurement of dabigatran related anticoagulation may be helpful to detect excessive high exposure to 
dabigatran in the presence of additional risk factors. 
Diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) may provide useful information, but results should be interpreted with caution due to inter-test 
variability (see section 5.1).  
The international normalised ratio (INR) test is unreliable in patients on dabigatran etexilate and false 
positive INR elevations have been reported. Therefore INR tests should not be performed. 
Table 5 shows coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding. Respective thresholds for paediatric patients are not known (see section 5.1) 
Table 5: Coagulation test thresholds at trough for adult patients that may be associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding.

Use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
The use of fibrinolytic medicinal products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be 
considered if the patient presents with a dTT, ECT or aPTT not exceeding the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) according to the local reference range. 
Surgery and interventions 
Patients on dabigatran etexilate who undergo surgery or invasive procedures are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Therefore, surgical interventions may require the temporary discontinuation of dabigatran 
etexilate. 
Patients can stay on dabigatran etexilate while being cardioverted. Dabigatran etexilate treatment 
(150 mg twice daily) does not need to be interrupted in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial 
fibrillation (see section 4.2). 
Caution should be exercised when treatment is temporarily discontinued for interventions and 
anticoagulant monitoring is warranted. Clearance of dabigatran in patients with renal insufficiency 
may take longer (see section 5.2). This should be considered in advance of any procedures. In such 
cases a coagulation test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) may help to determine whether haemostasis is still 
impaired. 
Emergency surgery or urgent procedures 
Dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. When rapid reversal of the anticoagulation 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effect is required the specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) to dabigatran is available for adult 
patients. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients.  
Haemodialysis can remove dabigatran. 
Reversing dabigatran therapy exposes patients to the thrombotic risk of their underlying disease. 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment can be re-initiated 24 hours after administration of idarucizumab, if the 
patient is clinically stable and adequate haemostasis has been achieved. 
Subacute surgery/interventions 
Dabigatran etexilate should be temporarily discontinued. A surgery/intervention should be delayed if 
possible until at least 12 hours after the last dose. If surgery cannot be delayed the risk of bleeding may 
be increased. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. 
Elective surgery 
If possible, dabigatran etexilate should be discontinued at least 24 hours before invasive or surgical 
procedures. In patients at higher risk of bleeding or in major surgery where complete haemostasis may 
be required consider stopping dabigatran etexilate 2-4 days before surgery. 
Table 6 summarises discontinuation rules before invasive or surgical procedures for adult patients.

Spinal anaesthesia/epidural anaesthesia/lumbar puncture 
Procedures such as spinal anaesthesia may require complete haemostatic function. 
The risk of spinal or epidural haematoma may be increased in cases of traumatic or repeated puncture 
and by the prolonged use of epidural catheters. After removal of a catheter, an interval of at least 
2 hours should elapse before the administration of the first dose of dabigatran etexilate. These patients 
require frequent observation for neurological signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural haematoma. 
Postoperative phase 
Dabigatran etexilate treatment should be resumed/started after the invasive procedure or surgical 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intervention as soon as possible provided the clinical situation allows and adequate haemostasis has 
been established. 
Patients at risk for bleeding or patients at risk of overexposure, notably patients with reduced renal 
function (see also table 4), should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Patients at high surgical mortality risk and with intrinsic risk factors for thromboembolic events 
There are limited efficacy and safety data for dabigatran etexilate available in these patients and 
therefore they should be treated with caution. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes > 2 ULN were excluded in the main trials. No treatment 
experience is available for this subpopulation of patients, and therefore the use of dabigatran etexilate 
is not recommended in this population. Hepatic impairment or liver disease expected to have any 
impact on survival is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Interaction with P-gp inducers 
Concomitant administration of P-gp inducers is expected to result in decreased dabigatran plasma 
concentrations, and should be avoided (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran etexilate are not recommended for 
patients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular 
for patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–beta 
2glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of 
recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. 
Myocardial Infarction (MI) 
In the phase III study RE-LY (SPAF, see section 5.1) the overall rate of MI was 0.82, 0.81, and 
0.64 %/year for dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily and 
warfarin, respectively, an increase in relative risk for dabigatran of 29 % and 27 % compared to 
warfarin. Irrespective of therapy, the highest absolute risk of MI was seen in the following subgroups, 
with similar relative risk: patients with previous MI, patients ≥ 65 years with either diabetes or 
coronary artery disease, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, and patients with 
moderate renal dysfunction. Furthermore a higher risk of MI was seen in patients concomitantly taking 
ASA plus clopidogrel or clopidogrel alone. 
In the three active controlled DVT/PE phase III studies, a higher rate of MI was reported in patients 
who received dabigatran etexilate than in those who received warfarin: 0.4 % vs. 0.2 % in the short 
term RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies; and 0.8 % vs. 0.1 % in the long-term RE-MEDY trial. 
The increase was statistically significant in this study (p=0.022). 
In the RE-SONATE study, which compared dabigatran etexilate to placebo, the rate of MI was 0.1 % 
for patients who received dabigatran etexilate and 0.2 % for patients who received placebo. 
Active cancer patients (DVT/PE, paediatric VTE) 
The efficacy and safety have not been established for DVT/PE patients with active cancer. There is 
limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
For some very specific paediatric patients, e.g. patients with small bowel disease where absorption 
may be affected, use of an anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration should be considered. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’ 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Transporter interactions 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. Concomitant administration of P-gp 
inhibitors (see table 8) is expected to result in increased dabigatran plasma concentrations. 
If not otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or 
anaemia) is required when dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. Dose reductions 
may be required in combination with some P-gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Table 8: Transporter interactions 
P-gp inhibitors 
Concomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3) 
Ketoconazole 
Dronedarone 
Itraconazole, 
cyclosporine 
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
Ketoconazole increased total dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values by 2.38-fold 
and 2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 
2.53-fold and 2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg 
ketoconazole once daily. 
When dabigatran etexilate and dronedarone were given at the same time total 
dabigatran AUC0-∞ and Cmax values increased by about 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold, 
respectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg dronedarone twice a day, and 
about 2.1-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg. 
Based on in vitro results a similar effect as with ketoconazole may be 
expected. 
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate with the fixed-dose combination 
of the P-gp inhibitors glecaprevir/pibrentasvir has been shown to increase 
exposure of dabigatran and may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Tacrolimus 
Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect 
on P gp as that seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate 
has not been clinically studied together with tacrolimus. However, limited 
clinical data with another P-gp substrate (everolimus) suggest that the 
inhibition of P-gp with tacrolimus is weaker than that observed with strong P-
gp inhibitors. 
Cautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was co-administered with oral verapamil, 
the Cmax and AUC of dabigatran were increased but the magnitude of this 
change differs depending on timing of administration and formulation of 
verapamil (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The greatest elevation of dabigatran exposure was observed with the first dose 
of an immediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour prior 
to the dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 2.8-fold and AUC 
by about 2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration 
of an extended release formulation (increase of Cmax by about 1.9-fold and 
AUC by about 1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of verapamil 
(increase of Cmax by about 1.6-fold and AUC by about 1.5-fold). 
There was no meaningful interaction observed when verapamil was given 
2 hours after dabigatran etexilate (increase of Cmax by about 1.1-fold and AUC 
by about 1.2-fold). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 
2 hours. 
When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with a single oral dose of 
600 mg amiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its 
active metabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The dabigatran AUC and 
Cmax were increased by about 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. In view of 
the long half-life of amiodarone the potential for an interaction may exist for 
weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Quinidine was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 
1 000 mg. Dabigatran etexilate was given twice daily over 3 consecutive days, 
on the 3rd day either with or without quinidine. Dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 
were increased on average by 1.53-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively with 
concomitant quinidine (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
When clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with 
dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19-fold 
and Cmax by about 1.15-fold was observed. 
When a single dose of 75 mg dabigatran etexilate was coadministered 
simultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor, the dabigatran AUC 
and Cmax were increased by 1.73-fold and 1.95-fold, respectively. After 
multiple doses of ticagrelor 90 mg twice a day the increase of dabigatran 
exposure is 1.56-fold and 1.46-fold for Cmax and AUC, respectively. 
Concomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor and 
110 mg dabigatran etexilate (in steady state) increased the dabigatran AUCτ,ss 
and Cmax,ss by 1.49-fold and 1.65-fold, respectively, compared with dabigatran 
etexilate given alone. When a loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor was given 
2 hours after 110 mg dabigatran etexilate (in steady state), the increase of 
dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss was reduced to 1.27-fold and 1.23-fold, 
respectively, compared with dabigatran etexilate given alone. This staggered 
intake is the recommended administration for start of ticagrelor with a loading 
dose. 
Concomitant administration of 90 mg ticagrelor twice a day (maintenance 
dose) with 110 mg dabigatran etexilate increased the adjusted dabigatran 
AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss 1.26-fold and 1.29-fold, respectively, compared with 
dabigatran etexilate given alone 
Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically 
studied. Caution should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is co-
administered with posaconazole.

Concomitant administration is expected to result in decreased dabigatran 
concentrations. 
Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 
7 days decreased total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 % and 
67 %, respectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in dabigatran 
exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin 
treatment. No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 
7 days. 
Protease inhibitors such as ritonavir 
Concomitant use not recommended 
e.g. ritonavir and its 
combinations with other 
protease inhibitors 
These affect P-gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been 
studied and are therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with 
dabigatran etexilate. 
P-gp substrate 
Digoxin 
In a study performed with 24 healthy subjects, when dabigatran etexilate was 
co-administered with digoxin, no changes on digoxin and no clinically 
relevant changes on dabigatran exposure have been observed. 
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products 
There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of 
bleeding when used concomitantly with dabigatran etexilate: anticoagulants such as unfractionated 
heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, 
desirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban or other oral 
anticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GPIIb/IIIa 
receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dextran, and sulfinpyrazone (see section 4.4). 
From the data collected in the phase III study RE-LY (see section 5.1) it was observed that the 
concomitant use of other oral or parenteral anticoagulants increases major bleeding rates with both 
dabigatran etexilate and warfarin by approximately 2.5-fold, mainly related to situations when 
switching from one anticoagulant to another (see section 4.3). Furthermore, concomitant use of 
antiplatelets, ASA or clopidogrel approximately doubled major bleeding rates with both dabigatran 
etexilate and warfarin (see section 4.4). 
UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or 
during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3). 
Table 9: Interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products 
NSAIDs 
Clopidogrel 
ASA 
NSAIDs given for short-term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with 
increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with dabigatran etexilate. With 
chronic use in the RE-LY study, NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by 
approximately 50 % on both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. 
In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of dabigatran 
etexilate and clopidogrel resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding 
times compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,ss and the coagulation measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of 
platelet aggregation as measure of clopidogrel effect remained essentially 
unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective mono-treatments. 
With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and 
Cmax,s were increased by about 30-40 % (see section 4.4). 
Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
LMWH 
increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 24 % with 81 mg and 
325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4). 
The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dabigatran etexilate has 
not been specifically investigated. After switching from 3-day treatment of once 
daily 40 mg enoxaparin s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the 
exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after administration of 
dabigatran etexilate (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti-FXa/FIIa activity 
was observed after dabigatran etexilate administration with enoxaparin pre-
treatment compared to that after treatment with dabigatran etexilate alone. This is 
considered to be due to the carry-over effect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded 
as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-coagulation tests were not 
changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin. 
Other interactions

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs) 
SSRIs, SNRIs 
SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in RE-LY in all treatment groups, 
Substances influencing gastric pH 
Pantoprazole 
Ranitidine 
When dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with pantoprazole, a decrease in 
the dabigatran AUC of approximately 30 % was observed. Pantoprazole and other 
proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) were co-administered with dabigatran etexilate in 
clinical trials, and concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy 
of dabigatran etexilate. 
Ranitidine administration together with dabigatran etexilate had no clinically 
relevant effect on the extent of absorption of dabigatran. 
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile 
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Pregnancy 
There is limited amount of data from the use of dabigatran etexilate in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Dabigatran etexilate should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

Breast-feeding 
There are no clinical data of the effect of dabigatran on infants during breast-feeding. Breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with dabigatran etexilate. 
Fertility 
No human data available. 
In animal studies an effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations 
and an increase in pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (representing a 5-fold higher plasma exposure 
level compared to patients). No other effects on female fertility were observed. There was no influence 
on male fertility. At doses that were toxic to the mothers (representing a 5-to 10-fold higher plasma 
exposure level to patients), a decrease in foetal body weight and embryofoetal viability along with an 
increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the pre-and post-natal study, an 
increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the dams (a dose corresponding to 
a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Dabigatran etexilate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Dabigatran etexilate has been evaluated in clinical trials overall in approximately 64 000 patients; 
thereof approximately 35 000 patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate. 
In total, 22 % of patients with atrial fibrillation treated for the prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism (long-term treatment for up to 3 years), 14 % of patients treated for DVT/PE and 15 % of 
patients treated for DVT/PE prevention experienced adverse reactions. 
The most commonly reported events are bleedings occurring in approximately 16.6 % in patients with 
atrial fibrillation treated long-term for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, and in 14.4 % 
of adult patients treated for DVT/PE. Furthermore, bleeding occurred in 19.4 % of patients in the 
DVT/PE prevention trial RE-MEDY (adult patients) and in 10.5 % of patients in the DVT/PE 
prevention trial RE-SONATE (adult patients). 
Since the patient populations treated in the three indications are not comparable and bleeding events 
are distributed over several System Organ Classes (SOC), a summary description of major and any 
bleeding are broken down by indication and provided in tables 12-15 below. 
Although low in frequency in clinical trials, major or severe bleeding may occur and, regardless of 
location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 11 shows the adverse reactions identified studies and post-marketing data in the indications

DVT/PE treatment and DVT/PE prevention. They are ranked under headings of System Organ Class 
(SOC) and frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not

Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of dabigatran etexilate may be associated with an 
increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ. The signs, symptoms, and severity 
(including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding 
and/or anaemia. In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. gastrointestinal, genitourinary) were 
seen more frequently during long term dabigatran etexilate treatment compared with VKA treatment. 
Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit is of 
value to detect occult bleeding. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. 
those patients with moderate renal impairment and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis 
or strong P-gp inhibitors (see section 4.4 Haemorrhagic risk). Haemorrhagic complications may 
present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and 
unexplained shock. 
Known bleeding complications such as compartment syndrome and acute renal failure due to 
hypoperfusion and anticoagulant-related nephropathy in patients with predisposing risk factors have 
been reported for dabigatran etexilate. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in 
evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient. For adult patients a specific reversal agent for 
dabigatran, idarucizumab, is available in case of uncontrollable bleeding (see Section 4.9). 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with 
one or more risk factors (SPAF) 
The table 12 shows bleeding events broken down to major and any bleeding in the pivotal study testing

Subjects randomised to dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily had a 
significantly lower risk for life-threatening bleeds and intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin [p 
< 0.05]. Both dose strengths of dabigatran etexilate had also a statistically significant lower total bleed 
rate. Subjects randomised to 110 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly lower risk for 
major bleeds compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.81 [p=0.0027]). Subjects randomised to 150 mg

dabigatran etexilate twice daily had a significantly higher risk for major GI bleeds compared with 
warfarin (hazard ratio 1.48 [p =0.0005]. This effect was seen primarily in patients ≥ 75 years. 
The clinical benefit of dabigatran with regard to stroke and systemic embolism prevention and 
decreased risk of ICH compared to warfarin is preserved across individual subgroups, e.g. renal 
impairment, age, concomitant medicinal product use such as anti-platelets or P-gp inhibitors. While 
certain patient subgroups are at an increased risk of major bleeding when treated with an 
anticoagulant, the excess bleeding risk for dabigatran is due to GI bleeding, typically seen within the 
first 3-6 months following initiation of dabigatran etexilate therapy. 
Treatment of DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment) 
Table 13 shows bleeding events in the pooled pivotal studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II testing 
the treatment of DVT and PE. In the pooled studies the primary safety endpoints of major bleeding, 
major or clinically relevant bleeding and any bleeding were significantly lower than warfarin at a 
nominal alpha level of 5 %.

Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported very rarely during post approval use of 
dabigatran etexilate. Because adverse reactions are reported in the postmarketing surveillance setting 
from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably determine their frequency. The 
reporting rate was estimated as 7 events per 1 million patient years for agranulocytosis and as 5 events 
per 1 million patient years for neutropenia. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients was studied in two phase III trials (DIVERSITY and 1 160.108). In total, 
328 paediatric patients had been treated with dabigatran etexilate. The patients received age and 
weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate. 
Overall, the safety profile in children is expected to be the same as in adults. 
In total, 26 % of paediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate for VTE and for prevention of 
recurrent VTE experienced adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 16 shows the adverse reactions identified from the studies in the treatment of VTE and 
prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients. They are ranked under headings of System Organ 
Class (SOC) and frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100

In the two phase III trials in the indication treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in 
paediatric patients, a total of 7 patients (2.1 %) had a major bleeding event, 5 patients (1.5 %) a 
clinically relevant non-major bleeding event and 75 patients (22.9 %) a minor bleeding event. The 
frequency of bleeding events was overall higher in the oldest age group (12 to < 18 years: 28.6 %) than 
in the younger age groups (birth to < 2 years: 23.3 %; 2 to < 12 years: 16.2 %). Major or severe 
bleeding, regardless of location, may lead to disabling, life-threatening or even fatal outcomes. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Dabigatran etexilate doses beyond those recommended, expose the patient to increased risk of 
bleeding. 
In case of an overdose suspicion, coagulation tests can help to determine a bleeding risk (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). A calibrated quantitative dTT test or repetitive dTT measurements allow 
prediction of the time by when certain dabigatran levels will be reached (see section 5.1), also in case 
additional measures e.g. dialysis have been initiated. 
Excessive anticoagulation may require interruption of dabigatran etexilate treatment. Since dabigatran 
is excreted predominantly by the renal route adequate diuresis must be maintained. As protein binding 
is low, dabigatran can be dialysed; there is limited clinical experience to demonstrate the utility of this 
approach in clinical studies (see section 5.2). 
Management of bleeding complications 
In the event of haemorrhagic complications, dabigatran etexilate treatment must be discontinued and 
the source of bleeding investigated. Depending on the clinical situation appropriate supportive 
treatment, such as surgical haemostasis and blood volume replacement, should be undertaken at the 
prescriber’s discretion. 
For adult patients in situations when rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is required 
the specific reversal agent idarucizumab antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of dabigatran is 
available. The efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in paediatric patients (see 
section 4.4). 
Coagulation factor concentrates (activated or non-activated) or recombinant Factor VIIa may be taken 
into account. There is some experimental evidence to support the role of these medicinal products in 
reversing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, but data on their usefulness in clinical settings and 
also on the possible risk of rebound thromboembolism is very limited. Coagulation tests may become 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unreliable following administration of suggested coagulation factor concentrates. Caution should be 
exercised when interpreting these tests. Consideration should also be given to administration of 
platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long acting antiplatelet medicinal 
products have been used. All symptomatic treatment should be given according to the physician's 
judgement. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation of a coagulation expert should be considered in case of 
major bleedings.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agents, direct thrombin inhibitors, ATC code: B01AE07. 
Mechanism of action 
Dabigatran etexilate is a small molecule prodrug which does not exhibit any pharmacological activity. 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dabigatran by 
esterase-catalysed hydrolysis in plasma and in the liver. Dabigatran is a potent, competitive, reversible 
direct thrombin inhibitor and is the main active principle in plasma. 
Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In vivo and ex vivo animal studies have demonstrated antithrombotic efficacy and anticoagulant 
activity of dabigatran after intravenous administration and of dabigatran etexilate after oral 
administration in various animal models of thrombosis. 
There is a clear correlation between plasma dabigatran concentration and degree of anticoagulant 
effect based on phase II studies. Dabigatran prolongs the thrombin time (TT), ECT, and aPTT. 
The calibrated quantitative diluted TT (dTT) test provides an estimation of dabigatran plasma 
concentration that can be compared to the expected dabigatran plasma concentrations. When the 
calibrated dTT assay delivers a dabigatran plasma concentration result at or below the limit of 
quantification, an additional coagulation assay such as TT, ECT or aPTT should be considered. 
The ECT can provide a direct measure of the activity of direct thrombin inhibitors. 
The aPTT test is widely available and provides an approximate indication of the anticoagulation 
intensity achieved with dabigatran. However, the aPTT test has limited sensitivity and is not suitable 
for precise quantification of anticoagulant effect, especially at high plasma concentrations of 
dabigatran. Although high aPTT values should be interpreted with caution, a high aPTT value 
indicates that the patient is anticoagulated. 
In general, it can be assumed that these measures of anti-coagulant activity may reflect dabigatran 
levels and can provide guidance for the assessment of bleeding risk, i.e. exceeding the 90th percentile 
of dabigatran trough levels or a coagulation assay such as aPTT measured at trough (for aPTT 
thresholds see section 4.4, table 5) is considered to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors 
(SPAF)  
Steady state geometric mean dabigatran peak plasma concentration, measured around 2 hours after 
94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate administration twice daily, was 175 ng/mL, with a range of 117-
275 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile range). The dabigatran geometric mean trough concentration, measured 
at trough in the morning, at the end of the dosing interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran 
evening dose), was on average 91.0 ng/mL, with a range of 61.0-143 ng/mL (25th-75th percentile 
range). 
For patients with NVAF treated for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism with 150 mg 
dabigatran etexilate twice daily, 
• 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after the 
previous dose) was about 200 ng/mL, 
an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 3-fold upper limit 
of normal refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 103 seconds, 
an aPTT ratio greater than 2-fold upper limit of normal (aPTT prolongation of about 80 seconds), 
at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) reflects the 90th percentile of observations. 
• 
• 
Treatment of DVT and PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE) 
In patients treated for DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily, the dabigatran 
geometric mean trough concentration, measured within 10-16 hours after dose, at the end of the dosing 
interval (i.e. 12 hours after the 150 mg dabigatran evening dose), was 59.7 ng/ml, with a range of 38.6-
94.5 ng/ml (25th-75th percentile range). For treatment of DVT and PE, with dabigatran etexilate 
150 mg twice daily, 
• 
• 
• 
the 90th percentile of dabigatran plasma concentrations measured at trough (10-16 hours after the 
previous dose) was about 146 ng/ml, 
an ECT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), elevated approximately 2.3-fold 
compared to baseline refers to the observed 90th percentile of ECT prolongation of 74 seconds, 
the 90th percentile of aPTT at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose) was 62 seconds, 
which would be 1.8-fold compared to baseline. 
In patients treated for prevention of recurrent of DVT and PE with 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice 
daily no pharmacokinetic data are available. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant ethnic differences among Caucasians, African-American, Hispanic, Japanese or 
Chinese patients were observed. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors 
The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate is derived from the RE-LY study 
(Randomised Evaluation of Long–term anticoagulant therapy) a multi-centre, multi-national, 
randomised parallel group study of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate (110 mg and 150 mg 
twice daily) compared to open-label warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk 
of stroke and systemic embolism. The primary objective in this study was to determine if dabigatran 
etexilate was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint stroke and 
systemic embolism. Statistical superiority was also analysed. 
In the RE-LY study, a total of 18 113 patients were randomised, with a mean age of 71.5 years and a 
mean CHADS2 score of 2.1. The patient population was 64 % male, 70 % Caucasian and 16 % Asian. 
For patients randomised to warfarin, the mean percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 
2-3) was 64.4 % (median TTR 67 %). 
The RE-LY study demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate, at a dose of 110 mg twice daily, is non-
inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in subjects with atrial 
fibrillation, with a reduced risk of ICH, total bleeding and major bleeding. The dose of 150 mg twice 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
daily reduces significantly the risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke, vascular death, ICH and total 
bleeding compared to warfarin. Major bleeding rates with this dose were comparable to warfarin. 
Myocardial infarction rates were slightly increased with dabigatran etexilate 110 mg twice daily and 
150 mg twice daily compared to warfarin (hazard ratio 1.29; p=0.0929 and hazard ratio 1.27; 
p=0.1240, respectively). With improving monitoring of INR the observed benefits of dabigatran 
etexilate compared to warfarin diminish.

For the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding there was an interaction of treatment effect and age. 
The relative risk of bleeding with dabigatran compared to warfarin increased with age. Relative risk 
was highest in patients ≥ 75 years. The concomitant use of antiplatelets ASA or clopidogrel 
approximately doubles MBE rates with both dabigatran etexilate and warfarin. There was no 
significant interaction of treatment effects with the subgroups of renal function and CHADS2 score.

RELY-ABLE (Long term multi-center extension of dabigatran treatment in patients with atrial 
fibrillation who completed the RE-LY trial) 
The RE-LY extension study (RELY-ABLE) provided additional safety information for a cohort of 
patients which continued the same dose of dabigatran etexilate as assigned in the RE-LY trial. Patients 
were eligible for the RELY-ABLE trial if they had not permanently discontinued study medicinal 
product at the time of their final RE-LY study visit. Enrolled patients continued to receive the same 
double-blind dabigatran etexilate dose randomly allocated in RE-LY, for up to 43 months of follow up 
after RE-LY (total mean follow-up RE-LY + RELY-ABLE, 4.5 years). There were 5 897 patients 
enrolled, representing 49 % of patients originally randomly assigned to receive dabigatran etexilate in 
RE-LY and 86 % of RELY-ABLE–eligible patients. 
During the additional 2.5 years of treatment in RELY-ABLE, with a maximum exposure of over 
6 years (total exposure in RELY + RELY-ABLE), the long-term safety profile of dabigatran etexilate 
was confirmed for both test doses 110 mg twice a day and 150 mg twice a day. No new safety findings 
were observed. 
The rates of outcome events including, major bleed and other bleeding events were consistent with 
those seen in RE-LY. 
Data from non-interventional studies 
A non-interventional study (GLORIA-AF) prospectively collected (in its second phase) safety and 
effectiveness data in newly diagnosed NVAF patients on dabigatran etexilate in a real-world setting. 
The study included 4 859 patients on dabigatran etexilate (55 % treated with 150 mg twice a day, 43 % 
treated with 110 mg twice a day, 2 % treated with 75 mg twice a day). Patients were followed-up for 
2 years. The mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were 1.9 and 1.2, respectively. Mean on-therapy 
follow-up time was 18.3 months. Major bleeding occurred in 0.97 per 100 patient-years. Life-
threatening bleeding was reported in 0.46 per 100 patient-years, intracranial haemorrhage in 0.17 per 
100 patient-years and gastrointestinal bleeding in 0.60 per 100 patient-years. Stroke occurred in 
0.65 per 100 patient-years. 
In addition, in a non-interventional study [Graham DJ et al., Circulation. 2015 ;131 :157-164] in more 
than 134 000 elderly patients with NVAF in the United States (contributing more than 37 500 patient-
years of on-therapy follow-up time) dabigatran etexilate (84 % patients treated with 150 mg twice a 
day, 16 % patients treated with 75 mg twice a day) was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic 
stroke (hazard ratio 0.80, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.67 – 0.96), intracranial haemorrhage (hazard 
ratio 0.34, CI 0.26 – 0.46), and mortality (hazard ratio 0.86, CI 0.77 – 0.96) and increased risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding (hazard ratio 1.28, CI 1.14 – 1.44) compared to warfarin. No difference was 
found for major bleeding (hazard ratio 0.97, CI 0.88 – 1.07). 
These observations in real-world settings are consistent with the established safety and efficacy profile 
for dabigatran etexilate in the RE-LY study in this indication. 
Patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation 
A prospective, randomised, open-label, multicenter, exploratory study with blinded, centrally 
adjudicated endpoint evaluation (RE-CIRCUIT) was conducted in 704 patients who were under stable 
anticoagulant treatment. The study compared 150 mg twice daily uninterrupted dabigatran etexilate 
with uninterrupted INR-adjusted warfarin in catheter ablation of paroxysmal or persistent atrial 
fibrillation. Of the 704 enrolled patients, 317 underwent atrial fibrillation ablation on uninterrupted 
dabigatran and 318 underwent atrial fibrillation ablation on uninterrupted warfarin. All patients 
underwent a Trans-oesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) prior to catheter ablation. The primary 
outcome (adjudicated major bleeding according to ISTH criteria) occurred in 5 (1.6 %) patients in the 
dabigatran etexilate group and 22 (6.9 %) patients in the warfarin group (risk difference-5.3 %; 95 % 
CI-8.4, - 2.2; P=0.0009). There was no stroke/systemic embolism/TIA (composite) event in the 
dabigatran etexilate arm, and one event (TIA) in the warfarin arm from the time of ablation and until 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 weeks post-ablation. This exploratory study showed that dabigatran etexilate was associated with a 
significant reduction in MBE rate compared with INR-adjusted warfarin in the setting of ablation. 
Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting 
A prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) study (Phase IIIb) to evaluate dual-
therapy with dabigatran etexilate (110 mg or 150 mg twice a day) plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor 
(P2Y12 antagonist) vs. triple-therapy with warfarin (adjusted to a INR 2.0 – 3.0) plus clopidogrel or 
ticagrelor and ASA was conducted in 2 725 patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation who 
underwent a PCI with stenting (RE-DUAL PCI). Patients were randomised to dabigatran etexilate 
110 mg twice a day dual-therapy, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice a day dual-therapy or warfarin 
triple-therapy. Elderly patients outside of the United States (≥ 80 years of age for all countries, 
≥ 70 years of age for Japan) were randomly assigned to the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg dual-therapy 
group or the warfarin triple-therapy group. The primary endpoint was a combined endpoint of major 
bleeds based on ISTH definition or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event. 
The incidence of the primary endpoint was 15.4 % (151 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 110 mg 
dual-therapy group as compared with 26.9 % (264 patients) in the warfarin triple-therapy group 
(HR 0.52; 95 % CI 0.42, 0.63; P< 0.0001 for non-inferiority and P< 0.0001 for superiority) and 20.2 % 
(154 patients) in the dabigatran etexilate 150 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 25.7 % 
(196 patients) in the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.72; 95 % CI 0.58, 0.88; 
P< 0.0001 for non-inferiority and P=0.002 for superiority). As part of the descriptive analysis, TIMI 
(Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) major bleeding events was lower in both dabigatran etexilate 
dual-therapy groups than in the warfarin triple-therapy group: 14 events (1.4 %) in the dabigatran 
etexilate 110 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 37 events (3.8 %) in the warfarin triple-therapy 
group (HR 0.37; 95 % CI 0.20, 0.68; P=0.002) and 16 events (2.1 %) in the dabigatran etexilate 
150 mg dual-therapy group as compared with 30 events (3.9 %) in the corresponding warfarin triple-
therapy group (HR 0.51; 95 % CI 0.28, 0.93; P=0.03). Both dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy groups 
had lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group: 
3 events (0.3 %) in the 110 mg dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 10 events 
(1.0 %) in the warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.30; 95 % CI 0.08, 1.07; P=0.06) and 1 event 
(0.1 %) in the 150 mg dabigatran etexilate dual-therapy group as compared with 8 events (1.0 %) in 
the corresponding warfarin triple-therapy group (HR 0.12; 95 % CI 0.02, 0.98; P=0.047). The 
incidence of the composite efficacy endpoint of death, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or systemic embolism) or unplanned revascularization in the two dabigatran etexilate dual-
therapy groups combined was non-inferior to the warfarin triple-therapy group (13.7 % vs. 13.4 % 
respectively; HR 1.04; 95 % CI: 0.84, 1.29; P=0.0047 for non-inferiority).There were no statistical 
differences in the individual components of the efficacy endpoints between either dabigatran etexilate 
dual-therapy groups and warfarin triple-therapy. 
This study demonstrated that dual-therapy with dabigatran etexilate and a P2Y12 antagonist 
significantly reduced the risk of bleeding vs. warfarin triple-therapy with non-inferiority for composite 
of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent a PCI with stenting. 
Treatment of DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE treatment) 
The efficacy and safety was investigated in two multi-center, randomised, double blind, parallel-group, 
replicate studies RE-COVER and RE-COVER II. These studies compared dabigatran etexilate 
(150 mg twice a day) with warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) in patients with acute DVT and/or PE. The 
primary objective of these studies was to determine if dabigatran etexilate was non-inferior to warfarin 
in reducing the occurrence of the primary endpoint which was the composite of recurrent symptomatic 
DVT and/or PE and related deaths within the 6 month treatment period. 
In the pooled RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies, a total of 5 153 patients were randomised 
and 5 107 were treated.

The duration of treatment with fixed dose of dabigatran was 174.0 days without coagulation 
monitoring. For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 2.0 to 3.0) 
was 60.6 %. 
The trials, demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior 
to the treatment with warfarin (non-inferiority margin for RE-COVER, and RE-COVER II: 3.6 for risk 
difference and 2.75 for hazard ratio).

Prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (DVT/PE prevention) 
Two randomised, parallel group, double-blind studies were performed in patients previously treated 
with anticoagulation therapy. RE-MEDY, warfarin controlled study, enrolled patients already treated 
for 3 to 12 months with the need for further anticoagulant treatment and RE-SONATE, the placebo 
controlled study, enrolled patients already treated for 6 to 18 months with Vitamin K inhibitors. 
The objective of the RE-MEDY study was to compare the safety and efficacy of oral dabigatran 
etexilate (150 mg twice a day) to warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) for the long-term treatment and 
prevention of recurrent, symptomatic DVT and/or PE. A total of 2 866 patients were randomised and 
2 856 patients were treated. Duration of dabigatran etexilate treatment ranged from 6 to 36 months 
(median 534.0 days). For patients randomised to warfarin, the median time in therapeutic range (INR 
2.0-3.0) was 64.9 %. 
RE-MEDY demonstrated that treatment with dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily was non-inferior 
to warfarin (non-inferiority margin: 2.85 for hazard ratio and 2.8 for risk difference).

The objective of the RE-SONATE study was to evaluate superiority of dabigatran etexilate versus 
placebo for the prevention of recurrent symptomatic DVT and/or PE in patients who had already 
completed 6 to 18 months of treatment with VKA. The intended therapy was 6 months dabigatran 
etexilate 150 mg twice daily without need for monitoring. 
RE-SONATE demonstrated dabigatran etexilate was superior to placebo for the prevention of 
recurrent symptomatic DVT/PE events including unexplained deaths, with a risk reduction from 5.6 % 
to 0.4 % (relative risk reduction 92 % based on hazard ratio) during the treatment period (p< 0.0001). 
All secondary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints showed 
superiority of dabigatran etexilate over placebo. 
The study included observational follow-up for 12 months after the conclusion of treatment. After 
discontinuation of study medicinal product the effect was maintained until the end of the follow-up, 
indicating that the initial treatment effect of dabigatran etexilate was sustained. No rebound effect was 
observed. At the end of the follow-up VTE events in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate was 
6.9 % vs. 10.7 % among the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.61 (95 % CI 0.42, 0.88), p=0.0082).

Clinical trials for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves 
A phase II study examined dabigatran etexilate and warfarin in a total of 252 patients with recent 
mechanical valve replacement surgery (i.e. within the current hospital stay) and in patients who 
received a mechanical heart valve replacement more than three months ago. More thromboembolic 
events (mainly strokes and symptomatic/asymptomatic prosthetic valve thrombosis) and more 
bleeding events were observed with dabigatran etexilate than with warfarin. In the early post-operative 
patients, major bleeding manifested predominantly as haemorrhagic pericardial effusions, specifically 
in patients who started dabigatran etexilate early (i.e. on day 3) after heart valve replacement surgery 
(see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing dabigatran etexilate in all subsets of the paediatric population 
for the indication of prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
The DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate 
compared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less 
than 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, 
non-inferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomised according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-
appropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate (doses 
adjusted for age and weight) or SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or vitamin 
K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old). The primary endpoint was a composite 
endpoint of patients with complete thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom 
from mortality related to VTE. Exclusion criteria included active meningitis, encephalitis and 
intracranial abscess. 
In total, 267 patients had been randomised. Of those, 176 patients were treated with dabigatran 
etexilate and 90 patients according to SOC (1 randomised patient was not treated). 168 patients were 
12 to less than 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to less than 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than 
2 years. 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 38 patients 
(42.2 %) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus 
resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The 
corresponding rate difference demonstrated non-inferiority of dabigatran etexilate to SOC. Consistent 
results were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the 
treatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the 
3 different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the 
dabigatran etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1 %) and 7/13 (53.8 %) for patients 
from birth to < 2 years, 21/43 (48.8 %) and 12/21 (57.1 %) for patients aged 2 to < 12 years, and 
47/112 (42.0 %) and 19/56 (33.9 %) for patients aged 12 to < 18 years. 
Adjudicated major bleeds were reported for 4 patients (2.3 %) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 
2 patients (2.2 %) in the SOC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first 
major bleeding event. Thirty-eight patients (21.6 %) in the dabigatran etexilate arm and 22 patients 
(24.4 %) in the SOC arm had any adjudicated bleeding event, most of them categorised as minor. The 
combined endpoint of adjudicated major bleeding event (MBE) or clinically relevant non-major 
(CRNM) bleeding (on treatment) was reported for 6 (3.4 %) patients in the dabigatran etexilate group 
and 3 (3.3 %) patients in the SOC group. 
An open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was 
conducted to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the 
presence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least 
3 months) or after completing the DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. 
Eligible patients received age and weight adjusted doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, 
coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a 
maximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study included the recurrence of VTE, major 
and minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic 
events) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an independent blinded adjudication 
committee. 
Overall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less than 
18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients in age 
stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4 %) 
had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. 
Adjudication-confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients 
(22.5 %) within the first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients 
(1.4 %), an adjudication-confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For 
3 patients (1.4 %), adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months.  
No on-treatment deaths occurred. During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4 %) developed 
post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of PTS within the first 12 months. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After oral administration, dabigatran etexilate is rapidly and completely converted to dabigatran, 
which is the active form in plasma. The cleavage of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate by esterase-
catalysed hydrolysis to the active principle dabigatran is the predominant metabolic reaction. The 
absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of dabigatran etexilate was 
approximately 6.5 %. 
After oral administration of dabigatran etexilate in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic profile of 
dabigatran in plasma is characterised by a rapid increase in plasma concentrations with Cmax attained 
within 0.5 and 2.0 hours post administration. 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
A study evaluating post-operative absorption of dabigatran etexilate, 1-3 hours following surgery, 
demonstrated relatively slow absorption compared with that in healthy volunteers, showing a smooth 
plasma concentration-time profile without high peak plasma concentrations. Peak plasma 
concentrations are reached at 6 hours following administration in a postoperative period due to 
contributing factors such as anaesthesia, gastrointestinal paresis, and surgical effects independent of 
the oral medicinal product formulation. It was demonstrated in a further study that slow and delayed 
absorption is usually only present on the day of surgery. On subsequent days absorption of dabigatran 
is rapid with peak plasma concentrations attained 2 hours after medicinal product administration. 
Food does not affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate but delays the time to peak plasma 
concentrations by 2 hours. 
Cmax and AUC were dose proportional. 
The oral bioavailability may be increased by 75 % after a single dose and 37 % at steady state 
compared to the reference capsule formulation when the pellets are taken without the 
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule shell. Hence, the integrity of the HPMC capsules 
should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally increased bioavailability of 
dabigatran etexilate (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Low (34-35 %) concentration independent binding of dabigatran to human plasma proteins was 
observed. The volume of distribution of dabigatran of 60-70 L exceeded the volume of total body 
water indicating moderate tissue distribution of dabigatran. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism and excretion of dabigatran were studied following a single intravenous dose of 
radiolabeled dabigatran in healthy male subjects. After an intravenous dose, the dabigatran-derived 
radioactivity was eliminated primarily in the urine (85 %). Faecal excretion accounted for 6 % of the 
administered dose. Recovery of the total radioactivity ranged from 88-94 % of the administered dose 
by 168 hours post dose. 
Dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides. Four 
positional isomers, 1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 4-O-acylglucuronide exist, each accounts for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. Traces of other metabolites were only detectable with highly sensitive analytical 
methods. Dabigatran is eliminated primarily in the unchanged form in the urine, at a rate of 
approximately 100 mL/min corresponding to the glomerular filtration rate. 
Elimination 
Plasma concentrations of dabigatran showed a biexponential decline with a mean terminal half-life of 
11 hours in healthy elderly subjects. After multiple doses a terminal half-life of about 12-14 hours was 
observed. The half-life was independent of dose. Half-life is prolonged if renal function is impaired as 
shown in table 25. 
Special populations 
Renal insufficiency 
In phase I studies the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of dabigatran 
etexilate is approximately 2.7-fold higher in adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL 
between 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without renal insufficiency. 
104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 10-30 mL/min), the 
exposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life approximately 
2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency (see sections 4.2, 4.3 
and 4.4).

function.

27.2 (15.3 %; 21.6-35.0) 
Additionally, dabigatran exposure (at trough and peak) was assessed in a prospective open label 
randomised pharmacokinetic study in NVAF patients with severe renal impairment (defined as 
creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-30 mL/min) receiving dabigatran etexilate 75 mg twice daily. This 
regimen resulted in a geometric mean trough concentration of 155 ng/ml (gCV of 76.9 %), measured 
immediately before administration of the next dose and in a geometric mean peak concentration of 
202 ng/ml (gCV of 70.6 %) measured two hours after the administration of the last dose. 
Clearance of dabigatran by haemodialysis was investigated in 7 adult patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) without atrial fibrillation. Dialysis was conducted with 700 mL/min dialysate flow 
rate, four hour duration and a blood flow rate of either 200 mL/min or 350-390 mL/min. This resulted 
in a removal of 50 % to 60 % of dabigatran concentrations, respectively. The amount of substance 
cleared by dialysis is proportional to the blood flow rate up to a blood flow rate of 300 mL/min. The 
anticoagulant activity of dabigatran decreased with decreasing plasma concentrations and the PK/PD 
relationship was not affected by the procedure. 
The median CrCL in RE-LY was 68.4 mL/min. Almost half (45.8 %) of the RE-LY patients had a 
CrCL> 50-< 80 mL/min. Patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL between 30-50 mL/min) had 
on average 2.29-fold and 1.81-fold higher pre-and post-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations, 
respectively, when compared with patients without renal impairment (CrCL ≥ 80 mL/min). 
The median CrCL in the RE-COVER study was 100.4 mL/min. 21.7 % of patients had mild renal 
impairment (CrCL > 50 -< 80 mL/min) and 4.5 % of patients had a moderate renal impairment (CrCL 
between 30 and 50 mL/min). Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment had at steady state an 
average 1.8-fold and 3.6-fold higher pre-dose dabigatran plasma concentrations compared with 
patients with CrCL > 80 mL/min, respectively. Similar values for CrCL were found in RE-COVER II. 
The median CrCL in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies were 99.0 mL/min and 99.7 mL/min, 
respectively. 22.9 % and 22.5 % of the patients had a CrCL > 50-< 80 mL/min, and 4.1 % and 4.8 % 
had a CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min in the RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies. 
Elderly patients 
Specific pharmacokinetic phase I studies with elderly subjects showed an increase of 40 to 60 % in the 
AUC and of more than 25 % in Cmax compared to young subjects. 
The effect by age on exposure to dabigatran was confirmed in the RE-LY study with an about 31 % 
higher trough concentration for subjects ≥ 75 years and by about 22 % lower trough level for subjects 
< 65 years compared to subjects between 65 and 75 years (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No change in dabigatran exposure was seen in 12 adult subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency 
(Child Pugh B) compared to 12 controls (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Body weight 
The dabigatran trough concentrations were about 20 % lower in adult patients with a body weight 
> 100 kg compared with 50-100 kg. The majority (80.8 %) of the subjects were in the ≥ 50 kg and 
< 100 kg category with no clear difference detected (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Limited clinical data in 
adult patients < 50 kg are available. 
Gender 
In atrial fibrillation patients females had on average 30 % higher trough and post-dose concentrations. 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 4.2). 
Ethnic origin 
No clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences among Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, 
Japanese or Chinese patients were observed regarding dabigatran pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics. 
Paediatric population 
Oral administration of dabigatran etexilate according to the protocol defined dosing algorithm resulted 
in exposure within the range observed in adults with DVT/PE. Based on the pooled analysis of 
pharmacokinetic data of studies DIVERSITY and 1 160.108, the observed geometric mean trough 
exposures were 53.9 ng/mL, 63.0 ng/mL and 99.1 ng/mL in 0 to < 2-year-old, 2 to < 12-year-old and 
12 to < 18-year-old paediatric VTE patients, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
In vitro interaction studies did not show any inhibition or induction of the principal isoenzymes of 
cytochrome P450. This has been confirmed by in vivo studies with healthy volunteers, who did not 
show any interaction between this treatment and the following active substances: atorvastatin 
(CYP3A4), digoxin (P-gp transporter interaction) and diclofenac (CYP2C9). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Effects observed in the repeated dose toxicity studies were due to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of dabigatran. 
An effect on female fertility was observed in the form of a decrease in implantations and an increase in 
pre-implantation loss at 70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were 
toxic to the mothers (5-to 10-fold the plasma exposure level in patients), a decrease in foetal body 
weight and viability along with an increase in foetal variations were observed in rats and rabbits. In the 
pre-and post-natal study, an increase in foetal mortality was observed at doses that were toxic to the 
dams (a dose corresponding to a plasma exposure level 4-fold higher than observed in patients). 
In a juvenile toxicity study conducted in Han Wistar rats, mortality was associated with bleeding 
events at similar exposures, at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile 
rats, mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in 
association with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile 
106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
toxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in toxicity, nor any toxicity specific to 
juvenile animals.

Take Dabigatran etexilate Accord as recommended for the following conditions: 
Prevention of blood clot formation after knee or hip replacement surgery 
The recommended dose is 220 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg). 
If your kidney function is decreased by more than half or if you are 75 years of age or older, the 
recommended dose is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg). 
If you are taking amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil containing medicines the recommended dose 
is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg). 
If you are taking verapamil containing medicines and your kidney function is decreased by more 
than half, you should be treated with a reduced dose of 75 mg Dabigatran etexilate Accord because 
your bleeding risk may be increased. 
For both surgery types, treatment should not be started if there is bleeding from the site of operation. If 
the treatment cannot be started until the day after surgery, dosing should be started with 2 capsules 
once a day. 
After knee replacement surgery 
You should start treatment with Dabigatran etexilate Accord within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, 
taking a single capsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 10 days. 
After hip replacement surgery 
You should start treatment with Dabigatran etexilate Accord within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, 
taking a single capsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 28-35 days. 
Treatment of blood clots and prevention of blood clots from reoccurring in children 
Dabigatran etexilate Accord should be taken twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the 
evening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 12 hours 
as possible. 
The recommended dose depends on weight and age. Your doctor will determine the correct dose. 
Your doctor may adjust the dose as treatment progresses. Keep using all other medicines, unless your 
doctor tells you to stop using any.

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
Take Dabigatran etexilate Accord as recommended for the following conditions: 
Prevention of blood clot formation after knee or hip replacement surgery 
The recommended dose is 220 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 110 mg). 
If your kidney function is decreased by more than half or if you are 75 years of age or older, the 
recommended dose is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg). 
If you are taking amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil containing medicines the recommended dose 
is 150 mg once a day (taken as 2 capsules of 75 mg). 
If you are taking verapamil containing medicines and your kidney function is decreased by more 
than half, you should be treated with a reduced dose of 75 mg Dabigatran etexilate Accord because 
your bleeding risk may be increased. 
For both surgery types, treatment should not be started if there is bleeding from the site of operation. If 
the treatment cannot be started until the day after surgery, dosing should be started with 2 capsules 
once a day. 
After knee replacement surgery 
You should start treatment with Dabigatran etexilate Accord within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, 
taking a single capsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 10 days.

You should start treatment with Dabigatran etexilate Accord within 1-4 hours after surgery finishes, 
taking a single capsule. Thereafter two capsules once a day should be taken for a total of 28-35 days. 
Prevention of brain or body vessel obstruction by blood clot formation developing after abnormal heart 
beats and Treatment of blood clots in the veins of your legs and lungs including prevention of blood 
clots from re-occurring in the vein of your legs and lungs 
The recommended dose is 300 mg taken as one 150 mg capsule twice a day. 
If you are 80 years or older, the recommended dose is 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice a 
day. 
If you are taking verapamil containing medicines, you should be treated with a reduced Dabigatran 
etexilate Accord dose of 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice a day, because your bleeding risk 
may be increased. 
If you have a potentially higher risk for bleeding, your doctor may decide to prescribe a dose of 
Dabigatran etexilate Accord 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice a day. 
You can continue to take this medicine if your heart beat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure 
called cardioversion. Take Dabigatran etexilate Accord as your physician has told you.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Dabigatran etexilate Accord affects blood clotting, so most side effects are related to signs such as 
bruising or bleeding. Major or severe bleeding may occur, these constitute the most serious side effects 
and, regardless of location, may become disabling, life-threatening or even lead to death. In some cases 
these bleedings may not be obvious. 
If you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of excessive 
bleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling) 
consult your doctor immediately. Your doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or 
change your medicine. 
Tell your doctor immediately, if you experience a serious allergic reaction which causes difficulty in

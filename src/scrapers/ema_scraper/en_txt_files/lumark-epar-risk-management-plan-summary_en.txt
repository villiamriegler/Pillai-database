Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lumark. The RMP details important risks of 
Lumark. 
Lumark summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Lumark should be used. 
This summary of RMP for Lumark should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the EPAR. 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lumark’s RMP. 
The Medicine and what it is used for 
I 
Lumark is a radiolabelling precursor and as no direct indication. Once link to the appropriate 
ligand/carrier, Lumark can be used in several oncologic indications depending on the carrier to which 
Lumark is linked.  
Further information about the evaluation of Lumark’s benefits can be found in Lumark’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/lumark#product-information-section. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
II 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Lumark, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Lumark's risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:  
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;  
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;  
• The authorised pack size the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine 
is used correctly;  
• The medicine’s legal status the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.  
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
Information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Lumark are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
 
 
 
link with the use of Lumark. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the 
medicine);

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  
In this section of the SmPC General warnings and Radiation protection information 
are provided.  
In summary, Lutetium(177Lu)-labelled medicinal product should be prepared by the 
user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality 
requirements and their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to 
the regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official authorities. 
Administration of a high activity (7.400 MBq) of the Lutetium(177Lu)-labelled 
medicinal product results in an average radiation dose rate at 1 m distance from 
the patient of 4-11 µSv/h after 24 hours. This is below the threshold considered 
acceptable for discharge from the clinic (20 µSv/h). For a person in the vicinity of 
the patient, assuming continuous exposure at 2 m and infinite biological half-life 
(no disposal by the patient after discharge from the hospital), this dose rate will 
result in an overall dose of approximately 0.6 mSv, which is approximately one 
half of the dose limit set for general public (1 mSv/year).  
6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Within this section additional general warning are provided including instruction to: 
-  Not use product when the integrity of the container is compromised 
- 
Put in place administration procedures with the aim to minimise the risk 
of contamination 
Follow local requirements for unused product or waste material 
- 
12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
Within this section of the SmPC, it is recommended to measure activity using an 
ionisation chamber under geometric conditions which have been appropriately 
validated.  
Usual precautions regarding sterility (throughout the labelling procedures) and 
radioactivity should be respected.  
The vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding. The 
product should be aseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilized single 
use needle and syringe after disinfection of the stopper.

4.3 Contraindications 
- Pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential […] Before the use of 177Lu -labelled medicinal 
products, pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test. 
Pregnancy:  The use of 177Lu -labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during 
established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see 
section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding: […] If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding 
should be interrupted and the expressed feeds discarded. 
Fertility:  According to literature reports and taking a conservative approach 
(maximum patient dose of 10 GBq, average labeling yield and no additional 
measures), it may be considered that 177Lu-labelled medicinal products do not lead to 
reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male testes or genetic 
damage in male testes or female ovaries. 
Further information concerning the use of 177Lu-labelled medicinal products is 
specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled.

4.1 Therapeutic indications 
Lumark is a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It is not intended for direct use in 
patients. This medicinal product must be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier 
molecules, which have been specifically developed for radiolabelling with this 
radionuclide. 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Lumark is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling. 
… 
Method of administration Lumark is intended for in vitro radiolabelling of medicinal 
products, which are subsequently administered by the approved route. 
Lumark should not be administered directly to the patient. 
For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before 
administration, see section 12. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
... 
Individual benefit/risk justification Lumark is not to be administered directly to the 
patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as 
monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates. 
... 
Specific warnings 
... 
Radioactive medicinal products should be prepared by the user in a manner which 
satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate 
aseptic precautions should be taken. 
6.2 Incompatibilities 
Radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other 
substrates, with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace 
metal impurities. 
It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc, used for the preparation of the 
radiolabelled medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such 
trace metal impurities. Only syringe needles (for example nonmetallic) 
with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to minimize trace metal impurity 
levels. 
In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with 
medicinal products other than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled. 
6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Lumark is not intended for direct use in patients. 
… 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation 
safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate 
aseptic precautions should be taken. 
For instruction on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before 
administration, see section 12. 
12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, in order to maintain the sterility of 
Lumark and to maintain sterility throughout the labelling procedures. 
The complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with 177LuCl3. 
Free 177LuCl3 is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result 
in osteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to 
intravenous administration of 177Lu-labeled conjugates in order to form a complex 
with free 177Lu, if present, leading to a rapid renal clearance of 177Lu.

Brief description of the 
product
Chemical class:  a humanized immunoglobulin g4-proline, alanine, alanine 
(IgG4-PAA) bispecific antibody
Summary of mode of action:
Talquetamab is a IgG4-PAA bispecific antibody directed against G protein-
coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) and the CD3 
receptors on T cells.
Talquetamab promotes enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity through 
recruitment of CD3-expressing T cells to GPRC5D-expressing cells. This 
leads to the activation of T cells and induces subsequent lysis of 
GPRC5D-expressing cells mediated by secreted perforin and various 
granzymes stored in the secretory vesicles of cytotoxic T cells. Based on the 
expression of GPRC5D on plasma cells, with minimal to no expression 
detected on B cells and B cell precursors, talquetamab targets multiple 
myeloma cells particularly.
Important information about its composition:
Talquetamab is a humanized IgG4-PAA bispecific antibody produced in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology.

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI:  Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
Indication(s)
Multiple myeloma is a rare, malignant plasma cell disorder that represents approximately 1% to 
1.8% of all new cancer cases and approximately 10% of hematological malignancies (Sung 2021; 
SEER 2021). The disease is considered incurable (Rajkumar 2020).
Incidence:
In 2020, an estimated 176,404 patients were diagnosed with multiple myeloma globally, with a 
crude incidence rate of 2.3 cases per 100,000 persons and a world population age-standardized 
incidence rate of 1.8 cases per 100,000 persons (Ferlay 2020).
In the EU (27 countries), the 2020 crude incidence rate was 8.0 cases per 100,000 persons, and the 
European population age-adjusted incidence rate was 7.5 cases per 100,000 persons (ECIS 2021). 
The  estimated  number  of  new  cases  for  the  EU  overall  was  35,842.  Similarly,  the  annual 
age-adjusted incidence rate was 7.1 per 100,000 in the UK with 4,650 cases (HMRN 2022). In 
general,  Western  Europe  had  the  highest  incidence  rates  of  multiple  myeloma,  with  a  crude 
incidence rate of 9.2 per 100,000 persons (ECIS 2021). Crude incidence rates ranged from 2.5 per 
100,000 persons in Bulgaria to 10.3 per 100,000 persons in France.
Prevalence:
Worldwide, the estimated 5-year prevalence in 2020 was approximately 450,579 patients (Ferlay 
2020).  In  Europe,  the  5-year  prevalence  count  of  multiple  myeloma  was  138,083  persons. 
Estimates for 10-year or total prevalence count and proportions of multiple myeloma are available 
from select European countries with longer data collection, as shown in Table SI.1. The prevalence 
data for France, Germany, Italy, and Spain are estimated for 2022 using 10 years of collected or 
projected  data,  as  described  by  Kantar  Health’s  Cancer  MPact®  program  methods.  The  UK 
10-year  prevalence  and  Nordic  countries’  total  prevalence  comes  from  their  respective  cancer 
registry estimates in 2016.

17 November 2023
The prevalence of multiple myeloma has increased in the past few decades due to better diagnostic 
techniques and improved patient survival, owing to widespread use of autologous hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation and the development of novel therapeutic agents (Turesson 2018).
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication - Age, Sex, Racial and/or Ethnic 
Origin, and Risk Factors for the Disease
Age: The median age at multiple myeloma diagnosis is approximately 69 to 71 years (SEER 2021; 
Palumbo 2011). Myeloma incidence is strongly related to age, with older adults experiencing the 
highest incidence rates. At diagnosis, 36% of patients are younger than 65 years, 31% are aged 65 
to 74 years, and 33% are 75 years of age or older (SEER 2021).
Gender: The incidence of multiple myeloma is approximately 1.5 times higher in men than women 
(Blimark 2018). Globally in 2020, the age-standardized incidence rate of multiple myeloma was 
estimated to be 2.2 per 100,000 in men and 1.5 per 100,000 in women (Sung 2021). In the EU 
27 countries in 2020, the incidence rates are 9.2 per 100,000 in men versus 6.9 per 100,000 in 
women (ECIS 2022).
Racial and ethnic origin: The incidence of multiple myeloma is 2 times higher in Black individuals 
than in White individuals but is lower in Asian and Hispanic individuals versus White persons 
(SEER*Explorer 2021). In the US, the average incidence rate from 2014 to 2018 was 13.8 per 
100,000  for  Blacks  and  6.5  per  100,000  persons  for  Whites  (SEER  2021).  Evidence  from  US 
studies suggests that the racial disparity may be influenced by differences in risk factors for MGUS 
and transformation of MGUS to multiple myeloma between Black and White patients (Marinac 
2020).
Other  risk  factors  for  multiple  myeloma: Although  there  is  a  notably higher  risk  of  multiple 
myeloma in older adults, men, and Black individuals, there is limited evidence on the underlying 
social, biological, or genetic factors increasing the risk of multiple myeloma in these populations. 
In  a  large  case-control  study,  the  odds  of  multiple  myeloma  were  elevated  in  patients  whose 
relatives  had  any  hematologic  malignancy  versus  none  (odds  ratio  1.89;  95%  CI:  1.25,  2.86), 
suggesting  that  family  history  of  hematologic  malignancies  is  a  potential  predictor  of  disease 
(VanValkenburg  2016).  Other  potential  risk  factors  for  developing  multiple  myeloma  include 
being overweight or obese, having workplace exposure to chemicals or pesticides, and increased 
alcohol intake (Perrotta 2013; Sergentanis 2015).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
Treatments  approved  for  multiple  myeloma  vary  by  country  and  patient  population  (newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma versus relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma). The treatment options 
approved in the EU include the following:


Stem cell transplant (usually autologous but allogeneic is a later-line option)
agents 
Chemotherapeutic 
bendamustine, doxorubicin);
(melphalan,  vincristine, 
cyclophosphamide, 
etoposide, 
 Histone deacetylase inhibitors (panobinostat);

Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1

 Monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab);


Immunomodulatory imide drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide);
Proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, ixazomib, carfilzomib);
 Nuclear export inhibitor (selinexor);

Peptide-drug conjugate (melflufen);
 Antibody-drug conjugate (belantamab mafodotin);



CAR-T products (idecabtagene vicleucel, ciltacabtagene autoleucel);
Bispecific antibody (teclistamab);
Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisone, prednisone).
In  US  and  European  guidelines,  treatment  approaches  depend  on  patient  fitness  and  risk  of 
toxicities  (NCCN  2021;  Dimopoulos  2021).  The  initial  evaluation  of  patients  includes  an 
assessment of eligibility for high-dose therapy and ASCT based on age, performance status, and 
comorbidities.  Transplant  eligible  patients  will  typically  receive  induction  therapy  followed  by 
high-dose  chemotherapy  and  ASCT;  consolidation  and/or  maintenance  therapy  is  utilized  after 
ASCT depending upon the country. ESMO-recommended initial therapy for transplant ineligible 
patients  is  a  lenalidomide- or  bortezomib-containing  regimen  with  or  without  daratumumab 
(Dimopoulos 2021). Bisphosphonate treatment is  often started along with therapy to treat bone 
disease (Terpos 2013). If the areas of damaged bone continue to cause symptoms, radiation therapy 
may be used.
Despite advances in treatment options, multiple myeloma remains incurable in the vast majority 
of  cases  and  is  characterized  by  patterns  of  remissions  and  relapses  until  death.  With  each 
successive relapse and new line of treatment, the chance of response, duration of response, and 
median  OS  typically  decreases  (Gandhi  2019).  A  recent  prospective  observational  study 
(LocoMMotion)  evaluated  the  outcomes  of  248 patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple 
myeloma  who  were  triple  class  exposed  (Mateos  2022).  The  study  enrolled  patients  from 
10 countries; patients had to have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy or be considered double 
refractory  to  a  PI  and  an  IMiD.  All  patients  were  triple  class  exposed,  74%  were  triple  class 
refractory, and 93% were refractory to the last line of therapy. The ORR was 30%. With a median 
duration of follow up of 11 months, the median duration of response was 7.4 months, the median 
PFS was 4.6 months, and the median OS was 12.4 months. Similar to the prospective study, an 
earlier retrospective medical record review of 275 patients from 14 academic institutions in the 
United States found that patients who were refractory to anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies had a 
dismal  prognosis.  The  median  OS  for  the  entire  cohort  was  8.6  months  (95%  CI:  7.5,  9.9) 
(Gandhi 2019). Patients who became refractory to anti-CD38 therapy and received ≥1 subsequent 
treatment had an ORR of 31%, with a median PFS and median OS of 3.4 months and 9.3 months, 
respectively. The median OS for patients who received no further treatment was 1.3 months.

Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
Multiple myeloma is one of multiple disorders termed plasma cell dyscrasias (Kyle 2018). Plasma 
cell  dyscrasias  are  a  spectrum  of  progressively  more  severe  monoclonal  gammopathies,  which 
range from pre-malignant conditions, such as MGUS and SMM, to paraneoplastic conditions, like 
AL  amyloidosis  and  POEMS  syndrome,  to  malignant  conditions,  like  Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia and  multiple myeloma. Patients diagnosed with MGUS  are 3.1 times more 
likely to develop multiple myeloma in 20 years than those without MGUS. Almost all cases of 
multiple myeloma evolve from the MGUS precursor stage (Landgren 2009; Kyle 2018). Over 50% 
of  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  had  MGUS  for  at  least  10  years  before 
progression  (Kyle  2018).  The  risk  of  progression  to  multiple  myeloma  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately 1% per year (Landgren 2009).
Another plasma cell dyscrasia preceding active multiple myeloma is SMM, an asymptomatic stage 
of  disease  without  end  organ  damage.  SMM progresses  to  multiple  myeloma  at  a  rate  of 
approximately 10% per year over the first 5 years following diagnosis, 3% per year over the next 
5 years, and 1.5% per year thereafter (Kyle 2007; Ghobrial 2014).
In Europe, there were an estimated 23,275 deaths from multiple myeloma in 2020 (ECIS 2021). 
Multiple myeloma is the 17th most common cause of death in the 27 EU countries, with an age-
standardized  mortality  rate  of  4.8  per  100,000  (ECIS  2021).  The  5-year  relative  survival  for 
multiple myeloma patients ranged from 45.6% to 60.3% in Nordic countries (NORDCAN 2021). 
Five-year survival decreases as age increases. For example, the 5-year relative survival in Sweden 
was 66% for patients 65 years and younger and 39% for patients >65 years (Blimark 2018). The 
median OS was approximately 4.6 years in the Swedish Myeloma Registry in 2016.
Multiple  factors  are  considered  in  risk  stratification  for  multiple  myeloma.  The  ISS  and 
Durie-Salmon staging are both older tools that stratify patients according to patient characteristics 
and  tumor  burden  (Greipp  2005;  Durie  1975).  Updated  evidence  suggests  that  cytogenetic 
abnormalities seen in myeloma cells are one of the strongest predictors of tumor aggressiveness. 
The R-ISS was introduced as a risk stratification tool for multiple myeloma in 2015 and considers 
patient cytogenetic risk factors along with serum  lactate dehydrogenase levels,  serum albumin, 
and serum beta-2-microglobulin (Palumbo 2015). In 11 pooled trials, the 5-year OS rate was 82% 
in the R-ISS I, 62% in the R-ISS II, and 40% in the R-ISS III groups at a median follow-up of 
46 months.
High  risk  cytogenetic  abnormalities  in  the  R-ISS  include  t  (4;14),  t (14;16),  or  del(17p) 
(Palumbo 2015; Rajkumar 2020). The presence of del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), gain 1q, or 
p53 mutation is considered high-risk multiple myeloma. The presence of any 2 high risk factors is 
considered  double-hit  myeloma,  and  3 or  more  high  risk  factors  is  triple-hit  myeloma 
(Rajkumar 2022). Patients with standard risk multiple myeloma have an estimated median survival 
of 7 to 10 years, while patients with high-risk cytogenetics have a median survival closer to 5 years 
(Rajan 2015). As new treatments are introduced, the difference in survival is narrowing between 
patients  with  standard  risk  cytogenetics  and  certain  high-risk  cytogenetic  abnormalities,  like 
10
Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1
17 November 2023
del(17p),  suggesting  that  individual  cytogenetic  abnormalities  should  be  considered  in  risk 
stratification (Rajkumar 2020).
Multiple myeloma is defined as clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10%, or biopsy-proven bony 
or extramedullary plasmacytoma, and evidence of myeloma defining events. These include either 
end  organ  damage,  including  CRAB  or  biomarkers  of  malignancy  (Rajkumar  2020).  Tumor-
induced bone destruction and the resulting bone  disease  is  the main cause of  morbidity during 
multiple myeloma.
Important Co-morbidities: 
Compared with a matched general population, patients with multiple myeloma have significantly 
higher  odds  of  the  following  comorbidities  that  are  unrelated  to  the  disease  in  the  year  before 
multiple  myeloma  diagnosis:  congestive  heart  failure,  connective  tissue  disease,  dementia, 
inflammatory  bowel  disease,  ulcers,  mild  liver  disease,  chronic  pulmonary  disease,  diabetes 
mellitus  with  chronic  complications,  metastatic  solid  tumors,  and  lymphoma  (Gregersen  2017; 
Sverrisdóttir 2021). Moderate to severe lung disease is an important predictor for survival that is 
unrelated to multiple myeloma and included in the revised multiple myeloma comorbidity index 
(Engelhardt 2017).

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SII:  Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification
The nonclinical safety program  for talquetamab included an exploratory 4-week  IV tolerability 
study in cynomolgus monkey, a single-dose SC local tolerability GLP study in New Zealand White 
rabbits, an in vitro binding profile in a human protein cell array, a tissue cross-reactivity GLP study 
in normal human tissues, human serum and blood compatibility assays, and cytokine release assays 
in normal human blood. Further nonclinical safety studies with talquetamab in the cynomolgus 
monkey  were  not  considered  useful  for  human  risk  assessment  because  talquetamab  had  no 
adverse  findings  in  the  tolerability  study  and  lacked  comparable  cross-reactivity  in  common 
toxicology  species  relative  to  human.  Therefore,  hazard  identification  studies,  ie,  a  2-week  IV 
tolerability  study  and  a  pivotal  1-month  IV  toxicity  GLP  study  in  cynomolgus  monkey,  were 
conducted  with  a  tool  molecule,  JNJ-64024701,  that  has  similar  binding  affinity  and  in  vitro 
functional activity against cynomolgus monkey GPRC5D-expressing cells as that of talquetamab 
against human GPRC5D-expressing cells. 
Talquetamab, an antibody developed for an advanced cancer indication, is not expected to interact 
with DNA; therefore, no genotoxicity testing or carcinogenicity assessment is required. No chronic 
the  tool  molecule, 
or  sub-chronic  toxicology  studies  are  planned  with  talquetamab  or
JNJ-64024701,  due  to  the  lack  of  pharmacodynamic  responses  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  and 
production of ADA in ≥50% of animals dosed with talquetamab and >80% of animals dosed with 
the  tool  molecule  with  subsequent  loss  of  exposure  within  28  days  of  dosing.  No  in  vivo
developmental and reproductive toxicology studies are planned, and reproductive risk has been 
assessed through a weight-of-evidence approach. 
Key Safety Findings
Relevance to Human Usage
Toxicity
Single & repeat-dose toxicity
No single-dose toxicity studies were 
conducted. 
In cynomolgus monkeys, 4 weekly IV doses up 
to 30 mg/kg of talquetamab or the tool 
molecule (JNJ-64407564) were well tolerated, 
with no or weak pharmacodynamic activity 
and no adverse effects.
Reproductive toxicity
No reproductive toxicity studies were 
conducted.a
The lack of adverse findings in healthy monkeys 
administered talquetamab or the tool molecule may 
not fully represent the potential toxicities of 
talquetamab in patients.
Conducting reproductive toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys would not be warranted and 
conducting these studies would not be feasible nor 
further inform our understanding of the pregnancy 
risk to patients in this treatment population.a

Relevance to Human Usage
Conducting developmental reproductive toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys would not be 
warranted and conducting these studies would not be 
feasible nor further inform our understanding of the 
pregnancy risk to patients in this treatment 
population.a
Genotoxicity
Routine genotoxicity studies are generally not 
applicable to biological pharmaceuticals as 
large proteins cannot diffuse into cells and 
cannot interact with DNA or chromosomal 
material (ICH S6).
Carcinogenicity
No standard carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted with talquetamab. Standard 
carcinogenicity studies are generally not 
applicable to therapies for advanced cancer 
indications (ICH S9).
Safety pharmacology: 
The tool molecule, JNJ-64024701, had no 
effects on cardiovascular endpoints in the 
1-month repeat-dose toxicity study in 
cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly IV 
doses up to 30 mg/kg.
Nervous system
The tool molecule, JNJ-64024701, had no 
effects on central nervous system endpoints
(clinical observations and body temperature) in 
the pivotal 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study 
in cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly 
IV doses up to 30 mg/kg.
Other toxicity-related information or data 
Cytokine Release: In vitro, talquetamab 
induced cytokine release in human blood of 
IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-, 
and TNF-
Local Tolerance: In a cynomolgus monkey 
exploratory 4-week IV tolerability study and 
an SC local tolerance study in rabbits (non-
cross-reactive species), there were no adverse 
effects noted at the injection sites.
Due to limited pharmacodynamic activity and lack of 
toxicity observed with the tool molecule in healthy 
animals, the lack of cardiovascular findings may not 
translate to patients with multiple myeloma. 
Hypotension and tachycardia have been reported in 
cynomolgus monkeys following treatment with other 
CD3 redirectors, which are possibly related to 
cytokine release (Saber 2017). 
Due to limited pharmacodynamic activity and lack of 
toxicity observed with the tool molecule in healthy 
animals, the lack of findings may not translate to 
patients with multiple myeloma.
The biological relevance of the in vitro cytokine 
release to human risk is unclear; however, CRS is a 
known risk for CD3 redirectors.
The formulation tested was comparable to the clinical 
formulation.

a Talquetamab does not meet the criteria for reproductive risk assessment in a nonclinical species. This is based 
on: 1) intended use in patients with advanced malignancies, and of generally older age; 2) restricted normal 
tissue expression, including low or no expression in human reproductive tissues; 3) consideration of the use of 
cynomolgus monkey as the only relevant nonclinical species; 4) minimal pharmacodynamic activity and absence 
of adverse effects in the toxicology studies, including reproductive organs and tissues; 5) development of anti-
drug antibodies that reduced exposure of talquetamab following a single dose and the tool molecule 
(JNJ-64024701) following repeated dosing; 6) the restricted access of immunoglobulin to the embryo during 
embryogenesis; and 7) the known maternal effects of CD3 redirection pharmacology, such as cytokine release or 
TLS, which may pose a potential risk to a pregnant mother and her unborn child.

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SIII:  Clinical Trial Exposure
SIII.1.
Brief Overview of Development
The safety of talquetamab (JNJ-64407564) in the multiple myeloma population is supported by 
one clinical trial in this EU RMP, ie, Trial 64407564MMY1001 (also known as MonumenTAL-1; 
hereafter  referred  to  as  MMY1001).  The  clinical  cutoff  date  for  safety  data  from  this  trial  is 
17 January 2023.
Trial MMY1001 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter trial of talquetamab administered 
as  monotherapy  to  adult  participants  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple  myeloma.  Phase  1 
included  dose  escalation  and  dose  expansion  and  evaluated  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and 
pharmacodynamics of talquetamab, as well as selection and preliminary evaluation of the proposed 
RP2Ds. Based on data from Phase 1, two RP2Ds were identified to be further evaluated in Phase 2: 
0.4 mg/kg weekly  (preceded  by  step-up  doses  of  0.01  and  0.06 mg/kg)  and  0.8 mg/kg Q2W 
(preceded by step-up doses of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.3 mg/kg), both administered SC. During Phase 2, 
the RP2Ds were evaluated in the following cohorts: 



Cohort A  (0.4 mg/kg  weekly  SC)  enrolled  participants  with  multiple  myeloma  who  had 
previously  received  ≥3  prior  therapies that  included  at  least  one  PI,  one  IMiD,  and  an 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and have not been exposed to T cell redirection therapies 
such as CAR-T or bispecific antibodies.
Cohort B  (0.4 mg/kg  weekly  SC)  enrolled  participants  with  multiple  myeloma  who  had 
previously  received  ≥3  prior  therapies that  included  at  least  one  PI,  one  IMiD,  and  an 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and had been exposed to T cell redirection therapies such as 
CAR-T or bispecific antibodies.
Cohort C  (0.8 mg/kg  Q2W SC)  enrolled  participants  with  multiple  myeloma  who  had 
previously  received  ≥3  prior  therapies that  included  at  least  one  PI,  one  IMiD,  and  an 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and had not been exposed to T cell redirection therapies such 
as CAR-T or bispecific antibodies. 
The RMP includes data from participants who received talquetamab SC at the RP2Ds, either in 
Phase 1 or Phase 2, including participants with or without prior T cell redirection therapy. As of 
the clinical cutoff date of 17 January 2023, this includes 339 participants (186 participants who 
received the 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose and 153 participants who received the 0.8 mg/kg Q2W dose).

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SIV:  Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials
SIV.1.
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Program
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 1
Pregnant or breast-feeding
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Pregnant women are normally excluded from clinical 
trials, particularly for indications in which pregnancy is 
uncommon. No reproductive toxicity studies have been 
conducted in the preclinical setting. 
Breast-feeding women are usually excluded from clinical 
trials. It is not known whether talquetamab is excreted in 
human milk.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding are uncommon in this 
heavily pretreated patient population, and thus use in these 
patients is not considered missing information. SmPC 
Section 4.6 states that talquetamab is not recommended 
for women who are pregnant or for women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. SmPC 
Sections 4.4 and 4.6 also state that females of 
reproductive potential should use effective contraception 
during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of 
talquetamab.
Criterion 2
Known to be seropositive for HIV or AIDS
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
HIV or AIDS from clinical trials of anticancer therapy 
because it potentially places patients with these 
comorbidities at increased risk for severe adverse events 
and also may confound the interpretation of safety. 
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Serious infections is considered an important identified 
risk. Based on the mechanism of action, there is no 
indication that the safety profile would differ in patients 
with well controlled HIV. The treating physician would be 
expected to weigh the benefit and risks for each individual 
patient.

Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1

Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 3
HBV infection or active HCV infection
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
active HBV or HCV infections from clinical trials on 
anticancer therapy because they potentially place patients 
with these comorbidities at increased risk for severe 
adverse events and also may confound the interpretation 
of safety.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Serious infections is considered an important identified
risk for talquetamab. Based on the mechanism of action, 
there is no indication that the safety profile would differ in 
patients with non-active HBV/HCV infection. The SmPC
includes guidance that patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during 
treatment with talquetamab and treated appropriately.
Criterion 4
The following cardiac conditions:
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
 New York Heart Association Class III or IV 
congestive heart failure
 Myocardial infarction or CABG ≤6 months prior 
to enrollment
 History of clinically significant ventricular 
arrhythmia or unexplained syncope, not believed 
to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration
 History of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
It is common clinical practice not to include patients with 
potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions in trials on 
anticancer therapy because it may potentially place 
patients with these comorbidities at increased risk for 
adverse events, and it may confound the interpretation of 
safety data.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
The tool molecule, JNJ-64024701, had no effects on 
cardiovascular endpoints in the 1-month cynomolgus 
monkey toxicological study. No safety signal has been 
observed for cardiovascular disease in the clinical trial 
with the exception of hypotension in the context of CRS. 
Cardiovascular toxicity is not expected following 
talquetamab therapy. The treating physician would be 
expected to weigh the benefit and risks for each individual 
patient. 
21
Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1
17 November 2023
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Criterion 5
Any serious underlying medical condition, such as:
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
 Evidence of serious active viral, bacterial, or 
uncontrolled systemic fungal infection
 Active autoimmune disease or a documented 
history of autoimmune disease, with the exception 
of vitiligo, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, 
and prior Grave’s disease that is currently 
euthyroid based on clinical symptoms and 
laboratory testing
 Psychiatric conditions (eg, alcohol or drug abuse), 
severe dementia, or altered mental status

Stroke or seizure within 6 months of signing the 
informed consent form
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
uncontrolled infections from clinical trials on anticancer 
therapy because it potentially places patients with these 
comorbidities at increased risk for severe adverse events, 
and it may confound the interpretation of safety data. 
Also, infection may complicate the course and 
management of CRS.
It is common clinical practice not to include patients with 
autoimmune diseases in oncology clinical trials because it 
may potentially place patients at increased risk for 
immune-related side effects and may confound the 
interpretation of safety data. In addition, patients with 
autoimmune disorders commonly require immune 
suppression which is not permitted in clinical trials as it 
could impact the efficacy of talquetamab.
Neurologic toxicities have been reported with bispecific 
T cell redirection therapy. Therefore, inclusion of patients 
with altered mental status or previous stroke or seizure 
may confound analysis of neurologic toxicity and may 
increase risk to patients with these types of underlying 
conditions.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
22
Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1
17 November 2023
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
The SmPC includes a recommendation to withhold
talquetamab in the case of infection.
There are no specific data on the use of talquetamab in 
patients with autoimmune disease, psychiatric conditions,
or recent stroke or seizure. There is no expectation that the 
safety profile would substantially differ in these patient 
populations. The treating physician would be expected to 
weigh the benefit and risks for each individual patient. 
Immune-related events including autoimmune disease will 
continue to be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance activities in the postmarketing setting.
Criterion 6
CNS involvement or clinical signs of meningeal 
involvement of multiple myeloma
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Neurologic toxicities have been reported with bispecific 
T cell redirection therapy. Therefore, inclusion of patients 
with known CNS involvement may increase their risk of 
neurologic toxicities.
Considered to be included as missing
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 7
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Neurologic toxicity including ICANS is considered an 
important identified risk. The treating physician would be 
expected to weigh the benefit and risks for each individual 
patient.
Active malignancies (ie, progressing or requiring 
treatment change in the last 24 months) other than the 
multiple myeloma, with exceptions of non-muscle 
invasive bladder cancer, skin cancer, noninvasive 
cervical cancer, localized prostate cancer, certain 
forms of breast cancer, or malignancies considered 
cured with minimal risk of recurrence
It is common clinical practice to exclude patients with 
other active malignancies from clinical trials, in order to 
avoid overlapping toxicities from anticancer therapies.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No

Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1
17 November 2023
Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development Program
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Criterion 8
Reason for being an exclusion criterion
Overlapping malignancies are relatively rare. In case of 2 
or more co-existing malignancies, it is common practice 
to focus treatment on the one that needs the most urgent 
attention and to hold treatment for other malignancies as 
those might interfere with treatment of the 'primary' 
malignancy. Physicians would be expected to weigh the 
benefit and risk and prioritize cancer therapies based on 
the individual patient. There is no scientific rationale to 
expect that the safety profile would differ in patients with 
active malignancies.
Patients with cytopenia at screening, ie, platelets 
<50×109/L or ANC <1.0×109/L
Patients with decreased platelets may be at increased risk 
for bleeding. Patients with low hemoglobin may be at 
increased risk for organ complications such as myocardial 
infarction.
Considered to be included as missing 
information: Yes/No
No
Rationale (if not included as missing 
information)
Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are both considered to 
be known risks of talquetamab that require no further 
characterization and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance and for which the risk minimization 
messages in the product information are adhered by 
prescribers.
SIV.2.
Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programs
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as 
rare  adverse  reactions,  adverse  reactions  with  a  long  latency,  or  those  caused  by  prolonged  or 
cumulative exposure.

Risk-Benefit Impact
Cytokine release syndrome is a known class effect associated 
with T cell redirection therapy. While CRS may be life-
threatening or fatal, the majority of CRS events in the 
clinical trial were Grade 1 or 2. The risk of CRS was 
mitigated by the use of step-up dosing and pretreatment 
medicinal products. Detailed guidance for how to manage 
and mitigate this risk is provided in the SmPC and PL and 
reflects the guidance followed by investigators in the clinical 
trial. Follow-up data from Trial MMY1001 and results from
Trial 64407564MMY3002 (hereafter referred to as 
MMY3002) will provide further information on the risk of 
CRS. A Patient Card is included as an additional risk 
minimization measure to further mitigate the risk of CRS, by 
increasing patient awareness of signs and symptoms 
requiring medical attention. Overall, the risk-benefit balance 
is positive for the product considering the severity of the 
proposed indication, the demonstrated efficacy for patients 
treated with talquetamab, and the primarily low-grade 
severity of CRS observed in the clinical trial.
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class 
effect associated with T cell redirection therapy. While these 
events may be life threatening or fatal, the majority of events 
in the talquetamab clinical trial were Grade 1 or 2. Detailed 
guidance for how to manage and mitigate neurologic toxicity 
including ICANS is provided in the SmPC and PL. Follow-
up data from Trial MMY1001 and results from Trial 
MMY3002 will provide further information on this risk. 
Additional risk minimization measures to further mitigate the 
risk of neurologic toxicity including ICANS include a 
Patient Card and HCP Educational Materials. Overall, the 
risk-benefit balance is positive for the product considering 
the severity of the proposed indication, the demonstrated 
efficacy for patients treated with talquetamab, and the 
primarily low-grade severity of neurologic toxicity including 
ICANS observed in the clinical trial.
Serious infections including pneumonia and sepsis have been 
reported in the talquetamab clinical trial. Multiple myeloma 
is a bone marrow disorder of immune system cells (plasma 
cells) with impaired immune function, thus the incidence of 
serious infection in this refractory and relapsing population 
is expected to be high. Follow-up data from Trial MMY1001 
and results from Trial MMY3002 will provide further 
information on the risk of serious infections. The SmPC and

Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks

Important Identified Risk: Cytokine release syndrome
Potential Mechanisms:
Cytokine  release  syndrome  is  a  consequence  of  the  pharmacological  effect  associated  with 
bispecific T cell redirection therapy. The specific mode of action of talquetamab is based on the 
binding and activation of T cells and the release of cytokines in the tumor environment; therefore, 
adverse events of CRS are anticipated.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cytokine  release  syndrome  is  a  known  class  effect  associated  with  T cell  redirection therapy. 
Cytokine release syndrome has been reported in participants treated in the talquetamab clinical 
trial and was identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for CRS and information regarding this 
adverse reaction are described in the SmPC for talquetamab. 
Based on the strength of evidence from the clinical trial data and information from the literature, 
CRS is considered an important identified risk for talquetamab.

Clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  CRS  may  include  but  are  not  limited  to  pyrexia, hypotension, 
chills,  hypoxia,  headache,  tachycardia,  and  elevated  transaminases.  Potentially  life-threatening 
complications  of  CRS  may  include  cardiac  dysfunction,  acute respiratory  distress  syndrome, 
neurologic toxicity, renal or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
At  the  RP2Ds  in  Trial  MMY1001,  CRS  was  reported  for  76.7% of  participants.  For  most 
participants with CRS (98.1%), the severity was Grade 1 or 2; 1.9% of participants had Grade 3 
events  and  there  were  no  Grade  4  or  5  events.  Most  events  occurred  during  the step-up  phase 
following the 0.01 mg/kg dose (28.9%), the 0.06 mg/kg dose (44.2%), the 0.3 mg/kg dose (for 
participants who received biweekly [every 2 weeks] dosing; 33.3%), or the initial treatment dose 
(0.4 mg/kg [29.6%] or 0.8 mg/kg [12.4%]). Less than 4% of CRS events occurred from Week 5 
onward; all events were Grade 1. Most events of CRS (92.3%) occurred within 48 hours of the last 
talquetamab dose; the median time to onset was 27 hours (range: 0.1 to 333 hours [1 to 14 days]). 
33
Talquetamab
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1

The median duration of CRS was 17 hours, ranging from 0 to 622 hours (1 to 26 days). As of the 
clinical  cutoff  date,  99.6% of  participants  with  CRS  had  recovered;  CRS  was  unresolved  for 
1 participant.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
The risk factors of CRS are not fully identified; however, active infection may increase the severity 
of CRS. Active infection was an exclusionary criterion in clinical trials.
Preventability:
Specific guidance in the SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4 is provided to minimize and manage the risk 
of CRS.  To  reduce  the risk  of CRS,  talquetamab should  be initiated using  step-up  dosing,  and 
pretreatment medicinal products should be administered during the step-up phase. As the majority 
of CRS events occur within the first 48 hours after dosing, patients should be instructed to remain 
within the proximity of a healthcare facility and be monitored for 48 hours after administration of 
all  doses  within  the  step-up  phase.  At  the  first  sign  of  CRS,  patients  should  be  evaluated  for 
hospitalization, and treatment should be started. For patients who experience CRS, pretreatment 
medicinal products should be administered before their next dose. Part V.2 of the RMP includes 
an additional risk minimization measure (ie, Patient Card) to further mitigate the risk of CRS.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Cytokine  release  syndrome  is  a  known  class  effect  associated  with  T  cell  redirection therapy. 
While CRS may be life-threatening or fatal, the majority of CRS events in the clinical trial were 
Grade 1 or Grade 2. The risk of CRS was mitigated by the use of step-up dosing and pretreatment 
medicinal products. Detailed guidance for how to manage and mitigate this risk is provided in the 
SmPC and PL and reflects the guidance followed by investigators in the clinical trial. A Patient 
Card is included as an additional risk minimization measure to further mitigate the risk of CRS, 
by increasing patient awareness of signs and symptoms requiring medical attention. Overall, the 
risk-benefit balance is positive for the product considering the severity of the proposed indication, 
the  demonstrated  efficacy  for  patients  treated  with  talquetamab,  and  the  primarily  low-grade 
severity of CRS observed in the clinical trial.
Public Health Impact:
All  usage  will  be  well  controlled  by  the  healthcare  professional.  No  public  health  impact  is 
anticipated.

Important Identified Risk: Neurologic toxicity including ICANS
Potential Mechanisms:
Neurologic toxicity, particularly ICANS, has been reported with other T cell redirection therapies; 
however, the precise mechanism is unclear.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class effect associated with bispecific T cell 
redirection therapy. Neurologic toxicity has been reported in participants treated with talquetamab 
in the clinical trial and several neurologic events were identified as adverse reactions. The risk for 
neurologic toxicity including ICANS is described in the SmPC for talquetamab. 
Based  on  the  known  class  effect  and  the  evidence  from  clinical  trial  data,  neurologic  toxicity 
including ICANS is considered an important identified risk for talquetamab.
Characterization of the Risk:
Clinical  manifestations  of  neurologic  toxicity  varied  from  Nervous  System  Disorders  to 
Psychiatric Disorders. Thus, TEAEs included in this important identified risk were those in the 
System Organ Classes (SOCs) of Nervous System Disorders or Psychiatric Disorders (excluding 
preferred terms of dysgeusia, ageusia, hypogeusia, and taste disorder) that were considered by the 
investigator to be related to talquetamab. However, the major safety concern for talquetamab is 
ICANS as a class effect associated with bispecific T cell redirection therapies.
Investigators  graded  events  of  ICANS  prospectively  according  to  ASTCT  criteria  (Lee  2019). 
Because  Phase  1  started  before  the  ASTCT  criteria  were  implemented,  ICANS  could  not  be 
identified or excluded  prospectively  for  participants in Phase 1. Therefore,  ICANS  data in this 
section are presented for Phase 2 only.

At the RP2Ds in Trial MMY1001, neurologic toxicity including ICANS was reported for 28.9% 
of participants as of the clinical cutoff date. The maximum severity of events was Grade 1 or 2 for 
90.8% of participants and Grade 3 or 4 for 9.2% of participants. As of the clinical cutoff date,

(68.0%)  occurred  within  48 hours  of  the  last  talquetamab  dose;  the  median  time  to  onset  was 
28 hours (range: 3 to 355 hours [1 to 15 days]). The median duration of ICANS events was 9 hours
(range: 2 to 194 hours [1 to 8 days]). As of the clinical cutoff date, 84.6% of participants with 
ICANS had recovered or were recovering and 15.4% of participants had not yet recovered.

Risk Management Plan Version 2.1
17 November 2023
Although  not in  scope  for  the  RMP  analyses,  one  fatal  event  of  ICANS  was  reported  for a 
participant enrolled at an investigative site in China. The event occurred within 30 days of the last 
dose of talquetamab and was considered related to talquetamab treatment.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk factors have not been fully identified. Patients with CNS disorders may be at higher risk for 
neurological adverse events.
Preventability:
As the majority of  ICANS events occur within the first 2 days after dosing, patients should be 
instructed to remain within the proximity of a healthcare facility and be monitored for 48 hours 
after administration of all doses within the step-up phase. At the first sign of neurologic toxicity 
including  ICANS,  patients  should  be  evaluated  and treated  with  consideration  for  neurologic 
evaluation.  Talquetamab  should  be  withheld  until  resolution  of  any  Grade  1,  Grade  2,  or  first 
occurrence of a Grade 3 event of ICANS. Patients should be permanently discontinued for any 
recurrent Grade 3 or any Grade 4 ICANS event. In the case of any Grade 2 or higher ICANS event, 
patients should remain within the proximity of a healthcare facility and be monitored for 48 hours 
after administration of the next dose of talquetamab. Specific guidelines for the management of 
neurologic toxicity including  ICANS are provided in the SmPC. Part V.2 of the RMP includes 
additional risk  minimization measures (ie, Patient Card, HCP  Educational Materials)  to further 
mitigate the risk of neurologic toxicity including ICANS.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class effect associated with T cell redirection
therapy.  While  these  events  may  be  life  threatening  or  fatal,  the  majority  of events  in  the 
talquetamab clinical trial were Grade 1 or 2. Detailed guidance for how to manage and mitigate 
neurologic toxicity including ICANS is provided in the SmPC and PL. Follow-up data from Trial 
MMY1001  and  results  from  Trial MMY3002  will  provide  further  information  on  this  risk. 
Additional risk minimization measures to further mitigate the risk of neurologic toxicity including 
ICANS include a Patient Card and HCP Educational Materials. Overall, the risk-benefit balance 
is positive for the product considering the severity of the proposed indication, the demonstrated 
efficacy for patients treated with talquetamab, and the primarily low-grade severity of neurologic 
toxicity including ICANS observed in the clinical trial.
Public Health Impact:
All  usage  will  be  well  controlled  by  the  healthcare  professional.  No  public  health  impact  is 
anticipated.

Important Identified Risk: Serious infections
Potential Mechanisms:
Risk Management Plan Version 2.1
17 November 2023
Patients  with  multiple  myeloma  are  susceptible  to  infection  due  to  underlying  disease causing 
hypogammaglobulinemia  and  immunosuppression  (Terpos  2015).  GPRC5D  is  expressed  on 
normal plasma  cells in  addition  to multiple myeloma cells. Thus,  normal  plasma cells are  also 
expected to be targeted by talquetamab, which may cause hypogammaglobulinemia and infection.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have 
been reported for participants treated with talquetamab in the clinical trial and serious infections 
such as pneumonia and sepsis have been identified as adverse reactions. Based on this, serious 
infections  are  considered  an  important  identified  risk  for  talquetamab.  The  risk  for  serious 
infection  and  information  regarding  this  adverse  reaction  are  described  in  the  SmPC  for 
talquetamab. 
Characterization of the Risk:
Note: Although the important identified risk is serious infections, all adverse events identified by 
the SOC of infections and infestations are captured in the following table, independent of their

At the RP2Ds in Trial MMY1001, infections were reported for 64.0% of participants and were 
considered serious for 17.7% of participants. The severity was Grade 5 for 2.3% of participants, 
Grade 4 for 3.2% of participants, and Grade 3 for 25.8% of participants. The 5 fatal events were 
COVID-19 pneumonia (2 participants), and septic shock, fungal sepsis, and infection (unknown 
etiology) (1 participant each). None of the fatal events were considered related to study drug. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
There are multiple factors that may increase the  risk of  infectious  complications. Patients with 
multiple  myeloma  are  at  risk  of  infection  due  to  the  overproduction  of  ineffective  monoclonal 
antibodies  from  the  underlying  disease,  which  causes  immune  dysfunction.  Multiple  myeloma 
patients  have  as  much  as  a  15-fold  increase  in  risk  of  infections,  particularly  pneumonia.  In 
addition, the functional status and medical fragility of the patient may be a risk factor. Studies have 
shown that hospitalized patients, those with poor functional status or comorbid conditions, and 
older  adults  are  more  likely  to  develop  infection  complications.  Another  risk  factor  is  the 
39

concomitant use of other immunosuppressive medications with synergistic adverse immunologic 
treatments  (eg, 
effects.  The  use  of  multiple  chemotherapy  and 
corticosteroids),  and  neutropenia  as  a  complication  of  the  treatments,  increases  the  risk  of 
infection. 
immunosuppressive 
Preventability:
Talquetamab should be withheld during the step-up phase until the infection resolves, and should 
be  withheld  during  the  treatment  phase  until  the  infection  improves  to  Grade  2  or  better. 
Talquetamab should not be administered in patients with active serious infection. Prior to starting 
talquetamab, prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of infections (including antiviral 
prophylaxis for prevention of herpes zoster virus reactivation), per local institutional guidelines. 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment 
with  talquetamab  and  should  be  treated  appropriately.  Prophylactic  antimicrobials  should  be 
administered according to local institutional guidelines.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
Serious infections including pneumonia and sepsis have been reported in the talquetamab clinical 
trial. Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow disorder of immune system cells (plasma cells) with 
impaired immune function, thus the incidence of serious infection in this refractory and relapsing 
population is expected to be high. Follow-up data from Trial MMY1001 and results from Trial 
MMY3002 will provide further information on the risk of serious infections. The SmPC and PL 
provide  information  on  how  to  manage  the  risk  of  serious  infection.  Overall,  the  risk  benefit 
balance  is  positive  for  the  product  considering  the  severity  of  the  proposed  indication  and  the 
demonstrated efficacy for patients treated with talquetamab.
Public Health Impact:
All  usage  will  be  well  controlled  by  the  healthcare  professional.  No  public  health  impact  is 
anticipated.

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for talquetamab
This is a summary of the RMP for talquetamab. The RMP details important risks of talquetamab, 
how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about talquetamab’s 
risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Talquetamab’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how talquetamab should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for talquetamab should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the EPAR.
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of talquetamab's 
RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
Talquetamab is authorized as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and
refractory  multiple  myeloma,  who  have  received  at  least  3  prior  therapies,  including  an 
immunomodulatory  agent,  a proteasome  inhibitor,  and  an  anti-CD38  antibody and  have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
talquetamab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.
Further information about the evaluation of talquetamab’s benefits can be found in talquetamab’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage.

Important risks of talquetamab, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about talquetamab's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (eg, with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.

In the case of talquetamab, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of talquetamab is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of talquetamab are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of talquetamab. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of Important Risks
Important Identified Risk:  Cytokine release syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Cytokine release syndrome is a known class effect associated with 
T cell redirection therapy. Cytokine release syndrome has been 
reported in participants treated in the talquetamab clinical trial and 
was identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for CRS and 
information regarding this adverse reaction are described in the 
SmPC for talquetamab. 
Based on the strength of evidence from the clinical trial data and 
information from the literature, CRS is considered an important 
identified risk for talquetamab.
The risk factors of CRS are not fully identified; however, active 
infection may increase the severity of CRS. Active infection was 
an exclusionary criterion in clinical trials.

Important Identified Risk:  Neurologic toxicity including ICANS
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Neurologic toxicity, primarily ICANS, is a known class effect 
associated with bispecific T cell redirection therapy. Neurologic 
toxicity has been reported in participants treated with talquetamab 
in the clinical trial and several neurologic events were identified as 
adverse reactions. The risk for neurologic toxicity including 
ICANS is described in the SmPC for talquetamab.

Important Identified Risk:  Serious Infections
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, including life-
threatening or fatal infections, have been reported for participants 
treated with talquetamab in the clinical trial and serious infections 
such as pneumonia and sepsis have been identified as adverse 
reactions. Based on this, serious infections are considered an 
important identified risk for talquetamab. The risk for serious 
infection and information regarding this adverse reaction are 
described in the SmPC for talquetamab.
There are multiple factors that may increase the risk of infectious 
complications. Patients with multiple myeloma are at risk of 
infection due to the overproduction of ineffective monoclonal 
antibodies from the underlying disease, which causes immune 
dysfunction. Multiple myeloma patients have as much as a 15-fold 
increase in risk of infections, particularly pneumonia. In addition, 
the functional status and medical fragility of the patient may be a 
risk factor. Studies have shown that hospitalized patients, those 
with poor functional status or comorbid conditions, and older 
adults are more likely to develop infection complications. Another 
risk factor is the concomitant use of other immunosuppressive 
medications with synergistic adverse immunologic effects. The use 
of multiple chemotherapy and immunosuppressive treatments (eg, 
corticosteroids), and neutropenia as a complication of the 
treatments, increases the risk of infection.

2. Scientific discussion 
2.1. Introduction 
Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterised by psychosis, mood disorders, and cognitive 
disorders. The clinical signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are very complex and display different 
patterns which vary widely from patient to patient. The symptoms are commonly divided into several 
broad clusters.  
• 
• 
• 
The positive symptoms represent an addition to normal behaviour that may involve hallucinations 
(perceptual experiences not shared by others), delusions (e.g., that others can interfere with one’s 
thoughts), thought disorder, bizarre behaviour and disorganised speech, movement disorders 
(repetition of certain motions over and over), and catatonia (no movement or no response to others).  
The negative symptoms comprise elements that are absent from normal behaviour, including 
anhedonia (loss of the ability to experience pleasure), asociality (withdrawal from social contacts), 
lack of volition, lack of motivation, flat or blunted affect or emotion, and alogia (reduced quantity or 
content of speech).  
Patients with schizophrenia may also suffer from cognitive impairments such as diminished attention, 
memory, and executive function (e.g., the ability to plan, initiate, and regulate goal-directed 
behaviours).  
•  Behavioural and affective deficits including depression, lethargy, mood swings, and inappropriate and 
odd presentation are frequently associated with schizophrenia, causing avoidance on the part of 
others and thereby leading to social isolation.  
The prevalence of schizophrenia (ie, the number of cases in a population at any one time point) 
approaches 1 percent internationally. The incidence (the number of new cases annually) is about 1.5 per 
10,000 people. 
As summarised in Meyer-Lindenberg (2002), while the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains unclear, 
several neurotransmitter systems have been suggested to be implicated, including dopamine, serotonin, 
gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and acetylcholine. Of these, the dopamine system has received 
the most attention (Meyer-Lindenberg, Miletich et al. 2002). The importance of dopaminergic 
mechanisms in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia was inferred from the link between the antipsychotic 
efficacy of neuroleptic drugs and their affinity for the dopaminergic D2 receptor. Frontal cortex 
dysfunction in this disorder has been postulated for even longer, since the modern conceptualisation of 
schizophrenia. Neuroimaging and basic research provide ample evidence for abnormalities in both of 
these domains in schizophrenia (Keks and Culhane 1999). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 8/100 
 
 
 
 
 
Antipsychotic drugs are commonly divided into typical (first generation) and atypical (second generation) 
categories. Seeman (2002) states that clinically effective doses of typical antipsychotic drugs generate a 
striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy of about 60% to 80%, approaching a level that is associated with 
a high risk of extrapyramidal side effects (Seeman 2002). Typical antipsychotic drugs are mostly effective 
against positive symptoms, but have a more limited effect on and may even exacerbate negative and 
cognitive symptoms (Keks and Culhane 1999). In contrast, atypical antipsychotics have lower affinity for 
and occupancy of the dopaminergic receptors and a high degree of occupancy for the 5HT2A serotonin 
receptors. Compared to typical antipsychotics, atypicals induce fewer extrapyramidal side effects at 
clinically effective doses, and may have greater efficacy in reducing negative symptoms (Keks and 
Culhane 1999). According to Dazzan (2005) and Lieberman (2005), as a group atypicals also have a 
greater ability than typical antipsychotic drugs to treat mood symptoms in patients with either 
schizophrenia or affective disorders (Dazzan, Morgan et al. 2005, Lieberman, Stroup et al. 2005).  
In 1984, based on the assumption that 5HT2A antagonism might improve efficacy of D2 blockers 
(particularly for negative symptoms) and reduce extrapyramidal side effects, Janssen Pharmaceutical 
developed the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, which combines potent 5HT2A and D2 blockades 
(Janssen, Niemegeers et al. 1988). Risperidone was launched in 1993 and rapidly incorporated into 
clinical practice, and is currently widely recommended as a first line option for treatment of psychosis 
(Keks and Culhane 1999).  
Risperidone 
Clinical experience has supported the efficacy and tolerability of both oral and long acting risperidone in 
several reviews (Grant and Fitton 1994, Rattehalli, Zhao et al. 2016, Sampson, Hosalli et al. 2016). The 
drug was first approved in Europe in 1993. 
Risperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative and a second-generation antipsychotic agent which combines 
potent serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonism (Grant and Fitton 
1994). As with other oral antipsychotic drugs, a challenge associated with risperidone is that many 
patients with schizophrenia are poorly compliant with their medications. In the Clinical Antipsychotic 
Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study, 74% of patients were found to have discontinued their 
prescribed drug within 18 months, many due to either poor tolerability or lack of efficacy (Swartz, Stroup 
et al. 2008). Even among those who do not explicitly discontinue drug therapy, non-adherence to 
long-term oral medication regimes is one of the most significant therapeutic issues in the therapy of 
schizophrenia and related disorders. As a result, many patients do not experience the full benefit of 
antipsychotic drug therapy, and suffer frequent relapses or exacerbations, which require 
re-hospitalisation. Missing as few as 1 to 10 days of oral antipsychotic therapy nearly doubles the risk of 
hospitalisation (Keks and Culhane 1999, Byerly, Nakonezny et al. 2007). The use of depot antipsychotics 
as a maintenance treatment for individuals with a history of non-adherence with oral antipsychotics is well 
recognised.  
The first depot second-generation antipsychotic drug on the market was Risperdal Consta, a long acting 
injection (LAI) risperidone formulation (Gaebel, Schreiner et al. 2010). Risperdal Consta is an IM 
risperidone microspheres formulation that is intended to deliver therapeutic levels of risperidone for 2 
weeks. However, due to the inherent lag phase of most microsphere products, it takes approximately 3 
weeks for sufficient amounts of risperidone to be released into systemic circulation; thus, patients must 
supplement the first 21 days post-injection with daily doses of oral risperidone.  
Okedi is an LAI containing risperidone in situ microparticles (ISM) (Risperidone ISM). The application is a 
hybrid application where the reference product is oral risperidone. The proposed dosage is 75 mg or 100 
mg monthly after titration with oral risperidone.

Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of risperidone is 
3-{2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl]ethyl]-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[1
,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one corresponding to the molecular formula C23H27FN4O2. It has a molecular mass of 
410.68 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 10/100 
 
 
 
 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of IR spectroscopy, 1H 
NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The solid-state properties of the active substance 
were investigated by XRD. 
The active substance is a white or almost white non-hygroscopic powder. It is practically insoluble in 
water, sparingly soluble in alcohol and freely soluble in dichloromethane, dissolves in dilute acid solutions. 
Risperidone has a non-chiral molecular structure. 
Polymorphism has been observed for risperidone. Literature describes the existence of three polymorphic 
forms: A, B and E. The selected polymorph was supplied and characterised by the sterile risperidone 
manufacturer. A study regarding polymorphism by X-ray diffraction on reference material and sterile 
risperidone from manufacturer (validation batches) was performed and indicates that the active 
substance manufacturer consistently manufactures the selected polymorph, which is controlled in the 
active substance release and shelf life specifications. It was also demonstrated that there is no polymorph 
change in the finished product at release or after storage under long term conditions for 36 months. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
As there is a monograph of risperidone in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for the 
active substance which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. Sterile 
risperidone is manufactured from Ph. Eur. grade risperidone, with a Certificate of Suitability. The 
information relevant to risperidone has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of 
Suitability. Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the sterile active substance has been 
provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
A single source of active substance has been used for manufacture of clinical batches and that 
manufacturer is the proposed commercial manufacturer. 
Sterile risperidone is obtained by crystallisation, then sterilisation of crude risperidone. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate product and reagents have been presented. The process is carried out in a class A closed 
system to ensure sterility. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in aluminium bins, which complies with the EU requirements. 
Specification 
Sterile risperidone is tested according to the Ph. Eur. monograph for risperidone with the addition of tests 
for residual solvents, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and particle size distribution. The active substance 
specification includes tests for: appearance, appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), identity and polymorphism 
(IR, X-ray), assay (potentiometry per Ph. Eur.), related compounds (LC per Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. 
Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Neither class 1 nor class 2 solvent is used. The limit of residual amounts of organic solvents complies with 
the ICH Q3C. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 11/100 
 
 
 
Control for microbiological purity were introduced to ensure minimal microbiological contamination, 
taking into account the parenteral use and the sterile aspect. 
The acceptance criteria for particle size distribution are based on functionality requirements and 
determined by the intended use. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on two commercial scale batches of the active substance as tested by the finished 
product manufacturer are provided. Further batch analysis data from the active substance manufacturer 
are provided as well. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided on 12 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH), on 6 commercial scale batches for up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 
ºC / 65% RH) and on 10 commercial scale batches for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, polymorphism, assay, related compounds, loss on 
drying, particle size distribution (laser diffraction), sterility and bacterial endotoxins. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within their specification limits after 36 months under long term conditions, 12 
months under intermediate and after 6 months under accelerated conditions.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The results show that 
the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
One batch was exposed to stressed conditions: forced light, acid, alkaline, oxidant, and heating conditions 
were investigated. There is a slight degradation under dry heat and oxidative stress, but the active 
substance is stable under other stressed conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months with no special 
storage conditions in the proposed container.

The reference product is Risperdal 4 mg coated tablets (Janssen Cilag Ltd). Differences compared to the 
reference product are changes in therapeutic indication, pharmaceutical form, strength and route of 
administration. 
The application submitted is partly based on data from the original reference medicine, and partly on data 
from the applicant’s own non-clinical tests and clinical trials. 
The finished product is a risperidone microparticle formulation which form in situ, developed as a 
prolonged-release formulation intended for intramuscular injection for treatment of schizophrenia by 
maintaining the effect for 1 month (28 days) after one single injection. 
The formulation is administered after reconstitution as a risperidone suspension into the muscle tissue. 
When the formulation is exposed to body fluids or water, the solvent DMSO diffuses away from the 
polymer-drug mixture and water diffuses into the mixture. The polymer is hardened and thereby trapping 
or encapsulating the drug within the polymeric matrix which solidifies to form an implant. 
The formulation consists of a controlled release system. The release of the active substance follows the 
general rules for diffusion or dissolution from the polymeric matrix.  
The absorption process described by the pop PK model for the drug disposition in the PK section of this 
report comprises a complex absorption process that, in addition to the small fraction released 
immediately, describes and quantifies two first-order absorption processes, one combined zero-order and 
first order process, and a first-order elimination. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
Based on the clinical and pharmacokinetics characteristics of the known presentations of risperidone as 
well as the in vitro drug release and physiochemical characteristics of the reference product (Risperdal 
tablets) as well as the properties of the active substance, a QTPP was defined and justified. 
Based on the QTPP and the controlled release mechanism, quality attributes were identified which ensure 
the performance of the finished product.  
Since the finished product is packaged in two single use pre-filled syringes prior to reconstitution and 
administration, these components have been also evaluated to assess the quality attributes with potential 
impact on the finished product. 
Critical material attributes of the active substance risperidone are polymorphism and particle size 
distribution. 
DMSO is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. No 
incompatibilities between sterile risperidone and the excipients have been observed in the stability 
studies performed both during the development of product and the formal and supporting studies. 
Copolymer PLGA was selected as the excipient for the finished product formulation based on its properties 
and in vivo behaviour. Polymer degradation occurs via hydrolysis of the polymer within the body. This is 
a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer widely used for the development of sustained release 
formulations both for oral and systemic administration. As PLGA is critical to the release mechanism, its 
quality is controlled with specifications including tests such as appearance, identification (IR), bioburden 
(Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).  
The formulation has been developed in several stages and the progress is extensively described. In 
clinical phase 1 and phase 2 studies, batches of risperidone with different particle size distributions and

with different sterilisation methods were used. Comparative in vitro drug release was demonstrated for all 
batches used in clinical studies including batches representative for marketing. 
Drug release is a critical parameter for the reconstituted finished product and a dissolution test reflecting 
this property is included in the specification. A flow-through cell apparatus was selected for the 
development of a predictive and discriminatory dissolution method capable of detecting manufacturing 
differences and predicting the in vivo performance. 
Apparatus 4 was chosen as it mimics the physiological flow of interstitial fluid after intramuscular 
administration across the in situ formed finished product depot. The development was based on the 
compendial flow through cell method described in the Ph. Eur. as well as in the USP. 
A drug release test was developed with multiple time points to correlate with the three stages of the 
release mechanisms. The dissolution test is described and discriminatory power with regards to varying 
active substance particle size distribution has been demonstrated for the 28-day real time test method. 
An accelerated dissolution test was developed using a time scaling factor. Discriminatory power is also 
demonstrated for the accelerated release method with regards to meaningful variations for the most 
relevant critical material attributes. The formulation and manufacturing development have been 
evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product 
quality attributes and critical process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode 
effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may 
have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on prior 
knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The critical process 
parameters have been adequately identified. 
Formulation Design Space is proposed with established acceptable ranges of the starting materials used 
in the manufacture of risperidone powder as well as the manufacturing process tolerances of the 
components of the formulation (risperidone, PLGA and DMSO). The ranges were investigated in 
multi-variate experiments and statistic methodology was applied to interpret the results and identify 
ranges where the formulation inputs will ensure the quality of the finished product. 
The development of the reconstitution process is described. After removal of caps, the syringes can be 
joined together via a twist-locking mechanism in order to mix the contents. Data was provided 
demonstrating that mixing by 100 pushes of the syringe plunger provides a homogenous suspension. 
User errors have been evaluated by a comparability study demonstrating similar concentration and in 
vitro drug release using 50 pushes. The syringes are then disconnected by untwisting before attachment 
of a needle for intra-muscular administration. Clear instructions for healthcare professions, including 
diagrams, are given in the product information. 
The powder pre-filled syringes are manufactured using aseptic processing since terminal sterilisation was 
not feasible. The sterilisation method is sufficiently justified according to 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015. 
The pharmaceutical development of the solvent for reconstitution in pre-filled syringe is described with 
sufficient details. The solvent pre-filled syringes are manufactured by sterile filtration followed by aseptic 
filling. The sterilisation method has been discussed and due to the nature of the product presenting a low 
risk with regards to microbiological growth, the justification was considered sufficient. 
The finished product for the pivotal clinical trial was manufactured by aseptic filling using a 
semiautomated procedure at the proposed commercial site, which is the same filling line and site where 
batches used for validation of manufacturing process and formal stability studies were produced. There 
are no significative differences between the manufacturing process used to produce the powder prefilled 
Assessment report

syringes batches used in the pivotal clinical trial and the comparative bioavailability study and the 
manufacturing process proposed for commercialisation. 
The primary packaging is cyclic olefin polymer syringe with a nozzle cap and plunger stopper composed of 
chlorobutyl  rubber  covered  with  polytetrafluoroethylene.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. Functional performance and compatibility aspects which 
determine the suitability of the DDC related to its intended use have been presented and found acceptable. 
Suitability of the DDC is also supported by full shelf life stability studies under ICH long term, intermediate 
and accelerated conditions. 
Physical and chemical compatibility between the finished product and its container closure system has 
been  demonstrated  through  interactions  studies  and  during  simulated  transportation  studies.  The 
compatibility of the plastic material with the medicinal product has been demonstrated by performing 
extraction and interaction studies. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of risperidone powder in pre-filled syringes is carried out by semi-automatic 
aseptic  filling  of  the  two  components  the  excipient  PLGA  and  the  active  substance  risperidone,  under 
sterile conditions. The manufacturing process of 75 mg and 100 mg powder syringes is common for both 
presentations. The only difference consists in the filling weight of each component.  
For the solvent for reconstitution in pre-filled syringe, the manufacturing process includes sterile filtration 
of DMSO and aseptic filling into syringes. The manufacturing process is adequately described and defined 
in the submission.  
Process  validation  for  the  risperidone  powder  in  pre-filled  syringes  has  been  performed  on  four 
commercial scale batches (two of each product strength), including measuring relevant attributes such as 
content uniformity. This approach was accepted due to similarity of the manufacturing process between 
different  dosage  strengths.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Process  validation  for  the  solvent  for  reconstitution  in  pre-filled  syringe  has  been  performed  on  four 
batches (two per strength). Both manufacturing process steps have been considered critical, i.e. sterile 
filtration of DMSO and aseptic filling into syringes. The holding time from beginning of compounding to 
beginning of filtration and the holding time from beginning to end of the aseptic filling of DMSO solvent 
syringe  is  proposed  and  accepted  based  on  the  data  provided.  The  in-process  controls  presented  are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The release specifications for syringes containing powder include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance,  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  content  uniformity  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC), moisture content (KF), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and closure system 
integrity (vacuum decay leak testing). 
The release specifications for pre-filled syringes containing DMSO shown include appropriate tests: 
appearance, identification (IR, refractive index (both Ph. Eur.)), water (KF), related substances (USP), 
sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (in house), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 15/100 
 
 
 
Release and shelf-life specifications for the reconstituted finished product include tests such as 
appearance, drug release (Ph. Eur., UPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.) and assay (HPLC) and 
injectability (in house). 
Specifications for pre-filled syringes containing powder, for pre-filled syringes containing DMSO and for 
the reconstituted finished product have been set in line with ICH and Ph. Eur. Requirements, taking into 
account the CQAs of the product and clinical batches. The test parameters are relevant for the 
pharmaceutical form and administration and the acceptance criteria is sufficiently justified for all 
parameters. 
For the pre-filled syringes containing powder specifications for impurities have been set in line with 
guideline ICH Q3B(R2) for potential degradation products identified during the forced degradation study 
are considered acceptable.  
For the reconstituted finished product injectability determination test is included in line with ICH 
guideline. Both break force and glide force are appropriately controlled using the same limits at release 
and shelf-life. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. In addition, 3 batches of 
powder in syringes and 3 batches of DMSO in syringes covering both strengths were tested using a 
validated ICP-MS method and all elemental impurities were below 15% of their respective PDE. Based on 
the risk assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls 
in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed as requested by the CHMP in the form of Major Objection, considering all suspected and 
actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants 
on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure 
under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures 
are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four commercial scale batches (two of each product strength) 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of the powder pre-filled syringes (two batches of each 
product strength each made from two different batches of the active substance and excipient) stored for 
up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate 
conditions  (30ºC  /  65%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Additional 
supportive data on clinical batches performed using the same formulation, manufacturing process and 
Assessment report

container closure system as proposed for marketing the finished product were provided. These batches 
were stored at 25ºC ± 2ºC/ 60% RH ± 5% RH and 5ºC + 3ºC. 
Samples  of  risperidone  powder  for  prolonged-release  suspension  were  tested  for  stability  indicating 
parameters  such  as  appearance,  assay,  impurities,  bacterial  endotoxins  and  sterility.  Reconstituted 
finished product was tested for stability indicating parameters such as appearance, drug release, assay.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Stability results of the powder prefilled syringes 
stored under long term conditions and intermediate conditions did not show changes, but the appearance 
of the product stored under accelerated conditions. No significant changes were observed for other 
parameters. 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of the pre-filled syringes containing solvent (two 
batches of each product strength) stored for up to 24 months under long term (25ºC / 60% RH), for up 
to12 months under intermediate (30ºC / 65% RH) conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Solvent prefilled syringes 
were stored in two orientations: inverted (or horizontal) and upright (or vertical). The batches are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Additional supportive data on batches gathered during the development were provided. These 
batches were stored at 25ºC ± 2ºC/ 60% RH ± 5% RH and 5ºC + 3ºC. 
Samples of solvent containing pre-filled syringes were tested for appearance, water content, related 
compounds, sub-visible particles, sterility bacterial endotoxins and container closure integrity. The 
specifications and methods were the same as those used for release. 
The results show that the storage position of the DMSO solvent prefilled syringe (placed into an inverted 
or horizontal position and an upright or vertical) is not relevant for stability. No significant changes have 
been observed under any conditions.  
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  of  the  powder  filled  syringes  and  DMSO-filled  syringes  was 
exposed  to  light  both  within  and  outside  of  secondary  packaging,  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. According to the results, neither component 
of the finished product is photosensitive. 
An in-use stability study was performed to cover the recommended in-use shelf-life defined as 
“immediate administration” after reconstitution. Based on the provided data, it can be concluded that the 
holding time for the reconstituted product should not exceed 15 minutes due to loss of homogeneity, 
hence supporting the recommendation of “immediate administration.” 
A stress study was performed for the powder filled syringes to investigate the stability-indicating power of 
the analytical procedures for assay and related substances. Degradation information obtained from stress 
studies (products of acid and base hydrolysis, thermal degradation, photolysis, and oxidation) for the 
active substance in the finished product demonstrates the specificity of the assay and analytical 
procedures for degradants. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years when stored under 30ºC in the original 
package to protect from moisture as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The finished product is a risperidone microparticles formulation which form in situ, developed as a 
prolonged-release formulation intended for intramuscular injection for treatment of schizophrenia by 
maintaining the effect for 1 month (28 days) after one single injection. It has been demonstrated that the 
applied control strategy ensures the quality of the finished product, including the in vivo release 
properties. 
During the procedure a risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product has been performed as requested by CHMP. Based on the information provided, it is 
accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished 
product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. The Major Objection was 
therefore resolved. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3. Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1. Introduction 
The nonclinical development programme of Risperidone ISM relies on information from the Risperdal® 
tablets (Risperdal®-SmPC, 2019) as well as additional PK and toxicology studies conducted with 
Risperidone ISM by the applicant. The nonclinical programme was agreed by the CHMP in a Scientific 
Advice held on April 28 2016 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/270310/2016). 
The pivotal non-clinical studies were performed in accordance with GLP. 
2.3.2. Pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamics of risperidone is well-known and thoroughly described in the literature. In 
summary, risperidone exhibits a combined antagonism activity on both serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine 
D2 receptors with a high binding affinity. Functional dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor 
antagonism activity of risperidone has been proven in a variety of in vitro and in vivo in animal models 
including mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs. The pharmacological profile of risperidone includes interaction 
with histamine H1 and α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors but the compound is devoid of significant 
interaction with cholinergic and a variety of other types of receptors.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 18/100 
 
 
 
Hypotension and reflex tachycardia observed in dogs are considered to be predominantly consequences 
of vascular α1-adrenoceptor blockade and therefore, risperidone may enhance the effects of 
antihypertensives. 
Risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone both can block IKr in HERG-transfected cells and increased ventricular 
action potential duration (APD) in a variety of preparations including canine Purkinje fibres, guinea pig 
cardiac papillary muscle, rabbit Purkinje fibres and canine ventricular myocytes. These effects occurred 
generally at higher concentrations and the in vivo data did not demonstrate a significant risk of 
arrhythmogenicity for risperidone since no significant effect of risperidone on QT, in either anaesthetised 
guinea pig or awake dog were observed.  
No further pharmacology studies are required, and the applicant provides none. 
2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has not conducted specific nonclinical studies with Risperidone ISM to evaluate the 
distribution, metabolism, excretion or PK drugs interactions of risperidone after IM administration of the 
product and no such studies are required. Reference to published data is considered adequate and 
sufficient. 
The applicant has conducted numerous PK studies and has presented 4 single-dose PK studies in NZW 
rabbits and Beagle dogs to identify the lead candidate Risperidone ISM formulation for further evaluation 
in nonclinical studies and clinical trials.  
Because risperidone presents an extensive and predominant metabolism to 9-OH-risperidone, which 
exhibits equivalent pharmacological activity as the parent compound, the PK evaluation of the product 
was based on active moiety (defined as risperidone plus 9-OH-risperidone) and not on individual 
risperidone or 9-OH-risperidone values. 
The bioanalytical methods used for the characterisation of the nonclinical PK and toxicokinetic profile of 
the Risperidone ISM involved gradient elution reversed-phased high-performance liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). 
All validations were performed in accordance with the criteria laid down in the FDA guidance “Bioanalytical 
Method Validation, 2001”. Afterwards this guidance was updated in 2018 (FDA Center for Drug Evaluation 
and Research (CDER), 2018) and the EMA published the Guideline for Bioanalytical Method Validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**, 2011), but the implemented changes do not affect the 
quality and acceptability of the results. Method validations were performed according to the principles of 
GLP. 
The PK profile of Risperidone ISM showed that the maximum concentration (Cmax) usually, with some 
exceptions and with a high variability, appears during the first 24 hours post-implantation followed by a 
gradual decrease to sustained levels until the end of the formulation effective period (around 28 days in 
rabbits and 28-35 days in dogs) for all studied compositions. Overall, the nonclinical PK of these studies 
was consistent with that known for risperidone. 
Risperidone is known to be rapidly distributed in different tissues including plasma, spleen, liver, kidney, 
lung, plasma and, in lesser extent, brain. The Vd after single dose of risperidone (2 mg/kg IV) was 
estimated at 0.32 L and 2.3 L for risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone, respectively. The protein binding of 
risperidone was found to average 88.2% in rat plasma and 91.7% in dog plasma. The protein binding of 
the metabolite 9-OH-risperidone was somehow lower, averaging 74.7% and 79.7% in rat and dog 
plasma, respectively. The percentage of risperidone distributed to blood cells in blood cell suspensions 
amounted 72% and 75% in rats and dogs, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 19/100 
 
 
 
The major metabolic pathways of risperidone in rats and dogs are the same as those in humans, namely: 
a) alicyclic hydroxylation, with resulting 9-OH-risperidone as the main metabolite, b) oxidative 
dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen, and c) benzisoxazole scission. In vivo and in vivo studies in rat 
liver microsomes revealed that CYP2D and CYP3A are the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of 
risperidone playing both a predominant role in 9-hydroxylation of risperidone. 
In rats, risperidone is mostly excreted in the faeces and in accordance to an extensive and rapid biliary 
excretion of metabolites; and with a limited enterohepatic circulation. In dogs, slower excretion than in 
rats was observed, and fractions excreted in the urine and faeces were similar. After a single oral dose a 
t1/2 of ca. 1.4 hours for risperidone and 21 hours for the 9-OH-risperidone was estimated in dogs whereas 
t1/2 of 0.82 hours for risperidone and 5.1 hours for the 9-OH-risperidone were calculated in rats after a 
single IV dose and, when administered orally in rats t1/2 reached values of 2.6 hours and 8.5 hours for 
risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone, respectively. A clearance of 0.27 L/h and 0.32 L/h for risperidone and 
9-OH-risperidone was estimated from rat studies. In animal studies, risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone 
are excreted in milk. 
2.3.4. Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicology programme supporting Risperidone ISM drug product is based on published 
data of studies evaluating risperidone and its active metabolite 9-OH-risperidone in mice, rats, and dogs 
via oral, intravenous (IV), and subcutaneous (SC) routes.  
In addition to the public available information, the applicant has conducted sub-chronic toxicity studies 
(2-cycle, 28 days (rabbit) and 31 days (dogs)/cycle) and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant 
chronic (12-cycle, 30 days (rabbits, dogs)/cycle) toxicity studies including toxicokinetic and local 
tolerance endpoints as well as an Ames Test study. These species were selected as rodents were 
considered too small for accurate dosing of the small injection volumes used with the ISM formulation. 
The findings such as somnolence, miosis, swelling mammary glands in females were mainly the result of 
prolactin-mediated effects or they were related to pharmacological effects of risperidone. No changes in 
the ECG were attributed to Risperidone ISM. The NOAELs obtained in these studies were the respective 
highest doses tested, of 76.7 mg/kg and 38.3 mg/kg Risperidone ISM (corresponding to 10 mg/kg and 5 
mg/kg of risperidone, respectively) for rabbits and dogs in the 2-cycle repeated studies, and of 115 mg/kg 
and 57.5 mg/kg Risperidone ISM (corresponding to 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg of risperidone, respectively) 
for rabbits and dogs in the 12-cycle chronic studies.  
Evaluation of local tolerance of Risperidone ISM revealed macro- and microscopically, muscular foreign 
body granulomatous inflammation with or without focal/multifocal multinucleated giant cells in the 
administration site of animals given Risperidone ISM. This effect was considered as a natural body 
response to the presence of a foreign substance. Reversibility of local effects at the injection site was 
demonstrated. Local tolerance and toxicity evaluation also included dose groups of DMSO-only at 70.0 
and 35.0 mg/kg. Transient pain following injection was observed in the dog and was attributed to DMSO. 
No systemic toxicity attributed to DMSO was observed. The approximated clinical dose of DMSO of 10 
mg/kg in the 100 mg dose of risperidone (bodyweight of 50 kg; dose of DMSO = 466.7 mg) is considered 
supported. 
The limits for impurities of the powder prefilled syringe are below the identification thresholds and the 
specifications of DMSO impurities complies with the DMSO monograph according to Ph. Eur. Further 
toxicological qualification of impurities is not required. 
The reverse mutation assay conducted by the applicant with Risperidone ISM, showed no mutagenic 
activity in Salmonella typhimurium and in Escherichia coli strains, with or without S9. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 20/100 
 
 
 
Published literature indicates no mutagenic potential of risperidone. In oral carcinogenicity studies of 
risperidone in rats and mice, increases in pituitary gland adenomas (mouse), endocrine pancreas 
adenomas (rat), and mammary gland adenomas (both species) were reported. This effect is thought to be 
related to prolonged hyperprolactinaemia resulting from dopamine D2 antagonism. The relevance for 
human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumours in rodents is unknown.  
No teratogenicity effects associated to risperidone administration was observed in rat or rabbit. In rat 
reproduction studies with risperidone, adverse effects were seen on mating behaviour, and on the birth 
weight and survival of the offspring. In rats, intrauterine exposure to risperidone was associated with 
cognitive deficits in adulthood similarly as observed with other antipsychotic drugs. Studies with 
risperidone in juvenile rats have shown a delay in physical development, with a reversible impairment of 
performance and memory. Dosing during lactation resulted in a reduced body weight of the high-dosed 
dams. 
2.3.5 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Risperidone is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in environmental 
exposure is anticipated. Since risperidone is not currently approved in Croatia an increased 
environmental exposure might be expected following an approval through the centralised procedure. 
However, since the tolerability of risperidone should be established with oral risperidone before initiating 
treatment in patients who have not been previously exposed to risperidone it is nevertheless agreed that 
there will be no increased exposure to the environment following approval of this risperidone formulation. 
Therefore risperidone is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Okedi manufactured by Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi, S.A. is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all risperidone containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The bioanalytical methods used for the characterisation of the nonclinical PK and toxicokinetic profile of 
the Risperidone ISM (risperidone + 9-OH-risperidone) involved gradient elution reversed-phased 
high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).  
The toxicological profile of risperidone is well characterised with the current knowledge on nonclinical 
toxicity published literature and with the clinical efficacy and safety data accumulated for decades of 
medical usage of the RMP Risperdal®.  
The studies conducted by the applicant support the safety of the risperidone LAI formulation, with no 
significant differences in toxicological findings between the pharmaceutical forms of the reference 
risperidone oral tablets and Risperidone ISM alternative LAI form. However, in the 2-cycle study in the 
rabbit, platelet values were increased in groups 2, 3, and 4 of females and were recognised by the 
applicant as not associated with the treatment. In the 12-cycle study in the dog dose levels were selected 
as equivalent dose for anticipated therapeutic plasma levels in humans during approximately 4 weeks. 
Therefore, the chosen doses are sufficient to produce pharmacodynamics or/and therapeutic effect. The 
observed local reactions following IM administration are considered acceptable. 
The wordings in the SmPC Section 5.3 is identical to the wordings for Risperdal, except for the order and 
the additional text that is unique for the IM LAI formulation.

2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections for approval of Risperidone ISM from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4. Clinical aspects 
2.4.1. Introduction 
The clinical development programme was designed considering the following regulatory guidances and 
advice. The development programme has been designed in accordance with the Guideline on the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96 
Corr1) 2014, the development guidance for schizophrenia (EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev.1;2012). The 
Scientific Advice discussions were (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/270310/2016) taken into account in terms of 
development for acute relapse and for long term safety. However, with regard to patients medically 
stabilised no specific studies were conducted with an active comparator as the applicant believes the 
hybrid submission will account for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients previously stabilised 
with antipsychotics on the basis of the population (pop) PK analyses.  
The clinical development of Risperidone ISM is composed of three Phase 1 studies (ROV-RISP-2009-01, 
ROV-RISP-2011-01 [PRISMA-1] and ROV-RISP-2020-02), four multiple dose studies, two comparative 
bioavailability study (ROV-RISP-2016-02 [BORIS, US reference product] and ROV-RISP-2020-01 
[BORIS-2, EU reference product]) in stable schizophrenia, one Phase 2 study (ROV-RISP-2011-02 
[PRISMA-2]) in stable schizophrenia and the Phase 3 study (ROVRISP-2016-01 [PRISMA-3]), ie the 
pivotal study, in acute relapse of schizophrenia, which also includes an open label extension (OLE) phase 
with rollover patients from the main phase as well as de novo stable patients.  
Two single-dose Phase 1 studies have been conducted to characterize the PK characteristics and to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of Risperidone ISM in healthy volunteers (n=17) ROV-RISP-2009-01) 
and in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n=36) ROV-RISP-2011-01 [PRISMA-1]), 
respectively. Doses evaluated (25 mg, 37.5 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) and the pop PK 
(11/ROV/081/1146a;2012) simulations to support them indicated that doses of Risperidone ISM 75 mg 
and 100 mg were the most appropriate for study in medically stable patients for maintenance and to 
evaluate both for the acute treatment of schizophrenia.

2.4.2. Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1. Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant intends to use pharmacokinetics for bridging to the marketed immediate release tablet. 
Bridging is pivotal as it is required for non-clinical data, pharmacokinetics in special populations, 
interactions, efficacy and safety. A similar total exposure (AUC) of active substance must be shown for

Risperidone ISM as for the German reference product. Data is generally presented for the active moiety, 
which is defined as risperidone plus 9-OH-risperidone.  
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
Three different LC-MS/MS methods have been validated for risperidone and its active metabolite 
9-OH-risperidone (also called paliperidone). No cross-validation was performed. Within study validation 
was within present acceptance criteria.   
Population PK analysis 
The aim of the analysis was to describe the population pharmacokinetics (Pop PK) of risperidone active 
moiety and to investigate relationships between clearance and several covariates (such as body size, age, 
race, sex).  
Pop PK models have previously been developed based on exposure data of risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone 
(equipotent active metabolite) or the active moiety from the single-dose studies, ROV-RISP-2009-01 and 
ROV-RISP-2011-01 (PRISMA-1), and the multiple-dose study, ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2), 
(11/ROV/081/1146a;2012, 11/ROV/081/1146a;2015, Snoeck, 2019). The final Pop PK model 
(18ROV0059) was developed building on the previous models describing the PK of the active moiety and 
included data from five clinical studies, ROVI-RISP-2009-01, ROV-RISP-2011-01 (PRISMA-1), 
ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2), ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3) and ROVRISP-2016-02 (BORIS). 
Simulations on different dosing schemes (switching between risperidone oral, LAI and Risperidone ISM, 
dose de-escalation, dose escalation, missed doses etc), including dose-dumping, were based on the final 
Pop PK model (SP1807266 (1381b) and SP1901640 (1146c)).  
Data 
The final pharmacokinetic dataset consisted of 447 subjects (25 mg (n=9 subjects); 37.5 mg (n=8 
subjects); 50 mg (n=10 subjects); 75 mg (n=213 subjects) and 100 mg (n=207 subjects)) with 6288 
active moiety concentrations.  
Results 
The final population PK model to describe active moiety PK after administration of Risperidone ISM, was 
a one-compartment disposition model with a complex absorption process, combining one small amount 
immediately dosed into the central compartment, two first-order absorption processes and one combined 
zero-order and first order process, and a first-order elimination from the central compartment. The final 
model parameter estimates are presented in Table 2.

Based on the stepwise covariate modelling, significant and clinical relevant (assuming a clinical relevance 
criterion of 15%) covariates were found to be BMI, formulation without milling (FORM) and sex on CL40. 
Other covariates included in the final model were galenic formulation on D3, injection site on FR and study 
Prisma-2 on FR, FR1 and FR2. The influence of covariates on the final pop PK model was summarised as 
follows:  
• CL40 decreased when BMI increased: a 10% change in BMI leads to around 3% change in CL40, 
with values of 5.27 and 4.17 L/h, for BMI values of 17.8 and 42.9 kg/m2, respectively. These BMI 
values being the extreme values in the current pop PK analysis. 
• CL40 increased by 16.6% in subjects who received the formulation without milling leading to lower 
exposure in studies ROV-RISP-2009-01 and PRISMA-1 after Risperidone ISM® administration. 
• CL40 decreased by 18.8% in female leading to higher exposure in female after Risperidone ISM® 
administration 
• D3 was significantly influenced by galenic formulation: indicating a 30% longer duration of the 
zero-order process for formulation without milling as compared to a formulation with milling  
• FR was significantly influenced by injection site: a higher fraction after injection in deltoid muscle 
of about 13% compared to injection in gluteus muscle 
• FR, FR1 and FR2 were significantly influenced by study PRISMA-2: higher after injection in patients 
from study PRISMA-2, about 54% increase compared to the 4 other studies 
The influence of covariates on descriptive PK parameters (Cmax, Ctrough, AUCtau) was assessed by 
simulating the active moiety PK profile following three injections of 75 mg of Risperidone ISM, once every 
28 days, using the final Pop PK model. Simulated profiles indicate the same Cmax and Ctrough for studies 
ROV-RISP-2009-01, PRISMA-1, PRISMA-3 and BORIS, while active moiety exposure (AUCtau) is 15% 
lower for ROV-RISP-2009-01 and PRISMA-1. Study PRISMA-2 had a slightly different absorption profile 
compare to the other studies, resulting in higher Cmax (around 27% higher), lower Ctrough (around 37% 
lower) but with similar exposure (AUCtau) as for PRISMA-3 and BORIS. 
Simulation different dosing schemes 
Different dosing schemes of Risperidone ISM were simulated and was compared to simulated profiles of 
oral risperidone and profiles for risperidone LAI (SP1807266 (1381b); SP1901640 (1146c)). Simulations 
were also performed for dose de-escalation, dose escalation, missed doses and dose-dumping.  
The Pop PK model of oral risperidone was obtained from the literature. Detailed Pop PK model parameters 
of risperidone LAI were lacking in the literature for which reason steady-state concentration-time profiles 
of active moiety were digitised from a publication (Samtani et al, 2011, CNS Drugs 25 (10): 829-845). 
Absorption 
Following IM injection, a small amount of the drug is released resulting in an initial peak in concentration 
after 24 to 48 hours. A second peak occurs between Days 18 and 25.  
Risperidone ISM can be administered in the gluteus or in the deltoid. Unbalanced PK sampling in the 
PRISMA-3 study results in minor differences in the PK profile between injection sites. No bioequivalence 
study was conducted to compare the early and the final formulation. The early formulations have a 
different release rate, with formulation being a significant covariate in the pop PK model. The studies with 
early formulations are therefore not further described. 
An in vivo relative bioavailability study with the purpose of bridging to the reference product was 
performed (BORIS study), initially using the US 4 mg Risperdal tablets and was repeated using the EU 
reference product (BORIS-2 study). The primary endpoint was the steady-state AUCtau for the active 
moiety, as the sum of the risperidone and 9-OH risperidone concentration. An adjusted AUC was

calculated for the oral sequence, in order to adjust for the dosing interval from 1 day to 28 days. The 
results of the statistical analysis are presented in Table 3.

Distribution 
Apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was determined in the population PK analysis: 248 L. 
Risperidone is bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein in human plasma. The plasma protein binding 
of risperidone is approximately 90% and is not concentration dependant up to 200 ng/mL. The protein 
binding of 9-OH-risperidone is 77%. The binding of risperidone increases at higher pH values. The blood 
to plasma concentration ratio of risperidone averages 0.67 in man. Displacement interactions of 
risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone with other drugs have been reported to be minimal. 
Risperidone was demonstrated to pass the placental barrier, and limited data show the presence of 
risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone in human breast milk. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life after administration of the final formulation was 556-624 h (PRISMA-3). After a 
single dose of 100 mg Risperidone ISM, the concentrations in the elimination phase decreased in a 
biphasic manner from Day 40 to Day 75, with a terminal half-life of 17 days (412h) and observed levels 
of risperidone active moiety generally <1 ng/mL on Day 75 (ROV-RISP-2020-02). Apparent clearance 
(CL/F) was determined in the population PK analysis: 4.67 L/h.  
Risperidone and its metabolites are eliminated via the urine and, to a much lesser extent, via the faeces. 
In a mass balance study of a single 1mg oral dose of 14C-risperidone, total recovery of radioactivity at 1 
week was 84%, including 70% in the urine and 14% in the faeces.  
Risperidone is metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 enzymes. The major metabolite is 
the active metabolite 9-OH-risperidone. It has a similar pharmacological activity to risperidone. The PK of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 29/100 
 
 
 
 
 
the active metabolite was studied as part of the active moiety. Another minor metabolic pathway is 
through N-dealkylation.  
CYPs 2D6, 3A4 and 3A5 were found to be responsible for metabolizing risperidone to 9-OH-risperidone, 
with activities of 7.5, 0.4 and 0.2 pmol-1CYP min-1, respectively in recombinant human CYPs. Both 
quinidine (inhibitor of CYP2D6) and ketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4) can inhibit the formation of 
9-OH-risperidone. Thus, both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are the main enzymes for the metabolism of 
risperidone to 9-OH-risperidone. 
Consequences of genetic polymorphisms 
Although CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers have lower risperidone and higher 9
OH-risperidone 
concentrations than poor metabolisers, the PK of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone combined (the active 
‑
moiety), after single and multiple doses, are similar in extensive and poor metabolisers.  
CYP2D6 phenotyping was performed in and classified according to a well-accepted activity score. An 
analysis of the AUC ratio vs CL in the pop PK model confirms that CYP2D6 has an insignificant impact on 
active moiety concentrations. 
The CYP3A5 genotype was demonstrated not to influence risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone, or active 
moiety. A significant effect of CYP2D6 genotype on the steady-state plasma levels of risperidone was 
observed and ABCB1 polymorphisms contributed to a certain extent to the interindividual variation in 
steady-state plasma levels of 9-OH-risperidone and active moiety. 
Dose proportionality 
The PK of the active moiety is dose proportional between 75 and 100 mg Risperidone ISM.  
Time dependency 
Minimal accumulation was seen in repeated dose studies. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the BORIS study, inter-subject variability for the steady-state concentration was 40% to 65% and 38% 
to 52% for US sourced oral risperidone and Risperidone ISM, respectively.  
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the inter-individual variability in CL40 and V4 were 33 
% and 34 %, respectively. The inter-individual variability in the absorption parameters, FR, FR1, K14, K24, 
D3, K34 were 20%, 36%, 17%, 109%, 15% and 25%, respectively. Inter-occasion variability on FR, FR1, 
FR2, K34 and FBA were 34%, 37%, 170%, 37% and 15 %, respectively. 
PK in target population 
PK parameters from the phase III study PRISMA-3 for risperidone, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety in 
the patients with intense PK sampling are summarised in Table 4. The mean Cavg and AUCtau values of 
risperidone for a dosing interval were higher for Risperidone ISM 100 mg as compared with ISM 75 mg. 
The same was true for 9-OH-risperidone and the active moiety.

ISM: in situ microparticles; Active moiety: risperidone + 9-OH-risperidone. (Note: parameters are named 
as per the source reports.) 1 Values are mean values except for tmax, where the median values are used, 
as noted in the parameter column. Source: Tables 41-43, ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3) CSR  
For the Risperidone ISM 75 mg dose, the mean risperidone active moiety estimated Cmax levels after the 
1st dose were 27.61 ng/mL; which after the 2nd and 3rd dose increased and generally stabilised to 38.95 
ng/mL and 37.16 ng/mL, respectively.  The mean Cmin values after 1st, 2nd and 3rd doses were mostly 
stable and in the range of 17.46 to 20.16 ng/mL.  
For the Risperidone ISM 100 mg dose, the mean risperidone active moiety estimated Cmax levels after 
the 1st dose were 32.00 ng/mL; which after the 2nd and 3rd dose increased and generally stabilised to 
53.44 ng/mL and 50.09 ng/mL, respectively. The mean Cmin values after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd doses were 
mostly stable and in the range of 26.14 to 27.23 ng/mL.  
The accumulation was minimal to moderate after multiple Risperidone ISM 75 mg and 100 mg doses and 
in the range of 1.11 to 1.27 for Cmin and 1.71 to 1.83 for estimated Cmax values. 
The plasma levels of risperidone are similar for both the injection sites for Risperidone ISM 75 mg, 
however, 9-OH risperidone plasma levels are marginally higher compared with risperidone for the gluteal 
injection site; thus, the active moiety also demonstrates a similar trend. The plasma levels of risperidone 
are similar for both the injection sites for Risperidone ISM 100 mg, however, unlike the 75 mg dose, 9-OH 
risperidone plasma levels are marginally higher compared with risperidone for the deltoid injection site; 
thus, the active moiety also demonstrates a similar trend (Figure 3). 
Overall for the active moiety, the dose-normalised AUCtau was slightly higher for injections given at the 
gluteal site compared with deltoid. In contrast, in the intense PK subset the dose normalised derived 
Cmax values were comparable for injections given at the gluteal site compared with deltoid. However, 
trough levels presented by dose-normalised Cmin values and peak levels presented by dose-normalised 
estimated Cmax values (Day 3) were similar for injections given by either gluteal or deltoid injection sites

in the PK population. The dose normalised Cmax or AUCtau was not found similar for both the gluteal and 
deltoid injection sites in an ANOVA analysis; the differences can be attributed to lower and unbalance ‘n’ 
for deltoid injection site, as well as Geo CV% up to 200%.  
According to the activity score for CYP2D6, the majority of patients were extensive metabolizers followed 
by intermediate metabolizers and least poor metabolizers. Overall, extensive metabolizers reported 
approximately 59% and 46% less estimated Cmax (dose 1) for risperidone as compared with poor and 
intermediate metabolizers, respectively. For separate comparison of deltoid and gluteal injection sites, 
extensive metabolizers reported at least 32% less estimated Cmax (dose 1) for risperidone as compared 
with poor and intermediate metabolizers. For 9-OH risperidone, extensive metabolizers reported 
approximately 3 times higher estimated Cmax as compared with poor metabolizers.

Switch  
Switching from oral QD 3 and 4 mg risperidone to q4w 75 and 100 mg Risperidone ISM, respectively was 
predicted to result in fairly similar exposures with a steady-state reached from the second injection 
onwards (Figure 4). The Cmax seemed higher after administration of Risperidone ISM as compared to oral 
risperidone at steady state. Relatively high peak concentrations were predicted not to occur immediately 
after switching to Risperidone ISM.

Switching from q4w 75 and 100 mg Risperidone ISM to oral QD 3 and 4 mg risperidone, respectively, 
showed that higher oral peak concentrations were observed for up to approximately 7 days following the

administration of Risperidone ISM as compared to oral risperidone.

Special populations 
There were no dedicated PK studies in elderly, children, patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. 
The applicant relies mainly on the information from the reference product. Risperidone ISM is not 
indicated in children. 
84 patients with mild renal impairment were included in the pop PK analysis, demonstrating no effect on 
exposure compared to patients with normal renal function.   
Effects of gender, race, weight and BMI on CL40 were studied in the pop PK analysis.  
For a fixed BMI of 28 kg/m2, active moiety exposure (AUCtau) increased by 23% in females compared to 
male, while Cmax increased by 19%. 
No effect of weight on CL40 were observed. For a male with a BMI of 17.8 kg/m2, active moiety exposure 
decreased by 11% compared to a male with a BMI of 28 kg/m2, while Cmax decreased by 9%. For a male 
with a BMI of 42.9 kg/m2, active moiety exposure increased by 12% compared to a male with a BMI of 28 
kg/m2, while Cmax increased by 10%. In an obese female (BMI of 32.1 kg/m2), active moiety exposure 
Assessment report

increased by 28% and could further increase in a morbid obese female (BMI of 42.9 kg/m2) to 38% as 
compared to a typical subject enrolled in the current analysis (male with BMI of 28 kg/m2). 
No effect of race on CL40 was observed. 
Interactions 
The interactions of Risperidone ISM with co-administration of other medicinal products have not been 
studied and thus rely on the reference product oral risperidone.  
Risperidone is mainly metabolised through CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent through CYP3A4. Both 
risperidone and its active metabolite 9-OH-risperidone are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Substances that modify CYP2D6 activity, or substances strongly inhibiting or inducing CYP3A4 and/or 
P-gp activity, may influence the PK of the risperidone active antipsychotic fraction. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The AUCtau,ss in stable schizophrenia patients at steady state was 325.3, 685.7 1083 day ng/mL for 
risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and the active moiety, respectively (BORIS study 100 mg IM). The 
corresponding Cmax,ss was 24.80, 41.88 and 64.85 ng/mL, respectively.  
Based on the final Pop PK model a worst-case scenario for dose dumping where the full dose entered the 
central compartment as a bolus were simulated. The simulated peak concentration of active moiety was 
about 300-400 ng/mL.  
2.4.2.2. Pharmacodynamics 
Exposure-efficacy 
The aim was to describe the dose-concentration-response relationship for Risperidone ISM in 
schizophrenic patients (19/ROV/0059 report). Data were obtained from the 12-week double-blind phase 
in the PRISMA-3 study. An exploratory analysis was performed on PANSS and CGI-S over time, as well as 
their association with the active moiety concentration. Logistic regression plots were generated for the 
dichotomous PANSS-response and overall-response variables. A dropout model was developed using a 
parametric hazard model.  
Data 
The final dataset used for modelling the PANSS data consisted of 383 patients (receiving placebo 
(n=131), 75 mg Risperidone ISM (n=127), 100 mg Risperidone ISM (n=125)) with 2403 PANSS 
measurements. Actual records of date and time of dosing were used. The individual concentrations of 
active moiety at the day of a PANSS and safety measurements (used in the exposure-safety analysis) and 
steady state concentrations were predicted based on the population pharmacokinetic model reported in 
18ROV0059.  
Results 
The dropout model described that the higher PANSS score, the more likely it was that a patient would 
dropout. Patients studied in USA had a significantly higher change of dropping out than Ukrainian patients 
(hazard ratio: 2.71 (95%CI: 1.81 – 4.06)). The model was only used in the PK/PD simulations. 
The exploratory analysis indicated similar response (change in PANSS score, PANSS score or Overall 
response rate) in dose groups 75 and 100 mg. PANSS change from baseline over time are shown in Figure 
7 whereas PANSS change from baseline versus active moiety concentrations are shown in Figure 8.

The proposed PK/PD model consisted of a placebo model, a drug-effect model and a time-dependent 
mechanism for the change in PANSS score over time. It was not possible to estimate the EC50. EC50 was 
therefore fixed to a value from literature (4.6 ng/mL) where the authors also analysed the concentration 
response relationship of a long-acting risperidone formulation by means of modelling. Parameters 
estimates for the final model are given in Table 5 and VPCs are shown in Figure 9.

Exposure-safety 
The aim was to perform exposure-safety analyses in order to identify and quantify a possible relationship 
between concentrations of active moiety and the occurrence of adverse events (19/ROV/0059 report). 
Data were obtained from the 12-week double-blind phase in the PRISMA-3 study.  
Exploratory graphical analysis was performed on the treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) data, 
extrapyramidal, hyperprolactinaemia, and somnolence/sedation events, evaluating their association with 
the active moiety exposure, followed by a logistic regression analysis. Longitudinal extrapyramidal 
symptoms as scored by SAS (Simpson Angus Scale), AIMS8 (Item 8 of the abnormal involuntary 
movement scale) and BARS4 (Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale Item 4) were analysed graphically in function 
of time and their associations with the active moiety exposure were evaluated.  
Handling of data 
All TEAE data recorded during the 12-week double-blind period were included in the logistic regression 
analyses. If a patient had more than one AE of a given type (i.e. same AE occurring repeatedly after the 
1st, 2nd and 3rd administration) only the first occurrence was included in the analysis.  
For the longitudinal exploratory exposure-safety analysis of the extrapyramidal symptoms as measured 
by SAS, AIMS8 and BARS4, an additional focus was on a time frame within 2 weeks after dosing instead 
of 1 week after dosing. 
The final dataset used for the exposure-safety analysis of the selected TEAE data was comprised of data 
from 437 subjects. For each selected TEAE, a subject was either scored as 0 (no TEAE) or 1 (TEAE).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022

437 subjects were included in the final dataset used for the exposure-safety analysis of longitudinal SAS, 
AIMS8 and BARS4 data. All three symptoms scores consisted of a total of 2683 scores: a total of 882 
scores after placebo in 147 subjects, 903 scores after 75 mg Risperidone ISM in 144 subjects and 898 
scores in 146 subjects after 100 mg Risperidone ISM.  
Analysis of the exposure-safety data 
The risk of extrapyramidal events was increased for Risperidone ISM versus placebo but no apparent 
relationship with active moiety exposure was present in the studied exposure range (Figure 10).

Measured SAS scores throughout the study appeared to be slightly higher for Risperidone ISM as 
compared to placebo. No relationship seemed to be present for the measured SAS scores at day 3 vs. the 
measured active moiety concentrations at day 2 (surrogate for Cmax). No apparent relationship was seen

2.4.2.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK Bridging 
Bridging by means of pharmacokinetics is considered pivotal as it is required for non-clinical data, 
pharmacokinetics in special populations, interactions, efficacy and safety. For a hybrid application of an 
intramuscular depot formulation with a reference product with a different route of administration and 
release rate, clinical data and pharmacokinetic studies are required showing a similar total exposure 
(AUC) of active substance as for the immediate release formulation, without requirement for 
bioequivalence. The new formulation should be characterised in appropriate single dose and multiple dose 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and clinical efficacy/safety studies. From a regulatory point of view, 
there is a need to establish an in vivo bridge against the EU reference medicinal product in the framework 
of article 10(3) applications (ie German Risperdal tablets). 
Risperidone has an active metabolite 9-OH-risperidone, or paliperidone, which is considered to have a 
similar pharmacological effect (reference product SmPC). It is therefore considered acceptable to study 
the sum of their exposures as the active moiety. 
In the context of bridging for clinical efficacy, different PK parameters may be relevant. The applicant 
considered several parameters for the bridging to the US reference product, namely AUC, Cmax, Cave, 
Cmin and peak to trough concentration (Fluctuation). This approach is agreed. According to the SmPC of 
oral risperidone, steady-state for risperidone is reached after 1 day and 4-5 days for 9-OH risperidone. 
The design of the relative bioavailability studies BORIS/BORIS-2 is therefore considered acceptable to 
reach steady state of both metabolite and parent. PK sampling was appropriate to characterise the 
respective steady state PK parameters. 
The applicant provided a new PK bridging study with the EU reference product (BORIS-2), which shows 
that the steady-state exposure of Risperidone ISM 100mg is slightly higher than for 4 mg oral risperidone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 44/100 
 
 
 
 
 
However, this increased exposure is within an acceptable range, as oral risperidone can be dosed up to 6 
mg. The PK bridge is thus considered established. 
The external validation performed by the applicant showed that the previously developed population 
pharmacokinetic models reasonably well described the observed active moiety concentrations in the 
BORIS-2 study, both after oral risperidone and Risperidone ISM injection. In addition, the Risperidone 
ISM model seemed to capture the terminal phase of the active moiety concentration-time profile in study 
ROV-RISP-2020-02. Thus, these results support that the previous popPK models are adequate, and no 
new simulations are needed.  
For acute therapy, the applicant was asked to provide PK data or simulations supporting a similar onset of 
efficacy as for oral risperidone. The active moiety exposure upon administration of 100 mg Risperidone 
ISM from 3h onwards (prior timepoints not discernible on the graph) is higher than the Ctrough of oral 
risperidone. Considering 65% receptor occupancy (RO) as the relevant threshold, it is achieved after ca 
4.5h following the administration of 100 mg Risperidone ISM. For oral risperidone, 65% RO is reached 
within 1-2h for both 3 and 4 mg. The provided simulations showed that the initial active moiety exposure 
and RO are in the same range for oral risperidone 4 mg and Risperidone ISM 100 mg. Therefore, bridging 
of the indication is supported from a PK standpoint, particularly since 100 mg is the only dose that the 
applicant claims for acute schizophrenia.     
Given the smaller amplitude of the initial release after 75 mg Risperidone ISM, sufficient receptor 
occupancy is reached ca 13h later. It is unclear whether this delay would have a significant effect on 
PANSS or whether PANSS is sensitive enough to detect differences in tmax on day 1, when the full 
response is not expected until a few weeks later. In consequence, additional efficacy data would be 
required to support that this delay is not clinically relevant for 75 mg Risperidone ISM. This dose is 
however currently not claimed in the acute schizophrenia indication, the issue is therefore not pursued.  
Even though the AUC after Risperidone ISM may be in the same range as for oral risperidone, it is noted, 
both in the BORIS study and in simulations based on literature data, that Risperidone ISM results in lower 
plasma concentrations of active moiety between day 10 and 15 approximately. This concentration seems 
to be in the range of the oral Cmin. It is however unclear whether a prolonged time at this concentration 
may have an impact on clinical efficacy. The applicant provided a new analysis of PANSS expressed as 
percentage from baseline and as function of time to investigate the effect of the lower plasma 
concentrations of active moiety between Day 10 and 15 with a focus on the lowest quartile of exposure. 
The absence of obvious trend between the PANSS score and the lower active moiety exposure between 
day 8-15 is agreed, however PANSS may be not sufficiently sensitive over such a timeframe. The value of 
the present exposure/response analysis for the information on the lack of impact on efficacy is therefore 
limited in this context. The SmPC section 5.2 was updated to reflect this dip in concentration.  
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
All three individual methods were adequately validated. There was however no cross-validation between 
the different methods. A cross validation is not requested since the residual error between the methods 
was not significant according to pop PK modelling. 
Within study validation reports were provided for all clinical studies. Samples were measured within their 
studied stability, and incurred sample reanalysis was passed where required. The measured plasma 
exposures are thus deemed reliable.  
Population PK analysis 
The model could reasonably well describe the concentration-time data of active moiety after 
administration of Risperidone ISM. Epsilon shrinkage was rather high (25.5%). In addition, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 45/100 
 
 
 
η-shrinkage was high (44-66%) for many parameters (FR, FR1, K14, K24, K34 and D3). Lower η-shrinkage 
(<25%) was observed for CL, V4 and F5.  
There were some trends in the plot of eta for CL40 versus dose, especially for the doses 37.5 and 50 mg. 
This could not be explained by a different CL in dose groups 37.5 and 50 mg. The reason for the trend in 
the plot is still unclear. However, these dose groups include a different formulation and lower doses (lower 
concentration range) than intended for clinical use, for which reason this issue is not further pursued. 
The provided VPCs and pcVPC plots stratified by injection site and dose per study showed that the Pop PK 
model could reasonably well describe the plasma concentrations of active moiety of Risperidone ISM.  
The applicant’s method for handling outliers and values below the LLOQ is considered acceptable.  
Different dosing schemes for the switch between risperidone oral, ISM and LAI were simulated. The oral 
Pop PK model of risperidone was based on a model previously reported in the literature (Vermeulen, 
2007). The applicant explained that the model could initially not describe the simulated peak and trough 
active moiety concentrations reported by Samtani et al, 2012, and therefore the parameters (V2 and V4) 
were re-estimated during the development of a combined Risperidone ISM and Risperidone Oral model. 
The updated oral model (with the new estimates of V2 and V4) seemed to adequately describe the 
exposure data in the article from Samtani and in the BORIS study, and is therefore considered acceptable 
to use for simulations. PcVPCs based on the BORIS study and BORIS-2 study, showed that the oral Pop PK 
model reasonably well described the data in both the studies.  
Concentration-time profiles of active moiety following the administration of Risperidone LAI were 
adequately digitised from simulated profiles in a publication. There was no information regarding the 
input data and PK model that was used in the simulations in the publication. The assessor can therefore 
not validate these data. However, the concentration-time data of active moiety at steady state are in the 
same ranges as those previously reported for risperidone LAI and the data in the publication is therefore 
considered to be acceptable.  
Absorption 
The three studies performed with early formulations (ROV-RISP-2009-01, PRISMA-1 and PRISMA-2) are 
considered supportive and acceptable to include in the population PK model, but should not be used 
alone, as the early formulations are considered to have different release properties.  
Single dose PK with the final formulation is available from study ROV-RISP-2020-02. The elimination of a 
100mg single dose the final formulation beyond the last day of the dosing interval was studied in the new 
study ROV-RISP-2020-02. This data is now reflected in the SmPC section 5.2 under elimination and 
absorption.  
Resulting from the complex absorption upon modified release, several peaks of concentrations are seen 
for risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and the active moiety. Tmax should therefore be interpreted with 
caution in all studies. 
Comparative dissolution profiles for the EU and US sources Risperdal tablets were only performed in HCl 
0.1N pH 1.2 dissolution medium and not at the range of pH 1 – 6.8 (at least pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8) required 
in the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. This issue is however not pursued since it is an in 
vivo bridge that is required.  
Distribution 
The protein binding of risperidone and its metabolite is well-known, and the applicant did not conduct own 
studies.  
Elimination 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 46/100 
 
 
 
The excretion route and metabolism of risperidone are well known, and the applicant did not conduct own 
studies. The applicant provided an analysis comparing exposure and parent/metabolite ratios after oral or 
intramuscular administration of risperidone. The applicant did not address possible pre-systemic 
differences in metabolic pathways. As the systemic exposures are similar, it is agreed that the PK in 
special populations or interactions may be similar to those from the reference product and that these 
SmPC claims can be used also for Risperidone ISM.    
The consequences of genetic polymorphism on the PK of risperidone are well-known and well described in 
the clinical studies. As it is mainly the active moiety, as a sum of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone, that 
is studied here with respect to bridging to the reference product, the impact of a polymorphism of CYP2D6 
is low. 
Dose proportionality 
Single dose data from the PRISMA-3 study showed a proportional increase in active moiety exposure 
(Cmax, AUC) with dose in the range 75 to 100 mg. However, the pop PK model does not support dose 
proportionality for doses below 75 mg. The SmPC was updated to state that dose proportionality is 
demonstrated between 75 and 100 mg.  
Time dependency 
Risperidone ISM did not demonstrate time dependency. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The inter-individual variability is in the same range for oral and ISM risperidone.  
The inter-individual variability in CL40, V4 and most of the absorption parameters (FR, FR1, K14, D3, K34) 
were low to moderate. A high variability was observed between the subjects based on K24. Inter-occasion 
variability was low to moderate for FR, FR1, K34 and FBA and very high for FR2. 
PK in target population 
Overall, the PK in the target population did not differ from other populations, as it could be described with 
the same population PK model. 
The analysis of PRISMA-3 (ANOVA results) showed that PK for risperidone, 9-OH risperidone and 
risperidone active moiety, the dose normalised Cmax or AUCtau differ significantly for the gluteal and 
deltoid injection sites. The population PK model also identifies the injection site as a significant covariate. 
The differences can be attributed to lower and unbalanced sample size in group of patients receiving 
deltoid injection. In addition, despite statistically significant results, PKPD simulation showed negligible 
impact on total PANSS. No differences in safety profile of Risperidone ISM depending on the site of 
administration were observed. It is therefore agreed that administration in the gluteus or deltoid are 
similar. The SmPC has been updated accordingly and simplified. A few additional suggestions are made, 
see SmPC comments. 
Overall, the approach of simulating the switch from risperidone oral or LAI to Risperidone ISM is 
considered acceptable.  
While generally switching from 3 mg/day oral risperidone to 75 mg Risperidone ISM is agreed, it should 
be clear to the prescriber that the switch is not intended for patients on oral doses lower than 3 mg/day. 
The SmPC was amended accordingly. 
The switching from oral QD 3 and 4 mg risperidone to q4w 75 and 100 mg Risperidone ISM, respectively 
was predicted to result in fairly similar exposures with a steady state reached from the second injection 
onwards. The Cmax seemed higher after administration of Risperidone ISM as compared to oral

risperidone. The switch from oral risperidone to Risperidone ISM seems acceptable, based on exposure, 
using the proposed dosing regimens. 
The switching from q2w 37.5 and 50 mg risperidone LAI to 75 and 100 mg Risperidone ISM, respectively 
was predicted to result in a steady state reached from the second injection onwards. Larger fluctuations, 
with a higher Cmax and lower Cmin, were observed for Risperidone ISM as compared to risperidone LAI. The 
applicant provided simulations of D2 receptor occupancy and active moiety concentrations on the switch 
from risperidone LAI to ISM to show the clinical consequences of the larger fluctuations after 
administration of Risperidone ISM. The simulations indicate lower concentrations and consequently 
receptor occupancy (<65%) for a few days following the switch from risperidone LAI 37.5 and 50 mg Q2W 
to Risperidone ISM 75 and 100 mg Q4W, respectively. The median concentrations decreased to 
approximately 12 ng/mL (75 mg ISM) and 15 ng/mL (100 mg ISM), which is approximately two times 
lower than the median steady-state Ctrough following 37.5 mg and 50 mg risperidone LAI Q2W, 
respectively. The proposed doses for the switch from risperidone LAI 37.5 and 50 mg Q2W to Risperidone 
ISM 75 and 100 mg Q4W seem adequate from a pharmacokinetic point of view.  
The information about comparable active moiety concentrations at steady-state and the larger 
fluctuations following the switch to ISM are now included in 5.2 in the SmPC. 
The applicant provided simulations from switching from Risperidone ISM to risperidone oral. Higher oral 
peak concentrations of active moiety were observed for up to approximately 7 days following the switch 
from Q4W Risperidone ISM 75 and 100 mg to oral risperidone 3 and 4 mg QD, respectively. The exposure 
seemed fairly similar at steady state, with a higher median Cmax after administration of Risperidone ISM 
as compared to oral risperidone. The simulations indicate that the switch from Risperidone ISM to oral 
risperidone, based on active moiety concentrations, at the suggested doses seems adequate. 
The window for administration of a dose is currently proposed as up to 3 days before or 7 days after the 
scheduled date. While 3 days before can be agreed upon, missing the dose by 7 days results in a decrease 
in concentration of approximately 50%, with its effect on efficacy being unknown. This should be reflected 
in the SmPC. Additionally, considering that the impact of a few days delay on efficacy is unknown, the 
posology should reflect the studied dosing interval, as all studies and simulations are for a 28-day interval 
and not a monthly interval.  
Special populations 
Initially, 75 mg Risperidone ISM was recommended for elderly, which was not in line with the reference 
product that recommends 0.5 mg twice a day with a titration to 1 or 2 mg twice daily. The exposure in 
patients 60-65 years was found similar to that of younger adults. The applicant refers to the referral of 
Risperdal Consta of CHMP (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CHMP/384879/2008), where the pharmacokinetics in the 
population > 65 years was considered comparable to the population < 65 years for Risperdal Consta. The 
oral product SmPC – which is carried through to Risperdal Consta after the harmonisation – however 
notes a 43% higher active antipsychotic fraction plasma concentration in elderly and entails a dose 
adjustment for the oral product. From a kinetic perspective, it is nevertheless agreed that elderly patients 
without organ impairment are expected to obtain similar exposures following a 3 mg oral dose as 
following a 75 mg Risperidone ISM dose, and 4mg po/100 mg ISM, respectively. A patient stabilised on an 
oral dose lower than 3 mg is however expected to have a higher exposure if given 75 mg Risperidone ISM. 
Therefore, it is suggested that only elderly on oral risperidone ≥ 3mg are considered for a switch to 
Risperidone ISM, starting with the lower 75 mg dose. The SmPC was amended accordingly.  
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment (RI / HI), careful titration with the oral product followed by 
75 mg Risperidone ISM is recommended, which is not in line with the half dose recommended with the 
reference product. Patients with mild (n=84) and moderate (n=3) renal impairment were included in the 
dataset. No conclusion can be made for moderate impairment. It is agreed that the current dataset did 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 48/100 
 
 
 
 
 
not show trends of increased exposure of active moiety in mild RI patients, thus the dosing 
recommendations are endorsed for RI.  
Patients with elevated ALT (n=11) and AST (n=3) were included. The applicant considers the dataset too 
small for any conclusion, and this is agreed. The dosing recommendations in patients with impaired 
hepatic function are in line with the reference product and are agreed. The text in section 5.2 basing on 
datasets too small for conclusions was removed. 
The Pop PK model predicted an increase in Cmax and AUCtau of 19 respective 23% in females as compared 
to males. No dose-adjustment is required based on gender.  
The model predicted an increase in Cmax and AUCtau of 10 respective 12% in males with a BMI of 42.9 
kg/m2 as compared to a BMI of 28 kg/m2. Simulations showed that in obese females (BMI ≥ 32.1 kg/m2) 
could active moiety concentrations potentially increase by 38% on average in the extreme case (morbid 
obese female with BMI of 42.9 kg/m2) compared to the reference patient (male with BMI of 28 kg/m2). 
The reason for the higher clearance, and consequently higher exposure, in obese patients (especially 
females), are unclear. The applicant has not discussed the mechanistic reasons for the higher exposure in 
obese patients. 
No differences in effect (based on PANSS score) were observed with increased BMI and the exposure in 
highly obese females is expected to be within the same range as approved for the oral reference product 
(up to 6 mg/day) (under the assumption that the requested bridging study with the EU reference product 
will give similar results to those from BORIS), and therefore is no dose-adjustment needed in obese 
subjects. Since no dose adjustment is required, no further information will be requested on the 
mechanistic explanation of this effect. 
No effect of weight or race on CL40 were observed in the Pop PK analysis, and dose adjustment is therefore 
not required. 
Interactions 
At steady state, Cmax of Risperidone ISM higher than after oral administration of 4 mg risperidone. 
According to its SmPC, an oral daily dose of up to 6 mg of the reference tablet can be given. Since the 
kinetics is dose-proportional within the therapeutic range, the steady state concentrations of Risperidone 
ISM would fall within the exposure expected for the approved dose of the reference product. Therefore, it 
is considered acceptable to refer to the reference products’ SmPC for interactions where risperidone is the 
perpetrator and not to provide own data.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
At steady-state, Risperidone ISM results in slightly higher active moiety concentrations than 4 mg oral 
risperidone. The exposure is however not elevated to more than 150%, which is the exposure range 
expected for 6 mg oral Risperdal. The pharmacokinetics of the oral product is dose-proportional within the 
therapeutic interval, and a dose of 6 mg daily is approved. Thereby the safety data of the reference 
product can be extrapolated to Risperidone ISM. 
Simulations of dose-dumping resulted in very high concentrations of active moiety (about 300-400 
ng/mL). However, there are some assumptions made in the simulation, for instance linear PK. This 
scenario is a hypothetic worst-case scenario and the validity in a clinical setting is unclear. 
Exposure-efficacy 
No exposure-response relationship was evident based on PANSS events in the studied concentration 
range. Maximal effect appeared to be reached at the lowest dose (75 mg). Steady state concentrations of 
active moiety >20 ng/mL seemed to reach a plateau of the concentration-response relationship. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 49/100 
 
 
 
The applicant argues that the Pop PK/PD model of PANSS score can be used for predictions of PANSS 
score over time for doses and dosing schemes of Risperidone ISM resulting in the same active moiety 
exposure range as in the PRISMA-3 study. According to the applicant is the EC50 value (4.6 ng/mL) 
comparable to values previously reported in the literature and also supported by the results of PANSS 
score in the PRSIMA-3 study. The applicant’s arguments are partly supported. The assessor still considers 
that there are some uncertainties in the proposed Pop PK/PD model, since it is based on a limited 
dose-range and an EC50-value with a large confidence interval. It is considered that the Pop PK/PD model 
can only be used to partly support discussions regarding the exposure-effect relationship of PANSS score 
in the exposure range studied in the PRISMA-3 study. The results from the Pop PK/PD model should not 
be included in the SmPC.  
Exposure-safety 
It would have been valuable to use safety data from all studies, however the exposure-safety analysis 
based on phase 3 data only is considered sufficient. 
No exposure-response relationship was evident based extrapyramidal and somnolence/sedation events in 
the studied concentration range. The risk of hyperprolactinaemia events was predicted to increase with 
increasing active moiety exposure. The risk of extrapyramidal and hyperprolactinaemia events seemed to 
be increased for Risperidone ISM as compared to placebo, whereas the risk of somnolence/sedation 
events did not seem to be increased.  
In the logistics regression plots of TEAE it seems like there are increased AEs at lower concentrations 
when based on the observed active moiety concentrations on day 2 as compared to the predicted average 
active moiety concentrations. The applicant discussed thoroughly why the point estimate for the observed 
TEAE event rate seemed to be higher at lower active moiety concentrations on day 2 as compared to the 
observed TEAE event rate at higher active moiety concentrations on day 2. The applicant considers that 
this finding is a consequence of the low number of events on day 2 with lower concentrations. The reason 
for this finding is still unclear. However, this is not considered to have any implications on the application 
and the issue is therefore not further pursued. 
The scores of SAS and BARS4 seemed to be increased for Risperidone ISM vs. placebo but no apparent 
relationship with active moiety exposure was present in the studied exposure range. The scores of AIMS8 
appeared to be similar among the three treatments.

Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy 
and Safety of Intramuscular Injections of Risperidone ISM in Patients with Acute 
Exacerbation of Schizophrenia (PRISMA-3) 
The confirmatory efficacy study (ROV-RISP-2016-01 [PRISMA-3]) was a multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of Risperidone ISM in patients with acute 
exacerbation of schizophrenia. It was designed to meet the EMA guidance (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96 
Corr1, and EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev.1;2012) and Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/270310/2016. 
Methods 
The study design included a screening period (planned duration 1 to 8 days) immediately preceding the 
baseline day (designated as study day 1), a treatment period (duration 12 weeks), a follow-up period 
(duration 2 weeks; not applicable for patients who entered into the long-term extension), and an optional

open-label extension (OLE) period (duration 12 months) followed by a 4-week follow-up period for all 
patients in the extension segment of the study. 
Patients had a diagnosis of schizophrenia experiencing an acute exacerbation. Following confirmation of 
eligibility, each patient was randomly assigned under DB conditions to receive 1 of the following 3 study 
drug treatments: Risperidone ISM 75 mg, Risperidone ISM 100 mg, or placebo. The randomisation 
scheme ensured that an overall 1:1:1 ratio of assignments to each of these 3 study drug treatments was 
approximated.  
After initial dosing on study day 1, each study drug (Risperidone ISM or placebo) was to be administered 
once every 4 weeks during the 12-week treatment period (ie, at study days 29 and 57).  
Study Participants 
A total of 565 patients were screened for the DB phase, of which 127 (22.5%) were screen failures, and 
438 (22.5%) passed screening are were randomised in the DB phase. Two hundred and ninety (290) 
patients completed the DB phase of the study and were analysed.  
A total of 174 patients signed the ICF for the OLE phase, of which 44 patients were de novo patients (did 
not take part in the DB phase). Three of these patients failed screening, and the rest (41 patients) 
continued into the OLE.  
The study was conducted at 26 sites in 2 countries, with the majority of patients in the United States 
(61.1%) and the remainder in Ukraine (38.9%).

Treatments 
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Risperidone ISM is a long-acting formulation of 
risperidone that uses ISM technology. Risperidone ISM 75 mg or 100 mg were administered IM in the 
deltoid or gluteal muscle every 4 weeks (study days 1, 29, and 57) during the DB phase and during the 
OLE phase. 
Reference Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Placebo was administered IM in the deltoid 
or gluteal muscle every 4 weeks (study days 1, 29, and 57) during the DB phase. 
Duration of Treatment: The DB treatment period lasted 12 weeks, the follow-up period after the DB 
phase lasted 2 weeks (not applicable for patients who entered into the long-term extension). The OLE 
period lasts 12 months with a 4-week follow-up period.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomisation numbers were assigned via an interactive voice or web response system (IWRS). The 
randomisation scheme automatically ensured that the study drug assignment for a given patient was 
random and that an overall 1:1:1 ratio of assignments to each of the 3 study drug treatments (ie, blinded 
Risperidone ISM 75 mg, Risperidone ISM 100 mg, or placebo) was approximated. 
In addition, the randomisation scheme included the following stratification parameters to ensure balanced 
distribution of assignment to the 3 treatments: country where enrolled and PANSS total score (ie, ≥ 95 
versus < 95) at baseline/randomisation. 
An independent biostatistician maintained the randomisation scheme key, which remained unavailable to 
all other individuals until after study completion and subsequent locking of the study database. 
On 28 September 2017, due to a noted error in the IWRS, potential accidental unblinding of treatment 
allocation to patients for blinded personnel was reported. It was concluded that there were 43 patients for 
whom the blinding was potentially compromised. The applicant has described the error that potentially 
led to unblinding. An error in the configuration in the IWRS information about treatment allocation was 
available to some personnel that should have been blinded. This may in turn have caused patients to have 
been unblinded. It has not been possible to determine if the potentially affected patients actually have 
been unblinded. The company has chosen to exclude patients based on if there was a possibility for 
unblinding, based on information such as logs from the IWRS. This is endorsed.  
The company states that no systematic component of potential impacted patients was possible to 
demonstrate. The company has also provided listings of the potentially affected patients and the 
additional patients that were randomised to compensate.   
Statistical methods 
Sample size 
The difference between the active treatments and placebo in the PANSS total score mean change from 
baseline to endpoint (primary efficacy variable) was assumed as a 9-point decrease, with a common SD 
of 20. In the calculation 2-group t-tests were used. 
A Bonferroni adjustment was used for the two doses. 
A sample size of 124 patients in the mITT population in each treatment group would have 90% power to 
detect a difference in means of 9 (SD = 20, effect size = 0.45) with a 2.5% 2-sided significance level for 
a Risperidone ISM group versus the placebo group. The power to show superiority of both Risperidone 
ISM doses to placebo using the above calculation would be at least 81%. Assuming a 5% dropout rate 131

patients per treatment group, or 393 patients total was required. This assumption was re-assessed at the 
interim analysis and used in re-estimating the total number of randomised patients required. 
As a result of the potential unblinding of 43 patients (see Randomisation and blinding), the total number 
of patients required was adjusted to 436. 
Statistical analyses 
Analysis methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was designed to show superiority of active treatment versus placebo in the 
primary efficacy variable. 
Two hypotheses were tested: 
a. H0,A: μRisperidone ISM 75 mg - μplacebo = 0 vs H1,A: μRisperidone ISM 75 mg - μplacebo ≠ 0 
b. H0,B: μRisperidone ISM 100 mg - μplacebo = 0 vs H0,B: μRisperidone ISM 100 mg - μplacebo ≠ 0 
with μ = PANSS total score mean change from baseline for identified treatment group.  
The applicant has used an MMRM model with a MAR assumption for missing data. The MMRM was fitted 
with country where enrolled, visit, treatment, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and 
baseline PANSS total score as a covariate. This model was applied separately for patients in stage 1 
(patients included in the interim analysis) and stage 2 (all subsequent patients) of the study, as well as for 
overall patients. 
 An ANCOVA model, using jump to reference imputations for missing data, was presented as a sensitivity 
analysis. The results of this analysis were in accordance with the MMRM. It would be preferred if the 
sensitivity analysis was presented in the SmPC instead of the MMRM. 
A hierarchical testing was performed for the primary efficacy variable (PANSS) and the key secondary 
variable (CGI-S). Other secondary efficacy variables analyses were to be considered exploratory. 
An interim analysis re-estimating the sample size was performed. The type I error was controlled for the 
sample size re-estimation by using predefined weights for the stages (Cui, Hung, Wang methodology).  
The DMC received the results of the interim analysis from an unblinded statistician not part of the DMC. 
The company states that the unblinded statistician was not involved in other aspects of the study with the 
sponsor that may have affected important decisions, such as protocol amendments. 
Hommel’s closed testing procedure was used to control the type I error while testing two doses. This test 
assumes independent or positively dependent p-values. An assumption of positively dependent p-values 
is reasonable. 
The planned main efficacy population was the ITT population. Due to an error in the IWRS (for discussion 
see section on blinding) some patients were potentially unblinded, and an mITT population, excluding 
these patients, was also defined.  
Intent-to-Treat Population 
The ITT population consists of all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug with a 
baseline measurement and ≥ 1 postbaseline evaluation of the PANSS. Analyses performed on the ITT 
population were as randomised. The ITT population was used for analyses of efficacy endpoints, including 
HEOR endpoints.

Modified Intent-to-Treat Population 
The mITT population consists of all patients in the ITT population for whom blinding was not compromised. 
Analyses performed on the mITT population were as randomised. The mITT population was used for 
analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
Analyses on these populations were presented for the efficacy analyses, with focus on the mITT results. 
Efficacy results were also presented for a PP and mPP population. In the ITT population only patients who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug with a baseline measurement and ≥ 1 post baseline evaluation of 
the PANSS were included. A strict ITT population with all randomised patients would have been preferred, 
but since few (5/438) patients were excluded due to this criterium, and the study was blinded, this is not 
likely to have affected the results. 
Results 
Two hundred and ninety (290) patients completed the DB phase of the study and were analysed in March 
2019.  
A total of 174 patients signed the ICF for the OLE phase, of which 44 patients were de novo patients (did 
not take part in the DB phase). Three of these patients failed screening, and the rest (41 patients) 
continued into the OLE. Patient disposition for the Randomised Population is summarised in Figure 16. 
Due to an error in the IWRS, 43 patients were potentially unblinded and thereby excluded and the total 
sample size was increased accordingly. Of the 43 potentially affected patients 13 had been assigned to 
placebo, 14 to Risperidone ISM 75mg and 16 to Risperidone ISM 100mg. Although the number of 
potentially affected patients is numerically higher in the higher dose group, there is no obvious 
association between assigned dose and potential unblinding, and the exclusion of the 43 patients is not 
considered likely to have introduced any bias.

Figure 16: Patient disposition for the Randomised Population 
Patients were evenly distributed across the treatment groups, with 147 patients in the placebo group, 145 
patients in the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and 146 patients in the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. One 
patient (84010013) was assigned treatment (assigned to the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group) but did not 
receive study treatment because they withdrew consent before receiving a dose of study drug.  
The OLE phase 
At the time of reporting, 215 patients received at least 1 dose in the OLE phase (OL population). Of these 
215 patients, 26 patients (12.1%) had completed the OLE phase, 46 patients (21.4%) did not complete 
the OLE phase, and 143 (66.5%) were ongoing. The most common reasons for not completing the OLE 
phase was withdrawal of consent (24 patients, 11.2%), AEs (7 patients, 3.3%), and hospitalisation for 
worsening, relapse, or exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms (5 patients, 2.3%). Other reasons for not 
completing were lost to follow-up (4 patients, 1.9%); and insufficient clinical response (2 patients, 
0.9%); and death, noncompliance, and other (1 patient each).

The primary analysis population for the DB phase (mITT) consisted of 390 patients. Forty percent of 147 
placebo patients did not complete the DB phase with 18/147 (12.3%) discontinuing to due insufficient 
response or worsening of schizophrenia, whilst 26% of the 144 Risperidone ISM 75 mg patients did not 
complete the DB phase with 6 /144 (4.1%) being withdrawn for insufficient response and in the 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg group 35% of the 146 patients did not complete the DB phase with 11/146 (7%) 
discontinuing to due insufficient response or worsening of schizophrenia.  
Numbers analysed 
The planned total number of randomised patients in the DB segment of the study was approximately 436 
(approximately 145 in each of the 3 treatment groups). Note: due to a potential accidental unblinding 
quality issue, it was considered that 43 patients were potentially compromised and were therefore 
removed; the sample size was subsequently increased from 393 to 436 to compensate for these removed 
patients. Approximately 100 de novo patients were planned to be enrolled in the extension segment of the 
study, in addition to rollover patients. 
The number of patients in each analysis population is summarised in Table 8.

Outcomes and estimation 
PANSS total score mean change from baseline to Day 85 in the mITT population 
The PANSS total score at baseline was comparable between the Risperidone ISM groups. The PANSS total 
score LS mean change from baseline was significantly larger for both Risperidone ISM 75 mg and 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg compared to placebo (Table 9). A sensitivity analysis using ANCOVA supported 
the primary analysis.  
The mean change from baseline was significant for both Risperidone ISM groups in each of the 
participating countries as well as for patients with a baseline PANSS score <95 and those with baseline 
PANSS score ≥95.

There was a progressive decrease in PANSS score from baseline to Day 85 in all treatment groups. These 
results support efficacy across the entire duration of treatment and improvement in PANSS.  
PANSS Response Rate  
The PANSS response was defined as a decrease from baseline in PANSS total score of ≥30% and is shown

P-values refer to Log Rank Test of Kaplan-Meier median time to PANSS response compared with placebo.   
Kaplan-Meier percentage with first response was higher in both Risperidone ISM groups than in the 
placebo group at all time points. The percentage with first response was similar for the 2 Risperidone ISM 
groups at all time points other than ≤29 days, where it was 22.2 (95% CI: 15.8, 30.7) for the Risperidone 
ISM 75 mg group, and 30.3 (95% CI: 22.9, 39.5) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The 
Kaplan-Meier median time to PANSS response was not estimable for the placebo group, 87.0 (95% CI: 
58.0, 99.0) days for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and 86.0 (95% CI: 84.0, not estimable) days for 
the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.  
The PANSS response rate at each post-baseline assessment time point was measured on days 4, 8, 15, 
29, 57, and 85. In the placebo group, the PANSS response rate increased at each time point up to Day 57, 
where it reached a high of 10.6% (14 responders; 95% CI: 5.9, 17.2). In both Risperidone ISM groups, 
the PANSS response rate increased at each time point and was highest at Day 85.   
During the first two weeks the response is modest but gradually increase over time.  
CGI-S  
CGI-S score mean change from baseline to Day 85 was the key secondary efficacy variable. The 
difference in the change from baseline to Day 85 between placebo and both Risperidone ISM groups in 
mITT population was significant (Table 13).

Change from baseline increased at each time point in all treatment groups.  
CGI-I  
The change from baseline between placebo and both Risperidone ISM groups in mITT population was 
significant. Mean change from baseline in CGI-I score at each postbaseline assessment time point was a 
secondary efficacy variable and was significant compared to placebo from Day 8 onwards for both 
Risperidone ISM groups. 
Change from Baseline in PANSS Subscale Score 
The mean PANSS positive subscale score at baseline was 25.3 for the placebo group, 25.1 for the 
Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and 25.5 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The change from baseline 
increased at each time point in all treatment groups. At Day 8, the LS means difference from placebo was 
-1.0 (95% CI: -1.9, -0.1) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -1.8 (95% CI: -2.7, -0.9) for the 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. 
The difference from the placebo group increased at each time point for both Risperidone ISM groups. At 
Day 85, the difference from placebo was -3.9 (95% CI: -5.3, -2.5) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, 
and -4.6 (95% CI: -6.0, -3.2) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The data were similar for the two 
Risperidone ISM groups. 
The mean PANSS negative subscale score at baseline was 23.5 for the placebo group, 23.3 for the 
Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and 23.1 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The change from baseline 
increased at each time point in all treatment groups. At Day 15, the LS means difference from placebo 
was -0.9 (95% CI: -1.6, -0.2) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -0.9 (95% CI: -1.7, -0.2) for the 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. 
The difference from the placebo group increased at each time point for both Risperidone ISM groups. At 
Day 85, the difference from placebo was -2.1 (95% CI: -3.1, -1.0) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, 
and -2.0 (95% CI: -3.1, -0.9) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The data were similar for the two 
Risperidone ISM groups. 
The mean PANSS general psychopathology subscale score at baseline was 47.7 for the placebo 
group, 47.8 for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and 47.4 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The 
change from baseline increased at each time point in all treatment groups. At Day 15 the LS means 
difference from placebo was -3.0 (95% CI: -4.8, -1.3) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -3.7

(95% CI: -5.4, -2.0) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The difference from the placebo group 
increased at each time point for both Risperidone ISM groups. At Day 85, the LS means difference from 
placebo was -7.3 (95% CI: -9.5, -5.0) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -6.8 (95% CI: -9.1, 
-4.6) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The results were similar for the two Risperidone ISM groups. 
The OLE phase  
The main study (ROV-RISP-2016-01 [PRISMA-3]) included an optional, OLE phase after completion of the 
DB phase, to assess durability of the effect of Risperidone ISM. The OLE phase was not powered to 
determine statistical significance and no formal statistical testing was performed. Descriptive results of 
the efficacy endpoints are summarised by treatment group and overall.  
One hundred seventy-four patients (39.7%) who participated in the DB phase signed informed consent 
for participation in the OLE phase of the study. An additional 41 de novo patients were assigned to 
treatment. The OL population consisted of 215 patients who received at least 1 dose of Risperidone ISM 
in the OLE phase of the study.    
After at least 365 days of treatment in the OLE phase, early treatment discontinuation was reported 
for 24.6% of patients in the OL population, 22.6% of patients in the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group and 
26.9% of patients in the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.   
The mean PANSS score at baseline was 71.3 for the entire OL population; 70.7 for the Risperidone 
ISM 75 mg group (N=116), and 72.0 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group (N=99).   
Decreases in the PANSS total score indicative of improvement were recorded for the overall OL 
population and all subgroups. The mean change from baseline to endpoint (the last postbaseline OLE 
assessment), in the PANSS total score was -10.7 for the OL population (N=209), -10.3 for the Risperidone 
ISM 75 mg group and -11.1 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group (Figure 19).

Extension Phase by Open-Label Extension Treatment (Open-Label Population)  
OLE: open-label extension; PANSS: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; SD: standard deviation.  
As could be expected, placebo patients who entered the OLE phase showed the most pronounced change 
from baseline in the PANSS total score.  
PANSS response, defined as a decrease of at least 30% from baseline in the PANSS total score, was 
reported at the endpoint in the OLE phase for 32 (14.9%) patients. This included 22 (19.0%) patients in 
the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group and 10 (10.1%) patients in the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.   
The mean CGI-S score at baseline was 3.5 for the OL population, 3.4 for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg 
group and 3.5 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. The mean change from baseline to endpoint was 
-0.5 for the OL population, -0.6 for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group and -0.5 for the Risperidone ISM 100 
mg group.  The mean CGI-I score at the endpoint during the OLE phase was 3.0 for the OL population, 3.1 
for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group and 2.8 for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.   
Overall response, defined as either a ≥30% decrease (improvement of symptoms) from baseline in the 
PANSS total score or a CGI-I score of 2 (much improved) or 1 (very much improved), was reported at the 
endpoint in the OLE phase for 90 (41.9%) patients. This included 43 (37.1%) responders in the 
Risperidone ISM 75 mg group and 47 (47.5%) responders in the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.  
Relapse, defined as either a ≥30% increase from baseline in PANSS total score, rehospitalisation for 
psychotic symptoms or use of adjunctive antipsychotic medication after stabilisation, was recorded for 20 
(9.3%) patients during the OLE phase. This included 12 (10.3%) patients in the Risperidone ISM 75 mg 
group and 8 (8.1%) patients in the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.   
Remittance, defined as the simultaneous attainment of a score of ≤3 for 6 months or more on 8 main 
items of the PANSS, was achieved after at least 365 days of treatment in the OLE phase, in 61.9% of the

Modified SAF, ITT, and PP populations were analysed because of a potential 
unblinding incident. The planned total number of randomised patients in the 
DB segment of the study was approximately 436 (approximately 145 in each 
of the 3 treatment groups). Due to a potential accidental unblinding quality 
issue, 43 patients were potentially compromised and therefore removed; the 
sample size was subsequently increased from 393 to 436 to compensate for 
this. Approximately 100 de novo patients were planned to be enrolled in the 
extension segment of the study, in addition to rollover patients. The number of 
patients in each analysis population is summarised below:

2.4.3.3. Supportive study - Study ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2)  
This was a multicentre, open label, two-arm, parallel design, repeat-dose Phase 2 clinical trial with an 
exploratory objective of evaluating the PK and efficacy of once every four weeks of the injectable 
formulation Risperidone ISM after four IM injections in the gluteal muscle or deltoid muscle at 28-day (±1 
day) intervals at one dose strength (75 mg) in patients with schizophrenia.  The mean efficacy 
parameters (PANSS and CGI-S) did not change from baseline values with mean CGI-I values of 3 
(minimal improvement) by Visit 48, indicating a continuation of psychiatric stability. There was no 
apparent difference in efficacy parameters between the two injection site groups. 
2.4.3.4. Clinical studies in special populations 
None.  
2.4.3.5. Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The clinical efficacy development plan of Risperidone ISM is limited to one Phase 3 study.  
2.4.3.6. Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The CHMP guideline for medicinal products including depot preparations in the treatment of schizophrenia 
(EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev. 1), states that “depot preparations are meant for maintenance treatment 
once a patient is stabilised satisfactorily on oral preparation” and “it would be very rare to start a patient 
on a depot preparation, as e.g. dose titration is not possible, an acute effect may be needed or 
undesirable effects may occur, in which case the preparation cannot be withdrawn”. Furthermore, 
“non-inferiority of a new depot formulation needs to be demonstrated vs. the oral formulation, or another 
antipsychotic LAI product can be considered”. “Clinical studies to compare efficacy of the oral depot 
preparation are deemed necessary unless a clear pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship is 
demonstrated for the oral formulation.” It is also stated that, “If the efficacy and safety of the compound 
are known and it is not necessary to show this in itself for the depot formulation, provided no new claims 
are made. However, it is of importance to know whether the new formulation affects efficacy or safety in 
comparison to the oral formulation.”

In the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/ 270310/2016), the applicant’s proposal for the study design 
was not supported. “In conclusion, the CHMP consider that the differences in PK, the expected differences 
in TEAEs and the intention to show the new claim of treatment of acutely exacerbated schizophrenia 
patients the Applicant should follow the CHMP guideline for medicinal products including depot 
preparations in the treatment of schizophrenia (EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev. 1) and the different 
proposals of clinical development programme including comparator arm such as risperidone.”  
It is noted that neither the CHMP guideline nor the recommendations in the advice were fully followed by 
the applicant. From an efficacy perspective, the initial main concerns were lack of ability to titrate the 
dose, to switch to another antipsychotic, and the lack of a direct comparison to the reference product. 
This hybrid marketing authorisation application is based on the reference product of oral risperidone and 
an established clinical effect. The PRISMA 3 study lacks active comparator which is a limitation.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the phase 3 study (PRISMA 3) 438 patients were randomised to receive 3 doses of IM Risperidone ISM 
(75 mg or 100 mg) or placebo every 28 days. No supplemental oral risperidone was permitted during the 
study. The rates of discontinuations do not raise concern. Due to an error in the IWRS, 43 patients were 
potentially unblinded and thereby excluded and the total sample size was increased accordingly. Of the 43 
potentially affected patients 13 had been assigned to placebo, 14 to Risperidone ISM 75mg and 16 to 
Risperidone ISM 100mg. Although the number of potentially affected patients is numerically higher in the 
higher dose group, there is no obvious association between assigned dose and potential unblinding, and 
the exclusion of the 43 patients is not considered likely to have introduced any bias. The statistical 
methodology used in the study is in general considered appropriate. 
The primary endpoint in the PRISMA 3 study was the change in PANSS total score from baseline to end of 
study (Day 85). Both Risperidone ISM 75 and 100 mg doses demonstrated a gradually increasing and 
mean difference over time compared with placebo, with no notable differences between the doses. In the 
key secondary efficacy endpoint mean change of the CGI-S score from baseline to Day 85 both 
Risperidone ISM treatment groups demonstrated better CGI-S scores versus placebo from Day 8 
onwards. Mean changes from baseline in efficacy rating scales were generally limited. Comparable CGI-S 
changes have been reported in similar populations in the literature.  
Risperidone ISM achieves therapeutic levels from the first hours after drug administration and provides a 
sustained release following multiple IM injections. Risperidone ISM 100 mg is near to being bioequivalent 
to 4 mg PO US Risperdal at steady state based on exclusion of non-compliant subjects (see clinical 
pharmacology sections). No relationship between the active moiety concentrations and the PANSS 
measurements was evident and some uncertainties were identified regarding Pop PK/PD model (see 
clinical pharmacology sections).  
The study included patients with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia and an acute exacerbation or 
relapse, who had a PANSS score at the baseline period between 80 and 120. At the screening visit, all 
risperidone-naïve patients received 2 mg/day oral risperidone for 3 days to ensure a lack of any clinically 
significant hypersensitivity reactions before the trial. Patients with previous history of being treated with 
risperidone did not receive oral risperidone at the screening and started directly with Risperidone ISM (75 
mg or 100 mg) or placebo after randomisation. 
Maintenance of effect of Risperidone ISM in previously stabilised patients has not been studied, except for 
in the open label prolongation phase of the main study and to some extent in study PRISMA 2. Support for 
maintenance is therefore based on extrapolation of efficacy and safety from the reference product. The 
CHMP scientific advice that concluded that “considering the differences in pharmacokinetic profile for this 
new formulation compared with previously established formulations of risperidone, safety and efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 75/100 
 
 
 
 
needs to be confirmed in the phase III programme for treatment of acute exacerbation as well as for 
maintenance treatment”. It is agreed that steady state active moiety concentrations over 20 ng/ml are 
likely at the plateau of the exposure-response relation and it is unlikely that small differences in PK would 
meaningfully impact the clinical response. The results of the OLE part of the PRISMA-3 study indicated a 
continued therapeutic effect of Risperidone ISM over a period of more than 1 year.  
Patients who have not previously been exposed to risperidone may not respond to, or may not tolerate, 
this substance. There may be genetic differences of metabolism, individual differences in responsiveness 
and tolerability, individual preferences, as well as other reasons why treatment is not tolerated. Efficacy 
endpoints in the main study, including the primary endpoint, aimed to demonstrate effect at Day 85. It 
was noted that clinically relevant effect may not be reached during the first 3 weeks. There is similar to 
the oral reference product.  
Patients with an acute exacerbation may require titration of an oral or parenteral immediate-release 
antipsychotic, as well as concomitant treatment with other drugs. Treatment with modified-release 
risperidone with 4 weeks duration will diminish the flexibility to provide other treatments if required.  
Efficacy was not assessed earlier than Day 4 and no subgroup analysis on risperidone-naïve patients was 
provided. Data on efficacy variables during the first 3 weeks is either probably not clinically relevant or not 
available due to limited numbers of time points for assessment. Full effect of oral risperidone is not 
received until after a few weeks of treatment. However, supplemental doses are not going to be 
administered during Risperidone ISM treatment, which is an issue. Based on pop PK simulations, active 
moiety exposure upon administration of 100 mg Risperidone ISM from 3 hours onwards is higher than the 
Ctrough of oral risperidone. Furthermore, 65% receptor occupancy is achieved after ca 4.5 hours following 
the administration of 100 mg Risperidone ISM and within 1-2 hours for both 3 and 4 mg oral risperidone. 
The provided simulations showed that the initial active moiety exposure and receptor occupancy are in 
the same range for oral risperidone 4 mg and Risperidone ISM 100 mg, supporting bridging of the acute 
indication from a PK standpoint (based on exclusion of non-compliant subjects).  
There is a dip in blood plasma concentrations of active moiety around Day 14 after each administration of 
Risperidone ISM. This is not accompanied by a corresponding dip in median PANSS total Score or CGI. 
Median Cave for the active moiety is approximately 7 ng/mL following 4 mg of oral risperidone, and for 
individuals with Cpl below this concentration there is a risk of sub-optimal treatment effect. The plasma 
concentrations are also low at the end of the dosing interval. The applicant provided detailed analyses 
revealing that the observed dips in plasma concentrations has not contributed to a potential lack of 
efficacy. No relevant increase in PANSS has been observed in relation to plasma concentration dips.  
The efficacy appeared to be similar irrespective of site of administration. However, the dose-normalised 
AUCtau was slightly higher for injections given at the gluteal site compared with deltoid.

2.4.3.7. Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
This hybrid marketing authorisation application is based on a bridge to an oral risperidone reference 
product which has an established clinical effect. The main basis for assessment of efficacy (and safety) is 
therefore based on bridging from oral risperidone. In addition, one phase 3 placebo-controlled study has 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022  
Page 76/100 
 
 
 
 
been performed comparing Risperidone ISM to placebo. The main contribution from this study would be 
the specific impact on efficacy (and safety) from the specific modified-release formulation and related 
consequences for treatment strategy.  
The lack of an adequate active control in the phase 3 study complicates the interpretation of the results 
with regards to both acute and maintenance treatment. 
The indication initially proposed by the applicant was: 
• 
• 
for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.  
for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients with acute  
exacerbation where psychotic symptoms are moderate to severe.  
• 
for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients previously  
stabilised with antipsychotics.  
Initiating treatment with a long-acting risperidone product in patients where efficacy of and tolerability for 
risperidone has not been justified by the data provided. Appropriate recommendations for a run-in period 
on immediate-release risperidone of at least 6 days for risperidone-experienced patients and at least 14 
days for risperidone-naïve patients have therefore been introduced in the SmPC. In patients stabilised on 
other oral antipsychotics (different from risperidone) stabilisation and tolerance with oral risperidone 
should be confirmed before initiating treatment with RISPERIDONE ISM.  
Regarding “Patients never treated before with oral Risperidone” the applicant’s proposal is partially 
supported. The provided justification for the proposed 14 days period with respect to the demonstration 
of efficacy is acknowledged. However, to ensure satisfactory tolerability and safety, longer period of 
treatment may be requited. Therefore, the SmPC now states that a minimum period of 14 days is 
required, but that the period should be sufficiently long to confirm the tolerability and responsiveness to 
risperidone. 
The subpopulation referred to in section 4.2 of the SmPC as “Patients with history of previous response to 
Risperidone who are not currently stabilised with oral antipsychotics (moderate to severe psychotic 
symptoms)” are patients with acute symptoms (“not currently stabilised”) and this indication was not 
endorsed. Therefore, patients who are not stabilised should not be included in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
The following wording of the indication was finally agreed: 
Okedi is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults for whom tolerability and 
effectiveness has been established with oral risperidone. 
2.4.4. Clinical safety 
This hybrid marketing authorisation application is based on oral risperidone as reference product and the 
established safety profile of oral and LAI risperidone formulations. The adverse event profile of oral 
risperidone is well established. The European Union reference date (EURD) is 01/06/1993. In the PSUSA 
2017 the post-marketing exposure is estimated at over 52 million patient-years cumulatively for 
risperidone. 
2.4.4.1. Patient exposure 
Overall, 579 patients were exposed to Risperidone ISM in the initially submitted application. 185 patients 
received at least 6 doses of Risperidone ISM (6 months treatment). 118 patients received at least 12 
doses (12 months treatment). 
• 
In the healthy volunteer study (Study ROV-RISP-2009-01), 17 subjects were administered 
either 25 mg (9 subjects) or 37.5 mg (8 subjects) Risperidone ISM as a single dose.

In Study ROV-RISP-2011-01 (PRISMA-1), 36 subjects received a single IM injection of 
Risperidone ISM (13 subjects in the 50 mg group, 12 subjects in the 75 mg group, and 11 
subjects in the 100 mg group).  
•  Eighty-one subjects in Study ROV-RISP-2016-02 (BORIS) received 4 mg oral risperidone for 7 
days and of those subjects, 73 received 100 mg Risperidone ISM every 4 weeks from Days 8 to 
92. 
• 
• 
In Study ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2), 67 subjects received multiple (4-weekly) doses of 75 
mg Risperidone ISM.  
In the DB and OL phases of Study ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3), 202 subjects received 75 mg 
(n=144) and 184 received 100 mg (n=146) Risperidone ISM, or placebo (n=147). Of the 386 
subjects treated, 111 subjects received at least 13 doses of Risperidone ISM during the DB and 
OLE phases, including 40 patients (10.4%) who received 13 doses, 7 patients (1.8%) who 
received 14 doses, 4 patients (1.0%) who received 15 doses, and 60 patients (15.5%) who 
received 16 doses of Risperidone ISM. 
Seventy subjects (32.6%) of the 215 subjects in the OL population completed the OLE phase of Study 
ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3), and 93 subjects (43.3%) were ongoing in the OLE phase as of the 30 
May 2019 data cut-off. Among the 52 subjects (24.2%) who did not complete the OLE phase, the most 
commonly reported primary reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (25 subjects; 
11.6%), a TEAE (7 subjects; 3.3%), and hospitalisation for worsening, relapse, or exacerbation of 
schizophrenia symptoms (6 subjects; 2.8%).

2.4.4.2. Adverse events 
The adverse events observed were in line with the established safety profile for oral risperidone and 
Risperdal Consta. Sixty-seven percent of the TEAEs were mild and only 5 subjects (2.3%) in the OL 
population reported a severe TEAE.  
Subjects in Study ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2) (dosed with 75 mg) experienced a higher number of 
both TEAEs and related TEAEs (88%) compared to both ROV-RISP-2016-02 (BORIS) (dosed with 100 mg 
[57%]) and ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3) (dosed with either 75 mg [42%] and 100 mg [53%]).  
Safety results for the 3 multiple dose studies have not been pooled as Study ROV-RISP-2016-01 
(PRISMA-3) is the only study in subjects with acute relapse (PANSS score between ≥80 and ≤120, and a 
CGI score of ≥4) compared to subjects who were medically stable in Studies ROV-RISP-2016-02 (BORIS) 
and ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2) (PANSS <70 and CGI score of <4), and due to differences in study 
designs.

Table 17: Multiple Dose Studies: Analysis of TEAEs Reported 
During the OLE phase of the Study ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3; data cut-off 30 May 2019), at least 1 
TEAE was reported for 134 subjects (62.3%) in the OL population. The majority (67.2%; 213/317) of the 
TEAEs were mild and only 5 subjects (2.3%) in the OL population reported a severe TEAE. 
A low number of patients were exposed for at least 12 months to Risperidone ISM in the clinical trial 
programme. The applicant provided updated data over the course of the assessment from OLE period of 
study PRISMA-3 and discussed satisfactorily the findings in relation to the known safety profile for 
risperidone.

It is noted, that frequency of AE was higher during DB period in patients treated with Risperidone ISM 100 
mg compared to Risperidone ISM 75 mg.  The applicant presented also the number and proportion of 
most prevalent TEAEs in relation to numbers of administered doses and time after administration during 
DB period in PRISMA-3 for each study month (week 1-4, week 5-8, and week 9-12). The applicant 
compared early to late phase after each injection (one column with week 1-2 + week 5-6 + week 9-10. 
Compared with week 3-4 + week 7-8 + week 11-12). 
Injection site reactions - Study ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3) DB phase 
Redness, swelling, and induration of the injection side were evaluated by designated study site personnel 
after each injection; patients assessed injection site pain after each dose using a VAS.  Across all 733 
Risperidone ISM injections (290 at baseline, 232 at Day 29, 211 at Day 57) assessed for a reaction, 42 (17 
at baseline, 13 at Day 29, 12 at Day 57) had any reaction reported. During the DB phase, the frequency 
of injection site reactions was low in all treatment groups. Overall, 8.0% of patients experienced any 
reaction of redness, swelling, or induration. In all 3 treatment groups, redness was the most frequent 
injection site reaction (6.2% of patients), followed by swelling (1.8%).  Few patients (0.7%) only had 
induration. Among treatment groups, the frequency of injection site reactions ranged from 6.1% in the 
placebo group, to 8.3% in the Risperidone ISM 75 mg and 9.6% in the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. 
2.4.4.3. Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
There were 2 deaths in the 5 completed studies: one subject  (Study ROV-RISP-2011-02 [PRISMA-2], 75 
mg Risperidone ISM to the deltoid muscle), a 56-year old , died from a sudden cardiac arrest, 
approximately 10 days after the third dose of Risperidone ISM, secondary to serious TEAEs of alcohol 
poisoning and drug abuse (acute cocaine intoxication). The subject died the same day (Day 66). The 
cause of the death was due to acute cocaine and alcohol intoxication with no relationship to Risperidone 
ISM. The closest measure active moiety concentration to the event was 23.62 ng/mL, which are within the 
therapeutic range, so a correlation between an unexpected high risperidone plasma level delivery, due to 
the nature of the depot injection and the death can be ruled out. One subject (ROV-RISP-2016-01 
[PRISMA-3, OLE]) took an intentional overdose (took approximately 60 pills of perindopril to commit 
suicide) and committed completed suicide (suicidal attempt, death). The event occurred 20 days after the 
most recent dose of investigational product (dose of 75 mg by IM injection in the left gluteus). The subject 
received 75 mg Risperidone ISM in the DB phase of the study. The closest measured active moiety 
concentration to the event was 20.30 ng/mL. This concentration was determined 20 days before the onset 
day of the SAE.  
The two deaths in the study programme do not raise any safety concern of relevance for this application.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
There were in total 26 SAEs reported from the multiple-dose studies (Table 19). The only serious TEAE 
occurring in more than 1 subject per treatment group was schizophrenia (placebo: 4 subjects, 2.7%; 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg: 2 subjects, 1.4%). Also, in the OLE phase of study ROV-RISP-2016-01 
(PRISMA-3) schizophrenia (6 subjects; 2.8%) was the most commonly reported SAE. Intentional 
overdose, completed suicide, insomnia, suicidal ideation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were 
reported as SAEs for 1 subject each (0.5%).  
The reported other SAEs do not raise any new safety concern.

2.4.4.4. Laboratory findings 
Hyperprolactinaemia 
The SmPC for oral risperidone shows increased blood prolactin is a common (>1%-10%) adverse drug 
reaction and there is a footnote for hyperprolactinaemia stating that it can, in some cases, lead to 
gynecomastia, menstrual disturbances, amenorrhea, galactorrhoea. Hyperprolactinaemia is one of the 
most common TEAEs reported in clinical trials with all antipsychotics. The highest prevalence of 
hyperprolactinaemia and severity of hyperprolactinaemia are found in association with risperidone and 
amisulpride. There is evidence that the major active metabolite of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone 
(paliperidone), is responsible for the prolactin elevation. The rates of hyperprolactinaemia reported are 
often as high as 80-90% of all female subjects. When data are reported in a categorical manner, there is 
evidence that almost all subjects receiving oral risperidone (72-100%) and risperidone long-acting 
intramuscular injection (LAIM) (53-67%) have hyperprolactinaemia. 
Table 20: Study ROV-RISP-2016-02 (BORIS): Treatment-Related Hyperprolactinaemia TEAEs 
In Study ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2), hyperprolactinaemia was detected in 59/67 subjects (Table 
21). The high incidence of events reported in this study was due to the frequency of sampling. 
Table 21: Study ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2): Treatment-Related Hyperprolactinaemia 
TEAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022 
Page 88/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For study ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3), all reported TEAEs (preferred terms of blood prolactin 
increased and hyperprolactinaemia) in the DB and OLE phases are listed in Table 22. Applying the 
protocol definition of a TEAE of hyperprolactinaemia to the DB phase, 36 rather than 55 of the 290 
subjects in the DB phase had TEAEs that qualified as hyperprolactinaemia. 
Table 22: Study ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3; DB Phase): All Reported TEAEs (First 
Occurrences) 
Hyperprolactinaemia is a known adverse reaction to risperidone and is expected in a high proportion of 
exposed subjects. The detected incidence/prevalence will depend on timing/frequency of measurement 
and definition of the event. The overall incidence of hyperprolactinaemia in the study PRISMA-3 was only 
7%, and the overall incidence of blood prolactin increased was 12% which is seen as substantially lower 
than expected, and also notably lower compared to the findings in the PRISMA-2 study. The applicant 
argues in the PRISMA-3 study, 124 out of 518 patients (24%) had prolactin levels above the upper limit 
of normal at screening; therefore 7% of TEAEs of hyperprolactinaemia and 12% of TEAEs blood prolactin 
increase represent new events. They further argue that the different incidence of hyperprolactinaemia in 
PRISMA-3 and PRISMA-2 studies is a consequence of the different study designs and patient populations. 
It is agreed that this may, at least partly, explain the discrepancy. 
That there is a difference may also potentially be related to the conduct and integrity of the study. 
According to the applicant audits described only four minor findings regarding the collection of adverse 
events, in 4 sites of 18 sites audited, no one related to the recording of hyperprolactinaemia/blood 
prolactin increase. It is further argued that the most common adverse reactions of risperidone, (dry 
mouth, vomiting, sedation/somnolence, akathisia, headache, insomnia, etc.) had a very similar incidence 
in all 3 studies. This latter statement requires a comment. It is noted from the provided table above that 
for most SOCs the proportion of subjects reporting adverse events is notably higher in the PRISMA-2 
study compared to the PRISMA-3 study. There is, however, no major difference between the frequency of 
adverse events reported from PRISMA-3 compared to the known safety profile of risperidone. 
Consequently, no major issue suggesting a problem with the integrity of the PRISMA-3 study has been 
identified.  
2.4.4.5. Safety in special populations 
Age 
No dose adjustments for Risperidone ISM are recommended for elderly people. In the pivotal trial 
ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3), however, only patients aged ≥18 and ≤65 years were included. The renal 
function normally decreases with age and chronic disease, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, 
have increased prevalence with age. Acute clinical events with a potential sudden reduction of renal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022 
Page 89/100 
 
 
 
 
 
 
function are increasingly common with increasing age. Patients with renal impairment have less ability to 
eliminate the active antipsychotic fraction compared to patients with normal renal function. Elderly 
patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of 
death and the indication does not include this population. 
Considering the absence of study data in patients >65 years old, the short duration of run-in on oral 
risperidone proposed, and the long duration of exposure from with this formulation, it is not obvious that 
this product is appropriate to use in an elderly population. 
It can be agreed that there is a clinical need for a prolonged release formulation also in the elderly. In 
general, however, the use of antipsychotics in an elderly population may be a concern regarding potential 
age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, comorbidity and interactions with 
concomitant medication. Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of 
antipsychotic agents, such as extrapyramidal and anticholinergic effects.  
The uncertainty regarding RISPERIDONE ISM concerns the safety of such a long-acting formulation in the 
elderly, without supporting study data. Exposure cannot be quickly reduced/discontinued in case of 
adverse effects and poor tolerability. Tolerance should be reliably established on oral risperidone before 
initiating treatment with a prolonged-release formulation. 
The applicant refers to an observational study (Lin 2020) comparing the effectiveness of long-acting 
injectable antipsychotics in elderly patients with schizophrenia with oral antipsychotics on time to 
rehospitalisation. The interpretation of this study is not fully agreed. The results indicated that the 
long-acting injectable antipsychotics group had a significantly lower rehospitalisation rate and a 
significantly longer time to rehospitalisation within 1 year of discharge than the oral antipsychotics group. 
While these results seem encouraging, this was a non-interventional study and the adjustments made for 
baseline differences were not exhaustive. It is expected that the group of elderly patients in the 
long-acting injectable antipsychotics group were selected by prescribers as particularly suitable for that 
treatment. This may have confounded the comparison.  
For oral risperidone the recommendation is to titrate the dose more cautiously to approximately half the 
dose used in younger adults. In the article 30 referral for Risperdal Consta in 2008 
(EMEA/CHMP/384879/2008) the CHMP also assessed the dosing in the elderly population and concluded 
that it was shown that the pharmacokinetics in the population >65 years are comparable to the 
population <65 years.  
Due to the absence of data on efficacy and safety of this prolonged-release formulation in elderly >65 
years, and in line with the SmPC for Risperdal Consta agreed in the referral 2008 
(EMEA/CHMP/384879/2008), a statement regarding the absence of data and recommending caution in 
the elderly is warranted in the SmPC.  
Hepatic and Renal Impairment 
No studies in subjects with hepatic or renal dysfunction were performed. Patients with renal impairment 
have less ability to eliminate the active antipsychotic fraction than adults with normal renal function. In 
patients with moderate to severe renal disease (creatinine clearance 59 to 15 mL/min), clearance of the 
risperidone and its active metabolite decreased by 60%, compared to young healthy patients. Therefore, 
risperidone doses should be reduced in patients with severe renal disease (creatinine clearance <30 
mL/min).  
Patients with impaired hepatic function have increases in plasma concentration of the free fraction of 
risperidone. While the PK of risperidone in patients with liver disease were comparable to those in young 
healthy patients, the mean free fraction of risperidone in plasma was increased by about 35% because of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022 
Page 90/100 
 
 
 
the diminished concentration of both albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Based on this, risperidone doses 
should be reduced in patients with severe liver disease (10-15 points on Child Pugh System). 
Dementia-Related Psychosis 
The risperidone labelling includes a warning on increased mortality in elderly patients with 
dementia-related psychosis. The applicant has included the same information for Risperidone ISM. 
2.4.4.6. Immunological events 
N/A 
2.4.4.7. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The interaction of Risperidone ISM with other drugs is expected to show a similar pattern as seen with oral 
risperidone. The safety aspect to be considered regarding potential interactions is the inevitably long 
remaining exposure to risperidone the patient will be subjected to if an interaction occurs that require 
discontinuation or dose reduction. The use of this type of product in patients with multiple comorbidities 
and anticipated need of multiple co-medications may not be appropriate. The applicant has added a 
warning in section 4.4 in the SmPC. 
2.4.4.8. Discontinuation due to AES 
Safety concerns potentially specific for the Risperidone ISM formulation are of particular interest. The 
applicant reports 6 events in 6 subjects leading to discontinuation in the Risperidone ISM 75 mg arm, one 
being a limb abscess. The abscess was on the thigh and the injection was given in the deltoid muscle, 
consequently distant and unrelated to the abscess. 
2.4.4.9. Post marketing experience 
Risperidone ISM has never been marketed and therefore no post-marketing data are available. 
Risperidone was first approved in 1993 as oral tablets. The safety profile for risperidone is considered well 
characterised.  
For risperidone, the most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system, psychiatric 
disorders and gastrointestinal system (European Medicines Agency 2008). The most common adverse 
reactions (ADRs) in clinical trials (>5% and twice placebo) were parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, 
tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach 
discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, 
increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and 
pharyngo-laryngeal pain. Somnolence was higher following administration into the deltoid muscle (21% 
for each event) compared to the gluteal muscle (6% for each event).  
Antipsychotic drugs can cause a potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome (NMS). Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental 
status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac 
dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, 
rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (European Medicines Agency 2008). In the clinical trials 
conducted to date with Risperidone ISM, no cases of NMS have been reported.  
Tardive dyskinesia is characterised by potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The 
risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022 
Page 91/100 
 
 
 
increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered 
to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after 
relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Importantly, the syndrome may remit, partially or 
completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn (European Medicines Agency 2008). Tardive 
dyskinesia has not been reported with Risperidone ISM in the clinical trials conducted for this application.  
2.4.4.10. Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of oral risperidone is well characterised and clinical experience is extensive. The 
international birth date for risperidone is December 1992 based on first approval in United Kingdom. 
Risperidone is currently registered in approximately 120 countries worldwide.  
The established immediate-release posology aims to individualise treatment and use the lowest effective 
dose for each patient with a target dose of 4 to 6 mg/day. Risperidone ISM provides an exposure profile 
in the studied populations that slightly exceeds what is seen with an oral dose of 4 mg but below what is 
seen with a daily dose of 6 mg. The overall safety profile of Risperidone ISM is therefore not expected to 
be different from the well-known safety profile of oral risperidone. This is largely confirmed by the clinical 
trial data from the Risperidone ISM development programme. There are, however, some observations 
that require further discussion. 
Due to the limited size of the trials with Risperidone ISM it is not unexpected that the severe adverse 
reactions NMS and tardive dyskinesia were not observed in these trials. These risks should, however, be 
considered in the context of a depot formulation where exposure will continue for a long period if such a 
severe adverse reaction occur. This is an important complicating factor when the risk profile is evaluated.  
Risperidone is metabolised to 9-hydroxy-risperidone, which has a similar pharmacological activity to 
risperidone. Steady-state of risperidone is reached within 1 day in most patients while steady-state of 
9-hydroxy-risperidone is reached within 4-5 days of dosing. Further, it cannot be assumed that all 
important adverse events occur immediately after maximum exposure is reached. The data from 
PRISMA-3 contains only 12 risperidone-naïve subjects allocated to received Risperidone ISM. No 
meaningful conclusion can be drawn from so few patients regarding the risk associated with initiating 
treatment with Risperidone ISM in risperidone-naïve patients. The need for a run-in period on 
immediate-release risperidone before initiation of RISPERIDONE ISM has been introduced in the SmPC, 
recommending a period of 6 days for risperidone-experienced patients and 14 days for risperidone-naïve 
patients.  
Only patients aged ≥18 and ≤65 years were included in the pivotal trial ROV-RISP-2016-01 (PRISMA-3). 
Considering the absence of study data in patients >65 years old, the limited ability to adjust the exposure 
level, and the long duration of exposure with this formulation, it may be questioned how appropriate this 
formulation is for an older population. For oral risperidone the recommendation is to titrate the dose more 
cautiously to approximately half the dose used in younger adults. In the article 30 referral for Risperdal 
Consta in 2008 (EMEA/CHMP/384879/2008) the CHMP also assessed the dosing in the elderly population 
and concluded that it was shown that the pharmacokinetics in the population >65 years are comparable 
to the population <65 years. Due to the absence of data on efficacy and safety of this prolonged release 
formulation in elderly >65 years, and in line with the SmPC for Risperdal Consta agreed in the referral 
2008 (EMEA/CHMP/384879/2008), a statement regarding the absence of data and recommending 
caution in older patients has been introduced in the SmPC. 
Hyperprolactinaemia is a known and frequent adverse reaction caused by risperidone. It is noted that the 
overall incidence of hyperprolactinaemia in the study PRISMA-3 was substantially lower than expected. It 
is also notably lower compared to the findings in the ROV-RISP-2011-02 (PRISMA-2) study. The finding 
may raise concerns regarding the integrity of PRISMA-3 and the process of capturing adverse events. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/11233/2022 
Page 92/100 
 
 
 
applicant argues that the different incidence of hyperprolactinaemia in PRISMA-3 and PRISMA-2 studies 
is a consequence of the different study designs and patient populations. It is agreed that this may, at least 
partly, explain the discrepancy. It is noted that the cut-off serum prolactin level used to define 
hyperprolactinaemia (above 1000 mIU/L without clinical symptoms, above 530 mIU/L if clinical 
symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia were present) was higher than in some recent studies on 
hyperprolactinaemia. 
That there is a difference may also potentially be related to the conduct and integrity of the study. For 
most SOCs the proportion of subjects reporting adverse events is notably higher in the PRISMA-2 study 
compared to the PRISMA-3 study. There is, however, no major difference between the frequency of 
adverse events reported from PRISMA-3 compared to the known safety profile of risperidone. 
Consequently, no major issue suggesting a problem with the integrity of the PRISMA-3 study has been 
identified.  
Safety concerns potentially specific for the Risperidone ISM formulation are also of particular interest. 
Injection site reactions are expected and overall do not raise a particular concern. 
The table in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been harmonised with the formal reference product (oral 
Risperdal). This can be accepted but for injection site reactions the information is based on data from the 
development programme for Risperidone ISM. Since treatment always should be titrated with oral 
risperidone before initiating Risperidone ISM, some adverse reactions are expected to differ in frequency 
compared to oral Risperdal, and harmonisation with Risperdal Consta is more appropriate. This has been 
applied to "Sedation/somnolence", "Unresponsive to stimuli, depressed level of consciousness", and 
"Rales, pneumonia aspiration, pulmonary congestion, dysphonia, respiratory disorder". 
2.4.4.11. Conclusions on clinical safety 
While the exposure levels seen with Risperidone ISM are within those expected from the approved dose 
interval for oral risperidone, and a similar adverse reaction profile is expected. The patient should be 
titrated on immediate-release risperidone and tolerability established before treatment with the 
Risperidone ISM formulation is initiated. The formulation still offers a challenge regarding handling of 
rare, but potentially serious, late adverse reactions. This should be considered in the overall benefit-risk 
balance. 
2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies) Okedi is considered bioequivalent with Risperdal, 4 mg, 
Coated tablet. 
Enough bridge has been established to efficacy and safety characteristics of the reference product. It has 
been clarified that treatment should only be initiated in adults for whom tolerability and effectiveness has 
been established with oral risperidone. No major safety concerns remain unresolved.

2.5.2. Pharmacovigilance plan  
Routine pharmacovigilance (PV) is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product and to 
monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures (RMMs). Therefore, no additional PV 
activities are required. 
2.5.3. Risk minimisation measures 
In line with the reference product, routine RMMs are adequate to minimise the risks of the product in the 
agreed indication.

3. Benefit-risk balance 
3.1. Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1. Disease or condition 
Risperidone in situ microparticles (ISM) (Okedi) is a new injectable long-acting formulation of risperidone 
claimed to provide therapeutic plasma concentrations early and adequate concentrations during the 
entire dose interval for efficacy without any supplemental oral dosing. A monthly dosing interval is 
proposed.  
The indication applied for is: 
Okedi is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults for whom tolerability and 
effectiveness has been established with oral risperidone. 
3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The need for long-acting antipsychotics (LAI) as a maintenance treatment for individuals with a history of 
non-adherence with oral antipsychotics is recognised. While there are several clinical advantages to depot 
administration of antipsychotic medications, the most important is improved patient adherence to 
treatment.  
A number of second-generation LAI have been previously approved for use either every 2 weeks, every 
month or every three months. Risperidone LAI (i.e. Risperdal Consta), is a q2w LAI of risperidone. Due to 
the inherent lag phase of this microsphere product, it takes approximately 3 weeks for sufficient amounts 
of risperidone to be released into systemic circulation and therefore, it has to be supplemented with oral 
risperidone for 3 weeks. No LAI has previously been approved for treatment of patients with acute 
exacerbations. 
3.1.3. Main clinical studies 
The legal basis for the application is 10:3 (hybrid application) with Risperdal, 4 mg, Coated tablet as 
reference product. The pivotal studies performed by the applicant to support the application are; 
ROV-RISP-2020-01 [BORIS-2]. This was a Phase 1, multicentre, sequential, open-label study to 
evaluate the steady-state comparative bioavailability of 100 mg Risperidone ISM injectable every 4 weeks 
compared to once-daily 4 mg oral risperidone in subjects with schizophrenia stabilised on oral risperidone 
treatment. Subjects on existing oral risperidone treatment (4 mg) continued the oral regimen for 1 week 
to achieve steady-state concentrations of risperidone. Then, a single IM dose of Risperidone ISM was 
administered. A total of 4 IM doses were given (each dose separated by 4 weeks).  
PRISMA 3. This was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, DB, 12-week long, placebo-controlled study 
evaluating efficacy and safety of Risperidone ISM (75 mg and 100 mg) in adults experiencing an acute 
exacerbation or relapse of schizophrenia. At the screening visit, all risperidone naïve patients received 2 
mg/day oral risperidone for 3 days to ensure a lack of any clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions 
before the trial. Patients with previous history of being treated with risperidone started directly with 
RISPERIDONE ISM (75 mg or 100 mg) or placebo after randomisation.  
Four hundred and thirty-eight (438) patients were randomised to receive 3 doses of IM Risperidone ISM 
(75 mg or 100 mg) or placebo every 28 days. No supplemental oral risperidone was permitted during the

study. After the main part of the study 40% who participated in the DB phase continued into the 
open-label single-arm phase of the study. An additional 41 de novo patients were included at this stage. 
PRISMA 2 was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, two-arm (deltoid or gluteus maximus muscle), 
parallel-design, repeat-dose study. The aim was to characterize the PK of Risperidone ISM over four 
injections in the gluteal and deltoid muscle at 28-day intervals and at one dose strength. There was also 
an exploratory efficacy evaluation included. 
3.2. Favourable effects 
The BORIS-2 study results showed that exposure of Risperidone ISM 100 mg is generally similar to 4 mg 
po EU Risperdal at steady state. PK simulations of the initial active moiety exposure and receptor 
occupancy are in the same range for oral risperidone 4 mg and Risperidone ISM 100 mg; thus in principal 
constituting a sufficient bridge to the reference product. 
In the PRISMA 3 study both Risperidone ISM 75 and 100 mg demonstrated a statistically significant 
mean difference in PANSS total score from baseline to end of study (Day 85) compared with placebo 
(-13.6 95% CI -17.8- -9.3 for the 100 mg dose) with no differences between the doses. The curves 
started separating at day 4 and there was a gradual increase in difference over time.  
The proportions of PANSS responders (decrease in PANSS total score of ≥30%) were 38% in the 75 mg 
group and 31% in the 100mg group, compared to 8% in the placebo group. In both Risperidone ISM 
groups, the PANSS response rate increased at each time point and was highest at Day 85. During the first 
two weeks the response is modest but gradually increase over time. The median time to PANSS response 
was not estimable for the placebo group, 87.0 (95% CI: 58.0, 99.0) days for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg 
group, and 86.0 (95% CI: 84.0, not estimable) days for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.  
The secondary endpoints showed similar and consistent results, with no relevant difference between the 
two dosage levels. The CGI-S score mean change from baseline to Day 85 was the key secondary efficacy 
variable. The difference in the change from baseline to Day 85 between placebo and both Risperidone ISM 
groups in mITT population was -0.7 (95% CI -1.0 to -0.5) in both Risperidone ISM dosage groups.  
The change in mean PANSS positive subscale score increased at each time point in all treatment groups. 
At Day 8, the LS means difference from placebo was -1.0 (95% CI: -1.9, -0.1) for the Risperidone ISM 75 
mg group, and -1.8 (95% CI: -2.7, -0.9) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. At Day 85, the difference 
from placebo was -3.9 (95% CI: -5.3, -2.5) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -4.6 (95% CI: -6.0, 
-3.2) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.  
For the mean PANSS negative subscale score at Day 15, the LS means difference from placebo was -0.9 
(95% CI: -1.6, -0.2) for the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -0.9 (95% CI: -1.7, -0.2) for the 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg group. At Day 85, the difference from placebo was -2.1 (95% CI: -3.1, -1.0) for 
the Risperidone ISM 75 mg group, and -2.0 (95% CI: -3.1, -0.9) for the Risperidone ISM 100 mg group.  
Among the 386 subjects treated in the open-label extension of PRISMA 3, 111 subjects received at least 
13 doses of Risperidone ISM. 
In the open-label study PRISMA 2 of patients with schizophrenia on maintenance therapy was no 
substantial change from baseline in the PANSS scores or CGI-S scores over the duration of the study (Day 
120 post-dose 4).

3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Even though the AUC after Risperidone ISM may be in a similar range as for oral risperidone, it is noted, 
both in the BORIS (2) studies and in simulations based on literature data, that Risperidone ISM results in 
lower plasma concentrations of active moiety between day 10 and 15 approximately. This concentration 
seems to be in the range of the oral Cmin. It is however unclear whether a prolonged time at this 
concentration may have an impact on clinical efficacy. There is no obvious trend between the PANSS score 
and the lower active moiety exposure between day 8-15, however PANSS may not be sufficiently 
sensitive over such a timeframe. The value of the present exposure/response analysis for the information 
on the lack of impact on efficacy is therefore limited in this respect. The observed dips in plasma 
concentrations have not contributed to lack of efficacy as measured by the PANSS assessment.  
It is noted that neither the CHMP guideline nor the recommendations in the CHMP scientific advice were 
fully adhered to by the applicant. From an efficacy perspective the difficulty to titrate the dose, to switch 
to another antipsychotic and the non-negligible reduction of exposure if a dose administration is delayed 
remain noted as potential concerns with the product.  
In the group-wise comparison the 100 mg dose did not demonstrate any benefit over the 75 mg dose. An 
increase in the dose from 75 mg to 100 mg, when not titrated on oral risperidone, carries a potential risk. 
Failure to tolerate the increased dose will be accompanied by many weeks of continued exposure. This 
type of up-titration of long-acting antipsychotics has, however, been approved previously by the CHMP 
and is therefore accepted. 
3.4. Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of oral risperidone is well characterised and clinical experience extensive. Risperidone 
ISM provides an exposure profile in the studied populations that slightly exceeds what is seen with an oral 
dose of 4 mg but below what is seen with an oral daily dose of 6 mg. The overall safety profile of 
Risperidone ISM is therefore not expected to be different from the well-known safety profile of oral 
risperidone. This is largely confirmed by the clinical trial data from the Risperidone ISM development 
programme.  
The most frequently reported events are in the central nervous system, psychiatric disorders and 
gastrointestinal system. The most common ADRs in clinical trials (>5% and twice placebo) were 
parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, 
upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, 
dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract 
infection, nasopharyngitis, and pharyngo-laryngeal pain.  
Antipsychotic drugs can cause a potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome (NMS). Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental 
status, autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac 
dysrhythmia), elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.  
Tardive dyskinesia is characterised by potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The 
risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to 
increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered 
to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after 
relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Importantly, the syndrome may remit, partially or 
completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Tardive dyskinesia has not been reported with 
Risperidone ISM in the clinical trials conducted for this application. In the clinical trials conducted to date 
with Risperidone ISM, no cases of NMS or tardive dyskinesia have been reported.

3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main remaining uncertainties are the risks from the very prolonged exposure if discontinuation of 
therapy is required, if a rare but severe adverse reaction such as NMS or tardive dyskinesia develops. Due 
to the limited size of the trials with Risperidone ISM it is not unexpected that the severe adverse reactions 
NMS and tardive dyskinesia were not observed in the trials. These risks should, however, be considered 
in the context of a depot formulation such as Risperidone ISM, where exposure will continue for a long 
period if such a severe adverse reaction occur. This is an important complicating factor when the risk 
profile is evaluated.  
While there is clinical experience from treatment of older individuals with oral immediate-release 
risperidone, the appropriateness of this specific formulation for older individuals remains uncertain. 
3.6. Effects Table 
N/A – efficacy of the new formulation mainly determined from bridging to the reference product. 
3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Other available LAI of antipsychotic substances are mainly approved for maintenance treatment of 
patients with schizophrenia. However, Risperidone ISM has a different PK profile compared to other LAI. 
It has demonstrated comparative bioavailability to 4-6 mg oral risperidone in a supportive study, 
producing adequate plasma levels within 24 hours. PK simulations of the initial active moiety exposure 
and receptor occupancy is supporting a similar bioavailability of Risperidone ISM 100 mg and the 
reference product.  
The PRISMA 3 study cannot on its own support treatment of acute exacerbations, even though this was 
the target population for the study. It is inadvisable to start treatment with such a long-acting formulation 
in risperidone-naïve patients (see CHMP guideline for medicinal products including depot preparations in 
the treatment of schizophrenia (EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev. 1)). It has been established that there is a 
need for a run-in period on immediate-release risperidone before initiation of RISPERIDONE ISM, and 
such guidance is now provided in the SmPC, with a period of at least 6 days for risperidone-experienced 
patients and at least 14 days for risperidone-naïve patients. 
Maintenance treatment with Risperidone ISM in previously stabilised patients has not been studied 
directly, except for in the open-label extension of the PRISMA 3 study and to some extent in the PRISMA 
2 study. Thus, this part of the indication is based on extrapolation of efficacy and safety from the 
reference product. This is not fully in line with the CHMP scientific advice that “considering the differences 
in pharmacokinetic profile for this new formulation compared with previously established formulations of 
risperidone, safety and efficacy needs to be confirmed in the phase III programme for treatment of acute 
exacerbation as well as for maintenance treatment”. It is agreed that steady-state active moiety 
concentrations over 20 ng/ml are likely at the plateau of the exposure-response relation, and that it is 
unlikely that small differences in PK would meaningfully impact the clinical response. In addition, the 
3-months assessments of efficacy and the results of the OLE part of the PRISMA 3 study indicated a 
continued therapeutic effect of Risperidone ISM over a period of more than 1 year.  
Unfavourable effects 
Assessment report

Page 98/100 
 
 
 
Risperidone ISM 100 mg provides an exposure profile in the studied populations that slightly exceeds 
what is seen with an oral dose of 4 mg but is below what is seen with an oral daily dose of 6 mg. 
Considering that oral risperidone is used in this dosing interval, these results seem reassuring both with 
respect to efficacy and safety. The overall safety profile of Risperidone ISM is therefore not expected to be 
different from the well-known safety profile of oral risperidone. This is largely confirmed by the clinical 
trial data from the Risperidone ISM development programme. It is the long duration of effect, the very 
purpose with this presentation of risperidone, that might generate particular safety concerns, should 
severe adverse reactions occur. Establishing tolerability using short-acting formulations is therefore an 
essential risk minimisation measure. 
As another consequence of the long duration of exposure, it should be used with caution in an elderly 
population, and only after reliably having established tolerability on oral risperidone with daily doses of ≥3 
mg.  
3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks 
Enough bridge has been established to efficacy and safety characteristics of the reference product. It has 
been clarified that treatment should only be initiated in adults for whom tolerability and efficacy has been 
established with oral risperidone. No concerns remain unresolved and a positive benefit/risk ratio can 
therefore be concluded. 
3.8. Conclusions 
A bridge was established between the data for the test formulation and the data for the reference 
formulation based by means of studies and through a scientific rationale. 
The benefit risk balance for Risperidone ISM is positive for the proposed indication. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information.

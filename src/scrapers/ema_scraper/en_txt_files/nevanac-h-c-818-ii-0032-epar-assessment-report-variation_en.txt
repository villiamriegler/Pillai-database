2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Macular  oedema  (ME)  is  a  distinct  complication  of  cataract  surgery,  It  is  characterised  by  an  abnormal 
thickening of the macula associated with the accumulation of excess fluid in the extracellular space of the 
retina or within multiple cyst-like spaces within the macula (ie, cystoid ME [CME]). ME and CME are common 
causes of poor visual outcome following uneventful cataract surgery. 
The prevalence of ME after cataract surgery varies from study to study depending on how it is defined. 
Whereas only 2% of patients were diagnosed with ME in a study requiring loss of visual acuity to establish 
the diagnosis, a prevalence of up to 20% has been reported by using fluorescein angiography in other 
studies. In most cases the oedema is transient, but some patients experience chronic cystic changes in the 
macula, which may lead to permanent visual loss.   
Some groups of patients have a higher risk of new postoperative oedema and the greatest challenges in 
terms of prophylaxis and treatment: eyes with capsule rupture, patients with a previous diagnosis of 
epiretinal membrane, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, retinal detachment, and patients with diabetes,  
especially those with pre-existing retinopathies (Chu, 2016). Additionally, cataract development occurs at a 
higher rate and an earlier age in diabetics compared to non-diabetics.  
In order to prevent CME after cataract surgery in patients at high risk of developing postoperative CME, 
corticosteroids are administered commonly due to their anti-inflammatory effects. If topical therapy fails, 
periocular or intravitreal steroids may be considered. Surgical therapy includes pars plana vitrectomy. 
Prostaglandins contribute significantly to the inflammatory processes that result in fluid leakage from 
perifoveal capillaries into the extracellular space of the macular region. Because topical non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for prostaglandin 
production, NSAIDs also may reduce the incidence, duration and severity of CME. NSAID eye drops are thus 
also currently used in clinical practice.  
About the product 
Nevanac  is  an  NSAID  formulated  as  ophthalmic  suspension.  The  active  ingredient,  nepafenac  (amfenac 
amide) is a prodrug that rapidly penetrates the cornea and is  coverted to the active metabolite, amfenac, by 
intraocular hydrolases. Amfenac inhibits both cyclooxygenase COX-1 and COX-2 activity.  
Nevanac is available in 2 strengths (1 mg/mL dosed three times daily and 3 mg/mL dosed once daily). This 
application is seeking approval for the addition of a new indication for Nevanac 3 mg/mL eye drops, 
suspension: “Reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in 
diabetic patients". The new proposed indication is already approved in the EU for the 1 mg/mL strength.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Nepafenac (amfenac amide) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic prodrug. After topical ocular 
dosing, nepafenac penetrates the cornea and is converted by ocular tissue hydrolases to amfenac, a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Amfenac inhibits the action of prostaglandin H synthase 
(cyclooxygenase), an enzyme required for prostaglandin production. 
Secondary pharmacology studies demonstrated the ability of nepafenac to suppress retinal 
neovascularization, while safety pharmacology studies showed that nepafenac had no adverse effect on the 
central and autonomic nervous, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, metabolic and renal systems. 
The initial toxicology programme included single dose studies (oral route), repeat-dose studies (oral and 
topical) of up to 6-months duration in several species. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans 
based upon the single and repeat-dose studies as well as genotoxicity studies. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional pharmacodynamics studies were conducted in support of this application. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In support of this submission, the MAH has conducted an ocular uptake and distribution study in rabbits 
following single (QD) and repeated daily (QD for 8 days) topical ocular doses of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL. 
The primary purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of nepafenac and its pharmacologically 
active metabolite amfenac (AL-6295) to posterior tissues of the eye. The results demonstrated that after 
topical administration at single or repeated doses, nepafenac 3 mg/mL is distributed locally from the front of 
the eye to the posterior segments of the eye (retina, choroid). The concentrations of nepafenac in the 
anterior tissues were at least 2-fold greater than the concentrations observed in the posterior tissues. 
Similarly, the concentrations of AL-6295 in anterior tissues were generally greater than the concentrations 
observed in the posterior tissues. 
Very low concentrations of nepafenac and AL-6295 were observed in plasma: Cmax of 2.54 and 13.9 ng/mL, 
respectively, following a single dose; and Cmax of 2.36 and 11.8 ng/mL, respectively, following repeated 
dosing for 8 days. 
Regarding the distribution study, the results demonstrated a concentration gradient for both nepafenac and 
amfenac (AL-6295) from anterior to posterior segments of the eye. The concentrations in the anterior retinal 
pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid and the anterior retina were greater than the concentrations in the 
posterior RPE/choroid and the posterior retina. Nepafenac concentrations in the anterior RPE/choroid and 
the anterior retina were approximately 16-and 6-fold higher than the concentrations in the posterior 
RPE/choroid and the posterior retina, respectively, after single dose. In the same way, AL-6295 
concentrations in the anterior RPE/choroid and the anterior retina were approximately 9- and 3-fold higher, 
respectively, than the concentrations in the posterior RPE/choroid and the posterior retina. In the case of 8 
repeated doses, a similar concentration gradient was observed. The anterior RPE/choroid and the anterior 
retina concentrations were approximately 11-and 4-fold higher (for nepafenac), respectively; and 7-and 
4-fold higher (for AL-6295), respectively, than the concentrations in the posterior RPE/choroid and the 
posterior retina.

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
No additional toxicology studies were conducted in support of this application. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  submitted  an  updated  Environmental  Risk  Assessment.  The  Predicted  Environmental 
Concentration in surface waters (PECsw) for nepafenac was 0.00105 µg/L, which is lower than the 0.01 µg/L 
action value. Furthermore, nepafenac log Kow value was 1.31, lower than the 4.5 threshold for further action. 
Consequently, nepafenac does not have to be screened for persistence, bioacummulation and toxicity and 
Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis does not have to be performed. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In support of this submission, the Applicant has conducted an ocular uptake and distribution study in rabbits 
following single and repeated topical ocular doses of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL. The results of this distribution 
study showed a low systemic exposure of the analytes and no evidence of systemic or ocular tissue 
accumulation. 
No new nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology data have been submitted in this application, which was 
considered acceptable. 
Based on the updated Environmental Risk Assessment no significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of nepafenac was expected. Nevanac is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that the non-clinical data provided by the MAH were adequate to support this 
application.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The applicant confirmed that all clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

termination 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
No new PK or PD studies were provided. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies have been submitted in this application. This was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP given the available data generated previously for the 3 mg/ml formulation at the 
time of the line extension to introduce this strength and the data provided for the 1 mg/ml strength in the 
same indication.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development plan of nepafenac 3 mg/mL for the reduction in risk of postoperative macular 
oedema in subjects with diabetes included 2 Phase 3 clinical studies (C-12-067 and C-12-071) with the same 
design.  
Additional analyses of Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) data from studies C-07-43 and C-09-003 
conducted with nepafenac 1 mg/mL were submitted as supportive data. These studies were previously 
submitted and evaluated when this indication was approved for nepafenac 1 mg/mL.

Outcomes Among Diabetic Subjects Following Cataract Surgery. 
C-12-071 - Randomized, Double-Masked, Vehicle Controlled, Clinical Evaluation to Assess the 
Safety and Efficacy of Nepafenac Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.3% for Improvement in Clinical 
Outcomes Among Diabetic Subjects Following Cataract Surgery. 
Methods 
Each study consisted of 9 visits, which included Screening and Randomization (both conducted 2 days to 4 
weeks prior to the surgery visit); the cataract surgery visit (Day 0); and 6 postoperative follow-up visits (on 
Days 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 [or Early Exit]). Additionally, treatment failure subjects whose ME was not 
resolved by the Day 90 were followed until Day 120. For these subjects, exit assessments were completed 
at the Day 120 instead of the Day 90 visit. 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria 
1. Subjects must have been 18 years of age and older, must have had a cataract, and were planning to 
undergo cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with the implantation of a posterior chamber IOL into the 
lens capsule. 
2. History of Type 1 or 2 diabetes and NPDR (mild, moderate, or severe) in the study eye as defined by the 
International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale and confirmed by the reading centre. 
3. Subjects must have had a preoperative screening BCVA of 73 letters or worse (as assessed using the Early 
Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] chart) in the study eye. 
Key exclusion criteria 
1. Pre-existing ME in the study eye as determined by SD OCT and confirmed by the reading center (CSMT of 
≥ 320 μm Spectralis or ≥ 300 μm Cirrus). 
2. Signs of vitreomacular traction or epiretinal membrane in the study eye as detected by SD OCT or fundus 
examination per the reading center or Investigator. 
3. History in the study eye of retinal detachment, ischemic maculopathy (may have been confirmed by 
fluorescein angiography if necessary), central retinal vein occlusion, branch retinal vein occlusion, central 
retinal artery occlusion, or branch retinal artery occlusion, exudative (wet) age related macular 
degeneration, chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease (eg, iritis, scleritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis). 
4. Prior procedures in the study eye: macular surgeries (eg, macular hole, epiretinal membrane removal), 
panretinal photocoagulation, corneal transplant, intraocular surgery or penetrating ocular trauma (including 
traumatic cataract), focal photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic ME within 6 months of the 
preoperative visit (peripheral retina treatment for retinal tear or lattice degeneration was permitted). 
Subjects were to be excluded from participation if they used:

- 
Intraocular/periocular steroids or antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy in the study eye 
within 6 months prior to surgery 
-  Systemic steroids (excluding nasal, inhaled, or topical dermal steroids) or topical ocular steroids in 
the study eye within 14 days prior to surgery 
- 
Topical ocular NSAIDs in the study eye or systemic NSAIDs (except aspirin at a maximal dose of 325 
mg) within 7 days prior to surgery 
-  Daily doses of topical ocular NSAIDs or steroids in the nonstudy eye 1 day prior to surgery 
- 
Topical ophthalmic prostaglandins (eg, Travatan, Xalatan) in the study eye within 4 days prior to 
surgery 
-  Supplemental niacin (≥ 3 g/day), or medications that had known or suspected retinal toxicities (eg, 
hydroxychloroquinine and phenothiazines). 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomized to receive either Nepafenac 0.3% or Vehicle; the assigned investigational 
product was to be instilled in the study once daily beginning the day prior to surgery and concluding on Day 
90 post-surgery. Subjects also received 1 drop of study drug 30 to 120 minutes prior to the scheduled 
cataract surgery on Day 0. All subjects were to receive OMNIPRED or alternate prednisolone eye drops for 4 
weeks post surgery.  
Objectives 
The objective was to demonstrate the superiority of Nepafenac 0.3% dosed once daily relative to vehicle 
based upon clinical outcomes following cataract surgery in subjects with diabetic retinopathy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The assessment was conducted at Screening, and Days 1, 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 (or Day 120, if applicable, or 
Early Exit). 
Primary Efficacy Variable: The proportion of subjects who developed macular oedema (ME) within 90 days 
following cataract surgery. ME was defined as an increase in CSMT of ≥ 30% relative to the preoperative 
baseline measurement as measured by SD-OCT 
Secondary Efficacy Variable:  
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects with improvements in BCVA of ≥ 15 letters from the preoperative 
baseline to Day 14 and maintained through Day 90  
The proportion of subjects with improvements in BCVA of ≥ 15 letters from the preoperative 
baseline to Day 90 
The proportion of subjects with improvements in BCVA of ≥ 15 letters from the preoperative 
baseline to Day 60

The percent change from baseline in CSMT 
 The change from baseline in macular volume 
The percent change from baseline in macular volume 
The mean change in BCVA from baseline 
The mean change in BCVA from Day 7 
Sample size 
Approximately 590 subjects were planned for randomization in each study in order to obtain 560 evaluable 
subjects. An evaluable sample size of 560 subjects was expected to provide approximately 90% power to 
detect a 14% difference between Nepafenac 0.3% and Vehicle in the proportion of subjects with BCVA 
improvements of ≥ 15 letters from the preoperative baseline to Day 14 and maintained through Day 90. The 
proportion of subjects in the Vehicle group who met this efficacy endpoint was expected to be approximately 
45%.  
This sample size also provides greater than 99% power to detect a difference of at least 13% in the endpoint 
of the incidence of ME (assuming this to be 18% in the Vehicle arm). 
Randomisation 
Enrolled subjects were randomized (1:1) to Nepafenac 3 mg/mL or Vehicle. Randomization was stratified by 
NPDR grade. The Interactive Response Technology was used to monitor the enrolment by severity to ensure 
that at least 50% of the randomized subjects had moderate or severe NPDR.  
Blinding (masking) 
Nepafenac 0.3% and Vehicle were packaged and labelled identically. The dispensing, collection and 
administration of the investigational product was made at each investigational centre by designated staff 
who were not involved in the assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variables.

Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized subjects who completed implant surgery and had at least 
1 on-therapy postsurgical visit. This analysis set was considered primary for the evaluation of efficacy.  
The per protocol (PP) analysis set included all subjects in the FAS who had no major protocol violations.  
Finally, the safety analysis set included all subjects who were exposed or were deemed exposed (ie, 
discontinued the study prior to surgery, but either returned an opened bottle of study drug or failed to return 
study drug) to treatment. 
Analysis of Efficacy 
For the evaluation of the proportion of subjects who developed ME within 90 days following cataract surgery, 
a logistic regression model, which included factors for treatment and the stratification variable of retinopathy 
severity, was performed to assess treatment group differences. An estimate of the odds ratio, the associated 
95% CI, and p-value were provided.  
The evaluation of the proportion of subjects with BCVA improvements of ≥ 15 letters from the preoperative 
baseline to Day 14 and maintained through Day 90 was based on a binary outcome (positive or negative), 
which was derived using the change from the preoperative baseline in BCVA at Days 14, 30, 60, and 90. A 
positive outcome required an improvement from the preoperative baseline in BCVA of ≥ 15 letters at all 4 
time points; any other outcome was considered negative. A subject with missing BCVA values at 1 or more 
time points was considered to have had a negative outcome. A logistic regression model, which included 
terms for treatment and the stratification variable of retinopathy severity, was employed for the analysis of 
this endpoint. The primary inference was based on the odds ratio of a positive outcome. An estimate of the 
odds ratio, the associated 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value were provided, along with the 
difference in proportions and the associated CIs. A similar approach was employed to analyze the remaining 
secondary efficacy endpoints associated with changes in BCVA. 
The analyses of the supportive endpoints were descriptive in nature. A logistic regression model, which 
included terms for treatment and the stratification variable of retinopathy severity, was employed for the 
analysis of the proportion of subjects who were treatment failures. Endpoints related to changes or percent 
changes from baseline were analyzed using mixed model repeated measures analysis, with terms for the 
corresponding baseline measurements (BCVA, macular thickness, or macular volume), treatment, 
stratification factor (retinopathy severity), study visit, and treatment-by-study visit interaction; the analysis 
of the change in BCVA from Day 7 was adjusted for the Day 7 BCVA measurement instead of for the baseline 
BCVA measurement. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used to account for within-subject 
correlation in the repeated measures. In case of model nonconvergence, a simpler variance-covariance 
matrix was employed. Within-treatment estimates of the mean changes from baseline by visit and the 
associated 95% CIs were provided, along with an estimate of the differences in means by visit and the 
associated 95% CIs were provided.

Recruitment 
Study C-12-067 was conducted mainly in the US (~84% of the subjects from US sites) and additional sites 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. Study C-12-071 was conducted globally, with sites in Asia, Australia, 
Europe, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East and the US.  Of the 582 subjects contributing to the primary 
analysis set (FAS) in Study C-12-071, 172 subjects (29.6%) were from 6 countries (Austria, France, 
Germany, Italy, Spain and Hungary) in the EU.

Conduct of the study 
Both studies were amended to exclude the use of silicone IOLs for implantation.  
Study 067 was amended to include Latin America and the Caribbean to increase the number of 
investigational centres (from 55 to 70), and to update the storage requirements for the investigational 
products. It was also clarified that alternate forms of prednisolone eye drops could have been used as 
required concomitant medication in the study if OMNIPRED was not marketed or available in the applicable 
country and that the Day 120 follow-up visit would serve as the Exit Visit for subjects with treatment failures 
whose ME was unresolved by the Day 90 visit. 
Study 071 was amended to make clarifications regarding the dosing rationale, to prohibit the concomitant 
use of contact lenses, and to exclude subjects with known medical histories of intolerance to fluorescein. 
Baseline data 
The study populations (FAS) of C-12-067 and C-12-071 were similar in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and 
iris colour, as described in Table below.

Development of Macular Oedema (Primary Endpoint) 
Primary efficacy analyses of both studies C-12-067 and C-12-071 demonstrated that Nepafenac 3 mg/ mL 
significantly reduced the risk of ME development following cataract surgery compared to vehicle. The results 
of per protocol analysis were also consistent between the studies.

Supportive endpoints 
Mean change and percentage change from pre-operative baseline in CSMT to each visit 
In both studies, subjects in Nepafenac 3 mg/mL group had less increase in CSMT from pre-operative 
baseline compared to the vehicle group at all post-operative visits from Day 7 to Day 90 (p< 0.05 at all visits 
in both studies).

Table 18  Study 071: Analysis of Change from Baseline in BCVA (Full Analysis Set) 
Only Study 067 showed a significant difference between groups (18.7%; p<0.001) in the percentage of 
patients with an increase in BCVA of more than 15 letters. In Study 071 the difference between Nepafenac 
and Vehicle groups was -1.8% (p=0.671). No difference was shown in the remaining visual acuity-related 
measures. 
No significant differences between groups were observed in mean BCVA change and ultimate BCVA was 
excellent in both groups at the end of the studies.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The observed efficacy 
of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL for reducing the risk of ME occurrence was consistent across all subgroups defined by 
demographic factors (age, gender, race and iris color) and baseline retinopathy severity, in C-12-067 and 
C-12-071. 
In C-12-067, the observed efficacy of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL in improving visual outcomes was consistent 
across all subgroups defined by the demographics factors and baseline retinopathy severity. In C-12-071, 
there was no consistency in any subgroup with the overall results; directional inconsistencies were noted 
with some results in favour of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL and some in favour of Vehicle.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled analysis of study C-12-067 and C-12-071 
A  pooled  analysis  showed  that  a  lower  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  Nepafenac  3  mg/mL  group  (4.1%) 
developed ME within 90 days following surgery compared to vehicle group (15.9%; p < 0.001). 
It was also shown that a higher proportion of subjects in the Nepafenac 3 mg/ mL group (55.4%) achieved 
clinically relevant improvement of ≥ 15 letters from Preoperative Baseline to Day 14 and maintained through 
Day 90 compared to vehicle group (46.7%, p = 0.003). 
Visual outcomes 
The MAH has conducted several analyses to demonstrate correlation between the treatment and its effect on 
visual acuity. Additional analysis exploring the relation between ME and Visual Function were also 
performed.  
In both studies, subjects who developed ME had substantially lower odds (80% lower in C-12-067 and 50% 
lower in C-12-071) of achieving sustained gains in BCVA (≥  15 letters from pre-operative baseline to Day 14 
maintained through Day 90) compared to subjects who did not develop ME (OR=0.2, p< 0.001 in C-12-067 
and OR=0.5, p = 0.011 in C-12-071). 
Subjects who developed ME also had substantially higher odds of losing >5 letters (over 4-fold higher in 
C-12-067 and 3-fold higher in C-12-071, p<0.001 for both) and >10 letters (over 3-fold higher in C-12-067, 
p<0.001 and 2.5-fold higher in C-12-071, p=0.011) from postoperative Day 7. These declines in BCVA were 
observed despite subjects having been promptly started with rescue treatment once they developed ME (ME 
was defined as 30% or more increase in macular thickness), in some cases with multiple medications 
including intravitreal injections with VEGF inhibitors. 
Efficacy at 60 days post- surgery 
Nevanac 1 mg/ml posology was approved based on additional analyses, which showed that there was no 
additional benefit beyond 60 days of treatment. Similar analyses were also performed for Nevanac 3mg/ml. 
The responder rates (percentage of patients who develop macular oedema after surgery) are summarised in 
table  21  and  summary  of  anatomical  parameters  (mean  central  subfield  macular  thickness  by  visit)

Supportive studies 
Studies C-07-43 and C-09-003 were conducted with Nepafenac 1 mg/mL and were similar in design to the 
Nepafenac 3 mg/mL studies.  
C-07-43 study enrolled 263 subjects (133 in Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group and 130 in Vehicle group), of which 
251 subjects (125 in Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group and 126 in Vehicle group) were included in the FAS. Study 
C-09-003 was terminated early due to recruitment issues. 175 subjects were enrolled at the time of 
termination (87 in Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group and 88 in Vehicle group) of which 160 subjects (80 in 
Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group and 80 in Vehicle group) were included in the FAS. Both studies C-07-43 and 
C-09-003 have been reanalysed on the basis of the endpoints and analytical strategies employed in studies 
C-12-067 and C-12-071.  
Primary and Secondary Efficacy Results in the full analysis set (FAS)  
  Development of macular oedema (Primary endpoint): 
C-07-43: Nepafenac 1 mg/mL significantly reduced the risk of macular oedema development within 90 days 
following cataract surgery. A significantly lower proportion of subjects in Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group (3.2%) 
developed ME (defined as ≥ 30% increase from preoperative baseline in central subfield macular thickness) 
within 90 days following surgery than subjects in the Vehicle group (16.7%; p < 0.001).

C-09-003: Nepafenac 1 mg/mL significantly reduced the risk of macular oedema development within 90 
days following cataract surgery. A significantly lower proportion of subjects in Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group 
(5.0%) developed ME (defined as ≥ 30% increase from preoperative baseline in central subfield macular 
thickness) within 90 days following surgery than subjects in the Vehicle group (17.5%; p = 0.018). 
Although the definition of ME was the same, this endpoint was not pooled since the OCT used was different 
between the 2 studies– TD-OCT was used in C-07-43 and SD-OCT in C-09-003. 
  BCVA Improvement of ≥ 15 Letters from Preoperative Baseline to Day 14 and Maintained through Day 
90 (first secondary endpoint): 
C-07-43: A higher proportion of subjects achieved improvement of ≥ 15 Letters from pre-operative baseline 
to Day 14 and maintained through Day 90 in the Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group (38.4%) compared to the 
Vehicle group (21.4%, p = 0.003). 
C-09-003: A higher proportion of subjects achieved improvement of ≥ 15 Letters from Preoperative Baseline 
to Day 14 and maintained through Day 90 in the Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group (35.0%) compared to the 
Vehicle group (25.0%, p = 0.172). 
Pooled: A higher proportion of subjects achieved improvement of ≥ 15 Letters from Preoperative Baseline to 
Day 14 and maintained through Day 90 in the Nepafenac 1 mg/mL group (37.1%) compared to the Vehicle 
group (22.8%, p = 0.003).

Table 22 Summary of Primary and Secondary Endpoints (FAS)  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two randomised, double-masked, vehicle-controlled trials (Study C-12-067 and Study C-12-071) formed 
the main basis to support the efficacy of Nevanac 3mg/ml in the proposed indication.  
Both studies recruited Type 1 or 2 diabetic patients with non proliferative retinopathy and decreased visual 
acuity (BCVA of 73 letters or worse) at screening. This population can be considered to be at risk of 
developing macular oedema as a consequence of cataract surgery since a 4-fold increase in incidence of 
postoperative oedema has been described in patients with diabetes in comparison to subjects who did not 
have diabetes at the time of the surgery (Chu, 2016). The study population was furthermore considered 
representative of the target population in line with the proposed indication. 
Exclusion criteria aimed at ruling out patients with ME present at the time of surgery, ocular conditions that 
could increase the risk of development of pseudophakic ME or complications from topical NSAIDs. 
Concomitant use of topical and systemic anti-inflammatory treatment as well as topical prostaglandins 
(associated with an increased risk of CME) prior to enrolment were not allowed. The study exclusion criteria 
were considered appropriate.

The nepafenac dose selected in this study (1 eye drop nepafenac 3mg/ml instilled into the study eye once 
daily) was in accordance with that already approved for prevention of pain and inflammation after cataract 
surgery. With respect to the duration of treatment, the MAH has chosen a 90 day study duration based on 
the time period in which ME usually occurs.  
The evaluation of efficacy mainly relied on the presence of ME as measured by anatomic parameters. 
Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-contact, micron-level, diagnostic system that 
uses infrared light to provide high resolution images of the retina and retinal thickness. Two different brands 
of SD-OCT equipment were used to measure the macular thickness and volume and in consequence 
differences in measures could be potentially expected. In principle, it should not impact on parameters 
expressed as relative changes (e.g the primary efficacy variable) but it might do it on those variables defined 
as absolute changes (e.g mean thickness of retina). The MAH has provided further clarification regarding the 
risk of using two different SD-OCT equipments on the final outcome 
a)  a single brand of SD-OCT was selected by each centre 
b)  harmonization was carried out by the central reading centre 
c)  the anatomic variables (those expressed as percentage of change and the measurements based upon 
macular volume) were relative to baseline 
d)  although the frequency of use of the OCT equipments was different between the two studies, the 
distribution of equipments between treatment groups was balanced. 
Taking the above into consideration, the CHMP agreed that no relevant impact on the overall results would 
be expected.   
Overall, more than 1200 patients were randomised in the two pivotal trials. The treatment groups were well 
balanced with respect to demographic and disease-related baseline characteristics. Most of the recruited 
patients presented with moderate retinopathy severity.  Mean age of patients was around 67 years ranging 
from 30 to 94 years old, which represents the broad spectrum of the target population. A high proportion of 
elderly patients (66.5%) were included. 
All patients in the studies were treated with prednisolone eye drops for 4 weeks post-surgery. Although a 
synergistic effect of NSAIDs and corticosteroid has been suggested in literature (Kim, 2015), doubts 
regarding the benefit of additional use have also been raised (Kim. 2016). Without a control group not 
receiving corticosteroids a definitive conclusion regarding the role of each component of the association 
cannot be undoubtedly reached. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Both main studies showed a statistically significant effect of nepafenac with regards to the primary endpoint. 
Significantly fewer subjects receiving Nepafenac 3 mg/ml OD (2.3% in Study 067 and 5.9% in Study 071) 
developed  ME  12  weeks  after  surgery  in  comparison  to  patients  receiving  Vehicle  (17.3%  and  14.3%, 
respectively).  The  macular  thickness  was  substantially  less  in  patients  treated  with  Nepafenac  than  in 
patients treated with Vehicle at the end of treatment period (254.1 microns vs 268.2  microns [p < 0.001],  
in the Study 067; 259.7 microns vs 270.0 microns [p= 0.003] , in the Study 071) , and the mean maximum 
change from baseline in central subfield macular thickness in Nepafenac group was lower than the observed 
change in patients treated with Vehicle (2.7%  versus 13.2 %, respectively in Study 067 [p < 0.001]; and 
5.4% versus 13.1%, respectively in Study 071, [p< 0.001]). 
Only Study 067 reached the expected 13% difference between active and vehicle arms in the development 
of  ME  according  to  the  predefined  criteria.  The  difference  observed  in  Study  071  (6.8%),  although 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 31/50 
 
  
  
 
 
statistically significant, was of questionable clinical relevance. The MAH attributed the difference between 
studies to the better than expected behaviour of the Vehicle arm (incidence of 14.3% of macular oedema, 
which  was  inferior  to  the  rates  reported  in  the  other  nepafenac  studies  in  this  indication)  rather  than  a 
smaller effect in the nepafenac arm. This was acknowledged by the CHMP.  Analysis of demographical or 
disease related characteristics between studies did not provide additional reasons to explain the observed 
differences between studies.  
Given that ME may have an impact on visual function, it was important to establish if the observed treatment 
effect on ME translated into a benefit on visual function, measured as visual acuity. Only Study 067 showed 
a significant difference between groups in the percentage of patients with an increase in BCVA of more than 
15  letters  (18.7%;  p<0.001).    In  Study  071  the  difference  between  Nepafenac  and  Vehicle  groups  was 
-1.8% (p=0.671). Some positive trend was nevertheless observed in some BCVA endpoints in this study. 
The MAH submitted several additional analyses regarding the effect of nepafenac on visual acuity. A lack of 
clear effect on vision observed in Study 071 has been attributed by the MAH to a better performance of 
Vehicle arm, which was acknowledged by the CHMP. Consistency between the explored visual outcome 
variables was shown. When the benefit on vision was expressed in terms of responder rates (e.g. BCVA 
improvement of ≥ 15 letters, worsening of > 5 letters) Nevanac 3 mg/ml showed better responses than 
Vehicle in Study 067. Generally, a higher percentage of patients treated with Nepafenac 3 mg/ml (55.7% in 
Study 067 and 40.8% in Study 071) than those treated with Vehicle (44.3% and 32.4%, respectively) 
attained a 20/20 or better vision at the end of the study.  
A post-hoc analysis has been conducted in order to establish the correlation between the prevention of ME  
and the vision outcomes. Patients developing ME, regardless of the treatment received, achieved poorer 
results (lower rate of patients with ≥ 15 letters improvement [22.0% in Study 067, 33.9% in Study 071] and 
higher rate of patients with > 5 letters worsening [50.8% and 35.6%, respectively]) than those patients 
without ME  (improvement of ≥ 15 letters 55.5% and 51.4% [in Study 067 and Study 071, respectively] and 
worsening of > 5 letters 18.2% and 15.7% [ in Study 067 and Study 071, respectively].  
Two additional studies have been submitted: Study C-07-43 and C-09-003. These studies were previously 
conducted with Nepafenac 1 mg/mL in order to support the same indication for the lower strength. The study 
data were reanalysed in line with the endpoint definitions in studies 067 and 071. The observed response 
both in terms of prevention of ME and visual acuity outcomes was broadly in line with that observed in Study 
067. Given that the daily dose would be the same for Nevenac 1mg/ml TID and Nevenac 3mg/ml QD, the 
results of these earlier studies were considered supportive for efficacy demonstration.  
Although the trials’ duration was 90 days, the proposed posology for the 3 mg/ml strength was 60 days 
which  is  identical  to  recommended  treatment  duration  for  the  1  mg/ml  strength.  The  1  mg/ml  strength 
posology  has  previously  been  approved  based  on  additional  analyses,  which  showed  that  there  was  no 
additional benefit beyond 60 days of treatment. Similar analyses performed for Nevanac 3mg/ml have also 
shown that little benefit appears to be added when the treatment is extended from 60 to 90 days. As a 
consequence, a 60 day treatment duration has been recommended in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the data presented in support of this application, the CHMP was of the view that the efficacy of 
Nevanac 3mg/ml in the prevention of post-operative oedema in diabetic patients has been demonstrated. 
Although the effect observed in one of the 2 pivotal studies was lower than expected, the additional analyses 
conducted by the MAH  and supportive studies conducted with Nevanac 1mg/ml provide further reassurance 
on the efficacy of Nevanac 3mg/ml in the proposed indication.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation was based on: 
- 
- 
An analysis of the pooled safety data from studies C-12-067 and C-12-071 (Main analysis) 
A historical comparison between Nepafenac 3 mg/ml and Nepafenac 1 mg/ml eye drops, suspension, 
based on pooled data from 2 Nepafenac 1 mg/ml post-cataract macular oedema clinical trials (C-07-43 
and C-09-003). 
The safety assessment included the extent of exposure to study drug, adverse events and other 
safety-related parameters; slit-lamp parameters (inflammatory cells, aqueous flare, corneal oedema, bulbar 
redness, and corneal epithelium integrity (fluorescein staining)), intraocular pressure and dilated fundus 
parameters (peripheral retina/macula/choroid, and optic nerve). 
Patient exposure 
The development program consisted of 2 clinical studies (C-12-067 and C-12-071) including a total of 1191 
subjects in the safety analysis set (594 subjects exposed to Nepafenac 3 mg/ml). 
The previously conducted clinical trials (C-07-43 and C-09-003) of Nepafenac 1 mg/ml dosed TID in the 
same indication included a total of 419 subjects (209 subjects exposed to Nepafenac 1 mg/ml). 
Table 23  Overview of exposure to study drug - Post Cataract ME studies 
The great majority of subjects were exposed for more than 60 days. The median exposure was 90 days or 
greater for Nepafenac 3 mg/mL and Nepafenac 1 mg/mL groups (see Table 24 below).

Baseline characteristics 
Regarding demographic baseline characteristics see section 2.4. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were obtained as solicited comments from study subjects and as observations by each 
study Investigator.  
AEs were defined as any untoward change (expected or unexpected) in a patient’s ophthalmic and/or 
medical health in the clinical trials that were assessed as clinically relevant by the Investigator. In studies 
C-12-067 and C-12-071 AEs were also collected on a pre-treatment basis (from the time of consent up to the 
first exposure to the study medication) and a post-treatment basis (after subjects permanently discontinued 
the study medication until the time they exited from the trials). 
The assessment of AEs and their relationship to the study drug were performed by the Investigators 
according to their clinical judgement.  
Common adverse events 
The commonly reported AEs (≥ 1% in either Nepafenac 3 mg/mL group or in Nepafenac 1 mg/ml group) are 
listed in Table 30. The analysis of AEs was mainly focused on treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) i.e. 
the AEs occurred from the time of first exposure to the study medication up to the time the study medication 
was permanently discontinued.

In general, the majority of TEAEs reported in post-cataract ME studies (C12-067, C-12-071, C-07-43, 
C-09-003) were local and related to eye disorders. Among the AEs reported (related and unrelated to 
treatment), corneal oedema, dry eye, eye pain, foreign body sensation in eyes, ocular hypertension, 
punctate keratitis, intraocular pressure increased  and visual acuity reduced were the most commonly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016

observed AEs in the Nepafenac 3 mg/ml group with an incidence ≥ 1%. Overall, the rate of ocular TEAEs was 
slightly higher in the Vehicle group, with the exception of corneal erosion, ocular hypertension and vitreous 
haemorrhage that appeared with a higher incidence in the Nepafenac 3 mg/ml group.   
Treatment-related adverse events (adverse drug reactions; ADRs) 
The adverse reactions related to the treatment are listed in the Table below. 
Table 28 Overall frequency and incidence of ADRs in Post cataract ME studies  
The most commonly reported ADRs in the Nepafenac 3 mg/ml group were punctate keratitis (0.7% in 
Nepafenac 3 mg/ml, 1% in vehicle, 2.9% in Nepafenac 1 mg/ml), keratitis (0.3%, 0.3%, 0.0%) and foreign 
body sensation in eyes (0.3%, 0.5%, 0.0%). Dry eye was identified as a new ADR with a rare frequency.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Serious adverse event (SAE) 
No treatment-related SAEs were reported. 
Nepafenac 3 mg/ml (QD) studies 
Among the 27 (4.5%) subjects who experienced treatment emergent serious adverse events in the Nevenac 
3mg/ml treatment group, ocular SAEs were reported for 3 (0.5%) subjects (posterior capsule rupture, 
device dislocation, and eye injury). A total of 24 (4.0%) subjects reported non-ocular SAEs. 
Among the 28 (4.7%) subjects who experienced treatment emergent serious adverse events in Nevanac 
3mg/ml vehicle treatment group, 2 (0.3%) subjects experienced ocular SAEs (VIth nerve paralysis and 
intraocular injection) and 26 (4.4%) subject experienced nonocular SAEs. 
Nepafenac 1 mg/ml (TID) studies 
Overall, 10 (4.8%) subjects experienced treatment emergent serious adverse events in the Nepafenac 1 
mg/mL treatment group. All of these SAEs were nonocular. 
Among the 10 (4.8%) subjects in the Nepafenac 1 mg/ml Vehicle treatment group who experienced 
treatment emergent serious adverse events, 1 (0.5%) subject experienced 1 ocular SAE (posterior capsule 
rupture) and 9 (4.3%) subjects experienced nonocular SAEs.  
•  Deaths 
In Studies C-12-067 and C12-071, 1 subject in the Vehicle group died; additionally, 1 subject in the 
Nepafenac group and 4 subjects in the Vehicle group died. One subject who was never exposed to study 
medication died. 
None of these events were considered by the Investigator to be treatment-related. 
No deaths were reported in the C-07-43 study. One death was reported in the C-09-003 study for a subject 
treated with Nepafenac 1 mg/ml. This subject died after discontinuing from the study and the death was not 
considered by the Investigator to be treatment-related. 
Laboratory findings 
•  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were not conducted during the clinical studies. 
•  Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
During studies C-12-067 and C-12-071 the following parameters were measured: 
- 
- 
Intraocular pressure 
Slit-Lamp Examination: aqueous cells, aqueous flare, corneal oedema, bulbar redness and corneal 
epithelium integrity (fluorescein staining). 
-  Dilated Fundus Exam: peripheral, retina/macula/choroid, optic nerve. 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 38/50 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) was assessed in the study eye for all subjects. The maximum change in IOP for 
each subject was calculated as the maximum absolute change in IOP between baseline and all study visits, 
either scheduled or unscheduled. 
Mean IOP was higher at Visit 2 (the first day after cataract surgery) compared to any other visit for both 
treatment groups. This increase in mean IOP at Visit 2 is not unexpected immediately after cataract surgery 
and was transient as shown by mean IOPs at all post-operative visits. A similar trend was also observed in 
the Vehicle treatment group. A review of the range of IOP changes revealed that most subjects in both 
treatment groups experienced maximum changes in IOP of no more than 10 mmHg. 
No ADRs were reported for changes in IOP among subjects in both treatment groups. 
Slit-Lamp Examination 
A shift in aqueous cell scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at Day 1 was noted for 19 subjects in the 
Nepafenac group and 23 subjects in the Vehicle group. 1 subject in each group had a shift in aqueous cell 
scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at Day 7. No such a shift was observed at any of the other visits 
for either group. 
No subject in the Nepafenac group had a shift in aqueous flare scores from normal at baseline to abnormal 
at any postoperative study visit. 
A shift in corneal oedema scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at Day 1 was noted for 3 subjects in 
the Nepafenac group and 4 subjects in the Vehicle group. No subject in either treatment group had a shift in 
corneal oedema scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at any post-Day 1 study visit. 
Corneal staining 
No more than 9 subjects in any treatment group at any post-baseline study visit had a shift from normal to 
abnormal in corneal staining within any region and there were no trends associated with the shifts (ie., the 
shifts represented minor fluctuations with no obvious pattern). The mean change from baseline in corneal 
staining at Day 90 was approximately 0 within each region for each treatment group. There were no 
meaningful differences in corneal staining scores when evaluated by age category or for the overall 
population. 
Dilated Fundus Parameters 
A shift in peripheral retina scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at Day 90 was noted for 6 subjects in 
the Nepafenac 0.3% group and 5 subjects in the Vehicle group. A shift in macula scores from normal at 
baseline to abnormal at Day 90 was noted for 10 subjects in the Nepafenac 0.3% group and 21 subjects in 
the Vehicle group. A shift in choroid scores from normal at baseline to abnormal at Day 90 was noted for 3 
subjects in the Nepafenac 0.3% group and 1 subject in the Vehicle group. Finally, 1 subject in the Nepafenac 
0.3% group and 2 subjects in the Vehicle group had a shift from normal at baseline to abnormal at Day 90 
in optic nerve scores. There were no meaningful differences in dilated fundus assessments when evaluated 
by age category or in the overall safety population. 
Safety in special populations 
A review of adverse events by age, gender, race and iris colour revealed no clinically relevant differences in 
the types and incidences of adverse events between groups for either Nepafenac 3 mg/mL or Nepafenac 
1 mg/ml. The conclusions based upon a review of adverse events in these subgroups are consistent with 
those drawn from the review of the overall population. Similarly, no relevant differences were observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 39/50 
 
  
  
 
 
when concomitant diseases and concomitant medication were taken into account.  
A review of AEs by onset day revealed that most ocular AEs associated with the use of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL 
eye drops, suspension occurred within 14 days following the first dose of study medication (ie, during the 
immediate postoperative period). 
TEAEs were not evaluated based upon extrinsic factors. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interactions were reported in any clinical study involving Nepafenac 3 mg/ml. Nepafenac 3 mg/ml 
has been safely administered in conjunction with other ophthalmic medications such as antibiotics, 
anesthetics, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, alpha-agonists, cycloplegics, and mydriatics. 
Further, no drug interactions have been reported in association with several concomitant systemic 
medications. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study protocols for both C-12-067 and C12-071 encouraged subjects who discontinued treatment early to 
stay in the studies for follow-up. Those subjects who continued to the study end were not included in the 
population of study discontinuation, even though they had discontinued study medication prematurely. 
Previously conducted studies (C-07-43 and C-09-003) did not have the same follow-up. Therefore, an 
additional analysis was performed to identify subjects who discontinued study medication due to AEs 
regardless whether they stayed to study completion or exited from the study early. 
In Nepafenac 3 mg/ml group, 6 (1.0%) subjects discontinued study medication due to AEs (4 due to eye 
disorders: eye irritation, macular edema, vitreous haemorrhage, vitreous loss and 2 due to injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications: eye injury and eye operation complication), which was lower than in the 
Vehicle group (20 subjects, 3.4%) and in Nepafenac 1 mg/ml group (7 subjects, 3.3%).  
Post marketing experience 
Nepafenac-containing products for ocular use (at concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL) are authorised 
in 105 countries world-wide. From the first marketing authorization (August 2005) up to August 31, 2015, 
41,627,878 units of Nepafenac 1 mg/ml, eye drops, suspension and 1,846,196 units of Nepafenac 3 mg/mL, 
eye drops, suspension have been distributed worldwide. 
The cumulative postmarketing experience is in line with the reference safety information. AEs possibly 
associated with the ocular use of nepafenac are generally non-serious and mostly related to local ocular 
disorders. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety assessment was mainly based on an analysis of the pooled safety data from studies C-12-067 and 
C-12-071. Additionally, a historical comparison between Nepafenac 3 mg/ml QD and Nepafenac 1 mg/ml 
TID post-cataract ME clinical trials results was provided. Given that the study population, the study design, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 40/50 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
the treatment duration and the total daily dose (3 mg/ml) were comparable between the two strengths, this 
indirect comparison was found to be acceptable. 
The safety population in the 4 post-cataract ME studies included 1610 patients. Among them, a total of 594 
patients (301 in C-12-067 study and 293 in C-12-071 study) were exposed to nepafenac 3mg/ml and 209 
patients were previously exposed in studies C-07-43 and C-09-003 to nepafenac 1 mg/ml TID.  
The total treatment duration was 92 days, starting the day before the cataract surgery, 1 additional drop 30 
to 120 minutes prior to the surgery on day of surgery, and during 90 days post-surgery. Around 50% of 
patients in studies 067 and 071 were exposed to Nepafenac 3 mg/ml for 61-90 days and the other 50% were 
exposed for more than 90 days. Based on the data described above, the size of the safety database as well 
as the extent of exposure was considered to be adequate. Even though long-term safety profile is at present 
unknown, this is not a concern given the intended indication. 
Although similar safety results could be expected with both Nepafenac 3 mg/ml QD and Nepafenac 1 mg/ml 
TID administered during 92 days, the differences in the concentration of excipients (especially benzalkonium 
chloride) when the product is administered once daily or three times daily could have an impact on the safety 
profile. The intended posology for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml QD may expose patients to a less daily concentration 
of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) in comparison to the posology established for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml TID, 
which may be an advantage for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml from a safety point of view. 
Indeed, based on the available clinical data, the safety profile established for nepafenac 1 mg/ml TID seems 
to be slightly worse than the one observed for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml. Ocular hypertension was surprisingly 
only reported in the current studies with Nepafenac 3 mg/ml (1% in Nepafenac 3 mg/ml vs. 0.5% in Vehicle 
and 0.0% in Nepafenac 1 mg/ml groups). The MAH has conducted an additional analysis in order to explore 
the risk of ocular hypertension associated to Nepafenac 3 mg/ml treatment. In this analysis,  the related 
term intraocular pressure increased was also included. No meaningful differences were observed with 
respect to vehicle. The difference observed with respect to Nepafenac 1 mg/ml (4.9% vs 2.4% respectively) 
appears to be due to inter-study variation as similar differences in the reporting rates were also observed in 
the Vehicle arms (Nepafenac Vehicle 3 mg/ml 4.5% vs Nepafenac Vehicle 1 mg/ml 1.9%). In any event, 
intraocular pressure increased is mainly associated with the cataract surgery and therefore it was considered 
unrelated to the study drug. 
Punctate keratitis, corneal oedema and intraocular pressure increased were the commonest AEs reported in 
patients using nepafenac 3mg/ml. All of them were associated with the surgical procedure itself. Punctate 
keratitis can be also associated with the ocular administration of NSAIDs and/or BAK use and was already 
listed as an uncommon ADR in the PI of Nevanac. Punctate keratitis and intraocular pressure incidence were 
similar between vehicle and active groups but corneal oedema incidence was higher in the vehicle groups 
compared to the active groups. It was noted that corneal oedema is not unexpected after cataract surgery 
and variables impacting the degree of oedema include grade of nuclear sclerosis, surgical technique, 
surgeon skill, pre-existing condition of the corneal endothelium, and degree of elevated IOP postoperatively.  
The amount of patients reporting ADRs was considered low. Most of these AEs were local ocular AEs. The 
most commonly reported treatment-emergent ADRs in the nepafenac 3 mg/ml group were punctate 
keratitis (0.7% in Nepafenac 3 mg/ml, 1% in vehicle, 2.9% in Nepafenac 1 mg/ml), keratitis (0.3%, 0.3%, 
0.0%) and foreign body sensation in eyes (0.3%, 0.5%, 0.0%). The incidences were comparable to those 
observed in the vehicle group. In the Nepafenac 1 mg/ml group, the incidence of punctate keratitis was 
slightly higher than the one reported for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml, which is likely to be associated with the BAK 
daily concentration. 
The safety profile established for nepafenac 1 mg/ml TID seemed to be slightly worse than the one observed 
for nepafenac 3 mg/ml. However, ocular hypertension was only reported in the new studies with Nepafenac 
3 mg/ml (1% in Nepafenac 3 mg/ml vs. 0.5% in Vehicle and 0.0% in nepafenac 1 mg/ml groups). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 41/50 
 
  
  
Given that Nepafenac 3 mg/ml is applied locally, systemic exposure to nepafenac is expected to be low. The 
most common non-ocular TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (1.2% in nepafenac 3 mg/ml vs. 1.8% in vehicle), 
intraocular pressure increased (3.9% vs. 4.0%) and headache (1.2% vs. 2.3%). Non-ocular ADRs were very 
few (1 patient had headache and 1 patient had vital dye staining cornea present).  
No relevant safety concerns were observed during slit-lamp examinations (aqueous cells, aqueous flare, 
corneal oedema, bulbar redness and corneal epithelium integrity) and dilated fundus exams (peripheral, 
retina/macula/choroid, optic nerve). 
Information related to safety in special population did not highlight any specific concern. 
Data from cumulative post-marketing experience was found to be reassuring. The majority of AEs were 
non-serious and related to eye disorders. Dry eye was identified as a new ADR of rare frequency and added 
to the SmPC section 4.8. No new AE was identified from post-marketing reports.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The size of the safety database as well as the extent of exposure were considered sufficient to characterise 
the safety profile of Nepafenac 3 mg/ml in line with the proposed use in diabetic patients.  
No relevant differences between the safety profile established for Nepafenac 1 mg/ml group TID and the one 
observed for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml were reported, which is not unexpected as the total daily dose will be the 
same in both cases (i.e. 3 mg/ml per day). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 45/50 
 
  
  
 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The main changes to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 are shown below (additions are shown in bold, 
deletions as strike-through): 
SmPC section 4.1  
NEVANAC 3 mg/ml is indicated in adults for: 
- Prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery 
- Reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery in 
diabetic  
patients (see section 5.1) 
SmPC section 4.1  
For the reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema associated with cataract surgery 
in diabetic patients, the dose is 1 drop of NEVANAC in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) 
once daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery and up to 
60 days of the postoperative period as directed by the clinician. An additional drop should be 
administered 30 to 120 minutes prior to surgery. 
SmPC section 4.4 
NEVANAC 3 mg/ml eye drops, suspension should not be used for the reduction in the risk of postoperative 
macular edema associated with cataract surgery as efficacy and safety of this strength for this indication has 
not been studied. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in SmPC and to update the 
annexes in line with the latest QRD template.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
As the application pertains to the addition of a new indication only, the changes to the PIL were limited to 
some new phrases with additional information in sections 1, 3 and 4. As the format of the PIL has not 
changed, the readability is not expected to be affected.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Beneficial effects 
Following administration to diabetic patients with non-proliferative retinopathy after cataract surgery, 
significantly fewer patients receiving Nepafenac 3 mg/ml (2.3% in Study 067 and 5.9% in Study 071) 
developed macular oedema compared to patients receiving Vehicle (17.3% and 14.3%, respectively). The 
macular thickness was substantially less in patients treated with Nepafenac than in patients treated with 
Vehicle (254.1 microns vs 268.2 microns [p < 0.001], in Study 067; 259.7 microns vs 270.0 microns [p= 
0.003], in Study 071) at the end of treatment period. This effect was also shown in the PP analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/167525/2016 
Page 46/50 
 
  
  
 
 
The observed effect of Nepafenac 3 mg/ml translates to 60% and 80% reduction in the odds of developing 
ME relative to vehicle based on C-12-071 analysis and C-12-067 + C-12-071 ad hoc pooled analysis, 
respectively, which was considered to be of clinical relevance. 
A significant difference in the percentage of patients with an increase in BCVA of more than 15 letters was 
observed between groups in study 067 (18.7%; p<0.001). Moreover, a higher percentage of patients 
treated with Nepafenac 3 mg/ml (55.7% in Study 067 and 40.8% in Study 071) than those treated with 
Vehicle (44.3% and 32.4%, respectively) attained a 20/20 or better vision at the end of the study.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Whereas the effect in terms of reduction of the incidence of macular oedema and improvement of visual 
acuity has been clearly established in study 067, only numerical differences have been observed in study 
071.  
The differences between studies have been attributed to the better than expected behaviour of the Vehicle 
arm (reporting an incidence of 14.3% of macular oedema, inferior to those reported in the other Nepafenac 
studies in this indication). This was acknowledged by the CHMP. Demographical or disease related 
characteristics between studies did not provide additional reasons to explain the observed differences.  
All patients in the studies were treated with prednisolone eye drops for 4 weeks post-surgery. Although a 
synergistic effect of NSAIDs and corticosteroid has been suggested in literature (Kim, 2015), doubts 
regarding the benefit of additional use have also been raised (Kim. 2016). Without a control group not 
receiving corticosteroids a definitive conclusion regarding the role of each component of the association 
cannot be undoubtedly reached. 
Two different SD-OCT equipments were used to measure the macular thickness and volume. In principle it 
should not impact on parameters expressed as relative changes (e.g the primary efficacy variable) but it 
might impact on those variables defined as absolute changes (e.g mean thickness of retina). The MAH has 
justified the lack of impact of using two different SD-OCT equipments in the main clinical trials on the final 
outcome by the selection of a single brand of SD-OCT by each investigational centre, the harmonization of 
the grading and procedures carried out by the central reading centre and the fact that the anatomic variables 
(those expressed as percentage of change and the measurements based upon macular volume) were 
relative to baseline. Although the frequency of use of the OCT equipments was different between the two 
studies, the distribution of equipments between treatment groups was balanced. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of AEs reported in the clinical studies was low. The majority of TEAEs reported in all the 
post-cataract ME studies (C12-067, C-12-071, C-07-43, C-09-003) were local and related to eye disorders. 
Corneal oedema, dry eye, eye pain, foreign body sensation in eyes, ocular hypertension, punctate keratitis, 
intraocular pressure increased and visual acuity reduced were the most commonly TEAEs observed in the 
Nepafenac 3 mg/ml group with an incidence ≥ 1%.  
Most of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were local ocular AEs. The most commonly reported 
treatment-emergent ADRs in the nepafenac 3 mg/ml group were punctate keratitis (0.7%), keratitis (0.3%) 
and foreign body sensation in eyes (0.3%). All the ADRs were already reflected in the PI of Nevanac.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The overall incidences of AEs were comparable to those observed in the Vehicle group and in Nepafenac 
1 mg/ml TID.  Some of them, such as corneal oedema and intraocular pressure increased were associated 
with the surgical procedure itself and were not attributed to the treatment with Nevanac.  Punctate keratitis 
is a manifestation of mild epithelial damage and may also occur postoperatively due to the surgical 
procedure.  
Although similar safety results are expected with both Nepafenac 3 mg/ml QD and Nepafenac 1 mg/ml TID, 
the differences in the concentration of excipients (especially benzalkonium chloride) when the product is 
administered once daily or three times daily could theoretically have an impact on the safety profile. The 
intended posology for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml QD may expose patients to a less daily concentration of 
benzalkonium chloride (BAK) in comparison to the posology established for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml TID, which 
may be an advantage for Nepafenac 3 mg/ml from a safety point of view. However, overall, no significant 
differences in the safety profiles of the two strengths have been observed.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Both main studies demonstrated a reduction in the risk of ME occurrence in the Nepafenac 3 mg/ml group 
compared to the Vehicle group. Post hoc analyses from studies C-12-067 and C-12-071 showed that 
reducing the risk of ME occurrence is indeed beneficial for patients in achieving better visual outcomes. 
Patients developing macular oedema, regardless the treatment received achieved poorer results ( lower rate 
of patients with ≥ 15 letters improvement [22.0% in Study 067, 33.9% in Study 071] and higher rate of 
patients with > 5 letters worsening [50.8% and 35.6%, respectively]) than those patients without macular 
edema  (improvement of ≥ 15 letters 55.5% and 51.4% [in Study 067 and Study 071, respectively] and 
worsening of > 5 letters 18.2% and 15.7% [ in Study 067 and Study 071, respectively]. 
Although study 071 has shown only numerical difference between treatment groups, without reaching the 
predefined difference of 13%, additional analyses and historical comparison with studies conducted with 
Nevanac  1mg/mL,  provided  sufficient  reassurance  that  the  benefits  shown  for  Nevanac  3mg/mL  are 
clinically relevant.  
The majority of unfavourable effects were related to eye disorders. Punctate keratitis was the most frequent 
TEAE associated with nepafenac administration, which is not unexpected given that this event is a 
well-known class-effect related to the use of ophthalmic NSAIDs. In addition, punctate keratitis may be 
linked with frequent and continued use of BAK. Some other common AEs (corneal oedema, intraocular 
pressure) were associated with the cataract surgery itself. In general, all the AEs were manageable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the available data, the CHMP concluded that the benefits of Nevanac 3mg/mL QD in the prevention 
of macular oedema following cataract surgery in diabetic patients outweighed its risks. The benefit-risk 
balance was thus considered favourable. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The sought indication is already approved for the lower strength of the same product (Nevanac 1 mg/mL). 
Both strengths can be considered similar in the total daily dose of Nepafenac delivered and there is no reason 
to expect a different response from both formulations. Rather, Nevanac 3 mg/mL represents a reduction of 
the burden of the treatment to the patient as it only requires once daily instillation compared to 3 times daily 
administration for Nevanac 1mg/ml.  
The safety profile of Nepafenac 3 mg/ml QD in the prevention of postoperative macular oedema did not 
seem to differ from that already known for Nepafenac 1 mg/ml TID. No new safety concerns were identified 
for Nepafenac 3mg/ml dosed QD for 90 days postoperatively and overall safety was comparable to its vehicle 
and to Nepafenac 1 mg/ml TID. The potential for harm in terms of serious adverse events was very low with 
Nepafenac 3 mg/ml (none of the SAEs reported in C-12-067 and C-12-071 were assessed as related to study 
treatment). Taking into account the benign safety profile, and the convenience of once a day dosing, the 
CHMP agreed that Nevanac 3mg/mL provides clinically relevant benefits that outweigh the potential risks for 
use in the proposed indication.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

Extension of indication to include the indication ‘reduction in the risk of postoperative macular oedema 
associated with cataract surgery in diabetic patients’ also for the 3 mg/ml strength based on data from the 
phase III studies C-12-067 and C-12-071. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to implement editorial changes in SmPC and to update the annexes in line with the latest 
QRD template. An updated RMP version 8 was agreed during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Hypertension 
Treatment of essential hypertension in adults. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular prevention 
Reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in adults with: 
•  manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral 
arterial disease) or 
type 2 diabetes mellitus with documented target organ damage 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment of essential hypertension 
The usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily. Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 20 mg. 
In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be increased to a 
maximum of 80 mg once daily. Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination with thiazide-type 
diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which have been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering 
effect with telmisartan. When considering raising the dose, it must be borne in mind that the maximum 
antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the start of treatment (see section 5.1). 
Cardiovascular prevention 
The recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan 
are effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity. 
When initiating telmisartan therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity, close monitoring of blood 
pressure is recommended, and if appropriate adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be 
necessary. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment  
Limited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis. 
A lower starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4). No posology adjustment 
is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see 
section 4.4). 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva Pharma in children and adolescents aged below 18 have not 
been established.  
Currently available data are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Method of administration 
Telmisartan tablets are for once-daily oral administration and should be taken with liquid, with or without 
food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) 
Biliary obstructive disorders 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Severe hepatic impairment 
The concomitant use of Telmisartan Teva Pharma with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued angiotensin II 
receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to 
alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When 
pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, 
and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
Hepatic impairment 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or 
severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile. These 
patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan. Telmisartan Teva Pharma should 
be used only with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
Renovascular hypertension 
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal 
artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that 
affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation 
When Telmisartan Teva Pharma is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of 
potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration 
of Telmisartan Teva Pharma in patients with recent kidney transplantation. 
Intravascular hypovolaemia 
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma, may occur in patients 
who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or 
vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
Volume and/or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren 
increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). 
Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy. 
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, 
including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan 
has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see 
section 4.8). 
Primary aldosteronism 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting 
through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not recommended. 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or 
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
Diabetic patients treated with insulin or antidiabetics 
In these patients hypoglycaemia may occur under telmisartan treatment. Therefore, in these patients an 
approptiate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics 
may be required, when indicated. 
Hyperkalaemia 
The use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause 
hyperkalaemia. 
In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with 
other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/or in patients with intercurrent events, 
hyperkalaemia may be fatal. 
Before considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone 
system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated. 
The main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are: 
- 
- 
Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (>70 years) 
Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensinaldosterone 
system and/or potassium supplements. Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products 
that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing 
diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives 
(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim. 
Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, 
worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e.g. infectious diseases), 
cellular lysis (e.g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma). 
- 
Close monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5). 
Ethnic differences 
As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, 
possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population. 
Other 
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic 
cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Excipients 
Sorbitol 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma 20 mg tablets 
This medicine contains 21.4 mg sorbitol in each tablet. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma 40 mg tablets 
This medicine contains 42.8 mg sorbitol in each tablet. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma 80 mg tablets 
This medicine contains 85.6 mg sorbitol in each tablet. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Digoxin 
When telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma concentration 
(49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing 
telmisartan, monitor digoxin levels in order to maintain levels within the therapeutic range. 
As with other medicinal products acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may 
provoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other 
medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-
sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal antiinflammatory 
medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives 
(cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim). 
The occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of the 
above-mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium 
sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium. A combination with ACE 
inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly 
followed. 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements 
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss. Potassium 
sparing diuretics e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or 
potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. If concomitant 
use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent 
monitoring of serum potassium. 
Lithium 
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant 
administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists, including telmisartan. If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum 
lithium levels is recommended. 
Concomitant use requiring caution 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products 
NSAIDs (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective 
NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In some patients with 
compromised renal function (e.g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), 
the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may 
result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually 
reversible. Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients 
should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after 
initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter. 
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the 
AUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. 
Diuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics) 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide 
diuretic) may result in volume depletion, and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with 
telmisartan. 
To be taken into account with concomitant use 
Other antihypertensive agents 
The blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other 
antihypertensive medicinal products. 
Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) through 
the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher 
frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including 
acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may 
potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan: Baclofen, amifostine. 
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, or 
antidepressants. 
Corticosteroïds (systemic route) 
Reduction of the antihypertensive effect. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy 
(see section 4.4). The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and 
third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
There are no adequate data from the use of Telmisartan Teva Pharma in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during 
the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. 
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, 
similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is 
considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive 
treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped 
immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started. 
Exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to 
induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and 
neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should exposure to 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
Because no information is available regarding the use of Telmisartan Teva Pharma during breast-feeding, 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety 
profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
Fertility 
In preclinical studies, no effects of telmisartan on male and female fertility were observed.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
When driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness 
may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy such as Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Serious adverse drug reactions include anaphylactic reaction and angioedema which may occur rarely 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), and acute renal failure. 
The overall incidence of adverse reactions reported with telmisartan was usually comparable to placebo 
(41.4% vs 43.9 %) in controlled trials in patients treated for hypertension. The incidence of adverse reactions 
was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients. The safety profile of 
telmisartan in patients treated for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity was consistent with that obtained 
in hypertensive patients. 
The adverse reactions listed below have been accumulated from controlled clinical trials in patients treated 
for hypertension and from post-marketing reports. The listing also takes into account serious adverse 
reactions and adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported in three clinical long-term studies 
including 21642 patients treated with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity for up to six 
years. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Sepsis 
In the PRoFESS trial, an increased incidence of sepsis was observed with telmisartan compared with 
placebo.  The event may be a chance finding or related to a mechanism currently not known (see section 
5.1). 
Hypotension 
This adverse reaction was reported as common in patients with controlled blood pressure who were treated 
with telmisartan for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity on top of standard care. 
Hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder 
Most cases of hepatic function abnormal / liver disorder from post-marketing experience occurred in 
Japanese patients. Japanese patients are more likely to experience these adverse reactions. 
Interstitial lung disease 
Cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported from post-marketing experience in temporal association 
with the intake of telmisartan. However, a causal relationship has not been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans. 
Symptoms 
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia 
dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported. 
Management 
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis. The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment 
should be symptomatic and supportive. Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of 
the symptoms. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal 
may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored 
frequently. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume 
replacement given quickly. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code: C09CA07. 
Mechanism of action 
Telmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. Telmisartan 
displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is 
responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity 
at the AT1 receptor. Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor. The binding is long-lasting. Telmisartan 
does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors. The 
functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by 
angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan. Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by 
telmisartan. Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels. Telmisartan does not 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin. Therefore it 
is not expected to potentiate bradykininmediated adverse effects. 
In human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure 
increase. The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Treatment of essential hypertension 
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours. 
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and 
is sustained during long-term therapy. 
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before 
the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. This is confirmed by trough to peak 
ratios consistently above 80 % seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical 
studies. There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of baseline systolic blood 
pressure (SBP). In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent. 
In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting 
pulse rate. The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive 
activity has still to be defined. The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents 
representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials 
comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril). 
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values 
over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension. 
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive 
treatments. 
Cardiovascular prevention 
ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) 
compared the effects of telmisartan, ramipril and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril on 
cardiovascular outcomes in 25620 patients aged 55 years or older with a history of coronary artery disease, 
stroke, TIA, peripheral arterial disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ 
damage (e.g. retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, macro- or microalbuminuria), which is a population at 
risk for cardiovascular events. 
Patients were randomized to one of the three following treatment groups: telmisartan 80 mg (n = 8542), 
ramipril 10 mg (n = 8576), or the combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus ramipril 10 mg (n = 8502), and 
followed for a mean observation time of 4.5 years.  
Telmisartan showed a similar effect to ramipril in reducing the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular 
death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The 
incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in the telmisartan (16.7 %) and ramipril (16.5 %) groups. The 
hazard ratio for telmisartan vs. ramipril was 1.01 (97.5 % CI 0.93 - 1.10, p (non-inferiority) = 0.0019 at a 
margin of 1.13). The all-cause mortality rate was 11.6 % and 11.8 % among telmisartan and ramipril treated 
patients, respectively. 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with 
Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) 
have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an angiotensin II receptor blocker. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, 
or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as compared to 
monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant 
for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients 
with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a 
study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, 
cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse 
outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than 
in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, hypotension 
and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 
Telmisartan was found to be similarly effective to ramipril in the pre-specified secondary endpoint of 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.99 (97.5 % CI 0.90 - 1.08), p 
(non-inferiority) = 0.0004], the primary endpoint in the reference study HOPE (The Heart Outcomes 
Prevention Evaluation Study), which had investigated the effect of ramipril vs. placebo.  
TRANSCEND randomized ACE-I intolerant patients with otherwise similar inclusion criteria as 
ONTARGET to telmisartan 80 mg (n=2954) or placebo (n=2972), both given on top of standard care. The 
mean duration of follow up was 4 years and 8 months. No statistically significant difference in the incidence 
of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or 
hospitalization for congestive heart failure) was found [15.7 % in the telmisartan and 17.0 % in the placebo 
groups with a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95 % CI 0.81 - 1.05, p = 0.22)]. There was evidence for a benefit of 
telmisartan compared to placebo in the pre-specified secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke [0.87 (95 % CI 0.76 - 1.00, p = 0.048)]. There was no 
evidence for benefit on cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95 % CI 0.85 - 1.24). 
Cough and angioedema were less frequently reported in patients treated with telmisartan than in patients 
treated with ramipril, whereas hypotension was more frequently reported with telmisartan.  
Combining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone. CV 
mortality and all cause mortality were numerically higher with the combination. In addition, there was a 
significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia, renal failure, hypotension and syncope in the combination 
arm. Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended in this population. 
In the “Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes” (PRoFESS) trial in patients 50 years 
and older, who recently experienced stroke, an increased incidence of sepsis was noted for telmisartan 
compared with placebo, 0.70 % vs. 0.49 % [RR 1.43 (95 % confidence interval 1.00 - 2.06)]; the incidence 
of fatal sepsis cases was increased for patients taking telmisartan (0.33 %) vs. patients taking placebo (0.16 
%) [RR 2.07 (95 % confidence interval 1.14 - 3.76)]. The observed increased occurrence rate of sepsis 
associated with the use of telmisartan may be either a chance finding or related to a mechanism not currently 
known. 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Telmisartan Teva Pharma in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have 
not been established. 
The blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan were assessed in 76 hypertensive, largely 
overweight patients aged 6 to < 18 years (body weight ≥ 20 kg and ≤ 120 kg, mean 74.6 kg), after taking 
telmisartan 1 mg/kg (n = 29 treated) or 2 mg/kg (n = 31 treated) over a four-week treatment period. By 
inclusion the presence of secondary hypertension was not investigated. In some of the investigated patients 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the doses used were higher than those recommended in the treatment of hypertension in the adult population, 
reaching a daily dose comparable to160 mg, which was tested in adults. After adjustment for age group 
effects mean SBP changes from baseline (primary objective) were -14.5 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 
2 mg/kg group, -9.7 (1.7) mm Hg in the telmisartan 1 mg/kg group, and -6.0 (2.4) in the placebo group. The 
adjusted DBP changes from baseline were -8.4 (1.5) mm Hg, -4.5 (1.6) mm Hg and -3.5 (2.1) mm Hg 
respectively. The change was dose dependent. The safety data from this study in patients aged 6 to < 18 
years appeared generally similar to that observed in adults. The safety of long term treatment of telmisartan 
in children and adolescents was not evaluated. 
An increase in eosinophils reported in this patient population has not been recorded in adults. Its clinical 
significance and relevance is unknown. 
These clinical data do not allow to make conclusions on the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in 
hypertensive paediatric population. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Absorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies. The mean absolute bioavailability 
for telmisartan is about 50 %. When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6 % (40 mg dose) to 
approximately 19 % (160 mg dose). By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar 
whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. There is no 
linear relationship between doses and plasma levels. Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase 
disproportionately at doses above 40 mg. 
Distribution 
Telmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (>99.5 %), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. 
The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l. 
Biotransformation 
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound. No pharmacological 
activity has been shown for the conjugate. 
Elimination 
Telmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of 
>20 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose. There is no evidence of clinically 
relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose. Plasma concentrations were higher in 
females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy. 
After oral (and intravenous) administration, telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly 
as unchanged compound. Cumulative urinary excretion is <1 % of dose. Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is 
high (approximately 1,000 ml/min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/min). 
Special Populations 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of two doses of telmisartan were assessed as a secondary objective in hypertensive 
patients (n = 57) aged 6 to < 18 years after taking telmisartan 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg over a four-week treatment 
period. Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state of telmisartan in children 
and adolescents, and investigation of age-related differences. Although the study was too small for a 
meaningful assessment of the pharmacokinetics of children under 12 years of age, the results are generally 
consistent with the findings in adults and confirm the non-linearity of telmisartan, particularly for Cmax. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender 
Differences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold 
higher, respectively, in females compared to males. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was 
observed. However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency 
undergoing dialysis. Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot 
be removed by dialysis. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability 
up to nearly 100 %. The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range 
caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal 
haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in 
normotensive animals. In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed. Gastric mucosal injury 
(erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs. These pharmacologically mediated 
undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation. 
In both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular 
cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance. 
No clear evidence of a teratogenic effect was observed, however at toxic dose levels of telmisartan an effect 
on the postnatal development of the offsprings such as lower body weight and delayed eye opening was 
observed. 
There was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence 
of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Telmisartan Teva Pharma is and what it is used for 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin II is a substance occurring in the body, which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan Teva Pharma blocks this effect of angiotensin II so that the 
blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ 
means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. 
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs,  which could lead sometimes 
to heart attacks, heart or kidney failure, strokes or blindness. There are usually no symptoms of high blood 
pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is 
within the normal range. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults 
who are at risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke 
or have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Telmisartan Teva Pharma  
Do not take Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Telmisartan Teva Pharma in early 
pregnancy – see pregnancy section). 
if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.   
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering 
medicine containing aliskiren. 
- 
- 
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telmisartan Teva 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharma. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or 
illnesses: 
-  
- 
- 
- 
- 
Kidney disease or kidney transplant 
Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) 
Liver disease 
Heart trouble 
Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood 
minerals) 
Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) 
or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (‘water tablets’), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. 
Elevated potassium levels in your blood 
Diabetes 
- 
- 
- 
Talk to your doctor before taking Telmisartan Teva Pharma: 
- 
-  
if you are taking digoxin. 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-
related kidney problems. 
- aliskiren. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) 
in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Telmisartan Teva Pharma”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Telmisartan Teva Pharma is 
not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section). 
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Telmisartan Teva Pharma in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not 
recommended. 
Other medicines and Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some cases 
you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken 
at the same time with Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
•  Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. 
•  Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, 
potassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, 
immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. 
•  Diuretics (‘water tablets’), especially if taken in high doses together with Telmisartan Teva Pharma, 
may lead to excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension). 
• 
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma” and “Warnings and precautions”). 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Digoxin. 
The effect of Telmisartan Teva Pharma may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-
inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat 
high blood pressure. 
If you suffer from a condition called “orthostatic hypotension” (a drop in blood pressure on standing up from 
a sitting or lying position resulting in dizziness or faintness) your condition may worsen if you take 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma in combination with: 
•  Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure 
•  Baclofen (a muscle relaxant) 
•  Amifostine (a protective medicine during radiotherapy for cancer treatment) 
•  Alcohol 
•  Barbiturates (strong sleeping tablets) 
•  Narcotics (strong pain killers) 
•  Antidepressants 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise 
you to stop taking Telmisartan Teva Pharma before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Telmisartan Teva Pharma.  Telmisartan 
Teva Pharma is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months 
pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Telmisartan Teva Pharma is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if 
you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely. 
Driving and using machines 
Some people feel dizzy or tired when taking Telmisartan Teva Pharma.If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive 
or operate machinery. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma contains sorbitol.  
This medicine contains 21.4 mg sorbitol in each tablet. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure.  
The recommended dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same 
time each day. You can take Telmisartan Teva Pharma with or without food. The tablets should be 
swallowed with some water or other non-alcoholic drink.  It is important that you take Telmisartan Teva 
Pharma every day until your doctor tells you otherwise.  If you have the impression that the effect of 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
For treatment of high blood pressure the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma for most patients is 40 mg 
once a day to control your blood pressure over the 24-hour period. Your doctor has recommended a lower 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose of one 20 mg tablet daily.  Alternatively, Telmisartan Teva Pharma may be used in combination with 
diuretics (“water” tablets) such as hydrochlorothiazide which have been shown to have an additive blood 
pressure lowering effect with Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
For reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma is one 80 mg tablet once 
a day. At the beginning of the preventive therapy with Telmisartan Teva Pharma 80 mg, blood pressure 
should be frequently monitored.  
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once a day. 
If you take more Telmisartan Teva Pharma than you should 
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital 
emergency department immediately. 
If you forget to take Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry.  Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before. If you 
do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a double dose to make 
up for forgotten individual doses. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Telmisartan Teva Pharma is and what it is used for 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin II is a substance occurring in the body, which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan Teva Pharma blocks this effect of angiotensin II so that the 
blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ 
means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. 
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs,  which could lead sometimes 
to heart attacks, heart or kidney failure, strokes or blindness. There are usually no symptoms of high blood 
pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is 
within the normal range. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults 
who are at risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke 
or have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
Do not take Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to telmisartan or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Telmisartan Teva Pharma in early 
pregnancy – see pregnancy section). 
if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.   
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering 
medicine containing aliskiren. 
- 
- 
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Telmisartan Teva 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pharma.

if you are taking digoxin. 
- an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-
related kidney problems. 
- aliskiren. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) 
in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Telmisartan Teva Pharma”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant. Telmisartan Teva Pharma is 
not recommended in early pregnancy and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it 
may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).

recommended. 
Other medicines and Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medicines or take other precautions. In some cases 
you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken 
at the same time with Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
•  Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. 
•  Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, 
potassium-sparing diuretics (certain ‘water tablets’), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, 
immunosuppressives (e.g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. 
•  Diuretics (‘water tablets’), especially if taken in high doses together with Telmisartan Teva Pharma, 
may lead to excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension). 
• 
If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma” and “Warnings and precautions”). Digoxin.

The effect of Telmisartan Teva Pharma may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-
inflammatory medicines, e.g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat 
high blood pressure. 
If you suffer from a condition called “orthostatic hypotension” (a drop in blood pressure on standing up from 
a sitting or lying position resulting in dizziness or faintness) your condition may worsen if you take 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma in combination with: 
•  Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure 
•  Baclofen (a muscle relaxant) 
•  Amifostine (a protective medicine during radiotherapy for cancer treatment) 
•  Alcohol 
•  Barbiturates (strong sleeping tablets) 
•  Narcotics (strong pain killers) 
•  Antidepressants 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy

you to stop taking Telmisartan Teva Pharma before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Telmisartan Teva Pharma.  Telmisartan 
Teva Pharma is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months 
pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  Telmisartan Teva Pharma is not 
recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if 
you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.

3. 
How to take Telmisartan Teva Pharma 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure.  
The recommended dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma is one tablet a day. Try to take the tablet at the same

For treatment of high blood pressure, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma for most patients is 40 mg 
once a day to control your blood pressure over the 24-hour period. However, sometimes your doctor may

54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be used in combination with diuretics (“water” tablets) such as hydrochlorothiazide which have been shown 
to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with Telmisartan Teva Pharma. 
For reduction of cardiovascular events, the usual dose of Telmisartan Teva Pharma is one 80 mg tablet once 
a day. At the beginning of the preventive therapy with Telmisartan Teva 80 mg, blood pressure should be 
frequently monitored.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Telmisartan Teva Pharma is and what it is used for 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. 
Angiotensin II is a substance occurring in the body, which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus 
increasing your blood pressure. Telmisartan Teva Pharma blocks this effect of angiotensin II so that the 
blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. ‘Essential’ 
means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition. 
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs,  which could lead sometimes 
to heart attacks, heart or kidney failure, strokes or blindness. There are usually no symptoms of high blood 
pressure before damage occurs. Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is 
within the normal range. 
Telmisartan Teva Pharma is also used to reduce cardiovascular events (i.e. heart attack or stroke) in adults 
who are at risk because they have a reduced or blocked blood supply to the heart or legs, or have had a stroke 
or have high risk diabetes. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk for such events. 
2.

if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with the 
drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.

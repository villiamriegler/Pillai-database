1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant ViiV Healthcare UK Limited submitted on 25 October 2013 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Triumeq,  through  the  centralised 
procedure  falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  3  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 24 May 2012. 
The applicant applied for the following indication “Triumeq is a fixed-dose combination of 
dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine. It is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age who 
are antiretroviral treatment-naïve or are infected with HIV without documented or clinically suspected 
resistance to any of the three antiretroviral agents in Triumeq (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Before initiating treatment with abacavir-containing products, screening for carriage of the HLA-
B*5701 allele should be performed in any HIV-infected patient, irrespective of racial origin. Screening 
is also recommended prior to re-initiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who 
have previously tolerated abacavir (see “Management after an interruption of Triumeq therapy”).  
Abacavir should not be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele, unless no other 
therapeutic option is available in these patients, based on the treatment history and resistance 
testing (see section 4.4 and 4.8)”. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies.  
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0287/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan PIP.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0287/2012 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Around 34 million people are presently living with HIV, including >3 million children under the age of 
15; at present around 2.5 million people are newly infected each year. Worldwide, around 50% of 
these infected are women, which differs from some western world regions where males are still those 
mainly infected. In western/central Europe around 1 million people are infected; in the US around 1.5 
million.  
Antiretroviral therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality and morbidity in treated HIV-infected 
individuals. Indeed, those able to get adequate and continuous treatment might expect normal life 
spans, when adjusting for other medical conditions overrepresented in this population (hepatitis co-
infections, smoking habits etc). 
A substantial number of highly effective agents have already been approved. However, there is still a 
need for new drugs with improved tolerability and safety, with simple dosing regimens (once daily and 
small pill size) and which are less prone for resistance development when adherence is not optimal. 
From a global perspective, such “forgiving” drugs with a high resistance barrier, and which are also 
easy to co-formulate to suitable fixed dose products are in fact still lacking and highly warranted, in 
particular for use in ART roll-out programs in high epidemic areas.   
A once-daily fixed-dose combination (FDC) single tablet regimen (STR) that combines the integrase 
inhibitor (INI) dolutegravir (DTG) with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) abacavir 
sulfate (abacavir, ABC) and lamivudine (3TC) was developed for use in the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
DTG is a novel, potent, low nanomolar inhibitor of HIV integrase that provides the excellent antiviral 
activity and tolerability demonstrated for the INI class, while also offering once-daily dosing without 
the need for pharmacokinetic (PK) boosting.  
Co-formulated ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg is available as a once-daily FDC worldwide.The new STR was 
developed is a FDC of DTG 50 mg + ABC 600 mg + 3TC 300 mg with once-daily dosing for 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve and ART-experienced (INI-naïve) patients, and is referred to as the 
DTG/ABC/3TC FDC.

Active Substance 
Three active substances are used in this fixed combination product, dolutegravir, abacavir and 
lamivudine. 
Dolutegravir  
General information 
The chemical name of dolutegravir sodium salt is: 2H-Pyrido[1',2':4,5] pyrazino[2,1-b] [1,3]oxazine-9-
carboxamide,N-[(2,4-difluorophenyl)methyl]-3,4,6,8,12,12a-hexahydro-7-hydroxy-4-methyl-6,8-
dioxo, sodium salt (1:1), (4R,12aS), and has the following structure: 
Figure 1 – Chemical structure of dolutegravir. 
Dolutegravir sodium is a white to light yellow, non-hygroscopic, crystalline substance; it is slightly 
soluble in water, but practically not soluble over the physiological range. It presents 2 chiral centres 
and polymorphism. The most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form is Form 1. The enantiomeric 
purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and polymorphism is also tested routinely by XRPD. 
The chemical structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR 
spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Dolutegravir sodium is manufactured through 5 main steps using commercially available starting 
materials with acceptable specification; the last step of synthesis is the formation of the salt. The 
process is described in sufficient detail (raw materials, amounts, process conditions and controls) and a 
flow chart has been provided. Dolutegravir sodium anhydrous crystalline substance is milled in order to 
obtain the particle size distribution needed to meet finished product performance requirements.  
The active substance has been developed using a Quality by Design (QbD) approach, in line with ICH 
Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 and other regulatory guidance. However, no Design Space was proposed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests description (visual), identification (IR), sodium 
content (IPC-AES), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), water content (KF), solid state (XRPD), particle size distribution (laser diffraction).  
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was also 
provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. The 
analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data are provided on 3 production batches of the active substance. All the batches were 
manufactured according to the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the 
active ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging 
from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term 
(25°C/60%RH) and intermediate condition (30°C/65%RH) for up 18 months and accelerated 
(40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. The active substance used in the primary stability studies was 
manufactured according to the commercial process.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. 
Data were also presented for short-term storage under stress conditions for one of the three above 
batches. Samples have been stored exposed to high temperature, high humidity and extreme light. 
From the stress studies a slight increase in the total impurities from 0.10 to 0.26% is seen for the 
samples exposed to light and a slight decrease in dolutegravir sodium content at the elevated storage 
conditions but otherwise no changes are observed. 
Forced degradation studies were also performed to identify potential degradation products that might 
be formed in drug substance and drug product and to elucidate the mechanisms of formation. From 
those studies it can be seen that there is an increase in related substances at all conditions but most 
pronounced for drug substance in solution and exposed to acidic and alkaline conditions. These 
impurities have not been observed at significant levels under long-term or accelerated condition. 
All dolutegravir sodium samples stressed in solution and solid state were tested for diastereomer 
content. Only the acid stressed sample was found to contain diastereomer impurity.  
No co-eluting impurities were found under the dolutegravir sodium peak in any stressed sample using 
UV diode array detection when using the current method for drug related impurities; the method is 
therefore considered stability indicating. 
All stability studies results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

Abacavir 
General information 
Abacavir  sulfate  is  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder  and  the  solubility  is  pH  dependent  with 
minimal solubility at basic pH and increased solubility at acid. This active substance is slightly soluble 
in  diethyl  ether  and  ethanol.  Abacavir  exhibits  stereoisomerism  due  to  the  presence  of  two  chiral 
centres  (1S,4R  absolute  configuration).  Enantiomeric  purity  is  controlled  routinely  by  chiral  HPLC. 
Abacavir produced by the proposed active substance supplier is a crystalline form.  Polymorphism has 
not been found, although the active substance is of a crystalline nature.  
The  chemical  name  of  Abacavir  is  [4R-(2-Amino-6-cyclopropylamino-purin-9-yl)-cyclopent-2-en-1S-
yl]-methanol sulfate (2:1)and has the following structure: 
Figure 2: Chemical structure of Abacavir 
The chemical structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet 
spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and MS. The molecular 
formula of this active substance is confirmed by elemental analysis. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Abacavir is manufactured by three different manufacturing processes, which are very similar. In all 
three manufacturing processes the active substance is synthesised in three steps using commercially 
available and well defined starting materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. 
The different routes of synthesis have been described in sufficient detail and it was noted that different 
solvents have been used in the different manufacturing processes. The choice of starting materials is 
justified based on their structure and the number of steps involved. The designation of the starting 
materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been also justified with respect to their impurity 
profiles and the potential for carry-over into the final active substance. Information provided 
adequately describes the three manufacturing processes including reactions conditions, quantities of 
raw materials and yields in the processes.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origins and characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, solvents and 
catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance has been also discussed. The 
impurity profile of the active substances for the three manufactures is identical.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the three processes synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The active substance is packaged in plastic containers lined with anti-static low-density polyethylene 
bags and sealed with plastic ties. The materials in contact with the active substance comply with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description  (visual),  identification  (IR;  chiral-
HPLC),  sulfate  content  (HPLC),  enantiomeric  purity  (chiral  HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph Eur) and residue on ignition (Ph Eur). 
A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Full  method  validation  data  was  also 
provided  for  the  in-house  analytical  methods  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  ICH  Guidelines.  The 
analytical  methods  proposed  are  suitable  to  control  the  quality  of  the  active  substance.  The  impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided on  nine  production  batches  produced  by  each.  All  the  batches  were 
manufactured  according  to  the  proposed  synthetic  routes,  and  the  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the 
active  ingredient  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly.  All  results  are  within  the  specifications  and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  packaged  in  the  intended  commercial 
packaging from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under 
long  term  (30°C/60%RH)  for  up  60  months  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months.  The 
active substance used in the primary stability studies was manufactured according to the commercial 
process.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance (visual), water content (HPLC), impurities content 
(HPLC) and abacavir sulfate content (HPLC). Description of an alternative method for abacavir sulfate 
content and impurities (HPLC) has been provided. The alternative method has been validated with 
respect to specificity, linearity, precision, stability of solution and robustness. The analytical methods 
used for release and were stability indicating. 
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  by  exposing  the  active  substance  solution  to  light,  high 
temperature,  aqueous  hydrolysis,  acid  and  base.  The  major  decomposition  products  were  identified 
under  all  conditions  except  in  water  where  formation  of  an  unidentified  degradation  product  is  also 
significant. 
Photostability  testing  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch  of  the  active 
substance.  The  results  showed  that  there  are  no  significant  changes  for  any  of  the  evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
All  stability  studies  indicate  that  the  active  substance  is  stable  at  controlled  room  temperature.  The 
results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

Lamivudine 
General information 
Lamivudine is a white to off-white solid and soluble in water. This active substance exhibits also 
stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres (1S,4R absolute configuration).  
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific rotation. Lamivudine may exist 
as either of two pseudopolymorphs (Form I or Form II). The manufacturing process of Lamivudine is 
well controlled to manufacture only Form II. 
The  chemical  name  of  Lamivudine  is  (2R-cis)-4-amino-1-(2R-hydroxymethyl-[1,3]oxathiolan-5S-yl)-
1H-pyrimidin-2-one and has the following structure: 
Figure 3: Chemical structure of Lamivudine 
The chemical structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet 
spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, MS and x-ray diffraction. The molecular 
formula of this active substance is confirmed by elemental analysis.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Lamivudine is sourced from two manufacturers and both manufacturers used the same route of 
synthesis.  This active substance is manufactured through a four main steps using commercially 
available and well defined starting materials. The final active substance is purified by 
crystallisation.Enantiomeric purity and polymorphism is well controlled during the manufacturing 
process. The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been 
justified with respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for carry-over into the final active 
substance, their structural complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final intermediate and 
the active substance, respectively. Information provided adequately describes the manufacturing 
including reactions conditions, quantities of raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origins and characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, solvents and 
catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance has been also discussed. The 
impurity profile of the active substances for both manufactures is identical. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

solution (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur) and sulphated ash (Ph Eur). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was also 
provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. The 
analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data are provided on six production batches produced by one manufacture and three 
production batches produced by the second manufacturer. All the batches were manufactured 
according to the proposed synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient 
can be manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to 
batch. 
Stability 
Six  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance packaged  in  the  intended  commercial  packaging 
from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term 
(30°C/65%RH)  for  up  60  months  and  three  production  scale  batches  under    accelerated 
(40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6  months.  The  active  substance  used  in  the  primary  stability  studies  was 
manufactured according to the commercial process.

hydrolysis, heat, oxidation and photolysis). No decrease on lamivudine content or increase of 
impurities was observed at solid state stress conditions.  
Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch of the active 
substance. The results showed that there are no significant changes for any of the evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
All stability studies results indicate that the active substance is stable at controlled room temperature. 
The results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.1.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development

The particle size of dolutegravir sodium as well as the granulate is the same as used in support of the 
MA containing Dolutegravir 50 mg tablets. As part of the manufacturing process development studies it 
was demonstrated that particle size of dolutegravir had no practical impact on the manufacturing 
process or product performance. Particle size is not considered to be a critical quality attributes for 
dolutegravir sodium. 
Development studies showed no impact of particle size on the drug product manufacturing process and 
performance as would be expected for a highly soluble molecule. 
Development studies showed no impact of particle size on the drug product manufacturing process and 
performance as would be expected for a highly soluble molecule.  
The excipients were selected based on the commercial formulation of the fixed-dose combination 
abacavir/lamivudine tablets and the monocomponent dolutegravir 50 mg tablets. A risk assessment by 
Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) showed no excipient attributes with a strong relationship to 
any product critical quality attributes. No additional controls beyond those listed in the European 
Pharmacopoeia are required. Compatibility of the active substances with the excipients was confirmed 
by the results of the forced degradation studies on the finished and the results of the formal stability 
studies.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. All information regarding the choice of the active substance and 
the excipients are sufficiently justified. 
For the development of the drug product and development of the manufacturing process a Quality by 
Design (QbD) approach was followed, including the determination of a Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP), Critical Quality Attributes (CQA’s), Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and material attributes 
by a risk assessment and the control strategy. Design of Experiments (DoE) studies and process 
stretching studies were performed to evaluate the significance of changing process parameters on the 
quality and performance of the finished product. It is important to underline that no design space has 
been established or claimed. The critical quality attributes identified were description, identity, content, 
uniformity of content, drug-related impurities and dissolution.   
The development of the medicinal product was based on prior knowledge of the fixed-dose combination 
abacavir/lamivudine tablets and the recently developed monocomponent dolutegravir 50 mg tablets. 
The pharmaceutical formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use 
of risk assessment and design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and 
critical process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis 
(FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an 
influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior 
knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The critical process 
parameters have been adequately identified. 
The pivotal bioequivalence (BE) study has been performed comparing the finished product according to 
its finalised formulation with co-administration of one dolutegravir 50 mg tablet and one tablet 
containing 600 mg/300 mg abacavir/lamivudine administered concurrently under fasted conditions. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is described as stated in the SmPC. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of nine main steps: wet granulation, wet milling, drying, dry 
milling, post-mill blending, blending, lubricant blending, compression, film-coating and packaging. The 
process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form.  
The validation of the manufacturing process has been evaluated on eleven consecutive production 
scale batches. The quality of the production batches was evaluated through the results of in process 
testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The process validation is supported by batch 
data on three production scale batches.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  type  of  dosage  form: 
description, identification (HPLC and UV), uniformity of dosage Units (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC), dissolution (Ph Eur) and microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of five production scale batches of the finished product are provided. The results 
confirm the consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with the 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of six production scale batches for of finished product stored under long term conditions 
for 18 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 
75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The parameters tested are appearance, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph Eur), 
microbiological quality (Ph Eur) and water content (Ph Eur). The analytical methods used during the 
stability studies are the same as used for release testing of the finished product with the exception of 
microbial limits, water activity determination, water content by KF and determination of dolutegravir 
free-acid content. A description of these methods has been provided, validated and they were stability 
indicating. 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. In addition stress stability studies were performed on one fully 
representative batch under various extreme conditions including, humidity, UV-visible light, high 
temperature, aqueous hydrolysis, acid and base conditions. One production scale batch packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing was stored for 30 days and 90 days respectively at 
25°C/60% RH after removal of the induction seal and re-placing the cap.  A patient use study was also 
performed using three 30 count stability batches stored at 30 ºC / 75% RH for 30 days with and 
without desiccant.  Based on the results of stress stability studies and in-use stability, it was concluded 
that the finished product might be slightly affected by the humidity. Therefore, it was decided to add 
the following warning in the PI: “Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture. Keep 
the bottle tightly closed. Do not remove the desiccant”. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable.

2.2.2.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The main goal of the drug development was to develop a 
pharmaceutical form combining the currently approved doses of dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine 
into a single film-coated tablet to be administered once daily in order to support patient adherence to 
treatment. The development of the product includes elements of Quality by Design (QbD), but no 
design space has been established or claimed. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with 
suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated at full scale at the 
proposed manufacturing site and a validation protocol has been presented.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.3.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.4.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant applied for registration of Triumeq film-coated tablets, a fixed dose combination (FDC) 
product containing dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine. No new studies were performed with the 
combination dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine. Characteristics of the separate components are 
summarised. Of note the single components of the FDC have been extensively evaluated, therefore the 
current evaluation is focussed on the necessity to perform additional studies with the combination. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Abacavir 
Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue with reverse transcriptase inhibition activity. It is converted by 
cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of 
deoxyguanosine-t’-triphosphate (dGTP). Antiviral efficacy has been assessed in primary cell cultures 
(mononuclear cells, macrophages) and in cell lines that are susceptible to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Tested

viruses included T-cell line adapted viruses and primary isolates. These in vitro studies in experimental 
models included combinations with ZDV, ddI, ddC, amprenavir and nevirapine. A significant antiviral 
effect of abacavir in HIV-1 and HIV-2 was supported but the combination studies were not performed 
with primary isolates. Mutations associated with abacavir resistance selected during in vitro passage 
were K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V. 
Dolutegravir 
Dolutegravir is referred to as a second generation integrase inhibitor, with activity against raltegravir 
resistant viruses. The mode of action seems well established involving inhibition of viral integration by 
inhibition of integrase strand transfer. Data indicate that dolutegravir enjoys tighter binding and a 
longer dissociative half-life from integrase than either raltegravir or evitegravir possibly reflected in a 
higher barrier for resistance. The IC50 of dolutegravir against the purified enzyme HIV-1 integrase 
ranged from 2.7 nM to 12.6 nM. Corresponding values using cell based assays ranged from 0.51 to 
0.71 nM. This x5 to x10 fold difference in IC50 values between purified enzyme and cell based assays 
could be interpreted as virus replication being inhibited at concentrations lower than the biochemical 
data for the proposed mechanism, but differences in protein binding may influence data.  
With respect to activity against other viruses, IC50 values of 11.2 µM were reported for hepatitis C 
virus also indicating a potential for suboptimal clinical activity at maximum reported clinical plasma 
levels of approximately 3.7-4.2 µg/ml. The TC50 was 96.7 µM, indicating mild cytotoxicity. The IC50 
against measles was 30.3 µM reflecting some antiviral activity.  
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue. After intracellular uptake, it is sequentially 
phosphorylated by host cell intracellular kinases to its respective 5’-triphosophates (TP). Thereafter, 
the monophosphate compound is inserted into the DNA transcript by the viral enzyme reverse 
transcriptase (RT). However, due to lack of a 3’-OH group, the nucleic acid strand extension is 
terminated. Lamivudine is also a competitive inhibitor of the viral RT. Lamivudine inhibited viral 
replication of several laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in different monocyte 
or lymphocyte cell lines or fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The IC50 ranged from 2nM to 
15 μM. In addition, lamivudine-TP inhibited viral RT with a Ki value of 10-12 μM. The in vitro 
intracellular half-life of lamivudine TP was 10-15 h. Antiviral effects have been demonstrated at 
extracellular concentrations of 10 nM. Lamivudine had no activity against a number of other pathogens 
[RNA and DNA viruses (except hepatitis) bacteria and fungi] normally occurring during HIV disease, 
indicating anti-HIV specificity.  
HIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the 
active site of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). This variant arises both in vitro and in HIV-1 infected 
patients treated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy. M184V mutants display greatly 
reduced susceptibility to lamivudine and show diminished viral replicative capacity in vitro. Cross-
resistance conferred by the M184V RT is limited within the nucleoside inhibitor class of antiretroviral 
agents. Zidovudine and stavudine maintain their antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-resistant 
HIV-1. Abacavir maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 harbouring 
only the M184V mutation. The M184V RT mutant shows a <4-fold decrease in susceptibility to 
didanosine and zalcitabine; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Abacavir 
The effect of abacavir at the following receptors was assessed in isolated tissue preparations: 
cholinergic (guinea-pig ileum), adrenergic (rabbit aorta, guinea-pig atria and trachea), histaminergic 
(guinea-pig atria) and serotonergic (rat fundus). In addition, the ability of abacavir to affect tissue 
responsiveness to arachidonic acid (rat fundus), bradykinin (guinea-pig ileum) and angiotensin II 
(rabbit aorta) was determined. There were no direct effects of abacavir on any of the isolated tissue 
preparations, and no significant effects on contractile responses to any of the substances studied. 
Dolutegravir 
Dolutegravir up to 10 µM was evaluated in vitro for off target effects in a selectivity profile screen 
including various receptors, ion channels and enzymes. A 64% inhibition was recorded in the 
melanocortin receptor binding assay. The significance of this receptor has not been fully characterized, 
but a particularly high expression is reported in brain and it appears to play a role in energy 
homeostasis. In studies using isolated tissues no statistically significant effects of dolutegravir were 
noted, but a 41% inhibition was recorded in the sodium channel site 2 rat brain assay. Dolutegravir 
does not appear to have been tested for potential inhibitory activities against DNA topoisomerase I and 
II that are involved in DNA replication, recombination and transcription. 
Lamivudine 
Cytotoxicity was investigated using different in vitro cell systems (e.g. human erythroid precursors, 
human bone marrow progenitor cells). LC50 (concentration reducing cell viability by 50%) was >30 
μM. Depending on the test systems used, the therapeutic index (i.e. the ratio between LC50 and IC50) 
was in general large. No data are available regarding receptor screen with lamivudine. 
Safety pharmacology  
Abacavir 
A range of in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies showed no adverse effects of abacavir on 
central and autonomic nervous system, or respiratory and cardiovascular systems, at doses exceeding 
the maximum proposed therapeutic dose 300 mg (base) bid, equivalent to 12 mg (base)/kg/day based 
on a 50 kg person. These studies involved mouse, rat and dog. 
Dolutegravir 
Results from safety pharmacology studies indicated that single oral doses of dolutegravir up to 500 
(rat) and 1000 (monkey) mg/kg have a low likelihood to induce acute effects on major organ function 
in brain, respiratory and cardiovascular system. Although the maximum concentration of dolutegravir 
tested in the hERG assay was rather low (20 µM) this was justified based on limitations due to use of 
the solvent DMSO. In addition, evaluation of cardiovascular parameters incorporated in repeated dose 
toxicity studies did not suggest any particular cardiovascular adverse effects. In view of results from 
toxicology studies it would have been of interest to determine any potential acute effects on the 
gastrointestinal system, however, considerable clinical safety data is now available that may allow 
relevant conclusions on the potential for gastrointestinal toxicity. 
Lamivudine 
Safety pharmacology studies with lamivudine showed no major effects on cardiovascular or respiratory 
parameters or on intestinal transport.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Abacavir 
Published data have reported on an in vitro synergy of amprenavir and abacavir. 
Dolutegravir 
No non-clinical interaction studies were performed. 
Lamivudine 
The extent of lamivudine triphosphorylation was not impaired by the presence of zidovudine 
concentrations of 5 to 50 μM. Effects of lamivudine on zidovudine triphosphorylation have not been 
reported. In vitro studies of lamivudine given in combination with other antimicrobial agents showed 
that ganciclovir reduced the antiviral activity (IC50) of lamivudine by a factor of 2-3, which is within 
experimental variation. 
Combination abacavir + dolutegravir + lamivudine 
No non-clinical studies with the combination were performed.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Triumeq contains dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine, therefore any interactions identified for these 
drugs individually are relevant for Triumeq. The Applicant concludes that due to different routes of 
metabolism and elimination, and the minimal effect of these agents on drug metabolizing enzymes or 
transporters, no clinically significant drug interactions are expected between dolutegravir, abacavir and 
lamivudine. 
Methods of analysis 
Abacavir 
Plasma abacavir concentrations were measured by methods based on protein precipitation with 
trichloroacetic acid, then chromatographic analysis by reverse phase HPLC with UV detection. The 
lower limit of quantification (LLQ) ranged between 50 and 70 ng/mL, depending on study 
requirements. Analysis methods were validated across the calibration range with respect to specificity, 
accuracy, precision, and stability under a variety of conditions. The methods and limits of quantification 
were adequate with regard to specificity and sensitivity to support the kinetic analyses of abacavir. 
Determination of the radioactivity in in vitro or in vivo biological samples following administration of 
[14C]-abacavir was carried out by either direct liquid scintillation counting (LSC) or by LSC following 
combustion of the sample. For radioactivity concentrations in tissues, quantitative whole body 
autoradiography was used. 
The metabolic profiling of abacavir was conducted by using chromatographic separation with 
radiometric detection and identification of metabolites performed by using LC-MSn. 
Immunoblotting experiments for metabolic bioactivation assessments were carried out following 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of exhaustively extracted protein samples, using anti-abacavir 
antibodies as probes. The antibodies were raised in rabbits against abacavir conjugated to keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin.

Dolutegravir 
Plasma dolutegravir concentrations were measured by methods based on protein precipitation followed 
by chiral or achiral liquid chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) 
detection. The lower limit of quantification (LLQ) ranged between 4.75 and 500 ng/mL, depending on 
study requirements. The chiral and achiral methods used for analysis were validated across the 
calibration range with respect to specificity, recovery, accuracy, precision and stability under a variety 
of conditions. The methods and limits of quantification were adequate with regard to specificity and 
sensitivity to support the kinetic analyses of dolutegravir. 
Determination of the radioactivity in in vitro or in vivo biological samples following administration of 
[14C]-dolutegravir was carried out by either direct liquid scintillation counting (LSC) or by LSC following 
combustion of the sample. For radioactivity concentrations in tissues, quantitative whole body 
autoradiography was used. 
The metabolic profiling of dolutegravir was conducted by using chromatographic separation with 
radiometric detection and identification of metabolites performed by using LC-MSn; nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) methods were used to confirm structures not confirmed by mass spectrometric 
methods. 
Lamivudine 
Plasma lamivudine concentrations were measured by methods based on protein precipitation with 
trichloroacetic acid, then chromatographic analysis by reverse phase HPLC with UV detection. The 
lower limit of quantification (LLQ) ranged between 5 and 100 ng/mL, depending on study 
requirements. The methods and limits of quantification were sufficiently adequate with regard to 
specificity and sensitivity to support the kinetic analyses of lamivudine. 
Determination of the radioactivity in in vitro and in vivo biological samples following administration of 
[3H]-lamivudine was carried out by either direct LSC or by LSC following combustion of the sample. For 
radioactivity concentrations in tissues, quantitative whole body autoradiography was used. 
The metabolic profiling of lamivudine was conducted by using chromatographic separation with 
radiometric detection and identification of metabolites performed by using LC-MSn; nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) methods were used to confirm structures not confirmed by mass spectrometric 
methods. 
Absorption  
Abacavir 
The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been investigated in mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey after 
single IV or single and repeated oral administration. 
Kinetics after IV administration 
Following single intravenous administration of abacavir (10 and 55 mg/kg) to mice (studies 
TEIN/94/0004 and TEIN/94/0005), the elimination half-life was 0.27-0.78 hour. The volume of 
distribution (Vd) was 0.9-1.3 L/kg, indicating equilibrium of abacavir with total body water. The AUC0-∞ 
was 13 µM × h at the 10 mg/kg dose and 103 µM × h at the 55 mg/kg dose. A lower total body 
clearance rate (CL) was observed at the 55 mg/kg dose (1.9 L/h/kg) compared to the 10 mg/kg dose 
(2.7 L/h/kg), leading to a more than dose proportional increase in the AUC. 
Following single IV bolus dose of abacavir (10 or 25 mg/kg) to Cynomolgus monkeys (study 
TEIN/94/0015), AUC0-∞ values were 41 µM × h at 10 mg/kg and 129 µM × h at 25 mg/kg. Thus, the 
AUC increased more than dose proportional. The elimination half-life was 1.3 hours and the volume of 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 19/114 
 
  
  
distribution was 1.1-1.2 L/kg. The total body clearance was slightly faster at 10 mg/kg (0.87 L/h/kg) 
compared to 25 mg/kg (0.71 L/h/kg). 
Kinetics after oral administration 
In mice, the bioavailability of abacavir was 92% at a dose of 10 mg/kg and 76% at a dose of 55 mg/kg 
after single oral dosing (study TEIN/94/0004). Tmax was 0.17 hour and Cmax values of 15 µM (10 
mg/kg dose) and 52 µM (55 mg/kg dose) were observed. AUC0-∞ was 12.2 µM × h at a dose of 10 
mg/kg and 78.5 µM × h at a dose of 55 mg/kg. Based on a repeated dose studies, Cmax and AUC 
increased less than dose proportional. The bioavailability of abacavir was high (76 to 77%) at both 10 
and 25 mg/kg in Cynomolgus monkeys received a single oral dose of abacavir (study TEIN/94/0015). 
Cmax values of 15 µM at 10 mg/kg and 29 µM at 25 mg/kg occurred 1.5 and 2.0 hours after dosing, 
respectively. The t½ was 1.2 hours. There were no statistically significant differences in dose 
normalised AUC0-∞ and Cmax following single oral administration of the succinate and hemisulphate 
salts of abacavir (study RD1997/01258). There were no differences in the values for t½, Tmax and 
mean residence time (MRT) between the salt forms. 
Systemic exposure to abacavir following repeat dosing was investigated in mice receiving oral doses of 
abacavir (195, 312, 496 or 793 mg/kg/day) twice daily with a 6 hour interval for 3 days (study 
TTDR/92/0036). The AUC0-4h for abacavir increased with increasing dose at Day 2. The AUC0-4h for the 
carboxylate metabolite was approximately 20% of that for abacavir and the AUC0-4h for the 
glucuronide increased from 25 to 42% of that for abacavir as the dosage increased at Day 2. In 
another study, mice were administered abacavir (496, 694 or 793 mg/kg/day) twice daily with a 6 
hour interval for 21 days (study TTDR/92/0035). No significant differences were apparent in the 
plasma concentrations of abacavir between different dose levels, except for possibly higher 
concentrations on Day 21 than Day 2 in animals dosed with 793 mg/kg/day. During a 30 day repeat 
oral dose study in which mice received abacavir (78, 234 or 708 mg/kg/day) twice daily with a 6 hour 
interval between doses (study TTEP/94/0006), systemic exposure was significantly higher on Day 30 
than on Day 5. In contrast, AUC0-6h values were significantly lower on Day 91 compared to Day 2 in a 
3 month repeat oral dose study in which mice received abacavir twice daily with a 6 hour interval 
between doses at dose levels of 78, 234 or 708 mg/kg/day (study TTEP/94/0035). Also in a 6 month 
repeat oral dose study in which mice received abacavir twice daily with a 6 hour interval at dosages of 
39, 788 and 234 mg/kg/day (study RD1996/00245), AUC0-24h values were lower on Day 180 than Day 
2 at 234 mg/kg/day but was similar on Days 2 and 180 at lower doses. 
The kinetics of abacavir were investigated in rats during a 30 day repeat dose oral range finding study 
in which abacavir (100, 200 or 400 mg/kg/day) was administered twice daily with a 6 hour interval for 
30 days (study TEZA/91/0025). Plasma concentrations of abacavir increased proportionally with 
increasing dose and were 50 to 90% higher on Day 24 than on Day 2. No gender-related differences in 
plasma concentrations were observed. In a 90 day repeat dose oral study, rats received abacavir twice 
daily with a 6 hour interval at a dose of 25, 96 and 375 mg/kg/day (study RD1997/03595). The 
AUC0-24h appeared dose-proportional except for 35 and 530 mg/kg/day in females on Day 3, and was 
higher in males compared to females on Days 3 and 90. The Cmax was less than dose-proportional. 
Furthermore, the kinetics of abacavir (35, 135 and 530 mg/kg/day) in rats was determined during a 
1-month study (study RD1997/04062). Plasma levels increased with increasing dose, generally less 
than proportionally on Day 1 but proportionally on Day 28. There were no gender-related differences in 
plasma concentrations of abacavir. The kinetics of abacavir (64, 194 or 648 mg/kg/day) were also 
determined in pregnant rats following oral administration twice daily with a 6 hour interval from Days 6 
to 17 of pregnancy (study RD1997/01057). Cmax increased less than dose-proportional. Values for 
AUC0-24h generally increased proportional to increasing dose.

In pregnant rabbits, kinetic data have been obtained following oral administration of abacavir (81, 227 
or 453 mg/kg/day) twice daily with a 6 hour interval from Days 6 to 20 of pregnancy during 
reproductive toxicity studies (study RD1997/01059). Systemic exposure to abacavir was demonstrated 
at each dose level. Cmax increased dose-proportional and AUC0-24h increased dose-proportional. 
During a dose range finding study, Cynomolgus monkeys received abacavir by oral administration 
twice daily with a 6 hour interval at a dosage of 354 mg/kg/day for 10.5 days (study TTDR/93/0001). 
Pre-dose plasma levels of abacavir (16 hours after the previous dose) were high on Day 2 but lower on 
Day 10. Peak plasma levels were generally higher in females than males, due to the greater production 
of the 5’-glucuronide by males than females. Plasma concentrations of abacavir were lower on Day 10 
than Day 2. In contrast the 5’-glucuronide metabolite and 1459U89 (major metabolite) were 
approximately ~2.5-fold and ~3-fold higher on Day 10 than Day 2. Following, repeated oral dosing 
twice daily with a 6 hour interval for 30 days with 100 and 200 mg/kg/day (study TEZA/91/0073), 
mean plasma concentrations of abacavir increased dose-proportional. There were no significant 
differences in concentrations between Days 3 and 29. In a 28 day study, Cynomolgus monkeys 
received orally administered abacavir twice daily with a 6 hour interval at dosages of 35, 99 and 
297 mg/kg/day (study TTEP/94/0007). On Day 26, C max and AUC0-4h were lower than on Day 3. Tmax 
appeared to be longer on Day 26. In a 3-month study in which Cynomolgus monkeys received abacavir 
(35, 99, and 297 mg/kg/day) by oral administration twice daily with a 6 hour interval (study 
TTEP/94/0047). At 297 mg/kg/day, Cmax and AUC0-8h values were lower on Day 87 than on Day 3, 
although there were no apparent differences at lower dosages. In a 12-month study in which 
Cynomolgus monkeys received abacavir (35, 99 and 212 mg/kg/day) by oral administration twice daily 
with a 6 hour interval, no evidence of accumulation of abacavir following multiple oral dosing was 
observed. 
Kinetics in juvenile rats 
The kinetics of abacavir following repeated oral administration were determined in juvenile rats in a 
1-month preliminary study and a 2-month toxicity study. In the preliminary study, abacavir (50, 150 
and 450 mg/kg/day) was administered twice daily with a 6 hour interval, for 31 days starting from Day 
3 of lactation (study RD1998/00110). In the 2-month study, abacavir (40, 120 and 360 mg/kg/day) 
was administered twice daily with a 6 hour interval, for 60 days starting from Day 3 of lactation (study 
RD1997/04060). In the 1-month and 2-month studies, plasma concentrations increased proportionally 
with increasing dose and were 1.5 to 3 times greater on Day 10 than on Day 34/63. There were no 
sex-related differences in systemic exposure to abacavir. Plasma concentrations from the 2-month 
study were comparable to plasma concentrations observed for abacavir following dosing for 1 month in 
adult rats. 
Dolutegravir 
Studies investigating the absorption and pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir after single IV and oral 
administration have been performed in rat, dog and monkey and after repeated oral administration in 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. 
Kinetics after IV administration 
Following intravenous administration of dolutegravir (1 mg/kg) to rats, the clearance 
(0.229 mL/min/kg) and volume of distribution (103 mL/kg) were low, with a half-life of 6.2 hours 
(study RH2007/00101). Following intravenous administration of dolutegravir (1 mg/kg) to non-fasted 
male beagle dogs, the clearance (2.2 mL/min/kg) and volume of distribution (352 mL/kg) were low, 
with a half-life of 5.2 hours (study RH2007/00102). Following intravenous administration of 
dolutegravir (1 mg/kg) to Cynomolgus monkeys, the clearance (2.1 mL/min/kg) and volume of 
distribution (279 mL/kg) were low, with a half-life of 6.0 hours (study RH2007/00103).

Kinetics after oral administration 
In fasted rat, the oral bioavailability of dolutegravir solution (5 mg/kg) was 76% (study 
RH2007/00101). The bioavailability of a suspension of dolutegravir (5 mg/kg) was 34% in non-fasted 
rats and 52% in fasted rats. In fasted rats, the oral bioavailability after capsule administration of 
dolutegravir sodium (~7.3 mg/kg) and free acid dolutegravir (~7.8 mg/kg) was 48% and 35%, 
respectively. The systemic exposure after oral administration of dolutegravir in suspension increased 
less than dose proportional with dose from 50 to 500 mg/kg. In non-fasted beagle dogs, a 
bioavailability of 39% was observed after oral administration of dolutegravir (5 mg/kg) (study 
RH2007/00102). Plasma exposure increased less than dose proportional with increasing dose 
(30-500 mg/kg) in dog (study RD2009/00963). In rabbit dosed with 30, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg 
dolutegravir (study RD2008/01760), Cmax values increased less than dose-proportionally between 30 
and 300 mg/kg while Cmax at 1000 mg/kg was approximately the same as at 300 mg/kg. Mean AUC0-24 
values increased dose-proportionally between 30 and 300 mg/kg while those values at 1000 mg/kg 
were approximately the same as at 300 mg/kg. In fasted Cynomolgus monkeys, the bioavailability was 
87% following oral administration of free acid dolutegravir (5 mg/kg) (study RH2007/00103). 
Following oral administration of dolutegravir sodium (5 mg/kg) to non-fasted Cynomolgus monkeys, 
the bioavailability was 25%. After single oral administration of 1, 3, 10 and 50 mg/kg, the systemic 
exposure to dolutegravir was dose-proportional (study RD2008/01762). No dose relationship was 
noted in the exposure values after oral administration of 50 to 500 mg/kg; the systemic exposure was 
considered to have attained the steady state at 125 mg/kg. Overall, the bioavailability results suggest 
that the absorption of free acid dolutegravir could be limited by the solubility and dissolution rate. 
After repeated dosing with dolutegravir (10-1500 mg/kg/day) in mice, no evidence of accumulation 
was observed after 14 days, 13 weeks and 104 weeks (studies RD2009/01546, RD2009/00028 and 
2012N152419). In rat, no accumulation was observed after repeated oral dosing with dolutegravir 
(2-1000 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, 4 weeks, 26 weeks and 104 weeks (studies RD2007/01140, 
RD2008/01628, RD2009/00410 and 2012N152418). In non-pregnant and pregnant rabbits orally 
dosed with dolutegravir (30-1000 mg/kg), no obvious effects of repeat dosing on the systemic 
exposure values were observed (studies RD2008/01760 and XD2009/0366). After repeated dosing 
with dolutegravir (25-1000 mg/kg/day), no accumulation was observed after 14 days, 4 weeks in 
Cynomolgus monkeys (study RD2007/01142, RD2008/00107). In a 38 week study, accumulation was 
observed after repeated oral dosing with dolutegravir (3-30 mg/kg/day) at Day 120 in female 
monkeys, but not in male monkeys. In addition, no accumulation was observed at Day 270 compared 
to Day 1 (study RD2009/00036/01). 
Kinetics in juvenile rats 
Juvenile rats were given oral doses of dolutegravir (5, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) from Days 4 
to 21 post-partum (study CD2009/00409) or dolutegravir (2, 25, 75 and 300 mg/kg/day) from Days 4 
to 31 post-partum (study CD2009/00770). The systemic exposure increased much less than dose 
proportional. Systemic exposure following 300 mg/kg/day was essentially not different from that 
following 75 mg/kg/day in either sex. In another study, juvenile rats were dosed orally with 
dolutegravir (0.5, 2 and 75 mg/kg/day) from Days 4 to 66 post-partum (study CD2010/00023). The 
systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24) to dolutegravir was generally lower on Day 32 compared to that 
on Day 13. 
Lamivudine 
Site of absorption 
In order to investigate the site of absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, anaesthetised, laparotomised 
rats were prepared with in situ loops of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum (study 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 22/114 
 
  
  
NME/96/019). A solution of [3H]-lamivudine (2 mg/kg) was injected into each loop. Following injection 
each loop was restored to its original location in the abdominal cavity and the animal was sutured. 
Lamivudine showed absorption of approximately 50 to 85% of the dose within 2 hours from the small 
intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) which is consistent with the known pharmacokinetic properties 
of lamivudine. Little absorption (4 to 5% of the dose) from the stomach was observed. 
Kinetics after IV administration 
Following IV administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg) to rat (studies GDM/91/015 and 
GDM/91/077), there was close agreement between serum concentrations of lamivudine and radiolabel, 
indicating that any metabolites produced are cleared rapidly. Clearance was 4 mL/min and the volume 
of distribution was 540 mL, suggesting that the distribution of lamivudine was greater than could be 
attributed to distribution in total body water. Renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 
3.3 mL/min. This value is higher than the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that tubular secretion 
plays a significant role in the clearance of lamivudine. No gender differences were observed. Following 
IV administration of lamivudine at 2000 mg/kg to rat (study GDM/91/021), clearance was 2.0 mL/min 
which suggests a non-linear relationship between clearance and dose. The apparent volume of 
distribution was approximately 1070 mL, suggesting that lamivudine was distributed extra-vascular. 
The elimination half-life was 1.5 at a dose of 45 mg/kg and 6.5 hours at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. 
In addition, the kinetics of lamivudine (30 mg/kg) following IV administration have been studied in 
dogs (studies GDM/91/008 and GDM/91/080). The elimination half-life was 1.7 hours, and when 
compared with plasma radioactivity levels, accounted for 40-58% of the drug-related material. The 
magnitude of the proportion of radiolabel not attributable to lamivudine suggests that metabolic 
clearance is of greater importance in the dog than in the rat. Clearance was approximately 5.5-5.7 L/h 
and renal clearance accounted for about 1.5-2.3 L/h. The renal clearance value is lower than the 
glomerular filtration rate, indicating that tubular secretion does not play a significant role in the 
elimination in dog. The volume of distribution was 12.4 L, which equated to the volume occupied by 
total body water. 
Kinetics after oral administration 
After single oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg) to rats (studies GDM/91/015 and 
GDM/91/077), the oral bioavailability was approximately 60%. Peak concentrations (4 µg/mL) were 
detected at 1.5 hours post-dose. No gender differences were observed. In rats dosed orally with 
lamivudine at 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500 or 2000 mg/kg (study GDM/91/003), the maximum plasma 
concentrations ranged from 41 µg/mL at the lowest dose level to 107 µg/mL at the highest dose level 
at 1 to 2 hours after dosing. The plasma half-life increased from 3.7 hours at 600 mg/kg to 4.6 hours 
at 1500 and 2000 mg/kg. Both Cmax and AUC in the dose range 600 to 2000 mg/kg were dose 
proportional. Following single oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg) to rabbits, peak 
concentrations (13.7 µg/mL) were detected within 1 hour after dosing (study GDM/91/058). 
Lamivudine declined with an elimination half-life of approximately 3.6 hours. After single oral 
administration of [3H]-lamivudine (30 mg/kg), the oral bioavailability of lamivudine in the dog was 
67-83% (studies DM/91/008 and GDM/91/080). Peak plasma concentrations (13.6-26.6 µg/mL) were 
observed at approximately 40 minutes. The elimination half-life ranged from 1.3 to 1.6 hours. 
Following oral administration of lamivudine at dose levels of 500, 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg/kg (study 
GDM/91/036), both Cmax and AUC increased less than dose proportional. 
In mice administered 1000 mg/kg BID of lamivudine for 37 days (study WPT/93/572), the AUC was 
153-217 µg × h/mL. Oral gavage and administration of lamivudine via the diet did not lead to different 
kinetics in mice (study WPT/92/419). In rat following repeated oral dosing with lamivudine (45, 300 or 
2000 mg/kg BID) for 1 month (study WPT/91/104), Cmax and AUC were similar on Day 1 and 35. In a 
13 week oral toxicity study in rats, lamivudine was administered at dosages of 45, 300 or 2000 mg/kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 23/114 
 
  
  
BID (study WPT/91/435). At all dose levels the plasma AUC values calculated for Day 92 were higher 
than for Day 1. The plasma level time profiles for Days 1 and 92 showed no evidence of a change in 
the plasma clearance of lamivudine, but suggest that some form of secondary absorption could be 
responsible for the difference in AUC values. In a 6-month toxicity study in rats, animals received 
lamivudine at doses of 90, 425 or 2000 mg/kg BID (12 hour dose interval) (study WPT/93/361). 
Plasma AUC values did not show any consistent change over the 6 month dosing period with the 
exception of those in high dose female rats where an increase was observed. Oral gavage and 
administration of lamivudine via the diet did not lead to different kinetics in rat (study WPT/92/323). 
Following repeated oral dosing with lamivudine (45, 150 or 500 mg/kg BID with a 12 hour dose 
interval) to rabbits (study WPT/92/014), a significant increase in the plasma concentrations of 
lamivudine between the first and last administration. In another study in rabbits, lamivudine was 
administered at dosages of 7.5, 20 or 45 mg/kg BID (study WPT/92/184). A significant increase in the 
plasma concentrations of lamivudine between the first and last administration at all three dose levels 
was observed. Following repeated oral dosing with lamivudine (1500 mg/kg BID) for 14 days in dog 
(study WPT/91/222), an increase in plasma AUC was observed. In a 13-week oral toxicity study in 
dogs, lamivudine was administered at dosages of 45, 260 or 1500 mg/kg BID (study WPT/92/132). At 
all 3 dose levels, AUC values for Day 91 were higher than those for Day 1. In a 52-week oral toxicity 
study, lamivudine was administered at 45, 260 and 1000 (females) or 1500 (males) mg/kg BID (study 
WPT/92/407). AUC values in Week 52 were higher than those on Day 1 at all dose levels. 
Kinetics in juvenile rats 
The kinetics of lamivudine (45 or 2000 mg/kg) after single oral administration were investigated in 
juvenile rats on litter Day 16 (study WPT/92/190). The mean AUC and Cmax values obtained at both 
dose levels were considerably higher than those in adult. The data suggest that the systemic exposure 
to lamivudine of a juvenile rat is at least twice that of an adult rat receiving an equivalent dose. 
Combination of dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine 
The Applicant did not provide non-clinical in vivo kinetic studies in which the combination of 
dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine was administered. 
Distribution 
Abacavir 
Membrane permeability 
Abacavir (1 to 100 µM) is passively transported over Caco-2 and MDCK-hMDR1 cells (study 
RD1998/00626). In an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, abacavir (1 and 200 µM) penetrated the 
endothelial cells by passive diffusion (study RD1997/02021). 
Plasma protein binding 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of abacavir (0.03 to 10.3 µg/mL) was 18.5% in mouse, 38.7% in 
monkey and 49.4% in humans (study TBZZ/93/0010).Plasma protein binding was independent of 
concentration over the range tested. 
Blood-to-plasma ratio 
The Applicant provided no data on the blood-to-plasma ratio of abacavir. 
In vivo distribution 
Tissue distribution of [14C]-abacavir was assessed in albino and pigmented fasted mice following a 
single oral dose of 10 mg/kg (study RD1996/00065). Concentrations 15 minutes after dosing were 
highest in the gall bladder, gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, kidney, adrenal gland, uveal tract of 
Assessment report

the eye and nasal turbinates. Although radioactivity penetrated into the CSF, penetration into the brain 
was minimal. Ratios of CSF:blood and brain:blood were 0.51 and 0.09 at 15 minutes, respectively, and 
0.36 and 0.11 at 2 hours, respectively. By 16 hours, levels in most tissues were below the limit of 
quantitation. Seven days following dose administration, radioactivity concentrations were low but still 
quantifiable in the oesophagus, uveal tract of pigmented mice, liver, nasal turbinates, outer ear and 
skin, indicating binding to melanin. 
In addition, tissue distribution of [14C]-abacavir was investigated in pregnant rats following a single 
oral dose of 10 mg/kg (study RD1997/04000). Radioactivity was rapidly absorbed and widely 
distributed. Highest concentrations were detected in the kidney and stomach mucosa at 1 hour and in 
the kidney, liver, adrenal and gastrointestinal tract mucosa 6 hours following dosing. By 48 hours after 
dosing, concentrations were only quantifiable in the liver and adrenal. 
Placental transfer 
The placental transfer of [14C]-abacavir was investigated in pregnant rats following single oral 
administration at 10 mg/kg (study RD1997/04000). Abacavir related radioactivity is able to cross the 
placental barrier, with highest radioactivity concentrations in fetal tissues at 1 hour when 
concentrations were comparable to those in maternal blood. 
The placental transfer of [14C]-abacavir was also investigated in pregnant rabbits following a single oral 
dose of 10 mg/kg (study RD1997/04000). By 1 hour after dosing, maximum blood concentrations were 
achieved in dams, and radioactivity was shown to cross the placental barrier. Radioactivity 
concentrations were generally quantifiable in all fetal tissues, but generally less than half those in 
maternal blood. 
Dolutegravir 
Membrane permeability 
The passive membrane permeability of [14C]-dolutegravir (3 µM) at pH 7.4 and the absorptive 
membrane permeability at pH 5.5 and 7.4 in the presence of FaSSIF (fasted state simulated intestinal 
fluid) was investigated in vitro in MDCKII-hMDR1 cells (study RD2008/00360). Dolutegravir was 
determined to have high passive membrane permeability at pH 7.4. The absorptive membrane 
permeability of [14C]-dolutegravir in the presence of FaSSIF were both high at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. 
These high permeability values are consistent with good absorption of dolutegravir when administered 
as a solution, and the high permeability values and the low solubility of dolutegravir classify it as a BCS 
II compound. 
Plasma protein binding 
The in vitro protein binding of dolutegravir at 10 µM (4.2 µg/mL) was 99.9% in rat, 95.4% in dog, 
99.1% in monkey and 99.3% in human serum (study RH2007/00106). In another study, the in vitro 
protein binding of dolutegravir (0.21 to 21 µg/mL = 0.5 to 50 µM) was 91.5 to 93.8% in human 
plasma and tended to decrease with increasing concentration of dolutegravir in plasma. In a second 
in vitro human plasma protein binding study with dolutegravir (0.5 to 25 µM), the plasma protein 
binding was high (99.3%) and concentration independent. 
Blood-to-plasma ratio 
The blood-to-plasma ratios were determined for radioactivity in in vivo studies in mouse, rat and 
monkey. In mice, the blood to plasma ratios of radioactivity ranged from 0.49 to 0.54. The blood to 
plasma ratios of total radioactivity ranged from 0.51 to 0.53 in rat. In monkey, the blood-to-plasma 
ratio ranged from 0.64 to 0.79 through 24 hours post-dose. Overall, these data indicate that 
radioactivity was largely associated with plasma components of blood. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 25/114 
 
  
  
Tissue distribution 
A whole body autoradiography study was conducted using partially pigmented Lister-Hooded male rats 
administered a single oral dose of [14C]-dolutegravir (50 mg/kg) (study CD2008/00195). Radioactivity 
was widely distributed with most tissues containing peak levels at 6 hours. Peak blood concentrations 
of radioactivity also occurred at 6 hours and declined to below the limit of quantification at 28 days. 
Concentrations of radioactivity in the brain were low (~2% of the blood radiocarbon concentration). By 
28 days post-dose, only bone and skin contained quantifiable levels of radioactivity. 
Placental transfer 
The distribution and placental transfer of radioactivity were determined following administration of a 
single oral dose of [14C]-dolutegravir (50 mg/kg) to pregnant rats on gestation Day 18 (study 
2012N137348). Placental transfer of radioactivity was evident. Radioactivity was rapidly and widely 
distributed to most dam and fetal tissues, with the highest values obtained from 2 to 10 hours 
post-dose. The concentration in the whole fetus was 2410 ng equiv/g at 2 hours post-dose, and 
steadily increased to 3950 ng equiv/g at 10 hours post-dose before decreasing to 1250 ng equiv/g at 
24 hours post-dose. 
Lamivudine 
Plasma protein binding 
The plasma protein binding of [3H]-lamivudine was studied in vitro in rat, dog and human by 
equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range 0.1 to 100 µg/mL. The binding of lamivudine to rat 
plasma proteins was concentration-dependent. At the lowest concentration, the percentage binding 
was 49% which decreased to 16% at 1 µg/mL and <10% at 10 and 100 µg/mL (study GDM/91/010). 
In dog, the plasma protein binding was also concentration-dependent. At 0.1 µg/mL, the percentage 
binding was 42% which decreased to 12% at 1 µg/mL and <10% at 10 and 100 µg/mL(study 
GDM/91/010). The binding of lamivudine to plasma proteins was also concentration-dependent in 
human plasma. The binding was 36% at 0.1 µg/mL and <10% at 1, 10 and 100 µg/mL (study 
GDM/91/010). In addition, the in vitro binding of lamivudine (0.01, 0.1, 1 or 10 µg/mL) to plasma 
proteins of blood obtained from rats, dogs and humans was investigated after incubation for 22 hours 
in dialysis cells (study NME/96/011). All 3 species showed very low binding (3 to 7%) of lamivudine to 
plasma proteins. 
Blood-to-plasma ratio 
The blood-to-plasma ratio of [3H]-lamivudine was investigated for rat, dog and human in vitro over the 
concentration range 0.1 to 100 µg/mL. The amount of radioactive material associated with rat 
erythrocytes was in the range 41 to 47%, and was independent of concentration (study GDM/91/010). 
In dog, the amount of radioactive material associated with erythrocytes was 39 to 47% and 
independent of concentration (study GDM/91/010). In humans, the amount of radiolabelled material 
associated with erythrocytes was 53 to 57% (independent of concentration) (study GDM/91/010). Rat, 
dog and human showed erythrocyte distribution similar to haematocrit values that was independent of 
concentration, thus demonstrating no specific binding of lamivudine to erythrocytes (study 
NME/96/011). 
In vivo distribution 
The in vivo distribution of lamuvidine (30 mg/kg) was investigated albino and pigmented rats using 
whole body autoradiography with optical densitometry (study GDM/90/040). In the albino rat, 
radioactivity was widely distributed throughout tissues and peak concentrations were observed at 
approximately 1 hour after dosing in most tissues with the highest concentrations seen in the kidney 
and bladder. Tissue levels were generally higher than those seen in blood at corresponding time points. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 26/114 
 
  
  
Clearance from the tissues was rapid and by 8 hours, the only tissue to have significant levels of 
radioactivity was the kidney. By 96 hours, no radiolabelled material could be detected in any tissue. In 
pigmented rats, there was no evidence of binding to melanin containing tissues. 
Placental transfer 
The placental transfer of lamivudine (45 mg/kg) was investigated in pregnant rats and rabbits using 
whole body autoradiography with optical densitometry or liquid scintillation counting (study 
GDM/91/050 and GDM/91/059). Rats were killed 1 hour after oral administration on Day 12 of 
pregnancy or 1, 4 and 24 hours after the same treatment on Day 19 of pregnancy. One hour after 
dosing on Day 12 or Day 19, the levels in maternal blood and placentae were markedly higher than 
those in the fetuses. Radiolabelled material was evenly distributed throughout the fetuses with no 
localisation in any particular organ or tissue. At 24 hours post-dose, radiolabelled material had been 
eliminated from both maternal and fetal tissues. Rabbits on Day 20 of pregnancy were killed 
approximately 1, 4 and 24 hours after oral administration. The extent of placental transfer was low and 
less than 0.007% of the administered dose reached each fetus. 
Metabolism 
Abacavir 
In vitro metabolism 
[14C]-abacavir (3 µg/mL) was incubated with rat and human hepatocytes in the presence and absence 
of the ADH inhibitor, 4-methyl pyrazole (4-MP), or the CYP inhibitor, aminobenzotriazole (ABT) (study 
RD2000/02309). Non-extractable abacavir-derived residues were observed in both human and rat 
hepatocyte incubations. Both 4-MP and ABT markedly inhibited (33 to 77%) non-extractable residue 
levels in incubations of abacavir with both rat and human hepatocytes, demonstrating the enzymatic 
nature of abacavir bioactivation. To determine if oxidation of abacavir to the carboxylic acid via an 
aldehyde intermediate results in covalent binding to protein in human or rat in vitro systems, 
[14C]-abacavir (3 µg/mL) was incubated rat and human liver cytosol (study RD2001/01777). NAD 
(co-factor)-dependent, protein bound residues were observed in rat and human liver cytosol and was 
ADH mediated. These observations are consistent with ADH involvement in carboxylic acid and protein 
bound residue formation in rat and human in vitro systems. Incubations of [14C]-abacavir (3 µg/mL) 
with pooled rat and human liver microsomes resulted in low, but detectable levels of NADPH (co-
factor)-dependent, non-extractable, protein bound residues (study RD2002/01227). These were 
decreased in the presence of a non-isozyme selective CYP inhibitor. Only human and rat CYP1A2 
yielded notable co-factor-dependent non-extractable residues, indicating the potential for a similar 
bioactivation process in the rat compared to humans. 
The two major metabolites of abacavir in humans are 2269W93 and 361W94. Production of 361W94 is 
mediated by UGT2B7. However, metabolic turnover with UGT2B7 was thus only detectable at 
concentrations in significant excess of the usual plasma concentrations encountered clinically. 
However, in contrast to the other isozymes examined under identical conditions, UGT2B7 was the only 
isoform that showed any abacavir glucuronidation in vitro (study RD2000/02310). UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 
1A6, 1A7, 1A9, 1A10 and 2B15 were not capable to glucuronidate abacavir. Alcohol dehydrogenase αα 
(ADH αα) is involved in the formation of 2269W93 from abacavir (study RD2001/01777). 
In vivo metabolism 
The Applicant provided no information on the metabolite profile in plasma. It is therefore unknown if 
the major human metabolites are also present in the non-clinical species.

Dolutegravir 
In vitro metabolism studies 
Dolutegravir (1 µM) was stable in rat, monkey and human S9 fractions up to 60 minutes (study 
RH2007/00076). Dolutegravir (0.5 µM) was also stable in rat cryopreserved hepatocytes and in both 
fresh and cryopreserved human hepatocytes (t ½ >360 minutes) (study RH2007/00076). In fresh rat 
hepatocytes, the intrinsic clearance was 25 mL/min/kg bw and the t½ was 268 minutes. In addition, 
no metabolites were detected when dolutegravir was incubated up to 24 hours with cryopreserved rat, 
dog, monkey and human hepatocytes (study RH2007/00060). In another study, the metabolic 
turnover of [14C]-dolutegravir in rat and monkey hepatocytes was low and similar to human 
hepatocytes (approximately 3.5 to 9.4% turnover) (study RD2007/01496). In human hepatocytes, the 
notable route of metabolism for [14C]-dolutegravir was glucuronidation. Metabolite profiles of the 
non-clinical species and human were qualitatively similar and the human glucuronidation metabolite 
was observed in hepatocytes from the two non-clinical species. In perfused rat liver, dolutegravir was 
metabolised to M1 (N-dealkylation), M7 (oxidation), M2 (hexose conjugation), M3 (glucuronidation), 
M4 and M5 (hexose or glucuronide conjugation in combination with N-dealkylation), and M6 and M8 
(hexose or glucuronide conjugation in combination with oxidation) (study RD2007/01493). 
Metabolites M1 (N-dealkylation) and M7 (oxidation) of dolutegravir were formed by CYP3A4 (study 
RD2008/00373/00). Incubations with recombinant CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 showed no 
metabolism. The data suggest that CYP3A4 is the primary CYP enzyme involved in the Phase I 
metabolism of dolutegravir in vitro. In addition, dolutegravir was conjugated to an ether glucuronide 
(M3) by UGT1A1 (study RH2007/00104). Dolutegravir glucuronidation was also observed in 
recombinant UGT1A3 and 1A9 incubations, but to a lesser extent in comparison to UGT1A1 (study 
RD2008/01339). Glucuronidation was not observed in recombinant UGT1A4, 1A6, 2B4, 2B7, and 2B15 
incubations. These data suggest that UGT1A1 is the primary UGT enzyme involved in the 
glucuronidation of dolutegravir in vitro, with contribution from UGT1A3 and 1A9. 
Dolutegravir has two chiral centers, so the potential for metabolism of dolutegravir (10 M) to its 
respective enantiomer and two diastereomers was investigated in incubations with cryopreserved rat, 
dog, monkey and human hepatocytes (study RH2007/00105). Although low amounts (~0.4% of the 
peak area of dolutegravir) of the enantiomer (GSK1426983) were detected at all incubation times, 
concentrations of GSK1426983 did not increase with time and no peak that corresponded with the 
diastereomer (GSK1747005) was detected. Formation of the diastereomer of its enantiomer 
(GSK1747009) could not be determined, because GSK1747009 could not be separated 
chromatographically from dolutegravir. 
Dolutegravir (100 µM) was tested in a glutathione reactive metabolite trapping assay using rat and 
pooled human liver microsomes (study RH2007/00058). The results showed in vitro evidence for 
formation of a metabolite consistent with addition of glutathione through oxidative defluorination in 
both rat and human liver microsomes. 
In vivo metabolism 
The in vivo metabolism of dolutegravir was investigated in male and female mice following a single oral 
dose of [14C]-dolutegravir at 100 mg/kg (study RD2009/00723). Dolutegravir was the principal 
radiolabeled component in mouse plasma (78-90% of plasma radioactivity). Two unknown metabolites 
were present in mouse plasma through 24 hours post-dose and represented 1.3 to 6.6% of the plasma 
radiocarbon. The in vivo metabolism of dolutegravir was also investigated in rats following a single oral 
dose of [14C]-dolutegravir at a dose level of 50 mg/kg (study RD2008/00220). The only quantifiable 
radiolabeled component in plasma was unchanged dolutegravir representing 90-98% of plasma 
radioactivity. There was no evidence for in vivo epimerization of dolutegravir to any of its

stereoisomers, GSK1747005, GSK1747009 or GSK1426983, in juvenile rat plasma samples following 
repeat oral administration of dolutegravir. Furthermore, the in vivo metabolism of dolutegravir was 
investigated in monkeys following a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of [14C]-dolutegravir (study 
RD2008/00899). Through 24 hours post-dose, dolutegravir was the principal radiolabeled component 
in plasma (85-99% of the plasma radioactivity). Dolutegravir glucuronide (M3) was present at low 
concentrations (~3.5% of plasma radioactivity). In monkey, no notable differences in the metabolic 
profile between males and females were observed. 
Lamivudine 
In vitro metabolism 
The Applicant did not provide any in vitro metabolism studies. It is therefore, unknown which enzymes 
are involved in the metabolism of lamivudine. 
In vivo metabolism 
No information on the metabolism pattern in plasma from the non-clinical species was provided by the 
Applicant. 
Chiral conversion 
Plasma samples were obtained from pharmacokinetic studies conducted with lamivudine in dogs and 
humans (study WD1997/00356). Chiral analysis was performed to determine if chiral inversion of 
lamivudine occurs in vivo. No chiral inversion of lamivudine was observed. 
Excretion 
Abacavir 
In vivo elimination 
The recovery of [14C]-radioactivity in urine and faeces was investigated following single oral 
administration of [14C]-abacavir to mice (38 mg/kg) (study TEIN/94/0001), rat (15 mg/kg) (study 
RD1999/00510) and monkey (15 µg/kg) (study TEIN/94/0006). The cumulative recovery of 
radioactivity in the urine was 74-90% of the total dose in mice, with the majority excreted over the 
first 8 hours (70-83%). In the faeces, recovery was 21% (16% within the first 8 hours). In rat, most 
of the dose (~74%) was excreted via urine, indicating extensive absorption following oral 
administration. In monkey, also the majority (79% of the total dose) was excreted in urine within 
8 hours, with total urinary and faecal excretion representing 92% and 7.4% of the total dose, 
respectively, from 0 to 72 hours after dosing. 
Metabolism pattern in the excreta 
The major excretion route was via urine. Therefore, metabolite profiles were determined in urine. No 
metabolite profiles were determined in bile and faeces. In mice administered a single oral dose of 
38-40 mg/kg, the major compounds detected from 0-48 hours in urine were parent drug (10.5% of 
the total dose), 2269W93 (23.6%), 361W94 (11.5%) and four unidentified abacavir-related peak 
regions (representing 10.2, 6.1, 4.1 and 3.4% of the total dose) (studies TEIN/94/0001).  139U91 
(2, 6-diamino analogue of abacavir), carbovir (1144U88; guanine analogue of abacavir) and 2083U88 
(5’-carboxylate of carbovir) were detected as only 1.7, 1.8 and 0.7% the total dose, respectively. Six 
additional unidentified abacavir-related radiochromatographic peak regions represented a total of 9.1% 
of the dose. There were no sex-related differences in the metabolism of abacavir. In rats following a 
single oral dose of 15 mg/kg [14C]-abacavir (study RD1999/00510), the metabolite profile in urine 
(0-72 h) was 11% as parent compound and approximately 64% of the oral dose as metabolites. The 
major metabolites in rat urine were 2269W93 (~39% of dose) and an unidentified metabolite that 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 29/114 
 
  
  
appeared to be less polar than abacavir (~11% of dose). In addition, following a single oral 
administration of [14C]-abacavir to monkeys (21 mg(salt)/kg) (study TEIN/94/0006), abacavir was 
extensively metabolised with 361W94 and 2269W93 detected at 32 and 20% of the total dose, 
respectively, during the first 72 hours after dosing. Parent drug was 12.6% of the total dose. One 
unidentified abacavir-related peak region comprised 15% of the total dose, whereas others generally 
comprised less than 1% each during the same time interval following dosing. 
Milk excretion 
The milk transfer of drug-related material following a single oral dose of [14C]-abacavir (35 mg/kg) was 
investigated in rats (study RD1997/01909). Concentrations of abacavir in milk were generally slightly 
higher than those in plasma. This demonstrates the excretion of drug-related material into the milk of 
lactating rats. 
Dolutegravir 
In vivo elimination 
The elimination of radioactivity was investigated following a single oral administration of 
[14C]-dolutegravir (100 mg/kg) to intact and bile duct cannulated (BDC) mice (study RD2009/00562). 
Faecal excretion was the primary route for elimination of radioactivity in intact mice (93-94% of the 
administered dose), while urinary elimination accounted for less than 2% of the administered dose. 
Elimination of radioactivity was rapid with the majority of the dose (>92%) being recovered within 
24 hours post-dose. In BDC mice, biliary secretion accounted for a mean of 2.5% of the dose, while 
means of 86 and 1.8% were eliminated via faeces and urine, respectively. 
The elimination of radioactivity was also investigated in intact and BDC rats following a single oral 
administration of 50 mg/kg of [14C]-dolutegravir (study RD2008/00108). The major route of 
elimination of drug-related material in intact rats was via the faeces (91-93%). Urinary elimination 
accounted for less than 4% of the dose. Elimination of radioactivity was rapid with the majority of the 
dose (>83%) being recovered within 24 hours post-dose. In BDC rats, means of 7.0%, 86% and 2.5% 
of the dose were eliminated via the bile, faeces and urine, respectively. 
Furthermore, the elimination of radioactivity were investigated in intact and BDC monkeys after a 
single oral administration of [14C]-dolutegravir (10 mg/kg) (studies RD2008/01300 and 
RD2008/01299). The predominant route of elimination of radioactivity in intact monkeys was via faecal 
excretion (67-78). Urinary excretion accounted for 4.4-6.0% of the dose. In BDC monkeys, biliary 
secretion accounted for a mean of 12% of the administered dose. Mean faecal and urinary recoveries 
of radioactivity were 70% and 7.2%, respectively. 
Metabolism pattern in the excreta 
In mice, dolutegravir glucuronide (M3) and a metabolite resulting from fluorine loss and the addition of 
glutathione and oxidation were the principal components in mouse bile accounting for 0.7 and 0.5% of 
the dose, respectively. Other identified metabolites in the bile each represented ~0.2% of the dose. 
Dolutegravir glucuronide (M3) was also the major component in the urine (0.6-0.9% of the dose). 
Metabolites resulting from hexose conjugation of parent, N-dealkylation and an oxidation at the 
benzylic carbon were also observed as minor components in urine (~0.1% of the dose). Dolutegravir 
represented ~0.1% of the dose in urine, 0.2% of the dose in bile and 89% of the dose in faeces. 
In rat, the majority of the radioactivity was unchanged dolutegravir in faeces (86% of the dose). 
Oxidation and N-dealkylation were the major biotransformation products in the urine (1.2 and 0.7% of 
the dose). Other notable metabolites observed in rat urine resulted from glucuronidation (M3) and 
hexose conjugation (each representing 0.4% of the dose). The predominant metabolites in rat bile 
resulted from glucuronidation (M3) and hexose conjugation (together 4.0% of the dose). Other notable 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 30/114 
 
  
  
metabolites in bile included loss of fluorine in combination with oxidation and glutathione addition 
(0.8% of the dose) and pentose conjugation (0.1% of the dose). Biliary and renal elimination of 
unchanged dolutegravir was very low over the time period examined (~0.1% of the dose). 
In monkey, biliary and renal elimination of dolutegravir was very low (~0.3% of the dose). 
Conjugation was the primary biotransformation process for the formation of biliary and urinary 
metabolites. Glucuronide (M3) (~4.5% of dose) and hexose conjugates (3.5% of dose) were the 
principal components in bile. A metabolite, resulting from fluorine loss and the addition of cysteine and 
oxygen, was a notable radioactive component in bile (<2.0% of the dose), but was not measurable in 
urine. Dolutegravir glucuronide (M3) was the major component in the urine (3.1% of the dose). A 
hexose conjugate and N-dealkylated metabolite were also observed as minor components in urine 
(<0.5% of the dose). Dolutegravir was the only notable component in faeces (64% of the dose). 
Milk excretion 
Lacteal excretion of radioactivity was determined following administration of a single oral dose of 
[14C]-dolutegravir (50 mg/kg) to lactating rats (study 2012N137348). Mean milk to blood 
concentration ratios were 0.45 at 1 hour post-dose, steadily increased to a maximum of 2.3 at 8 hours 
post-dose, and then decreased to 1.3 at 24 hours post-dose. 
Identification of dolutegravir-related material in samples was accomplished by radio-HPLC/MS/MS. 
Dolutegravir was the predominant component in the rat milk (83-97% of the radiocarbon over the 
24 hours sampling period). In addition, minor uncharacterized components were observed that were 
below the quantifiable limit (LLQ). 
Lamivudine 
In vivo elimination 
Following IV administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg) to mice (study GDM/92/045), the mean 
total recovery was ~68% (range 51% to 98%). Urinary excretion accounted for ~55% of the 
administered dose, the majority in the first 24 hours after dosing. Faecal excretion accounted for ~5% 
of the administered dose. After oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg) to mice (study 
GDM/92/045), the mean total recovery of radioactivity was ~89%. Urinary excretion accounted for 
approximately 54% of the administered radioactivity, the majority in the first 24 hours after dosing. 
Faecal excretion accounted for ~29% of the administered dose. 
Following oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg) to rats, the mean total recovery of 
radioactivity was approximately 96% (study GDM/91/014). Renal clearance was the principal route of 
elimination with 61% of the dose excreted in the urine and approximately 34% in the faeces. The 
majority of the dose was excreted within 24 hours. In another study, the mean total recovery of 
radioactivity was approximately 93% (study GDM/94/076). Urinary and faecal excretion accounted for 
approximately 57% and 35% of the dose, respectively. A study in pregnant rat showed that pregnancy 
has no effect on the excretion pattern for the elimination of drug-related material (study 
GDM/91/050). The biliary excretion of radioactivity following a single oral administration of [3H]-
lamivudine (2 mg/kg) has been investigated in rat (study NME/96/007). Levels of radioactivity 
excreted within 48 hours of dosing were 82% of the dose in urine, 19% of the dose in faeces and 0% 
in bile. 
Following oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine (45 mg/kg), there were no differences in the routes of 
excretion between pregnant and non-pregnant rabbits (study GDM/91/059). Renal clearance was the 
principal route of elimination with approximately 50% of the dose excreted in the urine and between 3 
and 30% in the faeces. The majority of the dose was excreted within 24 hours. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014

Following IV administration of [3H]-lamivudine (30 mg/kg) to dogs (studies GDM/91/008 and 
GDM/91/080), urinary excretion accounted for 82-91% of the administered dose. Faecal elimination 
accounted for 1-3% of the dose. Elimination was rapid with the majority of the dose excreted within 24 
hours after dosing. Following oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine (30 mg/kg) to dogs (studies 
GDM/91/008 and GDM/91/080), 78-90% of the dose was excreted via urine. Faecal elimination 
accounted for 1-3% of the dose. 
Metabolism pattern in the excreta 
The urinary metabolic profile of lamivudine was determined in mice following a single IV dose of 
[3H]-lamivudine at 45 mg/kg (study GDM/92/045). Analysis of 0 to 24 hour urine samples indicated 
that unchanged lamivudine accounted for approximately 90% of the urinary radioactivity. The 
remainder of the urinary radioactivity was accounted for by the trans-sulphoxide (GI138870X) and the 
cis-sulphoxide in approximately equal proportions. Following oral administration, the metabolic profile 
was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that following IV administration (study GDM/92/045). 
The metabolic profile of lamivudine was determined in urine from rats following IV administration of 
[3H]-lamivudine at 45 mg/kg (studies GDM/91/014 GDM/94/076). Unchanged lamivudine accounted 
for approximately 92-96% of the urinary radioactivity. Two metabolites were detected, with 
GI138870X present as the major metabolite (<4% to 6%). Following the oral administration, the 
metabolic profile was similar to that following intravenous administration (study GDM/91/014). 
Following oral administration, 98% of the radiolabelled material in faeces corresponded to unchanged 
lamivudine. The metabolic profile of lamivudine in pregnant rats is the same as that in non-pregnant 
rats (study GDM/91/050). Following either oral or intravenous administration of [3H]-lamivudine 
(2 mg/kg) to rat (study NME/96/017), the majority of drug-related material was excreted in the urine 
as unchanged lamivudine within the first 10 hours of dosing. Low levels (2 to 3%) of radioactivity were 
present as the trans-sulphoxide metabolite. 
In rabbit, also unchanged lamivudine was the major component present in urine (80% of urinary 
radioactivity) following oral administration of [3H]-lamivudine at 45 mg/kg (study GDM/91/059). Two 
metabolites were detected, each of which accounted for between 7 and 16% of the urinary 
radioactivity. Unchanged lamivudine accounted for more than 95% of the faecal radioactivity. One 
minor metabolite was detected which accounted for approximately 5% of the faecal radioactivity. 
The metabolism profile of lamivudine has been studied in dogs following IV administration of 
[3H]-lamivudine at 30 mg/kg (studies GDM/91/008 and GDM/91/080. Unchanged lamivudine 
accounted for 27-48% of the dose. Two major metabolite peaks accounted for 11-22% 
(cis-sulphoxide) and 17-28% (trans-sulphoxide) of the dose. The chromatographic retention time of 
the principal metabolite corresponded for the trans-sulphoxide of lamivudine. Following oral 
administration, unchanged lamivudine accounted for 20-39% of the dose (studies GDM/91/008 and 
GDM/91/080). The remaining radioactivity was attributable by trans-sulphoxide (33% of the dose) and 
cis-sulphoxide (18% of the dose). Following a single oral dose of [3H]-lamivudine (2 mg/kg) to dogs 
(studies NME/97/014 and NME/97/010), cytosine (17-20% of the radioactivity), trans-sulphoxide 
(30-35% of the radioactivity) and lamivudine (30-32% of the radioactivity) were observed in urine. 
There was no gender difference in the pattern of urinary excretion of the metabolites. 
Milk excretion 
The milk transference of lamivudine (45 mg/kg) after oral administration was studied in rat at least 
14 days post-partum (study GDM/92/017). Plasma concentrations of lamivudine were highest (mean 
11 µg/mL) at 0.5 hours after dosing and decreased steadily to a mean concentration of 0.3 µg/mL at 
8 hours. Milk concentrations of lamivudine were highest (14 µg/mL) at 4 hours after dosing and fell to 
4.8 µg/mL at 8 hours. Lamivudine was not detected in milk after 24 hours.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Abacavir 
Abacavir had a low potential for toxicity in mice and rats. The median lethal doses were more than 100 
times higher than the dose of 600 mg once daily.  
Dolutegravir 
No single dose studies were performed with dolutegravir. Investigations for acute effects were 
incorporated in repeat dose toxicity studies. Dolutegravir was not tolerated at doses ≥300 mg/kg/day 
in the 14 day monkey toxicity study and resulted in severe gastrointestinal intolerance leading to 
morbidity and mortality. A single dose toxicokinetics study in dogs was conducted at doses up to 500 
mg/kg. Dolutegravir was not tolerated and resulted in vomiting at doses ≥150 mg/kg. 
Lamivudine 
Single dose toxicity of lamivudine after intravenous or oral administration was studied in rodents. The 
acute toxicity was low, where doses up to 2000 mg/kg i.v. (both species) or 2x2000 mg/kg orally 
(mice only) were well tolerated without signs of target organ toxicity. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Abacavir 
Studies were conducted in mice with doses up to 708 mg/kg/day for 1 and 6 months, and in 
cynomolgus monkeys with doses up to 297 mg/kg/day for 1, 3 and 12 months. In addition, a 3-month 
study was performed in rats with doses up to 452 mg/kg/day. The primary target organ for toxicity of 
abacavir is the liver in mice, rats and monkeys. Increased liver weight was observed at 234 mg/kg/day 
in mice and 200 mg/kg/day in rats associated with mild hepatocellular hypertrophy, increased pigment 
deposits in the centrilobular hepatocytes and/or Kupffer cells in both species at these dosages. All 
treatment-related findings reversed following the recovery period. Slight increase in some CYP450 
enzymes activity was observed after 6-month administration to rodents. In monkeys, there were minor 
changes in serum triglyceride concentrations and equivocal increases in alanine aminotransferase were 
seen at 297 mg/kg/day. Abacavir caused changes in the haemapoietic system. In rats these changes, 
occasionally noted at all doses, included minimal decrease in red blood cell parameters and increased 
leucocytes count (especially lymphocytes). There was no evidence of an effect on bone marrow. These 
changes reversed in the recovery period. In monkeys, the haematological changes noted at all doses 
were mild and corresponded to slight decreases in red blood cell counts occasionally accompanied by 
decreased haemoglobin concentrations and haematocrit. In the 3-month study in rats, germ cell loss in 
the testis was seen in males at the highest dose of 452 mg/kg/day. The reversibility of the finding was 
not investigated, but the no effect level for this finding was 96 mg/kg/day, at which systemic exposure 
was 13 times higher than in humans following a once daily 600 mg dose.  
Dolutegravir 
In a 13-week study in mice, dolutegravir at 500 mg/kg induced slight increases in bilirubin and liver 
transaminases and mucous neck cells in stomach appeared increased. Systemic exposure at a dose of 
500 mg/kg corresponded to approx. x15 expected clinical. 
In rat repeated dose toxicity studies that ranged from 2 weeks to 26 weeks, the principal toxicity was 
manifested as gastric mucosal changes and lesions. Findings included eosinophilic infiltration, 
thickening of the limiting ridge mucosa, edema, acanthosis as well as incidences of microscopic 
hemorrhage in the glandular stomach at doses of 500 mg/kg and higher, providing considerable 
Assessment report

exposure multiples (x17-23) to expected human exposure. The changes were attributed to local 
irritating properties and showed reversibility during a 1 month treatment free period.  
In a 2 week monkey study deaths occurred at the high dose of 1000 mg/kg. Clinical chemistry changes 
in this study included increases in bilirubin and liver transaminases and decreases in red blood cells 
and reticulocytes and lymphocytes. Microscopic evaluations showed liver hypertrophy and liver single 
cell necrosis (at 1000 mg/kg) and atrophy and haemorrhage of mucosal epithelium in the stomach. 
The doses at which liver toxicity was recorded corresponded to x4 to x5 the expected clinical exposure. 
In a 1-month monkey study, the NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day at which dose a slight decrease in body 
weight and an increase in neutrophils were noted. The primary effects consisted of atrophy of cecum, 
colon, rectum and inflammatory cell infiltration. No liver related pathology was reported, but an 
increase in bilirubin in high dose females was apparent. In the pivotal 38 week study in monkey the 
high dose was 50 mg/kg, but this was decreased to 30 mg/kg due to intolerance and deaths at 50 
mg/kg. Moribund animals had mononuclear cell infiltration and slight haemorrhage in the lamina 
propria in the cecum and colon. Gastrointestinal toxicity seemed the most likely cause of deaths. A 
high dose male that had to be euthanized had elevated bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase, but 
no other indications of liver malfunction. The NOAEL in the 38 week study was considered 15 mg/kg. 
The doses in this study corresponded to systemic exposure multiples below unity in comparison with 
expected clinical values. 
In both rat and monkey hematopoietic effects such as increases in mean platelets volumes and red cell 
distribution width as well as increases in reticulocytes were recorded.  
Taken together the studies on dolutegravir toxicity showed that monkey was particularly sensitive to 
adverse effects possibly related to gastrointestinal intolerance. Adverse effects of dolutegravir were 
evident in the stomach, cecum, colon, rectum in both rat and monkey, but based on both systemic 
exposure as well as on dose, monkeys tolerated much lower doses than rat. Concerning the 
gastrointestinal targets, comparisons based on mg/m2 may be more relevant 
than systemic exposure levels and at the NOAEL multiples would approach x2-x3 the expected human 
values. It is notable that in monkey with increasing study duration from 14 days to 38 weeks tolerance 
appeared to decrease markedly in that a total dose of 4200 mg over 14 days was relatively well 
tolerated in contrast to a total dose of 3000 mg over approximately 55-59 days that was related to 
deaths in the 38 week study.  
Lamivudine 
Repeated dose toxicity of lamivudine after oral administration was studied in rats (up to 6 months) and 
dogs (up to 12 months). The target organ of toxicity was the haematopoietic system (anaemia, 
decreased platelet count, leukopenia and splenic hemosiderosis). Furthermore, following high doses 
and extended exposure periods, impaired liver function (raised ALT and AST without major histological 
effects), and gastrointestinal effects (ulcers, inflammation) were observed. Non observable effect level 
(NOEL) was 300-425 mg/kg/day b.i.d. in rats and <45 mg/kg/day b.i.d. in dogs. 
Combination abacavir + dolutegravir + lamivudine 
No non-clinical studies were performed with the combination abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine. 
The applicant refers to ICH guideline M3(R2) on non-clinical safety studies for the conduct of human 
clinical trials and marketing authorisation for pharmaceuticals (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995), stating that 
for most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical 
experience with co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended 
to support clinical studies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar 
target organ toxicity). With late stage experience is meant experience from Phase III studies and/or

(EMA/CHMP/ICH/507008/2001), regarding Combinations, question 9, in which is stated that 
combination toxicity studies on advanced cancer, tuberculosis, and HIV products are generally not 
warranted unless there is a specific cause for concern under clinically relevant conditions. 
Both abacavir and dolutegravir caused treatment-related hepatic effects, the findings in abacavir-
treated animals were believed to be adaptive changes related to metabolic enzyme induction, and with 
dolutegravir the findings were observed only at doses that exceeded the maximum tolerated dose (the 
liver effects hepatocellular single cell necrosis, diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy and elevated liver 
enzymes only occurred in the monkey 14 day toxicity study at doses that were not tolerated and 
exposures ~5 to 9X above the anticipated clinical exposure). Cumulative data suggest a hepatic safety 
profile for dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine that is comparable to the combination efavirenz + 
emtricitabine + tenofovir), raltegravir + abacavir/lamivudine and darunavir +ritonavir + 
abacavir/lamivudine. There were no other common target organs of toxicities identified for the 3 
compounds. The potential for additive or synergistic toxicity at clinically relevant concentrations is 
therefore considered low. 
Genotoxicity 
Abacavir 
Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial tests but showed activity in vitro in the human lymphocyte 
chromosome aberration assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, and the in vivo micronucleus test. This is 
consistent with the known activity of other nucleoside analogues. These results indicate that abacavir 
has a weak potential to cause chromosomal damage both in vitro and in vivo at high test 
concentrations. 
Dolutegravir 
Dolutegravir was tested in vitro for genotoxicity in a bacterial mutation assay and mouse lymphoma 
L5178Y cell assay up to cytotoxic concentrations. Negative results were reported except for a weakly 
positive result in the mouse lymphoma assay at high cytotoxicity. A previous non-GLP mouse 
lymphoma test was positive at high dose but cytotoxicity may have confounded results.  The in vivo rat 
micronucleus test was negative. Taken together the data did not indicate any relevant genotoxic 
potential of dolutegravir. 
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine was negative in the Ames test but induced gene mutations in the mouse lymphoma assay 
(at 1000 μg/ml and above). It was also clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenicity test in human 
lymphocytes at 300 μg/ml which is 150 times higher than the concentrations observed at clinical use. 
Lamivudine induced gene mutations in the mouse lymphoma assay (at 1000 μg/ml and above). It was 
also clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenicity test in human lymphocytes at 300 μg/ml which is 150 times 
higher than the concentrations observed at clinical use. In mouse embryo cells, lamivudine did not 
induce morphological transformation at concentrations up to 320 µg/ml without S9 or 5000 µg/ml with 
S9. In vivo, lamivudine was not clastogenic in the rat bone marrow metaphase analysis assay, the rat 
bone marrow micronucleus assay or the rat liver UDS assay following oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg. 
Combination abacavir + lamivudine 
A rat bone marrow micronucleus assay was performed (study R25531). Male rats were treated orally 
by gavage on two consecutive days with vehicle or left untreated, abacavir at 500, 1000, 2000 
mg/kg/day, lamivudine at 2000 mg/kg/day, abacavir/lamivudine at 500/2000, 1000/2000 or 
2000/2000 mg/kg/day or with cyclophosphamide at 20 mg/kg once (positive control). Signs of toxicity 
(among others decreased activity) were observed in animals receiving abacavir at 2000 mg/kg/day or 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 35/114 
 
  
  
in animals receiving abacavir/lamivudine 2000/2000 mg/kg/day. At the combination 2000/2000 
mg/kg/day, two animals died. No significant increase in micronucleated erythrocytes was observed.  
Carcinogenicity 
Abacavir 
An increased incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumours was noted, including in both species 
carcinoma in the preputial gland of males and in the clitorial gland of females. In female rats, 
carcinoma in the liver, urinary bladder, lymph nodes and subcutis hemangiosarcoma were observed. 
These neoplastic findings occurred at the highest doses tested: 330 mg/kg/day in mice and 600 
mg/kg/day in rats, with the exception of preputial gland carcinoma in male mice which occurred at 110 
mg/kg/day. These doses gave a systemic exposure of respectively around 24 fold and 33 fold higher 
than the expected exposure in humans treated with 600 mg/day. The non-effect dose levels were 55 
mg/kg/day in mice which corresponds to 3 times the human AUC in humans, and 120 mg/kg/day in 
rats, which corresponds to 7 times the AUC in humans. Furthermore, in the carcinogenicity studies in 
mice and rats, myocardial degeneration was observed at high dose. 
Dolutegravir 
Long term carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mouse and rat. Overall dolutegravir did not 
exhibit any significant neoplastic activity in either study. There were some apparent increases in 
tumours of the kidney, liver and urinary bladder in mouse when compared with vehicle control, but not 
when considering water control. Similarly in rat there were some increases such as hyperplasia of the 
non-glandular stomach, hepatocellular adenoma in high dose animals, but there was no dose-response 
and incidences were within historical values and likely the relevance of these findings is limited.  In rat, 
3 oligodendrogliomas, a rare neoplastic finding, were reported at mid dose. Exposure at the high dose 
was only 2.1 to 1.6 fold higher than at mid dose. However, the data taken together are consistent with 
a lack of any clinically relevant carcinogenicity of dolutegravir. 
Lamivudine 
The carcinogenic potential of lamivudine was studied in conventional 24 months studies in rats and 
mice. No signs of carcinogenic effects were seen. In these studies, the systemic exposure of animals 
was 10 - 58 higher than the systemic exposure of humans at clinical use. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive toxicity studies were performed with the combination abacavir / dolutegravir / 
lamivudine. 
Complete packages of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed for all 
compounds. Abacavir was teratogenic but dolutegravir and lamivudine were not. Aggravation of 
reproductive toxicity due to the combination is not expected. Additional studies with the combination 
are not warranted. 
Local Tolerance  
Abacavir 
Abacavir did not induce skin or eye irritancy. 
Dolutegravir 
Local tolerance studies conducted in vitro and in vivo showed that dolutegravir had mild irritant effects 
on abraded skin and slight ocular irritating effects that were reduced with rinsing after exposure.  
Assessment report

Lamivudine 
Lamivudine did not induce skin or eye irritancy. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Abacavir 
Abacavir did not induce sensitization in guinea pigs using the Magnusson and Kligman Maximisation 
test. 
Dolutegravir 
Dolutegravir was non-sensitizing in the mouse local lymph node assay. 
Lamivudine 
Lamivudine did not induce skin sensitising or antigenic potential. 
Immunotoxicity 
Dolutegravir 
A dedicated 1 month immunotoxicity study in rat given oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg did not indicate 
any important effects on T-cell dependent antibody formation. An increase in spleen weight was noted, 
but with no accompanying histopathological changes. In a 2 week monkey study spleen atrophy of 
white pulp was reported at a dose of 1000 mg/kg. Data from the separate juvenile toxicity study that 
included immunological endpoints did not suggest any particular developmental immunotoxicity of 
dolutegravir. Overall based on non-clinical data the potential for immunotoxicity would appear a minor 
concern. 
Mitochondrial toxicity studies 
Abacavir and lamivudine showed a very low cytotoxic potential. Abacavir and lamivudine did not 
change the mitochondrial content or change lactate production, cell growth, glucose consumption and 
LDH leakage in a human leukaemic cell line.  
Phototoxicity 
In the registration procedure for dolutegravir, a post-authorisation measure is proposed that 
phototoxicity should be investigated. Dolutegravir absorbs light in the wavelength of 290-700 nm and 
a rat distribution study showed that drug-related material reaches the uveal tract as well as the skin 
(mainly the pigmented skin) where it is still quantifiable at up to 7 and 28 days -post-dose. 
Abacavir and lamivudine do not absorb light in the 290 to 700 nm wavelength range. Phototoxicity 
studies have therefore not been performed with abacavir and lamivudine. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dolutegravir 
The ERA dossier for dolutegravir is complete. Dolutegravir is not PBT, nor vPvB. 
On the basis of the environmental risk assessment, it is concluded that the use of dolutegravir in 
Triumeq results in negligible risk for the sewage treatment plant, the surface water, groundwater, soil 
and sediment compartment.

Dolutegravir, abacavir or lamivudine are not PBT substances. Updated Environmental Risk 
Assessments were provided for acabavir and lamivudine. Dolutegravir is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. The available data do not allow concluding definitively on the potential risk of 
abacavir or lamivudine to the environment. Additional studies are required, please refer to section 
2.3.5. The Applicant will submit the final reports two years following approval. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The DTG/ABC/3TC FDC development program consisted of one pivotal study and five supportive 
studies that provided safety and efficacy data on this combination medicinal product. These studies 
were conducted in the intended populations, and they provide data from subjects taking all three 
DTG/ABC/3TC FDC components concomitantly and/or DTG + 2 NRTIs (or at least 1 fully-active agent 
in the case of the ART-experienced, INI-naive study ING111762). These studies are: 
• 
• 
• 
ING114467 (SINGLE), which is also part of the DTG single entity development program, is 
considered the pivotal DTG/ABC/3TC FDC study because this trial evaluated a regimen of once-
daily DTG 50 mg + ABC/3TC 600/300 mg FDC as one of two randomized study treatments. 
ING113086 (SPRING-2), ING114915 (FLAMINGO), and ING112276 (SPRING-1), which are clinical 
studies within the DTG single entity development program, are considered supportive in 
demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC as they all include subjects 
administered once-daily ABC/3TC 600/300 mg FDC as a background treatment option in 
combination with DTG 50 mg once daily. 
ING116070 (CSF Study) and ING111762 (SAILING), which are clinical studies within the DTG 
single entity development program, are considered supportive in demonstrating the safety and 
efficacy of the DTG 50 mg tablet in combination with ABC/3TC or other active antiretroviral drugs. 
The numbers of subjects from these studies contributing data for once daily DTG 50 mg + 
ABC/3TC 600/300 mg are small for both of these studies. 
Five other studies are considered a part of the clinical development of the individual DTG/ABC/3TC FDC 
components, including: 
ING111521 provided proof of concept (POC) for the DTG component and was included in the original 
DTG submission. 
CNA30021, EPV20001, EPV40001, and COLA4005 supported regulatory submissions for the approval of 
once daily dosing of ABC 600 mg or 3TC 300 mg. Other studies (CAL30001, ESS30008, EPZ104057, 
CNA109586, and COL101004) conducted with the ABC/3TC FDC were provided as relevant background 
information. 
Finally, clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to bridge between the various formulations 
over time and form an important component to support the efficacy and safety of DTG/ABC/3TC FDC. 
Underpinning all the clinical efficacy studies is the bioequivalence (BE) study ING114580, establishing 
that the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet is bioequivalent to DTG+ABC/3TC FDC administered concomitantly.

applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
As  part  of  the  assessment  of  Dolutegravir  single  entity,  a  request  for  GCP  inspection  has  been 
adopted for the clinical studies ING112574 (SAILING) and ING113086 (SPRING-2). These studies are 
also  part  of  the  dossier  for  the  FDC.  Based  on  the  quality  identified  in  these  two  clinical  sites  and 
sponsor  site  inspections  it  is  likely  that  the  deviations  and  findings  identified  during  the  inspections 
did not in any major sense influence or change the results as they were presented in the final study 
report of DTG single entity. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK properties of the individual components DTG (Tivicay) and ABC/3TC (Kivexa) have been subject 
to comprehensive development programs to support their respective Marketing Authorisations. The 
development strategy for the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet focused on the compatibility of the active 
ingredients with each other and with the other excipients of the formulation. In addition, the program 
for the FDC aimed to demonstrate bioequivalence between the FDC tablet and the concurrently 
administered individual dosage forms, i.e. DTG (Tivicay) and ABC/3TC (Kivexa). 
During development of the FDC, a Phase I bioavailability study (study ING114581) has been carried 
out using two different tablet formulations of DTG/ABC/3TC tablets. Based upon the results of this 
study, the so-called Formulation 1 was optimised to obtain the proposed commercial formulation. A 
pivotal bioequivalence and food effect study with the DTG/ABC/3TC 50/600/300mg FDC tablet versus

and the separate co-administered tablet formulations of DTG 50 mg plus EPZICOM (ABC 600 mg/3TC 
300 mg) was carried out to proof bioequivalence between the FDC tablet and the separate co-
administered tablet formulations (ING114580). 
No other clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC formulation 
proposed for marketing. Statements regarding the FDC are based on the clinical pharmacology of the 
individual components.  
Furthermore, the outcome of the clinical pharmacology studies with DTG, ABC or 3TC (the individual 
components of DTG/ABC/3TC FDC) are summarised.  
Analytical methods 
For the analysis of DTG, ABC and 3TC in study ING114581 and ING114580, LC-MS/MS methods were 
applied. 
Dolutegravir 
Validation: 
DTG was extracted from plasma by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. The calibration curve range 
from 20 – 20000 ng/ml. Within-run and between run precision and accuracy were within normal 
criteria. Stability has been proven over the handling and storage conditions of study samples, e.g. 5 
freeze/thaw cycles at -20ºC and -70ºC, long term stability over 257 days at -20ºC and -70ºC, long 
term stability over 373 days at -20ºC, short term stability at room temperature for about 26 h,

For study ING114580, ABC was simultaneous analysed with 3TC. The calibration curve range from 2.5 
– 2500 ng/ml. Within-run and between run precision and accuracy were within normal criteria. Stability 
has been proven over the handling and storage conditions of study samples, e.g. 5 freeze/thaw cycles, 
long term stability over 212 days at -20ºC and -70ºC, short term stability at room temperature for 
about 29 h, wet extract stability for 90 h at 5ºC and whole blood stability at 37ºC for 4 h. 
Analysis of study samples: 
Study ING114581:  
The precision of the QCs for ABC ranged from 3.4% to 6.2% while the accuracy ranged from 96.8% to 
103.5%. Within-run criteria were met. 39 samples were reanalysed due to concentration >ULOQ, and 
4 upon client request. Regarding the latter, for 2 samples the original value was kept. For the other 2 
samples the repeated value (i.e. BLQ). As this is not the pivotal study, no concern will be raised.     
Study IND114580: 
The precision of the QCs for ABC ranged from 3.4% to 6.7% while the accuracy ranged from 97.0% to 
103.2%. Within-run criteria were met. Samples had to be reanalysed due to concentration > ULOQ and 
concentration < LLOQ (n=1).

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Pharmacokinetic variables, e.g. AUC0-t, AUCinf, Cmax, Cmin, t max, and t ½ were calculated according to 
standard procedures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014

The population pharmacokinetic analysis, was performed separately for HIV-Infected Treatment-Naive 
and HIV-1 Infected Treatment-Experienced adult patients using pooled data from phase 2 and phase 3 
studies. PopPK modeling was carried out using NONMEM 7 with FOCE-I as estimation method. 
Statistical analysis 
For comparison in most cases the 90% confidence intervals were calculated in case of equivalence 
testing. In addition, in case significance levels were used, the significance level was normally 5%.  
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
DTG, ABC and 3TC are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of 
DTG has not been established. In the single dose mass balance study (ING111853), 31.6% of the 
administered dose was recovered in urine indicating that at least 1/3 of the dose is absorbed 
systemically.  
The absolute bioavailability of oral ABC and 3TC in adults is 83% and 80 to 85% respectively. The 
mean time to maximal serum concentrations (t max) is about 2 to 3 hours (post dose for tablet 
formulation), 1.5 hours and 1.0 hours for DTG, ABC and 3TC respectively. 
At steady state, the Cmax and AUC0-24h of DTG 50 mg once daily is 3.67 µ/ml and 53.6 µg.h/ml, 
respectively. Following a single oral dose of 600 mg of ABC, the mean Cmax is 4.26 µg/ml and the mean 
AUC0-inf is 11.95 µg.h/ml. Following multiple-dose oral administration of 3TC 300 mg once daily for 
seven days the mean steady-state Cmax is 2.04 µg/ml and the mean AUC0-24h is 8.87 µg.h/ml. 
Study ING114581: 
This was a single dose, randomised, 3 period crossover study evaluating the relative bioavailability of 
two experimental fixed-dose combination tablet formulations of DTG/ABC/3TC 50mg/600mg/300 mg 
compared to co-administered DTG 50 mg and abacavir/3TC (ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg) tablets in 
healthy adult subjects. The formulations were administered under fasted conditions. The washout 
period between periods was 7 days. Blood samples were taken up to 48 h after administration of the 
formulation. 
18 subjects (8 females and 10 males), aged 19 – 45 years, were included in the study and completed 
the study.  
The following formulations were administered:

the clinical effect and safety studies. The Epzicom tablet (marketed in US and Japan) used in the BE 
study is identical to the Kivexa tablet which is marketed in EU. One bioequivalence study has been 
conducted specific to the ABC/3TC/DTG FDC program (ING114580)  
ING114580: Bioequivalence between the fixed dose combination tablet (TRIUMEQ) and the fixed dose 
combination ABC/3TC (EPZICOM/KIVEXA) administrated together with individual tablet of DTG 
(TIVICAY) was evaluated in a single-dose (fasting condition), randomized, two-treatment sequences 
(AB, BA), crossover study conducted in healthy male and female subjects (n=62 evaluated in 
pharmacokinetic analysis). In the second part (n=12), the effect of food on the FDC tablet was 
investigated. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and up to 48 h post-dose. Plasma concentrations 
were determined with two LC-MS/MS methods (dolutegravir separately and abacavir/lamivudine was 
co-analysed). For AUC(0-∞), AUC0-t and Cmax the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and 
reference products fell within the conventional acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%.

Table 12.  Study part B - Statistical comparison of DTG, ABC and 3TC pharmacokinetic 
parameters for food effect assessment 
The results from the statistical comparisons for DTG showed that plasma exposures following 
administration of the FDC tablet formulation administered with a high fat meal were approximately 
48% higher for AUC and 37% higher for Cmax than following administration of the FDC tablet 
formulation in the fasted condition. 
For both ABC and 3TC, the results from the statistical analyses indicate that plasma exposures from 
the FDC tablet formulation administered with a high fat meal were similar to those from administration 
in the fasted condition, although the Cmax for ABC was approximately 23% lower when the FDC tablet 
was taken with food. 
Distribution 
Abacavir. Following intravenous administration, the apparent volume of distribution is about 0.8 L/kg. 
In vitro, the plasma protein binding at therapeutic concentrations is 49%. Studies with abacavir 
demonstrate a CSF to plasma AUC ratio of between 30 to 44%.    
Lamivudine. From intravenous studies the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 L/kg. Lamivudine exhibits 
linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and binding to serum albumin in vitro is <16-
36%. The mean ratio of CSF/serum lamivudine concentrations 2-4 hours after oral administration was 
approximately 12%. 
Dolutegravir. Plasma protein binding of DTG was approximately 99.3% and independent of 
concentration over the therapeutic range based on in vitro data. In the hepatic impairment study the 
unbound fraction (fu) of DTG increased with decreasing serum albumin concentration, while there was 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 51/114 
 
  
  
 
 
no evident trend in the relation between fu and α1-acid glycoprotein. The blood-plasma ratio was in the 
range 0.44 to 0.54.Based on the population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) in 
patients was determined to be 17 to 20 L. DTG is distributed to CSF and the resulting steady state 
concentration is similar to the unbound concentration in plasma. In healthy volunteers (human ADME 
study, oral 20 mg, suspension) Vd/F (CV%) was determined to 12.5 L (9%).   
Metabolism 
Abacavir. The primary metabolism pathways are by alcohol dehydrohgenase and by glucuronidation to 
produce the 5’-carboxylic acid and 5’-glucuronide which account for about 66% of the dose. These 
metabolites are excreted in the urine. The PK profile of intracellular active anabolite carbovir 
triphosphate (TP) following administration of an abacavir 300 mg BID containing regimen in HIV 
infected patients was characterised. This study demonstrated carbovir-TP has an intracellular half-life 
of 20.6 h. 
Lamivudine. Metabolism is a minor route of elimination of lamivudine. The extent of hepatic 
metabolism is low (5-10%). The active moiety, intracellular lamivudine-TP, has a terminal half-life in 
the cell (16 to 19 hours) compared to the plasma lamivudine half-life (5 to 7 h) after 300 mg once 
daily. 
Dolutegravir. DTG is metabolised by UGT1A1 and also to some extent by CYP3A4 (~10% of dose in 
mass balance study). The fraction in urine was represented by ether glucuronide of dolutegravir 
(18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and a metabolite formed by 
oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating 
compound in plasma. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Abacavir. The mean half-life of ABC was about 1.5 h. Approximately 2% of the administrated dose was 
renally exctreded as unchanged compound. Unchanged ABC and metabolites thereof accounted for 
about 83% of the administered dose in urine, the remaining was eliminated in faeces.    
Lamivudine. Lamivudine was predominately cleared by renal excretion as unchanged compound. The 
mean systemic clearance was approximately 0.32 L/h/kg, with renal clearance (~70%) via the organic 
cationic transport system.  The observed lamivudine elimination half-life was 5-7 h. 
Dolutegravir. Based on the population PK analysis, CL/F and half-life in patients was determined to be 
approximately 1 L/h and 12 h, respectively. Based on phase I meta-analysis in healthy volunteers the 
corresponding data was 1.14 L/h and 14.4 h, respectively. 
In the human mass balance study the total mean recovery of the administered radioactive dose was 
96%, with relative recovery of 64% in faeces (94% of radioactivity assigned) and 32% in urine (87% 
assigned). Unchanged DTG constitutes the major part of the radioactivity excreted in faeces (53% of 
the dose). Virtually no DTG (<1% of dose) was excreted unchanged in the urine. It is likely that the 
major part of the DTG recovered in faeces originates from biliary excreted glucuronide conjugate, 
which has been converted back to parent in the gut lumen. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of studies ING111521, ING112276 and ING113086 suggested a 
less than dose-proportional increase in DTG exposure between 10 mg and 25 mg but a dose-
proportional increase between 25 mg and 50 mg.

Page 52/114 
 
  
  
A phase 1 study was performed in HV with the aim to evaluate the effect of rifampin and rifabutin on 
DTG PK (ING113099). As part of the study 50 mg DTG was administered both once and twice daily to 
the same subject. Following 7 days repeated dosing exposure over 24 hours was determined. The 
geometric mean exposure to DTG in terms of AUC0-24 was 32 µg*h/mL and 93 µg*h/mL for once and 
twice daily dosing, respectively. 
Time dependency 
After administration of multiple once daily doses (study ING111322), the accumulation index for AUC 
was 1.4 for the 10 mg and 50 mg doses and 1.2 for the 25 mg dose. The ratio of AUCτ on Day 10 to 
AUC(0-inf) on Day 1 was 1.06 and 1.01 for the 10 mg and 50 mg doses, respectively, with 95% 
confidence intervals being within 0.8-1.25 for both dose groups. For the 25 mg group the ratio 
[95%CI] was estimated to 0.892 [0.841-0.946]. 
Abacavir and lamivudine show no unexpected steady state data. 
Special populations 
No clinically relevant effect on the PK of race, gender and weight was observed for any of the three 
active components. There is limited data in elderly patients for all three active components. In children 
above 12 years of age, the exposure was comparable to those observed in adults for all three 
compounds. In a meta-analysis using pharmacogenetic samples from healthy volunteers (n=89), the 
influence of UGT1A1 polymorphism on the DTG exposure was investigated. The AUCτ of DTG in 
subjects with the low function (*28/*28, *28/*37) and reduced function (e.g. *1/*28, *28/*36) of the 
UGT1A1 enzyme, increased by 46% and 17%, respectively. This is considered not to be clinical 
relevant.  
Impaired renal function 
Abacavir. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir in patients with end-stage renal disease is similar to 
patients with normal renal function. 
Lamivudine. Studies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients 
with renal dysfunction due to decreased clearance. Dose reduction is required for patients with 
creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/min. 
Dolutegravir. Exposure to DTG was 40% lower in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 16 to 28 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to healthy controls. The mechanism for the decrease is 
unknown.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Abacavir. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh score 5-6) receiving a single 600 mg dose. The results showed that there was a mean 
increase of 1.89 fold [1.32; 2.70] in the abacavir AUC, and 1.58 [1.22; 2.04] fold in the elimination 
half-life. No recommendation on dose reduction is possible in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
due to substantial variability of abacavir exposure.  
Lamivudine. The PK profile of 3TC is not significantly affected in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Dolutegravir. The unbound clearance of DTG was reduced by 35% to 50% in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment (HI) leading to an approximate 1.5 to 2-fold increase in unbound exposure to DTG. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 53/114 
 
  
  
No dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild to moderate HI. The effect of severe 
hepatic impairment on PK of DTG has not been studied. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction study has been performed with the FDC tablet and no specific DDI study to investigate 
potential interaction between the three compounds has been performed. Interaction studies have been 
performed with the individual components dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine and any interaction 
identified for these individually are also relevant to Triumeq.  
Abacavir. CYP450 does not play a major role in the metabolism of abacavir. In vitro, abacavir has been 
shown to not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2D6 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Induction of hepatic metabolism has not been observed in clinical studies. Potent enzymatic inducers 
such as rifampicin, phenobarbital and phenytoin may via their action on UDP-glucuronyltransferases 
slightly decrease the plasma concentrations of abacavir, but are not expected to clinically impact on 
the exposure levels of abacavir. Two in vivo interaction studies has been performed: one with 
zidovudine and lamivudine and the second with alcohol. The results of those studies did not justify any 
specific dose recommendations. In the interaction study with ethanol AUC of abacavir was increased by 
41%. Retinoid compounds are eliminated via alcohol dehydrogenase and interaction with abacavir is 
possible but has not been studied. Abacavir is not a substrate of the transporter P-glycoprotein. 
However, the investigated concentrations were lower than the maximal intestinal concentrations and it 
is therefore unknown if abacavir is a substrate for P-glycoprotein in the intestine. Literature data 
indicate that abacavir is a substrate for P-glycoprotein at intestinal concentrations. No other 
transporter information was provided for abacavir.  
Lamivudine. Lamivudine is not significantly metabolised by CYP450 enzymes (such as CYP3A4, 2C9 
and 2D6) nor does it inhibit or induce this enzyme system. In vitro, Lamivudine has been found to be 
an OCT2 substrate. Administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg results in a 43% 
increase in lamivudine exposure, because of the trimethoprim component (a known OCT2 and MATE1 
inhibitor); the sulfamethoxazole component did not interact.  
Dolutegravir. DTG is a substrate of UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 as well as of the transporter proteins P-pg and 
BCRP. No mechanistic in vivo studies aimed to investigate the relative importance of the elimination 
pathways have been performed, however a number of co-medications commonly used in clinical 
practice have been studied. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No other clinical pharmacology study has been conducted with the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC formulation 
proposed for marketing besides a pivotal bioequivalence and food effect study with the DTG/ABC/3TC 
FDC as described before. Statements regarding the FDC are based on the clinical pharmacology of the 
individual components. 
Mechanism of action 
DTG Component 
DTG inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step 
of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. In 
vitro, DTG dissociates slowly from the active site of the wild type integrase-DNA complex (t½ 71 hours). 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 54/114 
 
  
  
ABC and 3TC Component 
ABC and 3TC are NRTIs, and are potent, selective inhibitors of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Both ABC and 3TC are 
metabolized sequentially by intracellular kinases to the respective triphosphate (TP) which are the 
active moieties and display extended intracellular half-lives supporting once daily use. 3TC-TP and 
carbovir-TP (the active triphosphate form of ABC) are substrates for and competitive inhibitors of HIV 
reverse transcriptase (RT). However, their main antiviral activity is through incorporation of the 
monophosphate form into the viral DNA chain, resulting in chain termination. ABC and 3TC 
triphosphates show significantly less affinity for host cell DNA polymerases. 
Effect on cardiac conduction  
DTG Component 
In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial (study ING111856), 42 healthy subjects received 
single dose oral administrations of placebo, a supratherapeutic dose of DTG at 250 mg as suspension 
(exposures approximately 2-3-fold of the 50 mg twice daily dose at steady state), and moxifloxacin 
(400 mg, active control) in random sequence. DTG did not prolong the QTc interval for 24 hours post 
dose. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTc change based on Fridericia 
correction method (QTcF) was 1.99 msec (1-sided 95% upper CI: 4.53 msec). 
ABC and 3TC Component 
There was no requirement to conduct thorough QTc studies at the time of development and 
registration of the marketed ABC- and 3TC- containing products. AE preferred terms indicative of 
clinical manifestations of TdP are not listed in the Company RSI or any approved local country labelling 
for ABC/3TC or the individual single entities ABC and 3TC. There is no evidence for risk of TdP for ABC 
and 3TC base on non-clinical data. 
Effect on renal function  
The effect of DTG on serum creatinine clearance (CrCL), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using iohexol 
as the probe, and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) using paraaminohippurate (PAH) as the probe 
was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, 3 arm, parallel, placebo-controlled study (study 
ING114819) in 37 healthy subjects, who were administered DTG 50 mg once daily (n=12), 50 mg 
twice daily (n=13) or placebo once daily (n=12) for 14 days. A modest decrease (about 10%) in CrCL 
was observed with DTG within the first week of treatment, consistent with that seen in clinical studies. 
DTG at both doses had no significant effect on actual GFR or ERPF. These data support findings from  
in vitro studies which suggest that the small increases in creatinine observed in clinical studies are due 
to the likely benign inhibition of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) in the proximal renal tubules, 
which mediates the tubular secretion of creatinine. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
Before initiating treatment with ABC, screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele should be 
performed in any HIV-infected patients. Screening is also recommended prior to re-initiation of 
abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. Abacavir 
should not be used in patients known to carry the HLA-B*5701 allele as carriage of this allele is 
associated with a significantly increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. This restriction 
also applies to the FDC tablet.

Resistance profile 
A dual nucleoside backbone plus a third potent drug is the standard of care in antiretroviral naive HIV 
positive patients. As the potency and barrier to resistance of the third drug in the combination 
increases (ie, NNRTI to PI to INI), the percent of protocol defined virologic failures (PDVFs) decreases 
as does the incidence of resistance to the nucleoside backbone and to the third drug. The combination 
of ABC + 3TC has proven efficacy when used as a nucleoside backbone for third drugs of multiple 
classes. While 3TC and ABC each select for M184V, this mutation alone does not cause high level 
resistance to ABC and antiretroviral activity is preserved unless additional mutations in the RT gene 
occur. The combination of ABC + 3TC has a well-defined and clinically robust resistance profile. 
In the four studies of antiretroviral naive subjects, DTG + ABC/3TC resulted in a very low number of 
PDVF; none of these subjects had resistance to either DTG or to ABC/3TC. This is consistent with the 
evidence of higher barrier to resistance for DTG shown by the lower frequency of emergent INI 
resistance against DTG compared with RAL in both treatment naive and treatment experienced, but INI 
naive subjects. Protection of the nucleoside backbone and associated preservation of antiretroviral 
agents for future regimen options is a hallmark of an antiviral agent with a high barrier to resistance. 
Nonclinical Virology 
The following information is based on what is known from the individual components and briefly 
summarized. 
Dolutegravir (DTG) inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the 
strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. It has 
low nM activity against wild type HIV-1 and HIV-2 in a variety of cells lines, regardless of subtype. 
Human serum (100%) causes approximately 75-fold increase in DTG IC50. DTG is additive or 
synergistic when assayed in combination with other antiretroviral agents. 
Susceptibilities to DTG and raltegravir (RAL) were obtained from 60 RAL resistant site directed HIV-1 
mutants and 6 site directed HIV-2 mutants. DTG retained activity against a vast majority of these 
mutants (95% had <10 FC to DTG). Additionally, susceptibilities to DTG and RAL were determined for 
over 700 RAL resistant clinical isolates, with DTG retaining activity (<10 FC) against >90% of them. 
The dissociation of DTG, RAL, and EVG from wild type and mutant IN proteins complexed with DNA 
was investigated to obtain a better understanding of INI resistance and dissociation kinetics. DTG 
demonstrated slower dissociation from all IN-DNA complexes tested, including those with single, 
double, and up to four residues clinically relevant IN substitutions. 
Analysis of site directed mutants at IN polymorphic sites (101 and 124) as either single or double 
mutants, demonstrated no effect on DTG susceptibility. 
Abacavir (ABC) has shown antiviral activity in vitro, with synergistic activity when combined with 3TC. 
ABC selects for RT mutations M184V, K65R, L74V, and Y115F in vitro.  
Lamivudine (3TC) is a potent and selective inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in vitro and appears 
to show synergistic antiviral activity in vitro in combination with AZT, ABC, or other inhibitors such as 
the protease inhibitor Saquinavir. It has been shown to be metabolised intracellularly to the 5'-
triphosphate which has a long half-life of 10.5 to 15.5 hours. 3TC 5'-triphosphate inhibits HIV-1 RT 
with a Ki of 12.3 µM, and but its major action is as a chain terminator of reverse transcription. 3TC 5'-
triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of DNA polymerase α, ß and γ, hence, there is little predicted toxic 
effect on human cell lines.

Clinical Virology 
DTG Treatment-naïve population 
DTG + ABC/3TC demonstrated long term durability in ING114467 (SINGLE) with a low rate of 
discontinuation due to virologic failure through 96 weeks. No treatment emergent primary INI or NRTI 
resistance mutations were observed through 96 weeks in ING114467 (SINGLE) for those subjects on 
DTG plus ABC/3TC FDC with PDVF. In contrast, both EFV and NRTI primary resistance mutations were 
observed in subjects on Atripla with PDVF. 
Overall, there was a low rate of discontinuation in ING113086 (SPRING-2) due to virologic failure in 
both treatment arms (DTG or RAL plus 2 NRTIs), with only three additional subjects with PDVF 
identified after Week 48. The durability of the virologic response on DTG and RAL was maintained 
through Week 96. No treatment emergent primary INI or NRTI resistance mutations were observed for 
those subjects on DTG with PDVF throughout the study. 
No treatment-emergent Primary INI or NRTI resistance mutations were observed for subjects in the 
DTG or Darunavir plus ritonavir (DRV+RTV) treatment groups of ING114915 (FLAMINGO).  
DTG Treatment-experienced population 
DTG in combination with various backbone regimens (n=8 ABC/3TC) exhibits a higher barrier to 
treatment failure than RAL in the study of treatment experienced, INI naive subjects, ING111762 
(SAILING); there was a statistically significant difference in favor of DTG for the proportion of subjects 
who failed therapy with treatment-emergent evidence of INI resistance through Week 48. A unique IN 
substitution was observed (R263K or R263R/K mixture) in 2 subjects (one receiving EFV and TDF and 
the other receiving DRV/r and TDF as their background regimens) enrolled in ING111762 (SAILING) 
with little change in susceptibility to DTG and to RAL. 
ABC and 3TC 
For ABC, significant breakpoints were identified for both the AntivirogramTM and the PhenoSenseTM 
HIV assays. For the PhenoSenseTM HIV assay, breakpoints were identified at 4.4-fold and 6.3-fold. 
Breakpoints for the AntivirogramTM assay were slightly different (3.2- and 7.5-fold). In general the 
number of mutations correlated very closely with phenotype. The M184V mutation alone had no 
discernible effect on the response to ABC for subjects enrolled in five clinical trials (Glaxo Wellcome 
studies CNA2003, CNA3001, CNA3002, CNA3003 and CNA3009) versus those entering with wildtype 
virus, with 88% of subjects with M184V viruses responding at week 4. The M184V mutation in isolation 
has a negligible effect on ABC efficacy. 
ABC/3TC plus a potent third agent results in very low incidence of M184V and only very rarely L74V or 
K65R (the latter two are ABC-associated resistance mutations) in ART naive subjects with PDVF. 
Increased potency of the third agent results in reduced incidence of PDVF and reduced treatment 
emergent mutations in those subjects with PDVF. 
3TC selects rapidly for M184V which causes high level resistance to 3TC, reverses the effects of AZT 
resistance mutations, and delays the appearance of AZT resistance mutations. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence 
Bioequivalence between Triumeq FDC and Tivicay and Epzicom/Kivexa administered as mono-
components has been demonstrated which is crucial in order to bridge from the monotherapy tablet of 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 57/114 
 
  
  
Tivicay and FDC Epzicom/Kivexa used in the clinical effect and safety studies. The bioequivalence study 
was adequately designed.  
Effect of food 
The effect of food on Triumeq has been sufficiently evaluated. For DTG a larger food effect on exposure 
has previously been reported for Tivicay (ca. 70% increase with a high fat meal) compared to what 
was found with the Triumeq FDC (40-50% increase). DTG can be taken with or without food according 
to the Tivicay SmPC, i.e. this discrepancy is considered to be of minor importance. The food effect on 
ABC and 3TC for Triumeq was roughly similar as previously reported for Kivexa. Also Kivexa can be 
taken regardless of food according to the SmPC. Triumeq can be taken with or without food according 
to the proposed SmPC recommendation, which is adequate. 
Interactions 
Abacavir and lamivudine were approved as mono therapy compounds for more than 10 years ago and 
therefore the interaction potential of these has not been evaluated in compliance with the current 
Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev.1, 2012). However, the 
non-compliance is acceptable based on long clinical experience and no evident negative effects related 
to metabolizing enzyme or transporter interactions has been identified.   
In a FDC application the interaction between the substances should be considered and appropriate data 
should be submitted to either exclude PK interaction or establish magnitude of the interaction(s) 
(Guideline on clinical development of fixed combination medical products, CHMP/EWP/240/95 rev.1). 
The Applicant has not performed any specific DDI study to investigate potential interaction between 
the three compounds. Based on in vitro data, there is a risk for clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions due to inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1 by DTG and thus this includes the OCT2 substrate 
lamivudine. The approach of not conducting a specific DDI study between the components of the FDC 
was justified with a cross study comparison. The exposure was found to be similar for both abacavir 
and lamivudine independent of DTG administration. In addition, safety data from phase III trials 
supported the absence of clinically relevant DDI; Treatment related AEs were not more frequent with 
the TRIUMEQ combination, as compared to what was seen with abacavir/lamivudine combined with 
raltegravir or darunavir/r. Thus, there seem to be no effect on PK of lamivudine or abacavir by 
dolutegravir. The inhibition of OCT2 and MATE-1 by dolutegravir is acceptably reflected in the SmPC 
section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 and also for lamivudine as an OCT2 substrate in 4.5.  
There are no known mechanistic reasons for a PK drug-drug interaction affecting DTG due to co-
medication with ABC and 3TC. In addition, as discussed above there is no safety issues identified with 
the combination in the clinical studies. Thus the risk of any clinical relevant PK interaction caused by 
ABC and 3TC on the exposure of DTG is considered low. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of the new fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet has been established to a 
sufficient extent.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The new single tablet regimen (STR) being developed is a FDC of DTG 50 mg + ABC 600 mg + 3TC 
300 mg with once-daily dosing for antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve and ART-experienced (INI-naïve) 
patients, and is referred to in this document as the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 58/114 
 
  
  
No efficacy and safety studies were performed with DTG/ABC/3TC FDC. The bioequivalence study 
ING114580 is considered pivotal for the FDC tablet to allow bridging of efficacy and safety data 
obtained with the loose combination. For the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC development program, the main 
supportive study is study ING114467 (SINGLE, ART-naïve patients, 96 weeks) in which all patients 
used the backbone of interest. Supportive data are available from studies ING113086 (SPRING-2, ART-
naïve patients, 96 weeks), and ING114915 (FLAMINGO, ART-naïve patients, 48 weeks) in which a 
subgroup of patients used DTG in combination with ABC/3TC. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The doses selected for the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet (i.e., 50 mg/600 mg/300 mg) were based on the 
doses previously selected for once-daily dosing of DTG, ABC, and 3TC. DTG 50 mg once-daily is the 
dose that was recently approved in the EU (21 November 2013, CHMP approval) and already approved 
in the US for ART-naïve and ART-experienced, INI-naïve populations. ABC 600 mg and 3TC 300 mg are 
the approved once-daily doses in the intended populations, and these are also the approved doses for 
the FDC of ABC/3TC. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
ING114467 (SINGLE), which is also part of the DTG single entity development program, is 
considered the main supportive DTG/ABC/3TC FDC efficacy study because this trial evaluated a 
regimen of once-daily DTG 50 mg + ABC/3TC 600/300 mg FDC as one of two randomized study 
treatments. Study design and week 48 data (primary efficacy endpoint) were assessed within the 
dossier for the DTG single entity. The current submission also includes data until week 96. 
This was a multicenter study conducted in US, Canada, EU and Australia. The study started 01 Feb 
2011 and is ongoing. 
Title of Study 
Study ING114467 (SINGLE): A Phase III, randomized, double-blind study of the safety and efficacy 
of DTG plus abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy administered once 
daily compared to Atripla over 96 weeks in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy naive adult subjects. 
Diagnosis and study entry criteria

Treatment 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive double blinded DTG 50 mg plus ABC/3TC FDC therapy once 
daily or Atripla once daily along with the corresponding matching placebo tablets during the 
randomized phase (i.e. through their week 96 study visit). Subjects were stratified by screening HIV- 
1 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and CD4 cell count.  
Since Atripla is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach preferably at bedtime, all three 
blinded tablets were also recommended to be taken in this manner. Upon completion of the week 96 
visit subjects were given the opportunity to continue to receive treatment during the open-Label 
phase of the trial. 
Objectives  
Primary objective: To demonstrate non-inferior (non-inferiority margin 10%) antiviral activity of DTG 
plus ABC/3TC FDC once daily therapy compared to Atripla over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected ART-naïve 
subjects.  
Secondary objectives: 
•  Antiviral activity over 96 weeks; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
tolerability, long-term safety and antiviral and immunologic activity over time; 
development of viral resistance in subjects experiencing virological failure; 
health outcomes based on symptom bother count; 
incidence of HIV-associated conditions; 
health related quality of life. 
Primary and secondary endpoints 
The primary endpoint for this study was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL 
through Week 48 using the Missing, Switch, or Discontinuation = Failure (snapshot algorithm).  
Key secondary endpoints included the time to viral suppression (<50 copies/mL), the change from 
baseline in CD4 at Week 48, and the change in symptom bother count from baseline to week 4 of the 
Symptom Distress Module (SDM, also referred to as “Symptoms Impact Questionnaire”).  
For subjects confirmed as virological failures, viral genotyping and phenotyping analyses were 
conducted to explore the relationship between treatment with DTG + ABC/3TC and Atripla and the 
evolution of HIV-1 resistance.  
Health outcomes were assessed by two summary scores estimated from the HIV Symptom Index 
(Symptom Distress Module also known as the HIV Symptom Impact Questionnaire). In addition, the 
EQ-5D scale was also used, which rates patient’s health status on 5 dimensions of health (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). A utility score was estimated by 
combining scores from each of the 5 dimensions. Changes in health-related quality of life were 
estimated using a visual analogue scale. 
Safety and tolerability evaluations included electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, clinical chemistry, 
serum lipids, creatinine concentration and urinalysis. Other assessments including height, weight, vital 
signs and concomitant medications were recorded.

Statistical methods 
The power of this study was based on a response rate of 75% at week 48 which was the mid-range of 
response rates observed in EFV arms in recent large clinical studies ranges from 71% to 82%. 
Assuming this response rate in the Atripla arm, the study required 394 evaluable subjects per arm to 
have 90% power with a 10% non-inferiority margin and a one-sided 2.5% significance level. 
The primary analyses were based on the Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population that consisted of 
all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and were assessed 
according to their randomized treatment. Subjects’ responses at Week 48 (e.g. <50 c/mL) were 
calculated according to a Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure algorithm (Snapshot) as codified 
by the FDA’s Snapshot algorithm. Adjusted estimates of the difference in the rate of responders 
between the two arms were based on a stratified analysis using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
weights.  
If non-inferiority was observed in ITT-E and PP primary analysis, with additionally the lower end of the 
95% confidence interval over 0%, superiority of DTG was to be concluded.

Disposition of subjects through week 96. *HSR=hypersensitivity reaction 
Twenty-three percent of screening subjects (246/1090) failed to be enrolled. The reasons for screening 
failure were mainly due to inclusion/exclusion criteria (n=165, 15%), withdrew consent (n=32, 3%) , 
investigator discretion (n=31, 3%), and lost to follow-up (n=19, 2%). 
A total of 844 subjects were randomized, 833 subjects received at least one dose of study drug, and 
652 subjects continued through week 96. More subjects in the Atripla treatment group withdrew from 
the trial prematurely (26% versus 17%, respectively), with the most common reason being due to an 
AE compared to the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group (11% versus 3%, respectively). Adverse events 
are further discussed in the safety section.  
The proportion of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or lost to follow up was similar across both 
treatment arms (4%). Eighteen (4%) subjects in the DTG+ABC/3TC group and 14 (3%) in the Atripla 
arm withdrew due to lack of efficacy (virologic failure).  
A total of 35 subjects had protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the Per Protocol (PP) 
population (DTG + ABC/3TC 18, Atripla 17). Two subjects (DTG+ABC/3TC n=1, Atripla n=1) had 
deviations specific to the Inclusion or Exclusion Criteria. Three subjects were excluded from the PP 
population, because they had interrupted investigational product (IP) for >10% of the total time they 
were on treatment (DTG+ABC/3TC 2, Atripla 1). Ten subjects (DTG+ABC/3TC 6, Atripla 4) 
permanently discontinued IP due to protocol deviations. These withdrawals were due to pregnancy 
(n=5), use of prohibited meds (n=1), non-compliance with IP (n=6), and non-compliance with protocol 
procedure (n=3). 
Twenty-six (3%) subjects (DTG+ABC/3TC 14, Atripla 12) permanently discontinued IP due to protocol 
deviations. These withdrawals were due to pregnancy (n=9), use of prohibited meds (n=3), non-
compliance with IP (n=9), and non-compliance with protocol procedure (n=7).  
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects were white (68%) and male (84%); the median age of the ITT-E population 
was 35 years. In the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group, only one subject was age 65 years or older, 
and in the Atripla treatment group, 6 subjects were age 65 years or older. A total of 53 patients on 
DTG and 44 on Atripla were ≥ 50 years of age.  About 68% of the patients included were white 
Caucasian. Demographic and disease characteristics were comparable between treatment groups.

The mean time of exposure during the double-blind phase to DTG + ABC/3TC (N=414) was 606 days. 
In the Atripla group (N=419), the mean time of exposure was 554 days. The difference between 
treatment arms is driven by the fact that more subjects on Atripla discontinued the study early. 
Outcomes  
The primary analysis at week 48 demonstrated that DTG + ABC/3TC is non-inferior to Atripla, with 
88% of DTG+ABC/3TC subjects and 81% of Atripla subjects achieving the primary endpoint of <50 
c/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA based on outcomes of MSDF (Snapshot) algorithm. This was supported by the 
PP-analysis (90% versus 81% responders in the DTG and Atripla group, respectively).  In addition, 
superiority of DTG + ABC/3TC vs. Atripla was concluded at week 48. 
The week 96 results continue to support the results seen at Week 48. DTG+ABC/3TC demonstrated 
sustained antiviral activity over 96 weeks. This result is supported by the PP analysis (83% and 75% 
responders on DTG + ABC/3TC and Atripla, respectively). Statistical analysis also demonstrated 
superiority of DTG over Atripla.

DTG+ABC/3TC was associated with a rapid virologic response, which was sustained through week 96. 
Median time to viral suppression was 28 days with DTG + ABC/3TC and 84 days with Atripla. 
Sensitivity analyses supporting the primary endpoint were conducted: Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 
proportion of subjects without treatment related failure (TRDF) by Week 96 were numerically greater 
with the DTG + ABC/3TC compared to the Atripla treatment group (93% versus 84%) and supportive 
of the primary results, while the proportion of subjects without efficacy related failure (ERDF) was 
essentially the same on both treatment groups (94% for both groups). 
The time to viral suppression was much shorter with abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir than.

Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
At week 96, DTG showed higher proportions of responders compared to Atripla in patients with low 
baseline viremia (85% versus 73%, respectively), whereas proportion of responders were comparable 
in patients with high baseline viremia (71% and 72%, respectively). This difference between viral load 
strata was not seen at week 48 (Table 15).  
Higher response rates were observed in the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group for baseline CD4+ cell 
counts above 200 c/mL; similar response rates were observed within the <50 c/mL and 50 to <200 
c/mL CD4+ cell count subgroups.

Stratified analysis by baseline viral load showed that in the high viral load subgroup, there were more 
"discontinuations due to other reasons" in the DTG + ABC/3TC group, with 14 (10%) in the DTG group 
vs. 8 (6%) in the EVF/TDF/FTC group (Table 16). Further, there is a slightly higher rate of “virologic 
non-response” for DTG + ABC/3TC than EVF/TDF/FTC (15% versus 12%, respectively), driven by data 
in window not <50 c/mL (6% versus 4%, respectively). The difference between treatment arms in 
withdrawals due to AE is consistent in both the high and low viral load subgroups.

Subgroup analyses by age (<50 and ≥ 50 years), gender and race at week 48 showed that the 
treatment differences between treatment arms were maintained within demographic subgroups. 
Immunological response 
The mean change from baseline to week 96 in CD4+ cells in the DTG +ABC/3TC group was + 325 
cells/mm3, compared with + 281 cells/mm3 in the Atripla arm. These results confirm the improved 
immunological response seen at week 48 (change in CD4 cell count of 267 cells/mm3 versus 208 
cells/mm3 with DTG and Atripla, respectively). 
De novo resistance 
A total of 25/414 (6%) subjects in the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group and 25/419 (6%) subjects in 
the Atripla treatment group met the definition of PDVF (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA values <50 c/mL 
HIV-1 RNA on or after Week 24). The majority of subjects who met PDVF in the study had low-level 
viremia (28/50). At confirmed failure, 20/25 (80%) and 17/25 (68%) of subjects with PDVF on DTG + 
ABC/3TC and Atripla, respectively, had <200 c/mL HIV-1 RNA. Of the 134 subjects on DTG + ABC/3TC 
with >100,000 c/mL HIV-1 RNA at baseline, 21 (16%) had PDVF similar to the 17/131 (13%) subjects

on Atripla. In the group with low baseline viral load, 9/280 (3%) subjects on DTG + ABC/3TC and 
12/288 (4%) subjects on Atripla had PDVF.  
Thirteen subjects in the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment arm had integrase (IN) genotype and phenotype at 
both baseline and at the time of PDVF, while 10 subjects in the Atripla treatment arm had IN genotype 
at and phenotype at both baseline and time of PDVF.  
None of the 23 subjects in neither the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group or the Atripla treatment group 
had treatment emergent integrase inhibitor (INI) resistance mutations. In patients treated with 
dolutegravir, 1 de novo mutation without relevance (E157Q/P) was seen in 1 patient at week 24; apart 
from this no other de novo mutations (integrase or reverse transcriptase (RT)gene) were detected.  
Seventeen subjects in the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group had NNRTI genotypic and phenotypic data 
at both baseline and time of PDVF. There were no treatment emergent NNRTI resistance mutations or 
treatment emergent NNRTI phenotypic changes in any of the subjects with PDVF in the DTG + 
ABC/3TC treatment group. Twelve subjects in the Atripla treatment group had NNRTI genotypic and 
phenotypic data at both baseline and time of PDVF. Six subjects in the Atripla arm had treatment 
emergent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations. De novo 
resistance of relevance for efavirenz (K103N and or G190G/A) was selected in 5 patients at week 96 
which also resulted in phenotypic changes. One patient developed a K101E (EFV) mutation which as an 
individual mutation was not of clinical relevance (NNRTI phenotype 1.9 FC to EFV). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
DTG/ABC/3TC FDC is not currently recommended for treatment of children less than 12 years of age as 
DTG and once daily dosing of ABC and 3TC are currently not approved in these children. 
No studies have been performed with the FDC in the paediatric population. The indication in 
adolescents (12-18 years) is based on the approval of the individual components within that age span, 
which is acceptable. The applicant has submitted a PIP (EMEA-001219-PIP01-11). The PDCO has 
granted a waiver for the paediatric population from birth to less than 24 months and a deferral for the 
submission of DTG/ABC/3TC FDC data for subjects from 2 to 18 years of age.  
Supportive studies 
ING113086 (SPRING-2) is a phase III study including 822 ART-naïve subjects who received at least 
one dose of study medication; 169 received DTG 50 mg + ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg FDC. Week 48 
data were discussed previously, the current submission includes 96 weeks data.  
Subjects were stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA (≤or >100,000 c/mL) and choice of NRTI. Main 
inclusion criteria were HIV-1 infected, ART-naive adults ≥18 years of age with plasma HIV-1 RNA 
≥1000 c/mL at screening and ART-naive (≤10 days of prior therapy with any ART agent). 
Subjects starting ABC as part of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone 
must have been screened to be negative for the HLA-B*5701 allele. 
Main exclusion criteria were women who were pregnant or breastfeeding; any evidence of an active 
Center for Disease and Prevention Control (CDC) Category C disease , except cutaneous Kaposi’s 
sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy or historic or current CD4+ cell levels <200 cells/mm3; 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment as determined by Child-Pugh classification; history of 
malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, 
basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; treatment with an 
HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening, or treatment with radiation therapy, 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 67/114 
 
  
  
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, or any immunomodulator within 28 days of Screening; any 
evidence of primary viral resistance in the Screening result or, if known, any historical resistance test 
result; any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥1.5xULN (with >35% direct bilirubin); 
estimated creatinine clearance <50 mL/min via Cockroft-Gault method; recent history (≤3 months) of 
any upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed, with the exception of anal or rectal bleeding. 
Subjects were randomized (1:1) and treated with either DTG 50 mg once daily or RAL 400 mg twice 
daily. Subjects also received a dual combination NRTI backbone (TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC) chosen by the 
investigator. Subjects received double blinded DTG or RAL plus matching placebo tablets during the 
randomized phase of the study (i.e., through the Week 96 study visit). 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the antiviral activity of DTG 50 mg administered once daily 
compared to RAL 400 mg twice daily over 48 weeks using the Snapshot algorithm. Secondary 
objectives included: antiviral and immunological responses over time (including through Week 96); 
incidence, severity, and changes over time in laboratory and clinical safety parameters; assessment of 
population-based PK and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship; and changes in virologic genotype 
and phenotype.                                                   
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 c/mL using 
the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), or “snapshot” algorithm. Non-inferiority of 
DTG 50 mg will be concluded if the lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
difference in proportions (DTG - RAL) is greater than -10%. 
The primary analysis took place after the last subject completed 48 weeks on therapy, and an 
additional analysis was conducted after the last subject completed Week 96. Data through Week 96 is 
presented herein. The primary analysis population is the ITT-E population.  
Sensitivity analyses were performed using the Treatment Related Discontinuation = Failure (TRDF) 
data and Efficacy Related Discontinuation = Failure (ERDF) data. For TRDF, subjects who have not met 
PDVF criteria and are ongoing in the study, or who have discontinued for reasons other than those 
related to treatment, will be censored. For ERDF, subjects who have not met PDVF criteria and are 
ongoing in the study, or who have discontinued for reasons other than lack of efficacy, will be 
censored.  
Key secondary analyses included the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at week 
96 suppression; proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 c/mL at Weeks 48 and 96; 
change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA over time;  the change from baseline in CD4 and CD8 over 
time, incidence of disease progression ((HIV-associated conditions, AIDS and death). 
For subjects confirmed as virological failures, viral genotyping and phenotyping analyses were 
conducted. Proportion of subjects with detectable virus that has genotypic and/or phenotypic evidence 
of INI resistance at Weeks 48 and 96 was assessed.  
The primary safety population consisted of all subjects who received at least one dose of 
investigational product (i.e., DTG or RAL). Safety assessment included incidence and severity of AEs 
and laboratory abnormalities; absolute values and changes over time in laboratory parameters; 
proportion of subjects who discontinue treatment due to AEs; incidence of any clinically significant 
changes in ECG profiles; change from baseline in vital signs.

Outcomes 
Eight hundred twenty-seven subjects were randomized (DTG: n=413, RAL: n=414), and 822 received 
at least one dose of study drug (n=411 in both arms). At baseline the median age was 36 years, 14% 
were female, 15% non-white, 28% had HIV-1 RNA >100,000 c/mL, and 41% used ABC/3TC as their 
background dual NRTI. Demographic and disease characteristics were comparable between treatment 
arms.

The proportion of subjects achieving the primary endpoint at week 48 (proportion with HIV-1 RNA <50 
c/mL) was 88% for DTG and 85% for RAL; the difference (2.5%; 95% CI: -2.2% to 7.1%) met the 
10% non-inferiority criteria. At week 96, a sustained response was observed in both treatment arms, 
with 81% of DTG subjects and 76% of RAL subjects achieving <50 c/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA and non-
inferiority was reached. The trend for higher virologic success is driven by the subgroup of subjects 
with baseline HIV-1 RNA >100,000 c/mL, the response rate being 78% for DTG vs. 63% for RAL at 
week 96 (Table below). 
Stratified analysis by baseline viral load and NRTI backbone showed that the results were consistent 
across both backbone regimens at week 48: DTG and RAL were relatively similar in efficacy and their 
activity was comparable regardless of NRTI-combination or baseline viral load. Only when TDF/FTC was 
used in combination with RAL in subjects with a high baseline viral load, differences were evident (83% 
vs 71% of DTG vs RAL and 71% vs 82% of RAL+TDF/FTC vs RAL+ABC/3TC). At week 96, comparable 
or slightly better efficacy is also seen for DTG versus RAL, especially in patients with a high baseline 
viral load: 78% vs 63% for DTG vs RAL in the overall population. Overall, the NRTI-combination 
TDF/FTC resulted in higher virologic response at week 96 than ABC/3TC regardless of use of DTG or 
RAL, or viral load at baseline.

a Adjusted difference based on Cochrane-Mantel Haenszel stratified analysis adjusting for the baseline stratification 
factors: Baseline HIV-1 RNA and backbone dual NRTI. 
Subgroup analyses stratified for different demographic or other disease characteristics yielded similar 
proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at week 96. 
ING114915 (FLAMINGO) is a phase IIIb study including 484 ART-naïve subjects who received at 
least one dose of study medication; 79 received DTG 50 mg + ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg FDC.  
Main inclusion criteria were HIV-1 infected adults ≥18 years of age, screening plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) ≥1000 copies/milliliter (c/mL), and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (≤10 days of prior 
therapy with any ART agent). Subjects starting ABC as part of the NRTI background were to be 
screened and be negative for the HLA-B*5701 allele. 
Main exclusion criteria were pregnancy or breastfeeding, any active CDC category C disease, except 
cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy or historic or current CD4+ cell levels 
<200 cells/mm3; moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Class B or C) as determined by Child-Pugh 
classification; anticipated need for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the study; history of 
malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, 
basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; treatment with an 
HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening; or treatment with radiation therapy, 
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, or any immunomodulator within 28 days of Screening; any

evidence of primary viral resistance in the screening result or in history, any verified Grade 4 
laboratory abnormality; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT 
≥3 × ULN and bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN (with >35% direct bilirubin); creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min 
via Cockroft-Gault method; recent history (≤3 months) of any upper or lower GI bleed, with the 
exception of anal or rectal bleeding. 
Appropriate subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once daily or DRV+RTV 800 
mg+100 mg once daily, each in combination with fixed-dose combination NRTI therapy (either 
ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC), for 96 weeks. Subjects were stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA (≤ or >100,000 
c/mL) and choice of NRTI (ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC).  
The primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of dolutegravir (DTG) 50 
mg administered once daily compared to darunavir + ritonavir (DRV+RTV) 800 mg+100 mg once daily 
over 48 weeks in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected therapy naïve subjects.  
Secondary objectives included: antiviral activity over 96 weeks, effects on fasting glucose and lipid 
over time; tolerability and long-term safety; incidence of HIV-associated conditions; antiviral and 
immunologic activity over time, and changes in virologic genotype and phenotype.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 c/mL using 
the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), or “snapshot” algorithm. Non-inferiority will 
be concluded if the lower bound of a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in 
response rates between the 2 treatment arms is greater than -12%. 
The primary analysis took place after the last subject completed 48 weeks on therapy, and an 
additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completed Week 96. Data through week 48 
is presented herein. 
Key secondary endpoints included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
time to viral suppression (<50 c/mL) through week 48; 
proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at week 96;  
proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 c/mL at weeks 48 and 96;  
absolute values and change from Baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell over 
time;  
and incidence of disease progression. 
Safety endpoints included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities 
over time, absolute values and changes over time in laboratory parameters, change from baseline in 
fasting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at weeks 48 and 96, incidence of Grade 2 or greater 
laboratory abnormalities in fasting LDL cholesterol by Weeks 48 and 96, proportion of subjects who 
discontinue treatment due to AEs, change from baseline in vital signs, and incidence of clinically 
significant changes in electrocardiogram profiles. 
The virology endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance to 
DTG, DRV+RTV and other on-study ART. 
Health outcomes endpoints included change from baseline in symptom count and symptom bother 
score for DTG and DRV+RTV at Weeks 4, 24, 48 and 96, change from Baseline in utility and health-
related quality of life for DTG and DRV+RTV at Weeks 24, 48 and 96, and treatment satisfaction for 
DTG and DRV+RTV at Weeks 24, 48 and 96.

The primary population used for study population, efficacy and health outcome summaries, analyses, 
and figures was the mITT-E Population, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 
dose of investigational product (IP) and who were not at a specific study center. The primary 
population used for safety analyses was the mSafety Population, 
defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of IP (i.e., DTG or DRV+RTV) and who were not at 
a specific study center. 
Tolerability and long-term safety over time of DTG compared to DRV+RTV was assessed by the 
incidence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) and graded laboratory toxicities, as well as summaries of 
laboratory tests, vital signs, and incidence of electrocardiogram abnormalities. 
Outcomes 
A total of 488 subjects were randomly assigned to a study treatment (DTG 243, DRV+RTV 245). Of 
these, 484 subjects were included in the Modified Safety (mSafety) Population and 484 subjects were 
included in the Modified Intent-to-Treat Exposed (mITT-E) Population, 242 in each treatment arm. The 
majority of patients were ongoing after week 48 (93% on DTG and 88% on DRV/r). 
A total of 18 subjects (7%) prematurely withdrew from the DTG arm and 29 subjects (12%) from the 
DRV/r arm. Most common reasons were lost to follow-up (6 subjects (2%) and 10 subjects (4%) in the 
DTG and DRV/r treatment arm, respectively) and adverse events (3 subjects (1%) and 9 subjects 
(4%) in the DTG and DRV/r treatment arm, respectively).  
A total of 5 subjects (2%) in the DTG treatment arm and 7 subjects (3%) in the DRV/r treatment arm 
had major protocol violations leading to exclusion from the PP population.  
The majority of subjects were white (72%) and male (85%); the median age of the mITT-E Population 
was 34 years. Three subjects in the DTG treatment group and 1 subject in the DRV+RTV treatment 
group were age 65 years or older. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were distributed 
similarly across treatment groups (Table below).  
At the start of the study, 33% of subjects were prescribed ABC/3TC as background NRTI, with the 
remainder receiving TDF/FTC (67%). Switch of NRTI therapy to an alternative approved NRTI therapy 
for toxicity management was allowed once during the study. At the time of this analysis, 8 subjects 
had permanently switched therapy: 2 subjects (DTG 1, DRV+RTV 1) switched from ABC/3TC to 
TDF/FTC, and 6 subjects (DTG 4, DRV+RTV 2) switched from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC. 
The median time of exposure to both DTG (N = 242) and DRV/r (N = 242) was 337 days. The 
proportion of subjects receiving therapy for more than 48 weeks in the DTG treatment group (186, 
77%) was similar to the DRV+RTV treatment group (181, 75%).

1 patients in the DRV treatment arm had both Hep B and C 
At week 48, 90% of DTG subjects and 83% of DRV+RTV subjects had achieved <50 c/mL plasma HIV-
1 RNA. The primary analysis demonstrated that DTG is non-inferior to DRV+RTV at week 48 
(treatment difference 7%, lower end 95% CI: -0.9%). This result was supported by the PP analysis 
(response rates of 91% and 84% for DTG and DRV+RTV, respectively, lower end 95% CI: 1.4%).  
Subgroup analyses of the primary analysis showed the trend for higher efficacy of DTG was driven by 
the difference in subjects with high baseline viremia, whereas similar results were obtained in subjects 
with low baseline viral load (Table 20). Further, subgroup analyses by backbone and baseline viral load 
showed comparable efficacy between backbone regimens in combination with DTG independent of 
baseline viral load, although numbers with high baseline viremia are low.

Beginning at week 4, the rates of absolute change in HIV-1 RNA had a more rapid rate of decline up to 
week 24 in the DTG treatment group, although both treatment groups had sustained average 
decreases from baseline over time through week 48. The median time to viral suppression was 28 days 
for subjects in the DTG treatment group compared to 85 days in the DRV+RTV treatment group. 
Differences in virologic response rates between DTG and DRV/rtv were primarily driven by 
discontinuations due to AEs (DTG 1%, DRV/rtv 4%) and other reasons (DTG 2%, DRV/rtv 5%) prior to 
week 48 (Table below). The proportion of virologic non-responders by the “snapshot” algorithm 
through week 48 was 6% in the DTG group and 7% in the DRV+RTV group, while 4% of subjects in 
the DTG treatment group and 10% in the DRV+RTV treatment group were considered virologic non-
responders due to lack of virologic data at Week 48.

Subgroup analysis by demographic and baseline characteristics, including race, sex, age, HIV risk 
factors, baseline CDC category, Baseline CD4+ and country, generally supported the primary results. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of subjects without treatment- and efficacy related failure at 
Week 48 were similar for DTG and DRV+RTV and supportive of the primary results.  
Median (IQR) baseline CD4 counts were 390 cells/mm3 (290, 500) and 400 cells/mm3 (300, 530) in 
the DTG and DRV+RTV treatment arm, respectively. The median change from Baseline to Week 48 in 
CD4+ cells was 210 cells/mm3 in both treatment groups.  
ING11762 (SAILING) is a phase III study including 715 ART-experienced, INI-naïve subjects who 
received at least one dose of study medication; 8 received DTG 50 mg + ABC/3TC 600/300 mg FDC. 
This study formed the basis for the ART-experience population within the DTG single entity submission.  
Main inclusion criteria were HIV-1 infected, INI-naïve, ART-experienced adults ≥18 years of age with 
ongoing treatment failure (>400 copies/mL), with documented resistance to at least 2 drug classes 
other than integrase inhibitors.

Main exclusion criteria included: screening resistance test showing no fully active ART available for the 
background regimen, subject-virus did not yield results using genotype/phenotype/tropism at 
screening, pregnancy and breastfeeding, active CDC Category C disease (except cutaneous Kaposi’s 
sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy or historic or current CD4+ cell levels <200 cells/mm3), 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment, Grade 4 laboratory abnormality, recent history (≤3 months) 
of upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed (without anal or rectal bleeding), ALT >5x upper limit of

malignancy within the past 5 years, any agent with documented activity against HIV-1 in vitro (with 
the exception of entecavir) within 28 days the first dose of investigational product (IP). 
Subjects were randomized to DTG 50 mg once daily or RAL 400 mg twice daily (BID), both in 
combination with investigator selected background therapy based on screening and historic resistance 
results. The background therapy was limited to no more than two antiretroviral agents, of which one is 
fully active. Patients were stratified for baseline viral load (≤ 50,000 vs > 50,000 c/ml) and 
darunavir/r use in the background regimen (treated without primary PI mutations versus not treated 
or having primary PI mutations).  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the non-inferior antiviral activity of DTG to RAL through 
week 48 by snapshot algorithm as the primary endpoint.  
The population for the primary analysis was the mITT-E population, excluding patients from one site 
with GCP non-compliance. The non-inferiority margin was set at -12%.  
Secondary objectives included: antiviral and immunological response over time; incidence, severity 
and changes over time in laboratory and clinical safety parameters; assessment of population-based 
PK and PK/PD parameters; and changes in virologic genotype and phenotype. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) <50 c/mL through Week 48 using the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF) 
“snapshot” algorithm. An interim analysis was conducted after the last subject completed Week 24. 
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 24 
using the MSDF algorithm (principal secondary endpoint); proportion of subjects with detectable virus 
that has genotypic or phenotypic evidence of INI resistance by Week 48 (or Week 24); proportion of 
subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 c/mL at Week 24 and Week 48; absolute values and changes 
from baseline in CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts over time; incidence of disease progression (HIV-
associated conditions, AIDS and death); change from baseline in the number of drug classes available 
at Week 48 (or Week 24). Health outcomes were assessed by the European Quality of Life – 5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D) scale that rates subject’s health status on five dimensions of health (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). 
Virology: 
The virology endpoint was the incidence of treatment emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance to 
DTG, RAL and other on-study ART. This was assessed at week 24 and week 48. 
Safety and tolerability evaluations included electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, clinical chemistry, 
serum lipids, creatinine concentration and urinalysis. Other assessments including height, weight, vital 
signs and concomitant medications also were recorded.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Seven hundred and nineteen subjects were randomized (DTG n=357, RAL n=362) into the study and 
received at least one dose of investigational product. The mITT-E population included 715 subjects

(DTG n=354; RAL, n=361). At baseline, the median age was 43 years, 32% were female, and 42% 
were African American/African Heritage. Subjects had an overall median duration of prior ART of 
greater than 6 years, 47% of subjects had been exposed to 3 or more ART classes, 49% had 
resistance to 3 or more ART classes (and possibly other archived resistance), and subjects had one to 
two antiretroviral drugs in their background regimen. Most subjects had received the triple combination 
NRTI+ NNRTI + PI (40%) or the double combination NRTI + NNRTI (39%) before starting the study.

Background regimens received during the treatment phase of the study were diverse, with boosted PIs 
being a component of the most commonly prescribed regimens (a total of 605 subjects received a 
boosted protease inhibitor [DTG: 305/354, 86%; RAL: 300/361, 83%]). DRV/r with tenofovir was the 
most commonly used regimen (18% and 20% in DGT and RAL treatment arms, respectively). 
A total of 59% of patients did not have DRV/r use in the background ART regimen, 21% had DRV/rtv 
without primary PI mutations and 20% DRV/r with primary PI mutations as background ART regimen. 
Only 8 patients received the backbone of interest (ABC/3TC 600/300 mg FDC) in combination with DTG 
(one of them was also taking maraviroc). 
Outcomes 
At week 48, 71% of subjects receiving DTG and 64% of subjects receiving RAL achieved the primary 
endpoint (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL). This difference in response was statistically significant with a 95% 
confidence interval for the adjusted difference of 0.7% to 14.2% (p=0.030). This result is supported 
by the PP analysis where 73% and 66% of DTG and RAL subjects, respectively, achieved plasma HIV-1 
RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 (adjusted treatment difference and 95% CI: 7.5 (0.6, 14.3)). 
A separate analysis of the primary endpoint was performed on the subpopulation excluding subjects 
receiving DRV/r within the background regimen without evidence of primary PI mutations at baseline. 
Based on this population, 71% of subjects receiving DTG and 62% of subjects receiving RAL achieved

plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at week 48 (adjusted treatment difference and 95% CI: 10.2 (3.9, 
16.6)). This finding supports the results of the primary Week 48 analysis. 
Regardless of the activity of the background regimen, use of recently approved ARTs in background 
regimen (with the noted exception for subjects receiving DRV/r without primary PI mutations described 
above), or current vs. historical evidence of resistance to establish study eligibility, the proportion of 
subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL was consistently higher in subjects receiving DTG compared 
to subjects receiving RAL.

There were fewer virologic non-responders using the snapshot (MSDF) algorithm through week 48 in 
the DTG group compared to the RAL group (DTG: 20%; RAL: 28%). This result was driven by data 
within the window for HIV-1 RNA not being <50 c/mL (DTG: 10%; RAL: 13%) and discontinuations for 
lack of efficacy (DTG: 5%; RAL: 10%). At PDVF, there was also a statistically significant difference in 
favor of DTG for the proportion of subjects harboring virus with treatment-emergent evidence of INI 
resistance by Week 48 (DTG: 4/354 [1%]; RAL: 17/361 [5%]; p=0.003). 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of subjects without treatment or efficacy-related failure by 
Week 48 indicated statistically significant differences in favor of DTG, which was supportive of the 
primary analysis results.  
The mean changes in CD4 count were similar between arms; around 100 cells/ mm3 at week 24. Mean 
and median CD4+ cell counts further increased to week 48 in the DTG and RAL groups. The mean 
changes in CD4+ cell count from Baseline were +162.4 cells/mm3 in the DTG group and +153.2 
cells/mm3 in the RAL group at 48 weeks.

ING116070 (CSF study) is a phase IIIb study including 13 ART-naïve subjects who received at last 
one dose of study medication; all 13 received DTG 50 mg + ABC/3TC 600/300 mg FDC. This study is 
not discussed again within the efficacy section given the low number of patients included.   
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The combination of abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir) was superior to Atripla in the fully blinded 
SINGLE study. The response rate at week 48 was 88% versus 81% (+7.4% (95% CI: 2.5%, 12.3%)). 
The difference of 7% remained at week 96. 
Abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir yielded similar results as abacavir/lamivudine in combination with 
raltegravir (SPRING-2 wk 48; 86% versus 87%) and darunavir/r (FLAMINGO wk 48; 90% versus 
85%).  
Also when comparing outcomes with abacavir/lamivudine+dolutegravir versus outcomes yielded with 
tenofovir/emtricitabine-based treatment similar response rates were observed:  in comparison to 
tenofovir/emtricitabine + dolutegravir or raltegravir in SPRING-2 (wk 48; 86% versus 89% and 85%, 
respectively), and tenofovir/emtricitabine + darunavir/r in FLAMINGO (wk 48, 90% versus 81%). 
Of note, similar efficacy results were obtained in patients with a baseline viral >100.000 copies/ml. 
In two previous studies the abacavir/lamivudine components showed a signal for suboptimal efficacy in 
patients with a high baseline viral load (>100,000 copies/ml), which was not observed with 
tenofovir/emtricitabine. The concerned studies did not contain an integrase inhibitor-based regimen.   
The studies relevant for the Triumeq application do not contain a blinded comparison between these 
two pairs of NRTIs in combination with dolutegravir. The only study which was fully blinded (also for 
the NRTI-components) was the SINGLE study, where abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir was 
compared to tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz (as Atripla). Hence, it was not formally studied whether 
abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir provides the same efficacy as tenofovir/emtricitabine + 
dolutegravir in patients with a high baseline viral load. However, the outcomes versus various 
preferred regimens in the studies presented are considered reassuring. In particular as no resistance 
development (to the integrase inhibitor class or to the NRTIs) was observed in patients treated with 
dolutegravir. Therefore the CHMP considered that a cautionary statement with regards to baseline viral 
load is not warranted in the Triumeq SmPC. 
In summary, the combination of abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir showed at least comparable 
efficacy to other preferred regimens (Atripla, 2 NRTIs + darunavir/ritonavir, 2 NRTIs + raltegravir). 
Importantly, with 96 weeks data SINGLE and SPRING-2 and 48 weeks data from FLAMINGO there is 
still not one single patients treated with dolutegravir (including in combination with 
abacavir/lamivudine) where a selection of relevant resistance was seen.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir as a combination has shown convincing efficacy in the dolutegravir 
development program. Similar or better response rates were seen than with recommended reference 
treatments. The high resistance barrier in patients naïve to the integrase inhibitor class is of clinical 
relevance.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The DTG/ABC/3TC FDC contains the active substances DTG, ABC and 3TC at the same once daily doses 
as recommended for the individual components in antiretroviral therapy (ART)- naive and experienced 
adults (i.e., 50 mg, 600 mg and 300 mg, respectively). An assessment of the safety of each individual 
component taken alone as well as the safety of the components when used in combination has been 
provided. 
Apart from bioequivalence (BE) studies, no clinical trials have been conducted with the DTG/ABC/3TC 
FDC. The separate medicinal products have been evaluated in numerous studies.  
As the DTG component is a new chemical entity, full safety data on this single entity used in 
antiretroviral (ARV) combination regimens (with and without the ABC/3TC FDC) to treat INI-naive 
adult subjects has been provided. Clinical experience supporting the FDC has been obtained by 
investigating the DTG single entity and the ABC/3TC FDC in combination, to treat HIV infected Adult 
Subjects in Phase IIb to IIIb randomised clinical trials.  
Key safety data on the ABC/3TC component that support the safety claims in the company reference 
safety information (RSI) and Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for the ABC/3TC FDC tablet 
have been provided with the application. Data from the Phase III studies that were submitted to 
register the once daily dosing applications for both ZIAGEN and EPIVIR are included to fulfil this 
requirement for the ABC and 3TC single entities. These studies are considered to be the most 
contemporary registration studies conducted for the separate preparations, because treatment options 
and recommendations have evolved in the time since ZIAGEN and EPIVIR were first marketed at their 
original twice daily dosing schedules. 
Patient exposure 
The description of safety data is based upon the Summary of Clinical Safety collected and analysed 
through 31 May 2013. 
DTG/ABC/3TC  
Healthy subjects 
In the phase I BA/BE study ING114580 66 subjects received the co-formulated DTG/ABC/3TC FDC 
tablets and the DTG single entity (SE) tablet plus the ABC/3TC FDC tablet. 
DTG+ABC/3TC 
ART-naïve subjects 
In total, 679 HIV-1 infected ART-naïve subjects received DTG 50 mg once daily + ABC/3TC 600/300 
mg once daily in studies ING114467 (SINGLE),  ING113086 (SPRING-2), ING112276 (SPRING-1), 
ING114915 (FLAMINGO). Furthermore, 13 HIV infected ART naïve subjects were exposed to DTG + 
ABC/3TC FDC in ING116070 (Study designed to determine plasma DTG concentration and evaluate the 
relationship between DTG concentration in plasma and Cerebral Spinal Fluid).

In study CNA30021, 384 and 386 subjects were exposed to ABC once daily and ABC BID respectively, 
with a median duration of exposure of 372 and 367 days, respectively. 
In study EPV20001, 272 subjects were exposed to 3TC once daily and 3TC BID respectively with a 
median duration of exposure of 337 days and 336 days respectively. 
ART-experienced 
In study CAL30001, 93 and 89 subjects were exposed to ABC/3TC FDC once daily and ABC BID+3TC 
once daily respectively, with a median duration of exposure of 336 days in both arms. 
In study ESS30008, 130 and 130 subjects were exposed to ABC+3TC BID and ABC/3TC once daily 
respectively, with a median duration of exposure of 336 days in both arms. 
Safety in bioequivalence study in healthy adults 
Study ING114580 was a Phase I bioequivalence study of the combined formulated tablet (50 mg/600 
mg/300 mg DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablet) compared to one DTG 50 mg tablet + one ABC/3TC (600 
mg/300 mg) tablet with and without food in healthy adult subjects. 
Dosing with DTG+ABC/3TC fasted and the FDC fasted demonstrated similar tolerability during Part A. 
The most commonly-reported AEs during Part A were nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and 
somnolence. Tolerability was similar between the two treatments, although the incidence of nausea 
was higher in the separate entities group (29%) compared to the FDC (17%). 
Dosing with FDC and a high fat meal was well-tolerated during Part B of the study. No AEs were 
reported during Part B, in healthy subjects already exposed to the FDC and DTG+ABC/3TC during Part 
A of the study. 
No Grade 3 or 4 AEs, deaths or non-fatal SAEs were reported during the study. One subject was 
withdrawn from Part A of the study due to an AE (vomiting, considered related to FDC administration). 
No consistent, treatment related or clinically significant changes in mean or median hematology or 
clinical chemistry values were observed in the study. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or 
ECGs were observed during the study. 
Adverse events 
Common adverse events (≥5%) 
Diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, nausea, headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported clinical 
AEs occurring at similar rates within studies across the treatment groups (table S2). The AEs observed 
at higher frequency with DTG + ABC/3TC were insomnia, which was primarily observed in ING114467. 
Otherwise, AE rates between DTG +ABC/3TC and RAL +ABC/3TC were generally similar, and AEs such 
as dizziness, rash, nightmare and abnormal dreams occurred at higher frequencies in the 
EFV+ABC/3TC and/or Atripla (EFV/TDF/FTC) treatment groups.

Overall, AEs were most commonly reported from the infections and infestations and from the 
gastrointestinal disorders SOCs, occurring at comparable frequencies across the treatment groups 
within studies.  
DTG +ABC/3TC had fewer AEs in the Nervous system disorders, Psychiatric disorders and Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders SOCs, than observed for EFV+ABC/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC treatment 
groups. AEs for DTG+ABC/3TC in all SOCs were comparable to RAL+ABC/3TC (Table 24), with the 
exception of events from the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC, which were more 
commonly reported for RAL+ABC/3TC

Nausea, diarrhoea, and headache were the most commonly reported drug-related AEs (as assessed by 
the reporting investigator), which in general occurred at similar or less frequently reported rates with 
DTG +ABC/3TC than the comparator treatment groups (Table 25). 
Overall, similar drug-related AEs (type and frequency) were reported for DTG +ABC/3TC and RAL 
+ABC/3TC, but more drug-related AEs were reported for EFV +ABC/3TC, DRV + RTV +ABC/3TC and 
Atripla treatment groups (Table 25). Also, in the Phase III and IIIb studies, a higher proportion of 
subjects reported drug- related AEs in the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group in ING114467 (which 
involved the Atripla comparator group), than were observed for the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment groups in 
ING113086 and ING114915. Insomnia was observed at a higher frequency with DTG +ABC/3TC than 
in comparator arms, which was primarily observed in ING114467. In this study there was a higher rate 
of certain AEs in the EFV/TDF/FTC arm.

considered reasonably attributable to IP by reporting investigators across treatment groups (Table 2), 
including two cases of drug hypersensitivity and one case of hepatitis. In ING114467 a higher 
frequency of drug related events was observed with the Atripla treatment group when compared with 
DTG +ABC/3TC (Table27). Frequencies in all other studies were comparable across treatment groups.

Deaths 
DTG+ABC/3TC FDC 
As of the 31 May 2013 cut-off date, there were a total of three deaths reported from DTG clinical 
studies in ART naïve adult subjects receiving ART regimens relevant to this application. One subject 
receiving DTG+ABC/3TC in supporting study ING112276 and two receiving Atripla in pivotal study 
ING114467 died. One of the three deaths was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to 
study drug TDF/FTC/EFV (renal failure). 
DTG 
Nine deaths were reported from the DTG development programme in INI-naïve subjects up to the 31st 
May 2013 data lock point. 
Six involved ART-naive subjects (ING112276, ING113086, and ING114467). Three had received DTG, 
two received Atripla and one received RAL. Three involved ART-experienced (INI-naive) subjects 
(ING111762). All had received RAL. 
Only one fatal case was associated with a drug related event. In addition to the deaths in studies 
conducted in INI naïve subjects there were four deaths in the single-armed VIKING studies in INI-
resistant subjects. None were considered drug-related.

There were five deaths reported across ABC and 3TC once daily registration studies. All deaths were 
reported in ART-naive subjects in CNA30021; two subjects in the ABC once daily group and three 
subjects in the ABC BID group. None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be related to 
the study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
Liver and renal chemistry has been discussed in the previous section.  
No clinically significant patterns of changes in hematology parameters were identified. No clinically 
significant patterns of changes in electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate), in 
metabolism indices (glucose, calcium and phosphorous)  were identified. 
Lipase elevations have been noted, mostly transient and asymptomatic, and none resulted in a clinical 
diagnosis of pancreatitis. Similar rates were observed across the treatment groups including Grade 3 
and Grade 4 elevations 
Four percent of subjects in the total DTG + ABC/3TC group experienced Grade 3 to 4 events which was 
similar to Atripla and RAL treatment groups and lower than DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC. There were no 
clinically significant effects on the Total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio in any group. 
Creatine Phosphokinase 
Muscle disorders (common) and rhabdomyolysis (rare) are listed events in the ABC/3TC Company RSI. 
In view of the labeling for ABC/3TC and a drug (RAL) in the integrase class, the company characterized 
the risk of myopathy, rhabdomyolosis and Grade 3 to 4 CPK elevations with DTG + ABC/3TC. 
The overall frequency of increased CPK was low and similar between treatment groups in individual 
studies with the exception of ING114915 where a higher frequency of CPK elevations occurred in the 
DTG+ABC/3TC group (15/79, 19%) compared to DRV+ABC/3TC group (11/80, 14%). In Studies 
ING113086 and ING114467 the rates were similar in the treatment groups. The overall rate of Grade 3 
to 4 CPK elevations of 5% in the DTG + ABC/3TC ARTnaïve population was comparable to that seen 
with RAL, Atripla or DRV+ABC/3TC, although there were differences in the individual studies. Most CPK 
elevations were asymptomatic, all resolved spontaneously and no events resulted in discontinuation 
from study drug. 
The incidence of events in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC was similar across 
all groups in the ART-naïve population. The frequency of the individual events was low; the most 
frequently reported events in the total DTG+ABC/3TC group were back pain 6%, arthralgia and pain in 
extremities 4% each. Only 2% of subjects reported muscles spasm or myalgia and 1% musculoskeletal 
pain in the total DTG+ABC/3TC group. All other events were reported in <1% of subjects. 
No withdrawals or treatment interruptions due to musculoskeletal events were observed in the DTG + 
ABC/3TC groups. 
Adverse events of special interest 
AESI have been determined for DTG based on pre-clinical and/or clinical safety data for DTG, labeling 
and/or regulatory authority interest for approved integrase inhibitors and/or the INI class, and/or 
regulatory authority requirements.  
For the ABC/3TC FDC, AESI are based on the identified and potential ongoing risks recognized in the 
2012 EU Risk Management Plan  for the ABC and 3TC actives formulated as the once daily ABC/3TC 
Assessment report

FDC tablet. These risks arose during the original non-clinical and clinical development program for ABC 
(i.e., carcinogenicity and hypersensitivity, respectively) or through post marketing surveillance 
activities (e.g., rash and ischemic cardiac disorders for ABC) and are discussed in this section.  
Based on this information, several AESIs for the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC were identified. The following 
AESIs will be discussed in more detail:

Hypersensitivity Reaction 
The most important risk associated with ABC is a well characterized, idiosyncratic, drug-related HSR 
[Hetherington, 2001; Hughes, 2008; Mallal, 2008], that usually presents with multiple symptoms and 
involves several organ systems, as clearly described in the local product labelling for each of the 
marketed ABC- containing products. HLA-B*5701 has been shown to be highly associated with ABC 
HSR, and the practice of pre-therapy screening for HLA-B*5701 and excluding from abacavir therapy 
those individuals found to carry the allele, reduces the risk of HSR. 
The risk of fatal or life threatening HSR is managed by ensuring that clinicians and patients are aware 
that, even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue ABC and 
not re-challenge with any ABC-containing product if a HSR cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds. 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with integrase inhibitors, including DTG, and were 
characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including liver injury. 
HSR is listed as an ADR for DTG, which also contains a Warning and Precaution for this reaction. 
Given that hypersensitivity is a recognized risk for both the ABC and DTG constituents, further 
characterization of this risk when using these active moieties in combination is warranted. 
The company reviewed AE preferred terms that were considered indicative of hypersensitivity 
reactions; these included AE PTs of hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction 
only and no derivatives. Cases of clinically suspected ABC HSR (as assessed by either the reporting 
investigator or the Sponsor) reported for the pivotal and supporting DTG studies were identified from 
the applicant global safety database. All subjects in the DTG clinical program who used ABC in their 
regimen were required by protocol to have screened negative for HLA-B*5701.

a. ING114467 was the only study in which the dual nucleoside backbone was double-blinded, and provides 
reassurance for a projected low rate of HSR with both DTG and ABC. 
b. Includes AE PTs hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction only and no derivatives 
c. Three non- serious cases for the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group are included in the ING114467 Week 96 CSR; 
however, on review, the non-serious report of drug hypersensitivity for Subject 6393 was upgraded to an SAE by 
the Sponsor, because it was considered to meet the MAH definition for clinically suspected ABC HSR. 
d. FDC ISO data cites one SAE of drug hypersensitivity for the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group in ING114467 and 
four cases of HSR for the total DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group. However, as for footnote c above, one non-serious 
report of drug hypersensitivity for DTG+ABC/3TC Subject 6393 in ING114467 was upgraded to an SAE by the 
Sponsor. See ING114467 Week 96 CSR. 
e. Prior to unblinding at 48 weeks, five cases of clinically suspected ABC HSR were reported from the Atripla 
treatment group in ING114467. 
Ten subjects receiving DTG+ABC/3TC were reported with terms indicative of HSR (hypersensitivity, 
drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction). Reporting rates were similar across studies and 
treatment groups (Table 28).  
No HSR events were reported from ING116070 (CSF study) at the time of the Week 16 analysis. 
With the exception of the Atripla arm in ING114467, in which 5/6 of the HSR events were considered 
of Grade 3 to 4 intensity, the majority of cases from each treatment group were considered of Grade 1 
to 2 intensity. In the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group two HSR events were considered of grade 3 to 4 
intensity. No HSR event resulted in a fatal outcome. In the total DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group, HSR 
resulted in the permanent discontinuation of IP and subject withdrawal in 3 cases.  
Reporting rates were consistent between DTG+ABC/3TC and comparator in ING114467 and 
ING114915 at <1% in each treatment group. ING114467 was the only study in which the dual 
nucleoside backbone was double-blinded, and provides reassurance for a projected low rate of HSR 
with both DTG and ABC. 
There was an imbalance of reports for DTG+ABC/3TC in ING113086 compared to RAL+ABC/3TC, and 
more were reported as SAEs in the DTG+ABC/3TC group. In this study, for 2/3 cases symptoms 
resolved after switching ABC/3TC to TDF/FTC with continued DTG .  
The third case involving DTG+ABC/3TC was reported as reasonably attributable to DTG by the 
reporting investigator. The subject developed flu like symptoms (fever and body aches), approximately 
ten days after commencing study treatment, which progressed over the course of four days to include 
symptoms of rash (profuse, purpuric and coalescing leukocytoclastic vasculitis), arthralgia, palpable 
liver, jaundice and atrial fibrillation. The subject’s ALT peaked at >20 x ULN and his bilirubin at >4 x 
ULN. Clinical improvement was seen after discontinuation of DTG and ABC/3TC and start of

corticosteroid therapy. Non-drug causes of his hypersensitivity reaction were extensively investigated, 
but an alternative cause could not be identified including repeat HLA-B*5701 testing (negative), 
hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), syphilis and autoimmune 
disease. Due to the severity of the reaction, this subject was withdrawn from the study and not 
rechallenged with ABC/3TC or DTG. A reaction to abacavir (associated with HSR reactions) cannot be 
ruled out, but seems not likely since both HLAB5701 and an abacavir skin patch test was negative. A 
reaction on dolutegravir cannot be ruled out. 
The frequency of cases meeting the applicant definition for suspected ABC HSR in ART-naive, HLA-
B*5701 negative subjects from the phase IIb to IIIb clinical trials was <1% for the total 
DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group and also the RAL+ABC/3TC and DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC treatment 
groups. This was comparable to or lower than the incidence for ABC HSR reported in HLA-B*5701 
negative subjects participating in large randomized MAH sponsored clinical trials investigating the 
marketed ABC containing products. Although these data are limited, they suggest that there is no 
additional risk from HSR in HLA-B*5701 negative subjects receiving the DTG/ABC/3TC single tablet 
FDC. 
Rash with or without Systemic Involvement 
Skin rash is associated with many antiretrovirals [NIH, 2012]. Severe skin reactions have been 
reported for ABC associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Rash has also been commonly reported 
without systemic systems (i.e., outside of the context of HSR) in post marketing follow up. Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and Erythema Multiforme (EM) have been 
reported very rarely in patients taking ABC containing products post marketing. 
Given that severe skin reactions are recognized risks for the ABC constituent, and rash is a recognized 
adverse drug reaction for all three components of the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC, characterization of this risk 
when using these active moieties in combination is addressed. 
Any preferred terms related to a rash due to drug were identified from the integrated and pooled data 
from the pivotal and supporting clinical trials in ART- naive adult subjects. This included preferred 
terms such as rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash papular, rash macula-papular, rash pruritic, 
and drug eruption. 
Overall, mild to moderate episodes of rash were commonly reported for DTG+ABC/3TC. The rate and 
nature of rash with DTG+ABC/3TC FDC was no different to that observed for comparators in the Phase 
III/IIIb development program (with the exception of a significantly higher reporting rate observed for 
Atripla), or observed historically for the individual actives DTG, ABC and 3TC. Other than the case 
discussed above with a HSR reaction, no other instances of serious skin reaction, including SJS, TEN, 
or EM were reported across the studies. The majority of the reported episodes were of Grade 1 to 2 
intensity. Grade 3 episodes were reported in only one subject each in the DTG+ABC/3TC and Atripla 
treatment groups from ING114467 and in the RAL+ABC/3TC treatment group form ING113086. No 
Grade 4 episodes of rash were reported across the studies. Additionally, no episodes were reported as 
SAEs, and none resulted in fatal outcome, across the studies.  
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Liver toxicity is a potential safety concern for DTG based on high dose repeat toxicity in cynomolgus 
monkeys, where dose related liver reactions were noted. Studies with DTG showed hepatocellular 
single cell necrosis and diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy and/or vacuolation occurred in male 
monkeys.  DTG is primarily hepatically metabolized via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A component. DTG 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 89/114 
 
  
  
is a substrate for and an inhibitor of UGT1A1. It is likely that competition with bilirubin for a common 
enzymatic clearance pathway could result in an increase in unconjugated (and thus total) bilirubin 
during treatment with DTG. 
There was one severe case of hypersensitivity with a severe liver reaction, fulfilling Hy’s law criteria, 
which is discussed elsewhere. As such, hypersensitivity, including hepatic toxicity was the main safety 
concern during the DTG evaluation. 
There is a Warning in the Product Information for DTG that hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, 
including liver injury. There is also a warning that patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at 
increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of DTG. 
ABC was associated with liver findings in nonclinical studies. All findings were reversible or showed 
evidence of regression except hepatocellular hypertrophy in male mice at 1000 mg (succinate)/kg/day 
for three months.  ABC may be a weak enzyme inducer, and therefore hepatic changes may be 
associated with ABC-induced alterations in metabolic activity. 
Synergistic or additive toxicity is not expected from the co-administration of DTG with ABC and 3TC. 
While both ABC and DTG caused treatment related hepatic effects, the findings in ABC treated animals 
were believed to be adaptive changes related to metabolic enzyme induction, and with DTG the 
findings were observed only at doses that exceeded the maximum tolerated dose. 
Liver was not considered a target organ in nonclinical toxicity studies of 3TC.  
Liver related AEs and liver chemistry in phase 3 - randomized studies 
There were few AEs reported from the hepatobiliary SOC and the incidence was comparable between 
groups. The incidence of Grade 3/4 toxicities in Liver Chemistries was 4% or less in all arms of all 
Phase III studies and 2% for the total DTG treatment group

The occurrence of low grade elevations in total bilirubin amongst DTG +ABC/3TC recipients is likely 
related to competition for common enzymatic pathways (e.g., UGT1A1) for DTG and unconjugated 
bilirubin. Increases were not progressive, nor were they generally associated with increases in other 
liver enzymes (e.g., ALT). The percentage of subjects with ALT>3xULN was similar for DTG + ABC/3TC 
vs. RAL +ABC/3TC (ING113086) and lower for DTG +ABC/3TC compared with Atripla (ING114467). In 
ING114915 the percentage was greater for DTG +ABC/3TC compared with DRV+RTV + ABC/3TC but 
the numbers were small. There were no subjects with ALT>3xULN in either group in ING11276.

Liver chemistry toxicity by hepatitis co-infection status 
Patients with HBV were excluded from the pivotal SINGLE study so there is limited data on use in this 
population (two subjects on DTG+ABC/3TC, two subjects on RAL and one subject on Atripla) and no 
analysis is possible. 
In the ART-naïve subjects with HCV infection at Baseline had a higher incidence of post-baseline 
emergent Grade 2-4 liver chemistry toxicities compared with subjects who were not co-infected  in 
groups treated with DTG, Atripla and RAL. Only six subjects co-infected with HCV were randomized to 
treatment with DRV+RTV and none of them had Grade 2-4 liver chemistry toxicities. For ALT and AST

the incidence of toxicities in subjects with hepatitis virus infection treated with DTG was lower than 
both the RAL and Atripla treated subjects, but similar to subjects treated with DRV + RTV. 
The incidence of liver chemistry toxicities for subjects without hepatitis virus infection was similar in 
DTG, RAL and Atripla groups but lower in the DRV + RTV treated group. However, the percentage of 
subjects with the more severe Grade 3 to 4 elevations of ALT was low and comparable in all groups. 
Grade 2 to 4 elevations in bilirubin were low in all groups in both co-infected and non-infected 
subjects.

Renal Function 
Mild non-progressive changes in serum creatinine were seen for DTG in the Phase IIb studies, and 
therefore of particular interest in phase 3.  Dolutegravir blocks the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT-
2) and the applicant states this to be the reason of this finding. Kidneys were not considered a target 
organ for toxicity in animal studies.  
There were no adverse treatment related renal effects of chronic administration of ABC or 3TC in 
nonclinical toxicity studies. In the label for ABC/3TC it is noted that laboratory abnormalities associated 
with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some subjects include elevated creatinine. 
Renal function parameters of special interest were defined as Creatinine, calculated GFR, BUN, urine 
albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated CrCl. General summary outputs and statistics were created for 
these parameters, in addition to: 
•  Creatinine data was plotted to show the mean +/- standard deviation (SD) over time. 
•  Urinalysis test results were summarized at each assessed time point. A summary of changes in 
proteinuria from Baseline to maximum post-Baseline result was produced. 
•  A summary of Albumin/Creatinine ratio relative to ULN for subjects with Baseline values <= ULN 
was produced. 
Adverse events 
For DTG +ABC/3TC there were 3/679 subjects who reported reports of renal failure or renal 
impairment in total, one subject in ING114467 and two subjects in ING114915. 
Creatinine and Creatinine Clearance 
In ART-naïve subjects, small increases in mean and median creatinine were observed on the DTG + 
ABC/3TC arms. These were evident from Week 1 but plateaued with no evidence of subsequent 
increase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 93/114 
 
  
  
 
 
 
There were 17 (3%) Grade 1 and 5 (<1%) Grade 2 post-Baseline emergent creatinine results, with no 
Grades 3 or 4 in subjects treated with DTG + ABC/3TC. In all of the subjects with Grade 2 levels the 
elevation occurred on a single occasion, but was not confirmed on repeat analyses. None of these 
subjects had associated increases in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. 
Urine Albumin/Creatinine ratio and Dipstick Protein Assessments 
The normal range for albumin/creatinine ratios is <3.4 mg/mmoL. Albumin/creatinine ratios of 3.4 to 
34 mg/mmoL are designated microalbuminuria and ratios >34 mg/mmoL macroalbuminuria. 
Macroalbuminuria is an indication for further investigation and consideration of referral to a 
nephrologist for possible institution of treatment. 
Albuminuria was initially assessed by dipstick testing. However, the dipstick results appeared 
unreliable, particularly in the EFV controlled studies and the more accurate measurement of 
albumin/creatinine ratio confirmed there was no difference in the effect of DTG + ABC/3TC on albumin 
excretion compared with EFV or RAL. 
The change from Baseline in urine albumin/creatinine ratio could only be assessed in the Phase III 
studies, as this measurement was added to the Phase IIb studies by protocol amendments (no values 
were available for the Baseline). Overall, there were marginal changes in the median urine 
albumin/creatinine ratio in the DTG + ABC/3TC and comparator groups. Mean changes in comparator 
arms were occasionally skewed by large outliers, but there was no increase in the DTG + ABC/3TC 
treated groups. The increases were small; for the pooled DTG + ABC/3TC ART-naïve treatment group, 
75% were less than 0.2 mg/mmol. Of those assessed with urine albumin creatinine ratios within the 
normal range at Baseline, only 3-5% of DTG + ABC/3TC and comparator treated subjects had 
increased to >ULN at any Week from Week 24-Week 96 in studies ING113086 and ING114467. In 
study ING114915 the corresponding figure was 8% of subjects in both arms (DTG + ABC/3TC and 
DRV+RTV) but this was a small sample and only represented four subjects in each arm. 
Ischemic Cardiac Disorders 
Some observational studies have suggested an association between myocardial infarction (MI) and the 
use of ABC. However cumulative data from observational cohorts and controlled clinical trials on the 
risk of MI with ABC show some inconsistency and can neither confirm nor refute a causal relationship. 
To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. As a 
precaution, the Company RSI and Local Country Prescribing Information for each of the ABCcontaining 
products recommends that Health Care Professionals should consider the underlying risk of coronary 
heart disease when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including ABC, and action taken to minimize all 
modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking). 
The company reviewed AEs relating to ischemic cardiac disorders. Any preferred terms related to 
ischemic cardiac disorders were identified from the integrated and pooled data from the pivotal and 
supporting clinical trials in ART- naïve Adult Subjects, and were included in the AESI summary tables. 
This included preferred terms myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and coronary artery disease. There 
is little evidence from the non-clinical and clinical trial program for an effect of DTG + ABC/3TC on 
cardiovascular disease. No subjects receiving DTG+ABC/3TC were reported with MI or any other 
ischemic cardiac events, after 1067 subject years of follow up in the pooled DTG+ABC/3TC treatment 
group. The frequency of events reported from the cardiac disorders SOC over all was generally low and 
comparable across studies and treatment groups. There was slight imbalance for DTG+ABC/3TC 
compared to DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC in ING114915 (2/79 [3%] and 0/80 subject reporting events from 
the cardiac disorders SOC). These were nonischemic in nature (tachycardia and cardiac failure).

Gastrointestinal disorders 
The primary nonclinical finding for DTG from repeat dose toxicity studies up to 38 weeks in monkeys 
and 26 weeks in rats was GI intolerance. 
From aggregate analyses of the Phase IIb and Phase III clinical trial data performed as part of the 
initial marketing applications for DTG, mild to moderate events indicative of general GI intolerance 
(mainly diarrhoea and nausea) are associated with DTG treatment in a small proportion of subjects, 
and are listed as adverse reactions in the company reference safety information for DTG. However, 
nonclinical findings for GI erosions did not translate into significant clinical findings.  
As listed in the approved product labeling, the most commonly reported AEs for ABC and/or 3TC have 
been gastrointestinal in nature (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea listed as common 
ADRs). 
Data was medically reviewed for AE Preferred Terms that were considered indicative of general GI 
Intolerance, GI ulceration lesion or pancreatitis. 
From the analysis of available data from the DTG development program, the risk of general GI 
intolerance with DTG/ABC/3TC is not expected to be greater than the risk associated with the single 
entities when used in CART with other ARV agents.  
Overall frequency of GI events was similar between treatment groups in ING1144667 (compared to 
EFV) and ING113086 (compared to RAL+ABC/3TC) but higher in DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC compare to 
DTG+ABC/3TC in the ING114915 study. 
Reporting rates for diarrhoea differed by study. Rates for DTG+ABC/3TC were either comparable to 
Atripla and RAL+ABC/3TC or lower than DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC. Nausea and vomiting were also 
commonly reported, and rates were comparable across ING114467, ING113086 and the total 
DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group. In ING114915 more subjects in the DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC group 
reported nausea and vomiting than for the DTG+ABC/3TC group in this study, and rates for the latter 
treatment group were comparable with DTG+ABC/3TC group overall (679 pooled subjects) and across 
the other studies. The majority of events indicative of general GI intolerance were of Grade 1 to Grade 
2 intensity, and only few drug-related events of Grade 3 to Grade 4 were reported in the ING114467 
with same frequency in both treatment groups. No events of general GI intolerance were reported as 
SAEs. Few GI events resulted in the permanent discontinuation of IP and subject withdrawal, with 
<1% (2/679, n=1 diarrhea; n=1 gastro esophageal reflux, both Grade 3) in the total DTG+ABC/3TC 
treatment group. 
Few subjects were reported with events suggestive of GI ulcerative lesion across the studies and 
treatment groups. Dyspepsia and gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) were most commonly 
reported at similar rates across studies and treatment groups, with an exception of higher frequency of 
GERD in the DTG+ABC/3TC group and dyspepsia in the DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC group in the ING114467 
and the ING114915 respectively. 
In ING114467, a higher number of subjects in the DTG+ABC/3TC FDC treatment group developed 
GERD compared to Atripla. The majority of these GERD episodes were Grade 1 to 2 in intensity. No 
serious cases were reported and no subjects were permanently discontinued from IP and WD from 
study due to GERD.  
Terms indicating potentially more severe GI complications (such as hematochezia/diarrhoea 
hemorrhagic/anal hemorrhage, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, Crohn's disease, erosive duodenitis and 
erosive esophagitis) were rarely reported with no real patterns between treatment groups.

Two events of pancreatitis were reported in one subject in the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group in 
ING114915.  Neither event was considered drug related by the investigator who attributed both events 
to alcoholism. 
Psychiatric Disorders Including Suicidality 
From analysis of integrated Phase IIb and III clinical trial data performed for the initial marketing 
applications for the DTG SE, the psychiatric profile for DTG (incl. suicidality, depression, bipolar and 
hypomania, anxiety and abnormal dreams) was favourable compared with EFV and similar to RAL. 
The reporting rate for insomnia was statistically higher for blinded DTG+ABC/3TC compared to EFV in 
ING114467, this was not duplicated by any other Phase IIb/III study conducted with DTG. 
The appliacant further evaluated psychiatric events, including insomnia, with DTG+ABC/3TC. 
Psychiatric terms were identified from the integrated and pooled data from the pivotal and supporting 
clinical trials in ART- naive Adult Subjects, and were included in the SAS AESI summary tables in the 
FDC ISO. 
Insomnia 
Subjects in the DTG + ABC/3TC treatment group in ING114467 were significantly more likely to 
develop insomnia (i.e., RR values and 95% CI were >1) (p=0.021). This was not seen in any of the 
other Phase IIb to IIIb studies conducted with DTG. 
There are several possibilities to explain the higher rate of insomnia in ING114467.  
Primarily, this is possibly an artifact of the double blinded comparison with the EFVcontaining STR, 
Atripla, which has an ADR profile significant for psychiatric disorders. This has been seen in other 
double blinded clinical trials including an EFV treatment arm.  
Secondly, ING114467 was the first study, and the only double blinded study, in the DTG development 
program that employed the ACTG SDM, which questioned subjects about specific potentially 
bothersome symptoms, at Day 1, Week 4, Week 24, Week 48 and Week 96. It is possible that this 
SDM influenced subjects reporting insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep, which could include 
abnormal dreams) to their Investigator/designee as AEs during routine study visits, particularly given 
the known AE profile for EFV. Additionally, the higher reporting rates for diarrhoea and fatigue for 
ING114467 in comparison to ING113086 (both the total safety population are possibly attributable to 
the use of this tool). 
Suicidal ideation and behaviours 
The reporting rates for AE PTs containing depression, bipolar, suicide and hypomania were low and 
generally comparable across studies and treatment groups. Events were generally mild to moderate 
intensity with few Grade 3 or 4 events and/or SAEs reported; none were fatal (i.e., there were no 
events of completed suicide). 
In ING114915, more episodes were reported in the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group than in the 
DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC treatment group (5/79 [6%] and 2/80 [3%], respectively). Rates were slightly 
higher for study ING114467, and reporting rates were higher for Atripla than for DTG+ABC/3TC 
(40/414 [10%] and 35/419 [8%], respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 96/114 
 
  
  
Anxiety 
Reporting rates for anxiety were low and comparable between treatment groups and across the Phase 
III to IIIb clinical trials, ranging from 3% to 7% for the DTG+ABC/3TC treatment groups and 4% to 
7% for the comparator treatment groups. The majority of subjects developed single episodes, with few 
subjects from either treatment group in ING114467 and from the RAL+ABC/3TC treatment group in 
ING113086 reporting multiple episodes. Drug related episodes were reported only for ING114467, and 
were numerically higher for Atripla (11/419 [3%]) compared to DTG+ABC/3TC (4/414 [1%]). 
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of ART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise and cause serious 
clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  A higher rate of IRIS is a potential concern with DTG 
due to the rapid viral load decline and CD4 cell count recovery associated with DTG based regimen. 
There were few subjects with an NRTI backbone of ABC/3TC who were adjudicated as having definite 
or possible IRIS events. The numbers were too small to discern a pattern and the numbers were 
similar between the DTG + ABC/3TC groups and comparators. 
Neoplasms, Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified (including Cysts and Polyps) 
HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of developing cancer – both AIDS-defining malignancies 
(ADM) and non-AIDS defining malignancies (NADM). In a large U.S.-based study, 10% of HIV-infected 
individuals developed cancer [Crum-Cianflone, 2009]. 
Neither ABC nor 3TC were mutagenic in bacterial tests, but consistent with other nucleoside analogues, 
both inhibit cellular DNA replication in in-vitro mammalian tests such as the mouse lymphoma assay. 
The results of an in-vivo rat micronucleus test with abacavir and 3TC in combination were negative. 
Lamivudine (3TC) has not shown any genotoxic activity in the in-vivo studies at doses that gave 
plasma concentrations up to 40-50 times higher than clinical plasma concentrations. Abacavir has a 
weak potential to cause chromosomal damage both in-vitro and in-vivo at high tested concentrations. 
Carcinogenicity studies with orally administered ABC in mice and rats showed an increase in the 
incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumours. The systemic exposure at the no effect level in 
mice and rats was equivalent to 3 and 7 times the human systemic exposure during therapy. The 
clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  
There were no reports of malignancies considered by Investigators to be related to ABC from the adult 
and paediatric clinical trial program; however it is recognized that these studies characterized the 
short-term safety profile, and were limited in terms of information on long-term safety. 
Non-clinical studies indicated that DTG was not carcinogenic to mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day or 
rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day following oral administration for 104 consecutive weeks. In both 
species, DTG administration had no effect on survival, there were no treatment related clinical signs, 
and there were no neoplastic or non-neoplastic findings attributed to DTG. The NOAEL for non-
neoplastic findings after chronic oral administration was the high dose of 500 mg/kg/day for mice and 
50 mg/kg/day for rats.  
When compared to the anticipated human exposure for a 50 mg once daily or 50 mg BID dose, the 
systemic exposures were ~20X or ~14X and ~17X or ~12X higher for mice and rats, respectively. On 
analysis of pooled Phase IIb and III clinical trial data from the DTG development program conducted 
Assessment report

for the initial marketing applications for the DTG SE, there was no evidence for increased risk of 
neoplasms with DTG. 
The applicant reviewed data for AE PTs that were considered indicative of benign vs malignant 
neoplasms. 
The majority of the AEs reported from the neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including 
cysts and polyps) SOC were non-malignant and the rate was comparable between the treatment 
groups. The most frequently reported AEs in this SOC were anogenital warts and benign skin 
papillomas, occurring at similar rates across the treatment groups. All other events were reported at a 
rate of <1% in the total DTG+ABC/3TC group. 
Few subjects developed malignant or potentially malignant events. All were isolated and occurred in 
only one subject, except basal cell carcinoma in the DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC group and squamous cell 
carcinoma in the DTG+ABC/3TC group, which occurred in two subjects.

Non-clinical evaluation did not reveal an increased risk for cardiac conduction abnormalities with DTG. 
A clinical pharmacology study has been conducted to investigate the effect of DTG on cardiac 
repolarization (ING111856). A single supra-therapeutic dose of DTG (250 mg) had no significant effect 
on cardiac repolarization in a population of 42 healthy subjects (approximately 60% female), when 
compared to moxifloxacin (400 mg; active control) or placebo. In this study with demonstrated ability 
to detect small effects, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the largest 
placebo adjusted, QTcF was below 10 msec, the threshold for regulatory concern. The maximum

observed timematched change from Baseline in QTcF for DTG 250 mg was at 4h (mean ΔΔQTcF of 
1.99 msec, 90% CI: -0.55, 4.53 msec). The maximum observed time-matched change from Baseline 
in QTcF for moxifloxacin was at 4h (mean ΔΔQTcF 9.58 msec, 90% CI: 7.05, 12.11 msec). Since the 
study had adequate sensitivity to detect a positive QT effect with moxifloxacin, it is concluded that this 
study was valid to assess the effects of DTG on cardiac repolarization. The dose of 250 mg using a 
suspension formulation yielded a maximum DTG plasma concentration of 12.4 µg/mL (range: 5.33-
20.5 µg/mL), which was ~2.4 fold above mean Cmax associated with the 50 mg once daily and 50 mg 
BID doses.) 
All subjects in DTG treatment group with QTcF or QTcB >500msec were asymptomatic. Several 
subjects had clinically significant abnormalities but no trends were observed in these abnormalities. No 
difference in frequencies of clinically significant abnormalities were observed between arms in 
individual studies. 
No cases of TdP or sustained ventricular tachycardia have been reported in the ARTNaïve or ART-
experienced (INI Naïve) adult clinical trials. Few AEs potentially related to TdP were reported. (i.e., 
MedDRA AE preferred terms indicative of clinical events including, but not limited to: TdP; sudden 
death; ventricular tachycardia; ventricular fibrillation and flutter; syncope; seizures). 
All AEs were reported at a rate of <1% or in single subjects (ING114915), except syncope (1%) in the 
Atripla arm in ING114467. Four convulsion-related events were reported in total, one grand mal 
convulsion and one epilepsy on DTG (confounded by alcohol consumption and lack of sleep, and head 
injury), one convulsion on Atripla (subject had recently stopped anticonvulsant treatment) and one 
status epilepticus on RAL. No cases of arrhythmia were reported across the treatment groups.  
One case of a non-serious cardiac failure was reported with DTG + ABC/3TC in study ING114915 and 
was considered related to IP.  
Safety in special populations 
As agreed in the DTG/ABC/3TC Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) with the Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO) (EMEA-001219), there is no plan to conduct a  paediatric clinical study of the DTG/ABC/3TC 
(50 mg/600 mg/300 mg) FDC in adolescents. This tablet formulation is intended for adults and 
adolescent populations (i.e., ≥12 to <18 years) who weigh at least 40 kg. 
The proposed adolescent indication for DTG/ABC/3TC is supported by ING112578 (P1093), cohort I (12 
to <18 years), which provides clinical data regarding DTG pharmacokinetics and long term safety and 
efficacy (24 week). No subjects received ABC and 3TC alongside DTG.  
ABC and 3TC are approved for twice daily (BID) use in children aged 3 months to 18 years dosed 
individually and from 12 to 18 years when given once daily as the ABC/3TC FDC. The indication 
includes ART naïve and ART experienced populations. Hence the safety profile of these components in 
this age group has been established and monitored for several years.  
Finally, the adult Phase III data in subjects receiving DTG+ABC/3TC provides long term safety and 
efficacy which can be extrapolated to support adolescents who have similar absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and elimination of the individual entities. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No clinical reprotoxicity studies have been conducted with DTG+ABC/3TC.

Based on animal data, DTG is not anticipated to increase the risk of adverse developmental (or 
reproductive) outcomes in humans when used in accordance with dosing information in the product 
label. Findings for 3TC in the rabbit suggest a potential risk of early embryonic loss. Moreover, there is 
some evidence of mitochondrial toxicity following exposure to lamivudine in utero in different non-
clinical studies. Evidence of early embryo lethality was seen in the rabbit at exposure levels similar to 
those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at exposure levels up to 
32 times those in humans (based on Cmax). Studies in humans have confirmed that 3TC crosses the 
placenta. Abacavir demonstrated toxicity to the developing embryo and foetus in rats at maternally 
toxic doses of 500 mg/kg/day and above. This dose is equivalent to 33 times human therapeutic 
exposure based on AUC. The findings included foetal oedema, variations and malformations, 
resorptions, decreased foetal body weight and an increase in still births. The dose at which there were 
no effects on pre or post-natal development was 160 mg/kg/day. This dose is equivalent to an 
exposure of about 9 times that in humans. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits. 
Twenty-one pregnancies were reported across the pivotal and supporting study populations for the 
DTG/ABC/3TC FDC. Few cases resulted in an adverse pregnancy outcome (e.g., spontaneous abortion 
or ectopic pregnancy), and were comparable for DTG+ABC/3TC, RAL+ABC/3TC and Atripla, and no 
congenital anomalies were reported.

ING113086; and DRV+RTV+ABC/3TC in ING114915 
As DTG, ABC and 3TC have been shown to cross the placenta in reproductive toxicity studies in 
animals and 3TC and ABC have been associated with findings in animal reproductive studies, 
administration of DTG/ABC/3TC in pregnancy should be considered only if the benefit to the mother 
outweighs the possible risk to the fetus. 
3TC and ABC are excreted in human milk and have some detectable exposure levels in breastfed 
infants. However, this exposure seems to be well below therapeutic levels. It is expected that DTG will 
also be secreted into human milk based on animal data, although this has not yet been confirmed in 
humans. 
The reference safety information for DTG/ABC/3TC will recommend that, where possible, HIV infected 
women do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
DTG +ABC/3TC 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IP and withdrawal (WD) from the study were more 
commonly reported for the Atripla and EFV treatment groups compared to DTG +ABC/3TC, which had 
rates comparable to RAL +ABC/3TC and DRV + RTV +ABC/3TC 
With the exception of dizziness, fatigue, abnormal dreams, depression and headache in the ING114467 
Atripla group, all other individually reported AE PTs resulting in withdrawal or permanent 
discontinuation had a reporting rate of <1% across all treatment groups or were reported in one 
subject in ING112276, which had small treatment populations. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
There is no experience with the co-formulated DTG/ABC/3TC FDC tablets in HIV-infected patients. In 
total, within the bioequivalence study (ING114580) 66 healthy subjects have received the co-
formulated tablets.  The short term data showed no tolerability differences between the single entities 
and the FDC. The tolerability and safety of DTG/ABC/3TC FDC is expected to be similar to the safety 
and tolerability of the single entity DTG combined with ABC/3TC FDC.  
Therefore, the evidence for the safety of DTG/ABC/3TC FDC comes from studies in which HIV-infected 
subjects received DTG + ABC/3TC. Moreover, the safety data on the individual components is regarded 
as supportive. In total, 679 HIV-1 infected ART-naïve (INI naïve) subjects received DTG 50 mg once 
daily + ABC/3TC 600/300 mg once daily in studies, totalling exposure to 1066.5 person years. There is 
only limited experience with DTG+ABC/3TC in an ART-experienced (INI- naïve) patient populations.  A 
total of 9 ART-experienced (INI-naïve) subjects  received DTG + ABC/3TC. All subjects were 
HLA*B5701 negative. 
The most common adverse events occur at a similar or lower rate in the DTC+ABC/3TC groups 
compared to other treatment arms. The exception is insomnia, which was reported to occur more 
frequently compared to EFV, but the frequency was much higher than in the studies with DTG. Notably 
there was a much higher number of certain AEs, including possibly drug related AEs, in the Atripla arm 
in this study. There was one death amongst patients receiving DTG, ABC, 3TC which was unrelated to 
treatment. There was no clear trend for DTG +ABC/3TC regarding the drug related SAEs. 
The most important risk associated with ABC is a well characterized, idiosyncratic, drug-related 
hypersensitivity reaction. Appropriate risk minimisation includes pro-active screening for the presence 
of this allele and restricting abacavir to patients who are HLA-B*5701 negative unless no other 
treatment options are available. Boxed warnings are included in section 4.4 and 4.8 including detailed 
information describing the reactions and clinical management of hypersensitivity reactions. The 
potential severe hypersensitivity reaction to DTG in subject 4259 formed the main safety concern for 
the CHMP with implications for the RMP when assessing the dossier for dolutegravir. The detailed and 
adequate warning around these events has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Future follow-up 
of such reactions are an important part of the RMP. 
The MAH was requested to clarify how many patients with severe rash and HSR, that resulted in 
cessation of ABC, were allowed to continue DTG. Account of their follow up including time to resolution 
of symptoms was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 102/114 
 
  
  
Liver toxicity is a potential safety concern for DTG based on high dose repeat toxicity in cynomolgus 
monkeys, where dose related liver reactions were noted. This was not reflected in clinical studies, 
where liver safety appears comparable between DTG+ ABC/3TC and control arms.  
Since baseline characteristics of included subjects did not imply the inclusion of subjects with high 
myocardial risk and the period of observation was at most 96 weeks, not much can be said about the 
association of ABC and myocardial infarction. The same precautions as have been documented for ABC 
will apply to Triumeq.  
Mild to moderate episodes of rash were commonly reported for DTG+ABC/3TC FDC. The rate and 
nature of rash with DTG+ABC/3TC FDC was no different to that observed for comparators in the Phase 
III/IIIb development program or observed historically for the individual actives DTG, ABC and 3TC. 
An immediate, mild and non-progressive increase in creatinine is seen at low doses of dolutegravir. 
The increase of serum creatinine is not considered clinically relevant. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, tolerability and safety of DTG/ABC/3TC FDC is expected to be as the safety and tolerability of 
DTG combined with ABC/3TC FDC. The safety and tolerability of ABC/3TC is well characterized with 
considerable post marketing evidence, as well as a large amount of data from clinical trials.  
The safety of DTG has recently been reviewed in context of the MAA for DTG. The main identified 
safety concern of the CHMP was hypersensitivity, including hepatic toxicity. The most important risk 
associated with ABC is a well characterized, idiosyncratic, drug-related hypersensitivity reaction.  
Since the number of elderly subjects was limited in the pivotal SINGLE study, the FDC DTB/ABC/3TC 
may not be the preferred regimen especially in elderly HIV patient with additional cardiovascular risk 
factors. Future follow up of elderly patients should help to elucidate to contribution of ABC to increased 
cardiovascular risk. 
All of the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities listed in the RSI and SmPCs for the individual 
active moieties (DTG, ABC and 3TC) are also presented in the RSI and SmPC for DTG/ABC/3TC FDC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Triumeq is a fixed-dose combination of dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine (50/600/300 mg) 
intended as complete treatment regimen for treatment of HIV infection in adults and adolescents from 
12 years of age. The MAH proposed the use in a patient population “who are treatment-naïve or are 
infected with HIV without documented or clinically suspected resistance to any of the three 
antiretroviral agents in Triumeq.” 
The individual components (DTG and ABC/3TC FDC) are authorised for treatment of HIV-infection in 
adults and adolescents on a once-daily dosing regimen. In addition, both components, DTG 50 mg 
once daily and ABC/3TC FDC have been registered for use in patients experiencing virologic failure with 
the usual caveats on determination of resistance mutations which may preclude initiation of these 
ARVs in case of virologic failure on other combinations. 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the FDC tablet and the combination of the single entities 
DTG plus ABC/3TC FDC (KIVEXA) (Study ING114580). Therefore, the results of efficacy and safety of 
the combination of the single compounds also are applicable to the FDC. Data was provided on 
comparative studies of the combination DTG+ABC/3TC versus EFV+TDF/FTC (Atripla) (the pivotal 
SINGLE study) and versus RAL+ABC/3TC and DRV/r+ABC/3TC (SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO, 
respectively). 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the phase 3 program of dolutegravir, the combination found in Triumeq (abacavir/lamivudine + 
dolutegravir) showed superiority versus Atripla and yielded similar results as abacavir/lamivudine in 
combination with raltegravir or darunavir/ritonavir.  Similar response rates were also seen with the 
“Triumeq-combination” and the other preferred NRTI-backbone, tenofovir/emtricitabine, given with an 
integrase inhibitor (dolutegravir or raltegravir), or darunavir/ritonavir. However, the choice of NRTI 
backbone in those studies where according to the discretion of the investigator.  
Importantly, in the studies of interest for this application resistance development to the integrase class 
or the backbone NRTIs was fully lacking in those patients treated dolutegravir. Hence, the combination 
carries a high resistance barrier, which is of considerable clinical value.  
Triumeq provides a regimen as 1 tablet taken once daily, and without regards to food intake. This 
increases the quality of life for patients , the compliance to the treatment, and also minimizes the risk 
for erroneous intake/dosing. In addition, in comparison to many other preferred HIV regimens, 
Triumeq has a relatively low risk for interactions with other medications often used by patients with 
HIV infection.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
As for all HIV products there is only llimited data available for the Triumeq combination in the females 
and in the elderly.  This may be considered a safety issue, but likely not an efficacy issue. The same is 
true concerning in vivo efficacy data for HIV non-B subtypes. However, within the dolutegravir 
development program HIV subtypes other than B were fairly common in the SAILING study, without 
any signal for a lowered efficacy, which is in line with in vitro data. For abacavir/lamivudine HIV 
Assessment report

subtype has not been considered an issue.  For the specific Triumeq combination there is also limited 
data on efficacy in patients with severe immune suppression, taking into account the demographics in 
the phase 3 studies of relevance (SINGLE, SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO). However, from the dolutegravir 
development program as a whole there is convincing evidence that dolutegravir is highly effective in 
such patients. The shortcomings with regards to age groups and gender are reflected in the SmPC.   
In two previous studies the abacavir/lamivudine components showed a signal for suboptimal efficacy in 
patients with a high baseline viral load (>100,000 copies/ml), which was not seen with 
tenofovir/emtricitabine. The studies relevant for the Triumeq application do not contain a blinded 
comparison between these two pairs of NRTIs in combination with dolutegravir. The only study which 
was fully blinded (also for the NRTI-components) was the SINGLE study, where abacavir/lamivudine + 
dolutegravir was compared to tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz. Hence, it was not formally studied 
whether abacavir/lamivudine + dolutegravir (Triumeq) provides the same efficacy as 
tenofovir/emtricitabine + dolutegravirin patients with a high baseline viral load. However, the 
outcomes versus various preferred regimens in the studies presented are considered reassuring, in 
particular as no resistance development (to the integrase class or to the NRTIs) was seen in any 
patients who were treated with dolutegravir. The lack of a cautionary statement in Tirumeq SmPC is 
therefore endorsed. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Nausea (12%), diarrhoea (5%), insomnia (7%) and headache (6%) were the most commonly reported 
drug-related AEs in HLA-B*5701-negative INI naïve adult subjects treated with DTG+ABC/3TC in the 
phase IIb and III trials. Frequencies of AEs were similar or lower for DTG+ABC/3TC arms compared to 
comparators EFV/TDF/FTC, or to RAL, DRV + RTV or EFV + ABC/3TC. The overall safety profile of 
DTG+ABC/3TC appears comparable to RAL+ABC/3TC and comparable or somewhat favourable 
compared to DRV+rtv + ABC/3TC and EFV/ATRIPLA. 
The most important risk associated with ABC is a well-characterized, idiosyncratic, drug-related 
hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). HLA-B*5701 has been shown to be highly associated with ABC HSR, 
and the practice of pre-therapy screening for HLA-B*5701 and excluding from ABC therapy those 
individuals found to carry the allele, reduces the risk of HSR. Ten subjects receiving DTG+ABC/3TC 
reported AEs indicative of HSR, for which two were grade 3 to 4 intensity. Reporting rates were similar 
across studies and treatment groups. In the total DTG+ABC/3TC treatment group, HSR resulted in the 
permanent discontinuation of IP and subject withdrawal in 3 cases. The MAH was requested to clarify 
how many patients with severe rash and HSR resulting in cessation of ABC, were allowed to continue 
DTG. Information regarding their follow up, including time to resolution of symptoms, was provided for 
completeness. 
One severe hypersensitivity reaction involving a profuse, purpuric and coalescing leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis as well as a severe liver reaction (fulfilling Hy’s law criteria) was reasonably attributable to 
DTG. This finding is an important safety concern and is adequately addressed in the RMP.  
Severe skin reactions are recognized risks for the ABC constituent, and rash is a recognized adverse 
drug reaction for all three components of the DTG/ABC/3TC FDC. 
Liver toxicity is a potential safety concern for DTG based on high dose repeat toxicity in cynomolgus 
monkeys, with whom dose related liver reactions were noted.

An immediate, mild and non-progressive increase in creatinine is seen already at low doses of 
dolutegravir. This is due to inhibition of OCT2 without affecting creatinine clearance. The increase of 
serum creatinine is not considered clinically relevant. This FDC does not result in nephrotoxicity 
associated with other ARVs (e.g. tenofovir). 
The uncertainty around cardiovascular safety and abacavir in patients with high cardiovascular risk 
factors is reflected as in other abacavir containing products and is also included in the Triumeq SmPC 
as well.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The included HIV subjects were relatively young (median age 35 years), only 6 out of 833 patients in 
the SINGLE study were above 65 years of age. The associated cardiovascular risk of ABC may be 
increased in an elderly population or in younger patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors.  
The frequency and causality of putative dolutegravir-related HSR, including hepatotoxicity, is not 
known. 
There was a non-clinical signal for hepatotoxicity, however clinical studies do not indicate increased 
hepatotoxicity associated with the DTG/ABC/3TC regimen compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, a RAL 
containing regimen or a DRV+rtv containing regimen. Although the exposure with the dose used in 
humans compared with exposures seen at the NOAL in monkeys is substantially lower, liver toxicity 
will be followed up in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Benefit-risk balance 
The potent antiretroviral efficacy of the combination DTG/ABC/3TC including the high barrier to 
resistance, the tolerability of this combination in HLA*B5701 negative subjects, the lack of CYP3A4 
interactions and the simplicity of the dosing regimen make the FDC DTG/ABC/3TC a favourable 
addition to the antiretroviral armamentarium in HIV-infected patients. Potential DTG-related HSR has 
been recorded but the HSR of ABC in HLA*B5701 negative subjects is well established and sufficiently 
addressed in the SmPC. Future follow-up of hypersensitivity reactions are an important part of the 
RMP. The overall safety profile of DTG/ABC/3TC is considered comparable to RAL+ABC/3TC and 
somewhat favourable compared to DRV/rtv + ABC/3TC and Atripla. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Single tablet regimens are known to support patient’s acceptance and compliance. Two additional 
features make this STR of additional benefit to patients: no need to take DTG/ABC/3TC with food (in 
contrast to DRV) or on a empty stomach (in contrast to Atripla) and the lack of CYP3A4 interactions. 
The FDC DTG/ABC/3TC offers a new STR treatment option in the HLA-B*5701-negative population with 
a high efficacy and a high barrier to resistance. The absence of TDF might be beneficial in some 
patients at risk of renal insufficiency or osteopenia, although this FDC of DTG/ABC/3TC cannot be 
administered in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min due to dose restrictions of 3TC. A DTG-
based regimen might also offer a suitable alternative for patients failing on ARVs with virus resistance 
to NNRTIs or protease inhibitors. Although data on the combination of DTG plus ABC/3TC in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/580654/2014 
Page 110/114 
 
  
  
treatment-experienced population failing on a first line regimen that did not include an INI, is lacking, 
it is considered acceptable to extrapolate the efficacy in the treatment-naïve to the treatment-
experienced patients, as long as existing mutations do not preclude the start of any of the three 
antiretroviral agents within the combination. Additional support for this extrapolation can be derived 
from the licensing of both compounds for patients experiencing virologic failure. This is adequately 
addressed in the SmPC. Furthermore in patients who are HLA*B5701 negative switch from other STRs 
to DTG/ABC/3TC may be possible in case of intolerability of other regimens while virus is suppressed, 
because of tolerability benefits. 
Hence, the proposed indication by the MAH that explicitly addresses both treatment-naïve patients and 
patients failing on other regimens, is considered over-complete. The concise indication of the individual 
components (‘the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults and adolescents 
above 12 years of age’) should also apply to this FDC. Further elaboration of efficacy in patients 
experiencing virologic failure, the relative lack of clinical data in case of virologic failure in first line 
regimens and a clinical appraisal of documented resistance mutations in these patients should be 
addressed in section 4.4 and 5.1 to guide treatment decisions. 
Two potential drawbacks of the combination of abacavir plus lamivudine are known; inferior efficacy in 
patients with high baseline viral load and the possible association with increased risk of myocardial 
infarction both in comparison with other NRTIs as backbone. Whether the benefits described above 
also apply to patients with high baseline viral load when ABC/3TC is used with the potent antiretroviral 
agent DTG is yet insufficiently substantiated in the submitted studies or cannot be refuted because of 
low numbers of patients with unfavourable disease characteristics. However, the outcomes versus 
various preferred regimens in the studies presented are considered reassuring. The same reservations 
about use of the FDC DTG/ABC/3TC in patients with cardiovascular risk factors apply, since few elderly 
patients were exposed. These precautions have been incorporated in the SmPC of the FDC 
DTG/ABC/3TC. 
There are no quality issues which impact the safety profile and influence the benefit/risk balance.

2. 
Risk factors for ABC HSR  
HLA-B*5701 is the only identified pharmacogenetic marker that is consistently associated with clinical 
diagnosis of an ABC HSR reaction. However, some patients with a suspected ABC hypersensitivity 
reaction may not have the HLA-B*5701 allele. 
3. 
Recommendations for HLA-B*5701 screening 
Before initiating abacavir therapy, clinicians should screen for HLA-B*5701(in settings where validated 
screening methods are available). Clinical diagnosis of suspected hypersensitivity to ABC remains the 
basis for clinical decision making. HLA-B*5701 screening for risk of ABC hypersensitivity should never 
be substituted for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management in individuals receiving ABC. 
If ABC hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, ABC should be permanently 
discontinued and should not be restarted, regardless of the results of HLA-B*5701 screening. 
Screening is also recommended prior to re-initiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 
status who have previously tolerated abacavir. 
4. 
Information on HLA-B*5701 testing 
The one-time HLA-B*5701 test identifies people at high risk for this serious allergic reaction. The gold 
standards for HLA-B*5701 screening are sequence-based genotyping and polymerase chain reaction 
sequencing of specific oligonucleotide probes. Blood or saliva samples are collected and tested for 
genetic sequences coding for the HLA-B*5701 allele. Results of PREDICT-1 and SHAPE studies show 
that the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele is associated with increased risk of ABC hypersensitivity, 
regardless of race, screening for HLA-B*5701 before starting treatment with ABC may identify subjects 
at increased risk of a HSR, avoiding treatment with ABC in subjects with the HLA-B*5701 allele was 
shown to significantly reduce the incidence rate of clinically diagnosed cases of hypersensitivity. Data 
from these studies do not support the use of skin patch testing in routine clinical practice. Only 
patients found to lack the HLA-B*5701 allele should begin therapy with ABC. 
5. 
Management of ABC HSR reaction 
Symptoms can occur at any time during treatment with ABC, but usually occur within the first 6 weeks 
of therapy. Symptoms are initially mild and evolve over days, becoming more severe with continued 
ABC therapy. Symptoms improve on cessation of ABC. Rechallenge can result in a more rapid and 
severe reaction, which can be fatal, therefore rechallenge is contraindicated. 
6. 
Hypersensitivity case studies 
The educational material includes 3 case studies to demonstrate different clinical scenarios and their 
management.

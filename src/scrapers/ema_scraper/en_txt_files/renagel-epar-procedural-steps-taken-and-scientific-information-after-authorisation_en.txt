representatives in the Package Leaflet has been 
updated. Furthermore, the WSA proposed this 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 8.0. Minor linguistic corrections 
have also been made to the Italian Annexes of 
Renvela. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
airways or aspiration of tablet remnants in association with 
treatment with Renagel/Renvela. A total of seven cases 
were identified.  Four of these patients recovered, for 2 the 
outcomes are unknown, and 1 case was fatal (acute MI). In 
five cases, patients had to be hospitalized/hospitalization 
was prolonged and/or patients underwent 
bronchoscopy/endoscopy. The CHMP subsequently 
identified 12 cases in EudraVigilance on 17 March 2011. 
The CHMP requested the MAH to perform a cumulative 
review of cases of possible complications of swallowing 
Renagel/Renvela tablets, in particular focusing on the 
MedDRA PTs dysphagia, choking, aspiration, foreign body 
aspiration and oral administration complication. 
Swallowing is complex mechanical event, which can be 
influenced by a great many factors in Chronic Kidney 
Disease (CKD) patients. It is known for example that these 
patients often suffer from dysfunctional salivary glands. 
Furthermore, since hypertension is a frequent co-morbidity 
in CKD, water retention in the salivary gland’s secretory 
process is not uncommon. Furthermore, concomitant 
conditions common in CKD patients (e.g. xerostomia, 
diabetic autonomic neuropathy, GERD and iron deficiency) 
can affect swallowing. CKD patients are generally also an 
older population with age related physiological changes 
such as laryngeal nerve dysfunction contributing to 
Page 8/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dysphagia and swallowing complications. 
The MAH performed a number of searches in different 
media to identify relevant case reports. The MAH’s global 
safety database was queried for adverse events coding to 
specific Preferred Terms and MedDRA High Level Group 
Terms. In addition a search of medical literature was 
performed using Pubmed, OVID, EMBASE, and Biosis to 
identify any publications discussing choking on or difficulty 
swallowing and sevelamer. 
In addition, both the Renagel Integrated Summary of 
Safety submitted with the Renagel MAA and the Renagel 
and Renvela post-approval safety studies were reviewed. 
Finally, The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) 
database was also queried. During this query similar data 
regarding other drugs currently indicated for treatment of 
hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients was also retained. 
The CHMP conclusion is that the MAH has taken adequate 
action in regards to these sporadic reports of swallowing 
difficulties by adding a precaution on the use of tablet in 
swallowing-impaired patients in the product SPC. There are 
no clinical nor quality related reason as to why 
Renvela/Renagel should be more difficult to swallow than 
other similar products.

was requested by the CHMP to update section 4.8 of the

"diverticulitis" under post-marketing experience. The MAH 
has hereby submitted a type II variation to update section 
4.8 of the SPC accordingly and has also proposed 
consequential changes to the Package Leaflet. The CHMP 
considered this type II variation to be acceptable and

compare the effects of sevelamer hydrochloride and 
calcium carbonate on bone turnover and mineralization in 
haemodialysis patients. The results suggest that sevelamer 
hydrochloride and calcium carbonate had comparable 
effects on bone mineralization and bone turnover. Another

Information was added to section 4.4 (Special warnings 
4.5 of the SPC with consequent changes to the PL in 
order to include information on worsening metabolic 
acidosis when switching from other phosphate 
binders where lower bicarbonate levels were 
observed in sevelamer-treated patients compared to 
calcium-treated patients, as well as on relevant 
interactions between sevelamer, cyclosporin A and 
mycophenolate mofetil following the CHMP's 
assessment of the 4th and 5th annual re-
and special precautions for use) of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) on that patients with chronic renal 
failure are predisposed to develop metabolic acidosis. 
Worsening of acidosis has been reported upon switching 
from other phosphate binders to sevelamer in a number of 
studies where lower bicarbonate levels in sevelamer-
treated patients compared to patients treated with calcium-
based binders were observed. Close monitoring of serum 
bicarbonate levels is recommended.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Information was added to section 4.5 (Interactions with 
other medicinal products and other forms of interaction) on 
that reduced levels of cyclosporine and mycophenolate 
mofetil have been reported in transplant patients when 
coadministered with Renagel without any known clinical 
consequences (i.e graft rejection). The possibility of an 
interaction with clinical consequences cannot be excluded 
and a close monitoring of blood concentrations of 
mycophenolate-mofetil and cyclosporine should be 
considered during the use of combination and after its 
withdrawal.

that the average actual daily dose in the chronic phase of a 
one-year clinical study was 7 grams of sevelamer.In section 
4.5 of the SPC information was added based on interaction 
studies in healthy volunteers. Renagel had no effect on the 
bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol. 
However, the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin was decreased 
by approximately 50% when co-administered with Renagel 
in a single dose study. Consequently, Renagel should not 
be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin. Renagel may 
affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When 
administering any medicinal product where a reduction in 
the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect 
on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be

that in very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and 
ileus/subileus have been observed in patients during 
treatment and that constipation may be a preceding 
symptom. Thus, patients who are constipated should be 
monitored carefully while being treated with Renagel and 
treatment should be re-evaluated in patients who develop 
severe constipation.

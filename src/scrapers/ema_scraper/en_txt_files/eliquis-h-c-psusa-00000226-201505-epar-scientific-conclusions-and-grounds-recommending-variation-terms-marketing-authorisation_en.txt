Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for apixaban, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting period of the PSUR for apixaban, a number of pruritus cases (n=85) were 
reported and 20 were assessed as possibly related to the medication. In 15 of these a positive de-
challenge or re-challenge was observed and no confounding factor (use of co-medication or co-
morbidities such as the occurrence of hypersensitivity) was described. In light of the reported data, 
it is recommended that ‘pruritus’ should be specifically included in section 4.8 of the SmPC under 
the SOC ‘Immune system disorders’ with the frequency of “uncommon”. The Package Leaflet is to 
be updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding pruritus, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for apixaban the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing apixaban is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

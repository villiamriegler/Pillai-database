INTRODUCTION 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, Merck Sharp & Dohme, is submitting 
the results of the end of study at 5 years of the IMPAACT P1066 protocol. (P022). This study evaluated 
the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of raltegravir (also known as ISENTRESS®, and as MK- 
518) in paediatric participants 4 weeks to <19 years of age treated with raltegravir given as 400-mg 
tablets, as chewable tablets (weight-based dosing), or as granules for oral suspension (GFS) (weight-
based  dosing),  in  combination  with  an  optimized  background  therapy  (OBT)  regimen.  Two  clinical 
study  reports  (CSRs)  have  been  previously  prepared  and  were  included  in  the  following  Extension 
Applications:  EMEA/H/C/000860/X/0024/G  (CSR  P022)  and  EMEA/H/C/000860/X/0044/G  (CSR 
P022V01).  This  regulatory  filing  will  be  the  final  reporting  of  results  associated  with  P022  (CSR 
P022V02). 
The  MAH  states  that  the  data  submitted  do  not  influence  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  raltegravir  and 
therefore do not require taking further regulatory action on the marketing authorization at this stage.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. Introduction 
Raltegravir  is  a  HIV  integrase  strand  transfer  inhibitor  approved  in  both  treatment-  experienced  and 
treatment-naïve  adult  patients.  Raltegravir  received  initial  marketing  authorization  in  2007  in  adult 
treatment-experienced  and  in  July  2009  in  treatment-naïve  adult  patients  at  a  dose  of  400  mg  BID. 
Based  on  complete  24  week  and  partial  48  week  data  from  a  Phase  I/II  study  in  HIV-1  infected 
children  and  adolescents,  IMPAACT  P1066  (Merck  Protocol  022),  raltegravir  received  marketing 
authorization in the  European Union (February 2013) for the treatment of paediatric patients 2 to 18 
years of age. Subsequently, the granules for suspension (GFS paediatric formulation was approved for 
use  in  infants  at  least  4  weeks  of  age  for  weight  based  (~6  mg/kg)  twice daily  oral  dosing.  The  GFS 
formulation was approved in the US on 20-Dec-2013 (NDA 205- 786), and in the EU on 22-Aug-2014 
(EMEA/H/C/000860/X/0044/G). 
2. Scientific discussion 
IMPAACT P1066 STUDY DESIGN SUMMARY 
The overall IMPAACT P1066 trial was a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study to 
evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics,  and  antiretroviral  activity  of  raltegravir  in  HIV-1 
infected  infants,  children,  and  adolescents  (4  weeks  to  18  years).      The  study  enrolled  152  HIV-1-
infected  pediatric  patients  ages  ≥4  weeks  to  <19  years  of  age.  All  subjects  enrolled  into  the  study 
were stratified at screening into one of five age groups, in six cohorts:

This  Article  46  submission  includes  data  presented  in  CSR  P022V02  from  all  participants  exposed  to 
raltegravir (at any dose, Stage I or Stage II); this group is denoted as the All Treated Population and is 
most  inclusive  and  appropriate  for  this  final  reporting.  In  prior  submissions,  data  were  presented  for 
the  Final  Dose  Population  (a  sub-population)  and  separately  for  the  All  Treated  Population.  The  Final 
Dose  Population  included  participants  accrued  into  Stage  I  and  treated  only  at  the  dose  ultimately 
selected for their cohorts, as well as those accrued into Stage II in which participants received only the 
final selected dose for the respective cohort. Results from the Final Dose Population were   considered 
primary for evaluation of the primary and secondary study objectives at Week 24 and Week 48. 
Study Population Characteristics 
Overall, a total of 153 previously treated (except Cohort V), HIV-1 positive participants were enrolled 
in  P022:  126  participants  into  Cohorts  I  (N=71),  IIA  (N=16),  IIB  (N=18),  and  III  (N=21),  and  27 
participants into Cohorts IV (N=15) and V (including Supplemental Cohort V) (N=12). It is noteworthy 
that 46.7% of the participants (Cohort 1), were adolescents. One participant in Cohort IV was enrolled 
but  did  not  receive  study  drug;  therefore  152  infants,  children  and  adolescents  were  enrolled  and 
treated in this study as detailed in the previous CSRs. 
By week 240, 87 (57.2%) of the 152 treated participants remained in the study: 44 (50.6%) of the 87 
participants  who  received  the  400-mg  tablet  in  Cohorts  I  and  IIA,  29  (74.4%)  of  the  39  participants 
who  received  the  chewable  tablet  in  Cohorts  IIB  and  III,  and  14  (51.9%)  of  the  26  participants  who 
received  GFS  in  Cohorts  IV  and  V.  More  discontinuations  were  observed  for  the  400-mg  tablet group 
(Cohort I and IIA) due to noncompliance than in any other formulation group (21.8% of participants). 
The  chewable  tablet  group  and  GFS  group  discontinuations  due  to  noncompliance  were  lower  as 
follows: 2.6% and 3.7%, respectively. 
Of the 152 treated participants, 82 (53.9%) were  male, 97 (63.8%) were Black or  African American, 
and  55  (36.2%)  were  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity.  The  median  age  by  formulation  (400-mg 
tablet/chewable tablet/GFS) was 14 years, 5 years and 28 weeks, respectively. 
Mean  baseline  log10  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  values  by  formulation  (400-mg  tablet/chewable  tablet/GFS) 
were  4.3,  4.3  and  5.7  log10  copies/mL,  respectively.  The  numbers  of  participants  who  had  baseline 
HIV-1  RNA  above  100,000  copies/mL  by  formulation  (400-  mg  tablet/chewable  tablet/GFS)  were  8 
(9.2%), 5 (12.8%), and 18 (69.2%), respectively. Baseline viral load was 1 to 2 log higher for Cohorts 
IV and V compared with the older children and adolescents in Cohorts I through III, in whom baseline 
HIV-1 RNA values exceeded 100,000 copies/mL in only 10.3%. The higher baseline viral load observed 
in  the  youngest  children  in  this  study  is  consistent  with  the  natural  history  of  HIV-1  infection  in 
paediatrics. 
Mean  baseline  CD4  cell  count  values  by  formulation  (400-mg  tablet/chewable  tablet/GFS)  were 
approximately  454,  856,  and  1515  cells/mm3,  respectively.  Mean  baseline  CD4  percentages  by 
formulation (400-mg tablet/chewable tablet/GFS) were 20.9%, 27.4%, and 20.7%, respectively. 
Viral subtype was clade B for 104 (68.4%) of the 152 treated participants, non-clade B for 42 (27.6%) 
participants, and not available for 6 (3.9%) participants.  
Most  participants  were  previously  treated  with  multiple  antiretroviral  (ARV)  therapies  (ARTs), 
particularly  the  oldest  age  group  (Cohort  I  and  IIA)  using  the  400-mg  tablet  formulation.  In  these  2 
cohorts,  81.6%  of  participants  were  treated  with  ≥3  classes  of  ARV  prior to  study  entry;  overall,  the 
mean number of prior ARVs used was 8.7 and the mean duration of prior ARV therapy was 11.4 years. 
The mean durations of prior ARV therapy and mean number of prior ARV agents used by formulation 
(400-mg  tablet/chewable  tablet/GFS)  were  11.4  years/8.7  agents,  4.6  years/5.1  agents,  and  13.7 
weeks/1.7  agents,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  (≥35%)  concomitant  ARVs  use  in  the 
152 treated participants included: lamivudine (56.6%), lopinavir/ritonavir (48.7%), ritonavir (43.4%), 
abacavir (38.2%), and tenofovir (36.2%). According to classification of paediatric HIV-1 by the Centers 
for  Disease  Control  (CDC),  43  (28.3%)  of  the  152  treated  participants  were  classified  as  clinical 
category A, 41 (27%) as B, 44 (28.9%) as C, and 24 (15.8%) as N.

Efficacy 
Raltegravir, administered either as 400-mg tablets, chewable tablets, or GFS, in combination with an 
OBT, continued to demonstrate a durable antiretroviral effect and immunological benefit through Week 
240 in HIV-1 infected infants, children, and adolescents who initiated therapy at ≥4 weeks to 18 years 
of  age.  Review  of  the  available  raltegravir  resistance  data  indicates  only  1  additional  participant  in 
Cohort V failed virologically with a raltegravir resistance mutation at AA155 since the previous CSR. 
At Week 24, >67% of participants across cohorts achieved HIV-1 RNA values of <400 copies/mL. For 
Cohorts I and IIA receiving 400-mg tablets, 69.0% achieved HIV-1 RNA  <400 copies/mL at Week 24 
with 42.4% maintaining HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL at Week 240 (Observed Failure [OF]). For Cohorts 
IIB  and  III  receiving  chewable  tablets,  66.7%  achieved  HIV-1  RNA  <400  copies/mL  at  Week  24  with 
75.0% maintaining HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL at Week 240 (OF). For Cohorts IV and V receiving GFS, 
64.0%  achieved  HIV-1  RNA  <400  copies/mL  at  Week  24  with  80.0%  maintaining  HIV-1  RNA  <400 
copies/mL at Week 240 (OF). Virologic suppression over time was similar for participants receiving the 
chewable tablet and GFS formulations. In comparison, the 400-mg tablet formulation appeared to have 
lower  proportions  of  participants  achieving  suppression  past  the  Week  24  time  point.  This  is  not 
unexpected due to the high proportion of adolescent participants receiving this formulation (Cohort I, 
71  or  46.7%  of  all  treated  participants).  Adolescent  participants  had  the  most  extensive  prior 
treatment  (12  year  mean  duration  of  prior  ARV  use  with  a  mean  of  9  prior  ARV  agents),  and  poorer 
compliance (15.5% <80% compliant) compared with the younger cohorts, in particular Cohorts III, IV 
and  V  who  most  likely  had  greater,  if  not  complete,  adult  supervision  of  dosing.  Overall,  sustained 
responses  (HIV-1  RNA  <400  copies/mL)  in  approximately  58%  of  remaining  participants  were 
observed up to Week 240 (OF). 
An  overall  trend  of  increase  in  CD4  cell  count  for  each  formulation  was  observed  up  to  Week  48. 
Participants who received the 400-mg tablet and chewable tablet had sustained increases in CD4 cell 
count,  although  decreased  over  time,  for  the  remainder  of  the  study.  Participants  receiving  GFS 
experienced  overall  decreases  in  absolute  CD4  cell  count  after  Week  48.  This  is  not  unexpected  in 
these  youngest  participants  due  to  the  expected  decline  in  total  percentage  of  lymphocytes  during 
normal  growth  and  development.  For  this  reason,  CD4  percentage  over  time  is  a  more  useful 
parameter for very young children. For Cohorts I and IIA receiving 400-mg tablets, the mean increase 
in CD4 cell count was 128.0 cells/mm3 at Week 24 and 31.0 cells/mm3 at Week 240 (OF). For Cohorts 
IIB  and  III  receiving  chewable  tablets,  the  mean  increase  in  CD4  cell  count  was  160.3  cells/mm3  at 
Week 24 and 6.7 cells/mm3 at Week 240 (OF). For Cohorts IV and V receiving GFS, the mean change 
in CD4 cell count was 445.7 cells/mm3 at Week 24 and -143.8 cells/mm3 at Week 240 (OF). 
From  Week  24,  each  formulation  was  associated  with  at  least  a  3%  increase  from  baseline  in  CD4 
percent.  The  increase  was  sustained  up  to  Week  240.  Importantly,  the  youngest  participants,  who 
entered the study below 2 years of age and received the GFS formulation, demonstrated an increase of 
8.6% in CD4 percentage at Week 240 despite the decline in absolute CD4 cell count during this period. 
For Cohorts I and IIA receiving 400- mg tablets, the mean increase in CD4 percent was 4.3% at Week 
24 and 3.6% at Week 240 (OF). For Cohorts IIB and III receiving chewable tablets, the mean increase 
in  CD4  percent  was  4.1%  at  Week  24  and  6.0%  at  Week  240  (OF).  For  Cohorts  IV  and  V  receiving 
GFS, mean increase in CD4 percent was 7.5% at Week 24 and 8.6% at Week 240 (OF). 
Overall, 72 (47.4%) participants experienced virologic failure by Week 240 as follows: 
• Cohorts I and IIA (400-mg tablets), 44 (50.6%) participants. 
• Cohorts IIB and III (chewable tablets), 17 (43.6%) participants. 
• Cohorts IV and V (GFS), 11 (42.3%) participants. 
For  participants  who  experienced  virologic  failures  and  had  genotypic  data  obtained  (N=62),23 
(37.1%)  across  all  cohorts  displayed  signature  raltegravir  genotypic  mutations  as  follows:  7  (11.3%) 
at AA148, 9 (14.5%) at AA155, 2 (3.2%) at AA143 and 5 (8.1%) at both AA148 and AA155. 
Since  the  P022V01  CSR,  which  included  a  cumulative  review  of  raltegravir  resistance  across  all 
cohorts,  1  additional  participant  (Cohort  V)  failed  treatment  virologically  with  a  raltegravir  resistance 
mutation  at  AA155.  Although  some  secondary  raltegravir  mutations  known  to  confer  raltegravir 
resistance  were  detected  (ie,  L74I,  T97A)  in  participants  without  primary  mutations,  these  mutations 
are not known to confer clinically significant resistance to raltegravir by themselves.

Safety 
Raltegravir  administered  as  400-mg  tablets,  chewable  tablets,  or  as  GFS,  at  the  recommended  dose, 
continues  to  be  generally  safe  and  well  tolerated  at  Week  240  as  long-term  therapy  in  combination 
with an OBT regimen in paediatric participants. No new safety concerns were identified based upon the 
review of Week 240 complete study data. 
Clinical  AEs  of  any  grade  (Grades  1–4)  were  reported  by  146  (96.1%)  of  All  Treated  participants  by 
Week 240 as follows: 
• Cohorts I and IIA (400-mg tablets), 81 (93.1%) participants. 
• Cohorts IIB and III (chewable tablets), 39 (100.0%) participants. 
• Cohorts IV and V (GFS), 26 (100.0%) participants. 
As of Week 240, 41 (27.0%) participants had experienced clinical SAEs, many of which may have been 
related  to  underlying  diseases.  The  rate  of  clinical  SAEs  was  generally  comparable  across  each 
formulation  and  age  group.  Three  drug-related  clinical  SAEs  were  experienced  by  2  (1.3%) 
participants. One Cohort II participant experienced clinical SAEs of drug-related rash (on Day 17), and 
drug-related drug-induced liver injury (on Day 141), but neither resulted in treatment interruption or 
discontinuation.  There  was  one  SAE  of  a  Grade  3,  drug-related  allergic  drug  rash  (Day  7)  for  a 
participant  in  Cohort  V,  which  led  to  discontinuation  of  raltegravir.  In  addition  to  the  above  drug-
related clinical SAEs, drug related non-serous Grade 3 or greater AEs were reported for 2 participants. 
One participant in Cohort I experienced 3 drug-related Grade 3 or greater clinical AEs of psychomotor 
hyperactivity,  abnormal  behavior  and  insomnia  (on  Day  41)  which  did  not  limit  treatment,  and  1 
participant in Cohort V experienced drug-related Grade 3 or greater immune reconstitution syndrome 
(on Day 29) which resolved before Week 24 without treatment interruption. 
There  were  no  additional drug-related  Grade 3  or  greater  clinical  AEs  or  drug-related  clinical  SAEs  or 
discontinuations due to clinical AEs reported since the last CSR. 
By Week 240 for all formulations, laboratory AEs of any grade (Grades 1 through 4) were reported by 
145 (95.4%) of All Treated participants as follows: 
• Cohorts I and IIA (400-mg tablets), 82 (94.3%) participants. 
• Cohorts IIB and III (chewable tablets), 38 (97.4%) participants. 
• Cohorts IV and V (GFS), 25 (96.2%) participants. 
Overall, 4 (2.6%) participants had laboratory SAEs, none of which were considered drug related. Four 
participants  (2.6%)  experienced  drug-related  Grade  3  or  greater  laboratory  events  of  ALT  and  AST 
increased  (1  participant),  LDL  increased  (1  participant),  and  neutrophil  count  decreased  (2 
participants). No new drug-related Grade 3 or greater laboratory AEs were reported since the last CSR. 
No  drug-related  laboratory  SAEs,  and  no  discontinuations  or  deaths  were  reported  due  to  laboratory 
AEs throughout the study. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Raltegravir, an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor, continues to provide convincing evidence of its 
benefits in HIV-1 infected paediatric participants. The final, 240- week efficacy and safety results from 
P022,  which  evaluated  raltegravir’s  use  in  paediatric  participants  4  weeks  to  <19  years  of  age,  are 
consistent  with  data  presented 
submissions 
EMEA/H/C/000860/X/0024/G (CSR P022) and EMEA/H/C/000860/X/0044/G (CSR P022V01), as well as 
those  reported  for  HIV-infected  adults.  These  results  thereby  continue  to  support  the  conclusion  that 
there  is  a  favorable  benefit/risk  ratio  with  administration  of  raltegravir  at  the  appropriate 
recommended dose in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients in these age groups. 
the  previous  CSRs  and 
regulatory 
in 
On  the  basis  of  the  results  of  this  paediatric  study,  there  is  no  change  in  the  benefit-risk  profile  of 
Isentress for the existing indications. Therefore, no SmPC changes are needed based on the results of 
this study at present.

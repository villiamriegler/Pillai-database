Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Melanoma is a rare diagnosis in the pediatric population accounting for 3% of all pediatric cancers. 
While the incidence is very low in the first decade of life (between 0.7 and 0.8 cases per million), this 
rises sharply to over 10 cases per million in the second decade, consistent with sun exposure as the 
primary driver.1,2,3 In Europe, the age-adjusted incidence rates in 2020 were 20.0 per 100,000 
persons for all ages (150,627 cases), 0.1 per 100,000 for ages < 15 years (169 cases), and 0.5 per 
100,000 for ages < 20 years (805 cases).4 
Pediatric melanoma shares many similarities with adult melanoma. As in adults, most pediatric cases 
(about 75%) are localized and have an excellent outcome. The majority of childhood and adolescent 
melanoma occurs sporadically, with most attributed to UV pathophysiology exposure, especially in 
adolescents. Familial cases account for only 1% of melanoma in children, but approximately 25% of 
pediatric patients have a preexisting condition known to be associated with melanoma. The strongest 
risk factor for melanoma in adolescents is the presence of more than 100 nevi with a diameter greater 
than 2 mm.5 
The genomic landscape of conventional melanoma in children is represented by many of the genomic 
alterations that are found in adults with melanoma.  
Paediatric melanoma presents a clinical and histopathological challenge due to its rarity and atypical 
presentations. Melanomas affecting the pediatric age can be classified in 3 subtypes: Spitzoid 
melanoma, melanoma arising in congenital melanocytic nevi, and conventional (adult-type) melanoma. 
In patients 11 years and older, conventional melanoma is the prevailing subtype, which shares 
morphologic (superficial spreading and nodular) and molecular features with adult melanoma and is 
mainly located on the trunk.6 
Common risk factors for melanoma in paediatric and adult patients are intermittent intense sun 
exposure, tendency to sunburn, tendency to freckle, fair skin, blue or green eyes, and blond or red 
hair. Genetic predisposing conditions for developing melanoma, specifically in the paediatric 
population, do more frequently manifest in early childhood than in adolescence. 
The OS in pediatric and adolescent melanoma is similar to what is seen in adults.7,8,9 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Primary tumor characteristics, such as the site of the primary tumor, stage at diagnosis, tumor 
thickness, or level of invasion were compared between pediatric and adult melanoma patients. The 
group of prepubescent patients appears to be in this context as a separate group with thicker tumor 
lesions, whereas primary tumor characteristics between adolescent and adult melanoma patients are

comparable. Stage II and III melanoma in adults and adolescents can be considered as the same 
disease, sharing the same prognostic factors and the high risk of recurrence and death.10 
Similar to adults, the main predictor of outcomes in melanoma is the stage at the time of diagnosis.11 
Five-year overall survival for all stages is 87% to 95%. Data collected in 219 pediatric melanoma 
patients from 2002 to 2012 by the European Cooperative Study Group reported 3-year OS of 100.0% 
for Stage I, 90.0% for Stage II, 92.1% for Stage III, and 57.1% for Stage IV tumors. Data from the 
2004-2016 National Cancer Database collected from 1903 pediatric melanoma patients reported 5-year 
OS greater than 90.0% for Stage I-III tumors and of 34.4% for Stage IV tumors.12 
Clinical studies in pediatric and adolescent melanoma patients as reported in the literature were 
analyzed to assess the response to intervention. Although the number of patients in these studies was 
small and the studies did not have a randomized design, treatment effects such as objective response 
or pharmacodynamic effects of immunotherapy appeared to be comparable to adult patients.10,7,8,9  
−  The few clinical studies with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in paediatric patients with 
melanoma showed a comparable safety profile to adult patients. Objective responses in 
individual patients were reported. However, the design of the reported studies and the small 
number of adolescent melanoma patients enrolled do not allow for a conclusive comparison of 
efficacy to adult studies.13,14,15 
−  Clinical studies with IFNα2b and high-dose IL-2 in paediatric patients showed the feasibility and 
overall comparable safety profile to adult patients. Pharmacodynamic effects of 
immunotherapy in children were reported to be comparable to adult patients.16,17,18,19,20 
−  The safety and effectiveness of the checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab as a single agent have been 
established in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older for the treatment of 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma.21 
Management 
Melanoma in adolescents and adults is generally regarded as an analogous disease and is treated 
similarly using multimodal therapy including surgery, systemic therapy, and in some cases, radiation. 
As such, current treatment strategies for pediatric and adolescent melanoma are based on clinical

guidelines for adult patients,22,23,24 and there are limited clinical studies evaluating treatment 
outcomes in these age groups. Despite the small number of patients, results of these studies showed 
that safety profiles and treatment effects in pediatric patients are comparable with adult patients. The 
mainstay of treatment of pediatric cutaneous melanoma is cure by surgical resection. Given the lack of 
pediatric-specific clinical trials guiding surgical management, adult guidelines are applied to children 
with some modifications based on expected differences in cosmetic and functional outcomes in younger 
patients.5 Pediatric patients with Stages III and IV melanoma are considered for additional therapy. 
Prior to 2011, approved therapies were limited to dacarbazine chemotherapy and interleukine-2 
immunotherapy as treatment of metastatic melanoma and interferon α-2b as adjuvant treatment. 
Since then, two distinct therapeutic classes have been developed with demonstrated efficacy in adult 
adjuvant and advanced settings: checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 
coinhibitory receptor pathways and targeted therapies inhibiting tyrosine kinase signaling pathways 
(such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors).25 
Treatment of Advanced (Unresectable or Metastatic) Melanoma 
The checkpoint inhibitors, including ipilimumab, nivolumab, nivolumab in combination with relatlimab 
fixed dose combination, and pembrolizumab, and the BRAF (dabrafenib, vemurafenib, and encorafenib) 
and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib) targeted therapies were evaluated in adult 
unresectable and metastatic melanoma. The 3 checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy (ipilimumab, 
nivolumab, and pembrolizumab) and the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination were approved in 
adults in the US and EU. Nivolumab and relatlimab fixed-dose combination was approved in the US and 
received CHMP positive opinion on 21-Jul-2022 in the EU. Three BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations were 
approved in the US and EU for adult use in advanced melanoma (dabrafenib + trametinib, vemurafenib 
+ cobimetinib, and encorafenib + binimetinib), with little to indicate whether one combination would 
be better suited to pediatric use than another.22,24  Despite the availability of new treatment options 
for advanced melanoma in adults, current experience with immunotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in 
particular, in the pediatric setting is very limited. 
For the treatment of advanced melanoma in pediatric patients (12 years and older), the checkpoint 
inhibitors, ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, were approved in the US and EU. Nivolumab and relatlimab 
fixed-dose combination was approved in the US and received CHMP positive opinion on 21-Jul-2022 
(European Commission decision pending). To date, there are limited data on the safety and efficacy of 
BRAF-targeted therapies (eg, vemurafenib and dabrafenib) in adolescent melanoma patients (≥ 12 to 
< 18 years).26 Real world data from the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) (N = 3775) 
showed that the proportion of adolescents and young adults (N = 210 with 3 patients from 15 to 18 
years old and 207 patients from 18 to 39 years old) initially treated with BRAF or MEK inhibitors and 
immune checkpoint inhibitors in the Netherlands were 35.2% and 33.8%, respectively.27

Pediatric patients with melanoma have been absent from most of the prospective trials, and current 
treatment strategies for younger patients again must extrapolate from adult data.28 Adjuvant therapy 
for adult melanoma has changed dramatically in the past five years. Interferon α-2b remained the 
standard adjuvant therapy for high-risk melanoma until FDA approval of the CTLA-4 inhibitor 
ipilimumab in 2015. In adults, the adjuvant use of ipilimumab or PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab) as well as the adjuvant use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in 
Phase 3 studies. The 2 checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, were approved in the US 
and EU for adults in the adjuvant setting. The combination of the BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK 
(trametinib) inhibitors was approved in the US and EU for adult BRAF-mutant Stage III melanoma 
following complete resection.22,24 The FDA and recently EMA approved the expanded indication of 
pembrolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with Stage 
IIB, IIC based on KEYNOTE-716 study29 and Stage III melanoma based on KEYNOTE-054 study30 
following complete resection.

Similarity of melanoma between adolescents and adults 
The following discussion has been provided by the MAH:  
Primary melanoma tumor characteristics are considered to be comparable between adolescent and 
adult melanoma patients, in contrast to the disease in prepubescent children. In an analysis of 
1255 pediatric and young adults (age less than 20 years), the 10 to 19 year-old group had similar 
baseline characteristics compared with the group of 20 to 24 year-old young adults, while there were 
significant differences in baseline characteristics of young children (age less than 10 years) as 
compared with adolescents and young adults. Young children were more likely to be non-white and to 
have metastases, nodular or other histology, head, face, or neck primaries, thicker lesions, and history 
of cancer.3 
Similarity of melanoma disease between adolescents and adults has been demonstrated by a 
comparable biology.3 
Histology: The frequency of histological subtypes, such as lentigo malignant melanoma, superficial 
spreading melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and nodular melanoma in tumors of adolescent 
melanoma patients is comparable to melanoma tumors in adult patients. 
Clinical presentation: Primary tumor characteristics, such as the site of the primary tumor, stage at 
diagnosis, tumor thickness, or level of invasion were compared between pediatric and adult melanoma 
patients. The group of prepubescent patients appears to be in this context as a separate group with 
thicker tumor lesions, whereas primary tumor characteristics between adolescent and adult melanoma 
patients are comparable.3 Stage II and III melanoma in adults and adolescents can be considered as 
the same disease, sharing the same prognostic factors and the high risk of recurrence and death.37 
Risk factors: Common risk factors for melanoma in pediatric and adult patients are intermittent intense 
sun exposure, tendency to sunburn, tendency to freckle, fair skin, blue or green eyes, and blond or red 
hair. Genetic predisposing conditions for developing melanoma, specifically in the pediatric population, 
do more frequently manifest in early childhood than in adolescence.

Driver mutations: Among the pediatric melanomas, conventional melanoma, which predominantly 
occurs in adolescents, shares properties similar to adult melanomas, including mutation rates, high 
rate of single nucleotide variations that are characteristic of ultraviolet damage, and similar rate of 
activating BRAFV600 mutation, while the melanomas of childhood, especially in children < 10 years 
(melanomas arising in congenital melanocytic naevus and Spitzoid melanoma) share less genomic 
similarities with melanoma in adolescents and adults.38,39 
Similarity of melanoma disease between adolescents and adults has also been demonstrated by 
comparable outcomes: 
•  Survival: The OS in pediatric and adolescent melanoma is similar to what is seen in 
adults.3,10,40,41,42 
•  Response to intervention: Clinical studies in pediatric and adolescent melanoma patients as 
reported in the literature were analyzed to assess the response to intervention. Although the 
number of patients in these studies was small and the studies did not have a randomized 
design, treatment effects such as objective response or pharmacodynamic effects of 
immunotherapy appeared to be comparable to adult patients.10,7,8,9  
−  The few clinical studies with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in paediatric patients with 
melanoma showed a comparable safety profile to adult patients. Objective responses in 
individual patients were reported. However, the design of the reported studies and the small 
number of adolescent melanoma patients enrolled do not allow for a conclusive comparison of 
efficacy to adult studies.43,44,45 
−  Clinical studies with IFNα2b and high-dose IL-2 in paediatric patients showed the feasibility and 
overall comparable safety profile to adult patients. Pharmacodynamic effects of 
immunotherapy in children were reported to be comparable to adult patients.46,47,48,49,50 
−  The safety and effectiveness of the checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab as a single agent have been 
established in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older for the treatment of 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma.51

2.1.2.  About the product 
Ipilimumab (Yervoy; BMS-734016, MDX-010, MDX-CTLA4) is a human CTLA-4-blocking antibody. 
Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the 
activation and proliferation of tumour-infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signalling can 
also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T-cell 
responsiveness, including the antitumor response.  
Ipilimumab as monotherapy is approved in the US, EU, Japan, and several other countries as 
monotherapy and in combination with other agents for multiple tumour types. 
Nivolumab (Opdivo; BMS-936558, MDX-1106, ONO-4538) is a human monoclonal antibody that 
targets the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nivolumab and 
ipilimumab are both immune checkpoint inhibitors. Importantly, the recruitment of novel T cells to the 
tumour and the generation of memory T cells through CTLA-4 inhibition is independent of whether the 
tumour is expressing PD-L1 as a defence mechanism. Therefore, the combination of ipilimumab and 
nivolumab can potentially further reduce the tumour cells’ escape mechanism against the host’s anti-
tumour T cell response. Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab has demonstrated efficacy (which 
includes prolonged duration of response, among other efficacy outcomes) in various tumour types in 
multiple approved indications. 
Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab has been approved in the US, EU, Japan, and several other 
countries for multiple tumour types, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, 
malignant pleural mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, oesophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.  
In the EU, the approved dosing regimen for ipilimumab as monotherapy for adults and adolescents 12 
years and older with advanced melanoma is 3 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses. The approved dosing regimen 
for ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab for adults with advanced melanoma is ipilimumab 3 
mg/kg Q3W + nivolumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical studies supporting the proposed melanoma indication and included in this application are 
summarized in section 4.3.1 below. The MAH did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP concerning the 
current procedure. A presubmission meeting with the Rapporteurs was held on 7th July 2022. During 
the meeting an outline of the intended submission was presented. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
See section 2.3.1. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ipilimumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), it is exempt from the submission of 
Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Ipilimumab in monotherapy was previously authorized in melanoma in children and adolescents 12 
years of age and older. An intravenous study of pre- and postnatal development in cynomolgus 
monkeys with a 6-month postnatal evaluation was requested for monotherapy authorization. The non-
clinical study report was previously submitted within procedure EMEA/H/C/002213/II/0002.  
For combination therapy with nivolumab, no new non-clinical data have been submitted, which was 
considered acceptable. 
Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody and is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment, 
thus the lack of ERA studies is acceptable.

PPK Analysis of Ipilimumab for Adolescent Advanced Melanoma 
The objectives of the PPK analysis for ipilimumab relevant to adolescent advanced melanoma were as 
follows: 
• 
• 
To characterize the PK of ipilimumab in paediatric subjects who received combination 
treatment with nivolumab, including the effect of covariates on PK parameters. 
To provide recommendations of a nivolumab monotherapy dosing regimen and a nivolumab - 
ipilimumab combination dosing regimen for adolescent patients (from 12 to <18 years) with 
advanced melanoma, using model-based simulations. 
The ipilimumab PPK analysis for advanced melanoma includes data from 10 studies (among which 4 
studies with nivo + ipi combination therapy [CA209067, CA209069, CA209070, CA209908]). Studies 
CA209070 (nivo+ipi combo), CA209908 (nivo+ipi combo), CA184070 (ipi mono), and CA184178 (ipi 
mono) included paediatric patients treated with ipilimumab. 
A total of 1427 subjects were included in the ipilimumab PPK analysis dataset, including 1289 adult 
subjects and 138 paediatric subjects. The 1289 adult subjects included 1261 subjects with advanced

melanoma, 6 subjects with CNS tumours, and 22 subjects with other tumours. The 138 paediatric 
subjects included 23 subjects with advanced melanoma, 72 subjects with CNS tumours, and 43 
subjects with other tumours.

Model Development 
PK of ipilimumab in paediatric subjects with (melanoma) MEL has been characterized previously. The 
previously developed final model included body weight, LDH and age as covariates on CL, and body 
weight as a covariate on VC. It focused on ipilimumab monotherapy and subjects with MEL, it was used 
to support ipilimumab paediatric dosing recommendation in subjects with MEL and thereafter  selected 
as the base model (removing age and LDH effect on CL) for further model development. 
The ipilimumab PPK model was developed in 2 stages, as shown below: 
1) Base Model: Re-estimate the parameters of a previously determined final model, including 
covariates retained in the previous base model. 
2) Full Model: Key known effects of covariates on ipilimumab PK were included in the base model. The 
focus of the full model was to assess the effect of additional covariates (namely, patient population and 
combination therapy on ipilimumab CL). 
Base Model 
The previous developed final PPK model was a 2-compartment, zero-order IV infusion with stationary 
clearance. A proportional residual error model was used, and the random effects include log-normally 
distributed random effects on CL, VC, and VP, and a correlation between the CL and VC random 
effects. The base model included covariate effects of baseline body weight on CL and VC. The baseline 
LDH was not included as a covariate because missing values exceeded 10%. The residual error model 
was a combined proportional and additive residual error model.

EMA/221125/2023  
Page 28/129 
 
 
 
 
Table 7 Parameter Estimates of the Base PPK Model 
The parameter estimates for this model are presented in Table 7. All parameters were estimated with 
good precision (relative standard error [RSE%] < 20%) and were consistent with previously estimated 
values from the final model in paediatric subjects with melanoma. 
Full Model 
The full model was developed from the base model, by incorporating additional covariates in the PK 
parameters, including assessment of age, combination therapy, and patient population (adult MEL as 
reference) on baseline CL. 
Lean body mass was investigated as body size parameters and it provided better fitting than baseline

Adult CNS tumours, paediatric melanoma (Paediatric MEL), and paediatric CNS tumours (Paediatric 
CNST) (< 18 years). The categorical effect of age (adolescent ≥ 12 years to < 18 years, paediatric < 
12 years) on VC were included in the full model.

Assessment of Uncertainty in Paediatric PK Model Parameters 
The uncertainty of PK model parameters was assessed. The 95% CI of the CL and VC for a typical 
paediatric MEL, CNST and Other tumour subject at 17, 12, 8 or 4 years old were all contained within 
60% to 140% of typical value, except for CL for paediatric CNST (the upper bound for 95% CI was 
142%).

Comparison of PK Parameters Among Patient Populations 
Ipilimumab empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) PK parameters including CL and VC were obtained from 
the full model for each subject. The relationship between ipilimumab PK parameters and patient 
populations were presented.

Simulation of Paediatric Exposures 
Ipilimumab exposures were simulated using stochastic simulations for adolescents with melanoma (≥ 
12 to < 18 years) with selected doses of ipilimumab alone or in combination with nivolumab to identify 
doses that produce similar ipilimumab exposures to the adult MEL population with following approved 
dosing regimens. 
Stochastic simulations were performed using an adolescent population created by random sampling 
from the NHANES database (2017-2018). The created adolescent population includes 800 subjects of 
ages 12 to < 18 years with body weight, lean body mass (estimated from height, weight, age and 
gender), sex, and race information.

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was evaluated from the detection of nivolumab and ipilimumab Anti-Drug Antibody 
(ADA)and characterization of neutralising antibody (Nab). A subject’s immunogenicity status was 
assessed using the follow criteria to determine the incidence of ADA development: 
Baseline ADA Positive: A subject with baseline ADA-positive sample 
ADA Positive: A subject with at least one ADA-positive sample relative to baseline (ADA negative at 
baseline or ADA titer to be at least 4-fold or greater (≥) than baseline positive titer) at any time after 
initiation of treatment. 
Persistent Positive (PP): ADA-positive sample at 2 or more consecutive time points, where the first and 
last ADA-positive samples are at least 16 weeks apart.

2.3.3.   PK/PD modelling 
The purpose of the Exposure-Response (E-R) analysis described in this report is to evaluate the 
potential impact of higher nivolumab exposures in adolescents with melanoma on safety when using 
the approved adult dosing regimens. 
The E-R relationship for safety was characterized with respect to Grade 2+ immune mediated adverse 
event (Gr2+ IMAEs). The E-R relationship was characterized with data from nivolumab monotherapy, 
ipilimumab monotherapy, and nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy studies in adult, young 
paediatric (< 12 years) and adolescent (≥ 12 to < 18 years) subjects across solid tumours, including 
advanced melanoma and melanoma in the adjuvant setting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 44/129 
 
 
 
 
 
The endpoint of time to Gr2+ IMAEs was selected to reflect AEs that are specific to cancer 
immunotherapy due to the increased activity of the immune system from the treatment. 
Based on previous analyses, the endpoint of time to Gr2+ IMAEs was more sensitive to exposure 
changes and informed on more proximal mechanistic, immunomodulatory effects on safety, compared 
with Gr3+ AEs and Gr2+ TRAEs. Therefore, the Gr2+ IMAE endpoint was selected to characterize the 
combined paediatric and adult E-R of safety and to predict the impact on adolescent safety for different 
adolescent dosing regimens. 
Time-varying daily Cavg (referred to hereafter as daily Cavg) of nivolumab and ipilimumab derived 
from the PPK analysis, was used as the measure of exposure. 
The E-R safety analysis was performed with data from 3507 subjects with advanced or adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma from 15 studies who were treated with nivolumab, ipilimumab, or nivolumab + 
ipilimumab. There were 42 young paediatric subjects (< 12 years) and 55 adolescent (≥ 12 to < 18 
years) subjects included in the dataset. 
The analysis population included data from all subjects for whom nivolumab and/or ipilimumab 
exposure measures determined by the PPK analysis were available. All adult and paediatric subjects 
who received ipilimumab 10 mg/kg Q3W in the advanced melanoma setting were excluded to focus on 
regimens relevant to the approved adult advanced melanoma regimens. 
Adult subjects who received nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (N3I1) Q3W for 4 doses from 
Study CA209511 were also excluded due to the biased predictions for this adult dosing regimen during 
the initial model development. Exclusion of these regimens did not impact the ability to predict 
Gr2+IMAEs for the adolescent dosing regimens being considered in advanced and adjuvant treatment 
of melanoma. 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab exposure measures for advanced melanoma in adults and adolescents were 
simulated using the EBEs of individual PK parameters based on a previous PPK analysis that 
characterized the PK of nivolumab monotherapy and combination with ipilimumab in adolescent 
subjects with advanced metastatic melanoma. 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab exposure measures for Study CA209511 were obtained from a previous PPK 
analysis. Ipilimumab exposures measures for advanced melanoma from Study CA184169 were 
obtained from a previous PPK analysis.

The following variables were included in the safety E-R analysis dataset: 
• 
Exposure variables: daily Cavg 
•  Response variables: time to first occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs 
•  Baseline demographic variables: age, sex, and race 
•  Baseline clinical laboratory variables: baseline LDH 
•  Baseline disease characteristics: PD-L1 expression, PS, tumour setting, line of therapy, and 
treatment 
•  Other: WTB 
IMAEs are specific events (or groups of MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) describing specific events) that 
include diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction, rash, 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, and endocrine disorders (adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus). 
The ipilimumab studies reported immune mediated adverse events (IRAEs,) which are closely related 
to IMAEs. IRAEs were defined using a predefined list of MedDRA high level group terms, high-level 
terms, and PTs. Six subcategories of IRAEs were reported: gastrointestinal, liver, skin, endocrine, 
neurological, and other. 
Model development 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 46/129 
 
 
 
 
The relationship between nivolumab and/or ipilimumab exposure (daily Cavg) and time to first 
occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs was characterized by a semi-parametric stratified Cox Proportional-Hazards 
(CPH) model. 
A treatment, stratified CPH model was evaluated using nivolumab monotherapy, ipilimumab 
monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab combination and compared to an unstratified model. The 
treatment stratified model was suggested by the differences in the observed cumulative probability 
curves across these treatments (Figure 3.2.1.2-1) and the fact that all ipilimumab monotherapy 
studies may have a different baseline hazard given the use of a slightly different definition for immune 
mediated adverse events (IRAEs) as compared to the other treatments that used IMAE definitions.

Melanoma 
The VPCs for the treatment stratified, full CPH model selected above indicated that the developed 
model was not able to characterize all the treatment groups included in the analysis dataset well (data 
not shown). Particularly, the model underpredicted the Gr2+ IMAEs in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg 
treatment group and overpredicted Gr2+ IMAEs in the adult combination dosing regimen of N3I1 when

comparing to the observed data. Given the broad dose range in the pooled dataset and that the E-R 
relationship may not be the same across the groups, it was a challenge to develop a model that could 
characterize all the treatment groups. Therefore, the model was re-developed using a simplified 
dataset to focus on providing an adequate fit to the treatments of interest and providing adolescent 
predictions. Specifically, all adult and paediatric subjects that received ipilimumab 10 mg/kg Q3W and 
adult subjects that received N3I1 in Study CA209511 were excluded from model development. 
Paediatric subjects that received ipilimumab up to 5 mg/kg and paediatric subjects receiving the N3I1 
regimen remained in the dataset. 
The parameter estimates of the full E-R Gr2+ IMAEs model are presented in Table 17. 
Table 17 Parameter Estimates of the Exposure-Response of Gr2+ IMAEs (Full Model) 
The 95% CI for the estimated magnitude of effect of ipilimumab exposure on the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs 
did not include the null value, indicating it was statistically significant with a hazard increase per unit 
increase in exposure (HR 1.008 [95% CI 1.001, 1.014]) for ipilimumab after accounting for the 
potential effect of the other covariates as shown in Table 5.1.1-1. This indicated that higher ipilimumab 
exposure was associated with higher risk of Gr2+ IMAEs in contrast to nivolumab exposure, which had 
a model estimated coefficient that was slightly negative and not significant. The interaction between 
nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures in combination therapy was also statistically significant with a HR 
of 0.9995 (95% CI 0.9991, 0.9998). This represents the synergistic interaction of exposure and 
treatment effects in addition to the exposure effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab alone.

Model evaluation 
Model performance for the E-R safety model was assessed by VPC comparing the cumulative 
probability of Gr2 +IMAEs with the corresponding model-predicted 90% PI of Gr2+ IMAEs. 
The CPH model predictions were evaluated by comparing the model-predicted cumulative time to- 
event distributions of Gr2+ IMAEs with the corresponding distribution determined by nonparametric 
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis. Data used in the model development were used as an internal validation 
dataset for K-M analysis. 
VPCs of the cumulative probability of the first occurrence of a Gr2+ IMAE, stratified by adult, young 
paediatric (< 12 years), and adolescent (≥ 12 to < 18 years) subjects showed that the model-

predicted cumulative probabilities were generally in good agreement with the model predictions in the

The cumulative rate of the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs is higher in the combination therapy group compared to

Population PK modelling and model based simulation and exposure-safety analysis has been performed 
in order to recommend adolescent (from 12 to <18 years) dosing regimens for ipilimumab in 
combination with nivolumab for the treatment of advanced melanoma  
PPK Analysis of Ipilimumab for Adolescent Advanced Melanoma 
The ipilimumab population PK analysis for advanced melanoma was based on a pooled dataset from 10 
studies, which includes 4 Studies CA209067, CA209069, CA209070 and CA209908 with Nivolumab and

ipilimumab combination therapy. Studies CA209070, CA209908, CA184070 and CA184178 included 
paediatric patients treated with ipilimumab. The dataset includes 1289 adult subjects (1261 with 
advanced melanoma) and 138 paediatric subjects (23 with advanced melanoma) 
PK samples of ipilimumab below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) were low (2.57 %) and were 
excluded from the analysis. M1 method for handling BLQ-data (below limit of quantification) is 
considered acceptable.  
A previous ipilimumab population PK model in paediatric subjects with melanoma was developed to 
support the indication of ipilimumab as monotherapy in paediatric patients with melanoma (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002213/II/0044). 
The population PK model development of nivolumab included the re-estimation of the parameters of 
the previously developed PPK model including covariates (new base model). Subsequently, additional 
covariates were tested in the PK parameters, including patient population and combination therapy on 
ipilimumab CL.  In addition, body size parameters and age-related effects were tested on CL and VC. 
Ipilimumab PK was described using a 2-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion with stationary 
clearance. Overall, the modelling strategy is endorsed. 
Moderate inter-individual variability has been characterized in the PK parameters CL (39.79%) and VC 
(23.35%). The full popPK model included 11 covariate effects. Combination with nivolumab 1mg/kg 
and combination with nivolumab 3mg/kg on CL covariates are non-significant based on the 95% CI, 
which included the null value (and those covariate effects were unreliable estimated based on the high 
RSE (relative standard error) (values 54.9 and 57.3% respectively). Although the mechanistic rationale 
supporting a different impact of nivolumab combination due to dose level (1 and 3 mg/kg) on 
ipilimumab’s clearance is unclear, the evidence of an interaction effect for monoclonal antibodies was 
unexpected.  
A forest plot has been provided to assess the clinical relevance of the covariates selected based on the 
change on the main PK parameters (CL, VC). The impact of significant covariates on exposure metrics 
(Cmax4, Cavg4, Cmin4) was assessed using the full model by obtaining individual ipilimumab 
exposures for subjects for whom EBE of PK parameters were available. Distributions of each exposure 
metric were presented, showing no clinically relevant (<20%) differences in exposure across the 
covariate subgroups.   
Simulation of Paediatric exposures 
Ipilimumab exposures were simulated for adolescent with melanoma and adults with melanoma with 
the selected doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) in combination with nivolumab (1 mg/kg) Q3W for 4 
Doses. The combination results in higher exposures (Cavg, Cmin and Cmax) at 4th cycle of treatment 
in adolescent patients with body weight >60 kg compared to adults receiving the same regimen. 
Similar results were shown for the ipilimumab monotherapy treatment 3 mg/kg.  
On the other hand, when treatment was given as nivolumab 1 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 80 mg) in 
combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 240 mg) or ipilimumab monotherapy 3 
mg/kg (up to a maximum of 240 mg) Q3W for 4 Doses, the exposures were more comparable to adult 
exposures across different body weight sub-groups of adolescent patients. Overall, adolescent patients 
with <60 kg or >100 kg will show exposure metrics within the adult range. Between 10-38% of 
adolescent patients from 80 to 90 kg will show exposure levels higher than adults. Less than 15% of 
adolescent patients of 60-80 kg or 90-100kg will show exposure higher than the adult range with the 
proposed regimen.  
Immunogenicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 54/129 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity was assessed in Study CA209070. Three out of 51 (5.9%) patients treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy tested positive for ADA at baseline and only one of them tested positive post 
baseline and was not persistent positive.  For the pool data of both combination treatment, 2 out of 35 
(5.7%) tested positive at baseline for nivolumab ADA but it was not persistent positive and 1 out of 33 
tested positive for ipilimumab (3.2%). Similar immunogenicity was observed in the different groups. 
The impact of immunogenicity after the combination treatment showed no relevant concerns. 
Exposure-response 
The MAH has justified the absence of an exposure-efficacy analysis in the target population. The 
limited paediatric melanoma patients in study CA209070 hampers the development of an exposure-
efficacy model in the target population.  
The exposure-safety analysis was performed with pool data from 15 studies which include data from 
nivolumab monotherapy, ipilimumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in 
adult, young paediatric and adolescent subjects in treatment of solid tumours including treatment of 
advanced melanoma and adjuvant treatment of melanoma. Forty-two young paediatric subjects (< 12 
years) and 55 adolescent (≥ 12 to < 18 years) were included. 
Occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs was used as safety outcome in the exposure safety analysis as this 
endpoint is more sensitive to change in exposure and is more related to nivolumab/ipilimumab 
immunomodulatory activity than Gr3+ AEs and Gr2+ TRAEs. The relationship between nivolumab 
and/or ipilimumab exposure (daily Cavg) and time to first occurrence of Gr2+ IMAEs was characterized 
by a semi-parametric stratified Cox Proportional-Hazards (CPH) model, which included the Cavg of 
ipilimumab. No statistically significant relationship was found for Cavg of nivolumab. Several additional 
covariates were included in the model, such as race, body weight, tumour type, sex, age, PD-L1 and 
line of treatment. Model evaluation suggests that a similar trend in the probability of Gr2+ IMAE in 
adolescents and adults was observed, although the curve for adolescents was terminated due to 
clinical trial design. For young paediatrics, the probability of Gr2+ IMAE seems to increase faster 
compared to adolescent or adults and the model clearly underpredicts the overall trend. This issue 
shows the lack of the CPH model to characterize the time-course of Gr2+ IMAE in young paediatric 
patients (<12 y), which would require to be further updated in case a dose justification is aimed in this 
subgroup of patients. Of note, only adolescents are the target of the proposed extension of the 
indication. 
Simulations of different dose regimens were performed in order to evaluate the impact on the 
probability of Gr2+ IMAE in adolescent patients compared to adults. The rationale provided by the 
Applicant regarding the lower predicted probability of developing Grade 2+ IMAE in adolescent vs adult 
patients is based on the larger contribution of age and body weight effects on the safety outcomes 
rather than the higher exposure expected in adolescent patients at the proposed dosing regimen. This 
put in questions the similarity of the safety profile between both populations, since there is a tendency 
for greater toxicity with greater age and body weight. The selection of the dose should therefore not be 
based on the ability to reach an exposure similar to adults but requires characterizing the safety profile 
of ipilimumab in each sub-group of the paediatric population. In conclusion, the justification provided 
by the Applicant is supported by experimental evidence, but it is important to note that for additional 
paediatric population group, other than adolescents, an update of the model including additional data 
able to describe the plateau in the probability of safety events would be needed to fully characterize 
the CPH model before conducting any dose recommendation.   
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of ipilimumab in adolescent patients with advanced melanoma 
have been overall adequately characterized. The exposures of ipilimumab in combination with

Pivotal study CA209070 (ADVL1412) is a Phase 1/2 open-label trial of nivolumab in children, 
adolescents, and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumours as a single agent and in 
combination with ipilimumab. This is an investigator sponsored research (ISR) study, designed, and 
conducted by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and funded by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). This 
COG clinical study is included as one of the agreed measures in both approved Paediatric Investigation 
Plans (PIP) for nivolumab (procedures ref. EMEA-001407-PIP01-12-M03 and EMEA-001407-PIP02-15-
M05) and other agreed to global paediatric plans. 
The primary objectives of Study CA209070 are to determine safety and tolerability, antitumor effects, 
PK, and immunogenicity of nivolumab and nivo+ipi combination therapy. 
ADVL1412 evaluated the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Part A: was a dose confirmation to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
nivolumab monotherapy in children and adolescents. The single-agent RP2D was determined to 
be nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. 
Part B: was done to test the RP2D determined in part A, identify signals of activity, and 
generate further information regarding toxicity of the drug in the following disease specific 
cohorts: rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma/ peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour 
(PNET), osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL), and melanoma. 
Part C: was a dose confirmation to establish nivolumab and ipilimumab combination RP2D in 
children and adolescents. The RP2D of ipi+nivo was determined to be nivolumab 3 mg/kg in 
combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W. 
Part D: was performed to allow select disease cohorts in Part B (neuroblastoma, RMS, NHL, 
osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma), which did not progress beyond the initial stage due to lack 
of objective responses to nivolumab monotherapy, to be further evaluated with a combination 
of nivolumab and ipilimumab using Part C RP2D.  
Part E: was done to evaluate alternative dosing of nivolumab and ipilimumab (nivolumab 1 
mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg) compared to combination dosing achieved in Part C R2PD in 
rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET, the 2 tumour types where a response

had been observed in Part D. A safety monitoring rule was stated for Part E: if, at least, one 
Cycle 1 DLT occurred among the first 10 subjects or 4 subjects with DLT among 20, then the 
study was to be closed and concluded that Part E dose was too toxic. 
The study was initially planned with 3 parts (Part A, Part B, and Part C), and per Amendments 4 and 
8B, Parts D and E were added later, respectively.

6.  Prior Therapy 
Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior anti-cancer therapy and 
must meet different minimum duration from prior anti-cancer directed therapy prior to enrolment 
(details can be found in the protocol). If after the required timeframe, the defined eligibility criteria 
are met, e.g. blood count criteria, the patient is considered to have recovered adequately. 
7.  Organ Function Requirements 
•  Adequate bone marrow function defined as: 
o  For patients with solid tumours without known bone marrow involvement: 
 
 
Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750/mm3. 
Platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving 
platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrolment). 
o  Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for study provided 
they meet the established blood counts. These patients will not be evaluable for 
hematologic toxicity. At least 5 of every cohort of 6 patients with a solid tumour must 
be evaluable for hematologic toxicity, for Parts A and C. If dose-limiting hematologic 
toxicity is observed on either Part A or C, all subsequent patients enrolled must be 
evaluable for hematologic toxicity on that Part. 
•  Adequate renal function defined as: 
o  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ≥70 ml/min/1.73 m2 or 
o  A serum creatinine based on age/gender 
•  Adequate liver function defined as: 
o  Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for 
age  
o  SGPT (ALT) ≤135 U/L. For the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L. 
•  Adequate pulmonary function: no evidence of dyspnoea at rest, no exercise intolerance due to 
pulmonary insufficiency, and a pulse oximetry >92% while breathing room air. 
•  Adequate pancreatic function defined as: Serum lipase ≤ULN at baseline.  
Key exclusion criteria 
1.  Pregnant or breast-feeding women were not to be entered on this study due to risks of foetal and 
teratogenic adverse events as there was yet no available information regarding human foetal or 
teratogenic toxicities. Pregnancy tests were to be obtained in girls who were post-menarchal. 
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab were to be instructed to adhere to 
contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab 
and who were sexually active with WOCBP were to be instructed to adhere to contraception for a 
period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab.

2.  Concomitant Medications  
•  Corticosteroids: Patients requiring daily systemic corticosteroids were not eligible. Patients 
must not have received systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to enrolment. If used to 
modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, ≥14 days must have elapsed since 
last dose of corticosteroid. Note: Use of topical or inhaled corticosteroids did not render a 
patient ineligible.  
• 
Investigational Drugs: Patients who were currently receiving another investigational drug were 
not eligible.  
•  Anti-cancer Agents: Patients who were currently receiving other anti-cancer agents were not 
eligible. 
3.  Patients with CNS tumours or known CNS metastases were excluded from this trial due to concerns 
regarding pseudo-progression in the CNS. Patients with a history of CNS metastases that were 
previously treated may have enrolled if sequential imaging showed no evidence for active disease. 
Patients with extra axial disease [e.g. skull (bone) metastasis that did not invade the dura] may 
have enrolled if there was no evidence for CNS oedema associated with the lesion.  
4.  Patients who had received prior anti-PD1 directed therapy (monoclonal antibody [mAb] or small 
molecule) were not eligible.  
5.  Parts C and D: Patients who had received prior ipilimumab were not eligible.

No dose modifications were allowed for dose-limiting hematological toxicity (dose escalation or de-
escalation to be guided by toxicity in Part A and C, respectively). For any dose-limiting non-
hematological toxicity, dose modifications were allowed.  
The study was designed to determine the safety and tolerability, assess antitumor effects, to 
determine whether the systemic nivolumab exposure in children was similar to the systemic exposure 
in adults and evaluate the PK of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab.  
To determine RP2D for nivolumab monotherapy in children (Part A), a starting dose of nivolumab 
3 mg/kg IV Q2W (hereafter referred to as nivolumab monotherapy) was infused and de-escalation to 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV Q2W was planned if the dose level was not tolerated. For the nivo + ipi 
combination, a starting dose of nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (hereafter referred to 
as nivo 1 + ipi 1) was planned, and if <2 DLTs in a cohort of 6 patients were observed, the dose was 
escalated to nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W (hereafter referred as nivo 3 + ipi 1). 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
•  Determine the tolerability and define and describe the toxicities of nivolumab administered as a 
single agent in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumours at the adult recommended dose 
of 3 mg/kg.  
•  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D and define and describe the toxicities 
of nivolumab plus ipilimumab administered to children with relapsed or refractory solid tumours.  
•  Assess antitumor effects of nivolumab across selected childhood solid tumours in seven expansion 
cohorts (Parts B1-B6, B8); neuroblastoma (2 cohorts: measurable disease; 
metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG] positive only non-measurable disease), osteosarcoma, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, HL, and NHL. A non-statistical access cohort (without

in children with R/R solid 
tumours at the adult 
recommended dose of 3 mg/kg. 
Determine the MTD and/or

Assess antitumor effects of 
nivolumab across selected 
childhood solid tumours in 7 
expansion cohorts (Parts B1-B6, 
B8); neuroblastoma (2 cohorts: 
measurable disease; MIBG 
positive only non-measurable 
disease), osteosarcoma, RMS, 
Ewing sarcoma, HL, and NHL. 
A non-statistical access cohort 
for the rare diagnosis of 
melanoma (Part B7) remained 
open to enrolment until Parts 
B1-B6, B8 are complete B7 to 
preliminarily define the 
antitumor effects of nivolumab 
within the confines of a Phase 
1/2 study. 
Assess antitumor effects of 
nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab across 
selected childhood solid 
tumours in two dose 
combinations (Part D). 
Characterize the PK of 
nivolumab alone and in 
combination with ipilimumab, 
including AUC, Cmax, Cmin, 
using intensive sampling.a  
PK 
RP2D or MTD was assessed based on DLT. The number of 
subjects with DLTs were tabulated once specifically for DLT 
assessment for Parts A and C (separately). The DLT evaluation 
period consisted of the first dose of study drug through the first 28 
days for Part A and 21 days for Part C of treatment. DLT 
definitions were provided in protocol section 5.4. 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the number of 
responders divided by the sum of the number of responders and 
non-responders, multiplied by 100.  Eligible patients who received 
at least 1 dose of protocol therapy were considered evaluable for 
response. Evaluable patients who demonstrated a CR or PR 
confirmed by central review before receiving non-protocol 
anticancer therapy were considered a responder. All other 
evaluable patients were considered non-responders. Each patient 
was classified according to their “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect. 
Time to Response (TTR) was defined as the time from the date of 
first dose of study medication to the first response date (CR or PR, 
whichever occurred first), as assessed by the investigator and 
confirmed by Central Review. TTR was evaluated for responders 
only. Note that when confirmation was required, it was the time 
from the first study dose date to the date the response was first 
observed (the initial response date). 
Duration of Response (DOR) was defined as the time between 
the first response date (CR or PR whichever is recorded first), as 
determined by the investigator and confirmed by Central Review, 
to the date of the first documented tumour progression or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who died 
without a reported prior progression were considered to have 
progressed on the date of their death. For subjects who neither 
progressed nor died, DOR was censored on the date of their last 
evaluable tumour assessment. DOR was evaluated for responders 
only. When confirmation of response was required, the first date 
when initial response was observed was used.  
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of first 
dose of study medication to the date of death from any cause. For 
subjects that were alive, their survival time was censored at the date 
of last contact date (or “last known alive date”).  
The following PK parameters of nivolumab alone and in 
combinations with ipilimumab was derived: 
Cmax: Maximum observed serum concentration 
Tmax: Time of maximum observed serum concentration 
Ctau: Serum concentration achieved at the end of dosing interval 
Cmin: Predose trough serum concentration 
AUC(TAU): AUC in one dosing interval 
AUC(0-T): AUC from time zero to the last time of the last 
quantifiable concentration

PD-L1 status 
Endpoint Description 
Immunogenicity interpretation was evaluated from the detection 
of nivolumab and ipilimumab ADA and characterization of 
neutralizing antibodies. A subject’s immunogenicity status was 
assessed using the follow criteria to determine the incidence of 
ADA development:  
Baseline ADA Positive: A subject with baseline ADA-positive 
sample; ADA Positive: A subject with at least one ADA-positive 
sample relative to baseline (ADA negative at baseline or ADA 
titer to be at least 4-fold or greater (≥) than baseline positive titer) 
at any time after initiation of treatment; Persistent Positive (PP): 
ADA-positive sample at 2 or more consecutive timepoints, where 
the first and last ADA-positive samples are at least 16 weeks 
apart; Not PP-Last Sample Positive: Not persistent but with 
ADA-positive sample at the last sampling timepoint; Other 
Positive: Not persistent but some ADA-positive samples with the 
last sample being negative; Neutralizing Positive: At least one 
ADA-positive sample with neutralizing antibodies detected post-
baseline; ADA Negative: A subject with no ADA-positive sample 
after initiation of treatment. 
Exploratory analysis on effects of nivolumab (alone and in 
combination with ipilimumab) on changes in antibodies to 
previously vaccinated viruses were performed. Serum samples for 
these analyses were collected in accordance with Protocol 
Appendix IV (at baseline and prior to Cycle 2, Day 1 nivolumab 
infusion). Antibody titers for mumps, measles, rubella, and 
varicella was considered for this analysis. 
PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumour cell 
membrane staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumour cells 
per validated Dako PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay. This was 
referred to as quantifiable PD-L1 expression. If the PD-L1 
staining could not be quantified, it is further classified as: 
Indeterminate: Tumor cell membrane staining hampered for 
reasons attributed to the biology of the tumour tissue sample and 
not because of improper sample preparation or handling. 
Not evaluable: Tumor tissue sample was not optimally collected 
or prepared and PD-L1 expression was neither quantifiable nor 
indeterminate. Not evaluable could be determined from H&E 
process before the tumour biopsy specimen was sent for PD-L1 
evaluation or from the H&E process during PD-L1 evaluation. 
Subjects with missing PD-L1 expression were subjects with no 
tumour tissue sample available for evaluation. 
a  All available PK concentration data from Parts A, B, C, and D were reported. PK parameters (Cmax, AUC, Cmin) were only 
reported for nivolumab for subjects in Parts A and B when intensive PK samples were collected with evaluable concentrations. 
Cmax and AUC were not reported for nivolumab or ipilimumab when administered in combination as intensive PK samples were 
not collected in Parts C and D, only Cmin was reported.

Sample size 
Overall, a maximum of 375 subjects were planned to be treated (Table 4). Simon’s optimal two-stage 
design was used for expansion Parts B1-B6, B8, D, and E. Assuming that the study did not stop early 
for occurrence of a DLT, a total of 10 response-evaluable subjects was be enrolled into stage 1. If at

least 1 response was observed among 10 evaluable subjects, then stage 2 was to be opened for 
enrolment of 10 additional subjects.

Determination of Recommended Phase 2 Dose for Nivolumab as a Single Agent 
The primary objective of Part A was the determination of MTD/RP2D of single-agent nivolumab (Part 
A). A minimum of 4 subjects (2 by dose level) were to be enrolled in Part A, with a maximum possible 
enrolment of 36 subjects. A maximum of 36 subjects could occur in the unlikely scenario if each dose 
level is expanded to 12 subjects, and if a 20% unevaluable rate occurs.  
Part A evaluated a single dose level (3 mg/kg). If 1 or fewer of 6 evaluable patients experienced DLT 
and at least 5/6 of patients achieved a Cmin of at least 10 mcg/ml, the 3 mg/kg dose level was 
considered to be the RP2D. If < 5 of 6 patients achieved a Cmin of at least 10 mcg/ml, a protocol 
amendment could be considered to test a higher dose level in Part A. Cmin levels > 30 mcg/ml could 
not, in and of itself result in a change in protocol design, unless excess toxicity was observed.  
If 2 or more of the 6 patients experienced DLT at the 3 mg/kg dose level, then the MTD was exceeded 
and the 1 mg/kg dose level was to be evaluated. If 1 or fewer of 6 patients experienced DLT at the 1 
mg/kg dose level and at least 5/6 of patients achieved a Cmin of at least 10 mcg/ml, then this dose 
level was to be the RP2D. Once the RP2D for nivolumab as a single agent was determined, Part B and 
Part C could open simultaneously. 
Phase 2 Evaluation of Nivolumab as a Single Agent at RP2D 
The primary objective of Part B was to identify histologic subtypes where there is a signal for anti-
tumour activity, using a Simon’s optimal two-stage design, with the exception of Part B7, which was a 
non-statistical access cohort for the rare diagnosis of melanoma. A minimum of 10 and maximum of 22 
evaluable subjects per disease group were to be enrolled in Parts B1-B6 and B8. The following Simon’s 
optimal two stage design was used for Parts B1-B6, B8 (Table 5). The best response of disease to 
nivolumab was examined separately for each of the tumour strata.

In the event that a cohort in a given disease group in Part B was completed after Stage 1 because no 
responses were observed, a cohort in the same disease group could open to up to 10 evaluable 
patients in Part D, at the RP2D of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab as determined in Part C. 
Nivolumab was not considered of sufficient interest for further evaluation in a disease category if the 
true response rate was 5% and of sufficient activity if the true response rate was 25%. If nivolumab 
had a true response rate of 5%, the rule described above could identify it of sufficient activity for 
further study with probability 0.07 (type I error), and the trial would have an expected sample size of 
14 with 60% probability of early termination. If nivolumab had a true response rate of 25%, the rule 
described above would identify it of sufficient activity for further study with probability 0.88 (power 
against the alternative hypothesis P = 0.25). 
If cycle 1 DLT occurs in ≥33% of evaluable patients in a cohort of Part B with at least 3 evaluable 
patients, the maximum tolerated dose would have been exceeded in this tumour type and the cohort 
was to be closed to further enrolment. 
Given the activity seen in adult patients with melanoma, an additional non-statistical cohort for 
patients with unresectable, metastatic, relapsed, or refractory melanoma was opened to accrual as 
Part B7 to preliminarily define the antitumor effects of nivolumab within the confines of a phase 1/2 
study. Part B7 could remain open to enrolment until Parts B1-B6, B8 and Parts D1-D6 were completed. 
If at any time after enrolment of 3 subjects, cycle 1 DLT occurs in ≥33% in the melanoma cohort (Part 
B7), enrolment to that cohort was to be closed. A minimum of 0 evaluable subjects and a maximum of 
16 subjects were anticipated to enroll in this disease group assuming the maximum study duration of 4 
years. 
Dose Escalation and Determination of Recommended Phase 2 Dose for Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab 
(Part C) 
The primary objective of Part C was determination of MTD/Recommended RP2D of the combination 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab. A minimum of 2 patients were to be enrolled in Part C, with a maximum 
possible enrolment of 36 subjects similar to Part A. 
A rolling six phase 1 trial design was used for the conduct of Part C of this study. Two to 6 patients 
could be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of patients enrolled 
at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who had experienced DLT at the current dose 
level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability data pending at the current dose 
level. Accrual was to be suspended when a cohort of six had enrolled or when the study endpoints 
were met. 
Phase 2 Evaluation of Nivolumab (3 mg/kg) in Combination with Ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) (Part D) 
The primary objective of Part D was to evaluate the dose of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 
determined in Part C in selected disease cohorts (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma) using the same Simon’s optimal two-stage design as in 
Part B only if there was insufficient activity in the initial stage of the Simon’s optimal two-stage design 
in Part B. A minimum of 10 and maximum of 22 evaluable subjects per disease group were to be 
enrolled in Parts D1-D6. Note that per amendment 4, no subjects were enrolled in D1, D5, and D6 
Cohorts. 
The best response of disease to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab was to be examined 
separately for each of the tumour strata. Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab was not 
considered of sufficient interest for further evaluation in a disease category if the true response rate 
was 5% and of sufficient activity if the true response rate was 25%. Design had the same operating 
characteristics as described for Part B. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 67/129 
 
 
 
If cycle 1 DLT occurred in ≥33% of evaluable patients in a cohort of Part D with at least 3 evaluable 
patients, the maximum tolerated dose would be exceeded in this tumour type and the cohort was to be 
closed to further enrolment. Up to 6 additional subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumours without 
restrictions on hematology evaluability could be enrolled at the RP2D determined in Part A and Part C 
to acquire PK data in a representative number of young subjects (min 6 subjects <12 years of age) at 
the MTD/RP2D in each Part. 
Randomisation 
This is not a randomized trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The SAP version 1.0 (dated 30-Apr-2021) has been provided. 
Unless otherwise noted, all analyses were performed on all treated subjects per treatment group and 
cohort (A, B1 to B8, C1, C2, D2 to D4) and also nivolumab monotherapy (A+B, pooled) and nivolumab 
combined with ipilimumab (C+D) overall, and split by solid tumours and hematologic malignancies (HL 
and NHL). Analysis by disease indication was also to be performed, pooling subjects with same disease 
diagnosis from Parts A and B (nivolumab mono), and from Parts C and D (nivolumab + ipilimumab 
combination). Indications consisted of HL, NHL, neuroblastoma, Ewing Sarcoma, osteosarcoma, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, and solid Tumour NOS (other tumour types not included in the 
previous solid tumour categories). Some analyses were also performed by age category. 
Efficacy endpoints 
Unless stated otherwise, analyses in this section were tabulated for all evaluable treated subjects and 
performed on the following groups: 
•  Nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab combined with ipilimumab 
•  Nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab combined with ipilimumab, per disease indication, 
total solid tumours and total hematologic malignancies. 
ORR 
Efficacy analyses based on tumour response were conducted using all response evaluable subject 
population. Tumour response was evaluated using RECIST except for subjects with neuroblastoma and 
MIBG only disease, Neuroblastoma and MIBG only disease were measured radiographically and other 
validated standard response criteria, respectively. 
Estimates of objective response rate are presented along with their two-sided 95% CI by Clopper and 
Pearson. 
OS 
Overall Survival analysis was conducted using subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy and using 
subjects treated with nivolumab+ipilimumab therapy, overall and by disease diagnosis. OS was 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) technique. The two-sided 95% CI for median OS was computed 
via the log-log transformation method. OS rates at fixed time points (e.g. 3 months, depending on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 68/129 
 
 
 
minimum follow-up) were presented along with their associated 95% CIs. These estimates were 
derived from the KM estimate and corresponding CIs were derived based on Greenwood formula for 
variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied on the survivor function.  
The status (on- vs off- study) of subjects who were censored in the OS KM analysis were tabulated. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 132 subjects were enrolled and 126 subjects (age from 1 to 27 years; 97 subjects <18 years 
old, including 53 subjects ≥12 to <18 years old) were treated with nivolumab monotherapy (N=80; 12 
subjects in Part A and 68 subjects in Part B) or ipi+nivo (N=46; 18 subjects in Part C and 28 subjects 
in Part D) in 23 sites in the US, and 1 site in Canada. Overall, the 97 (77.0%) subjects who were less 
than 18 years of age were treated with nivolumab monotherapy (N=64: 12 subjects in Part A and 52 
subjects in Part B), or ipi+nivo (N=33; 18 subjects in Part C and 15 subjects in Part D).

Recruitment 
The enrolment period was approximately 40 months (Mar-2015 to Jul-2018) for the nivo group and 
approximately 30 months (Aug-2015 to Feb-2018) for the nivo + ipi group. 
For Parts A and B, the FPFV occurred on 03-Apr-2015, and LPFV occurred on 31-Jul-2018, this data 
includes up to the clinical cut-off date of 30-Sep-2019, the minimum follow-up (time from LPFV date to 
data cut-off date) was >24.0 months for all cohorts except for Cohort B6, where 2 subjects had <24 
month of follow-up (1 subject died before the clinical data cut-off for Part A and B, and the other 
subject was off-study [withdrew consent], with a minimum follow-up of 16.1 and 14.0 months, 
respectively], which resulted in an overall minimum follow-up of 14.0 months for all subjects treated 
with nivo (N=80).

Similarly, for Parts C and D, the FPFV occurred on 13-Aug-2015, and LPFV occurred on 20-Feb-2018, 
this data includes up to the clinical cut-off date of 30-Jun-2020 providing 28.3 months of minimum 
follow-up time for all subjects treated with nivo + ipi (n=46). The median follow-up (time from clinical 
cut-off date to each subject first dosing date) for all subjects treated with nivo or nivo + ipi is 44.0 
months. 
As of 30-Jun-2020 data cut-off date, 8 subjects were enrolled in Part E of the study and data are 
reported in the Children’s Oncology Group progress report dated July 2020. 
Nivolumab monotherapy (Combined Cohorts of Parts A and B) 
At the time of the database lock (DBL), only one (1.3%) of the subjects treated with nivo in Cohort B5 
with HL was still on treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was clinical or 
radiographic evidence of progressive disease of >40% increase in target lesions (43.8%), physician 
determination of patients best interest (18.8%), and clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive 
disease greater than 12 weeks after start of protocol therapy (13.8%), see Table 29. 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab (Combined Cohorts of Parts C and D) 
At the time of the DBL, none of the subjects treated with nivo + ipi across cohorts were still on 
treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was clinical or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease of >40% increase in target lesions (65.2%) and clinical or 
radiographic evidence of progressive disease greater than 12 weeks after start of protocol therapy 
(17.4%), see Table 29.

Summary of Key Changes 
Not applicable. 
To clarify the correlative sample processing instructions with details 
provided by the drug company. Additionally, after discussions with Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and the drug company, the Endocrine 
and Autoimmune observations have been modified and the total required 
blood volumes have been significantly reduced. Administrative revisions 
have also been made for clarity and consistency throughout the protocol. 
To add guidelines for management of pleural effusion as well as to add an 
additional cohort to Part B for enrolment of patients with relapsed or 
refractory neuroblastoma who are evaluable only for meta-
iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) response. Administrative revisions have also 
been made for clarity and consistency throughout the protocol. Also, a non-
statistical cohort for melanoma patients was added. 
The protocol was revised in response to the updated request for rapid 
amendment (RRA) from Primary Investigator dated 01-Mar-2016. 
Additional administrative edits have been made for clarity within the 
protocol. 
To add Part D. Since response rates to combination nivolumab/ipilimumab 
are higher in melanoma than with single agent nivolumab, it is important to 
determine if the combination regimen might show efficacy in paediatric solid 
tumours. Hence, for select disease cohorts in Part B that do not meet criteria

Summary of Key Changes 
to proceed beyond Stage 1 due to lack of objective responses to single agent 
nivolumab, the combination of nivolumab (3 mg/kg) with ipilimumab (1 
mg/kg) was to be examined in selected disease specific cohorts. The 
combination of nivolumab (3 mg/kg) with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) was 
determined to be tolerable and is the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
the same schedule utilized in Part C. Additionally, the eligibility criteria have 
been modified to permit enrolment of patients with lymphoma who have 
previously received an allogeneic stem cell transplant. 
To reflect modified risk information for both nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
The comprehensive adverse events and potential risks (CAEPR) list for 
nivolumab has been updated to version 2.2, 15-Nov-2016.The CAEPR list 
for ipilimumab has been updated to version 2.8, 21-Dec-2016. 
Amendment in response to the Food and Drug Administration review of 
Amendment #4 to ADVL1412. In addition to changes made in response to 
the FDA, changes have also been made to address comments from Bristol-
Myers Squibb and CTEP recommendations. This included clarification of 
correlative study procedures involving vaccinated antibody responses. 
Stopping rules were added for the incidence of graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD) in lymphoma patients who enrolled following allogeneic stem cell 
transplant. Also, assessment of cardiac function, was added given the 
occurrence of myocarditis in patients using combination 
Ipilimumab/Nivolumab in other studies. 
Amendment in response to two RRAs from CTEP. The first was dated 17-
Jul-2018 for BMS-936558 (Nivolumab, MDX-1106, NSC 748726); the 
second was dated for 25-Jul-2018 for Ipilimumab (MDX010, NSCs 732442 
and 720801). In this amendment, the revised toxicity profile (BMS-936558, 
CAEPR version 2.3, dated 18-Jun-2018) has been inserted in the protocol, 
and the associated risk information in the informed consent document has 
been revised accordingly. The revised toxicity profile (Ipilimumab, CAEPR 
version 2.9, dated 20-Dec-2017) has been inserted in the protocol, and the 
associated risk information in the informed consent document has been 
revised accordingly. This amendment also reflected the conversion of the 
protocol to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) 
version 5.0. 
Amendment in response to a Request for Amendment from Primary 
Investigator, dated 20-Dec-2018 that includes administrative changes to 
reflect the transition from Children’s Oncology Group Chair (COGC) to 
Paediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN). This amendment 
also added a new arm (Part E) to explore a different combination of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing 
sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). 
Amendment in response to a RRA from Primary Investigator, dated 08-May-
2019. In this amendment the revised CAEPR for ipilimumab has been 
inserted in the protocol, and the associated risk information in the informed 
consent documents has been revised accordingly.

Outcomes and estimation 
The co-primary objectives for this study include antitumor effects of nivo monotherapy and nivo + ipi 
combination therapy efficacy assessments. The endpoints for efficacy assessments of antitumor effects 
include ORR, TTR, DOR, and OS. Other co-primary objectives include DLTs assessment, overall safety, 
pharmacokinetic, and immunogenicity assessments. 
Efficacy analyses were descriptive in nature. The minimum follow-up (time from LPFV date to data cut-
off date) was >24.0 months for all subjects treated with nivo mono in cohorts A and B except Cohort 
B6 (N =80). The minimum follow-up was 28.3 months for all subjects treated with nivo + ipi 
treatment). Efficacy results are summarized by tumour type for nivolumab monotherapy (pooled solid 
tumour and haematological tumour) and for nivo + ipi (solid tumour) in Table 38. 
For nivolumab monotherapy, no objective response was observed for the solid tumour cohorts (based 
on 58 response evaluable subjects including melanoma) (ORR 0% [95% CI: 0.0, 6.2]) while ORR was 
23.5% (95% CI: 6.8, 49.9) for haematological tumour cohort (N=17 response evaluable subjects). 
Among the 4 responders (all paediatric subjects), 1 complete response (CR) in HL and 3 partial

responses (PR) (2 with HL, 1 with NHL) were observed with nivolumab monotherapy for subjects with 
haematological tumours. Most response evaluable subjects treated with nivo monotherapy had either 
stable disease (SD, 28.0%) or progressive disease (PD, 58.7%). The median OS was 7.00 (95% CI: 
5.98, 14.06) months for solid tumours (N=60 treated subjects), and not reached for haematological 
tumours (N=20 treated subjects). Overall, the median OS was 11.07 (95% CI: 6.37, 27.63) months 
for nivo monotherapy (table 14). 
For nivo+ipi treatment (solid tumour only based on 43 response evaluable subjects), the ORR was 
4.7% (95%CI: 0.6, 15.8). Two PRs were observed with nivo +ipi for solid tumours (1 paediatric 
subject with Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET and 1 adult subject with rhabdomyosarcoma. The 
majority of the subjects with nivo + ipi treatment had PD (74.4%). The median OS was 8.87 (95% CI: 
5.75, 18.50) months for subjects treated with nivo + ipi (table 38).

 Of note, in the CA209070 Interim CSR Sections 7.1 and 7.2.1 texts, two 18-year-old subjects were inadvertently described as 
a paediatric subjects instead of adult. This affects 1 subject with PR in the nivo arm (with hematology tumour [HL]) and 1 subject 
with with PR in the nivo+ipi arm (solid tumour [Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET]). These 2 subjects were ≥18 years (adult) 
rather than the paediatric subjects (as noted in the Interim CSR Section 7.1 and 7.2.1). See Table S.5.5.2.1 in the Interim CSR; 
Table S. 11.1.1 and Table S.11.2.1 (ORR in paediatric subjects) in Appendix 2 of the SCE; (ORR, by age groups) for accurate 
information on responders in both the nivo and nivo+ipi arms.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
ORR and BOR results by pooled solid tumour vs haematology tumour vs total for all response evaluable 
population are presented in table 38 and results are described above. For nivo treated subjects with 
solid tumour, no objective response was observed; whereas for subjects with haematological tumour, 
1 paediatric subject (with Hodgkin lymphoma) had CR and 3 paediatric subjects (2 with Hodgkin 
lymphoma, 1 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma) had PR with an ORR of 23.5% (95% CI: 6.8, 49.9). For 
subjects with nivo + ipi treatment, there were 2 responders with PR (1 paediatric subject with Ewing 
sarcoma/peripheral PNET and 1 adult subject with rhabdomyosarcoma), with an ORR of 4.7% (95% 
CI: 0.6, 15.8). 
None of the B and D cohorts were expanded to stage 2 of the planned Simon’s two stage design. 
Results are also available by tumour type for all response evaluable population in table 31.

The status of censored subjects for OS overall by treatment, and by solid tumour or haematological 
tumour is presented in Table 33. For nivo treatment, 42/80 (52.5%) subjects were censored for OS at 
DBL. Of the censored subjects, only 1 subject with haematological tumour was still on-treatment, 25 
(31.3%) subjects were in follow-up, and 16 (20.0%) subjects were off study. For nivo + ipi treatment, 
19/46 (41.3%) subjects were censored for OS at DBL. Of the censored subjects, no subjects were still 
on-treatment, 5 (10.9%) subjects were in follow-up, and 14 subjects (30.4%) were off study.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumour cells membrane staining in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumour cells per validated Dako PD-L1 IHC assay. Analyses for tumour cell PD-L1 
expression were based on baseline PD-L1 ≥1% or <1%. 63/80 (78.8%) subjects with nivo treatment, 
and 39/46 (84.8%) subjects with nivo + ipi treatment had quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline. 
41 of 63 subjects (65.1%) with nivo treatment and 32 of 39 subjects (82.1%) with nivo + ipi 
treatment had baseline PD-L1 <1%. For subjects with haematological tumours, within the HL cohort, 
all 10 subjects had quantifiable PD-L1 at baseline, among them 9 (90.0%) subjects had PD-L1 ≥1%. 
In the NHL cohort, 8 out of 10 subjects had quantifiable PD-L1 at baseline, among them 6 (75.0%) 
subjects had PD-L1 ≥1%. For subjects with solid tumours (neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma/ peripheral 
PNET, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, solid tumour NOS), the majority of the subjects 
had PD-L1 <1%. 
Nivolumab Monotherapy 
Of the 80 subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy, 22 (27.5%) subjects had baseline PD-L1 
expression ≥1%, 41 (51.3%) subjects had PD-L1 expression <1%, and 17 (21.3%) subjects were 
without quantifiable PD-L1 at baseline (Table 18). Three paediatric subjects (2 with HL, 1 with NHL) in 
the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup had PR, and 1 paediatric subject (with HL) in the PD-L1 missing subgroup 
had CR. No subjects from the PD-L1 <1% subgroup had either CR or PR. Small subgroup sizes 
preclude firm conclusions. 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab 
Of the 46 subjects treated with nivo + ipi treatment, 7 (15.2%) subjects had baseline PD-L1 
expression ≥1%, 32 (69.6%) subjects had PD-L1 expression <1%, and 7 (15.2%) subjects were 
without quantifiable PD-L1 at baseline (Table 34). One paediatric subject in the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup

with Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET and 1 adult subject in the PD-L1 <1% subgroup with 
rhabdomyosarcoma had PR, and no subjects from the PD-L1 missing subgroup had either CR or PR.

Age Subgroups including Adolescent Population 
Nivolumab 
No major differences in OS and ORR were observed among the age subgroups (≥12 to <18 years, <18 
years, and ≥18 years). 
In subjects ≥12 to <18 years, responses were observed in 2 subjects with haematological tumours 
including 1 complete response in HL and 1 partial response in NHL (ORR 6.5% [95% CI: 0.8, 21.4]), 
while no responses were observed in subjects with solid tumours. Nine (29.0%) subjects ≥12 to <18 
years (5 subjects with solid tumours and 4 with haematology tumours) showed SD as the BOR (Table 
19).  
Among 2 responders ≥12 to <18 years with haematology tumours, TTR was 2.7 months for HL subject 
with CR and 8.6 months for NHL subject with PR. DOR was 1.0 month for HL subject with CR and 2.7 
months for NHL subject with PR; DOR was censored on the date of their last evaluable tumour 
assessment for subject with PR.  
In subjects ≥12 to <18 years, the 12-month OS rate was 46.6% (95% CI: 26.2%, 64.7%) and 24 
month OS was not reached (Table 42). 
Nivo+Ipi

There was one adolescent (15-year-old) subject with advanced melanoma in Part B who received 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg. This Asian, female subject had a Lansky performance status of 90, received prior 
lines of anticancer therapies (non-myelosuppressive chemotherapy and immunotherapies [interferon 
alpha and dendritic cells combined with cytokine-induced killer cells) and underwent surgery (3 
resections). 
The subject’s BOR was PD. During treatment, the only AE experienced by the subject was Grade 1 
constipation. The subject discontinued treatment due to PD and the subject died due to disease 
progression 137 days after receiving the last dose of nivolumab.

EMA/221125/2023  
Study CA209070 is a dose-confirmation and dose-expansion study of nivolumab 
with or without ipilimumab in paediatric and young adult (≤30 years) subjects 
with recurrent or refractory solid tumours including lymphoma. This COG clinical 
study is included as one of the agreed measures in both approved PIPs for 
nivolumab (procedures ref. EMEA-001407-PIP01-12-M03 and EMEA-001407-
PIP02-15-M05). 
The study consisted of 5 parts: 
• 
• 
• 
Part A: nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W in advanced solid tumours; subjects 1 - <18 
years. 
Part B: nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W in NBL, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, HL, 
NHL, MEL, NBL (MIGB only), RMS; subjects 1 – 30 years old. 
Part C: nivo+ipi dose escalation (2 dose levels) in advanced solid 
tumours; subjects 1 - <18 years. 
1.  Nivo 1 mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg Q3W x 4 cycles followed by nivo 3 mg/kg 
Q2W cycles 5+ until progression 
2.  Nivo 3 mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg Q3W x 4 cycles followed by nivo 3 mg/kg 
Q2W cycles 5+ until progression 
• 
• 
Part D: Nivo 3 mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg Q3W x 4 cycles followed by nivo 3 
mg/kg Q2W for cycles 5+ until progression in NBL, osteosarcoma, RMS, 
Ewing sarcoma, NHL, NBL (MIBG only); subjects 1-30 yrs 
Part E: Nivo 1 mg/kg + ipi 3 mg/kg Q3W x 4 cycles followed by nivo 3 
mg/kg Q2W cycles 5+ until progression in rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing 
sarcoma; subjects 1-30 yrs old

Efficacy 
At the pre-specified final OS analysis (28 months minimum follow-up for OS and ORR; 18 minimum 
months follow-up for PFS), both nivolumab and nivo+ipi demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in OS and PFS as well as in ORR compared to ipilimumab alone in adult subjects with 
advanced melanoma (Table 39). Of note, CA209067 was not designed to assess whether adding 
ipilimumab to nivolumab improves PFS or OS compared to nivolumab as a single agent, although 
exploratory analyses were provided.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This is an application for an extension of the approved indication for Yervoy (ipilimumab) in 
combination with Opdivo (nivolumab) for the treatment of advanced melanoma to include adolescent 
patients (12 years and older). 
This application is based on the results from study CA209070 (ADVL1412), included as one of the 
measures in the two approved Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIP) for nivolumab (procedures ref. 
EMEA-001407-PIP01-12-M03 and EMEA-001407-PIP02-15-M05). Supportive efficacy data are provided 
by study CA209067 (CheckMate 067), the pivotal trial on which the nivolumab and ipilimumab 
approvals (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0003 and EMEA/H/C/002213/II/0055) for the treatment of advanced 
melanoma were based. This study only enrolled adult patients. The similarity of melanoma, in terms of 
course of the disease and expected response to treatment, between adults and adolescents, is 
discussed below. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CA209070 is a phase 1/2 open-label trial of nivolumab and nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab in children, adolescents, and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumours. The 
study was initially planned with 3 parts (part A, B and C) with the aim to establish the RP2D for both 
nivolumab monotherapy (part A) and the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab (part C) and to 
evaluate toxicity of the nivolumab monotherapy RP2D in some disease specific cohorts (part B). The 
study protocol was later amended to include parts D and E. Part D allowed inclusion of patients from 
select cohorts in part B who had not progressed on nivolumab monotherapy to be further treated with 
the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab (nivo+ipi). Part E used an alternative dosing of nivolumab 1 
mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in comparison with the RP2D from part C (nivo 3mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg) in 
patients with rhabdomyosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. The study was designed to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability, assess antitumor effects, to determine whether the systemic 
nivolumab exposure in children is similar to the systemic exposure in adults and to evaluate the PK of 
nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab. 
The study enrolled patients from 12 months to 18 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumours 
without CNS tumours or CNS metastases in parts A, C and B7 (melanoma), and from 12 months to 
30 years of age in parts B and D. The disease specific cohorts in parts B and D enrolled patients with 
neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma or peripheral PNET, NHL, HL or 
melanoma (these two last diagnoses were available only in part B of the study). All included patients 
must not have any curative or proven to prolong survival therapy available at enrolment. 
Subjects included in parts A and B received nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W. There was a first 
dose level for part C consisting in nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for cycles 1 to 4, 
followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W until progression. If no DLTs were reported, the dose was 
escalated to nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for cycles 1 to 4, followed by nivolumab 3 
mg/kg Q2W until progression, and this was the dosing used for part D of the study. Nivolumab was 
administered over a 60 min infusion and ipilimumab during 90 minutes. 
There were maximum 375 subjects planned to be included in the whole study, based on a Simon’s 
optimal two-stage design, depending on the number of patients evaluable for response in each stage 
or cohort and the appearance or not of any DLT that would prevent or allow a cohort expansion.

EMA/221125/2023  
Page 92/129 
 
 
 
Additionally, within protocol Amendment 2A, in light of the observed activity for nivolumab in adult 
patients with melanoma, a cohort with non-statistical design was opened (part B7) to enrolment of 
patients with unresectable, metastatic, relapsed, or refractory melanoma. 
Analyses were performed on all treated subjects per treatment group and cohort, also by pooling 
patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy or the combination, separating solid tumours and 
hematologic malignancies. Additional analyses by disease diagnosis and age category were included.  
The original protocol version, dated 16-Jan-2015, was provided. According to the MAH, up to the latest 
DBL, 12 global amendments were issued that resulted in new versions of the study protocol and these 
have been submitted but, apparently, other region-specific amendments were also performed, without 
relevant changes; as the first included version (after the original) is Amendment 1A and the next 
version is Amendment 2C, where, in fact, a reference to the melanoma cohort (part B7) having been 
added in Amendment 2A/2B has been found. Part D was included by Amendment 4, in order to assess 
the activity of the combination of nivo+ipi for select disease cohorts which had not progressed beyond 
initial part B due to the lack of responses to monotherapy. The rationale behind this change was based 
on recently published new data that reported that pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) had shown little activity 
in osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma combined with the fact that, in melanoma, response rates were 
higher with the combination compared to nivolumab monotherapy in adults. However, a melanoma 
cohort in Part D was never planned. Of note, the protocol of study CA209067 (supportive) only allowed 
the inclusion of subjects ≥18 years old. Amendment 6 (24-Feb-2017) included assessment of cardiac 
function based on the occurrence of myocarditis in patients using ipilimumab + nivolumab in other 
studies. By Amendment 10 (31-Jul-2019), infusion time for nivolumab was reduced from 60 to 30 min. 
Although there were 91 important protocol deviations reported in this study with 21 of them 
categorised as major protocol deviations, these deviations were not considered relevant based on the 
reports from internal audits of the study provided by the sponsor. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 132 subjects were enrolled and 126 were treated. Baseline demographics in all treated 
subjects were balanced between the nivo and nivo+ipi treatment groups. Ninety-seven subjects were 
<18 years old and, among them, 53 subjects ≥12 to <18 years old. A minimum follow-up of 14 
months has been reported for all patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy (n=80) and 28 months 
for patients treated with the combination (n=46). The median follow-up for all patients treated in the 
study was 44 months. At the DBL (30-Sep-2019 for nivolumab patients and 30-Jun-2020 for nivo+ipi 
subjects), only one patient with HL in part B5 was still on treatment. The most common reason for 
treatment discontinuation was disease progression. A high percentage of patients (67.2% of the 
subjects treated with nivolumab and 93.9% from the subjects treated with the combination) were not 
continuing in the study at the time of the DBL, most of them due to death but there were also some 
patients who withdrew consent, enrolled in other studies or were lost to follow-up. By treatment, 64 
patients <18 years old received nivolumab monotherapy in parts A and B while 33 patients <18 years 
old received the combination in parts C and D. Focusing on adolescents (≥12 to <18 years old), 33 
subjects received nivolumab and 20 subjects received nivolumab + ipilimumab. Regarding baseline 
PD-L1 expression per validated Dako PD-L1 IHC assay, there were 63 (78.8%) evaluable patients from 
those who were treated with nivolumab and 39 (84.8%) evaluable patients treated with the 
combination. Among those PD-L1 evaluable subjects, 34.9% of the subjects treated with nivo 
monotherapy and 17.9% of the patients treated with nivo+ipi presented a baseline PD-L1 expression 
≥1%. Baseline PD-L1 expression for the only melanoma patient enrolled was missing. From the 80 
patients who were treated with nivolumab monotherapy, there were 20 neuroblastoma, 13 
osteosarcoma, 11 rhabdomyosarcoma, 11 Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET, 10 Hodgkin lymphoma and 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 93/129 
 
 
 
another 10 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1 melanoma and 4 subjects diagnosed with other solid tumours. 
Among the 46 patients treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab, there were one neuroblastoma, 13 
osteosarcoma, 10 rhabdomyosarcoma, another 10 with Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET and 12 
patients diagnosed with other solid tumours. 
Efficacy endpoints included ORR, TTR, DOR and OS, and all analyses were descriptive. For nivolumab 
monotherapy, no objective response was observed for the solid tumours cohorts (from 58 response 
evaluable subjects including melanoma) while ORR was 23.5% (95% CI: 6.8, 49.9) for the 
haematological tumours cohort (N=17 response evaluable subjects). For nivo+ipi treatment (solid 
tumour only, based on 43 response evaluable subjects), the ORR was 4.7% (95% CI: 0.6, 15.8). 
Considering that there were only four responders, the longest reported DOR was 2.8 months, in 
addition to one patient whose DOR was reported as 2.7 months but was censored on the date of their 
last evaluable tumour assessment. There were 21 (28%) patients who reported stable disease from 
those treated with nivolumab and 7 (16.3%) subjects treated with nivo+ipi with stable disease. The 
only advanced melanoma patient included (female, Asian 15-year-old) reported a BOR of PD, 
discontinued treatment due to progression and died 137 days after the last nivolumab dose. 
OS was also reported with a 47.5% of events in the nivo monotherapy group and 58.7% of events in 
the combination pooled group. Overall, the median OS was 11.07 (95% CI: 6.37, 27.63) months for 
nivo monotherapy and 8.87 (95% CI: 5.75, 18.50) months for subjects treated with nivo + ipi. Among 
those patients treated with nivolumab, median OS was 7.00 (95% CI: 5.98, 14.06) months for solid 
tumours (N=60 treated subjects), and not reached for haematological tumours (N=20 treated 
subjects). No further information about subsequent therapies received by enrolled patients is available. 
Response by PD-L1 tumour expression was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. From the 80 subjects 
treated with nivo monotherapy, 22 (27.5%) presented a baseline PD-L1 tumour expression ≥1%. Of 
these 22 patients, no CR were observed and 3 PR were reported. Eight (36.4%) patients presented 
with SD and 9 (40.9%) reported PD. From the 41 (51.3%) subjects treated with nivo who reported a 
PD-L1 expression <1%, no responses were observed while 9 (22%) subjects reported SD and 25 
(61%) presented PD. Of the 46 subjects treated with nivo + ipi treatment, 7 (15.2%) subjects had 
baseline PD-L1 expression ≥1% and 32 (69.6%) subjects had PD-L1 expression <1%. There was only 
one PR in the PD-L1 ≥1% group while there were three SD and PD, respectively. For the PD-L1 <1% 
group treated with the combination, there was also one PR but 4 (12.5%) SD and 24 (75%) PD 
reported. 
The main efficacy endpoints (ORR and OS) were analysed by age subgroups (≥12 to <18 years, <18 
years, and ≥18 years) and no relevant differences were observed although these subgroups had a 
small size which precludes definitive conclusions. 
Supportive Study CA209067 
This phase 3 randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combined with 
ipilimumab versus ipilimumab monotherapy in subjects with previously untreated, unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma provides data for nivolumab monotherapy and nivo+ipi in subjects ≥18 years in 
the approved advanced melanoma indication in adult patients.  
Study CA209067 has been assessed in multiple procedures, from the extension of the indication 
variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0003) to the latest update, up to 7.5 years of follow-up 
(EMEA/H/C/WS2289). This study did not allow the inclusion of patients <18 years old. A total of 945 
patients were randomized either to receive nivolumab monotherapy (n=316), nivo+ipi (n=314) or 
ipilimumab monotherapy, which was the comparator arm (n=315). The extension of the indication was 
granted based on the final and interim analysis for the co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS, 
respectively, (DBL 17-Feb-2015) and an updated exploratory analysis (DBL 13-Nov-2015). The final 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 94/129 
 
 
 
OS analysis was performed based on a DBL of 13-Sep-2016. In this analysis, an OS HR of 0.63 (98% 
CI: 0.48, 0.81) was estimated for the comparison of nivolumab vs. ipilimumab monotherapy an HR 
0.55 (98% CI: 0.42, 0.72) for the comparison of nivo+ipi vs. ipilimumab. Median OS was NA for the 
experimental arms and 19.98 (95% CI: 17.08, 24.61) for the ipilimumab monotherapy arm. The HR 
point estimates for PFS were 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.66) for the comparison of nivolumab vs. 
ipilimumab monotherapy and 0.42 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.51) for nivo+ipi vs. ipilimumab. For the latest 
update (12-Nov-2021 DBL), OS estimated HR was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.77) for the comparison 
between nivolumab and ipilimumab monotherapy and 0.53 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.65) for nivo+ipi vs. 
ipilimumab. Estimated median OS were 36.93 (95% CI: 28.25, 58.71) months for the nivolumab arm, 
72.08 (95% CI: 38.18, NA) months for nivo+ipi and 19.94 (95% CI: 16.85, 24.61) months for the 
ipilimumab arm. 
Efficacy of both nivolumab monotherapy and the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab have been 
widely established for adult patients. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The totality of the paediatric data generated according to the agreed PIP01 for nivolumab (EMEA-C-
001407-PIP01-12-M03, adopted by PDCO on 21 January 2022) are provided as part of this application, 
in order to fulfil regulatory requirements. The updates proposed to the SmPC are therefore intended to 
reflect the clinical safety and efficacy data for the entire paediatric population included in Parts A to D 
of study CA209070 (N = 97 patients aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years), Study 2 of PIP01 and pivotal clinical 
trial for this application, covering all the paediatric tumour types (solid and haematological tumours) 
and treatment regimens (nivo and nivo+ipi) studied and not limited to melanoma. 
Efficacy data for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in the treatment of adolescent patients 
with advanced melanoma are not available. The efficacy of nivolumab+ipilimumab in adolescents with 
melanoma could not be assessed in study CA209070 as only one melanoma patient was enrolled, and 
she was treated with nivolumab monotherapy. In addition, other adolescents enrolled in study 
CA209070 treated with this combination, all diagnosed with solid tumours, received the RP2D 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg instead of the approved dose for this combination for the 
treatment of advanced melanoma in adults: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. It is then 
necessary to extrapolate results from the adult population included in study CA209067 to support the 
efficacy of this combination in adolescent patients with advanced melanoma. On the basis of similarity 
of the disease in adult and adolescent patients with melanoma, and the expected similarity in the 
exposure-response to nivolumab and nivo+ipi treatment, the efficacy of nivolumab-based regimens in 
adolescents is expected to be similar to that of adults. Literature references were also provided in 
support of this extrapolation plan (data not shown). 
It is acknowledged that a similar approach has been used in relevant precedents, highlighting that the 
biological similarity of the disease between adults and adolescents is recognised. However, emerging 
data could indicate that this is not the case for all paediatric cancers tested. In several trials with anti 
PD-1/PD-L1 agents limited responses to monotherapy have been reported in most common paediatric 
(solid) tumours included. Indeed, the overall positive results in such trials appear to be (mainly) driven 
by HL enrolled patients, a fact that could be related to an overexpression of PD-L1/PD-L2 in these 
haematological cancers. Very limited data have been found for these agents used in combination, apart 
from study CA209070.  There are some publications suggesting that most paediatric solid tumours 
show low TMB, which is not unexpected as these cancers are not usually the result of exposure to 
carcinogens like tobacco or UV light. The lack of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has also been 
mentioned as a possible explanation for the lack of response in paediatric tumours. In addition, 
paediatric solid tumours seem to present a less-inflamed microenvironment than tumours in adult

patients, for the same reasons exposed above. However, melanoma in adolescents is supposed to 
share most biological characteristics with adult melanoma (constituting the basis for this extrapolation 
approach), related to UV exposure in many cases, which should leave it out from these expected low 
responses to ICIs reported in other paediatric tumours. 
The MAH has provided a brief discussion on the disease similarity between melanoma in adult and 
adolescent patients to allow the proposed extrapolation approach and a review of evidence on this 
topic. Some studies have shown that the presence of somatic mutations in BRAF and PTEN were higher 
in the group of adolescents and young adults (15-30 years old) in comparison with older adults, 
suggesting that these young patients contained a higher proportion of mutation signatures unrelated to 
UV radiation, which is to be expected since exposure to radiation is shorter for them. This was also 
observed in a study using data from the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR), where 
adolescents and young adults received more targeted therapy for 1L treatment. Although the incidence 
of BRAF mutated melanomas in adolescents may be higher, there seems to be no data suggesting that 
the behaviour and prognosis of these patients might be different. A meta-analysis has also been 
provided where no significant differences in TMB were found between adolescents and young adults 
and older patients (40-94 years). The available data on the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors for 
the treatment of melanoma in adolescent patients is very limited but the provided information seems 
to confirm that the differences in the reported responses are not due to differential characteristics 
between melanoma in adolescents and older adults. 
Based on the similarity of the tumour biology in adolescents vs. adults and the expected similarity of 
response to treatment, data in adults from Study CA209067 are considered to be applicable to the 
requested indication expansion for adolescent patients. 
The extrapolation concept is based on that comparable drug exposure will lead to comparable efficacy 
but no exposure-efficacy analysis has been provided (see pharmacology section). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Only one melanoma adolescent patient was enrolled in study CA209070 who received nivolumab 
monotherapy and showed PD as BOR. No clinical data are available for the combination in adolescents 
with melanoma. Therefore, this application basically relies on the extrapolation of efficacy data from 
adult patients in the same disease setting. Nivolumab and in combination with ipilimumab, was 
approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on the results from the phase 3 study 
CA902067, which is considered supportive to this application. Considering the drug behaves similarly 
and a comparable exposure-response to treatment can be expected between adults and adolescents, 
and that the disease biology can be considered similar in the two populations, the proposed 
extrapolation approach is considered acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data in support of the applied extension of the indication for the treatment of adolescents with 
advanced melanoma is based on the results from study CA209070. This is a multicentre, open-label, 
single arm, phase 1/2 trial of nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in children, adolescents and young adults with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumours or lymphomas. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 96/129 
 
 
 
The primary objectives of this study included: to determine the tolerability, and define and describe 
the toxicities of nivolumab administered as a single agent in children with relapsed or refractory solid 
tumours at the adult recommended dose of 3 mg/kg, and to determine the MTD and/or RP2D and to 
define and describe the toxicities of nivolumab plus ipilimumab administered to children. 
As only one melanoma adolescent patient was included in the study and she was treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy, no safety data for the combination of nivolumab +ipilimumab are available in 
<18-year old patients. This application is mainly based on extrapolation from data on adult patients in 
the same indication and, to support this approach, results from the already assessed study CA209067 
have been provided under the claim that melanoma is a similar disease between adolescent and adult 
patients. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 132 subjects were enrolled (85 enrolled to nivolumab and 47 to nivo + ipi), and 126 subjects 
were treated (80 treated with nivolumab and 46 with nivo + ipi). 
As of the DBLs (30-Sep-2019 for Parts A and B and 30-Jun-2020 for Parts C and D), only 1 subject 
receiving nivolumab was still on treatment. No subjects receiving nivo + ipi were still on treatment. 
There was an overall minimum follow-up for survival of 14.0 months for subjects treated with 
nivolumab, and 28.3 months for subjects treated with nivo + ipi. The median follow-up time for all 
subjects treated with nivolumab or nivo + ipi was 44.0 months. 
The percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment in both the nivolumab and nivo + ipi arms was 
similar, with clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive disease of >40% increase in target lesions 
being the most common reason (tables 1 and 2 for subjects <18 years of age).

Nivolumab monotherapy 
Among subjects in Parts A and B, the median number of nivolumab doses received was 2 (range: 1 - 
89), see Table 43. The median duration of nivolumab treatment was 0.84 months (0.53 months for 
solid tumours and 1.23 months for hematology tumours). 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab 
Among subjects in Parts C and D, the median number of doses received was 2.0 (range: 1 - 24) for 
nivolumab and 2.0 (range: 1 - 4) for ipilimumab, see Table 43. The median duration of nivo + ipi 
treatment for solid tumours was 0.72 months.

Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) 
DLT was defined as any of the investigator and recorded on the case report form (CRF). DLT was 
defined as any of the non-hematological and hematological DLTs that were possibly, probably, or 
definitely attributable to protocol therapy. The DLT observation period was Cycle 1 (the first 28 days 
for Part A and 21 days for Part C). Toxicities with subsequent cycles were also monitored. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 99/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Per the study design, Part A defined RP2D for Part B. Similarly, Part C defined RP2D for Part D. The 
dose determination in Part A and Part C was done by COG at the time of study conduct and Part A 
results were published. 
Nivolumab monotherapy 
In Part A, the DLT observation period was the first cycle of treatment (28 days). A total of 12 subjects 
were treated with nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W. No DLTs were observed, therefore the dose was not de-
escalated and the RP2D for Part B was determined as nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W (Table 45). In Part B, Cycle 1 
DLT rate was below 33% (pre-specified rate) in all cohorts tested, showing that nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W did 
not exceed the MTD in any of the cohorts tested.  
In addition, DLT equivalents were evaluated beyond Cycle 1 in Part A and regardless of cycle in Part B 
for all treated subjects in Parts A and B. Among the 80 subjects evaluated for DLT equivalents, 12 
(15.0%) had a total of 18 DLT equivalents (Table 46). 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab 
In Part C, the DLT observation period was the first cycle of treatment (21 days). A total of 6 subjects 
were treated with nivo 1 + ipi 1 Q3W (dose level 1), and no DLTs were observed. Therefore, the dose 
was escalated to nivo 3 + ipi 1 Q3W (dose level 2). Among the 12 subjects treated with nivo 3 + ipi 1 
Q3W for DLT evaluation, 1 DLT was observed on Day 14 (blood creatinine increased), which was within 
the predefined occurrence of <2 DLTs to be considered ‘safe.’ Therefore, the RP2D for Part D was 
determined as nivo 3 + ipi 1 Q3W (Table 45). In Part D, Cycle 1 DLT rate was below 33% (pre-
specified rate) in all disease cohorts tested, showing that nivo 3 + ipi 1 Q3W did not exceed the MTD in 
any of these disease cohorts. 
In addition, DLT equivalents were evaluated beyond Cycle 1 in Part C and regardless of cycle in Part D 
for all treated subjects in Parts C and D. Among the 46 subjects evaluated for DLT equivalents, 6 
(13.0%) had a total of 21 DLT equivalents; 1 DLT equivalent for nivo 1 + ipi 1 Q3W and 20 DLT 
equivalents in 5 subjects for nivo 1 + ipi 3 Q3W (Table 46).

Deaths 
Nivolumab 
Among the 80 subjects treated with nivolumab, 38 (47.5%) subjects had died; 34/60 (56.7%) 
subjects in solid tumour group and 4/20 (20.0%) subjects in hematology tumour group (Table 49). For 
subjects with solid and hematology tumours, disease progression was the most common cause of 
death, including within 30 days and 100 days of the last dose. One subject with relapsed or refractory 
non-Hodgkin tumour died due to intraparenchymal hematoma, 57 days after the last dose. There were 
no deaths due to study drug toxicity. 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab 
Among the 46 subjects with solid tumours treated with nivo + ipi, 27 (58.7%) had died (Table 49). 
Disease progression was the most common cause of death, including within 30 days and 100 days of 
the last dose. The cause of death was not reported for 1 subject who died 1307 days after the last 
dose of study drug. There were no deaths assessed as related to study drug toxicity.

Immune mediated adverse event (IMAEs) 
IMAEs could not be derived for CA209070 based on the CRF design. Therefore, a listing of modified 
IMAEs was generated, which consisted of a listing of AEs up to 100 days after the last dose that had 
PTs in the list of “IMAE PTs” regardless of whether or not the subject received immune-modulating 
medication and regardless of investigator attribution. 
Nivolumab monotherapy 
Among the 80 subjects treated with nivolumab, any-grade modified IMAEs reported in ≥ 20% of 
subjects were as follows: 
•  Hepatitis events: 49 (61.3%) subjects,  
•  Nephritis and renal dysfunction events: 24 (30.0%) subjects, 
•  Rash events: 23 (28.8%) subjects, and  
•  Diarrhea/colitis events: 21 (26.3%) subjects.

treated with nivolumab. 
Other events of special interest (OESIs) 
OESIs are events that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as select AEs or IMAEs. These events may 
differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require immunosuppression as part of their 
management. OESIs included the following categories: demyelination, encephalitis, graft versus host 
disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, myocarditis, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, 
pancreatitis, and uveitis. Analyses of OESIs had extended follow up (100 days window). 
Nivolumab monotherapy 
Among the 80 subjects treated with nivolumab, 3 (3.8%) experienced an OESI: 1 subject with drug 
related Grade 2 AE of pancreatitis, 1 with drug-related Grade 2 AE of pancreatitis, and 1 with unrelated 
Grade 3 AE of graft versus host disease in the setting of allogeneic transplant. All cases were resolved. 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab 
Among the 46 subjects treated with nivo + ipi, 2 (4.3%) experienced an OESI: 1 subject with drug 
related Grade 2 AE of uveitis and 1 with drug-related Grade 3 SAE of pancreatitis. Both cases were 
resolved.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The assessment of the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of 
advanced melanoma in adolescents is based on the safety results from study CA209070. Supportive 
data come from study CA209067, which was the pivotal trial for the approval of this combination for 
adult patients in the same disease setting. 
The assessment of the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of 
advanced melanoma in adolescents is based on the safety results from study CA209070. A total of 126 
subjects received, at least, one treatment dose in study CA209070 and constitute the Safety 
Population. Among these patients, 80 were treated with nivolumab monotherapy and 46 with 
nivolumab + ipilimumab. A total of 97 paediatric patients aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years, 53 patients 
12 to < 18 years, were treated in study CA209070. Supportive data come from study CA209067, 
which was the pivotal trial for the approval of this combination for adult patients in the same disease 
setting. There was an overall minimum follow-up for survival of 14.0 months for subjects treated with 
nivolumab, and 28.3 months for subjects treated with nivo + ipi. Among subjects who received 
nivolumab monotherapy (parts A and B), the median number of nivolumab doses received was 2 
(range: 1 - 89) and, for nivolumab + ipilimumab, the median number of doses was 2.0 (range: 1 - 24) 
for nivolumab and 2.0 (range: 1 - 4) for ipilimumab, as only 4 ipilimumab doses were recommended 
as RP2D by the study protocol, also in line with other studies and the approved indication for adult 
patients with melanoma. 
The overall safety profile nivo + ipi in study CA209070, as assessed by the incidence of SAEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation, AEs, and select AEs, seems consistent with that seen in the adult studies 
nivo + ipi across tumour types. There were no new safety signals identified. There were no toxicities 
noted that were specific to a given disease cohort. 
The nivolumab + ipilimumab dosing regimen for this study (nivo 3 mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg x 4 doses) 
was selected based on the fact that none of the 6 patients treated with the starting dose of nivo 1 
mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg reported any DLT and, among the 12 subjects treated with nivo 3 mg/kg + ipi 1 
mg/kg (dose level 2), only one DLT was observed which was within the predefined occurrence of <2 
DLTs to establish the RP2D. This mentioned DLT was observed on Day 14 of the first treatment cycle 
and reported as blood creatinine increased. 
All-causality any-grade AEs were reported in 46 (100.0%) subjects treated with nivo + ipi, while all 
causality Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 23 from the 46 (50.0%) subjects treated with nivo + ipi. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 119/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Drug-related any-grade AEs were reported in all 46 treated subjects, being the most commonly 
observed: lymphocyte count decrease (43.5%), anaemia (41.3) and fatigue (34.8%). ALT increase, 
platelet count decrease, white cell count decrease and nausea were also commonly reported. 
There were no deaths assessed as related to study drug toxicity in study CA209070. Most deaths were 
due to disease progression but there was one subject treated with nivolumab (NHL) who died due to 
intraparenchymal hematoma secondary to disease progression 57 days after the last treatment dose 
and another patient treated with the combination who died due to unknown causes. Other deaths were 
reported as due to respiratory failure and one case of cardiac arrest, all in the context of disease 
progression. 
Regarding SAEs, all-causality any-grade SAEs (within 100 days of last dose) were reported in 20 
(43.5%) subjects treated with nivo + ipi and all-causality Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 12 (26.1%) 
subjects. Drug-related any-grade SAEs were reported in 9 (19.6%) subjects treated with nivolumab + 
ipilimumab while drug-related Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported by 7 (15.2%) subjects. Drug-related 
Grade 3-4 SAEs reported in ≥2 subjects were: ALT increase, AST increase, hyponatremia and pleural 
effusion (4.3%) each. 
Select AEs included the usual categories along nivolumab and ipilimumab clinical development: 
endocrine, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin, and hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. As 
expected, most common select AEs fall into the categories of hepatic, endocrine and skin for both 
nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab. Drug-related serious select AEs included hepatic 
enzymes elevations as the most commonly reported. 
In Study CA209070, IMAEs data could not be directly obtained due to the design of the case report 
form, so a list of IMAEs was generated from AEs (up to 100 days after the last treatment dose) 
observed as PTs included in an “IMAE PTs” list, regardless of whether or not the subject received 
immune-modulating medication and regardless of investigator attribution. In both subjects treated 
with either nivolumab monotherapy or the combination, any grade IMAEs were reported by ≥20% of 
subjects. In patients treated with the nivolumab + ipilimumab combination, the most frequently 
reported Grade 3-4 IMAEs were hepatitis events (13%). Similarly to other nivolumab and ipilimumab 
studies performed in a wide variety of disease settings, for both the monotherapy and the 
combination, the most common any-grade IMAEs were hepatitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction, rash 
and diarrhoea/colitis; all of them reported in more of the 25% of treated subjects. The MAH provided a 
tabular summary of IMAEs separated by age groups of adolescents (≥12 to < 18) and young adults 
(≥18 years) from study CA209070. Considering the limited sample sizes, it is difficult to reach any 
conclusion based on the available data so, in the clinical practice, adolescent patients should be closely 
monitored for an early detection of these events, similarly to adults.  
Focusing on events defined as OESIs, the 46 subjects treated with the combination, one patient 
reported an event of uveitis and another one a drug-related Grade 3 event of pancreatitis. 
Data on safety in special populations have been analysed by age, gender, race and ethnicity. The 
safety profile of both nivolumab monotherapy and the combination seems comparable between age 
subgroups (< 12 years, ≥ 12 years to <18 years, and ≥18 years of age). Unfortunately, subgroups are 
too small to draw any conclusion from these analyses. However, by reviewing tabular summaries for 
patients <18 and ≥18 years, there seems to be a slight trend for a worse toxicity in terms of higher 
incidences of reported SOC and PTs events for patients <18 years old. Considering that only the 
adolescent (≥12 years to < 18 years) subgroup is the target population of this extension of the 
indication, a tabular comparison between safety data for the treated adolescents and adults in study 
CA209070 was provided. Some differences in the reported SOC and PT incidences are observed, as

expected considering the small number of subjects included, but they are not considered relevant in 
the clinical scenario where this study was performed. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The totality of the paediatric data generated according to the agreed PIP01 for nivolumab (EMEA-C-
001407-PIP01-12-M03, adopted by PDCO on 21 January 2022) are provided as part of this application, 
in order to fulfil regulatory requirements. The updates proposed to the SmPC are therefore intended to 
reflect the clinical safety for the entire paediatric population included in Parts A to D of study 
CA209070 (N = 97 patients aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years), Study 2 of PIP01 and pivotal clinical trial for 
this application, covering all the paediatric tumour types (solid and haematological tumours) and 
treatment regimens (nivo and nivo+ipi) studied and not limited to melanoma. 
Despite the results reported above, from a safety perspective the proposed extension of the indication 
to adolescents relies on extrapolation of (safety) data for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
from adult patients in the same disease setting (Study CA209067), due to the absence of clinical data 
in adolescents with advanced melanoma. 
Study CA209067 has been thoroughly assessed since the initial melanoma indication application and 
multiple later updates. A tabular comparison of incidences for the main AEs items between data from 
study CA209067 (DBL 16-Sept-2016) and results from study CA209070 for both the all-treated 
population and patients <18 years old has been submitted but comparisons are not possible since 
different nivolumab+ipilimumab doses were administered in both studies.  
Patients in study CA209070 received nivo 3 mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg but patients randomized to the 
combination in study CA209067 received nivo 1 mg/kg + ipi 3 mg/kg, which is the approved dosing for 
adults in the advanced melanoma setting and also the recommended dose for the extension of the 
indication application to treat adolescents. This is the main reason why study CA209070 is not 
adequate to support the safety assessment of nivo+ipi for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 
adolescent patients. 
The approved dose of nivo+ipi for the treatment of advanced melanoma in adults presents a 
remarkable toxicity, higher than the observed toxicity with other combination indications where the 
administered doses for nivolumab and ipilimumab are the same as used in study CA209070. This 
difference, which is expected to be observed in adolescents too, added to the initial concerns regarding 
the performed model-based simulations that do not seem to capture the expected higher incidence of 
AEs in adolescents (based on expected higher exposure), gave rise to concern in relation to the 
acceptability of the full extrapolation approach proposed (see section 2.3.4). Of note, data on the use 
of ipilimumab, at different doses (3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg), in paediatric population is 
available from studies CA184070 and CA184078, where patients with advanced melanoma were 
treated, although with a very small sample size (data not shown). Although there is no available 
clinical data of the use of nivo+ipi in adolescent patients with advanced melanoma, the acceptability of 
the proposed indication relies on a full extrapolation approach that is agreeable also from a safety 
point of view. As for long-term safety data, the MAH proposed to extend the ongoing post-
authorization long-term follow-up safety study CA184557 to include paediatric patients treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in the DMTR, as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity (see RMP).

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Key safety results are summarized in Sections 4.8 of the SmPC. The most common adverse reactions 
(reported in at least 20% of paediatric patients) for ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab were 
fatigue (33.3%) and rash maculo-papular (21.2%). The majority of adverse reactions reported for 
ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab were of Grades 1 or 2 in severity. Ten patients (30%) had 
one or more Grades 3 to 4 adverse reactions. 
The safety of the combination (nivolumab 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg every 3 weeks for the first 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy every 2 
weeks) was evaluated in 97 paediatric patients aged ≥ 1 year to < 18 years (including 53 patients 12 
to < 18 years) with recurrent or refractory solid or haematological tumours, including advanced 
melanoma, in clinical study CA209070. The safety profile in paediatric patients was generally similar to 
that seen in adults. No new safety signals were observed. 
Study CA209070 did not enrol any melanoma patient to be treated with the combination and the 
dosing used is not the same as that approved for melanoma adult patients, which is also the one 
proposed for the extension of the indication to treat adolescents. For these reasons, the safety 
assessment of this application relies mainly in a full extrapolation approach based on clinical data in 
adults from the already assessed studiy CA209067. As previously concluded, based on an acceptable 
extrapolation approach, the well characterised safety profile can be considered extrapolated to 
adolescents. Long-term safety in adolescent patients is reflected in the RMP as missing information and 
expected to be further characterized in DMTR (study CA184557). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

a  The  primary  CSR  for  CA209908  was  completed  and  reported  to  fulfil  the  obligation  set  out  by  Article  46  of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (the ‘Paediatric Regulation’) for both OPDIVO and YERVOY. In the YERVOY PSUR 
#14, this study was listed as completed. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. It is considered that the submitted type II variation to extend 
the currently approved indications for Yervoy (ipilimumab) to include the treatment in combination 
with nivolumab in adolescents (≥12 to <18 years) for advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma, does not have a relevant impact on the PIL text. Therefore, the MAH’s justification to not 
undertake further consultation with target patient groups is considered acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This is an extension of the indication to adolescents 12 years of age and older for ipilimumab in 
combination with nivolumab for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Although melanoma is rare in paediatric patients, the risk of developing melanoma grows significantly 
in adolescents and young adults, and represents the second most common type of cancer in this age 
group.  Most melanomas occurring in adolescents are conventional or adult subtypes of melanoma.  
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 125/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no established standard treatment for paediatric patients with advanced melanoma. 
Ipilimumab as monotherapy was approved in 2018 (Yervoy, EMEA/H/C/002213/II/0044) for the 
treatment of patients ≥12 years in this same setting based on a partial extrapolation approach. An 
extension of indication for pembrolizumab was granted in June 2022 (Keytruda, 
EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0111) to include adolescents in the treatment of advanced melanoma 
therapeutic indication. While there have been advances in the treatment of melanoma in adults, 
treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma in the paediatric population remain unfulfilled. Because of 
the rarity of paediatric melanoma, accruing adequate numbers of paediatric participants for clinical 
studies to evaluate treatment in advanced setting is very difficult and treatment of children is often 
based on information from adult studies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence in support of the claimed extension of the indication is based on data from study 
CA209070, an investigator-sponsored phase 1/2 open-label trial of nivolumab in children, adolescents, 
and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumours as a single agent and in combination with 
ipilimumab. A total of 132 subjects were enrolled and 126 were treated. Ninety-seven subjects were 
<18 years old and, among them, 53 subjects ≥12 to <18 years old. Overall, 80 patients were treated 
with nivolumab monotherapy and 46 nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. 
To support the proposed extrapolation approach results from study CA209067, which was the basis for 
the authorization of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in the 
advanced melanoma setting in adults, have been provided.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study CA209070, for nivolumab monotherapy, no objective response was observed in the solid 
tumour cohorts (from 58 response evaluable subjects including melanoma) while the ORR was 23.5% 
(95% CI: 6.8, 49.9) in the haematological tumour cohort (N=17 response evaluable subjects). For 
nivo+ipi treatment (solid tumour only, based on 43 response evaluable subjects), the ORR was 4.7% 
(95% CI: 0.6, 15.8).  
In the population of adolescent subjects (≥12 to < 18 years) specifically, ORR in patients with 
haematological tumours was 6.5% (95% CI: 0.8, 21.4) (1 CR in HL and 1 PR in NHL) in subjects 
treated with nivolumab (N = 31), and there were no objective responses in subjects treated with 
ipi+nivo (N = 19). 
OS was reported in the overall population of study CA209070 with 47.5% of events in the nivo 
monotherapy group and 58.7% of events in the combination pooled group having occurred. Overall, 
the median OS was 11.07 (95% CI: 6.37, 27.63) months for nivo monotherapy and 8.87 (95% CI: 
5.75, 18.50) months for subjects treated with nivo + ipi.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The administered doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab in study CA209070 are not the same as 
approved for adult patients (study CA209067) nor the recommended doses for adolescents within this 
procedure which are based upon extrapolation of data from adult patients and modelling and 
simulation studies. 
OS data reported in study CA209070 are difficult to interpret in a single-arm design. 
Assessment report  
EMA/221125/2023  
Page 126/129 
 
 
 
Limited clinical efficacy data are available in adolescent subjects with melanoma, i.e. in study 
CA209070 only one adolescent with advanced melanoma was treated with nivolumab as monotherapy 
and reported PD as BOR. No definitive conclusions can therefore be drawn regarding efficacy of 
nivolumab (alone or in combination) in adolescent subjects with melanoma based on experimental 
data.  
However, this application relies on extrapolation of data obtained in adult patients based on the 
principles that disease biology is similar in both the adult and adolescent population, and on the 
assumption that the drugs behave similarly and comparable exposure-response to treatment can be 
expected between adults and adolescents. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All-causality any-grade AEs were reported in 46 (100.0%) subjects treated with nivo + ipi, while all 
causality Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 23 from the 46 (50.0%) subjects treated with nivo + ipi. 
Drug-related any-grade AEs were reported in all 46 treated subjects, being the most commonly 
observed: lymphocyte count decreased (43.5%), anaemia (41.3) and fatigue (34.8%). 
Regarding SAEs, all-causality (within 100 days of last dose) were reported in 20 (43.5%) subjects 
treated with nivo + ipi and all-causality Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 12 (26.1%) subjects.  
Any grade IMAEs were reported by ≥20% of subjects. In patients treated with the nivolumab + 
ipilimumab combination, the most frequently reported Grade 3-4 IMAEs were hepatitis events (13%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A comparison between data from study CA209067 and results from study CA209070 for both the all-
treated population and patients <18 years old has been submitted. However, a direct comparison is 
not possible due to the different disease settings and the fact that different doses for nivolumab + 
ipilimumab were administered in the studies. 
The approved dose of nivo + ipi for the treatment of advanced melanoma in adults (nivo 1 mg/kg + ipi 
3 mg/kg) presents a remarkable toxicity, higher than that observed in other combination indications 
where the administered doses for nivolumab and ipilimumab are the same used in study CA209070 
(nivo 3 mg/kg + ipi 1 mg/kg). This difference is expected to be observed in adolescents too (relevant 
aspects are reflected in SmPC 4.2 and 4.8). 
Long-term safety in adolescent patients is missing this is reflected in the RMP as missing information 
and expected to be further characterized in DMTR (study CA184557).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results from study CA209070 that included paediatric patients (12 months to <18 years) and young 
adults (≤30 years) with recurrent or refractory solid (including melanoma) and haematology (only 
lymphoma) tumours, have been submitted within this application. However, as no data are available 
for the use of the combination nivo+ipi for the reatment of advanced melanoma in adolescents, 
assessment relies mainly in extrapolation of data from adult patients (results come from study 
CA209067). The extrapolation approach proposed is based on two main principles: that the drug 
behaves similarly and a comparable exposure-response to treatment can be expected between adults 
and adolescents; and that the disease biology can be considered similar between the two populations. 
This is considered acceptable, and the relevance and importance of the favourable and unfavourable 
effects can be extrapolated from adults to adolescents. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
As the extrapolation approach is considered acceptable, a positive benefit-risk balance can also be 
concluded for the relevant treatment of adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The agreed changes to SmPC are intended to reflect the clinical safety and efficacy data for the entire 
paediatric population included in Parts A to D of study CA209070 (N = 97) and pivotal clinical trial for 
this application, covering all the paediatric tumour types (solid and haematological tumours) and not 
limited to melanoma. The extension of indication and posology proposed for adolescents 12 years of 
age and older in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC are mostly based upon extrapolation of data from 
adult patients and modelling and simulation studies, respectively, which is acceptable. Key efficacy 
results are summarized in Sections 4.8 and 5.1, respectively, of the proposed SmPC. Section 5.2 of the 
SmPC was also updated to reflect overall conclusions for the ipi+nivo combination from the modelling 
and simulation and exposure-response studies conducted.

lymphomas. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 38.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plans P/0085/2015 and P/0003/2017 and the results of these studies are 
reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

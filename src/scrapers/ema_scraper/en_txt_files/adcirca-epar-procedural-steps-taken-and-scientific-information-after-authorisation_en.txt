Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), to fulfil Adcirca P46

anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) based on 
the results of observational study NCT00759174 and 
MAH conducted observational study H6D-MC-LVHQ 
(NCT0113110, a category 3 study in the RMP), 
looking at an association between the intermittent 
use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 inhibitors and 
the risk of acute NAION. The RMP (version 8.1) is 
updated accordingly. In addition the Worksharing 
applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to align the 
Package Leaflet with the SmPC of Adcirca and Cialis 
regarding the adverse drug reaction (ADR) ‘priapism’ 
and of Cialis only for the ADR ‘prolonged erection’, to

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and

The European Medicines Agency identified a signal for 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 
the terms haematuria, haematospermia and penile 
haemorrhage at a frequency of uncommon for both 
Cialis and Adcirca. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. This variation was requested by the 
CHMP following a class review of cumulative data on 
urogential bleeding in relation to PDE-5 inhibitors.  
The MAH also took the opportunity to correct a 
typographical error in Annex II of the product 
information of Adcirca. Furthermore, the PI for both 
products is being brought in line with the latest QRD 
II and PL 
penile haemorrhage and haematospermia following the use 
of sildenafil when monitoring the EudraVigilance database. 
After an initial discussion of this signal, the 
Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) requested all 
MAHs of PDE-5 inhibitors to submit a cumulative overview 
of the adverse event (AE) terms penile haemorrhage, 
haematospermia, haematuria and penile hematoma and a 
discussion on background incidence, and possible 
mechanisms, including a possible effect on platelet 
function, time relations, long term outcome, overdose, the 
potential for confounding, and the possibility of a 
pharmacological class effect. After having assessed this 
cumulative review the CHMP concluded that genitourinary 
bleeding events should be considered a class effect shared

Following the review of tadalafil PSUR 15, the CHMP 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC after assessment 
of PSUR 15 to include the term "angioedema" with a 
frequency of “unknown”, and update of section 4.8 to 
include the term "syncope" with a frequency of 
“common” to allign with the Company Core 
Datasheet (CCDS). The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
A minor editorial change has also been made to the 
PL to align with the QRD template. 
C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, 
or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Changes with 
NO new additional data are submitted by the MAH 
required the MAH to include angioedema as a listed 
adverse drug reaction (ADR) in the section 4.8 with a 
frequency of “unknown”. The MAH acknowledged this 
request and has updated the SmPC accordingly. 
Following a review of the Company Core Data Sheet 
(CCDS) which was also submitted with PSUR 15, it was 
identified that the ADR “syncope”, present in the CCDS as a 
result of post-marketing data from Cialis, had inadvertently 
not been included in the Adcirca SmPC. To align the SmPC 
with the CCDS, the MAH added “syncope” to the tabulated 
summary of ADRs in section 4.8 as part of this variation. 
This ADR was included in the SmPC with a frequency of 
“common” to reflect the results of the single pivotal 
placebo-controlled trial (H6D-MC-LVGY).

current PI in line with the new SPC guideline and 
QRD template. 
CHMP requested the MAH to submit a Type II variation to 
update Section 4.4 "Special warnings and precautions for

The Adcirca SPC in this variation was also updated to be in 
line with the new guideline (effective on the 1st May 2010) 
and QRD template version 7.3. Part of this SPC update 
includes revising the tabulated summary of adverse 
reactions present in Section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" in 
order to assign a frequency to the adverse reaction 
classified as "Not Known". As a consequence of the update 
to the SPC, appropriate revisions have been proposed to 
the Adcirca package leaflet.

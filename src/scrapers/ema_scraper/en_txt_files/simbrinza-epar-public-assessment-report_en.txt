2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Brinzolamide was approved in the EU as 10 mg/mL eye drops, suspension on 9 March 2000 via 
the Centralised Procedure as ‘Azopt’. The MAH for Azopt is the same as the applicant for this MAA 
for Simbrinza’.  
Brimonidine  was  first  approved  within  the  EU  in  UK  on  18  March  1997  as  2  mg/mL  eye  drops, 
solution.  
Both  products  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  elevated  intraocular  pressure  in  patients  with 
ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma (as monotherapy in adult patients unresponsive to 
beta-blockers or in patients in whom beta-blockers are contraindicated, or as adjunctive therapy 
to  other  intraocular  pressure  lowering  medications  when  the  target  IOP  is  not  achieved  with  a 
single agent). 
Both the individual mono-components are licensed in the EU with a posology of two times daily, 
whilst in the USA they are licensed with a posology of three times daily (TID) administration.  
This application concerns a fixed combination medicinal product including both brinzolamide and 
brimonidine in the same strengths as approved for the mono-component products. The proposed 
posology with this application was one drop of Simbrinza in the affected eye two times daily, in 
line with the EU posology of the mono-components. 
Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that leads to loss of optic-nerve tissue with an excavation of the 
ophthalmoscopically  visible  optic  nerve  head  and  consequently,  to  a  progressive  loss  of  vision. 
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. 
Glaucoma  is  a  frequent  disease.  Up  to  10%  of  people  over  the  age  of  40  years  have  an  IOP 
above  21  mmHg  (normal  range  10  to  21  mmHg).  Those  who  have  such  high  pressures  but  no 
optic-nerve damage are considered to have ocular hypertension. Elevated IOP is a risk factor for 
its development and reduction of IOP has been demonstrated to protect against further damage 
to  the  optic  nerve.  In  medical  practice,  those  patients  who  have  ocular  hypertension  should  be 
periodically  examined  (optic  nerve,  visual  field)  to  determine  whether  there  is  evidence  of 
progressive  damage  which  would  indicate  the  need  to  start  with  treatment.  However,  in  some 
cases (e.g. additional risk factors for glaucoma) a high IOP may be treated even in the absence 
of optic nerve damage. 
Chronic  pharmacological  therapy  is  required  to  lower  and  control  IOP  and  successfully  control 
glaucoma.  Pharmacological  treatments  are  based  on  the  decrease  of  production  of  aqueous 
humour  produced  by  the  ciliary  body  but  there  is  also  the  possibility  to  increase  its  outflow  by 
means  of  surgery  or  laser.  The  target  pressure  is  that  which  is  thought  to  be  safe  to  the  optic

nerve,  taking  into  account  the  amount  of  optic  damage  and  the  pressure  at  which  the  damage 
occurred, but in principle, it should stay below 21 mmHg. 
The  medical  treatment  of  glaucoma  usually  starts  with  a  topical  beta-blocker  that  permits  a 
sufficient  decline  in  IOP  in  most  cases.  If  necessary  (in  patients  poorly  controlled  on  beta-
blockers  or  when  beta-blockers  are  contra-indicated),  either  other  topical  drugs  can  be  used  or 
other topical or systemic drugs have to be added to the patient’s regimen. Laser procedures or 
filtering surgery are usually performed after failure of medical treatment. 
Given that glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT) can progress and typically worsen with age, 
necessitating  the  use  of  more  than  one  IOP-lowering  treatment  in  many  patients,  and  that  life 
expectancy  of  the  population  is  increasing,  the  potential  public  health  problem  and  demand  for 
alternative treatments is high. Approximately 40% of open-angle glaucoma patients require 2 or 
more  medications  within  5  years  of  diagnosis.  Combination  treatments  would  be  expected  to 
reduce  treatment  burden  and  potentially  improve  patient  adherence  to  treatment  since  more 
than one active treatment is included in a single formulation.  
At  the  time  of  this  application,  all  available  anti-glaucoma  combinations  had  the  beta-blocker 
timolol  as  one  of  the  components.  Among  topical  anti-glaucoma  agents,  beta-blockers  tend  to 
have the greatest number of contra-indications due to a number of undesirable systemic effects. 
Development  of  a  combination  treatment  such  as  Brinzolamide/Briminodine,  should  benefit 
patients and physicians by providing an alternative combination choice for treatment of elevated 
IOP  for  those  patients  who  cannot  use  any  of  the  currently  available  timolol-containing 
combination medicines. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The  finished  product  is  available  as  an  eye  drop  suspension  containing  a  fixed  combination  of 
10mg/ml of brinzolamide and 2 mg/ml of brimonidine as active substances. 
Other  ingredients  are:  carbomer,  sodium  chloride,  mannitol,  propylene  glycol,  tyloxapol,  boric 
acid, benzalkonium chloride, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and water. 
The  medicine  is  available  in  8  ml  round  opaque  low  density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bottles  with  a 
LDPE  dispensing  plug  and  white  polypropylene  screw  cap  (drop-tainer)  containing  5  ml 
suspension as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Two active substances are used in this fixed combination product, brinzolamide and brimonidine. 
Brinzolamide 
Brinzolamide  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder  and  the  solubility  is  pH  dependent  with 
minimal solubility at neutral pH and increased solubility at acid or more basic pH. It presents one 
single  asymmetric  centre  being  the  R-enantiomer  the  active  one.  According  to  the  synthetic 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 9/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
process  described  in  this  application  the  active  substance  is  consistently  obtained  as  the  R-
enantiomer  and  is  routinely  controlled  by  a  chiral  purity  test.  Brinzolamide  produced  by  the 
proposed  active  substance  supplier  is  a  crystalline  form.  Only  one  polymorphic  form  of 
brinzolamide has been observed and described in the literature.  
The chemical name of Brinzolamide is (R)-4-(Ethylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2-(3-methoxypropyl)-2H-
thieno[3,2-e]-1,2-thiazine-6-sulfonamide-1,1-dioxide and has the following structure: 
Figure 1: Chemical structure of Brinzolamide 
There  is  no  monograph  in  the  Ph  Eur  or  national  Pharmacopeia  but  there  is  a  USP  monograph 
available. 
The  chemical  structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  infrared  spectroscopy,  ultraviolet 
spectroscopy,  1H  NMR  spectroscopy,  13C  NMR  spectroscopy,  x-ray  diffraction  and  mass 
spectrometry. The molecular formula of this active substance is confirmed by elemental analysis.  
Manufacture 
The brinzolamide is sourced from two manufacturers, both manufacturers used the same route of 
synthesis.  The active substance is synthesised in four steps using commercially available and 
well defined starting materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. 
The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been 
justified with respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for carry-over into the final active 
substance, their structural complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final 
intermediate and the active substance, respectively.  
Information provided adequately describes the manufacturing including reactions conditions, 
quantities of raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origins and characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, 
solvents and catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance has been also 
discussed. The impurity profile of the active substances for both manufactures is identical. 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 10/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bag and secured with plastic tie or 
elastic band, in a rigid opaque plastic, metal or fibreboard drum. The materials in contact with 
the active substance comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification  
(IR;  chiral  HPLC),  solution  colour  (Ph  Eur),  solution  clarity  (Ph  Eur),  loss  on  dying  (Ph  Eur), 
heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  residue  on  ignition  (Ph  Eur),    impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  residual 
solvents (GC), and microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Full  method  validation  data  was 
also provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. 
The analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The 
impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided  on  5  production  batches  produced  by  one  manufacture  and  8 
production  batches  produced  by  the  second  manufacturer.  All  the  batches  were  manufactured 
according  to  the  proposed  synthetic  route,  and  the  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  active 
ingredient  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly.  All  results  are  within  the  specifications  and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Seven  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  packed  in  the  intended  commercial 
packaging from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: 
under  long  term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  60  months  and  accelerated  (40°C/75%RH)  for  up  6 
months. The active substance used in the primary stability studies was manufactured according 
to the commercial process.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification (IR; chiral HPLC), loss on dying 
(Ph  Eur),  heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  residue  on  impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC)  and  chiral  purity 
(HPLC). 
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  by  exposing  the  active  substance  to  UV  radiation, 
high  temperature,  aqueous  hydrolysis,  acid,  base  and  oxidative  conditions.  Based  on  these 
studies  it  is  observed  that  the  active  substance  is  sensitive  to  oxidation  and  hydrolysis 
conditions. 
Photostability  testing  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch  of  the  active 
substance.  The  results  showed  that  there  are  no  significant  changes  for  any  of  the  evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is stable at controlled room temperature. 
The results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

Brimonidine 
Brimonidine tartrate is light tan powder and soluble in water and slightly soluble in methanol. It 
was  noted  that  the  solubility  in  water  increase  with  the  decrease  of  pH.  The  substance 
brimonidine  is  achiral,  but  the  tartaric  acid  is  used  in  its  L  (+)  form.  The  active  substance  is 
controlled  routinely  by  specific  optical  rotation.  Brimonidine  tartrate  produced  by  the  proposed 
active  substance  supplier  is  a  crystalline  form.  Polymorphism  has  not  been  observed  for  active 
substance. 
The  chemical  name  of  brimonidine  tartrate  is  5-Bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl) 
quinoxalin-6-amine; (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid and has the following structure:

Figure 2: Chemical structure of Brimonidine tartarate 
The  chemical  structure  elucidation  has  been  performed  by  infrared  spectroscopy,  1H  NMR 
spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy. The molecular 
formula of this active substance is confirmed by elemental analysis.  
Manufacture 
The Brimonidine tartrate was planned to be sourced by two independent manufactures that used 
the same route of synthesis. During the evaluation, the applicant decided to withdraw one of the 
manufactures of this active substance for commercial reasons. 
The  active  substance  is  synthesised  in  four  steps  using  commercially  available  and  well  defined 
starting materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. 
The  designation  of  the  starting  materials  for  the  synthesis  of  the  active  substance  has  been 
justified with respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for a carry-over into the final active 
substance,  their  structural  complexity  and  with  respect  to  their  proximity  to  the  final 
intermediate and the drug substance, respectively.  
Information  provided  adequately  describes  the  manufacturing  including  reactions  conditions, 
quantities of raw materials and yields.

Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control 
methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The active substance is packaged in a colourless polyethylene bag with a minimum thickness of 
0.06  mm.  The  bag  is  then  wrapped  in  a  second,  identical  polyethylene  bag  that  is  packed  in  a 
rigid opaque container (HDPE or metal drum). The materials in contact with the active substance 
comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR,  specific 
optical  rotation  and  HPLC),  mp,  pH  of  1%  solution,  loss  on  drying  (Ph  Eur),  residue  on  ignition 
(Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur), clarity of 1% solution, impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual 
ethylenediamine (IC) and microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Full  method  validation  data  was 
also provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. 
The analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. The 
impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch  analysis  data  are  provided  on  seven  production  batches  produced  by  the  proposed 
synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be manufactured 
reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  packed  in  the  intended  commercial 
packaging from the proposed manufacturers were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: 
under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up 5 years  and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months. 
The  active  substance  used  in  the  primary  stability  studies  was  manufactured  according  to  the 
commercial process.  
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  identification  (IR),  solution  pH,  loss  on 
drying, impurities (HPLC) and assay (HPLC). 
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  by  exposing  the  active  substance  to  UV  radiation, 
high  temperature,  aqueous  hydrolysis,  acid,  base  and  oxidative  conditions.  Based  on  these 
studies it is observed that the active substance is sensitive to oxidation.

Photostability  testing  following  ICH  guidelines  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch  of  the  active 
substance.  The  results  showed  that  there  are  no  significant  changes  for  any  of  the  evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is stable at controlled room temperature. 
The results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product  
The pharmaceutical development of this eye drop suspension was based on two other authorised 
ophthalmic  products  containing  brinzolamide  and  brimonidine.  The  concentrations  of  the  active 
substances in Simbrinza (brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate) are the same of the respective 
active substances in the already authorised medicinal products: brinzolamide 10mg/ml eye drops 
suspension (Azopt) and brimonidine tartrate 2 mg/ml eye drops solution. Brinzolamide is present 
in  the  finished  product  as  suspended  particles  due  to  its  low  aqueous  solubility,  whereas 
brimonidine is in solution. It was noted that the particle size is tightly controlled and unchanged 
throughout  the  shelf  life.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  of  excipients  in  this  eye 
drop  suspension  are  similar  to  those  present  in  Azopt  with  the  exception  of  the  addition  of 
propylene  glycol  and  boric  acid  and  the  exclusion  of  EDTA.  The  concentration  of  benzalkonium 
chloride was selected at 0.03 mg/mL (0.003%) which is one-third of the concentration in Azopt 
(0.01%).  This  lower  concentration  of  benzalkonium  chloride  still  provides  an  effective  level  of 
preservation  to  meet  the  Ph.  Eur.  criteria  in  the  presence  of  boric  acid.  It  was  noted  that  the 
selection  of  excipients  was  also  based  on  the  desired  quality  attributes  of  the  finished  product 
such as pH, viscosity, tonicity, redispersibility and settling characteristics have been outlined. The 
pH selected for this formulation was close to neutral (pH 6.5), which is similar to the pH selected 
for brimonidine tartrate 2 mg/ml eye drops solution (pH 6.4). The concentration of carbomer is 
the  same  as  in  Azopt,  in  order  to  achieve  the  formulation  viscosity,  similar  bioavailability  and 
ocular  retention.  Based  on  preliminary  stability  studies  it  was  confirmed  that  there  are  no 
compatibility issues concerning the excipients selected in this particular formulation. 
All  the  excipients  selected  are  pharmacopeia  grade  and  controlled  according  with  their  relevant 
monographs. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. 
The  primary  packaging  is  described  as  stated  in  the  SmPC.  The  material  complies  with  Ph  Eur 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data.  This  container  was  selected  on  the  basis  of  compatibility  and  container-closure  integrity 
studies and is adequate for the intended use of the medicinal product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process selected is based upon the approved manufacturing process for other 
eye drops fixed combination containing brinzolamide and timolol as active substances, approved 
via the Centralised Procedure. The manufacturing process consists of the following five steps: 
1)  Autoclaving and aseptic ball milling of brinzolamide; 
2)  Carbomer/salt preparation and bulk sterilisation; 
3)  Brimonidine compounding and filter sterilisation; 
4)  Final compounding and filling; 
5)  Labelling and packaging. 
The  sterilisation  method  is  a  combination  of  steam  sterilisation,  gamma  sterilisation,  ethylene 
Oxide  sterilisation  during  the  various  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process.  The  sterility  of  the 
finished product is achieved by employing aseptic techniques and sterile filling at the last steps of 
the process.  
Sterility  issues  including  sterilisation  procedures,  and  aseptic  procedures,  critical  steps  and 
holding times are adequately addressed and justified. The residual content of ethylene oxide and 
ethylene chlorohydrin will be below the limits specified in the guideline on limitations to the use 
of ethylene oxide in the manufacture of medicinal products. The milling process and uniformity of 
the  suspension  during  filling  has  been  justified  and  documented.  It  was  noted  that  the  critical 
stages  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated.  The  validation  of  the  manufacturing 
process  has  been  evaluated  on  three  consecutive  production  scale  batches.  The  quality  of  the 
production batches was evaluated through the results of in process testing as well as the results 
of finished product testing. The process validation is supported by batch data on three production 
scale batches. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
identification  (HPLC  and  TLC),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  benzalkonium  chloride 
identification (HPLC), benzalkonium chloride assay (HPLC), boric acid identification (HPIC), boric 
acid  assay  (HPIC),  pH  (Ph  Eur),  osmolality  (Ph  Eur),  appearance  (colour  and  uniformity), 
viscosity (Ph Eur), redispersibility, particle size (Ph Eur), fill volume and sterility test (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of five scale batches of the finished product are provided. The results confirm 
the consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with the 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  five  scale  batches  for  each  5.0  ml  and  2.5  ml  of  finished  product  stored  under 
long term conditions for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, intermediate  conditions for 24 months 
at  25  ºC  /  65%  RH  and  for  up  to  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH

according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples  were  tested  for:    identification  (HPLC  and  TLC),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC), 
benzalkonium  chloride  identification  (HPLC),  benzalkonium  chloride  assay  (HPLC),  boric  acid 
identification  (HPIC),  boric  acid  assay  (HPIC),  pH  (Ph  Eur),  osmolality  (Ph  Eur),  appearance 
(color and uniformity), viscosity (Ph Eur), redispersibility, particle size (Ph Eur), weight change, 
package condition and sterility test (Ph Eur). 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  In  addition  stress  stability  studies  were  performed  on  one  fully 
representative batch under various extreme conditions including heat, light and freeze. The data 
demonstrate  that  the  medicinal  product  is  not  affected  by  light  and  is  not  susceptible  to 
degradation under heat, light and freeze conditions. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided 
with suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated at full scale 
at the proposed manufacturing site and a validation protocol has been presented. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory 
way.

2.3.  Non-Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Brinzolamide is a potent and selective inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase-II. Following topical ocular 
administration,  brinzolamide  inhibited  aqueous  humour  formation  and  reduced  elevated 
intraocular  pressure  (IOP).  The  topical  ocular  application  of  brinzolamide  was  shown  to  dose-
dependently reduce IOP by up to 30% in ocular hypertensive monkeys and pigmented rabbits.   
Brimonidine  tartrate  is  a  potent,  selective  alpha-2  adrenoceptor  agonist.  The  topical  ocular 
application of brimonidine tartrate to cats, rabbits and monkeys reduced IOP and pupil diameter 
in  a  dose-related  manner.  Brimonidine  tartrate  also  reduced  IOP  in  glaucomatous  monkeys.  In 
monkeys,  the  topical  ocular  treatment  with  brimonidine  tartrate  promoted  a  dose-dependent 
reduction in aqueous humour flow without affecting total outflow.  
Non-clinical  primary  pharmacology  studies  with  the  proposed  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine 
10 mg/mL  +  2  mg/mL  eye  drops,  suspension  (Brinz/Brim)  have  not  been  conducted  as  the 
clinical use of the individual components is well established. This is acceptable.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  tranquilised  pigmented  rabbits,  twice  daily  topical  ocular  administration  of  20  mg/mL 
brinzolamide  reduced  IOP  and  slightly  increased  optic  nerve  head  blood  flow.  Brimonidine  was 
shown  to  have  neuroprotective  activity  in  a  variety  of  neuronal  injury  animal  models.  No 
secondary  pharmacology  studies  with  brinzolamide/brominidine  were  submitted.  This  was 
considered to be acceptable.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The  safety  pharmacology  of  brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  has  been  characterised  in  previous 
regulatory  submissions  for  the  Azopt  and  authorised  brimonidine  2  mg/mL  eye  drops,  solution 
products,  respectively,  and  published  literature.  In  mice  and  rats  intravenously  administered 
brinzolamide,  no  biologically  significant  effects  were  observed  except  for  a  small  reduction  in 
gastrointestinal  propulsion  (at  6000  fold  the  proposed  clinical  dose  of  0.005  mg/kg/day)  and 
minor  changes  in  urine  electrolytes  and  blood  gases  (at  ≥200  the  proposed  clinical  dose).  For 
brimonidine, hypotension and bradycardia were observed in monkeys that received topical ocular 
administration of the drug. Sedation, reduction in motor activity, reduced gastrointestinal motility 
and transient hyperglycemia effects were also observed in brimonidine-treated animals. 
In a hERG assay conducted with the brinzolamide/brominidine combination, concentrations of up 
to  3  μg/mL  +1 μg/mL  produced  no  inhibition  of  hERG  tail  current  in  HEK293  cells  stably 
transfected with hERG cDNA.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies conducted with brinzolamide and brimonidine alone or 
in  combination  were  not  reported  by  the  Applicant.  Acceptable  justification  for  the  omission  of 
these studies was provided. Potential interactions of Brinz/Brim with other drugs are included in 
the proposed SmPC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion:    The  range  and  extent  of  the 
pharmacokinetics studies conducted with brinzolamide and brimonidine are acceptable. 
Brinzolamide:  The binding of brinzolamide to carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells and tissues 
was  shown  to  reduce  its  plasma  concentration,  increase  the  half-life  of  the  drug  and  result  in 
non-linear  pharmacokinetics.    These  are  reported  to  be  known  effects  of  sulfonamide  carbonic 
anhydrase  inhibitors.  Protein  binding  of  brinzolamide  was  not  high  in  rat,  monkey  or  human 
plasma  (25,  75  and  60%,  respectively).  Brinzolamide  is  absorbed  into  the  eye  following  topical 
ocular dosing. In rabbit eyes, the highest concentrations were found in the anterior ocular tissues 
of the eye (conjunctiva, cornea, aqueous humour and iris-ciliary body) and at lower levels in the 
posterior  tissues  (retina  and  choroid)  and  the  systemic  circulation.  Distribution  of  drug  into  the 
posterior  tissues  appeared  to  be  derived  from  the  systemic  circulation.  The  half-lives  of 
brinzolamide in ocular tissues were approximately 30 to 50 days.  
The  major  metabolites  of  brinzolamide  were  shown  to  be  N-desethyl  brinzolamide, 
N-desmethoxypropyl  brinzolamide,  O-desmethyl  brinzolamide  and  an  N-propionic  acid 
metabolite.  The CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes are involved in the 
metabolism  of  brinzolamide.  Brinzolamide  and  N-desethyl  brinzolamide  did  not  inhibit  the 
metabolism of the CYP isozymes. 
Low levels of brinzolamide are secreted in milk from lactating rats.  
Brimonidine:    Low  plasma  levels  of  brimonidine  was  detected  in  rabbits  administered  topical 
ocular  eye  drops  of  1.5  mg/mL  brimonidine  tartrate  which  rapidly  declined  with  a  half-life  of  1 
hour.    Brimonidine  was  rapidly  absorbed  into  the  eye  with  a  high  affinity  for  melanin  in 
pigmented tissues such as iris-ciliary body. 
In  vitro  studies  showed  the  metabolism  of  brimonidine  to  be  similar  in  rats,  monkeys  and 
humans.  The major metabolites are generated by hepatic aldehyde oxidases.  The primary route 
of  brimonidine  elimination  is  by  metabolism.  Following  intravenous  administration  to  rats  and 
monkeys, brimonidine was eliminated with half-lives of 0.8 and 3.8 hours, respectively.  
Brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  combined:    In  rabbits  that  received  topical  ocular  doses  of 
Brinz/Brim,  systemic  exposure  to  brinzolamide,  N-desethylbrinzolamide  and  brimonidine  was 
detected.   
Following  the  topical  ocular  administration  of  ophthalmic  formulations  of  brimonidine  and 
brinzolamide alone or in combination, the uptake of both drugs into the aqueous humour, bulbar 
conjunctiva  and  iris-ciliary  body  was  demonstrated  in  F1  pigmented  rabbits.  After  the  ocular 
administration  of  three  brinzolamide/brimonidine  combination  formulations  (up  to  10  mg/mL/  2 
mg/mL), the uptake of brinzolamide into the aqueous humour, bulbar conjunctiva and iris-ciliary 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 18/83 
 
  
  
body  was  similar  to  or  greater  than  that  following  the  administration  of  brinzolamide  alone. 
Following 14 days of twice daily topical ocular administration of Brinz/Brim in rabbits, both drugs 
showed  some  accumulation  in  various  ocular  tissues.  Brinzolamide  exposure  was  higher  for 
brinzolamide  alone  than  for  the  combination  in  the  lens,  aqueous  humour  and  iris-ciliary  body 
and  N-desethylbrinzolamide  was  detected  in  the  choroid.  Brimonidine  AUC0-12  h  was  higher  in 
most ocular matrices following the administration of Brinz/Brim than after brimonidine tartrate 2 
mg/mL  alone.  There  appears  to  be  no  clinical  relevance  of  the  increased  ocular  exposure  of 
brinzolamide  and/or  brimonidine  following  the  administration  of  the  combination  formulations 
compared to the individual components. In the clinical trials conducted, the safety profile of the 
fixed  combination  was  similar  to  that  of  the  individual  components  dosed  as  monotherapy  or 
concomitantly  and  did  not  result  in  additional  risk  to  patients  relative  to  those  known  of  the 
individual components. 
Pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions:    The  metabolism  of  brinzolamide  involves  CYP 
isoenzymes.  The  metabolism  of  brimonidine  involves  hepatic  aldehyde  oxidases.  The  Applicant 
stated  that  due  to  the  different  metabolic  pathways  of  the  individual  components  in  the  fixed 
combination  and  the  lack  of  extensive  plasma  protein  binding,  drug  interactions  between  them 
would  be  unlikely.  In  addition,  the  results  of  a  clinical  pharmacokinetic  study  showed  similar 
systemic  exposure  whether  the  two  drugs  were  administered  in  the  fixed  combination  or 
separately as brinzolamide or brimonidine 2 mg/mL eye drops, solution. However, the results of 
the  14-day  ocular  uptake  and  tissue  study  in  pigmented  rabbits  showed  that  the  uptake  of 
brimonidine  into  the  bulbar  conjunctiva  was  greater  than  that  following  the  administration  of 
brinzolamide. In addition, brimonidine AUC0-12 h was higher in most ocular matrices following the 
administration  of  brinzolamide/brominidine  than  after  brimonidine  tartrate  2  mg/mL  alone. 
Potential interactions of brinzolamide/brominidine with other drugs are outlined in the proposed 
SmPC. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In  a  1-day  topical  ocular  toxicity  study  in  rabbits  that  received  20  mg/mL  brinzolamide,  no 
significant effects were detected. In mice and rats, the oral LD50 of brinzolamide was estimated 
to be between 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. In mice and rats, the intravenous and oral LD50 values of 
brimonidine were 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Brinzolamide: In repeated-dose topical ocular toxicity studies conducted for up to 6 months in 
non-pigmented rabbits and 1 year in monkeys, there was no significant irritation of the eye when 
up  to  40  mg/mL  brinzolamide  was  administered  4 times  daily;  which  exceeded  the  proposed 
clinical concentration and dosing frequency of Brinz/Brim. No systemic effects were observed. A 
steady state whole blood concentration was achieved by 1 week post dose, while plasma levels of 
brinzolamide were below the limits of quantitation.  
In repeated-dose oral toxicity studies, the urinary system was established as the primary site of 
target toxicity, which is consistent with the known effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.  
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 19/83 
 
  
  
Brimonidine: In a 3-month repeated-dose topical ocular toxicity study conducted in pigmented 
rabbits  with  brimonidine  tartrate  1.5  mg/mL  eye  drops,  solution,  the  increased  serum  glucose 
effects  observed  were  not  considered  clinically  relevant  due  to  the  low  systemic  exposure  of 
brimonidine in humans following ocular administration. In other repeated dose studies in several 
species,  the  systemic  administration  of  2.5  mg/kg/day  brimonidine  (>500  fold  higher  than  the 
proposed  clinical  dose)  produced  sedation,  ataxia,  hypoactivity,  ptosis,  decreased  muscle  tone, 
hypotension  and  bradycardia  which  were  considered  to  be  related  to  the  exaggerated 
pharmacology of the compound. 
Brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  combined:    Decreased  IOP  was  observed  in  rabbits  that 
received  the  Brinz/Brim  combination.  The  increased  corneal  thickness  also  observed  was 
considered  to  be  rabbit-specific  and  not  clinically  relevant.  Sedation,  a  known  pharmacological 
effect  of  the  α2-receptor  agonist  class,  was  also  observed  and  occurred  at  13.6  times  the 
estimated  human  systemic  exposure.  Additionally,  some  brimonidine-treated  animals  showed 
decreased food consumption which was considered secondary to sedation. 
Penile erection and urogenital swelling were observed in animals that received brimonidine alone 
or the brinzolamide/brominidine combination. Penile erection resolved by approximately 2 hours 
post dose. These effects are considered related to α2-receptor agonists and not clinically relevant 
since  neither  has  been  reported  in  humans  following  clinical  use  of  brimonidine  alone  or  of  the 
Brinz/Brim combination. 
Increased  serum  glucose  levels  and  resulting  secondary  effects  of  liver  hepatocellular 
cytoplasmic vacuolisation and/or glycogen accumulation and islet cell hyperplasia of the pancreas 
were  also  observed  in  animals  that  received  the  brinzolamide/brominidine  combination.  These 
findings are not considered clinically relevant as there have been no reports of their occurrence 
in humans following topical ocular administration of brimonidine. 
Genotoxicity   
The  genotoxic  potential  of  brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  were  evaluated  in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
studies. Neither substance was considered to be genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
In oral carcinogenicity studies up to 2 years in mice and rats, brinzolamide and brimonidine were 
not shown to be carcinogenic. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Brinzolamide:    In  rats  orally  administered  up  to  18  mg/kg/day  brinzolamide,  there  was  no 
effect  on  male  or  female  fertility.  In  embryofetal  development  (EFD)  studies  in  rats  dosed  18 
mg/kg/day  brinzolamide,  an  increased  incidence  of  unossified  sternebrae  or  hyoid  and  reduced 
ossification  of  the  fetal  skull  was  observed.  In  rabbits  orally  administered  up  to  6 mg/kg/day, 
there were no effects on fetal development. In a peri- and postnatal development study, reduced 
body  weights  were  seen  in  the  F1  pups,  at  the  15  mg/kg/day  dose  level.  These  effects  are  not 
considered clinically relevant following the topical ocular administration of brinzolamide.   
Brimonidine:    In  rats  orally  administered  up  to  0.66  mg/kg/day  brimonidine,  there  was  no 
effect on fertility. Body weight changes were observed in the F0 males and F1 pups from the high 
dose group. However, following weaning no effects were observed in the F1 and F2 generations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 20/83 
 
  
  
No  embryolethal  or  teratogenic  effects  were  observed  in  rats  and  rabbits  dosed  up  to  2.5 
mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day brimonidine, respectively. 
Brinzolamide and brimonidine combined:  In view of the topical ocular toxicity studies with 
the  Brinz/Brim  combination  which  showed  similar  systemic  effects  and  exposures  as  those 
observed  in  studies  with  the  individual  components,  demonstrating  no  synergistic  toxicity  with 
the combination, the Applicant concluded that in compliance with the ICH M3 (R2) guidance, EFD 
studies  with  the  brinzolamide/brominidine  combination  were  not  considered  necessary.  This  is 
acceptable. Section 5.3 of the SmPC is considered adequate. 
An  exemption  from  studies  in  paediatric  patients  was  granted  by  the  EMA  and  therefore,  no 
studies in juvenile animals have been conducted with the proposed combination product. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The  systemic  exposures  of  the  individual  brinzolamide  or  brimonidine  agents  following  ocular 
administration  were  similar  to  those  of  the  fixed  dose  brinzolamide/brominidine  combination 
although studies of different durations were compared. 
Local Tolerance  
Topical ocular doses of brinzolamide/brominidine were well tolerated in rabbits. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity:  Brinzolamide showed no potential to induce contact sensitisation in a guinea pig 
maximisation  assay.  Antigenicity  studies  with  brimonidine  or  brinzolamide/brominidine 
formulations  were  not  performed.  This  was  acceptable,  as  there  is  no  indication  that  these 
compounds would induce sensitisation. 
Immunotoxicity,  dependence,  metabolites:    No  studies  on  immunotoxicity,  dependence 
potential  or  metabolites  were  performed  with  brinzolamide  or  brimonidine  alone  or  with  the 
combination.  This was acceptable, as no related concerns have arisen during their clinical use. 
Impurities:    There  are  no  impurity  issues.  The  proposed  product  is  a  fixed  combination  of 
brinzolamide and brimonidine that are already licensed and the impurities have previously been 
qualified. 
Phototoxicity:    Phototoxicity  studies  with  brinzolamide  were  not  conducted  as  it  does  not 
absorb  ultra  violet  light  between  the  290  to  700  nm  wavelengths.  Phototoxicity  studies  with 
brimonidine  alone  or  combined  with  brinzolamide  are  not  considered  necessary  as  no  concerns 
have arisen during their clinical use. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human  use  [EMEA/CHMP/SWP4447/00  corr  1*],  the  Applicant  provided  an  environmental  risk 
assessment for brinzolamide and brimonidine.

The  log  Kow  for  brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  were  determined  according  to  the  OECD-
recommended  shake-flask  method  (OECD  Guideline  107)  and  a  new  report  generated  (TDOC-
0017525 Version 1.0).  
For  brinzolamide,  the  log  Kow  values  obtained  in  this  study  ranged  from  -0.83  to  -0.81  with  an 
average of -0.82.  
For brimonidine, the log Kow values obtained in this study averaged to 0.42.

combination product Simbrinza is considered unlikely to represent a risk for the environment 
following its prescribed use. 
In  addition,  based  on  the  lower  than  4.5  log  Kow  value  obtained  (0.42)  and  the  PECsurfacewater 
value  (1.4  x  10-3)  which  is  lower  than  action  limit  (0.01  μg/L),  brimonidine  2  mg/mL  in  the 
combination product Simbrinza is considered unlikely to represent a risk for the environment 
following its prescribed use.  
These results indicate that further environmental studies are not required.  
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  assessment  of  the  Simbrinza  (Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  10mg/mL  +  2  mg/mL 
Eye  Drops,  Suspension)  is  mainly  based  upon  the  established  non-clinical  profiles  of  the 
individual  approved  active  drug  substances.  Evaluation  of  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine 
combination  product,  especially  in  relation  to  ocular  safety  and  local  tolerance  has  also  been 
appropriately performed by the Applicant. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  data  presented  is  considered  acceptable  to  support  the  clinical  use  of 
Simbrinza  (Brinzolamide  /Brimonidine  10mg/mL  +  2  mg/mL  Eye  Drops,  Suspension)  for  the 
treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  were  carried  out  in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As mentioned above, the posology approved in the US (thrice a day, TID) is different to the one 
in the EU (twice a day, BID) for both Brinzolamide and Brimonidine. Therefore Simbrinza, fixed 
dose  combination  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine,  was  developed  in  two  separate  clinical 
development  plans  –  BID  programme  and  the  TID  programme.  As  the  proposed  posology  for 
authorisation  in  the  EU  is  twice  a  day  (BID)  dosing,  the  BID  programme  is  relevant  for  this 
report, although the data from the TID programme offers supportive safety data.

Overall (BID + TID programmes), data from seven studies were submitted. The BID programme 
included  three  studies:  a  Phase  1  pharmacokinetic  study  with  BID  and  TID  dosing  (C-10-010) 
and two Phase 3 confirmatory studies with BID dosing (C-10-040 and C-10-041). 
PK study (C-10-010) 
The pharmacokinetic study C-10-010 used an open-label design and enrolled healthy adults. The 
overview of this study is given in the table below.  
It was a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, 13 week, pharmacokinetic study in 142 healthy 
subjects  of  at  least  18  years  of  age.  The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  steady-state 
pharmacokinetics  of  Brimonidine  in  plasma  and  RBC  saturation  of  Brinzolamide  and  N-desethyl 
brinzolamide  following  topical  ocular  administration  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  dosed  TID  or 
BID  to  the  PK  following  administration  of  the  individual  components  (Brinzolamide  or 
Brimonidine) in healthy subjects. 
The  study  was  conducted  in  2  phases,  an  oral  treatment  phase  and  a  topical  ocular  treatment 
phase. The 14 day oral regimen with 1 mg brinzolamide BID allowed saturation of RBC carbonic 
anhydrase to be achieved in a reasonable time frame compared to topical ocular administration 
alone. Subjects were randomized to one of the 6 treatment arms. Subjects in the treatment arms 
1,  2,  4,  and  5  received  14  days  of  oral  brinzolamide  1  mg,  twice  daily  (BID).  Subjects  in  the 
treatment  arms  3  and  6  received  no  medication  from  Day  1  to  Day  14.  From  Day  15,  the 
administered investigational product and control article were as follows:  
Treatment arms 1, 2 and 3 evaluated the fixed dose and the mono-components at the TID dose 
regimen, while the treatment arms 4, 5 and 6 evaluated the BID dose regimen.  
Subjects in treatment arms 1 to 5 were administered eye drops until Day 107, while subjects in 
treatment arm 6 were administered eye drops until Day 21.

Samples for PK measurement of Brinzolamide and N-desethyl Brinzolamide (in treatment arms 1, 
2, 4 and 5) were taken at pre-dose on study day 1, 15, 21 and 107. 
Samples for PK measurement of Brimonidine (in treatment arms 1, 3, 4 and 6) were at pre-dose 
on  study  day  15,  21  and  107  respectively.  In  addition,  serial  plasma  sampling  occurred  post-
dose for PK measurements of Brimonidine on Study Days 21 and 107 at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 
2, 3, 4, 8 hours and 12 hours (treatment arms 1, 4 and 6), respectively.

The results for Cmax and AUC of Briminodine after BID and TID administration of the fixed dose 
combination  when  compared  against  the  mono-components  were  all  comparable  except  for  the 
Day  21  steady  state  systemic  exposure  of  Brimonidine.  Following  BID  administration  of  the 
combination  product  Brinz/Brim  the  systemic  exposure  (0.174)  was  less  than  the  systemic 
exposure of Brimonidine administered alone (0.227) with the upper 90% confidence limit of the 
ratio falling slightly below unity (0.954).  
Conclusion 
The  results  showed 
the  steady-state  systemic  exposure  of  brinzolamide,  N-desethyl 
brinzolamide,  and  brimonidine  following  topical  ocular  administration  of  fixed  combination 
Brinz/Brim dosed three times daily (TID) or two times daily (BID) was not meaningfully different 
compared  to  that  observed  following  topical  ocular  administration  of  the  individual  active 
components, Brinzolamide or Brimonidine alone.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Brinzolamide  is  a  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitor  (CAI).  CAIs  exert  a  direct  antagonist  activity  on 
carbonic anhydrase within the ciliary epithelium, thereby reducing the production of bicarbonate 
ions which are critical for active ion and fluid transport across the ciliary epithelium. Additionally, 
when  given  systemically,  CAIs  also  produce  a  generalized  acidosis,  which  reduces  aqueous 
humour  formation.  In  order  to  lower  IOP  by  sufficiently  decreasing  the  amount  of  aqueous 
humour formed, the enzyme activity in the ciliary epithelium must be inhibited by at least 90%. 
IOP lowering effect has been shown to be in the range of 4 to 5 mm Hg in patients with POAG or 
OHT.  When  dosed  appropriately,  CAI  treatment  can  maintain  IOP  control  throughout  a  24  hour 
period. Brinzolamide is approved for use 3 times daily (TID) in the US, although the IOP-lowering 
efficacy is  only  marginally  better  than  twice  daily  (BID)  dosing,  which is  approved  elsewhere  in 
most of the rest of the world including EU.  
Brimonidine  is  an  alpha  2-adrenergic  agonist,  highly  selective  for  the  alpha  2  receptor, 
specifically developed for glaucoma treatment. Alpha agonists reduce IOP by decreasing aqueous 
humour production. With chronic use they also increase uveoscleral outflow. Brimonidine targets 
the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in the ciliary epithelium, leading to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase 
by  activation  of  GTP-binding  protein.  Inhibiting  adenylyl  cyclase  results  in  a  decrease  in  cAMP 
levels  intracellularly,  ultimately  resulting  in  suppression  of  aqueous  humour  production.  The 
mechanism  of  action  by  which  Brimonidine  increases  uveoscleral  outflow  is  only  poorly 
understood,  but  IOP-lowering  in  the  region  of  4  to  6  mmHg  with  Brimonidine  treatment  is 
commonly reported. 
As  the  mechanism  of  Brimonidine  and  Brinzolamide  differ,  it  can  be  expected  that  the 
combination  would  complement  each  other  and  obtain  a  better  IOP  lowering  effect  than  either 
agent alone.  
No additional pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with the combination.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  proposed  combination  of  Brinz/Brim is  a  novel  fixed  dose  combination  of  two  known active 
substances (Brinzolamide and Brimonidine) which are individually licensed and the clinical utility 
of  which  are  well  established.  The  PK  characteristics  of  Brinzolamide  and  Brimonidine  were 
reviewed  and  accepted  as  adequate  during  the  assessment  of  the  MAAs  of  the  individual 
components.  Therefore,  the  applicant’s  approach  for  this  application  was  to  compare  the 
PK/systemic  exposure  of  both  Brinzolamide  and  Brimonidine  after  administration  as  the 
combination (Brinz/Brim) and the mono-components (Brinz alone and Brim alone).  
The  results  from  both  the  BID  and  TID  dosing  are  relevant  as  they  characterise  the  PK  of  the 
active  substances.  For  the  comparison  of  Brinz/Brim  and  Brinz  alone  (both  after  BID  and  TID 
dosing), it was seen that  
- 
- 
Trough RBC levels of Brinz and N-Desethyl Brinz were broadly comparable 
Trough Plasma levels of Brinz were broadly comparable 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 29/83 
 
  
  
For the comparison of Brinz/Brim and Brim alone it was seen that 
- 
- 
the 90% C.I for Cmax of Brim included unity both after BID and TID dosing - suggesting 
comparability 
the 90% C.I for AUC of Brim included unity only after TID dosing. After BID  dosing the 
90%  CI  for  AUC  ratio  after  Brinz/Brim  compared  to  Brim  alone  was  0.614-0.954  – 
suggesting  either  comparable  exposure  (depending  on  results  of  TID  dosing)  or  lower 
exposure with the combination (based on BID results) 
The PK study shows that generally the PK/systemic exposure of the fixed dose is comparable to 
the  PK/systemic  exposure  of  the  individual  active  constituent,  although  there  are  some 
differences as described above. However, it was agreed that these differences were acceptable, 
as they are not likely to be clinically significant, especially as a clinical study has been conducted 
to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  the  combination of  Brinz/Brim  as  compared  to  Brinz  and  Brim 
administered concomitantly. Additionally, the results of these studies support the inference that 
the  PK  of  both  Brinz  and  Brim  are  not  significantly  affected  when  they  are  administered  as  a 
Brinz/Brim combination.  For a fixed dose combination of two known substances the PK of which 
are well-characterised, the presented PK study results was considered adequate. 
No  new  clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  conducted  with  the  combination  of 
Brinz/Brim.  Brinz  belongs  to  a  well-known  class  of  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  whose 
pharmacodynamic  properties  are  reasonably  well  characterised.  Similarly,  Brim  belongs  to  the 
well-known  class  of  alpha  2-adrenergic  agonists  whose  pharmacodynamic  properties  are  well 
established. The clinical utility and the safety  profiles of these two classes of compounds in the 
treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension are also well established.  
In  clinical  practice,  both  these  products  are  used  concomitantly  in  the  same  patient  and  the 
applicant  has  provided  literature,  discussion  and  evidence  from  previous  medication  history  of 
the patients included in the pivotal studies to support this assertion.  
As  these  products  have  different  mechanisms  of  action,  an  additional  ocular  pressure  lowering 
effect  can  be  anticipated  with  the  combination.  Both  products  are  recommended  for 
administration twice a day.  Therefore, the rationale for the development of this combination of 
Brinz/Brim was adequate.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The results of the comparative PK study between Brinz/Brim, Brinz alone and Brim alone (C-10-
010) is considered adequate and acceptable to support the application, as the PK of Brinz alone 
and  Brim  alone  have  been  characterised  and  evaluated  previously  in  the  authorisation  of  the 
individual products. 
The PK study shows that generally the PK/systemic exposure of the fixed dose is comparable to 
the PK/systemic exposure of the individual products.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Seven clinical trials were submitted in support of this application. Five (C-10-010; C-09-038; C-
10-033; C-10-039 and C-11-002) of which have been conducted in the USA and two studies (C-
10-040 & C-10-041) were conducted across different countries, including many from the EU. Of 
these,  only  three  studies  (C-10-010;  C10-040  and  C-10-041)  are  central  to  the  present 
application of BID dosing regimen.  
As  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  is  a  combination  of  two  well-known  treatments  with  established 
safety  and  efficacy,  the  dossier  did  not  include  the  controlled  trials  that  supported  the 
development  of  the  individual  components  and  consequently  these  are  not  discussed  in  this 
report.  The  clinical  development  of  the  combination  Brinzolamide/Briminodine  had  two  distinct 
parts;  one  part  addressing  the  development  for  the  EU  posology  of  BID  dosing  for  the 
components and the other part covering the US posology of TID dosing for the components.  
The  BID  dosing  development  consisted  of  three  clinical  studies,  including  one  pharmacokinetic 
study (C-10-010) and two Phase 3 studies (C-10-040 and C-10-041). These are the main studies 
supporting this application and discussed in detail in this report. 
The  TID  dosing  development  consisted  of  five  clinical  studies,  including  one  pharmacokinetic 
study  (C-10-010),  one  POC  study  (C-09-038),  one  ocular  comfort  study  (C-11-002),  and  two 
Phase 3 studies (C-10-033 and C-10-039). The results of the proof of concept study and ocular 
comfort study with TID dosing can be extrapolated to the BID dosing as well and are discussed 
under dose-finding and safety, respectively. The two phase 3 studies are discussed briefly below 
under  supportive  studies  for  efficacy  as  the  efficacy  results  are  not  directly  relevant  to  the  BID 
dosing. The safety information from these studies relevant to the BID dosing are discussed under 
the safety section of this report. 
Below is a brief description of the seven studies in this report: 
-  One  pharmacokinetic  study  (C-10-010)  –  which  compared  the  steady  state  PK  of  the 
combination  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  with  that  of  the  individual  components.  This 
study  evaluated  both  the  BID  and  TID  dose  regimens  and  has  been  discussed  above 
under Pharmacokinetics; 
-  One  proof  of  concept  study  (C-09-038)  –  which  compared  the  efficacy  of  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  combination  with  the  mono-components  using  the  TID 
regimen.  However,  it  was  accepted  that  this  study  will  allow  the  proof-of-concept  to  be 
extrapolated to the BID regimen as well;  
- 
Two  main  efficacy  studies  (C-10-040  &  C-10-041),  whereby  C-10-040  aimed  at 
demonstrating the superiority of the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine combination as compared 
to the mono-components, while C-10-041 aimed at demonstrating the non-inferiority of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  combination  as  compared 
to 
the  mono-components 
administered concomitantly. These  studies evaluated the BID regimen and hence are of 
key relevance to this application and discussed under ‘main studies’; 
- 
Two  other  efficacy  studies  (C-10-033  and  C-10-039)  were  similar  to  the  two  main 
efficacy  studies  above  but  evaluated  the  TID  dosing  regimen.  Therefore,  albeit  in  a 
different  dosing  regimen,  they  provide  additional  supportive  information  on  the  efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 31/83 
 
  
  
of the combination. They are discussed briefly under ‘Supportive studies’. These studies 
also provide additional safety information for the combination. 
-  One local tolerability/comfort study (C-11-002), evaluating the TID dose regimen. 
However, its conclusions on tolerability are also applicable to the BID dosing regimen and 
therefore this study is discussed under ‘safety’. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  dose-response  studies  were  conducted  with  the  combination.  The  dose-strength  in  the 
Brinz/Brim  combination  was  the  same  as  the  approved  dose-strengths  of  Brinz  alone  and  Brim 
alone,  respectively.  This  approach  was  supported  by  the  results  of  the  PK  study  and  is  a  direct 
reflection  of  the  way  these  two  drugs  are  used  concomitantly  in  clinical  practice.  A  proof-of-
concept  study  (study  C-09-038)  was  conducted  with  the  combination  of  Brinz/Brim  comparing 
against  Brinz  alone,  Brim  alone  and  Brinz+Brim  administered  concomitantly.  Study  C-09-038 
was  conducted  to  investigate  the  hypothesis  that  the  combination  of  Brinzolamide/Briminodine 
would  be  more  efficacious  than  the  individual  components  and  would  not  be  inferior  to  the  two 
drugs  administered  concomitantly.  This  study  evaluated  the  TID  dose  regimen,  but  it  was 
accepted  that  the  inferences  from  this  study  could  reasonably  be  extrapolated  to  the  BID  dose 
regimen.  
Proof of concept STUDY C-09-038 
This was a randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety  and  IOP-lowering  efficacy  of  the  combination  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  fixed 
combination  ophthalmic  suspension  in  patients  with  open-angle  glaucoma  and/or  ocular 
hypertension  in  comparison  to  the  individual  active  constituents  instilled  either  individually  or 
concomitantly.  
Enrolled patients were randomized to one of four study groups: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine and Vehicle in both eyes 
Brinzolamide and Brimonidine concomitantly administered to both eyes 
Brinzolamide and vehicle in both eyes 
Brimonidine and vehicle in both eyes 
Adult  patients  diagnosed  with  open-angle  glaucoma  and/or  ocular  hypertension  with  mean  IOP 
measurement  in  at  least  one  eye  of  greater  than  or  equal  to  24  mmHg  at  the  8  AM  time  point 
and greater than or equal to 21 mmHg at the 10 AM time point at both eligibility visits prior to 
randomization were eligible. 
Patients instilled their assigned study medications TID for 6 weeks and were evaluated for safety 
and efficacy at fixed times (8 AM, + 2 hrs, + 7 hrs, and + 9 hrs) at Week 2 and Week 6.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  mean  change  in  IOP  from  baseline  to  each  of  the 
assessment time points (8 AM, + 2 hrs, + 7 hrs, and + 9 hrs) at Week 6. 
In this study, 170 patients were enrolled and analysed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 32/83 
 
  
  
Based  on  the  95%  confidence  interval  around  the  mean  differences  at  Week  6,  Brinz/Brim  was 
superior to Brinz at + 2 hrs, + 7 hrs, and + 9 hrs (Table 2-2) and was superior to Brim at both + 
2 hrs and + 7 hrs (Table 2-3).  
Overall, the frequentist analysis generally demonstrated that the combination product is superior 
to each of its active components in regard to the mean IOP change from baseline to Week 6. 
The  mean  IOP  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  6  were  similar  at  all  4  time  points  in  the 
Brinz/Brim, Brinz + Brim groups. Specifically, the differences between study drug groups ranged 
from -0.22 to +0.03 mmHg and the respective 95% credible intervals had upper bounds ranging 
from  0.57  to  0.82  (all  demonstrating  non-inferiority,  given  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  1.5 
mmHg) (Table 2-4).

2.5.2.  Main studies 
There are two main phase 3 clinical studies (C-10-040 and C-10-041) that are supportive of the 
efficacy of the combination with BID dosing. A brief outline of these studies is provided below, 
before describing them in details individually. 
Study design 
Both Phase 3 confirmatory studies (C-10-040 and C-10-041) were double-masked and conducted 
in patients who were diagnosed with ocular hypertension (OHT) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG), 
with or without pseudo-exfoliation or a pigment dispersion component. 
Both C-10-040 and C-10-041 were randomized, double-masked, parallel group, active-controlled 
studies. Both were with BID dosing.  
Objectives  
C-10-040  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  fixed 
combination  to  each  of  its  individual  components  whereas  C-10-041  was  designed  to 
demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  compared  to  the  individual 
components  administered  concomitantly  (Brinzolamide+Brimonidine).  Both  studies  were 
designed in accordance with ICH E9 (Statistical Principle for Clinical Trials, CPMP/ICH/363/96). 
Endpoints 
Primary  efficacy  for  both  studies  was  based  on  mean  diurnal  IOP  change  from  baseline  at  3 
months, with supportive safety and efficacy evaluated through to 6 months. 
Treatments 
Study C-10-040 compared Brinz+Brim, Brinz alone and Brim alone in three parallel groups, while 
Study  C-10-041  compared  Brinz+Brim  with  Brinz  and  Brim  concomitantly  administered  10 
minutes  apart.  In  both  studies  patients  instilled  1  drop  of  their  assigned  study  medications  in 
both eyes BID at 9 AM and 9 PM for 6 months.

Study Participants  
Both C-10-040 and C-10-041 enrolled adult patients aged 18 years and older, including elderly, 
diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension, who in the opinion of 
the  investigator  were  insufficiently  controlled  on  monotherapy  or  were  already  taking  multiple 
IOP-lowering medications.  
The inclusion criteria are summarized below: 
•  Diagnosed  with  open-angle  glaucoma  or  ocular  hypertension,  who  in  the  opinion  of  the 
Investigator, were insufficiently controlled on monotherapy or were already on multiple IOP-
lowering medications (subjects 18 years or older) 
•  Mean IOP measurements in at least 1 eye, the same eye(s), must have been: 
o  ≥ 24 mmHg and ≤ 36 mmHg at the 9 AM time point, and 
o  ≥  21  mmHg  and  ≤  36  mmHg  at  the  11  AM  time  point  at  both  the  Eligibility  1  and 
Eligibility 2 visits following washout of any IOP-lowering medication 
o  Mean IOP must not have been > 36 mmHg in either eye at any time point. 
•  Should have been able to understand and sign an informed consent that had been approved 
by an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
The exclusion criteria are summarized as follows: 
•  Women  of  childbearing  potential  if  pregnant,  test  positive  for  pregnancy  at  Screening  Visit, 
breastfeeding,  or  not  in  agreement  to  use  adequate  birth  control  methods  to  prevent 
pregnancy throughout the study. 
•  Severe central visual field loss. 
•  Best  corrected  visual  acuity  (BCVA)  score  worse  than  55  ETDRS  letters  (20/80  Snellen 
equivalent). 
•  Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease. 
•  Ocular trauma within the preceding 6 months. 
•  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the preceding 3 months. 
•  Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease. 
•  Other ocular pathology. 
• 
Intraocular surgery within the 6 months prior to entry. 
•  Ocular laser surgery within the 3 months prior to entry. 
•  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. 
•  Any other conditions, including severe illness, which would make the subject, in the opinion 
of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study. 
•  Recent use of high-dose (>1 gram daily) salicylate therapy. 
•  Recent,  current,  or  anticipated  treatment  with  any  medication  that  augments  adrenergic 
responses, or precludes use of an alpha-adrenergic agonist. 
•  Concurrent use of glucocorticoid medications administered by any route. 
Following  washout  of  previous  IOP-lowering  medications,  patients  had  to  have  an  IOP  between 
24 and 36 mmHg at 8 AM and between 21 and 36 mmHg at 10 AM on each of 2 eligibility visits. 
The same eye was required to qualify at each time-point. The Eligibility 2 Visit was conducted 3 
to 8 days after the Eligibility 1 Visit. 
In both pivotal studies, randomization was stratified into 2 groups of patients, according to their 
baseline IOP (low: 24 to 27 mmHg, and high: 28 to 36 mmHg). 
In-Study Assessments 
During the treatment phase, visits were performed at Week 2 (i.e. 14 ± 3 day), Week 6 (i.e. 42 
±  3  days),  Month  3  (i.e.  90  days  ±  7  days),  and  Month  6  (i.e.  180  days  ±  7  days)  after  the 
second Eligibility Visit.

For  C-10-040  IOP  measurements  were  taken  once  at  screening  and  at  3  time  points  during  all 
other  post-screening  visits  at  9AM,  11  AM  (+2  h)  and  4PM  (+7h).  Patients  at  selected 
investigational centres underwent additional IOP measurements at 7 PM (+ 10 h) as well. 
For  C-10-041,  IOP  measurements  were  taken  once  at  screening  and  2  times  at  all  other  post-
screening visits: at 9 AM and 11 AM (+2 h). 
In each study, the baseline IOP measurement for each eye and time point was estimated as the 
mean IOP obtained during each of the 2 eligibility visits. 
The safety assessments included adverse events, pachymetry, automated perimetry, pulse/blood 
pressure,  fundus  parameters  (vitreous,  retina/macula/choroid  and  optic  nerve),  best-corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) and slit-lamp examination (cornea, iris/anterior chamber, lens, eyelids and 
conjunctiva).

Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  analysis  set  included  all  patients  who  received  study  drug  and 
completed  at  least  one  scheduled  on-therapy  study  visit.  The  per  protocol  (PP)  analysis  set 
included  all  patients  who  satisfied  pre-randomization  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  received  study 
drug, and completed at least one scheduled on-therapy study visit. In addition, individual patient 
visits and data points that did not satisfy the protocol criteria may have been excluded from the 
PP analysis set. The ITT analysis set provided primary inference for the primary and supportive 
efficacy  analyses,  while  the  PP  analysis  set  was  considered  supportive.  The  safety  analysis  set 
included  all  patients  who  received  study  drug.  Evaluability  for  inclusion  of  patients  (and  where 
applicable, individual study visits) in the ITT, PP, and safety analysis sets was determined prior 
to locking the database and breaking the code for the masked study drug. 
One  eye  from  each  patient  was  chosen  as  the  study  eye  and  only  data  for  the  study  eye  were 
used for the efficacy analyses. In cases where a patient dosed only 1 eye during the study, the 
dosed  eye was selected as the study eye. If both eyes were dosed during the study, the worse 
evaluable  eye  was  selected  as  the  study  eye.  The  worse  eye  was  defined  as  the  eye  with  the 
higher  IOP  at  9  AM  averaged  across  the  2  eligibility  visits.  If  both  eyes  had  equal  IOP 
measurements  at  the  specified  time  point,  then  the  worse  eye  was  defined as  the  eye  with  the 
higher  IOP  at  11  AM  averaged  across  the  2  eligibility  visits.  If  both  eyes  had  equal  IOP 
measurements at the specified time point, then the right eye was selected for analysis. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  superiority  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  to  each  of  its  individual  active  components 
(Brinzolamide and Brimonidine) with respect to treatment group differences in the mean diurnal 
IOP change from baseline was determined using pairwise tests at each on-therapy study visit.  
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 36/83 
 
  
  
In  addition,  the  mean  diurnal  IOP  change  from  baseline  was  summarized  using  descriptive 
statistics for each on-therapy visit up to Month 3 (Week 2, Week 6, Month 3) and at Month 6 (the 
IOP assessments were collected at this visit for patient safety). Similarly, descriptive statistics by 
visit  were  also  presented  for  the  diurnal  IOP  change  from  baseline  using  IOP  change 
measurements averaged over the assessment time points at 9 AM, + 2 h, + 7 h, and + 10 h in 
those  investigational  centres  that  were  selected  to  perform  an  assessment  of  IOP  at  +10  h  (of 
note, the +10 h collection time point was not performed at Week 2). 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  analysed  on  an  observed-case  basis.  For  this  analysis,  the 
statistical  model  and  associated  analyses  used  were  robust  for  data  missing  at  random.  A 
sensitivity analysis was performed in which the last observation carried forward (LOCF)  method 
was  used  to  impute  values  for  dropouts  and  for  missing  IOP  values  at  Month  3.  If  a  patient 
missed a visit, the most recently measured IOP for the same time of day was used to impute the 
IOP at the missed Month 3 visit. Similarly, if a patient was discontinued from the study, the last 
IOP measurement for each time of day was carried forward to replace the IOP measurements for 
the Month 3 visit. Treatment group differences in mean IOP were determined using pairwise, 2-
sample t-tests for each time point at the Month 3 visit. 
Supportive Efficacy Endpoints 
Pairwise  tests  were  performed  using  the  least  squares  means  derived  from  a  statistical  model 
that accounted for correlated IOP measurements within patient where investigational centre and 
actual  baseline  9  AM  IOP  stratum  were  included  in  the  model.  Differences  between  treatment 
groups  in  the  percentage  of  patients  with  IOP  measurements  less  than  18  mmHg  at  each  on-
therapy study visit were investigated across strata (investigational centre and 9 AM baseline IOP 
category)  using  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test.  The  IOP  values,  the  absolute  and  percent 
changes in IOP values from baseline, and the percentage of patients with IOP values less than 18 
mmHg were summarized using descriptive statistics at each on-therapy visit and time point.

including  193 
in

discontinued  early  from  the  study  17.1%);  this  percentage  was  greater  than  the  percentage  of 
patients in the Brinzolamide group who discontinued early from the study (7.3%).

The  most  commonly  reported  reason  for  discontinuation  was  an  adverse  event  (AE).  This  was 
highest  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  arm  (11.9%)  followed  by  the  Brimonidine  (8.6%)  and 
Brinzolamide  (0.5%)  groups.  The  second  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  was 
inadequate  control  of  IOP,  which  was  highest  in  the  Brimonidine  arm  and  lowest  with  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine combination.

Baseline data 
The  patients  were  primarily  65  years  of  age  and  older  (54.0%),  female  (55.3%),  and  White 
(70.5%).  The  majority  of  patients  also  had  brown  eyes  (60.3%)  and  a  diagnosis  of  open-angle 
glaucoma  (75.3%).  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  observed  between  study  drug 
groups  in  regard  to  any  demographic  parameter.  The  mean  diurnal  IOP  at  baseline  was  similar 
for  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (25.9  mmHg),  Brinzolamide  (25.9  mmHg),  and  Brimonidine 
(26.0  mmHg)  groups.  The  mean  baseline  IOP  measurements  in  all  3  study  drug  groups  were 
similar at each of the 3 assessment time points (approximately 27 mmHg at 9 AM, approximately 
26 mmHg at 11 AM, and approximately 25 mmHg at 4 PM).; no important differences were noted 
in the mean baseline IOP measurements (average of Eligibility 1 and 2 visits for each time point) 
among the study drug groups at any of the assessment time points. Within the ITT analysis set 
most patients (70.1%) had a baseline IOP within the 24 to 27 mmHg stratum.  
The mean corneal thickness at  baseline was approximately 0.55 mm in each study  drug group. 
No  meaningful  differences  in  baseline  corneal  thickness  measurements  were  observed  between 
study  drug  groups  or  between  the  ITT  and  PP  analysis  sets.  More  than  90%  of  the  patients  in 
each study drug group had corneal thickness measurements of 0.60 mm or less.  
The  base-line  IOP  lowering  medications  prior  to  study  entry  were  comparable  across  treatment 
groups and were consistent with choice of IOP lowering agents in clinical practice.

Outcomes and estimation 
PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
The  mean  diurnal  IOP  reduction  from  baseline  at  Month  3  was  greater  for  patients  in  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  group  (7.9  mmHg)  than  for  patients  in  the  Brinzolamide  (6.5  mmHg) 
and  the  differences  in  mean  diurnal  IOP  change  from  baseline  significantly  favoured 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  relative  to  Brinzolamide  (-1.4  mmHg;  p  <  0.0001)  as  shown  in  the 
table below.

table below.  
Primary analysis (not true ITT): 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  the  applicant  also  submitted  4  types  of  analyses  for  handling  the 
missing data, starting with minimal imputation and ending with conservative methods to address 
the  plausible  sources  of  bias.  For  all  the  described  sensitivity  analyses,  regardless  of  how  they 
handled missing data, results remained consistent with those from the original primary analyses, 
thus confirming the conclusions of superiority.

mean  differences  between  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  group  and  each  of  its  active 
components at these study visits ranged from -1.1 to -1.6 mmHg. 
• 
The percentages of patients with an IOP measurement less than 18 mmHg were greater 
in the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine group than in the Brinzolamide group at eleven of twelve 
assessments  through  Month  6  and  were  greater  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  group 
than in the Brimonidine group at all twelve assessments through to Month 6. 
For  the  supportive  endpoint  of  achievement  of  IOP  <  18  mmHg,  counting  missing  data  as 
failures, i.e. IOP ≥ 18 mmHg, had no substantial impact on the overall conclusions.

combination as compared to both the components administered concomitantly.  
Methods

Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  analysis  set  included  all  patients  who  received  study  drug  and 
completed  at  least  one  scheduled  on-therapy  study  visit.  The  per  protocol  (PP)  analysis  set 
included  all  patients  who  satisfied  pre-randomization  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  received  study 
drug, and completed at least one scheduled on-therapy study visit. In addition, individual patient 
visits and data points that did not satisfy the protocol criteria could have been excluded from the 
PP  analysis  set.  The  PP  analysis  set  provided  primary  inference  for  the  primary  and  supportive 
efficacy  analyses,  while  the  ITT  analysis  set  was  considered  supportive.  The  safety  analysis  set 
included  all  patients  who  received  study  drug.  Evaluability  for  inclusion  of  patients  (and  where 
applicable, individual study visits) in the ITT, PP, and safety analysis sets was determined prior 
to locking the database and breaking the code for masked study drug. 
One eye from each patient was chosen as the study eye, as described above for study C-10-040. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean diurnal IOP change  from baseline at Month  3. The 
mean diurnal IOP change from baseline at Month 3 was calculated as the average of the available 
IOP  changes  from  baseline  across  time  points  (9  AM,  +  2  h)  at  Month  3.  For  the  test  of  non-
inferiority,  95%  2-sided  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  constructed  for  the  differences  in  the 
mean diurnal IOP change from baseline between study drug groups at each visit and time point. 
The  non-inferiority  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  relative  to  Brinzolamide+Brimonidine  was 
assessed through an examination of the CIs for the Month 3 visit; the non-inferiority margin was 
+ 1.5 mmHg. 
Treatment  group  differences  in  mean  diurnal  IOP  change  from  baseline  were  determined  using 
pairwise tests at each on-therapy visit. The pairwise test was based on the least squares means 
derived from a statistical model that accounted for  correlated IOP measurements within patient 
where investigational centre and actual baseline 9 AM IOP stratum were included in the model.

Baseline data 
Within  the  PP  analysis  set,  slight  majorities  of  the  patients  were  female  (56.1%)  and  aged  65 
years  and  older  (51.1%;  overall  mean  age  =  63.3  years).  The  patients  were  primarily  White 
(64.6%),  had  brown  eyes  (66.1%),  and  presented  with  a  diagnosis  of  open-angle  glaucoma 
(75.9%).  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  observed  between  study  drug  groups  in 
regard  to  any  demographic  parameter.  The  mean  diurnal  IOP  at  baseline  was  similar  for 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (26.4  mmHg)  and  Brinzolamide+Brimonidine  (26.5  mmHg)  groups. 
The mean baseline IOP measurements across both time points (9 AM and 11 AM) and study drug 
groups  ranged  from  25.8  to  27.0  mmHg.  The  largest  mean  IOP  measurement  was  observed  in 
both study drug groups at the 9 AM time point. No important differences were noted in the mean 
baseline  IOP  measurements  (average  of  Eligibility  Visit  1  and  Eligibility  Visit  2  for  each  time 
point) among the study drug groups at either of the assessment time points. 
The mean corneal thickness at  baseline was approximately 0.55 mm in each study  drug group. 
No  meaningful  differences  in  baseline  corneal  thickness  measurements  were  observed  between 
study drug groups. 
The  base-line  IOP  lowering  medications  prior  to  study  entry  were  comparable  across  treatment 
groups and were consistent with choice of IOP lowering agents in clinical practice.

Primary Endpoint 
At  Month  3,  the  mean  diurnal  IOP  reduction  from  baseline  was  similar  for  patients  in  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  and  Brinzolamide+Brimonidine  groups  (8.5  mmHg  and  8.3  mmHg, 
respectively). The treatment group difference was -0.1 mmHg with an upper bound of the 95% 
CI equal to 0.2 mmHg, which is below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg.

For  the  primary  endpoint,  the  applicant  also  submitted  4  types  of  analyses  for  handling  the 
missing data, starting with minimal imputation and ending with conservative methods to address 
the  plausible  sources  of  bias.  For  all  the  described  sensitivity  analyses,  regardless  of  how  they 
handled missing data, results remained consistent with those from the original primary analyses, 
thus confirming the conclusions of non-inferiority. 
Supportive Endpoints 
- 
The  mean  diurnal  IOP  reductions  from  baseline  at  Week  2,  Week  6,  and  Month  6  were 
similar  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  and  Brinzolamide+Brimonidine  groups  (Figure 
2.5.4–4). The magnitude of the maximum observed mean difference between treatment 
groups was 0.1 mmHg.

The percentages of patients with an IOP measurement less than 18 mmHg were similar 
across  study  visits 
for 
the  same 
time  point 
through  Month  6 
in 
the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine and Brinzolamide+Brimonidine groups. 
For  the  supportive  endpoint  of  achievement  of  IOP  <  18  mmHg,  counting  missing  data  as 
failures, i.e. IOP ≥ 18 mmHg, had no substantial effect on overall conclusions. 
•  By definition, numerators remained the same while denominators increased, resulting in 
reduced percentages of patients having IOP < 18 mmHg at each visit and time point. 
•  As with the original analysis without imputation, percentages with IOP < 18 mmHg were 
similar for Brinzolamide/Brimonidine and Brinzolamide+Brimonidine at all visits and time 
points

in  sample  sizes  across  subgroups,  definitive  conclusions  regarding  the  impact  of  the  subgroups 
cannot be made. In general, greater efficacy was observed for Brinzolamide/Brimonidine relative 
to  Brinzolamide  and  Brimonidine  within  each  subgroup  category  and  the  magnitude  of  the  IOP 
lowering  effect  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  relative  to  Brinzolamide  and  Brimonidine  was 
generally similar in each subgroup. 
In  both  pivotal  studies,  randomization  was  stratified  into  patients  with  IOP  of  24-27  mm  Hg  at 
baseline  and  patients  with  IOP  of  28-36  mm  Hg  at  baseline.  The  objective  was  to  balance  the 
distribution of severity of raised in IOP in the treatment arms. The studies were not powered to 
deduce  the  comparative  efficacy  of  Brinz/Brim  in  these  two  strata,  though  descriptive  statistics 
have been provided.  
From this data, it is seen that the superiority of Brinz/Brim over the monotherapies and the non-
inferiority of Brinz/Brim as compared to Brinz+Brim is seen in both strata.

STUDY C-10-033 
This  was  a 
three-month  efficacy  and  safety  study  of 
the 
fixed  combination  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine compared to the individual components all dosed three times a day in 
patients  with  open-angle  glaucoma  and  ocular  hypertension.  This  study  used  the  TID  dosing 
regimen. This study had a treatment duration of 3 months and was designed to demonstrate the 
superiority of the combination over the mono-components.  
This  was  a  randomized,  double-masked,  parallel-group,  active-controlled  study.  Adult  patients 
with  open-angle  glaucoma  or  hypertension  with  mean  IOP  measurements  in  at  least  one  eye 
(and the same eye) greater than or equal to 24 mmHg and less than or equal to 36 mmHg at the 
8 AM time point in both Eligibility Visits, and greater than or equal to 21 mmHg and less than or 
equal to 36 mmHg at the 10 AM time point in both eligibility visits were eligible. Eligible patients 
were randomized to one of three study drug groups.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  applicant  submitted  two  pivotal  efficacy  studies  in  support  of  the  efficacy  of  the  fixed  dose 
combination of Brinz/Brim in open-angle glaucoma/ocular hypertension. As both Brinz and Brim 
are established in the treatment of OAG/OHT, the approach taken by the applicant was to show 
that  the  efficacy  of  Brinz/Brim  was  superior  to  Brinz  alone  and  Brim  alone (study  C-10-040)  as 
well  as  to  show  that  Brinz/Brim  is  non-inferior  to  Brinz  +  Brim    (study  C-10-041)  administered 
concomitantly 10 minutes apart.  
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 55/83 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both  studies  were  randomized,  double-masked,  multi-centre,  active  controlled  studies.  The 
active control (Brinz alone, Brim alone and Brinz +Brim administered concomitantly 10 minutes 
apart) are authorised in the treatment of OAG/OHT and the efficacy sizes of these medicines are 
well established. The study designs are appropriate for the study objectives.  
The dose-strength in the Brinz/Brim combination was the same as the approved dose-strengths 
of Brinz alone and Brim alone, respectively. This approach was supported by the results of the PK 
study  and  is  a  direct  reflection  of  the  way  the  two  active  ingredients  are  used  concomitantly in 
clinical practice. 
Both  studies  were  conducted  in  patients  with  OAG/OHT  who  were  inadequately  controlled  on 
mono-therapy  or  who  were  already  on  two  or  more  medications  for  their  glaucoma.  The  study 
population is appropriate.  
Both studies were of 6-month treatment duration and investigated the BID dosing regimen (the 
posology  approved  for  Brinz  alone  and  Brim  alone  in  the  EU).  The  primary  endpoint  was  the 
difference in mean diurnal change in IOP from baseline between the treatment arms at month 3 
assessment.  The  applicant  had  sought  CHMP  Scientific  Advice  and  had  based  the  primary 
endpoint on the advice given. The secondary endpoints were appropriate.  
The efficacy assessments were planned at pre-dose (9AM), +2 hrs, +7hrs in study C-10-040 and 
at 9AM and +2hrs in study C-10-041. These time-points adequately cover the anticipated trough 
effect and peak effect of treatment on IOP.  
Both  studies  were  multi-centre  studies  including  study  centres  in  Europe.  The  applicant  stated 
that  both  the  studies  have  been  conducted  in  accordance  to  ICH-GCP  standards  and  was 
compliant  to  all  relevant  regulations.  The  amendments  and  protocol  deviations  were  small  in 
number  and  were  not  considered  to  be  major  to  significantly  impact  on  the  conclusions  of  the 
studies. 
The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  analysis  set  included  all  patients  who  received  study  drug  and 
completed  at  least  one  scheduled  on-therapy  study  visit.  The  per  protocol  (PP)  analysis  set 
included  all  patients  who  satisfied  pre-randomization  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  received  study 
drug, and completed at least one scheduled on-therapy study visit. The PP analysis set provided 
primary  inference  for  the  primary  and  supportive  efficacy  analyses,  while  the  ITT  analysis  set 
was considered supportive. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
- Study C-10-040 was designed to demonstrate that the IOP lowering efficacy of Brinz/Brim was 
superior  to  both  Brinz  alone  and  Brim  alone.  In  this  study  the  primary  endpoint  was  assessed 
after  treatment  duration  of  3  months  with  Brinz/Brim  (n=176),  Brinz  alone  (n=182)  or  Brim 
alone  (n=161)  in  parallel  groups.  At  the  end  of  3  months  treatment,  the  mean  diurnal  IOP 
reduction  from  baseline  in  the  Brinz/Brim,  Brinz  alone  or  Brim  alone  groups  were  7.9mm  Hg, 
6.5mm Hg and 6.4 mm Hg respectively. The difference between Brinz/Brim and Brinz alone was 
-1.4  mm  Hg  and  the  difference  between  Brinz/Brim  and  Brim  alone  was  -1.5mm  Hg.  These 
differences were statistically significant (p<0.00001 for both comparisons). For all the described 
sensitivity  analyses,  regardless  of  how  they  handled  missing  data,  results  remained  consistent 
with those from the original primary analyses, thus confirming the conclusions of superiority.

The  secondary  endpoint  of  mean  diurnal  IOP  reduction  from  baseline  at  other  visits  (week  2,  6 
and  month  6)  were  greater  (statistically  significant)  in  the  Brinz/Brim  group  as  compared  to 
either  Brinz alone  or  Brim  alone  for each  pair  wise  comparison.  The  mean  differences  for  these 
comparisons ranged from -1.1 to -1.6. 
The other secondary endpoints of mean IOP change from baseline and mean percent IOP change 
from  baseline  at  each  time-point  and  study  visit  were  greater  (statistically  significant)  in  the 
Brinz/Brim group as compared to Brinz alone and Brim alone for each pair-wise comparison.  
The  percentages  of  patients  with  an  IOP  measurement  less  than  18  mmHg  were  greater  in  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine group than in the Brinzolamide group at 11 of 12 assessments through 
Month 6. The percentages of patients with an IOP measurement less than 18 mmHg were greater 
in the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine group than in the Brimonidine alone group at all 12 assessments 
through  to  Month  6.  The  study  was  not,  however,  powered  to  demonstrate  superiority  for  this 
endpoint. 
The  percentages  of  patients  with  an  IOP  measurement  less  than  18  mmHg  per  were  greater  in 
the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  group  than  in  the  Brimonidine  alone  group  at  all  12  assessments 
through to Month 6. 
-  Study  C-10-041  was  designed  to  demonstrate  that  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  Brinz/Brim 
was not inferior to Brinz+Brim added concomitantly 10 minutes apart. In this study, the primary 
endpoint  was  assessed  after  treatment  duration  of  3  months  with  Brinz/Brim  (n=384)  and 
Brinz+Brin  (n=373)  in  parallel  groups.  At  the  end  of  the  3  months,  the  mean  diurnal  IOP 
reduction from baseline in the Brinz/Brim and Brinz+Brim arms were -8.5 and -8.3 respectively. 
The mean difference between treatment groups was -0.1 and the 95% C.I was (-0.5, 0.2). These 
results  were  from  the  per-protocol  population.  For  all  the  described  sensitivity  analyses, 
regardless  of  how  they  handled  missing  data,  results  remained  consistent  with  those  from  the 
original  primary  analyses,  thus  confirming  the  conclusions  of  non-inferiority.  The  secondary 
endpoints of mean diurnal IOP reduction from other visits (week 2, 6 and month 6) were similar 
in both the Brinz/Brim and the Brinz+Brim groups. The maximum difference was ±0.1 between 
both groups.  
The other secondary endpoints of mean IOP measurements at each time point (9AM and 9AM+2 
hrs) at each study visit were similar in both treatment groups (max mean difference was 0.2 mm 
Hg) as were the percentage of patients with an IOP measurement less than 18 mm Hg.  
The results of the primary and secondary endpoints from this study support the conclusion that 
Brinz/Brim  is  not  inferior  in  the  IOP-lowering  efficacy  as  compared  to  Brinz+Brim  administered 
concomitantly 10 minutes apart.  
In  both  studies,  consistency  of  IOP-lowering  efficacy  by  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  was  evident 
beginning  at  Week  2  (the  first  on-therapy  visit)  and  appeared  to  be  generally  maintained 
throughout the 6-month study duration.  
From the discussion presented by the applicant, it is seen that the IOP lowering efficacy reported 
for  prostaglandin  analogues  and  beta  blockers  are  approximately  6  to  10  mm  Hg  and  mean 
percent  IOP  reduction  between  23  to  37%.  Across  both  studies,  the  mean  IOP  reduction  for 
Brinz/Brim was shown to be in a smilar range with mean values of 8 mm Hg and mean percent 
IOP reduction is between 23 to 37%.

-  In  addition  to  the  above  two  main  studies,  there  is  efficacy  data  from  the  proof-of-concept 
study which evaluated the TID dosing regimen but nevertheless the results were along the same 
lines and hence supportive.  
-  Furthermore,  supportive  evidence  is  provided  by  two  larger  studies  (used  as  pivotal  for  US 
registration)  which  evaluated,  however,  the  TID  dosing  regimen.  Both  these  studies  compared 
Brinz/Brim over Brinz alone and Brim alone. The endpoint for these studies was the mean IOP at 
the  end  of  three  months  of  treatment  in  each  of  the  treatment  arms.  These  studies  also 
concluded that Brinz/brim was superior to Brinz alone and Brim alone.  
Overall,  the  results  from  the  supportive  studies  do  not  raise  any  concern/queries  regarding  the 
conclusions drawn from the pivotal efficacy studies for this MAA. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  superior  IOP  reducing  efficacy  of  the  combination  of  Brinz/Brim  over  Brim  alone  and  Brinz 
alone was conclusively demonstrated. The non-inferiority in the IOP reducing efficacy of the fixed 
dose  combination  Brinz/Brim  as  compared  to  the  concomitant  administration  of  Brinz  +Brim, 
each administered 10 minutes apart was conclusively demonstrated. The conclusions drawn from 
the  primary  endpoint  are  fully  supported  by  the  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  in  both 
pivotal  studies.  Other  clinical  studies  (with  the  TID  dosing  regimen)  also  provide  supportive 
evidence of efficacy. Therefore, it was accepted that adequate evidence of efficacy was provided 
in support of the fixed dose combination of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine administered BID. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  summary  of  clinical  safety  reported  below  includes  data  from  four  phase  3  studies,  which 
constitute  the  instrumental  contribution  to  the  safety  database  in  defining  the  safety  profile  of 
the combination of Brinzolamide/Briminodine: 
- 
- 
two studies (C-10-040 and C-10-041) of 6 months duration that evaluated the BID dose 
and exposed 645 patients; 
two studies (C-10-033 and C-10-039), one of 3 month duration and the other of 6 month 
duration both evaluating the TID dose regimen and exposed 435 patients.  
The methods and design of these studies have been described in section 2.5.2. 
In  addition,  there  was  a  specific  descriptive  comfort  study  in  101  patients  with  treatment 
duration of 1 week that provides information on the safety of the combination (study C-11-002). 
This study and its results are discussed below.  
It is pertinent to point out that the individual active components of the fixed combination at the 
same  concentration  as  in  Simbrinza  were  marketed  at  the  time  of  this  MAA.  This  provides 
supportive  safety  information  and  the  applicant  presented  the  adverse  event  listing  of  both 
Brimonidine alone and Brinzolonamide alone in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.

Patient exposure 
The  phase  3  development  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (BID  and  TID)  included  1080  patients 
exposed to Brinzolamide/Brimonidine (BID or TID) during its development.  
On  the  whole,  1080  patients  (645  in  BID  studies  and  435  in  TID  studies)  were  exposed  to  the 
fixed  dose  combination  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  and  TID.  The  majority  of  patients  (about 
80%) were exposed to Brinz/Brim BID at least 173 days, thus making the data supportive from a 
safety point of view.  
Patients  in  the  safety  and  efficacy  clinical  trials  C-10-040  and  C-10-041  received  one  drop  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine, Brinzolamide + Brimonidine, Brinzolamide, or Brimonidine BID in both 
eyes for up to 6 months. Table 2.7.4.1–4 summarizes pooled exposure data for clinical trials C-
10-040 and C-10-041. 
In  general,  patients  included  in  the  study  were  representative  of  the  population  that  would  be 
expected  to  receive  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID.  In  addition,  treatment  groups  were  well 
balanced with respect to demographic characteristics. 
Adverse events 
The majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported during the studies were related to local 
ocular side effects (i.e. ADRs coding to the System Organ Classification [SOC] of Eye Disorders) 
with a known causal association with one or more of the individual components.  
The  most  common  ocular  ADRs  reported  during  the  studies  were  for  hyperaemia  of  the  eye 
(reported  as  ocular  or  conjunctival  hyperaemia),  ocular  allergic  type  reactions,  visual 
disturbances  (i.e.  blurred  vision,  visual  acuity  reduced,  visual  impairment,  and  hypermetropia), 
and ocular discomfort (i.e. eye irritation, eye pain, eye pruritus, foreign body sensation in eyes, 
ocular  discomfort,  and  conjunctival  irritation).  Common  systemic  ADRs  reported  included 
dysgeusia,  oral  dryness  (i.e.  dry  mouth,  dry  throat,  mucosal  dryness,  and  nasal  dryness)  and 
fatigue/drowsiness (i.e. asthenia, fatigue, hypotonia, sedation, hypersomnia, and somnolence).

Hyperaemia  of  the  eye  (ocular  hyperaemia  and  conjunctival  hyperaemia)  was  reported  at  a 
higher incidence in the Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID and Brimonidine BID groups relative to 
the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID and Brinzolamide BID (lowest incidence) groups. 
Adverse  drug  reactions  for  visual  disturbances  (vision  blurred,  visual  acuity  reduced, 
hypermetropia and visual impairment) were reported at a numerically slightly higher incidence in 
the  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  group  relative  to  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  group. 
Visual disturbances were reported at a higher incidence in the Brinzolamide/ Brimonidine BID and 
Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  groups  relative  to  BID  dosing  with  either  of  the  individual 
components.  
Adverse drug reactions for visual acuity reduced and visual impairment were only reported in the 
Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID group. 
Hypermetropia  was  reported  in  a  single  patient  dosed  with  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID.  The 
applicant argued that the likelihood that the occurrence of hypermetropia is associated with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014

use of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID is remote, as no signal supporting a causal association the 
development  of  hypermetropia  has  been  identified  from  clinical  trials,  post-marketing 
surveillance, or peer-reviewed literature articles with Brinz alone or Brim alone. 
Ocular discomfort (Eye pain, Eye pruritus, Eye irritation, Foreign body sensation in eyes, ocular 
discomfort  and  conjunctival 
irritation)  was  reported  at  a  higher 
incidence 
in 
the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  and  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  groups  relative  to  the 
individual  components.  Between  the  fixed  combination  and  concomitant  dosing  more  ocular 
discomfort was reported in the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID group 
Ocular allergic reactions 
Table 2.7.4.2–9 presents the frequency and incidence of these events reported in clinical trials C-
10-041 and C-10-040. A review of these data revealed no clinically relevant difference between 
the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID and Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID treatment groups in the 
number  of  patients  who  experienced  an  ocular  allergic  reaction  over  a  6  month  period.  When 
compared to the individual components for the same time period, the incidence of patients with 
ocular  allergic  reactions  was  slightly  higher  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  group  versus 
the  Brimonidine  BID  group.  No  ocular  allergic  reactions  were  reported  in  the  Brinzolamide  BID 
group.  The  rate  of  discontinuations  due  to  an  ocular  allergic  reaction  was  similar  among  the 
brimonidine containing study medications. 
Reactions of the corneal surface 
Regarding adverse drug reactions of the corneal surface, the incidence of punctate keratitis and 
keratitis was slightly higher in the Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID group relative to the other 3 
Assessment report

treatment  groups  and  similar  between  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  and  Brimonidine  BID 
groups. The lowest incidence was reported in the Brinzolamide BID group. 
Systemic adverse reactions 
Dysgeusia  was  reported  at  a  similar  incidence  between  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  and 
Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  groups.  A  lower  incidence  of  dysgeusia  was  reported  in  the 
individual  components  relative  to  the  fixed  combination  or  the  individual  components  dosed 
concomitantly BID 
A  higher  incidence  of  oral  dryness  was  reported  in the  Brimonidine  BID  group  relative  to either 
the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  or  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  groups.  Between  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID and Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID groups the incidence of oral 
dryness was similar. The lowest incidence of oral dryness was reported in the Brinzolamide BID 
group (Table 2.7.4.2–5).

Patients  who  dosed  with  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  experienced  a  higher  incidence  of 
fatigue/drowsiness relative to the other 3 treatment groups. The incidence of fatigue/ drowsiness 
was similar between the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID and Brimonidine BID groups. The lowest 
incidence of fatigue/drowsiness was reported in the Brinzolamide BID group (Table 2.7.4.2–6). 
Decreased  blood  pressure  (i.e.  hypotension  and  blood  pressure  decreased)  was  reported  at  a 
higher incidence in the Brimonidine BID group relative to the other 3 treatment groups. Between 
the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  and  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  groups  the  incidence  of 
decreased  blood  pressure  was  slightly  higher  in  the  fixed  combination.  No  patient  treated  with 
Brinzolamide BID reported an ADR for a decrease in blood pressure. 
The applicant stated that the pooled safety data for Brinz/Brim from the two pivotal study were 
consistent with those reported with use of Brinz alone and Brim alone BID.

Safety data from TID dosing C-10-033 and C-10-039 
A review ADRs through 3 months of dosing revealed that the majority were for local ocular side 
effects (e.g. blurred vision, ocular allergic reactions, ocular inflammation, and ocular discomfort) 
with  a  known  causal  association  with  the  individual  components.  The  most  prevalent  preferred 
term (PT) reported during the studies was blurred vision. Other common ocular ADRs reported at 
an  incidence  of  ≥  1%  were  for  the  development  of  ocular  allergies,  ocular  inflammation,  and 
ocular  discomfort.  Common  systemic  ADRs  reported  included  dysgeusia,  dry  mouth,  and 
fatigue/drowsiness (including the PT terms of asthenia, fatigue, lethargy and somnolence).  
A review of ADRs reported at an incidence of ≥ 1% through the Month 6 time point revealed that 
the common adverse events were similar to the month 3 time point. No increase in the incidence 
of ADRs reported for blurred vision was observed between the Month 3 and Month 6 time points. 
Small incremental increases in ADRs reported for ocular inflammation and ocular discomfort were 
observed between the Month 3 and Month 6 time points in the treatment groups. In addition, an 
incremental increase in the number of ADRs reported for an ocular allergic reaction was observed 
between the Month 3 and Month 6 time points.  
The  incidence  of  dry  mouth  and  fatigue/drowsiness  was  similar,  with  no  meaningful  difference 
between the 2 groups in the incidence at the Month 3 and Month 6 time points. 
The  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  after  TID  administration  of  Brim/Brinz  was  compared 
against that of Brim alone and Brinz alone. A review of these data revealed that the majority of 
treatment-emergent AEs reported during the study (up to Month 3 and up to Month 6) were for 
local  ocular  side  effects  or  systemic  effects  associated  with  the  formulations  and/or  the 
pharmaceutical class of the study medications. No increased ocular or systemic risk with the use 
of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  relative  to  the  individual  components  dosed  TID  was  identified 
at the Month 3 interim time point or with an additional 3 months of dosing based upon a review 
of treatment emergent adverse events. 
The  applicant  presented  and  discussed  the  comparison  of  the  safety  profiles  between  the  BID 
and  TID  dosing  as  well  as  the  comparison  of  the  safety  profiles between  the  first  three  months 
and the last three months of the 6 month dosing studies. 
It  was  observed  that  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  is  higher  with  TID  dosing  as 
compared  to  the  BID  dosing  when  the  6  month  treatment  duration  studies  are  compared.  This 
was  expected,  based  on  the  higher  daily  dose  administered  in  these  studies.  This  higher 
incidence with TID dosing is also observed with the specific adverse events of vision blurred and 
eye allergies.  
Regarding  ocular  allergy  reactions,  these  events  are  already  known  ADR  due  to  Brimonidine. 
According  to  the  literature  provided  by  the  Company  in  relation  to  ocular  allergy  reactions 
induced  by  brimonidine,  it  seems  that  these  reactions  do  not  decrease  over  time  with  the 
administration of brimonidine.  
Comparison  of  the  ADRs  between  the  first  3  months  and  the  last  3  months  showed  that  local 
ADRs  of  ocular  discomfort  were  higher  in  the  first  three  months.  However,  the  incidence  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 64/83 
 
  
  
 
allergic  reactions  was  similar  in  both  periods,  which  showed  that  the  risk  of  developing  ocular 
allergic reaction does not decrease over time. 
Given that open-angle  glaucoma is a  chronic condition, ocular allergy reactions cannot  be ruled 
out  during  Brinz/Brim  BID  treatment.  These  reactions  are  already  considered  in  the  RMP  as 
important identified risks. Taking into account the chronic nature of the disease, an appropriate 
monitoring of this risk is relevant in order to characterise this occurrence during long-term use. 
Additionally,  a  warning  regarding  the  discontinuation  of  treatment  if  ocular  allergic  reactions 
occur is reflected under section 4.4 of SmPC, which was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Onset of adverse events across studies 
A  review  of  adverse  events  by  onset  day  revealed  that  the  majority  of  local-ocular  side  effects 
reported  for  blurred  vision  and  ocular  discomfort  occurred  within  the  first  2  weeks  of  use  with 
study medication. The majority of ocular allergic type reactions occurred after 30 days or more of 
dosing,  specifically  within  patients  exposed  to  the  brimonidine  containing  study  medications. 
Common  systemic  side-effects  (e.g.  dry  mouth,  fatigue/drowsiness)  were  generally  reported 
within the first 30 days of dosing while dysgeusia was generally reported within the first 2 weeks 
of dosing. 
Overall, no clinically relevant treatment group differences were identified for the onset of adverse 
events. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No  treatment-related  fatal  AEs  were  reported  during  the  clinical  development  of  Brinzolamide/ 
Brimonidine (BID or TID). One patient who dosed with Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID suffered 
a fatal myocardial infarction during clinical trial C-10-041. The event was assessed as unrelated 
to the use of Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID. 
Table 2.7.4.2–28 presents the frequency and incidence of patients with SAEs reported in clinical 
trials C-10-040 and C-10-041.

The  two  cases  of  related  serious  adverse  reactions  were  the  report  of  development  of  corneal 
erosion  under  the  category  of  an  ‘other  important  medical  event’  in  2  patients  dosed  with  the 
combination in the C-10-041 trial. In both cases, corneal erosion was reported as a finding and 
treatment  was  continued,  however  at  a  later  visit  there  was  a  upgrading  in  the  severity  of  the 
corneal  erosion  resulting  in  them  being  classified  as  serious  adverse  reactions.  Both  cases,  the 
corneal  erosion  resolved  with  the  use  of  concomitant  medications  upon  exiting  from  the  study. 
The  event  of  corneal  erosion  is  listed  in  the  labelling  of  both  the  individual  components  and 
analysis and comparison of results across the TID studies did not show an increased incidence of 
these events with the combination. 
All other serious adverse events were considered unrelated to the study drug. 
While  a  higher  number  of  patients  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  group  reported  an  SAE 
relative to either BID dosing of the individual components as monotherapy or concomitantly, no 
patterns  emerged  that  would  suggest  an  issue  concerning  patient  safety  when  dosing  with  the 
fixed combination of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID based on a thorough review of the types and 
characteristics of SAEs reported, coupled with an evaluation of overall patient characteristics 
Table  2.7.4.2–30  presents  the  frequency  and  incidence  of  patients  with  SAEs  reported  in  the 
studies C-10-033 and C-10-039 
One serious adverse drug reaction (SAR) was reported for chest pain in a patient who dosed with 
Brinzolamide  TID  in  clinical  trial  C-10-033.  The  patient  discontinued  participation  in  the  study 
due to the chest pain. All other SAEs reported in the clinical studies were assessed as unrelated 
to the use of study medication by the study Investigator. 
No  patterns  emerged  that  would  suggest  an  issue  concerning  patient  safety  when  dosing  with 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  or  either  of  the  individual  components  dosed  TID  based  on  a 
thorough review of the types and characteristics of SAEs reported, coupled with an evaluation of 
overall patient characteristics. 
Laboratory findings 
No  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  in  the  phase  3  clinical  trials  for 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID or TID (C-10-041, C-10-040, C-10-039 or C-10-033).

  Physical and ocular examination findings 
Based  on  a  review  of  changes  from  baseline  in  safety  assessments  of  vital  signs  and  physical 
findings  no  additional  safety  concerns  were  identified  for  the  use  of  the  fixed  combination 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (dosed  BID  or  TID)  relative  to  the  known  risks  of  the  individual 
components  (dosed  BID  or  TID)  or  in  comparison  to  the  concomitant  use  of  the  individual 
components (dosed BID or TID). A summary of findings on the physical findings are as below: 
•  No clinically meaningful decrease in pulse rate or blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) was 
observed with the use of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine (BID or TID). 
o  A trend towards a slight decrease in pulse rate was observed during the course of the 
study  in  patients  who  dosed  with  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (BID  or  TID).  The 
magnitude  of  the  decrease  in  pulse  rate  was  similar  between  the  treatment  groups 
containing  an  α2-adrenergic  agonist  (Brinzolamide/Brimonidine,  Brinzolamide  + 
Brimonidine, and Brimonidine). 
o  A trend towards a slight decrease in blood pressure was observed during the course 
of  these  studies  in  patients  who  dosed  with  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (BID  or  TID). 
The magnitude of the decrease in blood pressure was similar between the treatment 
groups containing an α2-adrenergic agonist (Brinzolamide/Brimonidine, Brinzolamide 
+ Brimonidine, and Brimonidine).  
o 
It  was  noted  that  several  patients  in  Brinz/Brim  BID  group  versus  unfixed 
combination,  brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  groups  experienced  a  shift  from  normal 
to  high  diastolic  blood  pressure  (8.5%  versus  6.5%,  4.1%  and  6.9%,  respectively. 
Section 4.8 of SmPC includes ‘hypertension’ as a very rare adverse event induced by 
brimonidine.  This  was  thought  sufficient  to  adequately  inform  health  professionals 
and patients on the possible occurrence of this adverse event. 
•  No  trend  toward  a  decrease  in  visual acuity  was  observed  over  the  course  of  the  studies  in 
any treatment group.  
• 
The most common slit-lamp exam finding was a change from baseline in the assessment of 
eyelids/conjunctiva. 
o  The majority of these changes were associated with known local ocular effects (e.g. 
ocular  hyperaemia  and  ocular  allergic  type  reactions)  of  the  individual  components, 
particularly  brimonidine,  and  do  not  represent  a  previously  unknown  risk  or  an 
exacerbation of the known risks relative to the individual components. 
o  A  higher  incidence  of  changes  from  baseline  in  eyelids/conjunctiva  was  observed  in 
patients  who  dosed  with  study  medications  containing  brimonidine  relative  to 
patients who received Brinzolamide only. The incidence was higher in patients dosing 
TID  with  brimonidine  containing  study  medications  relative  to  those  patients  who 
dosed BID with brimonidine containing study medications for up to 6 months. 
•  No clinically relevant treatment group differences were observed for changes in iris/anterior 
chamber.

Brimonidine/Brinzolamide  TID  (C-10-039)  for  up  to  6  months  experienced  the  highest 
incidence  of  changes  from  baseline  in  cornea  (5.1%  and  6.8%,  respectively)  among  the  4 
treatment groups. 
o  A  review  of  the  changes  in  cornea  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  group 
revealed  that  the  majority  of  changes  (9  of  the  15  changes)  were  either  not 
considered  adverse  events  or  assessed  as  not 
related 
to 
the  use  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  (e.g.  corneal  abrasion,  ocular  foreign  body)  by  the 
study Investigator. Similar to the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine TID group the majority of 
changes in cornea (5 of the 9 changes) reported in the Brinzolamide TID group were 
either  not  considered  adverse  events  or  assessed  as  not  related  to  the  use  of 
Brinzolamide TID (e.g. corneal abrasion) by the study Investigator. In contrast, all 6 
changes in cornea reported in the Brimonidine TID group were assessed as related to 
the use of the study medication.

o  Corneal  erosion  is  a  known  adverse  event  of  the  individual  components  and  the 
administration  of  the  fixed  combination  does  not  seem  to  increase  the  incidence  of 
this  event.  In  addition,  this  event  is  already  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important 
potential  risk.  Concerning  data  provided  related  to  corneal  deposits,  no  firm 
conclusions  can  be  drawn.  According  to  RMP  requirements,  post  marketing 
surveillance will help to clarify the nature of these corneal deposits, the causality with 
the fixed combination and the potential incidence with long-term use. 
o  Overall, a review of corneal changes over the course of the study did not reveal any 
meaningful  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  that  would  indicate  a 
previously unknown risk.

treatment groups. 
o  A  review  of  lenticular  changes  from  baseline  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID

Safety in special populations 
There are no specific studies in special populations.  
Based on a review of adverse events by intrinsic factors no additional risks in any of the intrinsic 
subpopulations were identified for the fixed combination of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine relative to 
dosing  with  the  individual  components  as  monotherapy  or  concomitantly.  The  intrinsic  factors 
Assessment report

reviewed  include  age,  gender,  race,  concomitant  disease,  concomitant  medications,  iris  colour 
and time of onset. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. No drug interactions were reported in 
any of the clinical trials involving Brinzolamide/Brimonidine (BID or TID).  
Data from clinical trial C-10-010 did not indicate a drug-drug interaction between the individual 
active components in Brinzolamide/ Brimonidine (BID or TID). 
In  the  main  efficacy  studies,  patients  were  allowed  the  use  of  concomitant  medications  not 
specifically  prohibited  by  the  protocols  over  the  course  of  the  clinical  studies.  Exposure  to 
concomitant  medications  could  be  present  at  baseline  and  continuing  after  exposure  to  study 
medication or the concomitant medication may have been initiated during trial participation. The 
overall  frequency  and  incidence  of  adverse  events  for  patients  on  concomitant  medication 
categories were reviewed based on the concomitant medication.  
The primary focus of the review by concomitant medication categories was to assess whether the 
adverse  event  profile  was  altered  in  those  patients  with  a  specific  concomitant  medication 
category  when  compared  to  the  other  treatment  groups  within  the  subpopulation.  This  review 
would also determine if the specific subpopulation behaved differently than the overall population 
of patients participating in clinical studies C-10-040 and C-10-041. 
A review of adverse events in patients with exposure to Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID revealed 
no additional risks in each of the subpopulations categorized by concomitant medication relative 
to the individual components.  
The applicant discussed the potential for drug interactions with Brinz/Brim with some classes of 
drugs  which  include  oral  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  (potential  additive  effect),  high-dose 
salicylate  therapy  (rare  case  of  acid-base  alterations  reported  with  other  carbonic  anhydrase 
inhibitors  but  not  Brinz),  CNS  depressants  (potential  additive/potentiating  effect  with  Brim), 
antihypertensives  (potential  adrenergic  interactions),  tricyclic  antidepressants  (potentially  may 
blunt  the  effect  of  adrenergic  agonists)  and  MAO-  inhibitors  (theoretical  interference  with 
metabolism of brimonidine). 
Appropriate  warnings  and  contra-indications  are  included  in  the  SmPC  to  inform  about  the 
consequences of these interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events

in clinical studies C-10-040 and C-10-041 due to an AE.

A higher incidence of patients in the Brinzoalmide/Brimonidine BID and Brinzolamide +  
Brimonidine  BID  group  discontinued  study  participation  due  to  an  AE  relative  to  the  individual 
components. The majority of AEs leading to patient discontinuation from study participation were 
for  the  types  of  local  ocular  events  that  have  been  associated  with  the  use  of  the  individual 
components  (e.g.  ocular  discomfort,  ocular  hyperaemia,  and  ocular  allergies).  The  incidence  of 
patients  discontinuing  due  to  these  events  was  similar  between  the  fixed  combination  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID and concomitant dosing with Brinzolamide + Brimonidine BID with 
the exception of ocular hyperaemia where a higher incidence of discontinuations were observed 
in  the  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID  group  relative  to  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID 
group. 
The incidence of patients discontinuing due to an ocular allergic type reaction was similar among 
the  3  treatment  groups  containing  brimonidine  (Table  2.5.5–6).  One  patient  treated  with 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID discontinued study participation due to a SAR. 
Table 2.7.4.2–34 presents the frequency and incidence of patients who discontinued participation

More patients in the brimonidine containing groups discontinued participation in the clinical study 
due  to  an  adverse  event  relative  to  the  Brinzolamide  TID  group.  Between  the  brimonidine 
containing  groups  a  greater  number  of  patients  in  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  group 
discontinued study participation due to an AE versus the Brimonidine TID group. More patients in 
the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine TID group discontinued study participation due to an AE associated 
with  an  ocular  allergic  reaction  versus  the  Brimonidine  TID  group.  The  individual  characteristics 
of  the  ocular  allergic  reactions  did  not  reveal  an  untoward  difference  between  the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  and  Brimonidine  TID  groups  that  would  pose  a  greater  risk  to 
patients using the fixed combination. 
Table 2.7.4.2–35 presents the frequency and incidence of patients who discontinued participation 
in clinical study C-10-039 due to an AE through the Month 6 time point. 
The  majority  of  AEs  leading  to  patient  discontinuation  were  for  the  types  of  events  that  have 
been  associated  with  the  use  of  the  individual  components  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID.  A 
comparison  between  the  fixed  combination  and  Brimonidine  TID  group  (the  groups  with  the 
highest  incidence  of  patients  who  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event)  did  not  reveal  an 
appreciable  difference  between  the  groups  in  relation  to  the  types  of  AEs  leading  to  patient 
discontinuation with the exception of ocular allergic reactions.

During  the  first  3  months  of  the  study  a  greater  number  of  patients  in  the  fixed  combination 
group  discontinued  study  participation  due  to  an  ocular  allergic  reaction  compared  to  the 
Brimonidine  TID  group.  However,  during  the  additional  3  months  of  dosing  the  incidence  of 
patients discontinuing study participation due to an ocular allergic reaction was similar between 
the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  TID  and  Brimonidine  TID  treatment  groups.  During  the  first  3 
months  of  the  study  a  greater  number  of  patients  in  the  fixed  combination  group  discontinued 
study  participation  due  to  an  ocular  allergic  reaction  compared  to  the  Brimonidine  TID  group. 
However, during the additional 3 months of dosing the incidence of patients discontinuing study 
participation due to an ocular allergic reaction was similar between the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine 
TID and Brimonidine TID treatment groups.  
The  applicant  presented  a  comparison  of  the  withdrawal  rates  due  to  ocular  allergies  with  both 
the BID and TID dosing. It is observed that there is a much higher incidence of withdrawal due to 
ocular  allergies  with  the  TID  regimens  for  both  Brim  alone  and  Brinz/Brim  as  compared  to  the 
BID regimen. This is consistent with the expectation of higher incidence due to larger daily dose 
and is consistent with the observation from other ADRs. 
Post-marketing experience 
The  fixed  combination  product  Brinzolamide  10  mg/ml  /  Brimonidine  2  mg/ml  Ophthalmic 
Suspension  received  approval  in  the  US  on  19  April  2013.  No  post-marketing  data  is  currently 
available.  However,  the  individual  components  are  currently  marketed  and  data  from  post-
marketing experience involving each of these products will be briefly described below.  
Brinzolamide 10mg/ml was first authorised in 1998.  
Brimonidine 2mg/ml was first authorised in 2002.  
The  safety  data  emerging  from  the  clinical  trials  submitted  in  support  of  this  MAA  for  the  two 
above  products  is  in  concordance  with  the  previous  post-marketing  cumulative  experience.  The 
Applicant submitted the last 3 PSURs for both products at the time of the application. The risk-
benefit profile of both these products continue to be considered positive as per the conclusions of 
the PSURs. 
STUDY C-11-002 
This was a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, active controlled descriptive study. Adult 
subjects 18 years of age with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were eligible. 
The  primary  comfort  endpoint  was  the  mean  ocular  discomfort  score  on  a  5-point  ocular 
discomfort  scale  evaluated 
immediately  after 
instillation  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine, 
Brinzolamide,  or  Brimonidine  at  Week  1  (Visit  2).  The  ocular  discomfort  scale  consisted  of  the 
following  ratings:  0  (none),  1  (mild),  2  (moderate),  3  (severe),  and  4  (very  severe).  The 
supportive  comfort  endpoint  was  the  percentage  of  patients  in  each  ocular  discomfort  score 
category. 
Overall  101  patients  were  enrolled  and  formed  the  ITT  population.  The  mean  ocular  discomfort 
immediately after instillation of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine (0.8) was higher than the mean ocular 
discomfort of its components, Brinzolamide (0.4) and Brimonidine (0.3) 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 73/83 
 
  
  
The  percentage  of  patients  who  experienced  no  or  mild  ocular  discomfort  immediately  after 
instillation was lower in the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine treatment group (78.8%) compared to the  
Brinzolamide (94.1%) and Brimonidine (97%) treatment groups. 
To put the results in context, the applicant described two other ocular comfort studies in patients 
with  OAG  and  OHT,  comparing  2  timolol-containing  combination  products,  Brinzolamide 
1%/Timolol  0.5%  Ophthalmic  Suspension  (Azarga)  and  Dorzolamide  2%/Timolol  0.5% 
Ophthalmic Solution. The mean discomfort score at Week 1 for patients dosed with Azarga was 
0.77  and  for  patients  dosed  with  Dorzolamide  2%/Timolol  0.5%  Ophthalmic  Solution  was  1.53. 
This  discomfort  scale  was  the  same  as  the  one  used  in  the  current  study.  Both  Azarga  and 
Dorzolamide 2%/Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, are found in ophthalmic practice to be well 
tolerated  by  glaucoma  patients.  Therefore,  a  score  of  0.8  for  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  in  the 
present study demonstrates an acceptable comfort level by comparison. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  analysis  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  is  mainly  focused  on  the  safety  data 
obtained from the pivotal clinical studies (C-10-040 and C-10-041, BID dosing) and USA phase 3 
clinical  studies  (C-10-033  and  C-10-039,  TID  dosing).  In  addition,  an  ocular  comfort  study 
performed  in  the  USA,  and  the  SmPCs  of  individual  components  were  also  evaluated.  This 
approach for the safety assessment was acceptable.  
Both  the  mono-components  of  Brinz/Brim  were  authorised  at  the  time  of  this  report  and  have 
been in clinical use for a considerable period of time. Consequently their safety profiles are well-
established.  Both  Brinz  and  Brim  are  used  concomitantly  in  clinical  practice  and  this  provides 
additional  reassurance,  although  no  robust  literature  reporting  on  the  use  of  the  specific 
combination was available at the time of this report.  
In this context, the overall patient exposure of 1080 patients in the pivotal efficacy studies from 
both  the  BID  and  TID  studies  was  considered  an  adequate  safety  database  in  support  of  this 
application.  A total of 535 patients (82.9%) were exposed to Brinz/Brim BID beyond 3 months, 
and the majority of them (about 80%) were exposed to Brinz/Brim for at least 173 days.   
Given the set of exclusion criteria described above for the phase III clinical trials, the safety data 
from  the  excluded  groups  are  not  available.  However,  this  was  considered  acceptable,  as  the 
SmPC  for  Sibmrinza  lists  the  pre-cautions  and  warnings  at  the  time  of  this  report  that  are 
present in both the mono-therapies. 
In the BID studies, the most common adverse reactions were generally ocular (topical) reactions 
including  ocular  hyperaemia,  ocular  discomfort,  visual  disturbances  and  ocular  allergy.  The 
topical adverse reaction profiles were comparable across the combination treatments and mono-
therapies,  except  that  Brinzolamide  showed  generally  fewer  topical  adverse  reactions  as 
compared to the Brimonidine containing treatments. There was an increased incidence of topical 
reactions  of  ocular  discomfort,  visual  disturbances  and  ocular  allergies  in  the  fixed  dose 
combination  Brinz/Brim  as  compared  to  the  mono-therapies,  while  the  incidence  seemed 
comparable  to  the  Brinz+Brim  treatment  arm.  Overall,  incidences  of  hyperaemia  of  the  eye, 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 74/83 
 
  
  
 
visual  disturbances,  punctuate  keratitis,  keratitis  ocular  discomfort,  dysgeusia,  oral  dryness, 
fatigue/drowsiness  were  reported  in  a  numerically  slightly  higher  incidence  in  the  Brinz+Brim 
arm. Adverse reactions of corneal erosion, corneal deposit, hypermetropia and drug allergy were 
reported  in  very  small  numbers  in  the  Brinzolamide/  Brimonidine  BID  group  but  not  in  the 
Brinz+Brim  group.  Corneal  erosion  is  a  known  risk  of  the  mono-components  and  the  reported 
incidences for Brinz/Brim in these studies are consistent with the established risk for the mono-
components.  
Of  the  topical  events,  ocular  allergies  appear  to  have  resulted  in  a  substantial  number  of 
treatment  discontinuations  and  hence  this  was  considered  a  significant  safety  event.  The 
withdrawals  due  to  Brinz/Brim  (3.9%)  and  Brim  alone  (3.4%)  due  to  allergies  appeared  to  be 
comparable  
Dysgeusia, dry mouth and fatigue/drowsiness were the most common systemic events reported 
in  these  studies  and  the  incidence  of  dry  mouth  and  fatigue  were  more  common  with  the 
Brimonidine containing treatment arms.  
The  safety  profile  in  the  TID  studies  was  qualitatively  similar  to  the  one  derived  from  the  BID 
studies.  However,  there  appeared  to  be  differences  in  the  incidence  rates  of  certain  events 
between the BID and TID studies. It was generally seen that the incidences of ADRs were higher 
in the TDI dosing regimen as compared to the BID dosing regimen. This was consistent with the 
higher  daily  dose  administered  in  this  group.  The  withdrawal  rates  due  to  ocular  allergies  also 
showed  a  similar  higher  incidence  in  the  TID  dosing  regimen.  The  risk  of  occurrence  of  ocular 
allergies did not decrease over time as seen by similar rates of occurrence in the first and second 
three-month  period.  There  was  an  increase  in  incidence  of  allergies  for  the  combination  with 
increased  treatment  duration  as  seen  from  the  3  months  vs  6  months  comparison  in  the  TID 
studies. This was also seen for Brimonidine alone.  
The results of physical examination data did not generally give cause for concern. Regarding vital 
signs, the fixed dose combination did not seem to  increase the  incidence of  pulse rate or blood 
pressure  decreased  in  comparison  to  the  other  treatment  groups.  However,  several  patients  in 
Brinz/Brim  BID  group  versus  unfixed  combination,  brinzolamide  and  brimonidine  groups 
experienced a shift from normal to high diastolic blood pressure (8.5% versus 6.5%, 4.1% and 
6.9%,  respectively).  The  SmPC  includes  hypertension  as  a  very  rare  adverse  event  of 
brimonidine.  This  was  considered  adequate  to  mitigate  the  potential  small  risk  of  increasing 
blood pressure. A warning on hypotension is also included in the SmPC. 
The  overall  discontinuation  rate  in  the  BID  studies  for  Brinz/Brim,  Brinz+Brim  and  Brim  alone 
were 11%, 13.3% and 8.6%, respectively. The majority of these were due to ADRs (e.g. ocular 
discomfort,  ocular  hyperaemia,  and  ocular  allergies).  Brinz  alone  had  very  low  discontinuation 
rates.  In  the  TID  studies,  the  overall  discontinuation  rates  for  Brinz/Brim  and  Brim  alone  were 
14.4% and 11.9% (at 3 month interval) and 19% and 16.2% respectively at 6 months.   
Data either from clinical studies or published data on concomitant clinical use was not available. 
However, it was agreed that this can be addressed in the post-marketing phase. The proposal of 
the  applicant  to  include  long-term  safety  as  missing  information  in  the  RMP  and  to  monitor  for 
this risk by routine pharmacovigilance measures was considered acceptable by the PRAC, as the 
long-term safety of the mono-components is well-established.

There is potential for drug interactions with Brinz/Brim with some classes of drugs, including oral 
carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  (potential  additive  effect),  high-dose  salicylate  therapy  (rare  case 
of  acid-base  alterations  reported  with  other  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors  but  not  Brinz),  CNS 
depressants  (potential  additive/potentiating  effect  with  Brim),  antihypertensives  (potential 
adrenergic interactions), tricyclic antidepressants (potentially may blunt the effect of adrenergic 
agonists)  and  MAO-  inhibitors  (theoretical  interference  with  metabolism  of  brimonidine). 
Appropriate  warnings  and  contra-indications  are  included  in  the  SmPC  to  inform  about  the 
consequences of these interactions. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  Brinz/Brim  was  adequately  characterised  in  the  pivotal  studies.  As 
expected,  for  a  topical  treatment,  most  of  the  adverse  events  are  local  reactions.  The  types  of 
adverse  events  reported  are  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of  the  mono-therapies.  The 
incidence  of  adverse  events  appeared  to  be  higher  with  Brinz/Brim  as  compared  to  mono-
therapies, which was not unexpected.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
for  the  individual  active  components  have  been  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics. 
Comparative safety profile between Brinz/Brim and Brinz+Brim 
The  applicant  discussed  the  safety  data  of  C-10-041  alone  to  provide  a  direct  comparison  of 
Brinz/brim  with  concomitant  dosing  of  Brinz+Brim  as  used  in  clinical  practice.  The  adverse 
reaction profile in the two groups was broadly comparable. Some reported differences are: 
Adverse  drug  reactions  for  Hyperaemia  of  the  eye,  visual  disturbances,  punctuate  keratitis, 
keratitis  ocular  discomfort,  dysgeusia,  oral  dryness,  fatigue/drowsienss  were  reported  at  a 
slightly  higher 
incidence 
in 
the  Brinzolamide  +  Brimonidine  BID 
relative 
to 
the 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine BID group. 
Adverse drug reactions for corneal erosion, corneal deposit, hypermetropia and drug allergy were 
reported  in  very  small  numbers  the  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  group  but  not  in  the 
Brinz+Brim group.  
Adverse  drug  reactions  of  eye  irritation  and  allergic  conjunctivitis  were  slightly  higher  in  the 
Brinz/Brim group as compared to the Brinz+Brim group. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Brinz/Brim in terms of the types of adverse events is broadly comparable to 
the  safety  profiles  of  the  mono-therapies  and  concomitant  administration  of  Brinz+Brim.  As 
expected,  most  of  the  observed  adverse  events  were  topical  ocular  events,  of  which  common 
events included hyperaemia, visual disturbances, allergic reactions and ocular discomfort.  
The data from the clinical studies suggest that the overall safety profile in terms of the incidence 
of reported events is better for the mono-therapies as compared to Brinz/Brim, which in turn is 
comparable with a trend to be marginally better than Brinz+Brim concomitant administration.  
Assessment report

There is no long-term safety data for the combination, although it was acknowledged that there 
was long-term safety data for the mono-therapies. Therefore, the long-term safety for Brinz/brim 
can be addressed in the post-marketing phase. 
Overall, it was accepted that the safety profile of Brinz/Brim had been adequately characterised 
and did not raise any significant concerns as compared to Brinz alone and Brim alone, which are 
both currently used in clinical practice.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Simbrinza  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  (Brinz/Brim)  developed  to 
decrease  elevated  intra-ocular  pressure  (IOP)  in  adult  patients  with  open-angle  glaucoma  or 
ocular  hypertension.  Both  Brinzolamide  (Brinz)  and  Brimonidine  (Brim)  are  authorised  for  the 
same indication and their efficacy and safety profiles are well-established. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The combination of Brinz/Brim showed superior IOP lowering efficacy (statistically significant and 
clinically  relevant)  as  compared  to    Brinz  alone  and  Brim  alone  (study  C-10-040).  This  was 
demonstrated  in  one  pivotal  study  with  BID  dosing  as  measured  by  the  mean  diurnal  IOP 
reduction  from  baseline  after  3  months  of  treatment.  The  reduction  values  were  7.9  mm  Hg, 
6.5mm Hg and 6.4 mm Hg in Brinz/Brim, Brinz and Brim alone arms, respectively. Superiority of 
the  combination  was  also  generally  seen  for  other  secondary  endpoints  (mean  IOP  &  mean 
change  in  IOP  from  baseline  at  all  assessed  time-points  and  visits).  In  terms  of  responders,  at 
time of morning efficacy peak (+ 2h time point) through to month 6, up to 68% of patients on 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine, 46% on Brinzolamide and 45% patients on Brimonidine achieved IOP 
< 18 mmHg. The difference between the study arms was statistically significant in favour of the 
combination.                       
The  efficacy  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  Brinz/Brim  is  not  inferior  to  the  efficacy  of 
concomitant administration of Brinz+Brim as measured by the mean diurnal IOP reduction from 
baseline after 3 months of treatment (study C-10-041). The treatment group difference was -0.1 
mmHg with an upper bound of the 95% CI equal to 0.2 mmHg, which is below the pre-specified 
non-inferiority  margin  of  1.5  mmHg.  All  of  the  supportive  endpoints  in  this  study  were  also 
supportive of the conclusion drawn from the primary endpoint.  
The overall IOP lowering efficacy of Brinz/Brim was shown to have mean values of approximately 
8  mm  Hg,  which  constitutes  a  mean  IOP  reduction  of  23  to  37%  and  is  considered  clinically 
relevant. This is similar to the  effect  sizes for prostaglandin analogues (which are generally the 
preferred first-choice treatment) and beta-blockers.   
Simbrinza contains a lower amount of the preservative BAK than the concomitant administration 
of  the  two  active  components.  In  principle,  a  better  safety  profile  would  be  expected  from  a 
reduced daily exposure to BAK. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No  direct  comparison  between  BID  and  TID  dosages  has  been  performed  for  the  combination. 
From an indirect comparison no major differences were observed in terms of IOP levels reached 
when  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  was  dosed  twice  or  three  times  daily.  Whilst  the  magnitude  of 
the effect  (mean differences) with respect to  each  monotherapy could be slightly greater under 
TID regimen, results do not appear to be sufficiently meaningful to recommend a change in the 
posology.   
Long-term efficacy data for Brinzolamide/Brimonidine is available only up to 6 months. As Brinz 
alone  and  Brim  alone  do  not  have  any  known  waning  of  effects  with  long-term  treatment,  it  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/366328/2014 
Page 79/83 
 
  
  
reasonable  to  expect  a  similar  maintenance  of  effect  with  long-term  treatment  with 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine. However, direct evidence is not available.  
It  was  furthermore  observed  that  the  difference  in  the  IOP  lowering  effect  between 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine and Brinz alone increases with time especially at the trough IOP point 
(pre-dose).  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  observation  with  regard  to  the  choice  of  using 
monotherapy  vs.  combination  therapy  is  not  known  and  cannot  be  determined  based  on  the 
available  data.  However,  based  on  the  knowledge  of  maintenance  of  effects  of  Brinz  alone  and 
Brim alone and the observation of results of use of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine for 6 months, it is 
reasonable 
to  expect 
that 
there  will  not  be  significant 
loss  of  efficacy  when 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine is used continuously for longer than 6 months.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As  expected,  the  most  common  adverse  reactions  reported  in  the  pivotal  studies  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  were  ocular  reactions.  They  were  ocular  hyperaemia,  ocular 
discomfort,  visual  disturbances  and  ocular  allergy.  The  incidence  of  ocular  discomfort,  visual 
disturbances 
and 
ocular 
allergies 
is 
higher 
in 
the 
fixed 
dose 
combination 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  as  compared  to  the  monotherapies  and  generally  slightly  lower  than 
the concomitant administration of Brinz+Brim. Brinzolamide had the lowest incidence for many of 
the adverse reactions. 
Other  topical  events  included  adverse  reaction  of  the  corneal  surface  like  punctuate  keratitis, 
keratitis,  corneal  erosions,  corneal  deposits,  which,  however,  generally  have  a  low  incidence. 
Two events  of corneal erosions were classified as serious in the Brinzolamide/Brimonidine, both 
of 
which 
healed 
after 
appropriate 
treatment 
including 
discontinuation 
of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine. 
Dysgeusia,  dry  mouth  and  fatigue/drowsiness  were  the  common  systemic  events  reported  in 
these  studies  and  the  incidence  of  dry  mouth  and  fatigue  were  more  common  with  the 
Brimonidine containing treatment arms. 
The safety profile in the TID studies included the same type of adverse reactions as reported in 
the  BID  studies,  although  there  were  differences  in  the  incidence  of  these  events  between  the 
two  sets  of  studies.  The  incidences  of  ADRs  were  generally  higher  in  the  TDI  group,  which  is 
consistent with the higher daily dose administered in this regimen. The natures of the reactions 
reported are comparable with the reactions reported for the mono-therapies and the concomitant 
administration of Brinz+Brim and no new adverse reactions have been identified with the use of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine in these studies. 
Other  less  common  but  significant  risks  include  decreased  blood  pressure  and  pulse  rate,  an 
effect known with use of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can 
cause  increased  potential  for  developing  corneal  oedema,  although  none  have  been  reported  in 
the clinical studies.  
Assessment report

Several  events  of  diastolic  blood  pressure  increased  (8.5%  in  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  versus 
6.5%  in  Brinz+Brim,  4.1%  in  Brinz  and  6.9%  in  Brim,  respectively)  were  reported.  Whilst  the 
applicant  did  not  provide  explanations  for  these  observations,  it  was  agreed  that  the 
communication  of  this  risk  in  the  SmPC  could  be  considered  adequate  as  risk-mitigation 
measure. 
Potential  significant  interactions  include  acid-base  and  electrolyte  alterations  with  carbonic 
anhydrase inhibitors, rare fatalities due to systemic reactions to sulphonamide use (brinzolamide 
is a sulphonamide). Another potential risk is toxic ulcerative keratopathy due to the preservative 
benzalkonium  chloride.    Whilst  none  of  these  were  reported  in  the  clinical  studies  with 
Brinz/Brim,  they  are  potential  risks  based  on  knowledge  of  the  mechanism  of  action  of  the 
individual components. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects  
Corneal erosion (reported as serious adverse event) and corneal deposits were only observed in 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  BID  group  as  compared  to  the  other  treatment  groups  in  the  clinical 
studies. However, this is a known adverse event with the mono-therapies, although no event was 
reported  in  the  monotherapy  arms  in  these  studies.  The  number  of  events  of  such  occurrence 
was very small and so it cannot be said with certainty if there is an increased incidence with the 
combination.  However,  it  was  agreed  that  based  on  the  low  numbers  reported  in  the  clinical 
studies, the risk of these events can be considered to be consistent with the known risk profiles 
of the mono-therapies.  
Direct  safety  data  on  long-term  use  of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  is  not  available  and 
bibliographic data from its concomitant clinical use was also not discussed. It was acknowledged 
that there is long term safety for the two components that constitute the fixed dose combination. 
This will be addressed in the post-marketing phase. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  showed  superiority  over  the  mono-components  with  regards  to  IOP 
lowering  efficacy  and  the  magnitude  of  this  increased  efficacy  is  clinically  relevant.  Therefore, 
patients  who  are  inadequately  controlled  with  either  of  the  mono-components  are  likely  to 
experience  a  greater  benefit  with  this  combination.  All  fixed  dose  combinations  currently 
available include a beta-blocker as a component. Therefore, a fixed dose combination which does 
not  include  a  beta-blocker  would  be  an  important  alternative  for  patients.  Combining  of  two 
active  substances  in  one  preparation  is  convenient  for  patients  and  is  likely  to  have  a  positive 
impact on compliance.  
The  topical  ocular  adverse  reactions  reported  for  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  are  similar  to  the 
reactions reported for the mono-therapies. However, as they are chronic treatments, some of the 
reactions in the long-term may potentially be different for Brinzolamide/Brimonidine as compared 
to the mono-therapies. This needs to be monitored in the post-marketing phase. The number of 
withdrawals  due  to  adverse  reactions  is  more  than  10%  for  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  in  the 
Assessment report

studies,  which  is  a  significant  figure.  This  is  generally  comparable  to  the  discontinuation  rates 
with Brim alone, hence acceptable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  fixed  dose  combination  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  is  superior  to  Brinz  alone  and  Brim  alone 
and  non-inferior  to  concomitant  administration  of  Brinz+Brim  in  patients  with  open-angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension inadequately controlled on monotherapy. 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  appears  to  have  a  similar  safety  profile  as  that  of  Brinz  and  Brim  in 
combined  terms  of  the  nature  of  adverse  reactions.  The  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  appears 
to  be  marginally  higher  with  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  as  compared  to  mono-therapies. 
However, the incidence of adverse reactions with Brinzolamide/Brimonidine is comparable to that 
of  Brinz+Brim  concomitant  administration.  This  concomitant  administration  is  used  in  clinical 
practice for patients who do not respond adequately to one treatment alone.  
On  balance,  the  benefits  outweigh  the  risks  for  the  use  in  patients  whose  IOP  are  inadequately 
controlled  with  a  monotherapy.  The  benefit-risk  balance  for  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  is 
considered positive for the approved indication. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  benefits of  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  over  the  mono-components  in  the treatment  of  open-
angle  glaucoma  or  ocular  hypertension  have  been  demonstrated.  The  mono-components  are 
currently  used 
in 
the 
treatment  of 
the 
claimed 
indication.  The  efficacy  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  is  non-inferior  to  the  efficacy  of  concomitant  administration  of 
Brinz+Brim. These conclusions support the use of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine only in patients who 
are  not  adequately  controlled  with  mono-therapies  alone.  The  safety  profile  of 
Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  in  terms  of  the  nature  of  adverse  reactions  is  similar  to  the  mono-
components  in  that  there  are  no  new  adverse  reactions  of  significance  or  adverse  events  with 
greater  severity  that  seems  to  be  reported  with  Brinzolamide/Brimonidine  in  these  studies. 
Safety  data  are  available  only  for  6  months  and  direct  data  on  longer-term  is  not  available. 
However, taking in to consideration that there is long-term safety data available with Brinz alone 
and Brim alone, it was accepted that  data on long-term safety of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine can 
be collected in the post-marketing setting. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  with  Simbrinza  patients  and  doctors  will  benefit  from  the 
availability of a fixed dose combination that does not contain a beta-blocker (timolol). This would 
mean that patients who need more than one treatment to control their IOP and have a  contra-
indication  to  timolol  will  have  another  option.  Moreover,  the  fixed  dose  combination  will  be 
convenient  for  patients  who  would  otherwise  need  to  use  two  different  drops  and  this 
convenience is also likely to translate into better compliance and consequently better efficacy.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Simbrinza  for  the  decrease  of  elevated 
intraocular pressure (IOP) in adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension 
for  whom  monotherapy  provides  insufficient  IOP  reduction  is  favourable  and  therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Summary of risk management plan for BENLYSTA (belimumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Benlysta. The RMP details important 
risks of Benlysta, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Benlysta's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Benlysta's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Benlysta should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Benlysta should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Benlysta's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Benlysta is authorised
as an add-on therapy in patients aged 5 years and older with active, autoantibody-

positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g.
anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy

adult patients with active lupus nephritis (LN)
in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of
Benlysta is available as a subcutaneous injection (SC) or an infusion (IV). The IV route is 
approved for use in patients aged 5 years and older with SLE and adult patients with active lupus 
nephritis, whilst the SC route is approved only in adults with SLE and adult patients with active 
lupus nephritis. 
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains belimumab as the active substance and it is given 
by IV or SC route.  
Further information about the evaluation of Benlysta’s benefits can be found in Benlysta’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of Benlysta, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Benlysta's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Benlysta is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Benlysta are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered/taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Benlysta. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Infections

Risk factors and risk groups

Infections are a common source of morbidity and mortality in patients with 
autoimmune diseases such as SLE. In addition to the disease itself, the use 
of immunosuppressive agents such as steroids and cytotoxic agents (e.g., 
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and MMF)

Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical trial, post-marketing data and literature 
Infections, including PML, are common source of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with autoimmune diseases such as SLE. In addition to the disease 
itself, the use of immunosuppressive agents such as steroids and cytotoxic 
agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and MMF) 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
The IV and SC SmPC 
Routine activity includes appropriate labelling.  Section 4.4 Special warnings 
and precautions for use of the SmPCs contains the EMA SmPC text agreed: 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported with 
Benlysta treatment for SLE. Physicians should be particularly alert to 
symptoms suggestive of PML that patients may not notice (e.g., cognitive, 
neurological or psychiatric symptoms or signs). Patients should be monitored 
for any of these new or worsening symptoms or signs, and if such 
symptoms/signs occur, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic 
measures for PML should be considered. If PML is suspected, further dosing 
must be suspended until PML has been excluded.

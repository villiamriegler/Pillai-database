1.   NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Memantine LEK 10 mg film-coated tablets 
2.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each film-coated tablet contains 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride equivalent to 8.31 mg memantine. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3.  
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet. 
Yellow, oval film-coated tablet scored in one side. 
The tablet can be divided into equal doses. 
4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1   Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
4.2   Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of 
Alzheimer’s dementia. Therapy should only be started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor 
the intake of the medicinal product by the patient. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. 
The tolerance and dosing of memantine should be reassessed on a regular basis, preferably within three 
months after start of treatment. Thereafter, the clinical benefit of memantine and the patient’s tolerance of 
treatment should be reassessed on a regular basis according to current clinical guidelines. Maintenance 
treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit is favourable and the patient tolerates 
treatment with memantine. Discontinuation of memantine should be considered when evidence of a 
therapeutic effect is no longer present or if the patient does not tolerate treatment. 
Posology 
Adults 
Dose titration 
The maximum daily dose is 20 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable effects the maintenance 
dose is achieved by upward titration of 5 mg per week over the first 3 weeks as follows: 
Week 1 (day 1-7): 
The patient should take half a 10 mg film-coated tablet (5 mg) per day for 7 days. 
Week 2 (day 8-14): 
The patient should take one 10 mg film-coated tablet (10 mg) per day for 7 days. 
Week 3 (day 15-21): 
The patient should take one and a half 10 mg film-coated tablet (15 mg) per day for 7 days. 
From Week 4 on: 
The patient should take two 10 mg film-coated tablets (20 mg) per day.

Maintenance dose 
The recommended maintenance dose is 20 mg per day. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
On the basis of the clinical studies, the recommended dose for patients over the age of 65 years is 20 mg per 
day (two 10 mg tablets once a day) as described above. 
Renal impairment  
In patients with mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50 – 80 mL/min) no dose adjustment is 
required. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 – 49 mL/min) daily dose 
should be 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 
20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 5 – 29 mL/min) daily dose should be 10 mg per day. 
Hepatic impairment  
In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B), no dose 
adjustment is needed. No data on the use of memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available. Administration of Memantine LEK is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Memantine LEK in children aged below 18 years has not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration 
Memantine LEK is for oral use. 
Memantine LEK should be administered once a day and should be taken at the same time every day. The 
film-coated tablets can be taken with or without food. 
4.3   Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use 
Caution is recommended in patients with epilepsy, former history of convulsions or patients with 
predisposing factors for epilepsy. 
Concomitant use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists such as amantadine, ketamine or 
dextromethorphan should be avoided. These active substances act at the same receptor system as memantine, 
and therefore adverse reactions (mainly central nervous system (CNS)-related) may be more frequent or 
more pronounced (see also section 4.5). 
Some factors that may raise urine pH (see section 5.2 “Elimination”) may necessitate careful 
monitoring of the patient. These factors include drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a vegetarian 
diet, or a massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. Also, urine pH may be elevated by states of renal 
tubulary acidosis (RTA) or severe infections of the urinary tract with Proteus bacteria. 
In most clinical trials, patients with recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated congestive heart failure 
(NYHA III-IV), or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. As a consequence, only limited data are 
available and patients with these conditions should be closely supervised. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5  
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of memantine the following interactions 
may occur: 
•  The mode of action suggests that the effects of L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and anticholinergics may 
be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA-antagonists such as memantine. The effects of 
barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administration of memantine with the 
antispasmodic medicinal products, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify their effects and a dose 
adjustment may be necessary. 
•  Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of 
pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both active substances are chemically related NMDA-antagonists. The same 
may be true for ketamine and dextromethorphan (see also section 4.4). There is one published case report 
on a possible risk also for the combination of memantine and phenytoin. 
•  Other active substances such as cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine and nicotine that 
use the same renal cationic transport system as amantadine may also possibly interact with memantine 
leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels. 
•  There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) when memantine is co-
• 
administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
In post-marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases have 
been reported in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin. Although no causal relationship has been 
established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for patients concomitantly treated 
with oral anticoagulants. 
In single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance – active 
substance interaction of memantine with glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed. 
In a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of memantine on the pharmacokinetics of 
galantamine was observed. 
Memantine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin-containing monooxygenase, epoxide 
hydrolase or sulphation in vitro. 
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of memantine in pregnant women. Animal studies 
indicate a potential for reducing intrauterine growth at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher 
than at human exposure (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Memantine should not 
be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse reactions of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and compromises 
the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine LEK has minor to moderate influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care.

4.8   Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 1,595 
patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did not differ 
from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most 
frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than in the placebo 
group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), 
somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following Adverse Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical studies with 
memantine and since its introduction in the market.  
Adverse reactions are ranked according to system organ class, using the following convention: very common

Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-marketing 
experience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with memantine. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9   Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing experience. 
Symptoms 
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with either 
only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases below 140 
mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system (confusion, drowsiness, 
somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) and/or of gastrointestinal 
origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg 
memantine with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and agitation). 
The patient received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered without permanent 
sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 400 mg 
memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as restlessness, psychosis, 
visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and unconsciousness. 
Management  
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or overdose 
is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric lavage, carbo 
medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, forced diuresis 
should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in neurodegenerative 
dementia. 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction.

Clinical studies  
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe Alzheimer’s 
disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) included a total of 252 
outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison to placebo at 6 
months (observed cases analysis for the clinician’s interview based impression of change (CIBIC-plus): 
p=0.025; Alzheimer’s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; 
severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a 
statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: Alzheimer’s 
disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 (last observation 
carried forward (LOCF)). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease a total of 
470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. In the prospectively defined 
primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) from the 
six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies with patients 
on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically significant effect in 
favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. When patients were 
identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a statistically significant effect of 
memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated patients as memantine-treated patients 
showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%,p<0.0001). 
5.2   Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption  
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. There is 
no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution  
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to 150 
ng/mL (0.5 - 1 μmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 L/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation  
In man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. Main 
human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-memantine, and 
1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-antagonistic activity. No 
cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within 20 
days, more than 99% being excreted renally. 
Elimination  
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½ of 60 to 100 hours. In volunteers 
with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 mL/min/1.73 m² and part of total renal 
clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The renal 
elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to 9 (see 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a 
vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
Linearity  
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki= inhibition constant) of 
memantine, which is 0.5 μmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal vacuolisation 
and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum concentrations. Ataxia and 
other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the effects have neither been 
observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but not in 
monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not disclose any 
ocular changes. 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was observed 
in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic properties. There is a 
possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed in lungs. This effect was 
only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in rats 
and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse events of memantine were noted on fertility. In 
rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher than at 
human exposure.

It is not known whether memantine is excreted in human breast milk but, taking into consideration the 
lipophilicity of the substance, this probably occurs. Women taking memantine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse reactions of memantine were noted on non-clinical male and female fertility studies. 
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease usually causes impairment of driving performance and compromises 
the ability to use machinery. Furthermore, Memantine LEK has minor to moderate influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines such that outpatients should be warned to take special care.

Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1,784 patients treated with memantine and 1,595 
patients treated with placebo, the overall incidence rate of adverse reactions with memantine did not differ 
from those with placebo; the adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most 
frequently occurring adverse reactions with a higher incidence in the memantine group than in the placebo 
group were dizziness (6.3% vs 5.6%, respectively), headache (5.2% vs 3.9%), constipation (4.6% vs 2.6%), 
somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%) and hypertension (4.1% vs 2.8%).

Alzheimer’s disease has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. In post-marketing 
experience these reactions have been reported in patients treated with memantine. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9   Overdose 
Only limited experience with overdose is available from clinical studies and post-marketing experience. 
Symptoms  
Relative large overdoses (200 mg and 105 mg/day for 3 days, respectively) have been associated with either 
only symptoms of tiredness, weakness and/or diarrhoea or no symptoms. In the overdose cases below 140 
mg or unknown dose the patients revealed symptoms from central nervous system (confusion, drowsiness, 
somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression, hallucination, and gait disturbance) and/or of gastrointestinal 
origin (vomiting and diarrhoea). 
In the most extreme case of overdose, the patient survived the oral intake of a total of 2,000 mg memantine 
with effects on the central nervous system (coma for 10 days, and later diplopia and agitation). The patient 
received symptomatic treatment and plasmapheresis. The patient recovered without permanent sequelae. 
In another case of a large overdose, the patient also survived and recovered. The patient had received 400 mg 
memantine orally. The patient experienced central nervous system symptoms such as restlessness, psychosis, 
visual hallucinations, proconvulsiveness, somnolence, stupor, and unconsciousness. 
Management  
In the event of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic. No specific antidote for intoxication or overdose 
is available. Standard clinical procedures to remove active substance material, e.g. gastric lavage, carbo 
medicinalis (interruption of potential entero-hepatic recirculation), acidification of urine, forced diuresis 
should be used as appropriate. 
In case of signs and symptoms of general central nervous system (CNS) overstimulation, careful 
symptomatic clinical treatment should be considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics; Other Anti-dementia drugs, ATC code: N06DX01. 
There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning of glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular at 
NMDA-receptors, contributes to both expression of symptoms and disease progression in neurodegenerative 
dementia. 
Memantine is a voltage-dependent, moderate-affinity uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. It 
modulates the effects of pathologically elevated tonic levels of glutamate that may lead to neuronal 
dysfunction. 
Clinical studies  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A pivotal monotherapy study in a population of patients suffering from moderate to severe Alzheimer’s 
disease (mini mental state examination (MMSE) total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) included a total of 252 
outpatients. The study showed beneficial effects of memantine treatment in comparison to placebo at 6 
months (observed cases analysis for the clinician’s interview based impression of change (CIBIC-plus): 
p=0.025; Alzheimer’s disease cooperative study – activities of daily living (ADCS-ADLsev): p=0.003; 
severe impairment battery (SIB): p=0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease 
(MMSE total scores at baseline of 10 to 22) included 403 patients. Memantine-treated patients showed a 
statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: Alzheimer’s 
disease assessment scale (ADAS-cog) (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at week 24 last observation 
carried forward (LOCF). In another monotherapy study in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease a total of 
470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-23) were randomised. In the prospectively defined 
primary analysis statistical significance was not reached at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A meta-analysis of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores < 20) from the 
six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies with patients 
on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically significant effect in 
favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. When patients were 
identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, results showed a statistically significant effect of 
memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated patients as memantine-treated patients 
showed worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%,p<0.0001). 
5.2   Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption  
Memantine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. Tmax is between 3 and 8 hours. There is 
no indication that food influences the absorption of memantine. 
Distribution  
Daily doses of 20 mg lead to steady-state plasma concentrations of memantine ranging from 70 to 150 
ng/mL (0.5 - 1 μmol) with large interindividual variations. When daily doses of 5 to 30 mg were 
administered, a mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum ratio of 0.52 was calculated. The volume of 
distribution is around 10 L/kg. About 45% of memantine is bound to plasma-proteins. 
Biotransformation  
In man, about 80% of the circulating memantine-related material is present as the parent compound. Main 
human metabolites are N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan, the isomeric mixture of 4-and 6-hydroxy-memantine, and 
1-nitroso-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane. None of these metabolites exhibit NMDA-antagonistic activity. No 
cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism has been detected in vitro. 
In a study using orally administered 14C-memantine, a mean of 84% of the dose was recovered within 20 
days, more than 99% being excreted renally. 
Elimination  
Memantine is eliminated in a monoexponential manner with a terminal t½  of 60 to100 hours. In volunteers 
with normal kidney function, total clearance (Cltot) amounts to 170 mL/min/1.73 m² and part of total renal 
clearance is achieved by tubular secretion. 
Renal handling also involves tubular reabsorption, probably mediated by cation transport proteins. The renal 
elimination rate of memantine under alkaline urine conditions may be reduced by a factor of 7 to 9 (see 
section 4.4). Alkalisation of urine may result from drastic changes in diet, e.g. from a carnivore to a 
vegetarian diet, or from the massive ingestion of alkalising gastric buffers. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity  
Studies in volunteers have demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 10 to 40 mg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship  
At a dose of memantine of 20 mg per day the CSF levels match the ki-value (ki= inhibition constant) of 
memantine, which is 0.5 μmol in human frontal cortex. 
5.3   Preclinical safety data 
In short term studies in rats, memantine like other NMDA-antagonists have induced neuronal vacuolisation 
and necrosis (Olney lesions) only after doses leading to very high peak serum concentrations. Ataxia and 
other preclinical signs have preceded the vacuolisation and necrosis. As the effects have neither been 
observed in long term studies in rodents nor in non-rodents, the clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. 
Ocular changes were inconsistently observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, but not in 
monkeys. Specific ophthalmoscopic examinations in clinical studies with memantine did not disclose any 
ocular changes. 
Phospholipidosis in pulmonary macrophages due to accumulation of memantine in lysosomes was observed 
in rodents. This effect is known from other active substances with cationic amphiphilic properties. There is a 
possible relationship between this accumulation and the vacuolisation observed in lungs. This effect was 
only observed at high doses in rodents. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
No genotoxicity has been observed following testing of memantine in standard assays. There was no 
evidence of any carcinogenicity in life long studies in mice and rats. Memantine was not teratogenic in rats 
and rabbits, even at maternally toxic doses, and no adverse events of memantine were noted on fertility. In 
rats, foetal growth reduction was noted at exposure levels, which are identical or slightly higher than at 
human exposure.

Possible side effects 
1.   What Memantine LEK is and what it is used for 
How does Memantine LEK work 
Memantine LEK contains the active substance memantine hydrochloride. 
Memantine LEK belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-dementia medicines. 
Memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease is due to a disturbance of message signals in the brain. The brain 
contains so-called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors that are involved in transmitting nerve signals 
important in learning and memory. Memantine LEK belongs to a group of medicines called NMDA-receptor 
antagonists. Memantine LEK acts on these NMDA-receptors improving the transmission of nerve signals 
and the memory. 
What is Memantine LEK used for 
Memantine LEK is used for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
2.   What you need to know before you take Memantine LEK 
Do not take Memantine LEK 
• 
if you are allergic to memantine hydrochloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Memantine LEK  
• 
• 
if you have a history of epileptic seizures. 
if you have recently experienced a myocardial infarction (heart attack), or if you are suffering from 
congestive heart failure or from an uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). 
In these situations the treatment should be carefully supervised, and the clinical benefit of Memantine LEK 
reassessed by your doctor on a regular basis. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you suffer from renal impairment (kidney problems), your doctor should closely monitor your kidney 
function and if necessary adapt the memantine doses accordingly. 
The use of medicinal products called amantadine (for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease), ketamine (a 
substance generally used as an anaesthetic), dextromethorphan (generally used to treat cough) and other 
NMDA-antagonists at the same time should be avoided. 
Children and adolescents 
Memantine LEK is not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Memantine LEK 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This 
includes medicines obtained without a prescription. 
In particular, Memantine LEK may change the effects of the following medicines and their dose may need to 
be adjusted by your doctor: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan 
dantrolene, baclofen 
cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, nicotine 
hydrochlorothiazide (or any combination with hydrochlorothiazide) 
anticholinergics (substances generally used to treat movement disorders or intestinal cramps) 
anticonvulsants (substances used to prevent and relieve seizures) 
barbiturates (substances generally used to induce sleep) 
dopaminergic agonists (substances such as L-dopa, bromocriptine)

If you go into hospital, let your doctor know that you are taking Memantine LEK. 
Memantine LEK with food and drink 
You should inform your doctor if you have recently changed or intend to change your diet substantially (e.g. 
from normal diet to strict vegetarian diet) or if you are suffering from states of renal tubulary acidosis (RTA, 
an excess of acid-forming substances in the blood due to renal dysfunction (poor kidney function)) or severe 
infections of the urinary tract (structure that carries urine), as your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your 
medicine. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
The use of memantine in pregnant women is not recommended. 
Breast-feeding 
Women taking Memantine LEK should not breast-feed. 
Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive and to use machines safely.

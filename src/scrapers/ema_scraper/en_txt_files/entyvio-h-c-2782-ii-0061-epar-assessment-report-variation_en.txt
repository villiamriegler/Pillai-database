2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Patients with an ileoanal pouch are susceptible to a number of inflammatory complications, of which 
pouchitis is the most frequent long-term inflammatory complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis 
(IPAA). Pouchitis encompasses a variety of different causes and should be further classified as 
idiopathic or secondary. Secondary causes of pouchitis are many and include infections, ischemia, 
Crohn’s disease (CD) of the pouch, PSC-associated pouchitis, radiation, and medications, especially 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Secondary causes of pouchitis are important to 
consider, as up to 20%–30% of patients who present with chronic pouchitis may have an identifiable 
secondary cause. 
Pouchitis as a non-specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir is the most common complication after an 
IPAA for UC. Its frequency is related to the follow-up duration, occurring in up to 50% of patients 10 
years after IPAA. The cumulative incidence of pouchitis in patients with an IPAA following familial 
adenomatous polyposis is much lower, ranging from 0% to 10% but reasons for the higher frequency 
of pouchitis in UC patients remain unknown. Acute pouchitis, usually responds to a single or several 
courses of antibiotic therapy; however, 10% to 15% of patients with acute pouchitis may subsequently 
develop chronic pouchitis. Pouchitis may be considered treatment-responsive or treatment-refractory 
based on response to antibiotic monotherapy. Patients with chronic pouchitis not responding to 
conventional therapy have ongoing symptoms that may lead to pouch failure. The consequences of 
pouchitis that is inadequately controlled are debilitating such that they affect the work, domestic-life, 
and social interaction of the affected patients. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication for vedolizumab IV 300 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is 
for the treatment of adult patients with pouchitis, who have undergone proctocolectomy and ileal 
pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis, and have had an inadequate response with, lost response 
to, or were intolerant to antibiotic therapy. 
The MAH claims a new indication i.e. pouchitis, not considering study population already included in 
the approved indications. The support given in this respect is that pouchitis is considered by clinical 
experts to be an independent medical entity of IBD and is a distinct target disease separable from UC 
and CD, the current authorized conditions approved for vedolizumab. Characterization of pouchitis as a 
distinct disease target has been discussed by the Applicant by elaborating the anatomical 
characteristics of each disease, the classifications of each disease by International Classification of 
Diseases and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, the difference in diagnostic disease 
characteristics, and the varying responsiveness to certain treatments.

Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
IPAA is rare in the general population, thus, so too is pouchitis. In the largest epidemiological study, 
evaluating 62.9 million subjects in a commercial database in the United States (US), 6710 patients 
were diagnosed with pouchitis based on Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms 
(SNOMED-CT), the cumulative prevalence of pouchitis between 1999–2018 was estimated to be 1 in 
10,000. Another estimate (Orphanet) indicates pouchitis to occur in 1 to 5 per 10,000. This is 
consistent with an estimation in the European Union (EU) of 2.2 in 10,000 people noted in the Orphan 
Designations granted in 2009 and 2011 for alicaforsen (EU/3/09/641) and metronidazole 
(EU/3/11/875). Cumulative pouchitis prevalence includes all patients with pouches who may 
experience pouchitis at any point in time without considering annual or point prevalence. In addition, 
cumulative prevalence includes patients with pouches constructed for UC, FAP, and CD, and those who 
respond to antibiotics, which includes approximately 80% of patients with pouchitis.  
For patients with IPAA for UC and active pouchitis inadequately responding to antibiotic therapy, the 
applicant calculates an estimated prevalence to be approximately 2 to 3 per 100,000 patients. This 
value was derived utilizing a pouchitis prevalence of 2.2/10,000, and considers that: 1) not all patients 
had proctocolectomy and an IPAA pouch constructed for treatment of UC, 2) a high proportion of 
patients respond to antibiotics (approximately 80%), and 3) that some pouch inflammation is related 
to secondary causes such as infections (Clostridium difficile or viral infections). 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), typically considered as UC and CD, and pouchitis, another 
inflammatory condition in GI tissue, are complex polygenic disorders, characterized by a dysregulated 
immune response in the intestinal mucosa. In IBD, there is an inflammatory cascade in which white 
blood cells migrate from the systemic circulation into the GI tract. Like UC and CD, there is evidence 
that suggests that aberrant regulation of the mucosal immune system may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of pouchitis arising from an abnormal mucosal immune response to a dysbiosis of the 
pouch microbiota. In pouchitis, dysbiosis may contribute to the attraction of leukocytes by altering the 
integrin-mucosal addressing cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) interaction in the gut, pointing to 
integrins as being central to its pathophysiology. An increased proportion of mucosal dendritic cells 
expressing integrin β7 have been reported in patients with inflammation of the pouch compared with 
normal pouches, suggesting a possible role for integrin signaling in the pathogenesis of pouchitis. 
While pouchitis is the most common complication in patients who undergo IPAA to treat UC, as noted 
above, it is not completely restricted to patients with UC; however, pouchitis rarely occurs in patients 
with FAP, indicating that the underlying pathophysiology driving pouchitis shares some common 
characteristics with the pathophysiology associated with IBD. 
Pouchitis (primary idiopathic nonspecific inflammation of the pouch) should not be confused with pouch 
dysfunction, which although includes pouchitis, also results from secondary causes such as secondary 
infection, surgery-related mechanical complications, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
irritable pouch syndrome (IPS), or other autoimmune associations including primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, celiac disease, or CD of the pouch (Figure 1). Up to 30% of patients who present with 
chronic pouchitis may actually have an identifiable secondary cause.

a Pouchoscopy allows assessment of inflammation (severity and extent), pre-pouch ileitis, cuffitis, and 
postsurgical/mechanical complications. Additional biopsy, while providing histologic information, is not used to distinguish 
acute from chronic inflammation. 
Chronic pouchitis is considered to be an independent entity of IBD that shares a similar underlying 
pathophysiology with UC and CD. As stated in the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 
Guidelines, “although the aetiology of pouchitis remains unknown, it can be inferred from the 
predilection for patients with UC and the response to antibiotic therapy that the bacterial flora and/or 
other triggers of inflammation in UC are involved”.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis is removal of the colon followed by 
construction of an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Idiopathic inflammation of the “pouch,” 
commonly called pouchitis, is the most common long-term complication in these patients and is 
characterized by watery, sometimes bloody stool associated with urgency, incontinence, abdominal 
cramps, malaise, and fever. In addition to these symptoms, biopsy of the pouch shows inflammatory 
changes with intense infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells. 
Given the nonspecific nature of symptoms, the diagnosis of idiopathic pouchitis cannot be made from 
symptoms alone. Rather, characteristic endoscopic and histologic findings are required to accurately 
diagnose idiopathic pouchitis and to rule out secondary causes. 
Active pouchitis is characterized by neutrophil infiltration and inflammation of the portion of the small 
bowel that constitutes the pouch. 
Pouchitis may be classified based on duration of pouch-related symptoms as either acute (<4 weeks) 
or chronic (≥4 weeks). Pouchitis can develop, based on the number of episodes and response to 
antibiotics, from acute antibiotic-responsive to chronic antibiotic- dependent (≥3 antibiotic-responsive 
episodes a year; for some authors ≥4 episodes/year); in some patients, the symptoms persist despite 
a course of more than four weeks of antibiotic therapy (chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis or 
CARP). It is important to emphasize that pouchitis is a spectrum of disease, ranging from acute, 
antibiotic-responsive to chronic, antibiotic-refractory disease. 
In cases where chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis is suspected, it is important to rule out other 
diagnoses, such as a pouch outlet obstruction, strictures, pouch fistula, peripouch inflammation, 
cuffitis, prepouch ileitis, irritable pouch syndrome or secondary etiologies, such as infections (eg 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 9/106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, 
concomitant auto-immune disorders (eg coeliac disease) and pouch ischemia. Secondary causes of 
pouchitis are important to consider, as up to 20%–30% of patients who present with chronic pouchitis 
may have an identifiable secondary cause. 
Management 
Currently, there are no approved therapies for pouchitis in the EU, United Kingdom (UK), or US. 
Because pouchitis represents a disease spectrum ranging from acute antibiotic responsive to chronic 
antibiotic-refractory, optimal treatment regimens will vary. This condition is largely treated empirically 
with only small, predominantly retrospective studies having been conducted. Initial treatment of 
pouchitis focuses on correction of the perceived bacterial dysbiosis, with patients commonly prescribed 
antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, or rifaximin) as first-line treatment. Patients who develop 
chronic pouchitis either become dependent on antibiotics for symptom relief or have continuous 
symptoms despite chronic antibiotic therapy. 
A treatment algorithm for chronic pouchitis is summarized in Table 1. This algorithm is based on key 
clinical guidelines and consensus/review articles that describe widely used unauthorized therapies. The 
main European evidence-based consensus guidelines are from ECCO and from the British Society of 
Gastroenterology on the management of IBD. Both guidelines include the ileo-anal pouch disorders. 
Table 1 Treatment Algorithm for Chronic Pouchitis 
Antibiotics 
Combination of 2 antibiotics for ≥4 weeks. Ciprofloxacin with metronidazole or 
rifaximin is the most recommended combination.  
In the absence of response to antibiotic combination, fecal coliform testing 
should be considered to identify an appropriate alternative antibiotic and to 
rule out secondary causes of pouchitis.  
Steroids and 
Active steroids (oral budesonide, oral beclomethasone) for 8 weeks are 
immunomodulator 
alternative to antibiotics. The benefit of the immunomodulator tacrolimus 
(topical) is also reported.  
Biologics 
TNF-α antagonist drugs (infliximab as the first choice, and adalimumab as an 
alternative) are recommended for chronic treatment-refractory pouchitis. 
Benefit with vedolizumab therapy is reported.  
These therapeutic approaches are most often based on small and often observational clinical studies 
and there is limited evidence of efficacy for the treatment of chronic pouchitis with inadequate 
response to antibiotics. In addition to the multiple therapeutic agents in Table 1.a, 
nonpharmacological treatments have also been used in the management of pouchitis that include 
probiotics, diet, and fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) agents. 
Antibiotics and IBD therapies are currently being used long-term (and off-label) to induce and 
maintain remission in subjects with chronic pouchitis. However, multiple courses of antibiotics are 
associated with the development of antibiotic-related side effects and can lead to antibiotic 
dependence or resistance. Steroids should only be used short-term, and there remains limited 
evidence to support the use of immunosuppressants long-term. While anti-tumor necrosis factor 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 10/106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(TNFs) have some evidence supporting short-term effectiveness, long-term efficacy appears limited 
in patients with chronic pouchitis. In addition, anti-TNFs may be hampered by immunogenicity due 
to prior exposure (pre- and postcolectomy) potentially leading to reduced response or infusion 
reactions. Overall, the long-term benefit and the effectiveness of various treatment options, 
including antibiotics, probiotics, and other interventions used for treating pouchitis, are uncertain. 
In the largest phase 3 multicenter randomized placebo-controlled study, 138 subjects with chronic 
antibiotic-refractory pouchitis received 6-week alicaforsen (enema delivery) treatment therapy; 
however, the co-primary endpoints of endoscopic remission and reduction in stool frequency 
assessed at 10 weeks were not met. Alicaforsen is an ICAM-1 anti-sense oligonucleotide that targets 
the mRNA of ICAM-1 and also the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and was investigated as an agent that 
modulates immune responses at mucosal surfaces, a recognized target for treatment of IBD. 
Patients with pouchitis well-managed on antibiotics generally maintain a good quality of life; 
however, patients inadequately responding to therapy can experience severe symptoms including 
increased stool frequency, pain, depression, reduced satisfaction with social role, and fatigue. 
Furthermore, older age at the time of IPAA may impact the functional outcome and quality of life. 
Reports from long-term cohort studies demonstrate that inflammatory complications after IPAA 
create a significant burden for patients after colectomy. The biggest fear for many patients is 
returning to surgery, having their pouch removed, and being left with a permanent ileostomy. 
Overall, with no approved or satisfactory treatments available for this condition, a large unmet 
medical need exists. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Mode of action 
Vedolizumab is a gut selective immunosuppressive biologic. It is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 
monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the interaction of the α4β7 integrin on memory T and B 
cells with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 expressed on the vascular endothelium in the 
gut.  
Previously approved indications 
Entyvio was approved in the EU on 22 May 2014 (procedure EMEA/H/C/002782/0000) as 300 mg 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and is currently approved for the treatment of adult 
patients with moderately to severely active UC and Crohn’s disease who have an inadequate response 
with, lost response to, or who are intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor 
alpha antagonist. 
On  28  April  2020  an  extension  application  was  approved  to  introduce  a  new  pharmaceutical  form 
(solution  for  injection),  associated  with  a  new  strength  (108  mg)  and  a  new  route  of  administration 
(subcutaneous use) (procedure EMEA/H/C/002782/0000/X/0040). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the 
treatment of UC, CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1, includes a subsection for patients with pouchitis. The 
study is not compliant with the EMA GL with reference to the choice of primary endpoint mPDAI. 
The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP.

Methods 
The design of the pivotal Vedolizumab-4004 Study is presented in the figure below: 
Figure 2 Study Vedolizumab-4004 Planned Design 
The study comprised a 4-week (28-day) screening period that was followed by a 30 week randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period. 
The primary efficacy analysis was at 14 weeks and the secondary analysis at W34 (4 weeks after the 
last dose of study drug), with a final safety follow-up visit at W48. All subjects were expected to 
complete a long-term follow-up safety survey by telephone at W56, 26 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug.  
The population represented an antibiotic-refractory group of subjects with active disease despite 
receiving standard therapy, having: 
Chronic pouchitis defined as pouchitis requiring maintenance antibiotic therapy taken continuously for ≥
4 weeks immediately before the baseline endoscopy visit; or 
Recurrent pouchitis defined as pouchitis with ≥3 recurrent episodes within 1 year before screening, 
with each episode being treated with ≥2 weeks of antibiotic or other prescription therapy 
Study participants 
Key Inclusion criteria: 
1.  Male or female subject aged 18 to 80 years, inclusive. 
2.  The subject had a history of IPAA for UC completed at least 1 year before the D1 
(Randomization) Visit. 
3.  The subject had pouchitis that was chronic or recurrent, defined by an mPDAI score ≥5 
assessed as the average from 3 days immediately before the baseline endoscopy and a 
minimum endoscopic subscore of 2 (outside the staple or suture line) with either:

 (a) ≥3 recurrent episodes within 1 year before the screening period treated with ≥2 weeks of antibiotic 
or other prescription therapy, or  
(b) requiring maintenance antibiotic therapy taken continuously for ≥4 weeks immediately before the 
baseline endoscopy visit. 
4.  The subject agreed to take ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID) on D1 and through W4, regardless of 
the previous treatment and to stop any previous antibiotic therapy on D1 of the study.

The PDAI (18-point overall score), developed to standardize diagnostic criteria and assess the severity 
of pouchitis, is an objective and quantitative tool used for assessing pouch inflammation after IPAA and 
is shown in Table 9.c. It contains 3 separate 6-point scales based on clinical symptoms, endoscopic 
findings, and histologic change. Patients with a total PDAI score >7 points are classified as having 
pouchitis. 
The mPDAI consists of 2 separate 6-point scales from the clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings 
domains of the PDAI without inclusion of the histological findings domain (Table 2). The mPDAI uses a 
cut off of 5 for pouchitis. In addition, the total mPDAI score was used to assess disease severity 
whereby a total mPDAI score <5 was considered quiescent disease; 5 to 8 was moderately active; and 
a score 9 to 12 was severely active.

symptoms and QOL over the 2-week period before 
the study visits and rate each question on a 7-point 
Likert scale. A total IBDQ score, ranging from 32 to

Sample size 
The study initially aimed to recruit 200 subjects. This sample size was based on remission rates 
observed in patients with moderate to severe UC. However, given the rarity of the disease, recruitment 
of such large numbers became challenging. Furthermore, the sample size was later re-estimated based 
on published data on efficacy of infliximab (IFX) in patients with pouchitis based on the mPDAI. A total 
of 98 evaluable subjects (49 per treatment group) were required to provide 80% power to detect a 
25% difference in clinical remission rates between vedolizumab and placebo at the 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05, assuming a placebo remission rate of 15%. The revised planned sample size was 110 
subjects to account for attrition. The 25% treatment difference was based on the average of the 
postinduction remission (complete response) rates observed in 2 studies with IFX (32% and 21%). 
No statistical adjustments were made for multiple comparisons of other efficacy endpoints, and the p-
values provided for all other endpoints are therefore considered ‘nominal’ rather than confirmatory.

Randomisation 
An IWRS was accessed at screening to obtain a subject study-specific identification number (subject 
number) that was used to assigned subjects in a 1:1 ratio to receive infusions of vedolizumab IV or 
placebo IV.  
Randomization was stratified to achieve equal distribution across vedolizumab IV or placebo IV 
treatment groups by subject disease type: subjects with chronic pouchitis using antibiotic therapy at a 
stable dose for at least 4 weeks before randomization, and subjects with recurrent pouchitis who had 
experienced at least 3 episodes of pouchitis despite treatment (with pulse antibiotics or other 
prescription therapy) during the 1 year before baseline endoscopy (introduced with implementation of 
protocol amendment 03). The randomization schedule was generated by the IWRS before the start of 
the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain the blind, all study site personnel other than the investigational pharmacist were blinded 
to the treatment assignments for the duration of the study. The unblinded pharmacist obtained 
treatment assignments through the IWRS. 
The study drug blind was maintained using the IWRS. The IWRS assigned a Med ID to subjects 
randomized to the vedolizumab IV treatment group and provided that Med ID to the unblended site 
pharmacist/nurse by email notification. To maintain the blind, prepared study drug was covered in a 
blinding bag before dispensing. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study 
drug medication, analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study drug 
medication, analyzed according to the treatment they were randomized to. The FAS was used for the 
efficacy analysis. For this study, the FAS and SAF are identical. 
Per Protocol Set (PPS) includes all subjects in the FAS who did not have any major protocol violations.  
Methods for Handling Missing Data 
Missing Efficacy Data 
In general, continuous efficacy endpoints were analyzed once “as observed” and once with missing 
data imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. For analysis of response-type 
(binary) efficacy endpoints, all subjects with missing data for determination of the efficacy endpoint 
status were considered nonremitters/nonresponders in the analysis. 
Key features on handling of missing (m)PDAI data include: 
- 
For “as observed” summaries, missing (m)PDAI data were not imputed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 24/106 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
For all other summaries and analyses, if mPDAI and PDAI post-baseline assessments were 
partially missing, then the missing mPDAI/PDAI components were imputed with LOCF, thereby 
considering baseline data and unscheduled data (eg, reported at early discontinuation). 
Consequently, the respective PDAI domain subscore(s) and total PDAI score (and total mPDAI 
score, if applicable) were derived using the imputed individual components. Individual (m)PDAI 
components at baseline were not imputed. 
- 
- 
For summaries based on LOCF, completely missing mPDAI and PDAI assessments were 
imputed using LOCF. 
For primary analysis of PDAI-related response-type (binary) efficacy endpoints (such as mPDAI 
remission, PDAI remission, and partial PDAI response, etc), subjects with completely missing 
mPDAI and PDAI assessments at the respective analysis time point were considered as 
nonremitters/nonresponders. Sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of dropouts for different 
missing mechanisms was performed using a full LOCF approach and using a hybrid approach 
based on reason for dropout.  
Missing Safety Data 
In general, safety data were not imputed and reported data were summarized. 
Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analyses were based on the FAS. The primary statistical comparison for these 
efficacy endpoints between vedolizumab and placebo is based on the difference in response rates 
(vedolizumab minus placebo) expressed in percentage points (pp) and presented with corresponding 
95% CI, and the chi-squared test (2-sided) or, if the number of responders or non-responders in either 
of the 2 treatment groups was ≤5, the exact method test (ie, Fisher’s exact test). 
Formal statistical inference was performed only for the primary endpoint; however, further statistical 
tests for comparisons between the 2 treatment groups (vedolizumab IV and placebo) were performed 
for multiple secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints. Because no multiplicity adjustment for 
inferential testing for secondary and exploratory endpoints was preplanned, p-values from these tests 
are presented as nominal p-values. All statistical testing was performed at 2-sided 0.05 level of 
significance. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Clinical remission at W14 was undertaken on the FAS and a sensitivity analysis undertaken based on 
the PPS. Central readers used the endoscopy images/videos performed at screening (baseline), W14, 
and W34/ET. To account for the stratified randomization, response rates were also analyzed stratified 
by type of pouchitis using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, showing the risks of response, 
relative to placebo with 95% CI overall, and for the 2 types of pouchitis. The p-value for association 
between treatment and response was obtained from the CMH statistics. These additional analyses were 
conducted for clinical remission at W14 and W34 for the FAS and PPS, only if the number of 
responders and nonresponders in both treatment groups was >5. For these analyses, all subjects with 
missing data for determination of response at a time point were considered non-responders 
(nonresponse imputation). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
No multiplicity adjustment for inferential testing of the secondary and exploratory endpoints was 
considered; therefore, p-values were presented as nominal p-values only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 25/106 
 
 
 
Time to PDAI remission was analyzed using KM product limit methods and Cox proportional hazard 
regression (for FAS only). Subjects who did not achieve PDAI remission were censored at the time of 
their last PDAI assessment. 
Total PDAI and PDAI subscores (mPDAI score, clinical symptoms, endoscopic inflammation, and 
histologic inflammation) and their changes were summarized using descriptive statistics for the FAS 
and the PPS based on observed data. FAS analyses were repeated with missing data imputed using the 
LOCF approach. 
Subgroup analyses for the primary and secondary (clinical remission at W34, PDAI remission at W14 
and W34, and clinical response at W14 and W34) efficacy endpoints were performed by pouchitis 
classification, prior anti-TNF failure for pouchitis (started postcolectomy), prior anti-TNF exposure (pre- 
or postcolectomy), baseline severity based on mPDAI, baseline PMNL, time from IPAA to start of 
treatment, baseline FC, and baseline CRP. Analyses for PDAI remission at W14 and W34 were repeated 
for subgroups by baseline severity based on PDAI.  
Sensitivity analyses were based on the FAS for the following endpoints: 
-  Clinical remission at W14 and W34. 
- 
PDAI remission at W14 and W34. 
-  Clinical response at W14 and W34. 
-  Sustained mPDAI remission.  
-  Sustained PDAI remission.  
The following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
1. Imputation of all missing data using LOCF. 
2. Hybrid approach whereby interim missing data were imputed using LOCF and missing data after 
study drug discontinuation were imputed based on the primary reason for study drug discontinuation: 
missing data after study drug discontinuations due to AE or lack of efficacy were imputed using the 
nonresponse imputation (as done in the initial approach); missing data after study discontinuations for 
other reasons was imputed using LOCF. 
3. Non-response imputation for use of concomitant antibiotics relevant for UC/pouchitis (other than 
companion antibiotic given per protocol) before W14. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Sustained mPDAI remission and sustained PDAI remission were analyzed in the same manner as the 
primary endpoint for the FAS and PPS. 
The time to relapse of pouchitis (in days) was derived as the time between the day clinical remission 
was achieved (ie, the day the W14 mPDAI assessment was done) and the first day of relapse. Subjects 
without relapse after clinical remission until study completion or early study discontinuation, were 
censored at the time of their assessment, including the safety follow-up assessment.  
The total SES-CD score was summarized by descriptive statistics (including Wilcoxon rank-sum tests), 
once for observed data and once with LOCF applied. SES-CD response were summarized using 
response-type frequency tables with non-response imputation applied for the subset of subjects having 
at least 1 SES-CD assessment. 
Response concerning the PDAI-assessed clinical symptoms stool frequency and rectal bleeding were 
summarized by frequency tables for the FAS and PPS based on observed data; additionally, 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022

normalization of symptoms was summarized for the FAS and PPS applying nonresponse imputation for 
missing data.  
The single PDAI components (clinical, endoscopic and histologic) were summarized by frequency tables 
for the FAS and PPS based on observed data. Corticosteroid-free clinical remission and corticosteroid-
free PDAI remission at W14 and W34 were summarized using response-type frequency tables for the 
FAS, once for all subjects in the analysis population and once for the subset of subjects with 
concomitant corticosteroid use at baseline. 
Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses were performed using the SAF. The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs 
(defined as an AE with onset or worsening after first administration of study drug, regardless of 
relationship to study drug), AESIs, and SAEs that occurred on or after the first dose date, and up to 18 
weeks (126 days) after the last dose date of the study drug, were summarized

The study enrolled subjects at 31 sites worldwide (13 sites in North America and 18 sites in Europe 
[EU]). 
Date first subject signed informed consent form: 12 October 2016 
Date of last subject’s last visit/contact: 02 February 2021 
Date of last subject’s last procedure (Week 14) for collection of data for primary endpoint: 11 June 
2020 
Date of last dose of study drug: 01 October 2020 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
Five amendments to the original protocol (11 February 2016) were issued. The amendments generally 
cluster in 2 groups: amendments 01 through 03 were completed within 14 months of the original 
protocol (01 June 2016 through 21 April 2017) and early in the conduct of the study (first subject 
enrolled November 2016); and amendments 04 and 05 near the end of the study conduct (14 
September 2020 and 20 October 2020, respectively). 
• 
The principal changes in each amendment are summarized below. 
Protocol Amendment 01 (Global, Dated 01 June 2016) 
•  Clarification to the main exclusion criterion that an investigator should exclude a subject whose 
screening endoscopy showed a pattern of inflammation possibly due to CD. 
•  Clarification that the primary efficacy analysis includes all randomized subjects. 
Protocol Amendment 02 (Global, Dated 20 October 2016) 
−  Clarifications as related to ciprofloxacin: 
- Exclusion of subjects with tendon disorders related to quinolone administration. 
- Exclusion of subjects with G6PD deficiency per the ciprofloxacin summary of product characteristics. 
- Addition of 3 therapies to the excluded medications list known to interact with ciprofloxacin. 
−  Extension of the exclusion period for prior exposure to nonbiological agents to 5 half-lives of 
that agent. 
−  Clarification that poststudy, vedolizumab use would be by prescription only at the discretion of 
the treating physician. 
Protocol Amendment 03 (Global, Dated 21 April 2017) - Principal changes: 
•  Changed the assessment of the primary endpoint to be conducted using mPDAI score 
(including definition of clinically relevant remission using this scoring tool) rather than the PDAI 
score, which became a secondary endpoint. 
•  Added the specification that for subjects to be enrolled in the study they had to have a 
minimum endoscopic subscore of 2 and meet the definitions for recurrent or chronic pouchitis 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 28/106 
 
 
 
•  Reduced the number of biopsy samples collected at each endoscopy and specified that biopsies 
were to be assessed by trained central histopathologists. 
•  Revised the sample size calculation to be consistent with published remission rates and 
clinically significant effects observed in subjects with pouchitis rather than the prior estimates 
based on subjects with UC. 
•  Added a futility analysis after 25 subjects per treatment group complete W14 assessments. 
Protocol Amendment 04 (Global, Dated 14 September 2020) 
•  Addition of exploratory objectives and corresponding exploratory endpoints to assess ulceration 
in the pouch, including the number of ulcers and the ulcerated surface area. 
•  Addition of a description of the SES-CD procedure and scoring instrument as adapted for 
evaluation in only the pouch. 
Protocol Amendment 05 (Local/Germany, Dated 20 October 2020) 
Protocol deviations 
Of the 102 subjects, 39 subjects (38.2 %) had at least 1 study-specific significant protocol deviation 
(20 and 19 subjects in the placebo and vedolizumab IV groups, respectively). Significant protocol 
deviations included failure to satisfy entry criteria, receipt of concomitant medications (including 
antibiotics given after the first dose of study drug and before W14, excluding the companion antibiotic 
administered per protocol from D1 to W4), study procedures not performed per protocol (including 
missing W14 endoscopies or endoscopy recordings of poor quality), and study medication errors. 
Baseline data 
The vedolizumab and placebo groups were generally well balanced with respect to demographics at 
baseline and baseline disease characteristics.

a Type of pouchitis was derived from case report form–reported data on prior episodes and prior use of 
antibiotics. If a subject met both criteria for chronic and recurrent, the subject was categorized as 
chronic. 
b Type of pouchitis was reported in the interactive web response system as follows: 
“Antibiotic use = YES AND 3 current episodes of pouchitis = NO or YES” corresponds to chronic 
pouchitis. 
“Antibiotic use = NO AND 3 current episodes of pouchitis = YES” corresponds to recurrent pouchitis. 
c Subjects with mPDAI score <5 after adjudication of endoscopy were enrolled with mPDAI score ≥5 
based on initial endoscopy reading. 
d Multiple reasons for failure of prior anti-TNF treatment were possible 
e Concomitant corticosteroids included corticosteroids for UC or pouchitis starting before and ongoing 
on Day 1 
Prior treatments  
The most frequently reported prior medications for pouchitis (ie, started postcolectomy) were: 
ciprofloxacin (88.2%), metronidazole (68.6%), loperamide (25.5%), budesonide (22.5%), infliximab 
(21.6%), mesalazine (18.6%) and adalimumab (13.7%).  
Sixty-four subjects (62.7%) studied (33 subjects [64.7%] in the vedolizumab group and 31 subjects 
[60.8%] in the placebo group) had received an anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy either pre- or 
postcolectomy. However, the majority of patients in the placebo group (74.5%) as well as in the 
vedolizumab group (70.6%) wasn’t treated with anti-TNF therapy for the pouchitis (see the table 
above). Fifteen subjects (29.4%) in the vedolizumab group and 12 subjects (23.5%) in the placebo 
group had used and experienced failure of anti-TNF therapy postcolectomy.  
Ten subjects (19.6%) in the vedolizumab group and 12 subjects (23.5%) in the placebo group had 
received infliximab, while 9 subjects (17.6%) in the vedolizumab group and only 5 subjects (9.8%) in 
the placebo group had received adalimumab for pouchitis. 
Only 22.5% of patients received probiotics (21.6% in the vedolizumab vs 23.5% in the placebo group). 
At baseline, corticosteroid use was recorded for 5 subjects (9.8%) in the vedolizumab group and 8 
subjects (15.7%) in the placebo group, each of whom had who had been taking stable doses of these 
agents for at least 4 weeks before randomization (as permitted by the protocol).

The following reasons for the discontinuation of two principal antibiotic classes used are reported: 
It could be noted that around 15% of patients reported inadequate response for each type of 
antibiotics while only 3% each reported loss of response; the intolerance was not reported and 
majority of patients reported “other” as a reason for discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.

Concomitant treatment 
Concomitant antibiotic therapy for pouchitis (other than the protocol defined use of ciprofloxacin for 
the first 4 weeks) was prohibited from Day 1 through W14, but was allowed after W14 as needed. 
Despite concomitant antibiotic therapy being prohibited before W14, a similar proportion of subjects in 
both treatment groups (10 of 45 subjects [22.2%] in the vedolizumab group and 8 of 40 subjects 
[20.0%] in the placebo group) were receiving concomitant antibiotic therapy at W14. At W34, 7 of 33 
subjects (21.2%) in the vedolizumab group and 4 of 32 subjects (12.5%) in the placebo group were 
taking a concomitant antibiotic. 
Corticosteroid use at any time during the study (on/after D1) was reported in 7 subjects (13.7%) in 
the vedolizumab group and 11 subjects (21.6%) in the placebo group, being highest at D1 ( 4 subjects 
(7.8%) in the vedolizumab and 7 subjects (13.7%) in the placebo arm) and with gradual overall 
reduction of the number of patients throughout the study period (at W14 and W34 only 2 subjects and 
1 subject per group, respectively, received the corticosteroids). 
While is noted that 17.6 % of subjects in the placebo arm and 19.6% in the vedolizumab arm received 
vedolizumab as concomitant medication (Table 11h in the 4004 CSR), in the CSR is also stated that “in

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint Result –Clinical Remission (mPDAI) at Week 14 
The primary analysis of clinical remission, based on the full analysis set (FAS), showed that the 
remission rate observed among subjects receiving vedolizumab (16 subjects; 31.4%) was statistically 
significantly higher than among placebo-treated subjects (5; 9.8%). The treatment difference was 21.6 
percentage points (pp) (p = 0.013).

In the PPS, subjects with missing data at a time point were imputed as not achieving remission.  
a The 95% CI of the percentages were calculated using the exact method. 
b The p-value for the treatment difference in remission rates was obtained from the chi-squared 
test; if the number of responders or nonresponders in either of the 2 treatment groups was ≤5, the 
corresponding p-value from Fisher’s Exact test is shown. All p-values are nominal as no adjustment 
was made for multiplicity 
c In the analysis of data with LOCF imputation applied, completely missing mPDAI data at W14 was 
imputed using LOCF. In the hybrid approach, completely missing mPDAI at W14 was imputed based 
on the reason for drop-out (adverse event or lack of efficacy were imputed as nonremission). In the 
analysis accounting for concomitant antibiotic use before W14, subjects with missing data at a time 
point, and those receiving concomitant antibiotics before W14 were imputed as not achieving 
remission. 
Subgroup analyses were done by type of pouchitis, prior anti-TNF failure for pouchitis (started 
postcolectomy), prior anti-TNF exposure, baseline severity based on mPDAI, baseline PMNL, time from 
IPAA to start of treatment, baseline FC, and baseline CRP. Results from subgroup analyses were 
illustrated in forest plots for the treatment difference in response rates with corresponding 95% CI by 
subgroup.

At week 14, the mPDAI remission rates in the vedolizumab group were generally higher compared with 
placebo except in subgroups based on baseline non/mild PMNL histology and Southern Europe 
geographic region (France, Spain, Italy). Subgroup analyses based on baseline disease characteristics 
suggested a greater treatment response among patients with recurrent pouchitis, 
moderate/severe+crypt abscess histology, < 7years from IPAA to start of treatment, FC ≤250 mcg/g, 
CRP≤5 mg/L, North America geographic region. 
At week 34, the mPDAI remission rates in the vedolizumab group were generally higher compared with 
placebo except in subgroups based on anti-TNF postcolectomy failure, baseline non/mild PMNL 
histology and Southern Europe geographic region (France, Spain, Italy). Subgroup analyses based on 
baseline disease characteristics suggested a greater treatment response among patients with recurrent 
pouchitis, anti-TNF not used post-colectomy, anti-TNF experienced (UC or pouchitis), severely active

disease (mPDAI), moderate/severe+crypt abscess histology, FC ≤250 mcg/g, CRP≤5 mg/L, North 
America geographic region. 
The analogue analysis results of PDAI remission at W14 and W34 are generally overlapping with 
mPDAI remission results except that at W34 anti-TNF naïve performs slightly better with vedolizumab 
than anti-TNF experienced postcolectomy.

The treatment difference of mPDAI remission rates at W34 was 17.6 pp (nominal p = 0.043). Results 
for the PPS showed that the remission rate in this population was 16.2 pp higher in the vedolizumab 
group than in the placebo group (nominal p value = 0.112). In the LOCF and hybrid analyses the 
remission rates were 17.6 pp higher with vedolizumab than with placebo (nominal p = 0.048). A 
further analysis, undertaken to assess the impact of concomitant antibiotic use, showed the treatment 
difference of 15.7 pp (nominal p = 0.054).

the reason for drop-out (adverse event or lack of efficacy were imputed as non-remission). In the 
analysis accounting for concomitant antibiotic use before W14, subjects receiving concomitant 
antibiotics before W14 were imputed as not achieving remission 
The sensitivity analysis using the LOCF and hybrid approach and analysis accounting for concomitant 
antibiotic before Week 14 all supported the superiority of vedolizumab over placebo in inducing PDAI 
remission at W14 and W34. The PPS analysis was supportive only for W14 results. 
•  Time to PDAI remission 
In the vedolizumab group 18 subjects had achieved PDAI remission by Day 106 (W14 +7 days), and 
21 had achieved remission by Day 253 (W34 + 14 days). In the placebo group 6 subjects had 
achieved PDAI remission by Day 106, and 11 by Day 253. The median time to PDAI remission in the 
vedolizumab group was estimated as 239 days (and was not estimable for placebo).

Mean changes from baseline in the histological domain score, suggested slightly greater improvement 
in the vedolizumab group than in the placebo group. At W14, the mean change was -0.5 in the 
vedolizumab group and -0.1 in the vedolizumab group. At W34 the mean changes were -0.4 and -0.1, 
respectively. 
Overall, only endoscopic subscore (Figure 2.c) showed important differences between placebo and 
vedolizumab group, that were also statistically significant at W14. The results of clinical and histologic 
subscores revealed only tendency of numerically better results with vedolizumab than with placebo.

c In the analysis of data with LOCF imputation applied, completely missing PDAI data at W14 was 
imputed using LOCF 
These data show better results for recurrent pouchitis but also the lack of statistical significance for the 
results of patients with chronic pouchitis. 
Exploratory endpoints:  
The results from most exploratory endpoints are only descriptive (mean, SD, median) and could be 
summarized as follows: 
•  Change from baseline in RHI (Robarts Histology Index) was greater in the vedolizumab 
group than in the placebo group as well as the rate of patients with histological remission and 
minimal histological activity 
•  Change from baseline in FC: Values of FC obtained during the study showed a high degree 
of variability between subjects within each treatment group; however, median reductions in FC 
levels were higher in the vedolizumab group than in the placebo group at W14 and at W34 
•  Change from baseline in CRP: No difference in the change from baseline in CRP was noted 
between placebo and vedolizumab groups at different time points 
•  Time to relapse of pouchitis symptoms and number of relapses 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 54/106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sixteen subjects in the vedolizumab group and 5 subjects in the placebo group had achieved clinical 
remission at W14. Five of 16 subjects (31.3%) in the vedolizumab group and 2 of 5 subjects (40%) in 
the placebo group experienced a worsening of pouchitis symptoms after W14. The median time to 
relapse was 66.5 days in the placebo group and 75 days in the vedolizumab group. 
•  Changes in number of ulcers in the pouch, proportion of surface area in the pouch 
that is ulcerated, and SES-CD score in the pouch: Changes in the total number of all 
ulcers and in the number of large (nonaphthous) ulcers at each visit were larger in the 
vedolizumab group than in the placebo group. More subjects in the vedolizumab group than in 
the placebo group had decreases in the proportion of the surface occupied by large ulcers. 
•  SES-CD response: The mean changes in SES-CD were more marked in the vedolizumab 
group than in the placebo group both at W14 (-1.7 vs 0), and at W34 (-1.3 vs -0.6). In 
addition, more subjects in the vedolizumab group than in the placebo group were recorded as 
being in endoscopic remission based on a SES-CD score ≤2: 20.8% versus 6.0% at W14 and 
22.9% versus 10.0% at W34. 
•  Change in stool frequency: The tendency towards improved stool frequency with 
vedolizumab; the number of subjects with increased stool frequency at baseline who achieved 
their usual postoperative frequency and the number of subjects who had a reduction from ≥3 
stools more than usual at baseline to ≤2 stools more than at baseline at W14 and W34 was 
slightly higher in the vedolizumab group than in the placebo group.

1.  Clinical Symptom Components: 
•  Stool frequency: see above 
•  Rectal bleeding: Among the small subset of subjects who had daily rectal bleeding at baseline 
(12 (23.5%) in the vedolizumab group and 8 (15.7%) in the placebo group), improvements, in 
terms of subjects reporting no rectal bleeding or only rare occurrences of bleeding at W14 and 
W34, were observed in a higher proportion of subjects treated with vedolizumab than in those 
treated with placebo. 
• 
• 
Fecal urgency or abdominal cramps: no difference between two groups at W14 and no major 
difference at W34. At W34, 20 of 36 subjects (55.6%) in the vedolizumab group had a score of 
0 (no fecal urgency or abdominal pain) vs 12 of 31 subjects (38.7%) in the placebo group. 
Fever: present only in 2 patients of placebo group at baseline, none at W14 and in 1 patient in 
vedolizumab group at W34 
2.  Endoscopic components: 
•  Ulceration: Of the subjects who had large ulcers at baseline 11 of 40 subjects (27.5%) in the 
vedolizumab group had no large ulcers at W14 or at W34 compared with 5 of 36 (13.9%) and 
7 of 36 (19.4%) in the placebo group who had no large ulcers at W14 and W34, respectively 
• 
• 
• 
Friability: more subjects in the vedolizumab group than in the placebo group had absence of 
friability reported at W14 (22 of 45 subjects, 48.9% vs 9 of 40 subjects, 22.5%) and W34 (20 
of 33 subjects, 60.6% vs 13 of 32 subjects, 40.6%). 
Edema: At W14, edema was reported as absent in 9 of 45 subjects (20%) in the vedolizumab 
group and in 3 of 40 subjects (7.5%) in the placebo group, and at W34, edema was reported 
as absent in 10 of 33 subjects (30.3%) in the vedolizumab group and 7 of 32 subjects (21.9%) 
in the placebo group. 
Loss of vascular pattern: no major difference between the groups at W14 and W34. At 
Baseline, 1 subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group had visible vasculature compared with 5 
subjects (9.8%) in the placebo group. At W14, 7 of 45 subjects (15.6%) in the vedolizumab 
group had visible vasculature vs 3 of 40 subjects (7.5%) in the placebo group, and at W34, 9 
of 33 subjects (27.3%) had visible vasculature in the vedolizumab group vs 6 of 32 subjects 
(18.8%) in the placebo group. 
3.  Histologic components: 
• 
PMNL infiltration: At W14, 23 of 45 subjects (51.1%) in the vedolizumab group compared with 
12 of 41 subjects (29.3%) in the placebo group had no infiltration or mild PMNL infiltration. 
Similarly, at W34, a higher proportion of subjects in the vedolizumab group (20 of 35; 57.2%) 
than in the placebo group (10 of 32; 31.3%) had no infiltration or mild infiltration of PMNLs. 
•  Ulceration: similar proportions of subjects were histologically ulcer free at baseline: 68.0% in 
the vedolizumab group and 64.7% in the placebo group; At W14, 77.8% of subjects in the 
vedolizumab group and 68.3% in the placebo group had no histologic evidence of pouch 
ulceration and at W34, 80% of subjects in the vedolizumab group and 68.8% in the placebo 
group had no histologic evidence of ulceration in the pouch.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of the sought indication the MAH is providing evidence from one pivotal study only, 
Vedolizumab-4004, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab IV 300 mg in the treatment of adult subjects who had 
a proctocolectomy and IPAA for treatment of UC and had developed chronic refractory or recurrent

pouchitis. Therefore, the relevant guideline (POINTS TO CONSIDER ON APPLICATION WITH 1. META-
ANALYSES; 2. ONE PIVOTAL STUDY, CPMP/EWP/2330/99) applies in this context.  
The study design included a 30-week double-blind treatment period, with a final safety follow-up visit 
at W48. All subjects received concomitant antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin (considered a 
companion antibiotic) 500 mg twice daily through W4. The design of the pivotal study is acceptable, as 
per the EMA Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative 
Colitis (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1). 
The study included subjects with active pouchitis (defined as mPDAI score ≥5 assessed as the average 
from 3 days immediately before the baseline endoscopy and a minimum endoscopic subscore of 2), 
that have recurrent pouchitis (≥3 recurrent episodes within 1 year before the screening period treated 
with ≥2 weeks of antibiotic or other prescription therapy), or chronic refractory pouchitis (requiring 
maintenance antibiotic therapy taken continuously for ≥4 weeks immediately before the baseline 
endoscopy visit). The MAH has clarified that in the definition of the recurrent pouchitis “other 
prescription therapy” was referred to treatments other than antibiotics used in the clinical practice. The 
two subtypes of pouchitis could have a different clinical course and expected response to antibiotic 
treatment, and therefore potentially a heterogeneous response to vedolizumab, therefore the MAH’s 
choice to mix these subtypes in the study is not seen as the preferred choice although it is recognized 
that could be challenging to perform separate studies. Randomization was stratified by the type of 
pouchitis (recurrent or chronic). Overall inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate for 
selecting a target population with a diagnosis of idiopathic chronic pouchitis. Secondary aetiologies are 
excluded. However, the MAH was asked to provide some clarification on  exclusion of secondary causes 
of pouchitis such as CMV infection and pelvic sepsis. The claimed indication was revised, as requested, 
to reflect the setting investigated and subject’s characteristics including severity of the disease 
(moderate to severe) and exclusion of patients intolerant to antibiotics. 
Criteria for defining concomitant allowed or prohibited therapies and stable doses are considered 
acceptable. However, since two different subtypes of pouchitis are included, one responsive to 
antibiotics and the other not, the role of companion antibiotic and the potential impact on efficacy at 
week 14 could be potentially different. However, from further data provided by the MAH the efficacy in 
both subgroups seems not to be influenced by the companion antibiotic. The use of the companion 
antibiotic (4 weeks of concomitant ciprofloxacin) in both subgroups was added in 4.2 section of the 
SmPC upon request.   
Clarification has been received for the chronic refractory pouchitis on fulfilment of ECCO guidelines 
2017 criteria on the first line therapy, these are met by a majority of patients particularly when an 
extended (alternative) approach compared to more stringent one was used.  
The study endpoints are aimed at assessing the efficacy of vedolizumab on symptoms, endoscopic and 
histological findings and could be overall acceptable. However, the selection of the primary estimand 
(mPDAI) lacking histology assessment as compared to the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) is 
not fully in line with the relevant EMA GL. The selection was not discussed within a SA. The EMA 
Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1) highlights the importance on demonstrating efficacy in terms of 
symptoms as well as mucosal healing (including histological assessment) (defined as co-primary 
endpoints). The relevant GL also reports that the 18-point PDAI, combining all three aspects 
(symptoms, macro- and microscopic appearance of mucosa) has been used to measure disease 
activity and response. However, this instrument is not fully validated and there are no generally 
accepted definitions of response and remission.  Nevertheless, the use of PDAI is considered 
acceptable provided that response and remission are convincingly defined and provided that clinically 
Assessment report

Page 63/106 
 
 
 
relevant effects in each of the main components of the score (symptoms as well as macro- and 
microscopic appearance of mucosa) are demonstrated (EMA GL CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1). 
The definition of the primary endpoint of the study was changed from PDAI to mPDAI clinically relevant 
remission, based on a claimed similar sensitivity and specificity of the mPDAI when compared with the 
PDAI (Shen 2003). However, it should be noted that this study refers only to an acute setting and 
therefore these results could not be simply translated on a chronic setting. Supportive data of a similar 
sensitivity and specificity of the mPDAI when compared with the PDAI in the setting of chronic 
pouchitis was provided, however this analysis was done only using data from this study. Therefore, 
although the concordance of PDAI and mPDAI scores in this study is relevant, the result could not be 
used to validate these tools. The primary evaluation for induction of efficacy was set at week 14 which 
is considered acceptable; evaluation of duration of efficacy was set at week 34, four weeks after the 
last dose of vedolizumab.  From data coming from the study is not possible to gain information on 
when treatment could be stopped or when retreatment could be considered. The MAH addressed the 
point of stopping treatment (i.e. if no evidence of therapeutic benefit is observed by 14 weeks of 
treatment) but did not provide data on potential retreatment. SmPC was updated to reflect this 
information which is acceptable. 
The assumptions made for the sample size calculation raised concerns. The original sample size was 
based on the observed remission rate in GEMINI 1 study conducted in subjects with moderate to 
severe UC (200 patients). However, since pouchitis is different from UC a new assessment using 
published data [Ferrante 2010, Barreiro-de Acosta 2012] was made (Amendment 3 of the Study 
Protocol), and the sample size was redefined (total of 98 evaluable subjects were required to provide 
80% power to detect a 25% difference in clinical remission rates between placebo (15%) and 
vedolizumab (40%) at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05). However, the placebo rate does not 
seem to be supported by the two proposed published studies since both of them are retrospective 
uncontrolled studies; moreover, the average rate of clinical remission with infliximab from those 
studies (32% and 21%) could not be considered as the expected difference from placebo. The MAH 
justified the sample size calculation by assuming the optimistic (compared with infliximab) mPDAI 
remission rate at W14 of 40% for vedolizumab in conjunction with the conservative assumption of a 
high placebo remission rate of 15%, and therefore a treatment difference of 25% for vedolizumab 
relative to placebo. Although this treatment difference was not achieved in the results of Study 
Vedolizumab-4004 (placebo around 10% and vedolizumab around 31%) the treatment effect estimate, 
that can be considered around 20%, was statistically significant and confirmed by several sensitivity 
analyses.  
Methodological aspects: the primary analysis was conducted on FAS population under the ITT principle. 
The study was powered for the difference in the primary estimand, and the analysis of the two 
populations (chronic and recurrent pouchitis) for the primary estimand was considered as sensitivity 
analysis. Therefore, the analysis does not follow the EMA guideline on covariates 
(EMA/CHMP/295050/2013) by omitting stratification variables. No multiplicity adjustment for 
inferential testing of the secondary and exploratory endpoints was considered; therefore, p-values 
were presented as nominal p-values only. In order to rely on more robust data, the MAH has provided 
new analyses that takes into account for multiple testing on the main secondary endpoints. The hybrid 
approach for handling missing data was questioned, and results after imputing missing data as LOCF 
or as non-responder have been presented separately as well as a jump-to-reference imputation with 
tipping point analysis; these analyses were also applied to the main secondary endpoints for which 
sensitivity analyses have been performed. Considering the analysis applied for secondary endpoints 
looking at Change from baseline as in PDAI endoscopic subscore, in PDAI histologic subscore, and in 
Total PDAI score, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was considered more appropriate and has 
been performed using the baseline score as covariate, and including the treatment and the 
Assessment report

stratification stratum as explicative factors. Analysis of Time-To-Event Endpoints showing the Kaplan-
Meier curves including the Log-rank test results to assess the difference between active treatment and 
placebo was performed. 
One hundred and sixty-five patients with chronic or recurrent pouchitis were screened and a total of 
102 eligible patients were randomised, treated and included in the FAS; 51 of them received 
vedolizumab 300mg IV. Patient’s disposition was generally balanced across the study. However, it 
should be noted that a relevant number of patients discontinued the treatment (vedolizumab n= 15, 
placebo n= 19); the main reasons were: lack of efficacy, voluntary withdrawal and PTE/AE (pre-
treatment event/adverse event). Moreover, due to a relevant number of major protocol violations 
(including missing w14 mPDAI values), the PPS included only 38 patients in the placebo arm and 43 
patients in the vedolizumab arm. The enrolment sites across EU were adequately represented.  
Two most substantial amendments occurred, namely the change of the primary endpoint from PDAI to 
mPDAI clinical remission and the reduction of the sample size from 200 to 110 subjects. These 
changes occurred early during study conduct, the MAH  has specified that a total of 19 of 102 subjects 
(18.6%) have been enrolled before implementation of PA3; 9 of 102 subjects (8.8%) had completed 
their W14 assessments before PA3. Concerning the change of the inclusion criteria in the PA3 8 
subjects (5 placebo, 3 vedolizumab) would not satisfy either the modified definition for chronic or 
recurrent (subsequently classified as recurrent). There was a high rate of significant protocol 
deviations: 39 subjects (38.2 %) had at least 1 study-specific significant protocol deviation (20 and 19 
subjects in the placebo and vedolizumab IV groups, respectively). The most frequently reported were: 
concomitant medications in 11 subjects (21.6%) in each group; and procedure not performed per 
protocol in 10 subjects (19.6% placebo group) and 4 subjects (7.8% vedolizumab), respectively.  
Overall, the majority of subjects (68.6%) were male, mean age 41.9 years, most of them with ≥7 
years from IPAA likely representing a population that could suffer from idiopathic chronic pouchitis. 
Subject were randomized by type of pouchitis with an equal distribution 1:1. During the blind data 
review the definitions were revisited and therefore the pouchitis was classified as chronic in 49.0% of 
patients in the placebo arm and in 56.9% in the vedolizumab arm; accordingly, recurrent pouchitis was 
present in 51.0% of placebo and 43.1% of vedolizumab arm patients. To better characterize the 
population included in the study the MAH was asked to provide the duration of the disease i.e. time 
since pouchitis diagnosis for both subgroups however this information was not collected. Moreover, 
according to the Pouchitis Related Baseline Characteristics, ten patients were classified as recurrent 
pouchitis, although having only 1 or 2 episodes of pouchitis in the last 12 months. Satisfactory 
clarification of this issue was provided. 
Disease activity: the mean baseline total mPDAI score was 8.0 (SD = 1.68): 62% of subjects had a 
moderately active disease (baseline score between 5 and 8) and 36.3% as severely active (score of 9 
to 12); and 2 subjects had an mPDAI score <5 (excluded from the PPS). The distribution of subjects 
between treatment groups was similar. Looking at PDAI the mean value was 10.5 (SD 2.33) and 80% 
had moderate (7-12) and 18% severe (13-18) activity according to score system. Therefore, the 
majority of enrolled population had moderately active disease and the claimed indication has been 
revised to reflect the setting investigated and the characteristics of patients. 
Considering PDAI clinical criteria the majority of subjects had 3 or more stools/day > postoperative 
usual, presented fecal urgency or abdominal cramps but remarkably most of them presented no/rare 
rectal bleeding and no fever. Considering the endoscopic inflammation PDAI criteria, these were 
present in most of the study subjects although data on granularity and mucus exudates are missing. 
Considering the acute histologic inflammation PDAI criteria, PMNL infiltration was moderate in the 
56.4% and severe in the 21.8% of the study population, well balanced between two groups; instead, 
the mild infiltration was present in more subjects in the placebo group (21.6%) than in the 
Assessment report

vedolizumab group (16%); the percentage of subjects being histologically ulcer free at baseline was 
68.0% in the vedolizumab group and 64.7% in the placebo group. When pouchitis is diagnosed 
endoscopically, histological evidence of acute inflammation is invariably present [Tytgat, 1988].  
Considering prior anti-TNF medications history for pouchitis, around one third of the study population 
was anti-TNF naïve (both pre- and post-colectomy) and only 27.5% of patients were treated with anti-
TNF therapy post-colectomy. According to the previous response to antibiotic therapy around 15% of 
patients reported inadequate response for each type of antibiotics while only 3% each reported loss of 
response; the intolerance was not reported and the majority of patients reported “other” as a reason 
for discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. The claimed indication was revised excluding patients who 
were intolerant to antibiotic therapy. Even if the concomitant antibiotic therapy was not permitted until 
the end of the W14, it should be noted that 22.2% patients in the vedolizumab group (10 of 45 
patients) and 20.0% in the placebo group (8 of 40 patients) were receiving concomitant antibiotic 
therapy at W14. Furthermore, there were more patients in the vedolizumab arm (7 of 33, 21.2%) than 
in the placebo arm (4 of 32, 12.5%) receiving the concomitant antibiotic therapy at W34. This 
deviation is taken into account by the sensitivity analysis with concomitant antibiotic therapy. 
Considering the importance of concomitant antibiotic therapy particularly for patients with recurrent 
pouchitis, the MAH has provided the rate of use of concomitant antibiotics by type of pouchitis, at W14 
and W34 timepoints for both arms showing that a greater proportion of subjects in the VDZ group 
were administered concomitant antibiotics as compared with the PBO group. This trend was consistent 
in each of the 2 pouchitis subgroups however could be more relevant for the recurrent type. Only a 
minority of patients (more in the placebo arm (8 patients (15.7%)) than in the vedolizumab arm (5 
patients (9.8%)) had concomitant use of corticosteroids at baseline. There was some difference 
between concomitant corticosteroid use rate at D1 (13.7% in the placebo and 7.8% in the vedolizumab 
group). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoint: a statistically significant higher proportion of patients in the vedolizumab IV 
300mg group reached mPDAI remission at week 14 in comparison to the placebo group (31.4% vs 
9.8% respectively), with a treatment difference of 21.6% (95% CI: 4.9, 37.5) p=0.013 on FAS 
analysis. The observed effect size does not support the planned difference of 25% between 
vedolizumab and placebo raising concerns on the clinical relevance of vedolizumab effect. Moreover, 
the effect size on the primary estimand appears different between chronic (15.6%, 95% CI -5.1, 36.2) 
and recurrent pouchitis (28.7%, 95% CI 6.1, 51.2) and wide confidence intervals were detected. From 
a clinical perspective a smaller effect size could be expected in subjects with chronic antibiotic 
refractory pouchitis with a more difficult to treat disease and from a methodological perspective small 
sample size of the subgroups is seen as a limitation.  
Based on the predefined randomization scheme and on the results of the primary endpoint showing 
different effects per type of pouchitis, the FAS analysis of the primary estimand using the Chi-squared 
test was not considered methodologically adequate and the MAH was asked to focus the analysis on 
stratified analyses using the CMH test on the primary and main secondary outcomes including the 
Breslow-Day test to assess differences between chronic and recurrent pouchitis. Moreover, the 
imputation approach for the primary estimand including imputing missing data both as LOCF and non-
responder was considered suboptimal and a more comprehensive approach had been requested i.e. 
imputing missing data as non-responders comprehensive and a jump-to-reference imputation with 
tipping point analysis at least; however, other suitable methods could be proposed in addition.  
From a regulatory perspective in view of the criteria to be fulfilled in case of one pivotal trial, the lack 
of internal consistency between these pre-specified sub-populations was seen as concern overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 66/106 
 
 
 
questioning the generalizability of the benefit/risk to both subpopulations. To support the homogeneity 
of vedolizumab effect between strata the MAH provided results of CMH test including level of 
significance. Although a higher treatment effect was detected among recurrent as compared to chronic 
pouchitis patients, differences were not statistically significant. However, given the limited dataset and 
the small size of subgroups, the absence of a significant difference between the subpopulations could 
not be seen as conclusive on the comparability of the treatment effect.  
To justify the vedolizumab benefit for the claimed indication the MAH provided further analyses: these 
analyses confirmed a treatment difference for mPDAI remission of around 21% (statistically 
significant) at week 14 (primary endpoint), and of around 17-18% (statistically significant for the 
primary analysis) at week 34. 
The effect was confirmed for sustained mPDAI remission (20-21%), mPDAI response at week 14 
(25%), PDAI remission at week 14 (24%), and sustained PDAI remission (23%); conversely, 
treatment difference for mPDAI response at week 34 (15-16%) and PDAI remission at week 34 (17-
18%) were not statistically significant. Therefore, results confirmed a significant effect of vedolizumab 
on the primary estimand (mPDAI remission at week 14) as well as on the secondary endpoints mPDAI 
response week 14, sustained mPDAI remission, PDAI remission week 14, sustained PDAI remission. 
The MAH was asked to substantiate the clinical efficacy of vedolizumab in respect of clinical symptoms 
and endoscopic evaluation.  A comprehensive discussion of the expected clinical differences between 
the subpopulations was not performed but the chronic pouchitis population was considered as an 
unique population  differentiated between the two pouchitis groups by only referring to ‘the pattern of 
antibiotic usage’. Furthermore, the MAH did not discuss supportive evidence from published/literature 
data on vedolizumab benefit for the treatment of both pouchitis subtypes. Effect was mainly driven by 
endoscopic subscore (see below). 
The primary analysis is supported by results from two sensitivity analyses (LOCF and hybrid approach), 
while PPS analysis (delta 19.4, 95% CI 0.4, 37.4, p=0.064) and that accounting for concomitant use of 
antibiotics before week 14 (delta 15.7, 95% CI 0.7, 31.4, p=0.067) did not reach the statistical 
significance. Therefore, treatment with a concomitant antibiotic (excluding ciprofloxacin as companion) 
positively affected vedolizumab efficacy. 
The analysis of mPDAI clinical remission at W14 in some pre-defined subgroups showed inconsistent 
results, although the small sample size and the wide CI hamper any firm conclusion. Better results on 
mPDAI clinical remission at W14 were observed in the subgroup of severely active disease (difference 
of 22.2, 95% CI 2.3, 47.6) as compared to the moderate one (difference 18.2, 95% CI -3.9, 39.3); 
similar trend was seen at week 34 with an increased difference in treatment effect between groups 
(28.1 versus 8.6, respectively). It seems also that vedolizumab acts better for subgroups anti-TNF not 
used post-colectomy (vs anti-TNF failure) but also for anti-TNF experienced (UC or pouchitis) (vs anti-
TNF naïve). 
The MAH clarified that in more than two-thirds of patients in the study the anti-TNF were not used for 
pouchitis (75.9% in chronic stratum and 68.8% in recurrent stratum). Among patients naïve to anti-
TNF for pouchitis, mPDAI remission and PDAI remission treatment effects at W14 were higher in the 
recurrent compared to chronic subgroup. The same trend was seen at W34 only with mPDAI remission 
endpoint. In the small subgroup of patients with anti-TNF failure for pouchitis a heterogeneous 
response was seen between the two pouchitis subtypes and also at the two timepoints (W14 and 
W34), so no conclusion can be drawn. 
Different secondary endpoints, not controlled for multiplicity, were selected by MAH.  
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 67/106 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints: mPDAI remission rate was a secondary endpoint when measured at W34. At 
this longer time point a smaller difference in mPDAI remission rate was seen from placebo (delta of 17, 
CI 0.3-35, p=0.043) therefore showing a slight decrease up to 8 months (34 weeks) but overall the 
effect was maintained. Sensitivity analyses are supportive of this result however, as per week 14 
endpoint, PPS analysis was not (p=0.112). Remission rates at week 14 and 34 (both secondary 
endpoints) as measured by PDAI were consistent with the rates measured by using the mPDAI score, 
providing some reassurance on the use of mPDAI.  Same figure is seen for the sensitivity analyses. 
Results on PDAI clinical remission at W14 and week 34 on severe/moderate subgroup seem to have 
the same trend of those seen using mPDAI score but the very limited sample size (and very wide CI) 
somewhat hamper conclusions. Partial mPDAI response at W14 and W34 also showed better results 
with vedolizumab with a treatment difference of 29.4% and 21.6%, respectively; supported by the 
sensitivity analyses (except for Concomitant Antibiotic sensitivity analysis at W14 and PPS at W34). No 
difference between the placebo and vedolizumab groups were observed for mPDAI clinical remission, 
as well as for PDAI remission, in patients with baseline PMNL none/mild.  A revised indication 
statement clarifying that vedolizumab is intended for use in patients with moderately to severely active 
chronic pouchitis has been added which addresses the issue. 
As reported in the methods section, in order to rely on more robust data, the MAH was asked to 
perform a new analysis that accounts for multiple testing on the main secondary endpoints. Applying 
more conservative approaches like Bonferroni and Bonferroni stepdown (Holm), 4 of the 7 endpoints 
remain significant (PDAI remission W14, mPDAI response W14, Sustained mPDAI remission, and 
Sustained PDAI remission), whereas endpoints evaluated at week 34 (mPDAI remission, PDAI 
remission, mPDAI response) became not significant, in line with the jump-to-reference analysis, the 
further sensitivity analyses required and reported above. In the results of 2 other multiple testing 
approaches requested (Hochberg and Hommel), the p-values remained significant (<0.05) across all 7 
variables. 
Results from the composite Total PDAI score (change from baseline) favoured vedolizumab at W14 
(nominal p=0.025), however when the different PDAI domains were analysed, only the endoscopic 
subscore at week 14 showed a greater treatment difference in the vedolizumab group (not seen at 
week 34) therefore implying that results on the total score are mainly driven by the endoscopic 
subscore. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model has been requested on these results confirming 
that only for total PDAI and Endoscopic Inflammation scores the treatment effect was statistically 
significant.  
Importantly, results on QoL endpoints (IBDQ and CGQL) do not clearly support vedolizumab effect 
over placebo questioning the benefits of vedolizumab as perceived by the patients.  
Results by type of pouchitis from available secondary endpoints i.e. mPDAI 34 week, PDAI remission 
as well as in the partial mPDAI response at week 14 and 34 confirm those seen for the primary 
endpoint showing a greater response difference for vedolizumab over placebo group in the recurrent 
pouchitis group as compared to the chronic one. 
Exploratory endpoints: some selected endpoints evaluate histologic (RHI), endoscopic (SES-CD) 
scores other than PDAI score. The results of histologic endpoint (RHI) and endoscopic ulcer endpoints 
(number, surface, SES-CD) showed better results with vedolizumab compared to placebo. 
Of importance, results related to sustained mPDAI and PDAI remission (both at W14 and W34), 
clinically relevant endpoints, support a benefit of vedolizumab over placebo with a difference of 21.6 
pp (95% CI 6.5, 37.0) for sustained mPDAI remission and 23.5 pp (95% CI 8.0, 38.8) for sustained 
PDAI remission, therefore supporting a maintenance of the effect in terms of disease activity control 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 68/106 
 
 
 
with a clinically mindful effect size over placebo. However, a multiplicity analysis was performed 
confirming the robustness of the results.  
On the other hand, the biomarkers showed little (FC) or no improvement (CRP) with vedolizumab 
compared to placebo, not supporting their use as useful clinical measures of vedolizumab response.  
Time to relapse, as well as number of relapses, could be considered as an important endpoint for both 
types of pouchitis; however, the analysis found only a modest difference between the rates with 
vedolizumab (31.3%) and placebo (40%). The MAH has provided the Kaplan-Meier curves for time to 
relapse, both for overall population and for the subgroups of subjects classified as having recurrent or 
chronic pouchitis, these were not statistically significant between vedolizumab and placebo.  
Although the composite scores mPDAI and PDAI show better results with vedolizumab compared with 
placebo, analysis of change in PDAI components compared to baseline are inconsistent and total scores 
seems to be mainly driven by endoscopic subscore, raising concerns about the clinical relevance of the 
observed effect. The MAH has discussed the different pattern of ulceration seen at PDAI endoscopic 
(present at baseline in the 70.6% of placebo arm and 78.4% of vedolizumab arm) and PDAI histologic 
assessment (absent at baseline in 68.0% in the vedolizumab group and 64.7% in the placebo) 
concluding that the endoscopic evaluation represents the true level of ulceration in the pouch and that 
the difference in pattern of ulceration between endoscopic and histologic assessment is secondary to 
targeting biopsies at inflamed mucosa rather than at sites of ulceration. The endoscopic subscore 
drives the effect. Moreover, the baseline values for granularity and mucus exudates within the 
endoscopic subscore of PDAI have been provided.  
The clinical relevance of these results, considering that the current EMA GL highlights that clinically 
relevant effects in each of the main components of the PDAI score (symptoms as well as macro- and 
microscopic appearance of mucosa) is not supported by all components of the score but the endoscopic 
one is regarded as objective and clinically important.  
A favourable effect of vedolizumab seems to be exerted on corticosteroid-free mPDAI remission and 
corticosteroid-free PDAI remission rates at 14 week, the same figure is not seen at a longer time point 
(week 34) and it is referred to a small subset of subjects taking concomitant corticosteroids treatment 
at baseline (7.8% in the vedolizumab group and 13.7% in the placebo group on Day 1) making an 
specific claim not possible.   
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The use of vedolizumab for the treatment of pouchitis is sufficiently supported by available evidence and 
analyses as the estimand strategy provide confirmatory evidence of efficacy.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation of vedolizumab focuses on the analysis of safety results from Study 
Vedolizumab-4004 to establish whether the safety profile in pouchitis is similar to that observed in 
subjects with ulcerative cholitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). The safety data from Study 
Vedolizumab-4004 are supported by the extensive safety profile of vedolizumab IV through an 
Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) which includes phase 3 completed clinical studies in subjects with 
moderately to severely active UC or CD previously submitted to support marketing applications for 
these indication targets. This provides a comparison of safety between pouchitis and inflammatory

bowel disease (IBD) populations. Indeed, this submission is to support a new pouchitis indication and 
references combined safety data with vedolizumab IV in subjects with moderately to severely active 
UC or CD as previously provided in an ISS prepared in 2013.  
Study Vedolizumab-4004 (EARNEST) 
Study Vedolizumab-4004 (EARNEST) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab IV 300 mg over a 34-week treatment 
period (with the last dose at Week 30) in subjects who had a proctocolectomy and IPAA for UC, who 
had developed chronic or recurrent pouchitis. To participate in the study, adult subjects were required 
to have active pouchitis that inadequately responded to antibiotics; these subjects were randomized 
into treatment groups (vedolizumab IV 300 mg or placebo IV) based on pouchitis classification (chronic 
or recurrent).  
To date, Study Vedolizumab-4004 is the only placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety of 
vedolizumab IV in subjects with pouchitis. Efficacy endpoints included assessments of clinical 
remission, clinical response, quality of life, and improvement in clinical symptoms, endoscopic 
appearance, and pouch histopathology. 
The dosing and administration regimen of vedolizumab IV was consistent with that approved in the 
vedolizumab IV label for patients with UC and CD. Randomized subjects received study drug 
(vedolizumab IV 300 mg or placebo IV) at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, and 30. Final efficacy assessments 
were measured 4 weeks after the last study dose at Week 34 (W34), with a final safety follow-up visit 
at Week 48 (W48), 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug. All subjects were expected to complete 
a long-term follow-up safety survey by telephone, 26 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) 
The ISS presents an analysis of safety experience in 3326 subjects, i.e., 1279 subjects with UC; 1850 
subjects with CD; and 197 healthy subjects, who received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab IV. Of the 
total number of subjects in this analysis, 903 subjects, with either UC or CD, received ≥24 infusions 
with 4 weeks of follow-up, and 415 received ≥36 infusions with 4 weeks of follow-up. The focus of this 
ISS was the analysis of safety from the vedolizumab IV phase 3 program, which consisted of 3 
completed studies (Studies C13006, C13007, and C13011), in addition to interim data from an 
uncontrolled open-label extension (OLE) safety study (Study C13008): 
• 
Study C13006 was a pivotal, phase 3 study that demonstrated induction and maintenance 
efficacy of vedolizumab IV in the treatment of subjects with active UC. Subjects from the induction 
phase who achieved a clinical response at Week 6 were randomized to receive vedolizumab IV 300 mg 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W), or placebo Q4W starting at Week 6 and ending at 
Week 52. 
• 
Study C13007 was a pivotal, phase 3 study that demonstrated induction and maintenance 
efficacy of vedolizumab IV in the treatment of subjects with active CD. Subjects from the induction 
phase who achieved a clinical response at Week 6 were randomized to receive vedolizumab IV 300 mg 
Q4W or Q8W, or placebo Q4W starting at Week 6 and ending at Week 52. 
• 
Study C13011 was a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, multicenter study of 
the induction of clinical response and remission by vedolizumab IV in subjects with moderate to severe 
CD with prior failure of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists. 
• 
Study C13008 was an open-label, single-arm, long-term extension study where subjects were 
administered vedolizumab IV 300 mg Q4W to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy in subjects with 
UC or CD who rolled over from phase 3 studies C13006, C13007, and C13011 (including rollover from 
Assessment report

phase 2 studies C13002 and C13004 and de novo subjects). C13008 data contained in the ISS are 
from the interim clinical study report (CSR) (dated 14 March 2013) completed 4 years after study 
start. Cumulative adverse event (AE) and exposure data of this safety report are included from the 
final C13008 CSR (>8 years of vedolizumab IV exposure). 
The safety data from the phase 3 studies in the ISS (C13006 and C13007) and the OLE study 
(C13008) referenced in this safety evaluation (to provide context and aid the review of new safety data 
from Study Vedolizumab-4004) focuses specifically on the combined vedolizumab groups (Q4W and 
Q8W). The combined vedolizumab group includes subjects who responded to vedolizumab induction 
treatment and were randomized to receive double-blind vedolizumab Q4W or Q8W dosing in the 
maintenance phase; subjects who did not respond to vedolizumab induction treatment were assigned 
to open label vedolizumab Q4W dosing in the maintenance phase. This latter group provides important 
information on safety in subjects who may not respond initially to induction treatment but continue 
with vedolizumab treatment as they may respond with additional dosing. Thus, the combined 
vedolizumab group represents the range of subjects with moderately to severely active disease who 
may be administered vedolizumab in the clinic. 
Because vedolizumab IV is approved for use as a chronic treatment for UC and CD, the safety report 
makes specific reference to the safety data from Study C13006, and the combined safety data from 
Studies C13006 and C13007 presented in the ISS. In addition, this report makes specific reference to 
the safety data from the final CSR for OLE Study C13008.  
The established safety profile from the vedolizumab IV clinical program is reflected in approved 
product labeling for Entyvio (vedolizumab) for IV infusion. Since the launch of Entyvio (vedolizumab) 
for IV infusion, cumulative worldwide exposure (as of 31 March 2021) was approximately 722,703 
patient-years, with no new major safety issues identified to date from the postmarketing data (Risk 
Management Plan, Version 7.0). The postmarketing safety data was consistent with that summarized 
in the ISS. 
Patient exposure 
Vedolizumab-4004 
Per protocol, 6 IV infusions of study drug (vedolizumab IV 300 mg or placebo IV) were planned for all 
randomized  subjects  at  Weeks  0,  2,  6,  14,  22,  and  30.  The  duration  of  study  drug  exposure  was 
calculated as the total number of days on study drug (date of last dose - date of first dose + 1). For 
vedolizumab, the calculated duration of exposure accounts for 5 times the half-life of vedolizumab and, 
therefore, includes an additional 126 days (date of last dose - date of first dose + 1 + 126).  
All 6 planned infusions were administered to 32 of 51 subjects (62.7%) in the placebo group and 36 of 
51 subjects (70.6%) in the vedolizumab group. Of those subjects, 1 subject in the vedolizumab group 
was reported to have had 1 incomplete infusion at Week 2. Among subjects who received fewer than 6 
infusions, all study drug infusions were complete.  
The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 157.6 (76.43) days in the placebo group and 297.0 (69.80) 
days in the vedolizumab group, which accounted for the established vedolizumab half life. The maximum 
duration of exposure to vedolizumab was ≥48 weeks in 30 subjects (58.8%). In the placebo group, 31 
subjects (60.8%) were reported with a duration of exposure between 24 to <32 weeks, which included 
the planned duration of 30 weeks.

Reference IBD Studies 
The  ISS  presents  an  analysis  of  safety  experience  in  1434  subjects  (620  subjects  with  UC  and  814 
subjects with CD) who were administered vedolizumab IV 300 mg for up to a total of 52 weeks in the 
phase  3  studies,  C13006  and  C13007.  The  final  CSR  of  Study  C13008  presents  an  analysis  of  safety 
experience in 2243 subjects (894 subjects with UC and 1349 subjects with CD) who were administered 
vedolizumab IV 300 mg in OLE Study C13008 (C13008 final CSR).  
In  the  combined  vedolizumab  groups  of  Study  C13006  and  C13007,  287  subjects  and  312  subjects, 
respectively, completed all 14 planned infusions of vedolizumab IV in each study (ISS). In the final CSR 
of Study C13008, of the 2243 total subjects, 1350 (60%) completed ≥24 infusions (2 years of exposure), 
with a similar percentage of subjects with UC or CD (64% and 58%, respectively); more than half (52%) 
completed ≥36 infusions (3 years of exposure); and one-fourth (25%) completed ≥72 infusions (6 years 
of exposure). Five subjects (<1%) with UC received ≥116 infusions (≥9.5 years of exposure) (C13008 
Final CSR).  
The mean exposure (SD) to vedolizumab was 258.5 (117.98) and 246.8 (112.42) in Study C13006 and 
C13007,  respectively  (ISS),  and  1174.9  (887.57)  days  in  Study  C13008  (C13008  Final  CSR).  The 
reported duration of exposure takes the vedolizumab half-life into account. 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Disposition and Baseline Demographics 
A total of 102 subjects were randomized into Study Vedolizumab-4004 with even distribution to the 
placebo and vedolizumab-treated groups (51 subjects in each group). Overall, the baseline 
demographics were similar for subjects in the 2 treatment groups. The majority of subjects (70 
subjects [68.6%]) were male, 34 subjects (61.8%) were aged 35 to <65 years, and 86 subjects 
(87.8%) were white and 9 subjects (9.2%) were Asian. The means of weight and calculated body mass 
index were similar between treatment groups. Smoking, considered a risk factor for pouchitis, was 
reported in a total of 11 subjects (10.8%). 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 72/106 
 
 
 
 
Based on case report form (CRF)-reported data, 54 subjects (52.9%) were classified as having chronic 
pouchitis and 48 subjects (47.1%) as having recurrent pouchitis. 
Subjects were also required to have undergone proctocolectomy and IPAA that was completed at least 
12 months before the first dose of study drug. In the SAF, a mean of 11.5 years (range: 1.5 to 32.3 
years) had elapsed from IPAA to enrollment, with 65 subjects (63.7%) having ≥7 years since IPAA, 27 
subjects (26.5%), 3 to <7 years; and 10 subjects (9.8%), 1 to <3 years. The distribution of subjects 
was similar between vedolizumab and placebo-treated groups in each category. 
The distribution of subjects with anti-TNF exposure (pre- and postcolectomy), and reasons for anti-TNF 
failures postcolectomy, were well-balanced across treatment groups.

Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Infusion-Related Reactions 
As  with  any  biologic  therapy,  there  exists  the  potential  for  infusion-related  or  hypersensitivity  like 
reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions, including IRRs, were reported in 2 subjects (3.9%) in the placebo 
group and 3 subjects (5.9%) in the vedolizumab group. All events in this AESI category were considered 
by the investigator to be not related to study drug, with the exception of 1 subject in the vedolizumab 
group who experienced a related AESI of chest discomfort and recovered on the same day. The event 
was considered by the investigator to be mild in intensity, and the subject completed the study. There 
were no events specifically reported as IRRs. 
Liver Injury 
Liver injury AESIs were reported in 3 subjects (5.9%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (2.0%) in the 
vedolizumab group. One subject in the placebo-treated group experienced 3 related AESIs: increased 
aspartate  aminotransferase  increased,  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  and  gamma  glutamyl 
transferase increased. The events began after the subject had stopped study drug. In each case, the 
events were moderate in intensity; however, the events had not resolved at the time of the subject’s

last study visit. The AESI of hepatic enzyme increase in 1 subject in the vedolizumab treated group was 
assessed to be mild in intensity, and the subject recovered from the event during the study. 
Malignancies 
Two subjects (3.9%) in the placebo group (and none in the vedolizumab group) had AESIs of malignancy, 
including basal cell carcinoma and benign neoplasm of testis. The event of basal cell carcinoma began 
>30 days posttreatment. The event was considered to be an SAE. The subject had a previous medical 
history of basal cell carcinoma. The event of benign neoplasm of testis occurred >30 days posttreatment. 
The subject recovered from the event, and the investigator considered the event to be unrelated to study 
drug and mild in intensity. The subject discontinued study drug due to a separate drug-related TEAE of 
insomnia. 
Serious Infections 
One subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group (and none in the placebo group) experienced a serious 
infection AESI of gastroenteritis. The subject was hospitalized for observation and the event was reported 
as an SAE. The investigator considered the event to be not related to study drug and severe in intensity. 
The subject recovered from the event and completed the study.  
PML 
There were no cases of PML.  
Summary of AESIs 
Overall, there were no apparent trends or events that were of clinical concern among the AESIs reported 
in subjects with pouchitis. AESIs were consistent with those previously reported in the ISS in subjects 
with IBD.  
Exposure-Adjusted AEs 
Because  AE  rates  are  influenced  by  subject  duration  on  study,  exposure-adjusted  analyses  were 
performed to adjust for differences in overall exposure between treatment groups. Rates of AEs were 
expressed in terms of exposure-adjusted incidence rates (e.g., per 100 subject-years) to accommodate 
variable subject follow-up time. Incidence rates in both vedolizumab and placebo groups were similar 
(113.3 and 111.1 per 100 subject-years, respectively). 
TEAEs Related to a Flare 
The Table below reports an overview of TEAEs related to a flare in Study Vedolizumab-4004.  
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 80/106 
 
 
 
In  Study  Vedolizumab  4004,  at  least  1  TEAE  related  to  a  pouchitis  flare  was  reported  in  24  subjects 
(47.1%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  29  subjects  (56.9%)  in  the  vedolizumab  group.  Pouchitis  was  the 
most frequently reported PT related to a flare, reported in 19 subjects (37.3%) in the placebo group and 
24 subjects (47.1%) in the vedolizumab group. 
A total of 53 subjects reported a total of 83 TEAE events related to a flare, the majority of which (79 
events [95.2%]) were reported to be mild or moderate in intensity. TEAEs related to a flare that were 
considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  severe  in  intensity  were  reported  in  4  subjects,  with  2  in  each 
treatment group.  
A  higher  percentage  of  TEAEs  related  to  a  flare  (specifically  with  PT  of  pouchitis)  were  reported  in 
subjects  in  the  vedolizumab  group.  An  in-depth  review  of  the  TEAEs  related  to  a  flare  showed  that 
multiple episodes of pouchitis in a given subject was also higher in the vedolizumab group. One subject 
in the vedolizumab group had 5 episodes of pouchitis, 1 subject had 3 episodes, and 3 subjects had 2 
episodes each, whereas, in the placebo group, only 1 subject experienced 3 episodes of pouchitis and 
no  subjects  experienced  >3  episodes.  Among  events  reported  in  the  vedolizumab  group,  2  were 
considered  severe,  1  event  was  considered  treatment-related,  and  1  event  led  to  discontinuation  of 
treatment. Approximately half of the pouchitis events in the vedolizumab group occurred before Week 
14, and 6 events occurred after W34. No specific trends were observed between the time of treatment 
and onset of the event or the duration of the event. 
TEAEs related to a flare that were considered to be related to study drug were reported in 3 subjects 
(5.9%) in the placebo group and 1 subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group. One TEAE related to flare 
and related to study drug was reported in a. placebo-treated subject as an SAE and is described further 
in  the  SAE  section.  The  other  TEAEs  related  to  flare  and  considered  study  drug  related  are  briefly 
described as follows: 
-  A  TEAE  of  pouchitis  in  a  placebo-treated  subject  began  on  Day  33  and  was  assessed  as  related  to 
treatment. The subject withdrew from the study on Day 142 and the outcome of the. event was unknown. 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 81/106 
 
 
 
 
-  A  TEAE  of  arthralgia  in  a  placebo-treated  subject  began  on  Day  3  and  was  assessed  as  related  to 
treatment and severe in intensity. The subject discontinued study drug on Day 17 as. a result of the 
TEAE and recovered from the event on Day 61. The subject’s last visit occurred on Day 150. 
- A TEAE of pouchitis in a vedolizumab-treated subject began on Day 44 and was assessed as related to 
treatment and moderate in intensity. The subject recovered from the event on Day 47 and the subject 
completed the study on Day 332.  
TEAEs related to a flare that led to study drug discontinuation were reported in 2 subjects (3.9%) in the 
placebo group and 1 subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
SAEs in Study Vedolizumab-4004 are presented by SOC and PT in the Table below. 
Exposure-adjusted SAEs 
The incidence rate of SAEs was reported as 7.2 per 100 subject-years in the vedolizumab group and 
10.1 per 100 subject-years in the placebo group. Pouchitis was reported as 4.8 per 100 subject-years 
in the vedolizumab group and 2.5 per 100 subject-years in the placebo group.   
SAEs Related to a Flare 
SAEs related to a flare are presented in the Table below. 
Assessment report

Serious PTEs 
One subject (2.0%) in the placebo group experienced a serious PTE (pre-treatment events) of pyrexia 
before administration of study drug. The event was considered by the investigator to be related to a 
pouchitis flare and was described as being severe in intensity. The subject recovered from the event 
prior to first administration of study drug. 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in Study Vedolizumab-4004. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters were noted in Study Vedolizumab-
4004.  
Serum chemistry 
No clinically significant differences between the treatment groups in mean changes from baseline at 
any time point were observed for any chemistry parameter. 
Hematology 
No clinically significant differences between the treatment groups in mean changes from baseline at 
any time point were observed for any hematology parameter.  
Urinalysis 
No clinically significant differences between the treatment groups in mean changes from baseline at 
any time point were observed for any urinalysis parameter. 
Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities 
A laboratory value was considered markedly abnormal if it met the predefined criteria. Few subjects 
met the criteria for a marked laboratory abnormality. The most common marked laboratory 
abnormality was high GGT. During treatment, high GGT was observed in 5 subjects (9.8%) in the 
placebo group and 3 subjects (5.9%) in the vedolizumab group. No apparent clinically significant 
trends were observed. 
Vital signs 
Assessment report

No clinically significant findings were noted regarding mean changes from baseline in vital signs, 
including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and body weight. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was not specifically evaluated in Study Vedolizumab-4004. Antibodies to vedolizumab 
may develop during vedolizumab treatment, most of which are neutralizing. IRRs after vedolizumab 
infusion have been reported in subjects with anti-vedolizumab antibodies. The immunogenicity of 
vedolizumab IV has been evaluated in patients with IBD; the immunogenicity profile is reflected in the 
approved product labeling for Entyvio (vedolizumab) for IV infusion. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety in special groups and situations was not specifically studied.  
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
The safety of vedolizumab in pregnant or lactating women has not been evaluated in clinical studies. 
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, one subject in the vedolizumab group experienced a pregnancy during 
the study, which was confirmed by a urine test on Day 197. On the same day, the subject underwent 
an elective termination and recovered from the event on Day 200. The subject completed the study on 
Day 346. 
Overdose 
No information on overdose became available during the clinical development of vedolizumab IV. There 
were no reports of overdose in the clinical study setting.  
Drug Abuse 
The potential for abuse and dependence with vedolizumab has not been evaluated in clinical studies. 
There were no reports of abuse in the clinical study setting. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
The potential for AEs related to withdrawal and rebound was not assessed. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No specific data were collected during clinical development to assess the impact of vedolizumab on the 
ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific interaction or pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with pouchitis. In 
Study Vedolizumab-4004 vedolizumab has been co-administered with antibiotics. The 
pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab is expected to be similar to that in patients with moderate to 
severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated accordingly  
Discontinuation due to adverse events

Post marketing experience 
Vedolizumab has been marketed since 2014 and is approved for UC and CD in over 70 countries. Since 
the launch of Entyvio (vedolizumab) for IV infusion, cumulative worldwide patient exposure as of 31 
March 2021 was approximately 722,703 patient-years and no new major safety issues have been 
identified to date from the postmarketing data (Risk Management Plan, Version 7.0)  
The MAH stated that i) the safety of vedolizumab has been well-characterized from postmarketing 
data; the recent periodic benefit-risk evaluation report (PBRER) did not identify any new safety 
concerns, and the safety data was found to be consistent with the known safety profile of the drug. ii) 
There were no new trends or changes in clinical importance seen for IRRs, infections, malignancies, or 
hepatic events, and no cases of PML were reported. iii) The current risk mitigation measures provide 
sufficient information to allow for the safe use of vedolizumab. iv) In addition, ongoing studies will 
provide additional information to further characterize risks and address missing information. v) The 
safety profile of vedolizumab is well established, and the overall benefit-risk profile for vedolizumab 
continues to remain positive. vi) Literature searches revealed no significant safety findings associated 
with vedolizumab IV in patients with pouchitis. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  evaluation  of  vedolizumab  is  based  on  data  obtained  from  Study  Vedolizumab-4004  (the 
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 85/106 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vedolizumab IV 300 mg over a 34-week treatment period in subjects who had a proctocolectomy and 
IPAA for ulcerative cholitis [UC], who had developed chronic or recurrent pouchitis) and supported by 
the  Integrated  Safety  of  Summary  (ISS)  which  includes  phase  3  completed  clinical  studies  (Studies 
C13006,  C13007,  and  C13011)  in  subjects  with  moderately  to  severely  active  UC  or  Chron’s  Disease 
(CD) previously submitted for the marketing applications for these indication targets. In addition, interim 
data  (dated  14  March  2013)  from  an  uncontrolled  open-label  extension  (OLE)  safety  study  (Study 
C13008), including subjects with UC or CD who rolled over from phase 3 studies C13006, C13007, and 
C13011, were taken into account.  
This safety dataset is considered acceptable and appropriate, because it provides a comparison of safety 
between  pouchitis  and  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD)  populations  to  establish  whether  the  safety 
profile in subjects with pouchitis is similar to that observed in subjects with UC and CD.  
Besides  the  patients  enrolled  in  Study  Vedolizumab-4004,  the  ISS  presents  an  analysis  of  safety 
experience  in  3326  subjects,  i.e.,  1279  subjects  with  UC;  1850  subjects  with  CD;  and  197  healthy 
subjects, who received at least 1 dose of vedolizumab IV. Of the total number of subjects in this analysis, 
903 subjects, with either UC or CD, received ≥24 infusions with 4 weeks of follow-up, and 415 received 
≥36 infusions with 4 weeks of follow-up.  
IV infusion of study drug was completed in 36 of 51 subjects (70.6%) in the vedolizumab group. One 
subject in the vedolizumab group received an incomplete infusion. However, the safety data from Study 
Vedolizumab-4004 are supported by phase 3 completed clinical studies in subjects with moderately to 
severely active UC or CD previously submitted to support marketing applications for these indications. 
Therefore, the overall size of the safety database can be considered sufficient for the assessment and 
adequate for regulatory purposes. 
Exposure 
In the Vedolizumab-4004 Study, overall, the treatment with all 6 IV infusion of study drug (vedolizumab 
IV 300 mg or placebo IV) at Week 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, and 30) were administered to 36/51 (70.6%) subjects 
in  the  vedolizumab  group  and  32/51  (62.7%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (1  of  the  vedolizumab 
subjects had 1 incomplete infusion at Week 2).  
The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  exposure  is  considered  adequate  (297.0  [69.80]  days  [approximately  10 
months  in  the  vedolizumab  group]  and  157.6  [76.43]  days  [approximately  5  months]  in  the  placebo 
group) and the majority of subjects (58.8%) had the maximum duration of exposure to vedolizumab 
(≥48 weeks).  
Concerning the reference IBD studies as comparison, vedolizumab IV 300 mg for up a total of 52 weeks 
(approximately, 13 months) was administered to 1434 subjects (620 with UC and 814 with CD) in the 
phase studies C13006 and C13007 and 2243 subjects (894 with UC and 1349 with CD) in the OLE study 
C13008. In the OLE study C13008, 1350 subjects (60%) completed ≥24 infusions (2 years of exposure); 
52% of subjects completed ≥36 infusions (3 years); 25% of subjects completed ≥72 infusions (6 years). 
Only  5  subjects  (<1%)  with  UC  received  ≥116  infusions  (≥9.5  years).  The  mean  exposure  (SD)  to 
vedolizumab  was  258.5  (117.98)  (approximately  8.5  months)  and  246.8  (112.42)  (approximately  8 
months)  in  Study  C13006  and  C13007,  respectively  (ISS)  -therefore,  comparable  with  the  mean 
exposure  to  vedolizumab  in  Study  Vedolizumab-4004-,  and  1174.9  (887.57)  days  (approximately  39 
months [i.e., around 3 years]) in Study C13008. 
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, a total of 102 subjects (51 in vedolizumab and placebo groups each) were 
enrolled.  Baseline  and  demographic  characteristics  were  overall  balanced  between  the  two 
treatment groups. The mean (SD) age was 41.9 (12.44) years (40.8 years in the vedolizumab group vs. 
42.9 years in the placebo group) with a range from 19 to 68 years. The majority of patients (61.8%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 86/106 
 
 
 
was aged 25 to <65 years. 54 (approximately 53%) and 48 (approximately 47%) subjects were classified 
as having chronic and recurrent pouchitis, respectively. A mean of 11.5 years (range: 1.5 to 32.3 years) 
had  elapsed  from  IPAA  to  enrollment.  The  distribution  of  subjects  with  anti-TNF  exposure  (pre-  and 
postcolectomy), and reasons for anti-TNF failures postcolectomy, were overall balanced across treatment 
groups. 
Adverse events 
Overall, in Study Vedolizumab-4004, around 92% of patients treated with vedolizumab experienced at 
least 1 TEAEs compared with approximately 86% of subjects receiving placebo. 
In  the  comparison  with  UC/CD  patient  populations,  AEs  of  any  type  and  severity  were  reported  less 
frequently in the pouchitis group than in the UC study C13006, the combined UC/CD studies C13006 and 
C13007, and the combined UC/CD OLE study C13008 (drug-related AEs: 24% vs. 32%, 36%, and 44%, 
respectively; AEs leading to discontinuation: 2% vs. 6%, 9%, 16%; SAEs: 6% vs. 12%, 19%, 37%; 
serious  infection  AEs:  2%  vs.  2%,  4%,  9%;  drug-related  SAEs:  0  vs.  2%,  3%,  5%;  SAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation: 0 vs. 3%, 5%, 9%; deaths: 0 vs. <1% for the remaining groups).   
No significant differences were observed when comparing the overall exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
between Study Vedolizumab-4004 and Study C13008.  
Common AEs 
The SOC with the higher frequency of TEAEs in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group 
were GI disorders (70.6% vs. 62.7%; with pouchitis being the most frequent AE in this SOC: 47.1% 
[n=24] vs. 39.2% [n=20]); Infections and Infestations (47.1% vs. 29.4%; with nasopharyngitis being 
the  most  frequently  reported  AE  in  this  SOC:  6  subjects  in  each  treatment  group);  Nervous  system 
disorder (29.4% vs. 9.8%; with headache being the most frequent AE in this SOC: 19.6% [n=10] vs. 
5.9% [n=3]); Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (9.8% vs. 3.9%); Eye disorders (9.8% vs. 
2.0%); Blood and lymphatic system disorders (7.8% vs. 2.0%).    
Overall, pouchitis (reported as related to a flare or worsening of pouchitis) was the most frequent TEAE 
occurring in a higher number of subjects (24, [47.1%]) in the vedolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group (20 subjects [39.2%]) suggesting a potential loss of efficacy. The other most frequent 
TEAEs  in  the  vedolizumab  group  were  (in  order  of  frequency  by  the  percentage  of  subjects  who 
experienced the event): headache, arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, 
influenza, frequent bowel movement, and abdominal pain.  
TEAEs occurring more frequently with vedolizumab treatment as compared to placebo and occurring in 
at least ≥4% of subjects in the vedolizumab group (in order of frequency) were pouchitis -as mentioned 
above-, headache (19.6% [n=10] vs. 5.9% [n=3]), upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% [n=5] vs. 
2.0% [n=1]), abdominal pain (7.8% vs. 5.9%), influenza (7.8% [n=4] vs. 2.0% [n=1]), and frequent 
bowel movements (7.8% [n=4] vs. 3.9% [n=2]).  
Other AEs which occurred in the vedolizumab group in at least 2 subjects (3.9%) versus none in the 
placebo  group  were:  anaemia,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  rectal  hemorrhage,  musculoskeletal 
pain, asthenia, and chest discomfort (for all, 3.9% [n=2] vs. 0). 
In  the  comparison  with  UC/CD  patient  populations,  AEs  of  any  type  and  severity  were  reported  less 
frequently in the pouchitis group than in the UC study C13006, the combined UC/CD studies C13006 and 
C13007,  and  the  combined  UC/CD  OLE  study  C1300.  The  overall  summary  of  TEAEs  by  SOC  in 
Vedolizumab-4004 were consistent with those presented in the ISS in subjects with IBD. As would be 
expected in subjects with pouchitis or IBD, GI disorders were the most frequently reported TEAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 87/106 
 
 
 
Although in terms of most frequent AEs, the safety profile of vedolizumab in the pouchitis group is overall 
similar to that reported for the other indications, there are some TEAEs that occurred more frequently 
with  vedolizumab  treatment  as  compared  to  placebo  such  as  abdominal  pain  and  frequent  bowel 
movements (with a difference of approximately 2% and 4%, respectively), which are not reported in the 
section 4.8 of the current SmPC. As requested, the MAH made a thorough review of the AEs abdominal 
pain  and  bowel  movements.  The  difference  in  terms  of  absolute  numbers  between  vedolizumab  and 
placebo group was of 1 subject (4 vs. 3) for  “abdominal pain” and of 2 subjects (4 vs. 2) for “bowel 
movements”. Given the small number of patients included in the study even an apparent small difference 
can  become  clinically  relevant;  it  is  however  acknowledged  that  all  events  in  the  vedolizumab  group 
were reported as nonserious, mild or moderate in intensity, not considered related to study drug with 
the majority of them having a relatively short duration and resolving. Furthermore, most of the subjects 
with “abdominal pain” had also received multiple concomitant medications during the time of the event 
that  could  have  contributed  to  abdominal  pain.  Regarding  “bowel  movements”,  all  events  in  the 
vedolizumab  group  recovered  in  the  timeframe  from  4  to  66  days  before  the  end  of  the  study; 
furthermore,  as  for  “abdominal  pain”,  concomitant  medications  could  have  contributed  to  the  event. 
Neither  “abdominal  pain”  nor  “bowel  movements”  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  No  significant 
differences  in  the  observed  clinical  characteristics  between  subjects  in  either  treatment  groups  were 
found.  The  MAH  pointed  out  that  these  two  symptoms  could  be  related  to  the  underlying  disease 
(pouchitis), particularly because none of the subjects were in remission at the moment when these AEs 
occurred.  This  could  be  agreed.  It  is  noted  that  other  ADRs  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC, 
particularly in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders, can be due to the underlying diseases. PTs included 
in the ADR Table in section 4.8 of the SmPC under the SOC Grastrointestinal disorders, such as abdominal 
distension,  dyspepsia,  constipation,  flatulence,  can  include  abdominal  pain  and  bowel  movements  as 
symptoms. In conclusion, given the above, the MAH did not consider that inclusion of abdominal pain 
and bowel movements in Section 4.8 of the SmPC was warranted as there was insufficient evidence to 
establish  a  strong  causal  association  between  the  events  and  vedolizumab.  Overall,  this  was  agreed 
particularly due to the small difference in the incidence of these AEs between vedolizumab and placebo 
groups,  the  absence  of  remarkable  differences  in  the  characteristics  of  these  AEs  between  the  two 
treatment  groups,  and  the  multiple  concomitant  medications  during  the  time  of  the  event  that  could 
have contributed to their occurrence.   
Other AEs which occurred in the vedolizumab group in at least 2 subjects (3.9%) versus none in the 
placebo  group  were:  anaemia,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  rectal  hemorrhage,  musculoskeletal 
pain, asthenia, and chest discomfort (for all, 3.9% [n=2] vs. 0). Therefore, for the above-mentioned 
AEs, the MAH was required to discuss whether they (or at least some of them) could be due to lack of 
efficacy  and  whether they  should  have  been  added in  the  ADR  table  of  the 4.8  section  of  the  SmPC. 
Based  on  the  analyses  made  by  the  MAH,  most  of  these  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity, 
nonserious, recovered, did not lead to discontinuation, and were not considered related to study drug 
by  the  investigator.  For  some  of  these  events  (i.e.,  anaemia,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  and 
musculoskeletal  pain),  a  conclusion  on  the  causal  relationship  with  vedolizumab  treatment  cannot  be 
drawn. For the remaining AEs: a) in the absence of confounding factors, the MAH was asked to include 
rectal hemorrhage AEs, which were not even associated with pouchitis events or the absence of remission 
status, in the ADR Table in section 4.8 of the SmPC; b) in the presence of a clear temporal relationship 
with  IRR,  asthenia  and  chest  discomfort  were  requested  to  be included  in  the  already  existing  list  of 
signs  and  symptoms  of  infusion-related  reactions  reported  under  the  SOC  General  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions  in  the  table  of  section  4.8  and  asthenia  should  have  been  included  for 
consistency in the new text of the subsection “Infusion-related reactions” (see below the Discussion on 
the AESIs). The MAH agreed and implemented these changes to the PI. 
Assessment report

In order to better understand the safety profile of vedolizumab in different subgroup populations, the 
MAH was asked to provide safety data in terms of AEs, AESIs, SAEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, stratified by: a) chronic vs. recurrent pouchitis; b) anti-TNFalfa naïve vs. experienced 
status,  c)  baseline  clinical  severity,  d)  concomitant  use  of  antibiotics  excluding  ciprofloxacin  as 
companion  (first  4  weeks).  Based  on  the  data  submitted  by  the  MAH,  given  the  small  numbers, 
conclusions from these subgroup analyses are limited. More AEs occurred in subjects who were anti-TNF 
naïve, had severely active pouchitis at baseline, and who did not use any concomitant antibiotics before 
W34,  with  a  higher  frequency  of  SAE  in  the  recurrent  pouchitis  subgroup  compared  with  the  chronic 
subgroup. However, no relevant difference vedolizumab and placebo arms were observed.  
The majority of the AEs reported in the Vedolizumab-4004 Study was mild or moderate in intensity in 
both treatment groups (mild: vedolizumab 29.4% vs. placebo 21.6%; moderate: 56% vs. 54.9%). A 
lower  proportion  of  vedolizumab-treated  patients  experienced  a  TEAE  that  was  considered  by  the 
investigator to be severe in intensity (5.9% [n=3] vs. 9.8% [n=5] in the placebo group). Most severe 
TEAEs occurred in the GI disorders SOC (6 subjects, 5.9%) with pouchitis (reported as related to a flare 
or worsening of pouchitis) being the most common severe TEAE, reported in 1 subject (2.0%) in the 
placebo  group  and  2  subjects  (3.9%)  in  the  vedolizumab  group,  as  mentioned  above.  The  pouchitis 
event  occurred  in  the  placebo  group  was  considered  as  a  SAE  and  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the 
investigator while the 2 severe events of pouchitis occurred in the vedolizumab groups were not deemed 
to be drug-related and only 1 was considered to be a SAE.   
Severe events reported in the IBD studies occurred only within the GI disorders SOC and included events 
of CD, abdominal pain, and colitis ulcerative. 
Drug-related AEs 
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, drug-related TEAEs were reported with a slightly higher frequency in the 
vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group (23.5% [n=12] vs. 21.6% [n=11]), in particular, 
in the SOC Infections and Infestations (15.7% [n=8] vs. 7.8% [n=4]). In this SOC, the following drug-
related AEs occurred more frequently in the vedolizumab group: nasopharyngitis (5.9% [n=3] vs. 2.0% 
[n=1]), upper respiratory tract infection (3.9% [n=2] vs. 0). These AEs are already listed in the ADR 
Table  of  the  SmPC  section  4.8.  The  AEs  of  pouchitis  were  reported  as  drug-related  in  only  1  (2.0%) 
subject treated with vedolizumab and in 2 (3.9%) subjects receiving placebo.   
The same was also observed in subjects with IBD, where the majority of drug-related AEs were reported 
within the SOC of infections and infestations (ISS). 
AESIs 
AESI categories were predefined in the protocol of Study Vedolizumab-4004, based on the mechanism 
of  action  of  vedolizumab  and  the  known  safety  profile.  The  5  AESI  categories  are  hypersensitivity 
reactions including IRRs, PML, liver injury, malignancies, and serious infections. A total of 16 AESI events 
were reported with a lower proportion in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group (9.8% 
[n=6] vs. 13.7% [n=10]), which is reassuring.  
Most frequently reported AESIs were hypersensitivity reactions including IRRs that occurred in 3 
subjects (5.9%) in the vedolizumab group and in 2 subjects (3.9%) in the placebo group. None of these 
events  were  specifically  reported  as  IRRs.  All  events  in  this  AESI  category  were  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  not  related  to  study  drug,  with  the  exception  of  an  event  of  chest  discomfort, 
considered  related  to  study  drug  and  mild in intensity,  that  occurred in  1  subject  in  the  vedolizumab 
group. The event occurred on Day 155 and was reported as recovered on the same day; the subject 
completed the study on Day 339.  
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 89/106 
 
 
 
Liver  injury  AESIs  were  reported  in  1  subject  (2.0%)  in  the  vedolizumab  group  and  in  3  subjects 
(5.9%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  AESI  of  hepatic  enzyme  increase  in  1  subject  in  the  vedolizumab 
treated group was assessed to be mild in intensity, and the subject recovered from the event during the 
study.  
AESIs  of malignancies  were  reported  in  2  subjects  (3.9%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  in  none  in  the 
vedolizumab group, including basal cell carcinoma and benign neoplasm of testis.  
Regarding  serious  infections,  1  subject  (2.0%)  in  the  vedolizumab  group  (and  none  in  the  placebo 
group)  experienced  a  serious  infection  AESI  of  gastroenteritis.  The  subject  was  hospitalized  for 
observation, recovered from the event and completed the study; the event was reported as a SAE and 
the investigator considered it to be not related to study drug and severe in intensity.  
No cases of PML were reported. 
It is acknowledged that, overall, there were no apparent trends or events that were of clinical concern 
among  the  AESIs  reported  in  subjects  with  pouchitis  treated  with  vedolizumab.  AESIs  seems  to  be 
consistent with those previously reported in the ISS in subjects with IBD. However, in  the section 4.8 
of the SmPC, the MAH was asked to update the paragraph on “Description of selected adverse reactions” 
with the specific results of the Study Vedolizumab-4004. As requested, the MAH agrees to the addition 
of AESI information from Study Vedolizumab-4004 to section 4.8 of the SmPC. New text has been added 
to the subsections “Infusion-related reactions” and “Infections”. IRRs were reported in 3 subjects (5.9%) 
in the vedolizumab group and in 2 subjects (3.9%) in the placebo group. The individual PTs included 
mouth ulceration, swelling, oedema peripheral, chest discomfort, acute kidney injury, obstructive airway 
disorder and flushing. All events were mild to moderate in intensity, nonserious, did not lead to study 
discontinuation, and were considered not related to study drug by the investigator except for one event 
of chest discomfort. The wording of the new text can be considered acceptable, however, as mentioned 
above, there were 3 AEs of asthenia reported in 2 vedolizumab subjects occurred during drug infusions. 
Given the temporal relationship with the vedolizumab infusion in terms of onset and duration, the MAH 
pointed out that these events were most likely an infusion-related reaction consistent with the known 
ADR  of  vedolizumab.  The  causality  is  likely  and,  therefore,  as  mentioned  above,  the  MAH  agreed  to 
include asthenia in the new text of the SmPC 4.8. subsection “Infusion-related reactions”. 
The new text in the subsection “Infections” can be considered acceptable outlining that a serious infection 
of AESI was reported in 1 subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group and in none in the placebo group. 
The subject was hospitalized and the event was severe in intensity, not considered related to study drug 
by  the investigator,  and  recovered.  The  MAH  specified  that in  Study  Vedolizumab-4004  there  was  no 
trend of infections in relation to BMI and no higher risk of infections in patients who had prior exposure 
to TNF-alfa antagonist therapy. Therefore, the current statement in the SmPC is referred only to UC and 
CD studies and not to pouchitis. This is acceptable. 
No changes were necessary for the text of the subsection “Malignancies”. 
Exposure-adjusted  analyses  were  performed  to  adjust  for  differences  in  overall  exposure  between 
treatment groups. Overall, exposure-adjusted incidence rates in both vedolizumab and placebo groups 
were  similar  (113.3  and  111.1  per  100  subject-years,  respectively).  However,  differences  persisted 
between the treatment groups in terms of a higher incidence rates in the vedolizumab group compared 
with the placebo group of the following AEs: pouchitis (57.8 per 100 subject-years [n=24] vs. 50.5 per 
100  subjects-years  [n=20]),  headache  (24.1  [n=10]  vs.  7.6  [n=3]),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(12.0  [n=5]  vs.  2.5  [n=1]),  influenza  and  frequent  bowel  movements  (for  both,  9.6  [n=4]  vs.  2.5 
[n=1]), anaemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, rectal hemorrhage, asthenia, chest discomfort, and 
musculoskeletal  pain  (for  all,  4.8  [n=2]  vs.  0).  As  reported  above  the  MAH  provided  the  requested 
Assessment report

clarifications and included rectal hemorrhage, asthenia, chest discomfort in  section 4.8 of the SmPC as 
requested.   
TEAEs Related to a Flare 
A total of 53 subjects reported 83 TEAE events related to a flare; as mentioned above, at least 1 TEAE 
related to a pouchitis flare was reported in a higher proportion of patients treated with vedolizumab than 
in the placebo group (56.9% [n=29] vs. 47.1% [n=24]). Pouchitis was the most frequently reported PT 
related to a flare and with a higher frequency in vedolizumab subjects (47.1% [n=24] vs. 37.3% [n=19] 
in the placebo group).  
Multiple episodes of pouchitis in a given subject was also higher in the vedolizumab group. One subject 
in the vedolizumab group had 5 episodes of pouchitis, 1 subject had 3 episodes, and 3 subjects had 2 
episodes each, whereas, in the placebo group, only 1 subject experienced 3 episodes of pouchitis and 
no  subjects  experienced  >3  episodes.  Among  events  reported  in  the  vedolizumab  group,  2  were 
considered  severe,  1  event  was  considered  treatment-related,  and  1  event  led  to  discontinuation  of 
treatment. Approximately half of the pouchitis events in the vedolizumab group occurred before Week 
14,  and  6  events  occurred  after  Week  34.  No  specific  trends  were  observed  between  the  time  of 
treatment and onset of the event or the duration of the event. 
The majority of TEAEs related to flare (79 events [95.2%]) were reported to be mild (25.5% [n=13] in 
the vedolizumab group vs. 7.8%. [n=4] in the placebo group) or moderate (27.5% [n=14] vs. 35.3% 
[n=18]) in intensity; severe events were reported in 4 subjects, with 2 in each treatment group. TEAEs 
related to flare were considered related to study drug in only 1 (2.0%) subject in the vedolizumab group 
and in 3 (5.9%) subjects receiving placebo. The TEAE of pouchitis in the vedolizumab-treated subject 
began  on  Day  44  and  was  assessed  as  related  to  treatment  and  moderate  in  intensity;  the  subject 
recovered from the event on Day 47 and completed the study on Day 332. One TEAE related to flare 
and related to study drug was reported in a placebo-treated subject as a SAE and is described further in 
the SAE section, herein.  
TEAEs  related  to  flare  that  led  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  1  (2.0%)  vedolizumab  subject  and  in  2 
(3.9%) placebo subjects.  
SAEs 
A slightly lower proportion of SAEs was reported in patients treated with vedolizumab compared with 
placebo  (5.9%  [n=3]  vs.  7.8%  [n=4]).  Pouchitis  was  the  SAE  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
vedolizumab  group  (3.9%  [n=2]  vs.  2.0%  [n=1]),  however,  only  the  event  occurred  in  the  placebo 
group was considered related to study drug by the investigators. One vedolizumab patient had a SAE of 
gastroenteritis. No SAEs led to study drug discontinuation. 
Two SAEs (basal cell carcinoma in the placebo group and gastroenteritis in the vedolizumab group) were 
also reported as AESIs under the categories of malignancies and serious infections, respectively. 
Consistent  with  underlying  disease,  the  majority  of  SAEs  were  reported  within  the  GI  disorders  SOC, 
reported in a total of 5 of 7 subjects (4.9%). This is also consistent with the SAEs observed in the IBD 
populations where Crohn’s disease, colitis ulcerative, and anal abscess were among the most frequently 
reported SAEs, consistent with the underlying conditions in the IBD populations.  
The  incidence  rate  of  SAEs  was  reported  as 7.2  per  100  subject-years in the vedolizumab  group  and 
10.1 per 100 subject-years in the placebo group. Pouchitis was reported as 4.8 per 100 subject-years in 
the vedolizumab group and 2.5 per 100 subject-years in the placebo group.   
SAE related to flare 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 91/106 
 
 
 
Regarding the SAE related to a flare, the 2 subjects experiencing events of pouchitis in the vedolizumab 
group,  which  was  not  considered  related  to  study  drug,  were  both  hospitalized  due  to  worsening  of 
pouchitis.  
In particular, one subject was hospitalized on Day 8; the event was also considered severe in intensity 
and recovered on Day 14; the subject discontinued study drug on Day 43 due to lack of efficacy and 
attended the end of study visit on Day 347. The second subject was hospitalized on Day 48 after the 
subject had discontinued study drug on Day 43 due to worsening pouchitis that was considered moderate 
in intensity; the subject recovered from the event on Day 62 and completed an end of study visit on Day 
72.     
Regarding  the  event  of  pouchitis  in  the  placebo-treated  subject,  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
related to study drug and severe in intensity, it began on Day 68 (>30 days posttreatment); the subject 
was hospitalized for a laparotomy ileostomy, recovered from the event on Day 76 and attended the end 
of study visit on Day 272.  
Taking into account the details of the narratives of the pouchitis SAEs occurred in Study Vedolizumab-
4004, it seems that, overall, there are not specific differences between the event occurred in the placebo 
group and those occurred in the vedolizumab group. Both vedolizumab subjects discontinued the study 
drug.  Furthernore,  as  mentioned  above,  pouchitis  (reported  as  related  to  a  flare  or  worsening  of 
pouchitis)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  occurring  in  a  higher  proportion  of  vedolizumab-
treated patients compared with the placebo group (47.1% [n=24] vs. 39.2% [n=20], with a difference 
of 7.9%), even though the majority of the events was of mild to moderate intensity. Given the above, 
i) the MAH was requested to provide information on the proportion of AEs of pouchitis which recovered 
and  those  which did not  and  the  proportion of  pouchitis  events  that needed  additional treatments  by 
severity intensity and by treatment groups. ii) Although vedolizumab is proposed for the treatment of 
pouchitis, the MAH was asked to elaborate on whether there is a possible biological rationale that this 
drug might exacerbate the pre-existing pouchitis or whether all the pouchitis events in terms of flare of 
pouchitis or worsening of the pre-esisting pouchitis, could be definitely considered as a consequence of 
lack of efficacy. iii) The MAH was requested to consider to include flare and worsening of pouchitis in the 
ADR Table of the SmPC section 4.8 with a corresponding warning in section 4.4. The MAH presented the 
requested  data  and  discussion  and based  on  i)  the  absence  of  clinically  relevant  differences  between 
vedolizumab  and  placebo  treatment  groups  in  terms  of  pouchitis  event  outcome  and  the  need  of 
additional treatment; ii) the unlikelihood of vedolizumab causing exacerbation of pouchitis on the basis 
of its mechanism of action; iii) the absence of evident relationship between the occurrence of pouchitis 
events and achievement of mPDAI remission; and iv) the absence of relevant differences in terms of 
demographics  and  clinical  characteristics  between  patients  with  and  without  pouchitis  events,  it  was 
agreed  with  the  MAH  that  there  was  no  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude  for  the  inclusion  of  flare  and 
worsening of pouchitis in section 4.8 or as a warning in section 4.4. 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in Study Vedolizumab-4004. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters were noted in Study Vedolizumab-4004.  
Few subjects met the criteria for a marked laboratory abnormality. The most common marked laboratory 
abnormality was high GGT that was observed in 5 subjects (9.8%) in the placebo group and 3 subjects 
(5.9%) in the vedolizumab group. No apparent clinically significant trends were observed. 
Regarding immunogenicity, it was not specifically evaluated in Study Vedolizumab-4004. Antibodies to 
vedolizumab  may  develop  during  vedolizumab  treatment,  most  of  which  are  neutralizing.  IRRs  after 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 92/106 
 
 
 
vedolizumab  infusion  have  been  reported  in  subjects  with  anti-vedolizumab  antibodies.  The 
immunogenicity of vedolizumab IV has been evaluated in patients with IBD; the immunogenicity profile 
is  reflected  in  the  approved  product  labeling  for  Entyvio  (vedolizumab)  for  IV  infusion,  which  is 
acceptable. 
Special populations 
Safety in special populations was not specifically studied.  
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, the mean (SD) age was 41.9 (12.44) years (40.8 years in the vedolizumab 
group vs. 42.9 years in the placebo group) with a range from 19 to 68 years. The majority of patients 
(61.8%)  was  aged  25  to  <65  years.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  clarify  whether  differences  in  safety  of 
vedolizumab were observed by age categories between the treatment groups. The comparison by age 
categories had to be performed also with the data coming from the ISS on IBD. The same analyses by 
gender and race/ethnicity were requested. Based on the submitted data, it is agreed with the MAH that 
the assessments of safety by age categories (<25, 25 to 65, and >65 years), gender, race, and ethnicity 
are limited by the smaller sample sizes and subsequent uneven distribution among various subgroups, 
making it difficult draw strong clinical conclusions. In any case, from the presented analyses, it seems 
that  there  were  no  new  or  different  safety  signal  also  in  the  comparison  with  the  UC/CD  patient 
populations.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific interaction studies have been performed in patients with pouchitis. The section 4.5 of the 
SmPC has been updated with information on Study Vedolizumab-4004 which is acceptable. 
AEs leading to discontinuation 
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, a lower proportion of patients treated with vedolizumab reported AEs that 
led  to  discontinuation  (2.0%  [n=1]  vs.  9.8%  [n=5]).  The  only  AE  that  led  to  discontinuation  in  the 
vedolizumab group was pouchitis.  
Three out of the total of 6 TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in the SOC of GI disorders (1 
event of Crohn’s disease and 2 events of pouchitis). This was consistent with events reported in the UC 
and CD Vedolizumab IV studies, where the majority of events leading to discontinuation were due to 
Crohn’s disease and colitis ulcerative.  
Post marketing experience 
Vedolizumab has been marketed since 2014 and is approved for UC and CD in over 70 countries. Since 
the  launch  of  Entyvio  (vedolizumab)  for  IV  infusion,  cumulative  worldwide  patient  exposure  as  of  31 
March  2021  was  approximately  722,703  patient-years  and  no  new  major  safety  issues  have  been 
identified to date from the postmarketing data. The safety of vedolizumab has been well-characterized 
from postmarketing data; the recent periodic benefit-risk evaluation report (PBRER) did not identify any 
new safety concerns, and the safety data was found to be consistent with the known safety profile of the 
drug. There were no new trends or changes in clinical importance seen for IRRs, infections, malignancies, 
or hepatic events, and no cases of PML were reported.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of vedolizumab in subjects with pouchitis is considered to be acceptable, 
manageable, and overall similar to and consistent with the known safety profile observed in previous 
vedolizumab IV UC and CD studies in the IBD populations.

2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes 
were the following: 
Safety Specification 
Epidemiology of the indications and target population 
Addition of data for new indication of Pouchitis. The section is approvable. 
Clinical trial exposure 
Addition of data from study vedolizumab-4004, MLN0002SC-3031 and MLN0002SC-3030. The section 
is approvable. 
Post-authorisation experience 
Update of the section with post marketing data till DLP 31 March 2021. The section is acceptable.  
Identified and potential risks 
The information on risks have been amended according to current knowledge and experience.  
Annexes 
The annex 8 has been updated appropriately.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.0 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Entyvio is already authorised for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) and 
the pharmaceutical forms available for these indications are: 300 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion and 108 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. The user test has been 
performed at the time of the first MA (2013) and within the X/40 application (2019) aiming to 
introduce a new pharmaceutical form (solution for injection), associated with a new strength (108 mg) 
and a new route of administration (subcutaneous use).  
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 94/106 
 
 
 
The new proposed indication in pouchitis foresees the use of 300 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion dosing regimen with the same posology approved for UC/CD. As per UC and CD, 
Entyvio as IV infusion, should be administered by the HCP. The safety profile in the current population 
is similar to that already established for Entyvio in UC/CD. No major changes are proposed to the PIL 
as a result of the new indication, nor to the PIL layout/instructions for use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant is seeking the addition of a new therapeutic indication for Vedolizumab: 
Treatment of adult patients with pouchitis, who have undergone proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal 
anastomosis for ulcerative colitis, and have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were 
intolerant to antibiotic therapy. 
Vedolizumab  is  a  gut  selective  immunosuppressive  biologic.  It  is  a  humanized  immunoglobulin  G1 
monoclonal  antibody  that selectively  inhibits  the  interaction  of  the α4β7  integrin  on  memory  T  and  B 
cells with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 expressed on the vascular endothelium in the gut. 
Primary  efficacy  has  been  evaluated  in  terms  of  response  rates  with  a  composite  endpoint  clinically 
relevant  mPDAI  remission  after  14  weeks  of  treatment.  Clinically  relevant  remission  is  defined  as  an 
mPDAI score <5 and a reduction of overall score by ≥2 points from baseline at W14.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pouchitis is considered by clinical experts to be an independent medical entity of IBD and is a distinct 
target disease separable from UC and CD, the current authorized conditions approved for vedolizumab.  
Currently, there are no approved therapies for pouchitis in the EU, United Kingdom (UK), or US. 
Because pouchitis represents a disease spectrum ranging from acute antibiotic responsive to chronic 
antibiotic-refractory, optimal treatment regimens will vary. This condition is largely treated empirically 
with only small, predominantly retrospective studies having been conducted. Initial treatment of 
pouchitis focuses on correction of the perceived bacterial dysbiosis, with patients commonly prescribed 
antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, or rifaximin) as first-line treatment. Patients who develop 
chronic pouchitis either become dependent on antibiotics for symptom relief or have continuous 
symptoms despite chronic antibiotic therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
One pivotal study was conducted for the assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Study Vedolizumab-4004 (EARNEST): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab IV 300 mg in the treatment of adult subjects 
who  had  a  proctocolectomy  and  IPAA  for  treatment  of  UC  and  had  developed  chronic  or  recurrent 
pouchitis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 95/106 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy analysis was at 14 weeks and the secondary analysis at W34 (4 weeks after the 
last dose of study drug), with a final safety follow-up visit at W48. All subjects were expected to complete 
a long-term follow-up safety survey by telephone at W56, 26 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint: a statistically significant higher proportion of patients in the vedolizumab IV 300mg 
group  reached  mPDAI  remission  at  week  14  in  comparison  to  the  placebo  group  (31.4%  vs  9.8% 
respectively), with a treatment difference of 21.6% (95% CI: 4.9, 37.5) p=0.013 on FAS analysis.  
The primary analysis is supported by results from two sensitivity analyses (LOCF and hybrid approach), 
while PPS analysis and that accounting for concomitant use of antibiotics before week 14 did not.  
The efficacy (remission rate) of vedolizumab at week 34 was overall maintained although with a smaller 
difference from placebo (delta of 17, CI 0.3-35, p 0.043).   
PDAI  Remission  rates  at  week  14  and  34  (both  secondary  endpoints)  as  measured  by  PDAI  were 
consistent with the rates measured by using the mPDAI score, excluding histologic assessment, providing 
reassurance on the use of mPDAI as primary estimand.   
Moreover,  consistent  results  favouring  vedolizumab were  seen using  a  less  stringent  clinical endpoint 
i.e. partial mPDAI response at W14 and W34 (treatment difference of 29.4% and 21.6%, respectively).  
Results by type of pouchitis from primary estimand and available secondary endpoints i.e. mPDAI 34 
week,  PDAI  remission  as  well  as  in  the  partial  mPDAI  response  at  week  14  and  34  show  a  greater 
response difference for vedolizumab over placebo group in the recurrent pouchitis group as compared 
to the chronic one. 
Importantly, results coming from clinically relevant endpoints i.e. sustained mPDAI and PDAI remission 
(both at W14 and W34) support a benefit of vedolizumab over placebo with a difference of 21.6 pp (95% 
CI  6.5,  37.0)  for  sustained  mPDAI  remission  and  23.5  pp  (95%  CI  8.0,  38.8)  for  sustained  PDAI 
remission,  therefore  a  maintenance  of  the  effect  in  terms  of  disease  activity  control  with  a  clinically 
mindful effect size over placebo is observed.  
Other endpoints are in favour of vedolizumab effect (change in Total PDAI score, nominal p 0.025) and 
time to relapse/number of relapses (modest difference between the rates with vedolizumab 31.3% and 
placebo 40%). 
Results of histologic endpoint (RHI) and endoscopic ulcer endpoints (number, surface, SES-CD) showed 
better  results  with  vedolizumab  compared  to  placebo.  The  biomarkers  showed  little  (FC)  or  no 
improvement (CRP) with vedolizumab compared to placebo, not supporting their use as useful clinical 
measures of vedolizumab response.  
A  favourable  effect  of  vedolizumab  seems  to  be  exerted  on  corticosteroid-free  mPDAI  remission  and 
corticosteroid-free PDAI remission rates at 14 weeks, the same figure is not seen at a longer time point 
(week 34) and it is referred to a small subset of subjects taking concomitant corticosteroids treatment 
at baseline (7.8% in the vedolizumab group and 13.7% in the placebo group on Day 1). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The selected primary endpoint is not validated and the preferable one would have been PDAI clinically 
relevant remission; supportive data of a similar sensitivity and specificity of the mPDAI when compared 
with the PDAI in the setting of chronic pouchitis was provided, however this analysis was done only using 
Assessment report

Page 96/106 
 
 
 
data from this study. Therefore, although the concordance of PDAI and mPDAI scores in this study is 
relevant, the result could not be used to validate these tools.  
Although  a  statistically  significant  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  vedolizumab  IV  300mg  group 
reached mPDAI remission at week 14 in comparison to the placebo group, the observed effect size does 
not support the planned difference of 25% between vedolizumab and placebo raising concerns on the 
clinical  relevance  of  vedolizumab  effect.  The  assumptions  made  for  the  sample  size  calculation  were 
justified by assuming the optimistic (compared with infliximab) mPDAI remission rate at W14 of 40% 
for  vedolizumab  in  conjunction  with  the  conservative  assumption  of  a  high  placebo  remission  rate  of 
15%, and therefore a treatment difference of 25% for vedolizumab relative to placebo. Although this 
treatment difference was not achieved in the results of Study Vedolizumab-4004 (placebo around 10% 
and vedolizumab around 31%) the treatment effect estimate, that can be considered around 20%, was 
statistically significant and confirmed by several sensitivity analyses. 
Moreover, the effect size on the primary estimand appears different between the two subtypes chronic 
(15.6%, 95% CI -5.1, 36.2) and recurrent pouchitis (28.7%, 95% CI 6.1, 51.2) and wide confidence 
intervals were detected.  
Support  was  provided  on  the  homogeneity  of  vedolizumab  effect  between  strata:  although  a  higher 
treatment effect was detected among recurrent as compared to chronic pouchitis patients, differences 
were not statistically significant (CHM test). However, given the limited dataset and the small size of 
subgroups,  the  absence  of  a  significant  difference  between  the  subpopulations  could  not  be  seen  as 
conclusive on the comparability of the treatment effect. Further reassurance was gained on the results 
using a more conservative imputation approach for the primary estimand i.e. imputing missing data as 
non-responders  and  for  the  jump-to-reference  case,  the  missing  cases  in  both  treatment  arms  were 
imputed as responders according to the observed placebo response rate.  
Therefore, the use of vedolizumab for the treatment of pouchitis is sufficiently supported by available 
evidence and analyses. It should be mentioned that some inconsistency is noted i.e. sensitivity analysis 
or subgroup analyses but the small sample size and the wide CI hamper any firm conclusion. 
New analysis taking into account for multiple testing (Bonferroni and Bonferroni stepdown, Holm) on the 
main secondary endpoints (i.e. PDAI remission, Partial mPDAI response, Sustained mPDAI remission, 
Sustained  PDAI  remission)  show  that  4  of  the  7  endpoints  remain  significant  (PDAI  remission  W14, 
mPDAI response W14, Sustained mPDAI remission, and Sustained PDAI remission), whereas endpoints 
evaluated at week 34 (mPDAI remission, PDAI remission, mPDAI response) became not significant also 
in  line  with  the  jump-to-reference  analysis.  In  the  results  of  2  other  multiple  testing  approaches 
requested (Hochberg and Hommel), the p-values remained significant (<0.05) across all 7 variables. 
Therefore, reassurance on the effect of induction treatment (week 14) is gained and uncertainties persist 
on  maintenance  of  the  effect  (week  34).  Discontinuation  of  treatment  at  week  14  if  no  evidence  of 
therapeutic benefit is observed has been added to section 4.2. of the SmPC.  
Other secondary endpoints are in favour of vedolizumab effect however when the different PDAI domains 
were analysed, only the endoscopic subscore at week 14 showed a greater treatment difference in the 
vedolizumab group (not seen at week 34) therefore implying that results on the total score are mainly 
driven by the endoscopic subscore. A covariance (ANCOVA) model on these results confirmed that only 
for total PDAI and Endoscopic Inflammation scores the treatment effect was statistically significant.  
The  clinical  relevance  of  these  results,  considering  that  the  current  EMA  GL  highlights  that  clinically 
relevant effects in each of the main components of the PDAI score (symptoms as well as macro- and 
microscopic appearance of mucosa) is not supported by all components of the score but the endoscopic 
one is regarded as objective and clinically important.  
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 97/106 
 
 
 
Time to relapse, as well as number of relapses, could be considered as an important endpoint for both 
types  of  pouchitis;  however,  the  analysis  found  only  a  modest  difference  between  the  rates  with 
vedolizumab (31.3%) and placebo (40%). The Kaplan-Meier curves for time to relapse, both for overall 
population and for the subgroups of subjects classified as having recurrent or chronic pouchitis were not 
statistically significant between vedolizumab and placebo.  
Importantly, results on QoL endpoints (IBDQ and CGQL) do not clearly support vedolizumab effect over 
placebo questioning the benefits of vedolizumab as perceived by the patients.  
Biomarkers data showed little (FC) or no improvement (CRP) with vedolizumab compared to placebo, 
not supporting their use as useful clinical measures of vedolizumab response. 
A  favourable  effect  of  vedolizumab  seems  to  be  exerted  on  corticosteroid-free  mPDAI  remission  and 
corticosteroid-free  PDAI  remission  rates  at  14  weeks,  however  on  later  time  points  (week  34)  the 
advantage  is  not  seen  and  importantly  the  potential  advantage  is  only  referred  to  a  small  subset  of 
subjects taking concomitant corticosteroids treatment at baseline (7.8% in the vedolizumab group and 
13.7% in the placebo group on Day 1) making any claim not possible.  
The  two  chronic  pouchitis  subgroups,  as  defined  in  the  study,  appear  to  correspond  to  the  following 
classification reported in the literature: ‘Chronic’ as defined in the present study to Chronic Antibiotic-
Refractory Pouchitis (CARP), while ‘recurrent’ to Chronic Antibiotic-Dependent Pouchitis (CADP). In this 
context, the use of a clear identification of the two subgroups in the 4.1 and 5.1 sections of the SmPC is 
considered of clinical importance. The target population enrolled as per protocol inclusion criteria (IC) 
and  as  reflected  in  the  pouchitis-related  baseline  characteristics  had  moderately  to  severe  chronic 
pouchitis, patient intolerant to antibiotics were not included. Accordingly the MAH proposed during the 
procedure a revised wording of the indication: “Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with  moderately  to  severely  active  chronic  pouchitis,  who  have  undergone  proctocolectomy  and  ileal 
pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis, and have had an inadequate response with or lost response 
to antibiotic therapy”. 
The  target  population  including  the  setting  investigated,  the  characteristics  of  patients,  response  to 
antibiotic therapy, and eventually, considering the new analyses are now reflected in the wording of the 
indication. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, in Study Vedolizumab-4004, around 92% of patients treated with vedolizumab experienced at 
least 1 TEAE compared with approximately 86% of subjects receiving placebo. 
In the comparison with UC/CD patient populations, TEAEs of any type and severity were reported less 
frequently in the pouchitis group than in the UC study C13006, the combined UC/CD studies C13006 and 
C13007,  and  the  combined  UC/CD  OLE  study  C13008  No  significant  differences  were  observed  when 
comparing  the  overall  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  between  Study  Vedolizumab-4004  and  the 
UC/CD OLE Study C13008.  
The SOC with the higher frequency of TEAEs in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group 
were GI disorders (70.6% vs. 62.7%; with pouchitis being the most frequent AE in this SOC: 47.1% 
[n=24] vs. 39.2% [n=20]); Infections and Infestations (47.1% vs. 29.4%; with nasopharyngitis being 
the  most  frequently  reported  AE  in  this  SOC:  6  subjects  in  each  treatment  group);  Nervous  system 
disorder (29.4% vs. 9.8%; with headache being the most frequent AE in this SOC: 19.6% [n=10] vs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 98/106 
 
 
 
 
5.9% [n=3]); Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (9.8% vs. 3.9%); Eye disorders (9.8% vs. 
2.0%); Blood and lymphatic system disorders (7.8% vs. 2.0%).    
Overall, pouchitis (reported as related to a flare or worsening of pouchitis) was the most frequent TEAE 
occurring in a higher number of subjects (24, [47.1%]) in the vedolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group (20 subjects [39.2%]) suggesting a potential loss of efficacy. 
The other most frequent TEAEs in the vedolizumab group were (in order of frequency by the percentage 
of  subjects  who  experienced  the  event):  headache,  arthralgia,  nasopharyngitis,  nausea,  upper 
respiratory tract infection, influenza, frequent bowel movement, and abdominal pain.  
TEAEs occurring more frequently with vedolizumab treatment as compared to placebo and occurring in 
at least ≥4% of subjects in the vedolizumab group (in order of frequency) were pouchitis -as mentioned 
above-, headache (19.6% [n=10] vs. 5.9% [n=3]), upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% [n=5] vs. 
2.0% [n=1]), abdominal pain (7.8% vs. 5.9%), influenza (7.8% [n=4] vs. 2.0% [n=1]), and frequent 
bowel movements (7.8% [n=4] vs. 3.9% [n=2]).  
The overall summary of TEAEs by SOC in Vedolizumab-4004 were consistent with those presented in the 
ISS in subjects with IBD. As would be expected in subjects with pouchitis or IBD, GI disorders were the 
most frequently reported TEAEs. 
In terms of most frequent AEs, the safety profile of vedolizumab in the pouchitis group is overall similar 
to that reported for the other indications. 
The majority of the AEs reported in the Vedolizumab-4004 Study was mild or moderate in intensity in 
both treatment groups %). A lower proportion of vedolizumab-treated patients experienced a TEAE that 
was considered by the investigator to be severe in intensity (5.9% [n=3] vs. 9.8% [n=5] in the placebo 
group). Most severe TEAEs occurred in the GI disorders SOC (6 subjects, 5.9%) with pouchitis (reported 
as  related  to  a  flare  or  worsening  of  pouchitis)  being  the  most  common  severe  TEAE,  reported  in  1 
subject  (2.0%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  2  subjects  (3.9%)  in  the  vedolizumab  group,  as  mentioned 
above. The pouchitis event occurred in the placebo group was considered as a SAE and related to the 
study drug by the investigator while the 2 severe events of pouchitis occurred in the vedolizumab groups 
were not deemed to be drug-related and only 1 was considered to be a SAE.   
Severe events reported in the IBD studies occurred only within the GI disorders SOC and included events 
of CD, abdominal pain, and colitis ulcerative. 
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, drug-related TEAEs were reported with a slightly higher frequency in the 
vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group (23.5% [n=12] vs. 21.6% [n=11]), in particular, 
in the SOC Infections and Infestations (15.7% [n=8] vs. 7.8% [n=4]).  
The same was also observed in subjects with IBD, where the majority of drug-related AEs were reported 
within the SOC of infections and infestations (ISS). 
AESI categories were predefined in the protocol of Study Vedolizumab-4004, based on the mechanism 
of  action  of  vedolizumab  and  the  known  safety  profile.  The  5  AESI  categories  are  hypersensitivity 
reactions including IRRs, PML, liver injury, malignancies, and serious infections. A total of 16 AESI events 
were reported with a lower proportion in the vedolizumab group compared with the placebo group (9.8% 
[n=6]  vs.  13.7%  [n=10]),  which  is  reassuring.  Most  frequently  reported  AESIs  were  hypersensitivity 
reactions including IRRs that occurred in 3 subjects (5.9%) in the vedolizumab group and in 2 subjects 
(3.9%) in the placebo group. None of these events were specifically reported as IRRs. All events in this 
AESI category were considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug, with the exception 
of an event of chest discomfort, considered related to study drug and mild in intensity, that occurred in 
1  subject  in  the  vedolizumab  group.  Liver  injury  AESIs  were  reported  in  1  subject  (2.0%)  in  the 
Assessment report

vedolizumab group and in 3 subjects (5.9%) in the placebo group. The AESI of hepatic enzyme increase 
in  1  subject  in  the  vedolizumab  treated  group  was  assessed  to  be  mild  in  intensity,  and  the  subject 
recovered from the event during the study. AESIs of malignancies were reported in 2 subjects (3.9%) 
in the placebo group and in none in the vedolizumab group, including basal cell carcinoma and benign 
neoplasm of testis.  Regarding serious infections, 1 subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group (and none 
in  the  placebo  group)  experienced  a  serious  infection  AESI  of  gastroenteritis  considered  by  the 
investigator to be not related to study drug. No cases of PML were reported. 
A  total of  53  subjects  reported 83  TEAE events related to a flare;  as  mentioned  above,  at  least  1 
TEAE related to a pouchitis flare was reported in a higher proportion of patients treated with vedolizumab 
than in the placebo group (56.9% [n=29] vs. 47.1% [n=24]). Pouchitis was the most frequently reported 
PT  related  to  a  flare  and with  a  higher  frequency  in  vedolizumab  subjects  (47.1%  [n=24]  vs.  37.3% 
[n=19] in the placebo group).  
Multiple episodes of pouchitis in a given subject was also higher in the vedolizumab group. One subject 
in the vedolizumab group had 5 episodes of pouchitis, 1 subject had 3 episodes, and 3 subjects had 2 
episodes each, whereas, in the placebo group, only 1 subject experienced 3 episodes of pouchitis and 
no  subjects  experienced  >3  episodes.  Among  events  reported  in  the  vedolizumab  group,  2  were 
considered  severe,  1  event  was  considered  treatment-related,  and  1  event  led  to  discontinuation  of 
treatment. Approximately half of the pouchitis events in the vedolizumab group occurred before Week 
14,  and  6  events  occurred  after  Week  34.  No  specific  trends  were  observed  between  the  time  of 
treatment and onset of the event or the duration of the event. 
The majority of TEAEs related to flare were reported to be mild or moderate in intensity; severe events 
were  reported  in  4  subjects,  with  2  in  each  treatment  group.  TEAEs  related  to  flare  were  considered 
related  to  study  drug  in  only  1  (2.0%)  subject  in  the  vedolizumab  group  and  in  3  (5.9%)  subjects 
receiving placebo. The TEAE of pouchitis in the vedolizumab-treated subject began on Day 44 and was 
assessed as related to treatment and moderate in intensity; the subject recovered from the event on 
Day 47 and completed the study on Day 332.  
TEAEs  related  to  flare  that  led  to  discontinuation  occurred  in  1  (2.0%)  vedolizumab  subject  and  in  2 
(3.9%) placebo subjects.  
A slightly lower proportion of SAEs was reported in patients treated with vedolizumab compared with 
placebo  (5.9%  [n=3]  vs.  7.8%  [n=4]).  Pouchitis  was  the  SAE  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
vedolizumab  group  (3.9%  [n=2]  vs.  2.0%  [n=1]),  however,  only  the  event  occurred  in  the  placebo 
group was considered related to study drug by the investigators. One vedolizumab patient had a SAE of 
gastroenteritis. No SAEs led to study drug discontinuation. Consistent with underlying disease and the 
other indications, the majority of SAEs were reported within the GI disorders SOC, reported in a total of 
5 of 7 subjects (4.9%). The incidence rate of SAEs  was reported as 7.2 per 100 subject-years in the 
vedolizumab group and 10.1 per 100 subject-years in the placebo group. Pouchitis was reported as 4.8 
per 100 subject-years in the vedolizumab group and 2.5 per 100 subject-years in the placebo group.   
Regarding the SAE related to a flare, the 2 subjects experiencing events of pouchitis in the vedolizumab 
group,  which  was  not  considered  related  to  study  drug,  were  both  hospitalized  due  to  worsening  of 
pouchitis. In particular, one subject was hospitalized on Day 8; the event was also considered severe in 
intensity and recovered on Day 14; the subject discontinued study drug on Day 43 due to lack of efficacy 
and attended the end of study visit on Day 347. The second subject was hospitalized on Day 48 after 
the  subject  had  discontinued  study  drug  on  Day  43  due  to  worsening  pouchitis  that  was  considered 
moderate in intensity; the subject recovered from the event on Day 62 and completed an end of study 
visit  on  Day  72.  Regarding  the  event  of  pouchitis  in  the  placebo-treated  subject,  considered  by  the 
investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug  and  severe  in  intensity,  it  began  on  Day  68  (>30  days 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022

posttreatment); the subject was hospitalized for a laparotomy ileostomy, recovered from the event on 
Day 76 and attended the end of study visit on Day 272.  
In Study Vedolizumab-4004, a lower proportion of patients treated with vedolizumab reported TEAEs 
that led to discontinuation (2.0% [n=1] vs. 9.8% [n=5]). The only AE that led to discontinuation in 
the vedolizumab group was pouchitis.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although in terms of most frequent AEs, the safety profile of vedolizumab in the pouchitis group is overall 
similar to that reported for the other indications, there are some TEAEs that occurred more frequently 
with  vedolizumab  treatment  as  compared  to  placebo  such  as  abdominal  pain  and  frequent  bowel 
movements (with a difference of approximately 2% and 4%, respectively), which are not reported in the 
section 4.8 of the current SmPC. Based on the thorough review of these two AEs made by the MAH, it 
was  agreed  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  establish  a  strong  causal  association  between  the 
events and vedolizumab, given the small difference in the incidence of these AEs between vedolizumab 
and placebo groups, the absence of remarkable differences in the characteristics of these AEs between 
the two treatment groups, and the multiple concomitant medications during the time of the event that 
could have contributed to their occurrence.  
Other AEs which occurred in the vedolizumab group in at least 2 subjects (3.9%) versus none in the 
placebo  group  were:  anaemia,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  rectal  hemorrhage,  musculoskeletal 
pain, asthenia, and chest discomfort (for all, 3.9% [n=2] vs. 0). Therefore, for the above-mentioned 
AEs,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  whether  they  (or  at  least  some  of  them) could  be  due  to  lack  of 
efficacy  and  whether they  should  have  been  added in  the  ADR  table  of  the 4.8  section  of  the  SmPC. 
Based  on  the  analyses  made  by  the  MAH,  most  of  these  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity, 
nonserious, recovered, did not lead to discontinuation, and were not considered related to study drug 
by  the  investigator.  For  some  of  these  events  (i.e.,  anaemia,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  and 
musculoskeletal  pain),  a  conclusion  on  the  causal  relationship  with  vedolizumab  treatment  cannot  be 
drawn. For the remaining AEs: a) in the absence of confounding factors, the MAH was asked to include 
rectal hemorrhage AEs, which were not even associated with pouchitis events or the absence of remission 
status, in the ADR Table in section 4.8 of the SmPC; b) in the presence of a clear temporal relationship 
with  IRR,  asthenia  and  chest  discomfort  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  be  included  in  the  already 
existing  list  of  signs  and  symptoms  of  infusion-related  reactions  reported  under  the  SOC  General 
disorders and administration site conditions in the table of section 4.8 and asthenia was requested by 
the CHMP to be included for consistency in the new text of the subsection “Infusion-related reactions” 
(see also below the discussion on the AESIs). The MAH agreed with these PI updates.  
Exposure-adjusted  analyses  were  performed  to  adjust  for  differences  in  overall  exposure  between 
treatment groups. Overall, exposure-adjusted incidence rates in both vedolizumab and placebo groups 
were  similar  (113.3  and  111.1  per  100  subject-years,  respectively).  However,  differences  persisted 
between the treatment groups in terms of a higher incidence rates in the vedolizumab group compared 
with the placebo group of the following AEs: pouchitis (57.8 per 100 subject-years [n=24] vs. 50.5 per 
100  subjects-years  [n=20]),  headache  (24.1  [n=10]  vs.  7.6  [n=3]),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(12.0  [n=5]  vs.  2.5  [n=1]),  influenza  and  frequent  bowel  movements  (for  both,  9.6  [n=4]  vs.  2.5 
[n=1]), anaemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, rectal haemorrhage, asthenia, chest discomfort, and 
musculoskeletal pain (for all, 4.8 [n=2] vs. 0). As reported above and herein, for these AEs other than 
those  already  reported  in  the  ADR  Table  of  the  SmPC  section  4.8,  the  MAH  provided  the  requested 
Assessment report  
EMA/13745/2022  
Page 101/106 
 
 
 
 
clarifications  and  included  rectal  hemorrhage,  asthenia,  chest  discomfort  into  SmPC  section  4.as 
requested by the CHMP.   
In order to better understand the safety profile of vedolizumab in different subgroup populations, the 
MAH was asked to provide safety data in terms of AEs, AESIs, SAEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, stratified by: a) chronic vs. recurrent pouchitis; b) anti-TNFalfa naïve vs. experienced 
status,  c)  baseline  clinical  severity,  d)  concomitant  use  of  antibiotics  excluding  ciprofloxacin  as 
companion (first 4 weeks). Based on the data submitted by the MAH, in general, given the small numbers 
reliable  conclusions  from  these  subgroup  analyses  can  be  drawn.  More  AEs  occurred  in  subjects  who 
were anti-TNF naïve, had severely active pouchitis at baseline, and who did not use any concomitant 
antibiotics before W34, with a higher frequency of SAE in the recurrent pouchitis subgroup compared 
with  the  chronic  subgroup.  However,  no  relevant  difference  vedolizumab  and  placebo  arms  were 
observed.  
It is acknowledged that, overall, there were no apparent trends or events that were of clinical concern 
among  the  AESIs  reported  in  subjects  with  pouchitis  treated  with  vedolizumab.  AESIs  seems  to  be 
consistent with those previously reported in the ISS in subjects with IBD. However, in the section 4.8 of 
the SmPC, the MAH was asked to update the paragraph on “Description of selected adverse reactions” 
with the specific results of the Study Vedolizumab-4004. As requested, the MAH agrees to the addition 
of AESI information from Study Vedolizumab-4004 to section 4.8 of the SmPC. New text has been added 
to the subsections “Infusion-related reactions” and “Infections”. IRRs were reported in 3 subjects (5.9%) 
in the vedolizumab group and in 2 subjects (3.9%) in the placebo group. The individual PTs included 
mouth ulceration, swelling, oedema peripheral, chest discomfort, acute kidney injury, obstructive airway 
disorder and flushing. All events were mild to moderate in intensity, nonserious, did not lead to study 
discontinuation, and were considered not related to study drug by the investigator except for one event 
of chest discomfort. The wording of the new text can be considered acceptable, however, as mentioned 
above, there were 3 AEs of asthenia reported in 2 vedolizumab subjects occurred during drug infusions. 
Given the temporal relationship with the vedolizumab infusion in terms of onset and duration, the MAH 
pointed out that these events were most likely an infusion-related reaction consistent with the known 
ADR of vedolizumab. The causality is likely and, therefore, as mentioned above, the MAH was requested 
to include asthenia in the new text of the subsection “Infusion-related reactions”; the MAH agreed to 
make these changes to the PI.  The new text in the subsection “Infections” can be considered acceptable. 
A serious infection of AESI was reported in 1 subject (2.0%) in the vedolizumab group and in none in 
the placebo group. The subject was hospitalized and the event was severe in intensity, not considered 
related to study drug by the investigator, and recovered. The MAH specified that in Study Vedolizumab-
4004 there was no trend of infections in relation to BMI and no higher risk of infections in patients who 
had  prior  exposure  to  TNF-alfa  antagonist  therapy.  Therefore,  the  current  statement  in  the  SmPC  is 
referred only to UC and CD studies and not to pouchitis. This is acceptable. No changes were necessary 
for the text of the subsection “Malignancies”. 
Overall, no specific differences between the event of pouchitis occurred in the placebo group and those 
occurred in the vedolizumab group. Both vedolizumab subjects discontinued the study drug. Furthernore, 
as mentioned above, pouchitis (reported as related to a flare or worsening of pouchitis) was the most 
frequently  reported  TEAE  occurring  in  a  higher  proportion  of  vedolizumab-treated  patients  compared 
with the placebo group (47.1% [n=24] vs. 39.2% [n=20], with a difference of 7.9%), even though the 
majority of the events was of mild to moderate intensity. Given the above, i) the MAH was requested to 
provide information on the proportion of AEs of pouchitis which recovered and those which did not and 
the  proportion  of  pouchitis  events  that  needed  additional  treatments  by  severity  intensity  and  by 
treatment  groups.  ii)  Although  vedolizumab  is  proposed  for  the  treatment  of  pouchitis,  the  MAH  was 
asked to elaborate on whether there is a possible biological rationale that this drug might exacerbate 
the pre-existing pouchitis or whether all the pouchitis events in terms of flare of pouchitis or worsening

of the pre-esisting pouchitis, could be definitely considered as a consequence of lack of efficacy. iii) The 
MAH was requested to consider to include flare and worsening of pouchitis in the ADR Table of the SmPC 
section  4.8  with  a  corresponding  warning  in  section  4.4.  The  MAH  presented the  requested  data  and 
discussion  and  based  on  i)  the  absence  of  clinically  relevant  differences  between  vedolizumab  and 
placebo treatment groups in terms of pouchitis event outcome and the need of additional treatment; ii) 
the  unlikelihood  of  vedolizumab  causing  exacerbation  of  pouchitis  on  the  basis  of  its  mechanism  of 
action;  iii)  the  absence  of  evident  relationship  between  the  occurrence  of  pouchitis  events  and 
achievement of mPDAI remission; and iv) the absence of relevant differences in terms of demographics 
and clinical characteristics between patients with and without pouchitis events, it was agreed with the 
MAH that there was no sufficient evidence to conclude for the inclusion of flare and worsening of pouchitis 
in section 4.8 or as a warning in section 4.4. 
Safety in special populations was not specifically studied. Concerning pregnancy, one case of pregnancy 
was reported in the Study Vedolizumab-4004 on pouchitis. In Study Vedolizumab-4004, the mean (SD) 
age was 41.9 (12.44) years (40.8 years in the vedolizumab group vs. 42.9 years in the placebo group) 
with  a  range  from  19  to  68  years.  The  majority  of  patients  (61.8%)  was  aged  25  to  <65  years. 
Clarifications  was  needed  on  whether  differences  in  safety  of  vedolizumab  were  observed  by  age 
categories between the treatment groups. The comparison by age categories had to be performed also 
with  the  data  coming  from  the  ISS  on  IBD.  The  same  analyses  by  gender  and  race/ethnicity  were 
requested.  The  assessments  of  safety  by  age  categories,  gender,  race,  and  ethnicity  were  however 
limited  by  the  smaller  sample  sizes  and  subsequent  uneven  distribution  among  various  subgroups, 
making  it  difficult  draw  strong  clinical  conclusions.  In  any  case,  from  the  presented  analyses,  there 
appeared  to  be  no  new  or  different  safety  signal  also  in  the  comparison  with  the  UC/CD  patient 
populations. 
Immunogenicity was not specifically evaluated in Study Vedolizumab-4004. Antibodies to vedolizumab 
may develop during vedolizumab treatment, most of which are neutralizing. The immunogenicity profile 
is  reflected  in  the  approved  product  labeling  for  Entyvio  (vedolizumab)  for  IV  infusion,  which  is 
acceptable.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary estimand analysis showed a statistically significant higher proportion of patients in the 
vedolizumab IV 300mg group reached mPDAI remission at week 14 in comparison to the placebo 
group, several conservative analyses have supported the robustness of the results. 
The safety profile of vedolizumab in subjects with pouchitis is considered to be acceptable, 
manageable, and overall similar to and consistent with the known safety profile observed in previous 
vedolizumab IV UC and CD studies in the IBD populations.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The use of vedolizumab for the treatment of pouchitis is sufficiently supported by available evidence. 
Therefore, the benefits outweigh the risks.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Entyvio is positive in the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely 
active chronic pouchitis, who have undergone proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis for 
ulcerative colitis, and have had an inadequate response with or lost response to antibiotic therapy.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIB and IV 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
chronic pouchitis, who have undergone proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis for 
ulcerative colitis, and have had an inadequate response with or lost response to antibiotic therapy for 
Entyvio; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for Entyvio 300 mg 
are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP is updated to version 7.   
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, IIIB, IV and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

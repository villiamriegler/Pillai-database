2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Haemophilia B 
Haemophilia B, or congenital Factor IX (FIX) deficiency, is an X-chromosomal-linked bleeding disorder 
with an incidence of approximately 1 in 30,000 live male births. Haemophilia B is the second most 
common type of haemophilia and is 5 times rarer than haemophilia A. The World Federation of 
Haemophilia (WFH) reported a worldwide prevalence of 399,000 subjects with haemophilia, of which 
there are an estimated 80,000 patients with haemophilia B. In approximately 30 percent of haemophilia 
B cases, there is no family history of the disorder and the condition is the result of a spontaneous gene 
mutation. 
FIX is a vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factor that belongs to the class of serine proteases. FIX 
participates in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by activating factor X to its active form in the 
presence of Ca2+ ions, phospholipids, and cofactor VIIIa (tenase complex). The synthesis of FIX takes 
place in the hepatocytes, from where it is secreted into the circulation. The physiological plasma 
concentration of FIX is 1 IU/mL, which equals about 5 μg/mL. The plasma levels of FIX determine the 
severity of the disease, which is classified in severe (< 1% of normal), moderate (1 to <5% of normal) or 
mild haemophilia B (> 5% of normal). 
Severely diminished or absent levels of circulating FIX in haemophilia B result from impaired synthesis 
caused by major defects in gene structure (large deletions, insertions, frameshifts, and nonsense 
mutations) or from the rapid destruction of unstable defective FIX molecules. In contrast, missense 
mutations are often associated with aberrantly expressed FIX molecules that can be detected 
immunologically (cross-reactive material [CRM(+)]) but exhibit reduced activity in coagulation-based 
assays. Historically, haemophilia patients were only treated when they had bleeding episodes 
(on-demand). One of the main reasons on-demand treatment is used is due to the high cost and limited 
supply of FIX products. However, it has become known that treatment of severe haemophilia with 
frequent, periodic prophylactic FIX infusions can have significant medical and quality of life benefits. On 
prophylaxis, adequate plasma levels of FIX for haemostasis are maintained, approximating a 
non-diseased state. Prophylaxis treatment started at a young age would facilitate a complete lack of 
bleeding episodes and help to maintain healthy joints. 
About the product 
The active substance of Rixubis is constituted of purified FIX protein produced by recombinant DNA 
technology. The drug product is formulated as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder preparation, 
intended for intravenous (IV) infusion. It is available in single-use vials containing the labelled amount of 
factor IX activity, expressed in International Units (IU). Each vial contains nominally 250, 500, 1000, 
2000, or 3000 IU of coagulation factor IX (recombinant). After reconstitution, the solution is clear, 
Assessment report

colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.8 to 7.2. The osmolality is greater than 240 m 
osmol/kg. 
Rixubis contains recombinant coagulation factor IX (nonacog gamma). Factor IX is a single chain 
glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 68,000 Dalton. It is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation 
factor and it is synthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation 
pathway and by factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway. Activated factor IX, in 
combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into 
thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is formed. 
The Applicant applied for the following  indication which was finally approved: Rixubis is indicated for the 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency). 
Rixubis is indicated in patients of all age groups. 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on 
the location and extent of the bleeding, and on the patient’s clinical condition, age and pharmacokinetic 
parameters of factor IX, such as incremental recovery and half-life. 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose 
to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may 
require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in 
particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor 
IX activity) is indispensable. 
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity plasma level has been attained, careful monitoring using an 
appropriate factor IX activity assay is advised and, if necessary, appropriate adjustments to the dose and 
the frequency of repeated infusions should be performed. When using an in vitro thromboplastin time 
(aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients’ blood samples, 
plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the 
reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory 
and/or reagents used in the assay.  
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related 
to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International 
Standard for factor IX in plasma). 
The calculation of the required dose of factor IX for “On demand treatment” in adults is based on the 
empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX 
activity by 0.9 IU/dL (range from 0.5 to 1.4 IU/dL) or 0.9% of normal activity in patients 12 years and 
older (further information see SmPC sections 4.2; 5.2). In the paediatric population the calculation of the 
required dose of factor IX  for on demand treatment is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 0.7 IU/dL (range 
from 0.31 to 1.0 IU/dL) or 0.7% of normal activity in patients less than 12 years of age (further 
information see section 5.2). 
The required dose is determined using the following formula: 
Patients 12 years and older

units 
=  body weight (kg)

x

For an incremental recovery of 0.9 IU/dL per IU/kg, the dose is calculated as follows: 
Required 
units 
=  body weight (kg) 
x 
desired factor IX rise 
(%) or (IU/dL) 
x 
1.1 dL/kg 
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses 
are 40 to 60 IU of factor IX per kilogram of body weight at intervals of 3 to 4 days for patients 12 years 
and older. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, age, bleeding 
phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
For an incremental recovery of 0.7 IU/dL per IU/kg in paediatric patients <12 years, the dose is 
calculated as follows: 
Required 
units 
=  body weight (kg) 
x 
desired factor IX rise 
(%) or (IU/dL) 
x 
1.4 dL/kg 
The recommended dose range for prophylaxis in paediatric patients less than 12 years is 40 to 80 IU/kg 
at intervals of 3 to 4 days. In some cases, depending upon the individual patient´s pharmacokinetics, 
age, bleeding phenotype and physical activity, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be 
necessary. 
Rixubis is administered intravenously up to a maximum of 10 ml/min.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Rixubis is a recombinant factor IX clotting factor. It has structural and functional characteristics 
comparable to those of endogenous FIX and to the approved rFIX product, Benefix.  
The active substance is produced and secreted by a FIX/furin co-expressing CHO cell line where the Furin 
endopeptidase will cleave signal peptide and propeptide (pro-FIX) sequences.  
No monoclonal antibodies, no materials of human or animal origin are employed in the manufacture, 
purification, or formulation of the final product, thus reducing the risk of transmission of adventitious 
agents. The process includes solvent/detergent treatment and 15 nm nanofiltration as virus 
inactivation/removal steps. 
The drug product is presented as a powder and solvent for injection (IV use) in 5 dosage strengths 250, 
500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 IU/vial.  All dosage strengths are formulated with 20 mM L-histidine, 60 mM 
sodium chloride, 4 mM calcium chloride, 110 mM mannitol, 35 mM sucrose and 0.005% wt polysorbate 80 
and are reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Sufficient general information, including nomenclature, structural formula and general properties has 
been provided. The company code is BAX 326. 
Rixubis rFIX is a glycoprotein which is secreted by a genetically engineered FIX/furin co-expressing CHO 
cell line. It has 415 amino acids in a single chain corresponding to the mature zymogen and the primary 
amino acid sequence is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma–derived factor IX, however, some 
post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different to those of the plasma-derived

molecule. It is synthesized as a single chain polypeptide and secreted in its mature form. The molecule is 
folded in a 3-dimensional structure and consists of several discrete functional domains, including the Gla 
domain, two epidermal growth factor domains (EGF1 and EGF2), an activation peptide and the catalytic 
domain. As in other vitamin K-dependent proteins, the Rixubis rFIX undergoes a number of 
post-translational maturation events prior to secretion such as gamma-carboxylation, N- and O 
glycosylation, sulfation and hydroxylation. These modifications are located in light chain and activation 
peptide. No post translational modification is observed on heavy chain. 
Figure: Schematic overview of the Rixubis Drug Substance molecule (Company code BAX326): 
Activation of factor IX occurs by cleavage after Arg145 and Arg180 by the action of factor XIa (intrinsic 
coagulation pathway) or factor VIIa/tissue factor (TF) (extrinsic coagulation pathway) which results in 
two disulfide-linked peptide chains (light chain and heavy chain). Incomplete cleavage can result in 
partially activated forms of factor IX as shown below:

Manufacture, characterisation and process control 
Manufacturing sites 
All sites were inspected by European competent authorities within the 3 last years and were deemed 
compliant with European GMP Guidance for the manufacture of the active substance.  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Overall, the active substance manufacturing process is considered as adequately described. It consist of 
11 manufacturing steps including continuous cell culture, purification by anion and affinity 
chromatography, two virus inactivation/removal steps, concentration and pre-formulation steps. Flow 
charts have been presented. The ranges of critical process parameters and routine in-process controls 
along with acceptance criteria are described for each step and are considered adequately set to control 
the manufacturing process. The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.  
Control of materials 
Suppliers of raw materials are selected based upon their ability to supply materials that consistently meet 
specifications established for each raw material used in the manufacture of rFIX. Compendial materials 
comply with the specified pharmacopoeia monographs. Compendial and non-compendial raw materials 
are tested either by their manufacturer, by Baxter, or by contractors except identity testing. Identity 
testing is carried out in Baxter laboratories. 
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) originated from countries with a controlled BSE risk was used in the 
development of the MCB. No other human or animal-derived materials were used upstream of the MCB. 
Furthermore, no proteins of human or animal origin are used in the commercial manufacturing process 
starting from the master cell bank. 
The cDNA encoding human factor IX carrying the Ala148 polymorphism was originally isolated from a 
randomly primed human liver cDNA library. A stably transfected CHO cell line expressing factor IX and 
Furin was generated. The construction of the expression vector is adequately described. Sufficient 
information has been provided regarding the characteristics of the plasmid and the producer cell line. 
The Working Cell Bank (WCB) used to manufacture rFIX Bulk Drug Substance (BDS) is derived from the 
Master Cell Bank (MCB) for cell line CHO rFIX. Acceptable information has been submitted regarding the 
testing of MCB, WCB and EOP and release of future WCBs. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for 
cells at and beyond the limit of cell age.  
It has been confirmed that in case of a change to the cell banking, a variation will be submitted. 
Process validation 
Process validation was performed at the commercial scale manufacturing facility. It should be noted that 
the DS manufacturing process was studied through a Design of Experiments (DOEs) approach during 
Pharmaceutical development; however, no design space is claimed. 
To get a clear understanding of the process description with its control strategy, the applicant submitted, 
as requested at D180, a comprehensive list of critical process parameters for each DS manufacturing step 
in a tabular format. For each CPP, the set points and ranges have been specified, when appropriate. In the 
updated description of the process some non CPPs which generally correspond to PP that are usually 
found under the description of the process are mentioned.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014

An integrated approach to process validation was taken. The consistency and robustness of full scale 
manufacturing was demonstrated through process verification carried out with the conformance lots. The 
life-cycle of the process is managed through a process monitoring program. 
Process validation was performed to demonstrate the following: 
● Manufacturing process control and robustness 
● intra-production run consistency (all batches within a given production run) 
● inter-production run consistency (batches from start, middle and end of several production runs) 
● manufacturing process capability 
● impurity removal (inter-production run capability). 
Data collected during process validation showed that the process can consistently manufacture rFIX 
product which meets the product specifications. The rFIX production process yields a high purity product 
with a high rFIX specific activity and a low aggregate and dimer content. Extended characterisation 
provides support for the consistency of the manufacturing process within and between the production 
runs. No differences were observed between the beginning, middle and end of a production run, and 
extension of a production run and extended hold times did not impact the characteristics of rFIX product. 
The data collected during process validation show that the process is capable of reducing process related 
impurities and product related impurities.  Some discrepancies regarding the specification limits and the 
conformance batches used for process validation were identified and clarified during the procedure. 
Concerns originating from the reported rFIX specific activity values (U/mg) as measure of purification 
efficacy for each purification step have been solved. 
Process validation data of 3 different end runs have demonstrated that the chaemostat run time has now 
been sufficiently validated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process was scaled up in 3 stages . A chronological summary of the process 
modifications is presented, in relation to the production runs and DS batches concerned. The downstream 
production runs (and related DS batches) could be considered as obtained according to a representative 
process of the commercial process. The related DS batches were studied through process validation, 
characterisation and stability. Regarding the corresponding DP batches, they were also studied through 
validation, characterization and stability of the DP. On a quality aspect, the recent and representative 
versions of the manufacturing process have been adequately studied. 
On a clinical aspect, it is noted that representative DP batches were studied during Pivotal Phase I-III 
clinical studies 251002 and 251101, while the Pivotal clinical study 250901 involved batches issued from 
previous and less representative manufacturing processes. It could be noted that DP batches from the 
production run, which corresponds to the last version of the manufacturing process, were not used during 
these Pivotal clinical studies. However, within the response to D180 LOI, the applicant provided a 
comparability study on quality aspects, between DP batches used in pivotal clinical studies, obtained with 
a former production and the commercial DS process. The comparability study has considered the DP 
release tests. Results are comparable. 
In addition, a comprehensive characterization comparability study has been provided (in response to a 
non-clinical question), which also demonstrates the comparability between non-clinical, early clinical and 
clinical / commercial batches. 
The rFIX one-stage clotting assay used for product labelling was improved during product development; 
however, pieces of information on the improvement of the method and the date of implementation were

not given.  Furthermore, it appears that the Phase III clinical batches were tested according to the rFIX 
clotting assay before being improved. The applicant has provided data from the study leading to the 
improvement of the rFIX one-stage clotting assay during the procedure. 
In the EMA/EDQM Workshop Characterisation of new clotting factor concentrates (FVIII, FIX) with respect 
to potency assays used for labelling and testing of post infusion samples, held on 28-29 November 2013, 
the applicant has indicated that potency results can be affected by the type of aPTT reagent used in the 
clotting assay. As requested in the Day180 LoOI further data on the aPTT dependency of the clotting 
assay have been provided. A study report which summarizes the investigations performed by the 
Company has been submitted as part of the MAA for Rixubis: rFIX activities of Rixubis and BeneFIX were 
determined with the 1-stage clotting assay using 12 different aPTT reagents, the resulting potency was 
calculated relative to the labelled potency. In general higher recoveries were found for Rixubis (87% - 
144%) while for BeneFIX values between 64% and 111% were measured. The Dapttin reagent, for which 
a value of 98% has been measured, will be used as basis for the labelled potency of Rixubis. Concerning 
the possible consequences of the dependency of assay results on the aPTT reagent on product information 
the applicable changes of the revised core SmPC for FIX products have been implemented which includes 
high level information that plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type 
of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay.  
Characterisation 
The rFIX active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods. rFIX was investigated by a number of analytical methods focusing on the 
elucidation of the primary structure, post-translational modifications, three dimensional structures and 
the biological activity. A selected set of conformance Drug Substance samples representing the 
beginning, middle and end of three campaigns, as well as samples representing the longest possible hold 
times were used. Furthermore clinical Drug Product samples representing different potencies and 
samples from a marketed, rFIX comparator product with different potencies were included in this 
characterisation evaluation. 
Conformance batches of Rixubis (Drug Substance and Drug Product) were characterised with respect to 
their haemostatic potency, the efficiency of activation by FXIa and FVIIa in the presence of tissue factor 
and their capacity to bind to phospholipid vesicles. In addition, the functional properties of Rixubis were 
compared to three batches of the licensed, marketed, recombinant factor IX product with different 
potencies. 
A number of process and product related impurities were identified. Process-related impurities include 
biological impurities, chemical impurities, and other impurities from the fermentation medium. 
Product-related impurities derive from a number of modifications of rFIX such as aggregation, 
fragmentation, oxidation and deamidation.  
Impurities are controlled via appropriate specifications at Drug Substance level and/or their clearance 
during downstream-processing has been demonstrated through process validation. In summary, all 
impurities were found to be consistent within non-clinical and clinical Drug Substance production. 
Furthermore, consistency between different phases of fermentation (begin, middle, end) and different 
production runs could be shown. For some of the process-related impurities, for which clearance has been 
addressed in the process validation part, a description of the used analytical method has been provided 
during the procedure. Also additional information concerning the truncated forms and the clotting assay 
has been submitted. Information on the content of gamma carboxylation of N-terminal glutamic acid was 
provided with the response to the D180 LoI. It is recommended as committed that additional studies on 
the characterisation of charged active substance variants by IEF will be performed post authorisation (see 
section 2.2.6).

Specification 
Specifications for the drug substance were set in accordance to guideline ICH Q6B. The drug substance is 
routinely controlled by a range of chemical-physical and biological tests to assure consistent production of 
the drug substance. 
The initially proposed strategy for control of the glycosylation profile, which was not acceptable, has been 
revised and is now considered as appropriate. Also for the SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-activated 
conditions an acceptable justification for its use as identity test only has been provided.  A justification for 
the Drug Substance specifications as well as the batch numbers for set-up of each DS acceptance criterion 
has been submitted. The requested tightening of the acceptance criteria for the HCP limits has been 
implemented and this issue is now solved. 
Analytical methods 
A description of the test methods utilised for the release analysis of rFIX Drug Substance has been 
submitted, the validations of the analytical procedures were performed in conformance with the USP and 
European Pharmacopoeia guidelines. Details of the validation of analytical procedures and the SEC-HPLC 
method have been provided and updated during the procedure.  
For reference standards and materials reference is made to the Drug Product section. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system used for the storage of Rixubis BDS is the Nalgene square media bottle 1000 
mL. The bottle body is made of polyethylene terephthalate copolyester (PETG) and the screw cap is made 
of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Both the bottle body and the screw cap are considered product 
contact surfaces. Compliance of the container closure system with relevant Ph. Eur. monographs has 
been confirmed as well as a discussion on potential leachables/extractables has been provided. 
Stability 
The submitted stability data support the proposed shelf life (24 months) and storage conditions of the 
active substance (≤-60°C). Stability data were provided for eight commercial scale drug substance 
batches (3 clinical batches and 5 conformance lots). For the stability studies, samples were directly filled 
into 30 mL sterile PETG vials prior to freezing. The filling volume is 2.0 mL, representing a worst case 
surface-to-volume ratio. All vials were stored in the upright orientation. The parameters used to monitor 
the stability of the rFIX Drug Substance were selected to measure the quality, purity and potency of the 
rFIX Drug Substance. The parameters and specification used in the stability studies are a subset of the 
rFIX Drug Substance release parameters. The proposed testing strategy for product-related impurities 
during stability testing will be updated with respect to the tightening of molecular size distribution limits 
and the addition of a control test of the glycosylation pattern. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description and composition 
The Rixubis Final Drug Product (FDP) consists of a lyophilized powder for solution for injection and is 
supplied in a single-dose glass vial. The proposed nominal dosage strengths are 250, 500, 1000, 2000 
and 3000 IU/vial. All dosage strengths are formulated with L-histidine, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, 
mannitol, sucrose and polysorbate 80. Each dosage strength is reconstituted with a nominal volume of 5 
mL sterile Water for Injection (sWFI) and mixed prior to intravenous injection. Rixubis is packaged into a 
product kit consisting of one product vial, one diluent vial containing approximately 5 mL of sterile Water 
for Injection (sWFI), one BaxJect II needleless transfer device, and one package insert (PI).

Pharmaceutical Development 
The Rixubis Drug Product process development took a systematic, stepwise approach. The three steps, as 
outlined below were initial screening of conditions and buffer components for product compatibility and 
stability, including thermal and photo stability. Subsequently, the critical lyophilisation process 
parameters were studied and the final manufacturing process was defined. As a last step, the finalised 
manufacturing process parameters (target and ranges) were characterised using a DoE approach. Since 
the formulation and lyophilisation processes are interdependent, an integrated approach to process 
characterisation was utilised. 
A detailed overview of the correspondences between DS manufacturing processes, DP manufacturing 
processes, related DS production runs, DS and DP batches as well as use of these different batches in 
Preclinical and Clinical studies has been provided. 
The formulation development took a systemic approach starting with screening for the impact of the pH, 
investigations on the buffer preference, and the impact of shear stress. The development work included 
also freeze-thaw studies, photo- and thermal stability studies; the influence of calcium on stability of 
Rixubis in liquid formulations as well as the influence of sugars on the aggregation was evaluated. 
Optimisation of the formulation included also an increase of the NaCl concentration in order to receive a 
better lyophilisation cake appearance while maintaining good product stability. No formulation overages 
are used for the Rixubis Drug Product. The nominal fill weight for each vial includes an overage intended 
to allow for fill variances, thereby ensuring that a full dose is provided upon reconstitution. 
Lyophilisation process development started with characterisation of the freeze-drying behaviour of the 
formulation buffer for rFIX by low temperature thermal analysis and by freeze dry microscopy. These 
results were compared with results of trial freeze dry cycles carried out under increasingly aggressive 
conditions until visual collapse was observed in the final freeze-dried product. Additionally, the vial heat 
transfer coefficient vs. pressure, the resistance of the dried product layer to flow of water vapour, and the 
equipment capability curve was used to construct a design space for primary drying.  
The final sterile filtration step and the corresponding process parameters were evaluated in terms of 
capacity, and influence on the product quality. 
A DoE approach was utilised to evaluate the influence of the variation of various process parameters of 
the existing formulation and lyophilisation process on the quality attributes of the rFIX FDP. Eight 
formulation parameters (six excipient concentrations, pH of formulated bulk, and rFIX clotting activity of 
formulated bulk) coupled with three lyophilisation parameters (freezing ramp rate/annealing time, 
annealing temperature and chamber pressure) were used as a variable for DoEs. 
In summary, reconstitution time, residual moisture and rFIX pre-activation activity are barely affected by 
the parameter variations of the DoE. The highest influence on quality attributes are

EMA/702760/2014 
Page 14/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aggregation/dimerization, the loss of rFIX clotting activity and specific activity. However, none of the DoE 
parameter settings result in final containers with an average dimerization of more than 1.0% and an 
average aggregation of more than 0.5%, which is far below the specification limit of 2.0%. The maximum 
loss of rFIX clotting activity is never more than 15%. The minimum observed recovery of rFIX specific 
activity is 73%. 
Manufacture of the product and process control 
The drug product manufacturing process has been adequately described. Appropriate in-process controls 
have been identified and are monitored to control the manufacture of rFIX Drug Product. In-process 
controls, test methods, as well as actions to be taken if out of range are presented.  
Briefly, the drug product manufacturing process comprises of the following steps: formulation, sterile 
filtration and filling, lyophilisation, capping, air ingress testing, visual inspection, packaging and labelling. 
Validation and evaluation studies were performed to demonstrate manufacturing process control, 
robustness and consistency. In summary, acceptance criteria were established in each validation protocol 
and results passed the acceptance criteria or were properly investigated. Based on the validation reports, 
it was concluded that the process and equipment are suitable for consistent manufacturing of Rixubis 
drug product. 
Control of excipients 
The excipients, L-Histidine, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Mannitol, Tween 80 (Polysorbate 80), 
Sucrose and WfI are described in Pharmacopoeias and are tested to meet the requirements of Ph. Eur., 
USP and JP as available. The validity of bacterial Endotoxin and Bioburden assays was verified for each 
excipient. 
Product specification 
In accordance with guideline ICH Q6B, specifications were set to support the release of rFIX drug product 
and are found suitable for its control. 
Questions related to the control of product-related impurities at Drug Product level have been 
appropriately addressed and solved. Also the tightening of the molecular size distribution limits for 
monomer, dimer and aggregates is considered acceptable. Additional information regarding the 
measurement of pro-FIX content has been submitted as requested. Observed discrepancies regarding the 
specification range for potency have been clarified.  
A description of the test methods utilised for the release analysis of rFIX Drug Product has been 
submitted, the validations of the analytical procedures were performed in conformance with the USP and 
European Pharmacopoeia guidelines. Details of the validation of analytical procedures have been 
provided.  
An improved rFIX activity method (clotting assay) has been implemented in response to detected OOS 
values during stability testing. The applicant gives information about the improvements which were 
implemented in the assay: in principal the mentioned points for an improvement of such a test is 
acceptable. In addition Baxter commits to investigate a further improvement of the FIX clotting assay, 
and, if necessary, will come back to the authorities 1 year after Commission Decision. In case of changes 
to the potency method, a variation for approval will be filed post-authorisation (see section 2.2.6). 
A summary of batch analysis data of 15 lots of rFIX Drug Product (3 lots of 250 IU, 3 lots of 500 IU, 4 lots 
of 1000 IU, 2 lots of 2000 IU, and 3 lots of 3000 IU) is presented in the dossier and demonstrate 
consistency of the manufacturing process.

Reference standards or materials 
An in-house rFIX reference standard (lot HP02R) has been established from a drug substance lot to 
measure the potency of rFIX Drug Product. The potency of the rFIX in-house standard (85 IU/mL) was 
assigned by one-stage clotting method using WHO 4th IS FIX Concentrate. In addition, a comparative 
study was also conducted to establish a statistical value for the average percent difference in potency due 
to the switch from the current plasma-derived in-house potency standard to the rFIX in-house potency 
standard by the same method. The stability of the rFIX reference standard was evaluated under 
accelerated degradation conditions to calculate its real time stability at ≤-20°C. The real time stability of 
this reference standard will be monitored for 7 years. The Company has submitted real time/real 
temperature data (to justify the approach for determination of the real time shelf-life and to clarify other, 
initially identified discrepancies. As requested specific protocols for establishment of a new reference 
material / standard have been provided and updated with respect to the N-glycan content determination 
taking the revised control strategy for the differently charged oligosaccharides into account. Authorities 
will be informed if an OOS event should occur and a new rFIX standard will be established in this case.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the drug product has been adequately described and complies with the 
requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). All dosage strengths are filled into 10 ml vials 
made of neutral glass, hydrolytic Type I. The closure system consists of butylrubber stoppers with 
fluororesin D Teflon film (grey) and aluminium crimp caps with polyproplyene disk (green). 
Stability of the product 
The submitted stability data sufficiently support the claimed shelf life of the drug product as described in 
the product information. The proposed shelf-life is 24 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C. Within the 24 
month period, the product may be stored at room temperature (up to 30°C) for up to 6 months. A shelf 
life of 3 hours at ≤25°C is claimed after reconstitution. 
The stability parameters are a subset of the drug product release parameters. The applicant presented 
real time/real temperature stability data with nine commercial lots (covering all dosage sizes) first stored 
at 5°C for 18 months followed by 6 months storage at 30°C/65% RH and 6 months storage at 25°C/60% 
RH. Further Baxter submitted stability data for the same lots at 5°C for 22 months followed by 2 months 
at 25°C/60%RH. 
The container/closure system used for the stability investigations is the same as that intended for 
commercial use. 
Drug product - water for injections (WfI) 
WfI (5 mL size) is manufactured by Hameln Pharmaceuticals GmbH. The manufacture of WfI is carried out 
in accordance with GMP and is adequately documented. In summary, the manufacturing of sWfI starts 
with cleaning and sterilisation of the equipment, compounding, filtration and filling of the vials. The vials 
are then sterilised in an autoclave and 100% inspected. The final labelling and packaging is performed by 
Baxter. 
WfI is in compliance with the requirements of the European Pharmacopeia, current edition. All quality 
control tests are performed by the manufacturer Hameln Pharmaceuticals according to Ph. Eur. current 
edition. 
The container closure system complies with the relevant Ph. Eur. Monographs and consists of glass vial 
(colourless glass, type I Ph. Eur. 6 ml, DIN Standard 8362 part 1) and a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber 
stopper, Ph. Eur.).

The submitted stability data support for the 5 ml fill size the claimed shelf life of 2 years at +2-8°C, 
including partial storage at up to +30°C for not more than 6 months. 
The basic stability studies were performed at the storage temperature of +5 ± 3°C, of +25 ± 2°C, and at 
+30 ± 2°C for 60 months, respectively and at +45 ± 2°C for 6 months. In addition, after storage at +5° 
± 2°C for 54 months, samples were transferred to +25°C ± 2°C / 60% RH for additional 6 months. To 
expand the acceptable storage temperatures, two additional stability studies are currently in progress: 
one batch is currently investigated at +30° ±2°C for 48 months and further three batches at +30° ±2°C 
/ 65% ± 5% RH for 60 months. All samples are stored inverted in the original containers material 
proposed for marketing. 
For all batches stored at 5°C stability data comply with the specifications and demonstrate good stability 
profiles for all test parameters. The samples are stable over the test period (60 months) including a partial 
room temperature storage (up to +25°C) for a period up to 6 months. 
Further information concerning the microbiological attributes, critical steps in the manufacture, analytical 
procedures used for quality control of WfI, and stability has been submitted as requested.  
Baxject II 
Baxject II has a needleless construction to avoid needle stick injuries. This device is currently used with 
licensed products. Both spikes (diluent and product side) are lubricated with silicone oil to reduce the 
penetration force while spiking through the rubber stopper. Baxject II device is intended for use with a 
single vial of Rixubis and sWfI only, therefore reconstituting and withdrawing a second vial into the 
syringe requires a second Baxject II device. 
BAXJECT II device was determined to be suitable for use with Rixubis based on the following: 
•  rFIX potency by clotting for all devices (and samples) were within specification limit of 80 – 120% 
•  Total protein values for all devices (and samples) were within specification limit of 80 – 120% 
•  The aggregate and dimer values were for all devices (and samples) were within specification limits. In 
addition, no increase in aggregate and dimers were observed. 
•  No degradation bands were seen by SDS-PAGE and Western blot 
The sub-visible particle counting by a very sensitive method (MFI) showed the particle count for ≥10 µm 
showed values above USP <788> for both the product and buffer even after electronic filter. However, 
visual imaging data showed that the particles were not protein, instead silicone (in both product and 
buffer). Therefore it is highly likely the protein particle complied with values within USP <788> limits. 
Initially raised issues with the sub-visible particles have been discussed and solved. 
Adventitious agents safety evaluation 
The US and EU regulations require adequate safety margins for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 
(TSE) agents in all medicinal products. The risk to rFIX with respect to TSE agents (i.e. prions) is 
minimized by the nature of the manufacturing process. In the pre-MCB stage of manufacturing process 
development FBS from countries with a controlled BSE risk was used. The MCB and WCB are stored in a 
serum-free medium. No animal- or human-derived materials are added during the manufacturing process 
or to the final container as excipients. 
Cell banks were extensively controlled. The strategy of the cell bank testing for viral contamination, as 
proposed by the applicant, is deemed compliant with the ICH Guideline on the Quality of Biotechnological 
Products (CPMP/ICH/295/95). No viral particles other than retroviral-like particles normally seen in these 
cell types were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 17/103 
 
 
 
The rFIX manufacturing process includes two dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps, SD treatment 
and  15nm  nanofiltration,  as  well  as  a  dedicated  ion  exchange  chromatography  step.  Viral  clearance 
studies were performed in small scale models. The design of these studies is deemed in compliance with 
CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline. The results show that the two dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps 
and the ion exchange chromatography contribute efficiently to viral clearance. In addition, robustness of 
both steps has been demonstrated.  
It is recommended as committed by the applicant to perform a virus clearance study with 
chromatography resin after the maximum cycle times (see 2.2.5). 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing 
guidelines. The information provided in the application demonstrates consistent batch-to-batch 
production of Rixubis achieving a well-defined quality for the drug substance and the drug product. The 
cell culture process, recovery and purification of the drug substance, nonacog gamma, are adequately 
controlled and validated. Appropriate drug substance specifications have been set. The drug substance 
has been adequately characterised using state-of the-art methods with regard to its physicochemical and 
biological characteristics. The manufacturing process of the drug product has been described and 
validated in sufficient detail. The quality of the drug product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. The data presented support the shelf-life proposed for Drug substance or Drug product. No 
excipients of human or animal origin are used in the product manufacture and there is no risk of 
contamination with viral or TSE agents by these ingredients.  
In summary no major objections have been raised and most of the raised other concerns in Module 3 have 
been appropriately addressed in the responses to requests for information during the procedure. 
Nevertheless, recommendations addressing the characterisation of charged variants by IEF, the 
improvement of the recombinant FIX clotting assay, and the virus validation studies have been included. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the data presented indicate that Rixubis is manufactured by a validated, controlled process 
taking into consideration relevant guidance documents. Batch release data confirm a product of 
consistent quality. The stability program is considered satisfactory. The results generated during the 
stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
The dependency of clotting assay results on the aPTT reagent used in the one-stage clotting assay (some 
reagents giving results 40% above the labelled potency) has been noted. As requested, the Company 
follows the proposal made in the revised version of the core SmPC for FIX products (under public 
consultation) and includes high level information in the Rixubis SmPC that plasma factor IX activity results 
can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the 
assay. This is also addressed in the RMP. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends points for further investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The primary and secondary pharmacodynamics of nonacog gamma were investigated in a number of in 
vitro and in vivo studies. Nonclinical studies included primary pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetic studies, single and repeat dose toxicity studies and one comparative immunogenicity 
study. Mouse models were used to test the pharmacodynamic effects of nonacog gamma; toxicology 
studies were performed in mice, cynomolgous monkeys, rats and rabbits by the iv route; pharmacokinetic 
studies were done in mice, rabbits and cynomolgous monkeys and safety pharmacology studies were 
carried out in rabbits and monkeys.  
The  recombinant  FIX  product  BeneFIX  and  the  plasma  derived  FIX  product  Mononine  were  used  as 
comparators in the preclinical studies. 
All pivotal nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted consistent with ICH Nonclinical Testing Guidelines 
and in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacological properties of nonacog gamma have been investigated in one in vitro study and in 
three in vivo FIX knock out mouse models (thromboelastography, tail tip bleeding, carotid occlusion).  
Safety pharmacology aspects have been studied in 2 rabbit stasis models and in one Cynomolgus monkey 
study. PD drug interaction studies have not been performed. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  in  vivo  haemostatic  effect  was  tested  in  the  thromboelastography,  tail  tip  bleeding  and  carotid 
occlusion mouse model of haemophilia B (F9 knock-out mice) compared to BeneFIX250 and Mononine.

Table 1: Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
These studies revealed a dose-dependent shortening of APTT-time (Activated Partial Prothrombin Time) 
in human, rat and Cynomolgus model systems demonstrating species cross-reactivity to rat and 
Cynomolgus with Rixubis; similar dose dependent efficacy and clot formation among Rixubis and the 
comparators; dose dependent efficacy in blood loss in the tail tip bleeding model.  
The results of the in vitro assays such as the thrombin generation assay, as well as the efficiency of 
activation by FXIa and FVIIa in the presence of tissue factor and the capacity to bind to phospholipid 
vesicles sufficiently support primary PD of nonacog gamma as discussed under Quality aspects  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies have not been submitted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Three  in  vivo  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  in  rabbits  and  monkeys  to  assess  the 
thrombogenic potential of nonacog gamma and its effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system. 
The highest dose tested (750 IU/kg bw) in animals with normal haemostasis was 10 times the intended 
maximum human prophylactic clinical dose (75 IU/kg).

Table 2: Overview Safety Pharmacology Studies 
Wessler score was used to measure thrombogenicity, this is based on 7-part ordinal scale (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 
3.5, 4), where 0 = no thrombus formation, 4 = high thrombus formation1 (Wessler S., Reimer S. M., 
Steps M. C. (1959): Biologic assay of a thrombosis-inducing activity in human serum. J. Appl. Physiol. 14, 
943-946). The Wessler scores obtained in the GLP conform study PV2420905 demonstrated that nonacog 
gamma  was not thrombogenic in NZW rabbits after intravenous bolus application, with a comparable 
Wessler score for pdFIX Mononine, and was even slightly lower for rFIX-comparator BeneFIX after 
applying a 10-fold human clinical dose. FIXa analysis showed that a slightly higher Wessler score for the 
rFIX comparator BeneFIX is the consequence of a higher FIXa content (0.009 IU/ml for nonacog gamma 
and 0.106 IU/ml for BeneFIX). This was confirmed by FIXa spiking experiments with nonacog gamma in 
NZW rabbits (Wessler score 0.5 for BeneFIX, and 0.42 after addition of 0.1272 IU/mL FIXa). No adverse 
clinical effects and no effects on blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, electrocardiogram or 
behaviour were observed in a GLP compliant telemetry study with cynomolgus monkeys. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted.

Absorption of nonacog gamma was evaluated following intravenous administration, which is the intended 
clinical route of administration. Pharmacokinetic assessments comprised FIX activity, maximum observed 
concentration (Cmax), terminal half-life (t 1/2), area under concentration versus time curve (AUC0-∞), AUC 
from zero to the last measured time point (AUC0-tlast), total body clearance (CL), volume of distribution at

Design:  Various  doses  (500,  1000  and  1500  IU/kg)  of  BAX326  were  determined  following  IV 
administration  in  SD  rats  and  compared  to  that  of  500  IU/kg  doses  of  two  marketed  FIX  products, 
BeneFIX and Mononine. 
Outcome:  A biphasic decay could be observed for all items tested, Dose proportionality was observed

Single Dose (IV) in Cynomolgus - Study No: CLEM 1933-015 
Design: Various doses (150, 300 and 450 IU/kg) of BAX326 were determined following IV administration 
in cynomolgus (2M/2F per group) and compared to that of 150 IU/kg doses of one marketed recombinant 
FIX product, BeneFIX. 
Outcome:  No clinical signs, no mortalities; bi-phasic decline in plasma concentrations of rFIX-antigen and 
rFIX-activity (t 1/2 9 - 15 hours and 9 - 11 hours); Dose proportionality in the range of 150-450 IU/kg; t 1/2

A single dose (IV) in mice (GLP Study No.: PV2380908) with the purpose to determine toxicity following 
a single IV administration at each test dose level, was performed using various doses (450, 700 and 4000 
IU/kg) of Rixubis IV in C57BL/6NCrl mice (5M/5F per group) and compared to that of 750 IU/kg doses of 
BeneFIX, Mononine and control solutions.  
No clinical signs of toxicity, no effects on body weight development over the 14 day recovery periodno 
effect on hematologic (hematocrit, platelet count) variables, no macro- or microscopic changes indicative 
of  thrombogenicity  or  toxicity  were  noted.  Rixubis  was  well  tolerated  and  no  signs  for  toxicity  were 
observed in the single dose toxicity study in mice with doses up to 4000 IU/kg. 
Escalating dose followed by a 28-day repeated dose IV (bolus) administration toxicity study in the 
cynomolgus monkey (GLP Study No.: 1933-012) with the purpose to determine whether a high dose with 
a several-fold safety margin over the anticipated clinical dose was tolerable and suitable for repeated 
application in the cynomolgus following IV (bolus) administrations was performed with doses of 200 and 
750 IU/kg administered to two males and two females for the escalating dose phase and two males and 
two females for the repeated dose phase. 
No treatment related changes were seen in the dose escalating dose phase. 
A transient increase of APTT and fibrinogen in one male with detectable titers for neutralizing and binding 
antibodies was seen in the repeated dose phase; the NOAEL was observed at 750 IU/kg.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Two repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and cynomolgus monkeys with daily IV dosing up 
to 750 IU/kg. The maximum treatment length was 28 days. These studies were performed in compliance 
with GLP.

Table 5: Local tolerance study in the rabbit following intravenous, intraarterial and perivenous injection 
Rixubis was well tolerated after IV and IA administration. Paravenous administration of nonacog gamma 
(both tested lots) as well as BeneFIX led to local tissue reactions. The reactions were similar for the rFIX 
products with comparable potency.  
Other toxicity studies 
Comparative immunogenicity in Balb/c Mice - Study No.: PV2430911 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  BAX  326  in  comparison  to  that  of 
BeneFIX. In addition, development of antibodies against product impurities like host cell proteins were 
analyzed. 
Table 6: Immunogenicity study after IV application in BALB/c Mice 
Anti-human FIX specific antibody development was observed after nonacog gamma treatment as well as 
after BeneFIX treatment. The highest anti-human FIX antibody titers were observed after BeneFIX 
treatment. No statistically significant differences in anti-human FIX antibody titres between treatment 
groups. No antibody development against potential impurities originating from the producing cell line 
(CHO protein) was observed. 
Excipients 
Excipients of Rixubis are sucrose, mannitol, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, L-histidine and polysorbate 
80. 
Four toxicity studies with Rixubis were conducted in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys with doses up to 
7500  U/kg  (see  table  3)  .  According  to  the  highest  volume  administered,  formulation  buffer  with  the 
excipients has been evaluated for adverse effects within these studies. Table 12 gives a summary about 
the toxicity studies with the highest exposure of animals with Rixubis excipients.

Table 7: Exposure of Mice, Rats and Monkeys in Toxicity Studies Compared with the Maximum Intended 
Human Clinical Dose of Rixubis 
Based on table 7, the exposure to the excipients in the three studies was 5.9 (mice), 4.0 (rats), and 3.3 
(monkeys) times higher than the maximal expected clinical exposure in humans. 
Histidine 
The acute toxicity of L-histidine (CAS 71-00-1) was reported to be low and in the grams/kg body weight 
range after i.v. administration to rodents. Animals received up to 138.6 mg/m2 (mice) of histidine without 
any toxic effects. 
Calcium Chloride 
Calcium chloride (CAS 10043-52-4; dihydrate CAS 10035-04-8) is widely used excipients with a low acute 
toxicity. Animals received up to 19.7 mg/m2 (mice) of calcium chloride without any toxic effects. 
Sodium Chloride 
Sodium chloride (CAS 7647-14-5) solutions are widely used for infusion with a concentration of 0.9% (9 
g/L). Therefore, the exposure to 133.1 mg/m2 is not considered to pose any risk. As expected, animals 
treated with up to 392.0 mg/m2 NaCl did not show any signs of toxicity. 
Mannitol 
Mannitol  (CAS  69-65-8)  is  a  sugar  currently  approved  and  marketed  as  Mannitol  injection,  USP  for 
irrigation and diuresis.  A typical dosage for use as a diuretic in humans is 50 mg/kg (2023 mg/m2)  and 
for acute kidney failure is 100 - 200 g or 1.4 - 2.9 g/kg (57 - 117 g/m2).  
In the single-dose toxicity study, mice were dosed with up to 895.8 mg/m2 mannitol in excipient controls 
with no effects attributable to mannitol.  
The intended human exposure of 152.1 mg/m2 mannitol with Rixubis is more than 53 times below the 
typical diuretic parenteral starting dose of mannitol in humans of 8092 mg/m2 (200 mg/kg).  
Sucrose 
Sucrose (C12H22O11; CAS 57-50-1) is a sugar that is recognized with GRAS status by the FDA. Sucrose 
is a substance of extremely low acute toxicity. Consumption of sucrose in large amounts or at frequent 
Assessment report

intervals  contributes  to  the  development  of  dental  caries,  an  adverse  effect  irrelevant  for  parenteral 
application. 
The  intended  human  exposure  of  90.9  mg/m2  from  the  Rixubis  dosing  is  not  considered  to  pose  any 
safety issue. 
Tween 80 
Tween  80  (Polysorbate  80,  CAS  9005-65-6),  a  non-ionic  surfactant  widely  used  as  an  emulsifier, 
dispersant, or stabilizer in foods, pharmaceutical preparations, and cosmetics. 
Tween 80 exposure due to Amiodarone treatment is 3182 times higher compared to that with Rixubis (see 
table 8). Tween 80 has been associated with drops in blood pressure in dogs (Intravenous Amiodarone 
and Tween 80) and has been associated with severe hypersensitivity reactions in some human patients 
using intravenous therapies with Tween 80 while appearing to be virtually non-toxic when ingested by 
humans.  
Table 8: Tween 80 Concentrations in IV Pharmaceuticals and the Resulting Human Exposure 
The  intended  human  clinical  exposure  in  the  BAX326  therapy  is  0.38  mg/m2.  This  exposure  is 
substantially less than in other currently marketed IV products and 23684 times lower than the Lowest 
Lethal Intravenous Dose (LDLo) in dogs of 9000 mg/m2. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant did not submit an environmental risk assessment. They justified the lack of the report by 
stating that according to the European Medicines Agency Guideline “Guideline on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use”, vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, 
proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted from the requirement to provide an ERA as part of the 
Marketing Authorization Application because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment. Therefore, the use, storage and disposal of nonacog gamma, a glycoprotein, does not 
pose a potential risk for the environment.

Nonacog gamma is a recombinant coagulation factor IX, it belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group: 
antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX (ATC code: B02BD04). 
Pharmacology 
One in vitro study and three in vivo studies characterized the haemostatic efficacy of Rixubis. The effects 
observed were comparable to other FIX products (rFIX Benefix, pdFIX Mononine).  
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was assessed in Cynomolgus monkey, rat and human 
plasma. The in vivo haemostatic effect was tested in the thromboelastography, tail tip bleeding and 
carotid occlusion mouse model of haemophilia B (F9 knock-out mice) compared to BeneFIX250 and 
Mononine. The in vitro study aimed to verify the functional properties of nonacog gamma to interact with 
coagulation system of cynomolgus monkeys, rats and humans and by that verifying their suitability for 
the toxicological assessment of BAX326.  
The in vivo studies were performed in three animal models using FIX ko mice to assess the efficacy of 
BAX326 in comparison with commercial recombinant FIX product, i.e. BeneFIX as well as with plasma 
derived product, i.e. Mononine. BAX326 was efficacious and a dose-dependent haemostatic effect was 
demonstrated with doses up to 75 IU/kg in the thromboelastography model and at 100 IU/kg in the 
tail-tip bleeding and the carotid occlusion model, respectively.  
Safety pharmacology comprised investigation of thrombogenicity in rabbits and cardiovascular and 
respiratory endpoints including behavior and appearance in Cynomolgus monkeys. Rixubis was not 
thrombogenic at a dose of 750 IU/kg in a rabbit stasis model (Wessler-Test). Rixubis did not cause any 
adverse clinical, respiratory, or cardiovascular effects up to 450 IU/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. No 
further CNS endpoints were investigated but it was concluded that there is no evidence of functional or 
histological indices suggesting a possible toxicity on the CNS, based on clinical experience with marketed 
rFIX products and pharmacological studies investigating the impact of nonacog gamma on the 
cardiovascular and respiratory system.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies showed systemic exposure in F9 knock-out mice, Sprague Dawley 
rats, and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Dose proportionality was observed in Cynomolgus monkeys, but not in rodents. Across all species, there 
was no gender-related difference in the extent of systemic exposure of rFIX antigen and rFIX activity and 
biphasic decay was observed for all items tested. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity studies submitted are considered appropriate for marketing authorization application of 
BAX326 as recombinant blood coagulation factor IX. Since the product is intended to be similar to 
BeneFIX, the approach to compare the toxicity profile of BAX326 with BeneFIX and with Mononine as 
plasma-derived FIX product is endorsed. Key elements of ICH S6 guideline pertaining to the selection of 
rodent and non-rodent species for acute toxicity and repeated dose toxicity have been followed. 
Single application of up to 4000 IU/kg to mice revealed no treatment related findings. GLP conform repeat 
dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and monkeys with IV dosing every other day (28 days 14 
applications). The limited duration of the studies is acceptable due to the species specific immunogenicity, 
although clinically chronic administration is intended. Administration of nonacog gamma up to 750 IU/kg 
was well tolerated. BeneFIX, (recombinant Factor IX marketed in the EU) was used as comparator.

In rats a slight increase in PT time in the 200 IU/kg Rixubis group in both sexes and an increase in APTT 
in the 200 IU/kg Rixubis group (in females only) was observed. Because of very low pre-dose values, the 
increased  values  are  still  within  the  range  of  normal  APTT  values  and  due  to  the  absence  of  any 
pathological clinical signs, these findings are not considered to have a negative impact on the coagulation 
system. 
Rixubis was well tolerated in single dose and repeated dose toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys up to doses of 7500 IU/kg (single dose) and 750 IU/kg (repeated application). No 
signs of adverse effects related to Rixubis have been observed in the non-clinical setting. The NOAEL was 
identified at 750 IU/kg - the highest doses tested (rats and Cynomolgus), which is 10 times higher than 
the maximum intended prophylactic clinical dose of 75 IU/kg in humans. 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, toxicokinetic analysis revealed that all animals in all dose groups were exposed 
to nonacog gamma; systemic exposure of rFIX-activity increased in an approximately dose-proportional 
manner  across  the  dose  range.  The  apparent  terminal  elimination  half-life,  total  body  clearance  and 
apparent volume of distribution of rFIX-activity were dose- and time independent. There was no apparent 
gender-related difference in the extent of systemic exposure of rFIX-activity. The pharmacokinetics of 
rFIX-activity  appeared  to  be  consistent  between  nonacog  gamma  and  the  licensed,  recombinant  FIX 
product (nonacog alfa; BeneFIX). 
An antigenicity study was performed in mice as well as one separate local tolerance study in rabbits.  
In rats, no binding anti-human FIX antibodies were detectable after the end of the treatment period on 
day 28 in any of the treatment groups. Low titres of binding antihuman FIX antibodies were detected after 
the recovery phase of treatment with 200 IU/kg nonacog gamma in 1/10 animals and after 750 IU/kg 
nonacog gamma in 2/10 animals. No neutralizing antibodies have been detected. 
In Cynomolgus, positive anti-FIX binding antibody responses were observed in two males receiving 200 
IU/kg/day BeneFIX, two males and one female (200 IU/kg/day Rixubis) and two males and one female 
(750  IU/kg/day  Rixubis).  Neutralizing  antibodies  were  confirmed  for  only  one  male  monkey  in  the 
BeneFIX group. 
No  effects  (macroscopically  and  histopathological)  on  the  reproductive  organs  neither  in  male  nor  in 
female rats and cynomolgus were seen. Recombinant FIX has been widely used clinically and no adverse 
effects concerning fertility have been reported.  
Based on results from the dose-escalation and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus, a no 
observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was identified at 750 IU/kg - the highest doses tested. This NOAEL 
was 10 times higher than the maximum intended prophylactic clinical dose of 75 IU/kg in humans. 
The immunogenicity of Rixubis was assessed in a comparative immunogenicity study against BeneFIX in 
Balb/c  Mice  (8  doses  at  weekly  intervals).  Additionally,  development  of  antibodies  against  product 
impurities  like  host  cell  proteins  were  analysed.  Immunogenicity  of  Rixubis  was  comparable  to  the 
recombinant FIX. Furthermore no development of antibodies against CHO proteins was observed. 
Local tolerance of nonacog gamma was evaluated in a separate local tolerance study after IV, IA and 
paravenous injections in rabbits. Rixubis was well tolerated after IV and IA application at potencies of 
approximately 2000 and 3000 IU/vial. Paravenous application of Rixubis caused local tissue reactions 
comparable to BeneFIX.  
There is no in vitro or in vivo evidence that rFIX has biologic properties other than those similar to 
endogenous FIX. For these reasons and in accordance with the ICH S6 guideline, no investigations on 
carcinogenicity, fertility impairment, and fetal development have been conducted. The omission of 
studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity is justified, in line 
with ICH S6 (R1) guideline for preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 33/103 
 
 
 
which states that “the range and type of genotoxicity studies routinely conducted for pharmaceuticals are 
not applicable to biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals and therefore are not needed.” 
No reproductive testing has been conducted for Rixubis. According to the ICH Guideline S6 (R1) - 
preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998) 
‘The need for reproductive/developmental toxicity studies is dependent upon the product, clinical 
indication and intended patient population’. Haemophilia A is a hereditary sex linked disease, which 
generally only affects men. Plasma derived FIX and rFIX have been widely used clinically for many years 
with no signs of adverse effects concerning fertility. As such, separate reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies for nonacog gamma are not expected to add any clinically relevant information. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. Adverse effects on fertility, postnatal 
development and reproduction as well as teratogenic effects are not expected in humans. Based on the 
rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy 
and  breast-feeding  is  not  available.  Therefore,  factor  IX  should  be  used  during  pregnancy  and 
breast-feeding only if clearly indicated (see section  4.6 of the  SmPC). There is no information on the 
effects of rFIX on fertility. 
Rixubis  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  hypersensitivity  to  any  of  the  excipients  (listed  in  SmPC 
section 6.1.) From the non-clinical testing the excipients warrant no specific concerns, and exposure to 
Polysorbate 80 is substantially less than the Lowest Lethal Intravenous Dose (LDLo) in dogs and less than 
other currently marketed IV products however, due to its known potential for hypersensitivity reactions 
the risk is covered in the SmPC and PL by the above contra-indication.  
The  applicant  has  not  performed  an  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  in  accordance  with  the 
“Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  the  medicinal  products  for  human  use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) – proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant 
risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies provided evidence that Rixubis demonstrated clear haemostatic 
efficacy. Several studies confirmed the comparability of the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic 
properties of Rixubis to commercially available FIX products. Regarding toxicology, no signs of adverse 
effects relating to Rixubis have been observed. The NOAEL was considered to be 750 IU/kg/day in rats 
and monkeys – the highest doses tested. No safety concerns in relation to human use have been 
identified. 
The non-clinical programme submitted in support of the Marketing Authorisation application for Rixubis 
is sufficient. Relevant information and recommendations have been included in the SmPC sections 4.4, 
4.6, 5.3.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK characteristics of BAX326 were investigated in two clinical studies (see table 9): 
•  Study 250901: Comparison of the PK of BAX326 with the PK of a commercial rFIX (BeneFix) in 
PTPs >12 years of age 
•  Study 251101: PK of BAX326 in PTPs 0-12 years of age 
In addition, in the surgery study 251002, IR was evaluated for all subjects and additional PK parameters 
only for subjects requiring major surgery. 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
Validation of Bioanalytical and Immunogenicity Testing Procedures 
FIX 1-stage clotting assay: 
A validation of the factor IX one-stage clot activity assay was conducted in order to assess precision, 
accuracy, selectivity, stability and dilution capabilities of the assay to measure Baxter's recombinant FIX 
product (BAX326) when tested at three working dilutions (1: 10, 1:20 and 1 :40) in imidazole buffer. The 
assay measures FIX activity using a modified activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) based on an 
8-point calibration curve consisting of normal pooled reference plasma diluted with imidazole buffer. 
Validation was performed with recombinant FIX in the matrix of immuno-depleted FIX deficient plasma. 
Validation  samples  with  6  different  concentrations,  covering  the  expected  range  of  the  clinical  study 
samples were prepared. For precision and accuracy, the validation samples were run in 6 independent 
assay runs. Based on all validation data it was concluded that the method is valid for bioanalytical analysis 
of FIX activity. 
FIX Antigen ELISA 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 36/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIX antigen was analyzed with a commercially available ELISA test kit (Asserachrom IX:Ag, Diagnostica 
Stago, Asnieres, France). The assay is calibrated with a reference material, calibrated against the WHO 
standard.  An  8-point  reference  curve  is  prepared  and  unknown  samples  are  read  from  this  curve. 
Validation was performed by spiking normal pooled human plasma into immuno-depleted FIX deficient 
plasma. Five different validation samples covering LLOQ up to a high concentration of FIX were prepared 
and measured in 6 different assay runs (precision and accuracy). 
FIX inhibitory antibodies 
Inhibitory (neutralising) antibodies to FIX are measured with a Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda 
assay.  The  validation  was  performed  using  commercially  available  FIX  inhibitor  plasma  (Affinity 
Biologicals, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada). Three validation samples with titers at the LLOQ, mid and high 
concentration were prepared and analysed in 6 separate assay runs. Based on all validation data it was 
concluded that the method is valid for the determination of neutralising anti-FIX antibodies. 
Binding antibodies to FIX, to Furin and to CHO protein was tested by relevant validated ELISA assays. All 
assays were validated with regards to inter- and intra-assay precision, specificity, linearity and 
robustness according to respective guidelines, Robustness was tested by analysing positive control 
samples that underwent five freeze/thaw cycles.

Pivotal Study 250901 
This is a randomized, blinded, controlled, crossover PK Study of BAX326 and a commercial rFIX used as 
a comparator, administered as an IV infusion.  
Subjects 
Previously treated non-bleeding patients (with a minimum of 150 EDs) suffering from severe (FIX level 
<1%) or moderately severe (FIX level 1-2%) haemophilia B who were 12 to 65 years of age. 
Design 
Part 1 (PK part) was a randomized, blinded, controlled, crossover study to compare the PK parameters of 
BAX326 with BeneFIX in 27 subjects (26 evaluable). The data of the first 16 subjects who completed Part 
1 were analysed for the presence of safety signals and reviewed by the independent DMC. In addition, the 
proposed dose to be used in Part 2 was confirmed by the DMC (per Protocol Amendment 2). Subjects were 
to be treated with a commercially available FIX concentrate other than BAX326 between the 2 infusions

in Part 1, as required. Thrombotic markers were also to be assessed at specified time points in Part 1. Part 
3 was an open-label, uncontrolled repeat evaluation of the PK parameters of BAX326 after 26 ± 1 weeks 
of treatment in Part 2 in the 27 subjects who participated in Part 1. Subjects had to have a minimum of 
30  EDs  to  BAX326  at  the  time  of  the  PK  assessment  in  Part  3.  Thrombotic  markers  were  also  to  be 
assessed at specified time points. Subjects who had not been exposed to BAX326 for a total of 50 days 
after completion of Part 3 were to continue receiving BAX326 until they had accumulated at least 50 EDs. 
Treatment 
In Part 1, subjects were to receive 2 infusions each, 1 infusion with BAX 326 and 1 infusion with BeneFIX, 
at a dose of 75 ± 5 IU/kg each in a randomized order.  
The dose to be administered was calculated as 75 (IU) multiplied by patient body weight (kg). There was 
a minimum wash-out period of 5 days, preferably 7 days, prior to and between the PK infusions and the 
subject had to be in a non-bleeding stage. The PK evaluation had to be repeated if more than 28 calendar 
days elapsed between the 72 hour post-infusion time point of Infusion 1 and Infusion 2, or if the subject 
started bleeding during the 72 hour post-infusion time period. 
Between Infusions 1 and  2, subjects were to be treated as needed with a commercially available FIX 
concentrate other than BAX 326 with a dose regimen as determined by the investigator. 
All 27 subjects who participated in Part 1 were to enter Part 3 after 26 ± 1 weeks of treatment in Part 2 
with a minimum of 30 EDs to BAX 326. Subjects participating in Part 3 were to be infused with a single 
dose  of  75  ±  5  IU/kg  of  BAX  326.  There  had  to  be  a  minimum  wash-out  period  of  at  least  5  days, 
preferably 7 days, between the last infusion in Part 2 of the study and the infusion for the repeat PK study, 
and the subject had to be in a non-bleeding stage. The PK evaluation could be repeated if the subject 
started bleeding during the 72 hour post-infusion time period 
PK endpoints 
Primary PK endpoint: To determine PK equivalence of BAX326 with a commercially available rFIX product 
used as a comparator, as measured by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 
0 to 72 hours post-infusion (AUC0-72 h /dose) after a single dose of 75 ± 5 IU/kg 
Secondary PK endpoints: AUC0-∞ /dose (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 
time 0 to infinity), MRT (mean residence time), CL (clearance), IR (incremental recovery), T1/2 
(elimination phase half-life), Vss (volume of distribution at steady state), and IR over time. 
FIX activity was measured using a one-stage clotting assay. 
The  principal  objective  of  Part  1  was  to  demonstrate  PK  equivalence  of  BAX  326  with  BeneFIX  as 
measured by the AUC0-72h/dose with a single dose of 75 ± 5 IU/kg. 
The  PK  parameters  to  be  assessed  in  Parts  1  and  3  were:  AUC  0-72  h/dose  (area  under  the  plasma 
concentration versus time curve from 0 to 72 hours post-infusion), AUC0-∞ /dose (area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity), MRT (mean residence time), CL (clearance), IR, 
T1/2 (elimination phase half-life) and Vss (volume of distribution at steady state). In addition, IR at 30 
minutes post-infusion of BAX326 was also to be assessed over time in Part 2. 
Blood samples for the PK evaluation were collected at the following time-points: 15±5 min, 30±5 min, 1 
hour ±5 min, 3 hours ±10 min, 6 hours ±15 min, 9 hours ±30 min, 24 hours ±2 hours, 36 hours ±2 
hours, 48 hours ±2 hours, 60 hours ±2 hours and 72 hours ±2 hours. 
Results

PK equivalence of BAX326 and BeneFIX has been established, as the 90% CI for AUC0-72h /dose (and 
also for AUC0-72 h) – in both the PKPPAS and the PKFAS – is contained completely within the margins of 
equivalence defined as 80% to 125%.

PK Parameters - BAX326 Pilot vs. Commercial Product 
Additional analyses were prepared for the FAS comparing the PK parameters a) within subjects before and 
after switching CTM, and b) between subjects who received one versus the other type of CTM. 
Twenty-seven (27) out of 28 subjects in Part 1 received pilot scale material and 23 out of 25 subjects in 
Part 3 received commercial scale material. The comparison was performed in the 22 subjects who 
received both pilot (Part 1) and commercial (Part 3) BAX326 product. The Part 1/Part 3-ratio of PK 
parameters shows that higher AUC, IR and Cmax values were observed with the commercial product. The

Part 1/Part 3-ratio of MRT, half-life and CL demonstrates very similar values for both pilot and commercial 
products. 
IR over time determined at 30 min post-infusion was assessed separately for subjects who received 
BAX326 pilot product and subjects who received BAX326 commercial product. Mean and median IR values 
were comparable for pilot and commercial product. 
Surgery Study 251002  
PK assessments: IR at 15 ± 5 minutes following loading dose prior to surgery (for all subjects); AUC0-72 
h/dose, total AUC/dose, MRT, CL, IR, T1/2, and Vss – only for subjects ≥ 12 years of age  undergoing 
major elective surgery who did not undergo a PK assessment in the pivotal study 250901 and for newly 
entering subjects requiring major surgery. 
The 7 subjects for whom pre-surgical PK parameters were calculated from PK assessments in the surgery 
study received a mean (STD) dose of 75.75 (± 2.52) IU/kg of BAX326 (range: 71.80-78.79 IU/kg). The 
mean (STD) values (+ range) of the individual PK parameters were: 
• AUC0-72 h/dose (IU hr/dL : IU/kg): 19.77 (± 7.88) (range: 14.46-37.26) 
• AUC0-inf/dose (IU hr/dL : IU/kg): 21.74 (± 8.94) (range: 16.62-41.73)

Paediatric Study 251101: A Phase 2/3, Prospective, Uncontrolled, Multicentre Study 
Evaluating Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity in Previously Treated 
Paediatric Patients < 12 years With Severe (FIX level <1%) or Moderately Severe (FIX level 
1-2%) Haemophilia B 
In the open-label, uncontrolled paediatric Study 251101, subjects were to receive an initial infusion with 
BAX326 at a dose of 75 ± 5 IU/kg for PK assessment. All 23 subjects in the PKFAS/FAS received the initial 
PK infusion, at a mean dose of 75.50 (± 3.016) IU/kg (median: 75.25 IU/kg; range: 70.0-83.6 IU/kg). 
There were 2 cohorts based on the age of the subjects: <6 years (n=11) and 6 to <12 years (n=12). 
Subjects in the <6-year age cohort (n=11) received median and mean (± STD) doses of BAX326 of 75.25 
IU/kg and 74.86 ± 2.581 IU/kg, respectively (range: 70.4-79.3 IU/kg). Subjects in the 6-to-<12-year 
age cohort (n=12) received median and mean (± STD) doses of 75.14 IU/kg and 76.10 (± 3.366) IU/kg, 
respectively (range: 70.0-83.6 IU/kg). 
Within each cohort, subjects were randomized to one of 2 blood sampling sequences for the PK 
assessment to reduce the burden of frequent blood sampling on the individual subject. There were a total 
of 7 post-infusion time points over 72 hours for taking blood samples for the PK evaluation. These were 
to be divided between 2 subjects, with the result that there were 4 post-infusion time points per subject 
PK endpoints (secondary endpoints): AUC0-∞ /dose, total AUC/dose, MRT, CL, IR, T1/2, Vss, IR over 
time.

All 23 male subjects underwent an initial pharmacokinetic evaluation of Rixubis in a non-bleeding state as 
part of the combined phase 2/3 paediatric study. Subjects were randomised to one of two blood sampling 
sequences to reduce the burden of frequent blood draws on the individual subjects. The mean (± SD) and 
median dose of Rixubis in the full analysis set (n=23) was 75.50 ± 3.016 and 75.25 IU/kg, respectively, 
with a range of 70.0 to 83.6 IU/kg. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from factor IX 
activity measurements in blood samples obtained up to 72 hours following the infusion.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of Rixubis were investigated in trials 250901 and 251101. In trial 250901 
PTPs ≥12 years of age were included and in trial 250101 children <12 years of age were included. Study 
250901 was a randomised, blinded, controlled, crossover pharmacokinetic study of Rixubis and a 
comparator conducted in non-bleeding male subjects (≥15 years of age) as part of the combined 
phase 1/3 pivotal study. The subjects received either of the products as a single intravenous infusion. The 
Assessment report

mean (± SD) and median dose of Rixubis in the per protocol analysis set (n=25) were 74.69±2.37 and 
74.25 IU/kg, respectively, with a range of 71.27 to 79.38 IU/kg. The pharmacokinetic parameters were 
calculated from factor IX activitiy measurements in blood samples obtained up to 72 hours following each 
infusion. 
The pharmacokinetic evaluation was repeated for Rixubis in an open-label, uncontrolled study with 
Rixubis in male subjects who participated in the initial PK crossover study and had received prophylaxis 
with Rixubis for 26±1 weeks (mean ± SD) and accumulated at least 30 exposure days (EDs) to Rixubis. 
The Rixubis dose range in the repeat pharmacokinetics study was 64.48 to 79.18 IU/kg (n=23). 
PK endpoints as well as blood sampling time points were according to the applicable guideline (Guideline 
on Clinical Investigation of Recombinant and Human Plasma-Derived Factor IX Products, 
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009). Furthermore, a sufficient number of patients was included into the PK 
parts of the clinical studies. In study 250901 PK equivalence of BAX 326 compared to BeneFix - a licensed 
recombinant FIX product - was shown as the 90%CI for AUC0-72h/dose as well as for AUC0-72h 
(1067.81±238.42 IU.hr/dL) were within the margins of 80% to 125% (in both the PK per protocol 
population and the PK full analysis set). All other PK parameters are comparable between BAX326 and 
BeneFix. 
Incremental recovery 30 minutes after infusion was determined for all subjects in the combined 
phase 1/3 study at exposure day 1, at their week 5, 13, and 26 visits, and at the time of study 
completion or termination, if it did not coincide with the week 26 visit. The data demonstrate that the 
incremental recovery is consistent over time. 
A comparative PK study in PTPs ≥12 years included three adolescent subjects aged 12, 13 and 15, thus 
a minimum of PK data in older paediatric patients comparing Rixubis with BeneFix is available. 
All 23 male paediatric subjects in trial 250101 underwent an initial pharmacokinetic evaluation of Rixubis 
in a non-bleeding state as part of the combined phase 2/3 paediatric study. Subjects were randomised to 
one of two blood sampling sequences to reduce the burden of frequent blood draws on the individual 
subjects. The mean (± SD) and median dose of Rixubis in the full analysis set (n=23) 
was 75.50 ± 3.016 and 75.25 IU/kg, respectively, with a range of 70.0 to 83.6 IU/kg. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from factor IX activity measurements in blood samples 
obtained up to 72 hours following the infusion. 
Incremental recovery 30 minutes after infusion was determined for all subjects in the combined 
phase 2/3 study at the initial pharmacokinetic evaluation (exposure day 1), at week 5, 13, and 26 visits, 
and at the time of study completion or termination, if it did not coincide with the week 26 visit. The data 
demonstrate that the incremental recovery is consistent over time across all paediatric age groups.  
In general, PK parameters of BAX326 seem to be comparable with published data of other FIX products. 
The guideline requirement to employ at least 3 different lots is fulfilled within trial 250901 including a 
comparative analysis for all PK parameters according to lot. During the course of clinical study 250901 
patients were switched from receiving BAX326 pilot to BAX326 commercial product, however, the 
comparability of pilot clinical batches and commercial clinical batches was further investigated and 
satisfactorily demonstrated. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of FIX are closely associated to its PK parameters, therefore it was not 
necessary to conduct separate studies on clinical pharmacodynamics. 
The BWP noted the dependency of clotting assay results on the aPTT reagent used in the one-stage 
clotting assay (some reagents giving results 40% above the labelled potency). As requested, the 
Applicant follows the proposal made in the revised version of the core SmPC for FIX products (under 
public consultation) and includes high level information in the Rixubis SmPC that plasma factor IX activity 
results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in 
the assay.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  aspects  of  nonacog  gamma  are  adequately  addressed  and  fulfil  the 
requirements to support marketing authorization of Rixubis. All available information has been reflected 
within the SmPC.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The haemostatic efficacy of Rixubis was investigated in three open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre 
studies: (see table  9) 
250901, efficacy in 73 PTPs ≥12, 14 patients included in the on-demand arm and 59 in the prophylactic 
arm with treatment of break-through bleeds. 
251101, efficacy in 23 PTPs <12 (11<6y; 12≥6y), prophylactic setting with treatment of break-through 
bleeds. 
251002, efficacy in the surgical setting, 11 major and 3 minor surgical interventions in 14 PTPs ≥12 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
 Dose-finding studies have not been performed. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 250901  
This was a prospective, multicenter phase 1/3 study in 3 parts investigating PK, efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of BAX326 in PTPs ≥ 12 years with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. 
Methods 
-  Part  1 was a randomized, blinded, controlled, crossover study to compare the PK parameters of a 
single dose BAX326 (75 ±5 IU/kg) with those of the same dose of a commercial recombinant FIX (rFIX= 
Benefix:  75 ±5  IU/kg)  in  27 subjects  (26  evaluable)  and  to  determine  PK  equivalence.  Thrombotic 
markers were also assessed at specified time points. 
- Part 2 was an open-label, uncontrolled study of the haemostatic efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and 
HR QoL of BAX326 over 6 months with twice weekly prophylactic infusions with BAX326 or at least 50 EDs 
to BAX326, whichever occurred last, in 60 subjects in order to have 50 evaluable subjects (prophylactic 
cohort).   
- Part 3 was an open-label, uncontrolled repeat PK study with BAX326 (single dose of 75 ±5 IU/kg) in the 
subjects who participated in Part 1 and had been treated for 26 ± 1 weeks in Part 2 having accumulated 
at least 30 EDs to BAX326. Thrombotic markers were also assessed at specified time points.

Treatments 
The dose for prophylactic treatment was 50 IU/kg twice weekly, ranging from 40-60 IU/kg (up to 75 
IU/kg permitted if necessary). 
The following guidance was given for determining the dose for treatment of BEs. The FIX level was not to 
fall below the given plasma activity level in the corresponding period. 
The required units were to be calculated according to the following formula:  Body weight (kg) x desired 
FIX rise (% or IU/dL) x {reciprocal of observed recovery}. 
Given an anticipated recovery of 0.8 [IU/dl]/[IU/kg], the required units were to be calculated using the 
following formula: Body weight (kg) x desired FIX rise (% or IU/dL) x 1.3 IU/kg. 
Objectives 
The objective of Part 1 of the study was to compare the PK parameters of BAX326 with those of BeneFIX 
and to determine PK equivalence (See Clinical Pharmacology section). Thrombotic markers were also to 
be determined at specified time points. Part 2 of the study was to assess the haemostatic efficacy, safety, 
and  immunogenicity  of  BAX326  and  HR  QoL  in  those  subjects  receiving  BAX326  for  prevention  and 
treatment of BEs as described in the following objectives: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
To monitor IR of BAX326 over time 
To evaluate the haemostatic efficacy of BAX326 in the management and prevention of acute BEs for 
a period of 6 months 
To evaluate safety in terms of BAX326-related AEs, as well as clinically significant changes in routine 
laboratory parameters (hematology/clinical chemistry) and vital signs 
To evaluate immunogenicity following a minimum of 50 EDs to BAX326 
To evaluate changes in health-related quality of life (HR QoL) and health resource use 
The objective of Part 3 was to re-evaluate the PK parameters for BAX326 after a period of 6 months of 
treatment, in 27 subjects who had accumulated at least 30 EDs to BAX326, and to compare them with 
those determined in the same subjects who participated in Part 1. Thrombotic markers were also to be 
determined at specified time points. 
Outcomes/endpoints

The  efficacy  endpoints  consisted  of  primary  and  secondary  PK  endpoints  (as  discussed  at  the 
Pharmacokinetics  section)  and  haemostatic  efficacy  endpoints.  The  following  haemostatic  efficacy 
endpoints were assessed during open-label prophylactic or on-demand treatment with BAX326: 
- 
Treatment of bleeding episodes (BEs): 
  Number of infusions per BE  
  Overall haemostatic efficacy rating (excellent, good, fair, none) at resolution of bleed 
  Overall  haemostatic  efficacy  ratings  performed  at  12  ±  1  and  24  ±  1  h  time  points  as 
exploratory endpoints. 
Table 13: Rating scale for treatment of bleeding episodes 
Rating scale for treatment of bleeding episodes 
Excellent 
Full  relief  of  pain  and  cessation  of  objective  signs  of  bleeding  (e.g.  swelling, 
tenderness,  and  decreased  range  of  motion  in  the  case  of  musculoskeletal 
haemorrhage) after a single infusion. No additional infusion is required for the 
control of bleeding. Administration of further infusions to maintain haemostasis 
would not affect this scoring. 
Good 
Definite  pain  relief  and  /or  improvement  in  signs  of  bleeding  after  a  single 
infusion. Possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution. 
Fair 
Probable and/or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding 
after a single infusion. Required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution. 
None 
No improvement or condition worsens.

- 
Prophylaxis: ABR; Prophylaxis: Number of bleeding episodes beginning within 24 and 48 hours of an 
infusion as exploratory endpoint 
Consumption of BAX326:  
  Number of infusions and weight-adjusted consumption per month and per year. 
  Weight-adjusted consumption per event (for prophylaxis and on-demand). 
The following safety endpoints were assessed throughout the study: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Development of inhibitory and total binding antibodies to factor IX 
Development of antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) proteins and rFurin 
Occurrence of severe allergic reactions, eg, anaphylaxis

Sample size 
Sample Size for Part 1: PK Equivalence Test 
The required sample size for PK equivalence test (part 1) was estimated to be 26 evaluable subjects. In 
order to allow for a minimum of 15% dropout rate, a total of 31 patients were randomized in Part 1. The 
sample size estimate was calculated for a Type-1 (α) error level of 0.05 and a Type-II (β) error level of 
0.10 or 90% power, under the assumption that the true (population) means are equivalent. The within 
subject variability used (the square root of mean square error = 0.233) was estimated by increasing the 
variance observed in previous studies of Factor VIII by 10%. 
Sample Size Considerations for Inhibitor Formation 
A sample size of 54 evaluable subjects on prophylactic treatment was estimated for Part 2 to ensure that 
the upper limit of the 95% CI of the rate of subjects with an inhibitor was less than 10% if no or 1 subject 
developed inhibitors in the study. 
In order to allow for a 10% dropout rate, a total of about 60 subjects were to participate in Part 2. 
Sample Size Considerations for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
An additional cohort of 15-20 subjects was to be enrolled to evaluate the haemostatic efficacy of BAX326 
in the treatment of BEs in subjects receiving on-demand treatment only. This cohort was not intended to 
be used in comparison to the prophylaxis cohort, but to ensure adequate data on haemostatic efficacy of 
BAX326 in the treatment of BEs. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were to be randomized to receive one of the following 2 PK infusion sequences: (1) BAX 
326 followed by BeneFIX or (2) BeneFIX followed by BAX 326, with equal allocation in study Part 1. Using 
a  centralized  block  randomization  scheme,  the  number  of  subjects  in  each  infusion  sequence  was 
balanced. Parts 2 and 3 of the study were non- randomized, open label. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 51/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
Subjects and investigators were only blinded in the crossover PK assessment in Part 1 of the study; Parts 
2 and 3 of the study were non- randomized,  open label.  
Statistical methods 
A Statistical Analysis plan was compiled. Three interim safety analyses were performed. The first interim 
safety review was performed by a DMC Safety Review Meeting, after 16 subjects had completed the PK 
evaluation of Part 1. The purpose was to ensure the safety of the IP and to confirm the proposed dose to 
be used in Part 2. A second interim safety review was performed after 11 subjects had completed Part 3 
and had been evaluated for haemostatic efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity for a period of 50 EDs to 
enable the start of a clinical trial in children less than 12 years of age. The third interim safety review (full 
analysis) was introduced per Amendment 6; 50 subjects were to have completed Part 2 and had to be 
evaluated for haemostatic efficacy, safety and immunogenicity for a period of 50 EDs to BAX326 or 6 
months, whichever occurred last.  
Analysis Sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was to comprise of all subjects who received at least 1 infusion during the 
study. The Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Set (PKFAS) was to comprise all subjects who were randomized 
and received at least 1 infusion and who provided acceptable data for PK analysis. 
The Pharmacokinetic Per Protocol Analysis Set (PKPPAS) was defined as a subset of the PKFAS, subjects 
who met the following additional criteria were to be included in the PKPPAS: as randomized and treated 
according  to  the  randomization  scheme,  received  both  of  the  assigned  infusions,  and  had  no  major 
violation affecting the PK period of the study. The analysis performed for PK parameters in Part 1 was to 
be  presented  for  the  PKFAS  as  well  as  for  the  PKPPAS.  The  analysis  for  the  haemostatic  efficacy 
endpoints,  i.e.,  analysis  of  annualized  bleed  rate,  analysis  of  treatment  of  BEs  and  analysis  of 
consumption of BAX326, was to be performed on the FAS. Also, the analysis of safety endpoints was to be 
performed on the FAS. 
Analysis of Annualized Bleed Rate 
Annualized Bleed Rate (ABR) during prophylaxis and on-demand treatment in Part 2 was to be calculated 
as (Number of bleeding episodes/observed treatment period in days) * 365.25 and was to be compared 
to the ABR of a historical control. A meta-analytic approach was to be used to summarize the (annualized) 
bleed  rates  with  on-demand  infusions.  The  overall  mean  from  the  meta-analysis  (μ1)  assumed  to  be 
distributed N(μ1, SE1), was to be compared to the mean bleed rate under prophylactic regimen. The 
estimated mean μ2 was assumed to be distributed N(μ2, SE2). The null hypothesis μ1 = μ2 was to be 
tested against the one-sided alternative μ1 > μ2 using a z-test at one-sided 2.5% of significance level, for 
testing the bleeding reduction during a prophylactic regimen, using the formula: 
Analysis of Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
The efficacy of bleeding treatment of BAX 326 was to be summarized. This included overall haemostatic 
efficacy rating at resolution of bleed, and the number of infusions and total weight-adjusted dose per 
bleeding  episode,  by  anatomical  site  (joint/non-joint),  cause  (spontaneous/injury),  severity  (minor, 
moderate,  major,  and  life/limb-threatening),  and  treatment  regimen  (prophylaxis  and  on-demand 
treatment).  By  Amendment  1  to  the  study  protocol  the  assessment  time  point  for  the  main  overall 
haemostatic efficacy rating for the treatment of bleeding episodes was specified to be at resolution of

bleed.  The  overall  haemostatic  efficacy  ratings  performed  at  the  12±1  and  24±1  h  time  points  were 
exploratory. 
Safety Endpoints 
Frequency  counts  and  percentages  were  to  be  calculated  for  the  following  variables:  occurrence  of 
inhibitory  and  total  binding  antibodies  to  FIX,  occurrence  of  antibodies  to  CHO  proteins  and  rFurin, 
occurrence  of  severe  allergic  reactions,  occurrence  of  thrombotic  events  and  occurrence  of  clinically 
significant changes in thrombogenic markers. 
Missing Data 
If a subject’s weight was missing from any infusion record, the subject’s last recorded weight was to be 
used to calculate the weight-adjusted dose. 
Otherwise, no techniques were employed to adjust for missing data.

There  have  been  7  amendments  to  the  study  protocol,  with  3  global  amendments  and  4  local 
amendments specific to the US and/or Japan. 
A total of 369 deviations were reported during the study. Of these, 37 were considered major deviations 
the majority of which concerned IP administration (e.g. wrong dose, 2 lots instead of one lot per infusion, 
1000IU vials instead of 500IU vials in the PK part, infusion rate over 4mL/min). 
Baseline data 
All analyzed subjects were male.  
The  median  age  of  all  73  subjects  in  the  FAS  was  33  years  (range  12-59  years);  there  were  three 
paediatric subjects aged 12, 13, and 15 years.  
Most  subjects  were  white  (83.6%);  the  rest  were  Japanese  (6.8%),  Latin  American/Mestizo  (6.8%), 
Black or African American (1.4%) and Arabic (1.4%).  
Thirty-nine (53.4%) subjects had a FIX activity level < 1%; while 34 (46.6%) subjects had a FIX activity 
level of 1-2%. FIX antigen levels were ≥ 1% in the majority of subjects (69.9%), with levels ≥ 40 % in 
30.1% of subjects.  
A missense mutation was diagnosed in 45.2% of subjects through genetic testing, followed by a nonsense 
mutation in 19.2%.  
The majority of subjects (87.7%) had arthropathy at screening; 1-2 target joints were present in 41.1% 
of subjects; 12.3% of subjects had 3-4 target joints and a further 12.3% of subjects had > 4 target joints.  
Only 13 (17.8%) of subjects had received prophylactic treatment prior to enrolment, whereas 27 (37%) 
had received on-demand treatment only and the remainder (33 subjects, 45.2%) both.  
The most frequently reported previous FIX product used (in 15.1% of subjects) was the plasma-derived 
FIX product Immunine, manufactured and marketed by Baxter. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 86 subjects have been enrolled in the study. Of these, 31 were enrolled for participation in Parts 
1-3, 39 in the prophylactic cohort of Part 2 and 15 in the on-demand cohort of Part 2; one subject was not 
assigned to any study cohort. Of 73 subjects who received IP, 28 were treated in Parts 1-3, and 31 were 
treated  in  the  prophylactic  cohort  and  14  in  the  on-demand  cohort  of  Part  2.  A  total  of  69  subjects 
completed the protocol (Parts 1-3: 26, prophylactic cohort: 29, on-demand cohort: 14). The following 
data sets were analyzed: 
-  Pharmacokinetic Per Protocol Analysis Set (PKPPAS) – n=25: comprises 25 subjects who participated 
in Parts 1-3 and completed Part 1 without any major protocol deviation  
-  PK  Full  Analysis  Set  (PKFAS)  –  n=28:  comprises  28  subjects  who  participated  in  Parts  1-3  and 
completed Part 1; 3 subjects had a major protocol deviation in Part 1 (Subjects 090002, 310001 and 
520001) 
-  Full Analysis Set (FAS) – n=73: comprise all 73 subjects who were exposed to IP. Within the FAS, 
subjects were further analyzed by the type of treatment they received in Part 2: Prophylactic cohort, 
n=56; On-demand cohort, n=14 
Outcomes and estimation 
Annualized bleeding rate, ABR: 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 55/103 
 
 
 
The mean ABR in the prophylactic cohort (n=56) was 4.26 (± 5.80) (median: 1.99; range: 0-23.4). This 
was considerably lower than the mean and median historical on-demand bleed rates given by 53 of these 
subjects, which were 16.92 (± 16.72) and 13, respectively (range: 0-70). In 22/56 subjects who had no 
bleeds  during  the  study,  the  subjects´  own  historical  on-demand  bleed  rate  was  14.32  (±  14.96) 
(median: 10, range: 2-50) compared with a rate of 18.77 (± 17.87) (median: 15, range: 0-70) for 31/56 
subjects with bleeds. The mean rate of joint bleeds in the prophylactic cohort (n=56) in this study was 
2.85 (± 4.25) compared with 1.41 (± 2.87) non-joint bleeds. The rate of spontaneous bleeds (mean: 1.72 
± 3.26; median: 0.00; range: 0.0-15.6) was comparable to the rate of bleeds caused by injury (mean: 
1.70 ± 2.80; median: 0.00; range: 0.0-10.7). 
Among the 14 subjects in the on-demand cohort of the FAS, who all had bleeds, the mean ABR was 33.87 
(± 17.37) and the median ABR 26.98 (range: 12.9-73.1). This was slightly higher than the mean and 
median of these subjects´ own historical on-demand bleed rates, which were 24.50 (± 13.65) and 17, 
respectively, with a range of 12- 56. The mean rate of joint bleeds in the on-demand cohort was 29.88 (± 
16.05) in the study versus 3.99 (± 5.26) for non-joint bleeds. The rate of spontaneous bleeds was higher 
(mean: 19.85 ± 12.90) than the rate of bleeds caused by injury (mean: 10.58 ± 13.58). 
Dose: 
The median dose per prophylactic infusion was 50.49 IU/kg in all 59 subjects on prophylaxis, and was 
50.475 IU/kg in the prophylactic cohort with at least 3 months of prophylactic treatment (n=56). 
The median number of prophylactic infusions per week was 1.8 (range: 1.5- 1.92) in all 59 subjects on 
prophylaxis  and  1.805  (range:  1.5-1.92)  in  the  prophylactic  cohort  with  a  minimum  of  3  months  of 
prophylactic treatment (n=56). Fifty-six (76.7%) subjects had 50 or more EDs to BAX326 during the 
study. In the prophylactic cohort (n=56), the mean number of EDs was 56.3 (± 7.2) (median: 54). 
Treatment of bleeding episodes: 
Of a total of 249 BEs in the FAS, 115 BEs occurred during prophylactic treatment and 134 BEs occurred in 
the on-demand cohort. By bleeding site, 197 were joint bleeds (of which 107 were bleeds into a target 
joint and 90 non-target joint BEs) and 52 were non-joint bleeds. While 130 bleeds were spontaneous 
bleeds, 90 were caused by injury; 29 were of unknown cause. 
Of the total of 249 BEs, the majority (153; 61.4%) were treated with one infusion. Fifty-eight (23.3%) 
BEs were treated with 2 infusions, and 38 (15.3%) BEs were treated with more than 3 infusions. Minor 
and moderate bleeds were mostly treated with one infusion only (78.9% and 56.4%, respectively). Seven 
of 15 major bleeds (46.7%) were treated with more than 3 infusions.  
Haemostatic  efficacy  at  resolution  of  bleed  was  rated  ‘excellent’  in  41.0%  and  ‘good’  in  55.0%  of  all 
treated BEs (total of 96.0%). Two percent of bleed treatments were rated as ‘fair’, and none had a rating 
of ‘none’. For the remaining 2.0%, no efficacy ratings were provided. 
The mean total dose per bleed was 83.83 ± 58.82 IU/kg (median: 62.29 IU/kg, range: 25.5-372.1 IU/kg. 
The highest mean dose (94.5 ± 64.3 IU/kg) was administered for non-joint bleeds. A mean dose of 81.0 
(±  57.1)  IU/kg  (median:  56.5  IU/kg)  was  administered  for  joint  bleeds.  A  higher  mean  dose  was 
administered for bleeds caused by injury (91.2 ± 62.5 IU/kg; range: 25-350 IU/kg) than for spontaneous 
bleeds (75.9 ± 50.3 IU/kg; range: 26-243 IU/kg). Three bleeds in 3 subjects (260004, 520001, 560001) 
were treated with more than 300 IU/kg. 
Consumption: 
All 73 subjects included in the FAS, consumed a total of 12,413,790 IU or – in terms of weight-adjusted 
consumption  –  177,980  IU/kg.  In  the  group  consisting  of  Part  1-3  subjects  and  subjects  from  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 56/103 
 
 
 
prophylactic cohort in Part 2 (n=59), the total consumption was 11,609,436 IU or 166,208 IU/kg. In the 
on-demand cohort of Part 2 (n=14), the total consumption was 804,354 IU or 11,772 IU/kg. 
Median consumption per month was 347.8 IU/kg (mean: 356.1 ±61.3 IU/kg) in the Part 1-3 subjects and 
prophylactic cohort (n=59) and 167.3 IU/kg (mean: 166.6 ±64.2 IU/kg) in the on-demand cohort of Part 
2 (n=14). By contrast, all 73 subjects in the FAS had a median consumption of 333.6 IU/kg per month 
(mean: 319.7 ± 97.0 IU/kg). 
The median number of infusions administered per month in the Part 1-3 subjects and prophylactic cohort 
(n=59) was 6.7 (mean: 6.9 ± 1.0) while it was only 2.7 (mean: 3.1 ± 1.2) in the on-demand cohort 
(n=14). 
Ancillary analyses 
ABR by Target Joint 
Of  56  subjects  in  the  prophylactic  cohort  with  a  minimum  of  3  months  of  prophylactic  treatment,  35 
reported  target  joints  at  screening.  The  overall  mean  ABR  was  higher  in  the  group  with  target  joints 
(mean: 5.25 ± 6.40, median: 3.10, range: 0.0-23.4) than in the 21 subjects with no target joints (mean: 
2.61 ± 4.27, median: 0.00, range: 0.0-16.6). The mean ABRs of joint bleeds in subjects with target joints 
(n=35)  compared  to  those  with  no  target  joints  (n=21)  were  3.81  ±  4.87  (median:  2.05,  range: 
0.0-21.5) and 1.25 ± 2.26 (median: 0.00, range: 0.0-7.7), respectively. The mean ABRs of non-joint 
bleeds were 1.44 ± 2.82 (median: 0.00, range: 0.0-10.7) and 1.36 ± 3.01 (median: 0.00, range: 0.0- 
10.4),  respectively.  Spontaneous  BEs  occurred  at  a  mean  rate  of  2.41  ±  3.01  (median:  0.00,  range: 
0.0-15.6) in subjects with target joints compared with 0.58 ± 1.63 (median: 0.00, range: 0.0-6.4) in 
subjects with no target joints. The rate of BEs caused by injury was also slightly higher (mean: 2.07 ± 
3.18, median: 0.00, range: 0.0-10.7) in the subjects with target joints (n=35) than in the 21 subjects 
with no target joints (mean: 1.07 ± 1.94, median: 0.00, range: 0.0-6.6). 
Quality of Life 
Subjects on prophylaxis reported statistically significant improvements between baseline and follow-up at 
approximately 6 months in the Physical Component Score (p = 0.0189) and the Bodily Pain (p = 0.0146) 
and Role Physical (p = 0.0162) domains of the SF-36 in addition to the EQ-5D VAS Score (p = 0.005). All 
other measures of HR QoL did not show significant changes over the course of the study in the subjects 
on prophylaxis. No significant differences in HR QoL were reported by the on-demand patients between 
baseline and follow-up.

Design 
Hypothesis 
Treatment groups 
This 3-part study was a Phase 1/3, prospective, multicenter study in PTPs 
with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B: 
• Part 1 was a randomized, blinded, controlled, crossover study to compare 
the PK parameters of BAX326 with BeneFIX in 27 subjects (26 evaluable) 
and to determine PK equivalence. Thrombotic markers were also assessed at 
specified time points. 
• Part 2 was an open-label, uncontrolled study of the haemostatic efficacy, 
safety, immunogenicity and HR QoL of BAX326 over 6 months with twice  
weekly prophylactic infusions with BAX326 or at least 50 exposure days  
(EDs) to BAX326, whichever occurred last, in 60 subjects in order to have 54 
evaluable subjects (prophylactic cohort) 
• An additional cohort of 15-20 subjects were to receive on demand 
treatment with BAX326 until the last subject of the prophylactic cohort 
completed the study (on-demand cohort) 
• Part 3 was an open-label, uncontrolled repeat PK study with BAX326 in the 
subjects who participated in Part 1 and had been treated for 26 ± 1 weeks in 
Part 2 having accumulated at least 30 EDs to BAX326. Thrombotic markers 
were also assessed at specified time points.

immunomodulating drug (e.g. corticosteroid agents at a dose equivalent to hydrocortisone greater 
than 10 mg/day, or α-interferon) other than antiretroviral chemotherapy 
Treatments 
The Rixubis dose for prophylactic treatment in paediatric patients in 251101 was 50 IU/kg twice weekly, 
ranging from 40 to 80 IU/kg, for a period of 6 months or for at least 50 EDs to BAX326, whichever 
occurred last The following guidance was to be employed, whenever possible, for determining the dose for 
treatment of bleeding episodes. The FIX level was not to fall below the given plasma activity level in the 
corresponding period. 
The required units were to be calculated according to the following formula:  
body weight (kg) x desired FIX rise (%) (IU/dL) x (reciprocal of observed recovery) 
Based on an anticipated recovery of 0.7 [IU/dl]/[IU/kg], the required units were to be calculated using the 
following formula: body weight (kg) x desired FIX rise (% or (IU/dL) x 1.4 IU/kg. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the paediatric study was to evaluate all AEs possibly or probably related to 
BAX326. The secondary objectives were the following: 
-  To evaluate the PK parameters of BAX326 in paediatric PTPs <12 years of age 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 61/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  To monitor incremental recovery (IR) of BAX326 over time 
-  To evaluate the haemostatic efficacy of BAX326 in the management and prevention of acute 
bleeding episodes for a period of 6 months 
-  To evaluate safety in terms of immunogenicity for a minimum of 50 exposure days (EDs), the 
occurrence of thrombotic events, as well as clinically significant changes in routine laboratory 
parameters (hematology/clinical chemistry) and vital signs 
-  To evaluate changes in HR QoL and health resource use. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints included the following PK endpoints: Total AUC/dose , MRT, CL, IR, T1/2, Vss, IR 
over time as discussed in the Pharmacokinetics section and the following haemostatic efficacy 
endpoints: 
Treatment of bleeding episodes: (Number of infusions per bleeding episode/ Overall haemostatic 
efficacy rating at resolution of bleed  
Prophylaxis: annualized bleeding rate / Prophylaxis: number of bleeding episodes beginning within 24 
and 48 hours of an infusion as exploratory outcome measures 
Consumption of BAX326: number of infusions and weight-adjusted consumption per month and per 
year; weight-adjusted consumption per event 
The following HR QoL parameters and health resource use were also assessed and changes in these 
parameters were part of the secondary study endpoints (see details above): 
• 
For subjects between 2 to 7 years of age: 
-  Generic: PedsQL™ (Parent-proxy versions: age group 2-4 years and age group 5-7 years) 
-  Health resource use (hospitalizations, emergency room visits, doctor office visits, etc.) 
• 
For subjects between 8 to 11 years of age: 
-  Disease-specific: Haemo-QoL, short version  
-  Generic: PedsQL™ Child version 
-  Health resource use (hospitalizations, emergency room visits, doctor office visits, etc.) 
Sample size 
Ten  subjects  aged  6  to  <  12  years  and  10  subjects  aged  <  6  years  were  required.  To  account  for  a 
potential drop out, a total of 24 subjects consisting of 12 subjects per age cohort were to be enrolled. 
Randomisation 
The study was not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised all subjects who received at least 1 infusion during the study. The 
Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Set (PKFAS) comprised all subjects who have at least 1 plasma FIX activity 
level available during post-infusion time points. A non-linear mixed effects model approach (population 
PK) was implemented to analyze PK data. Individual empirical Bayesian estimates of PK parameters from 
the population PK model were reported using descriptive statistics. IR during the prophylactic treatment 
phase was displayed graphically over time for each subject and was also summarized by visit.  
For all outcome measures descriptive statistics were presented by age stratum. Point estimates (mean or 
median) and 95% CIs were computed.  
The  annualized  rate  of  bleeding  episodes  during  prophylaxis  was  calculated  for  subjects  who  had 
adequate  treatment  time  for  bleeding  rate  assessment.  The  number  of  bleeding  episodes  beginning 
within 24 and 48 hours of the prophylactic infusion were summarized as exploratory outcome measures. 
The efficacy of BAX326 in the treatment of bleeds was summarized including overall haemostatic efficacy 
rating at resolution of bleed, and number of infusions and total weight-adjusted dose per bleeding episode. 
Product  consumption  was  summarized,  including  average  number  of  infusions  and  average 
weight-adjusted consumption per month / year, and average weight-adjusted consumption per event 
(prophylactic infusion and treatment of bleeds). 
Frequency counts and percentages were calculated for the following variables: occurrence of inhibitory 
and total binding antibodies to FIX, occurrence of antibodies to CHO proteins and rFurin, occurrence of 
severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) and occurrence of thrombotic events. 
For  the  Peds-QL,  the  total  score  and  two  summary  scores  (psychosocial  health  and  physical  health 
summary) were calculated for each subject, along with the scores for each of the Ped-QL domains. For the 
Haemo-QoL, a total score was calculated for each subject. For all scores, paired t-tests were employed to 
evaluate mean change from baseline at the Week 26 ± 1 follow-up. The analysis of health resource use 
data was descriptive in nature. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 23 patients were enrolled in the study (see figure X). Of these, 11 were <6 years and 12 were 
6  -  <12  years  old.  All  23  subjects  were  treated  with  IP  and  completed  the  PK  assessment  and  were 
therefore included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and the Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Set (PKFAS). 
Twenty-two  (22)  subjects  completed  the  protocol;  one  subject,  who  was  7  years  old  at  the  time  of 
consent, discontinued the study (withdrawal by subject) after 35 EDs to BAX326 and a study duration of 
4.34 months. Although the subject did not have ≥50 EDs to BAX326, he did complete >3 months (ie, 3.32 
months) of prophylactic treatment.

Recruitment 
Paediatric patients from 251101 study were enrolled at 11 study sites (3 sites in Russia with a total of 7 
subjects, 3 sites in Poland with a total of 5 subjects; 2 sites in Romania with a total of 5 subjects, 1 site 
in Ukraine with 3 subjects, 1 site in the UK with 2 subjects and 1 site in India with 1 subject).  
Conduct of the study 
The paediatric study was conducted between December 2011 and May 2013 No protocol amendments 
were performed during this study. A total of 81 deviations were reported in 20 subjects during the study 
divided  into  74  minor  deviations  related  to  the  protocol  schedule  and  seven  major  deviations  (in  7 
subjects) which mostly concerned BAX 326 administration.

All 23 enrolled subjects are included in the PKFAS and FAS and all 23 subjects completed ≥3 months of 
prophylactic treatment, therefore data for these populations are identical.  
The mean  subject age at the time of consent was 6.94 (± 3.394) years (median: 7.10 years, range:

1.8-11.8 years) (n=23). All subjects were male and all were white, except for one who was in the <6-year 
age cohort. The majority of subjects (17; 73.9%) had severe haemophilia B (FIX level <1%); 6 (26.1%) 
subjects  had  moderately  severe  haemophilia  B  (FIX  level  1-2%).  FIX  antigen  levels  were  <1%  in  8 
(34.8%) subjects and ≥1% in 15 (65.2%) subjects, with levels ≥40% in 8 (34.8%) subjects. Of the 18 
subjects with available results of FIX gene mutation analysis, the majority (11 subjects; 47.8%) had a 
missense mutation. Two subjects (8.7%) had a nonsense mutation, another two subjects (8.7%) had a 
deletion, and one subject each had a splice-site (4.3%), a frameshift (4.3%) and a promoter mutation 
(4.3%).  
Prior to treatment in the study, most subjects (16; 69.6%) had received prophylactic treatment, 1 subject 
had  received  on-demand  treatment  and  6  (26.1%)  subjects  had  received  both  prophylactic  and 
on-demand treatment.  
The mean ABR prior to enrolment was 6.8 (± 9.26) (median: 2.0, range: 0.0-29). Only 4 subjects had 
arthropathy  at  screening;  all  of  them  were  in  the  6-to-<12-year  age  cohort  and  had  received  either 
prophylaxis only or prophylactic and on-demand treatment as prior treatment. Target joints were also 
only present in the 6-to-<12-year age cohort: 2 subjects had 1-2 target joints, 2 subjects had 3-4 target 
joints and 1 subject had >4 (ie, 5) target joints. 
An overview of the medical history by system organ class (SOC) was presented. All 23 (100%) subjects 
had a history in the hematopoietic/lymphatic SOC due to the disease under investigation in this study. A 
high number of subjects had a medical history in the gastrointestinal SOC (18 subjects [78.3%], 9 in each 
age cohort). However, in 14 subjects this was solely due to vaccinations against hepatitis A and/or B. One 
subject was positive for both hepatitis B core and surface antibodies (mild severity) and another subject 
was positive for hepatitis B surface antibody (mild). A medical history in the musculoskeletal SOC was 
only documented for 5 (21.7%) subjects. 
Four subjects who were all in the 6-to-<12-year age cohort, had a history of arthropathy; one subject, in 
the younger age cohort, had a history of hematomas of the occipital area and of the lower limbs in the 
musculoskeletal SOC. In 3 of 5 subjects with a history in the cardiovascular SOC this was due to the 
implantation  of  central  venous  catheters;  additionally  a  case  of  vaccination  against  hepatitis  B  was 
recorded under the cardiovascular SOC and a case of a systolic murmur.  
Treatment compliance 
For PK assessment, 22 of 23 subjects in the PKFAS received the dose as prescribed (75 ± 5 IU/kg). One 
subject received a slightly higher dose (83.60 IU/kg), which was recorded as a major protocol deviation, 
however, the subject´s values were not excluded from the analysis.  
For the prophylactic regimen (recommended dose of 50 IU/kg BAX326 twice weekly ranging from 40-80 
IU/kg), the mean compliance in dose was 97.45 (± 8.848)% (median: 100%; range: 62.0-100%), and 
mean compliance in treatment frequency was 90.83(± 7.216)% (median: 92.45%; range: 74.5-100%). 
Compliance in dose and frequency was comparable between the two age cohorts. 
Numbers analysed 
The FAS comprised all 23 subjects who were exposed to IP. Within the FAS, subjects were analyzed by 
age cohort: <6 years (n=11) and 6 to <12 years (n=12). The Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Set (PKFAS) 
included 23 subjects. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Overall annualized bleeding rate:  
Assessment report

The mean ABR for all 23 subjects with ≥3 months of prophylactic treatment was 2.7 (± 3.14) (median: 
2.0; range: 0.0-10.8). The mean ABR was slightly higher in subjects 6 to <12 years of age (n=12) than 
in subjects <6 years of age (n=11): mean ABR of 3.4 (± 3.93) (range: 0.0-10.8) in the older age cohort 
compared with 1.9 (± 1.89) (range: 0.0-5.4) in the younger age cohort. However, the median ABRs were 
comparable: median ABR of 2.0 in subjects <6 years of age compared with median ABR of 1.8 in subjects 
6 to <12 years of age. 
ABR by bleeding cause 
The cause of BEs was mostly due to injury. In subjects of all ages, the mean ABR of BEs caused by injury 
was 2.4 (± 2.92) (median: 1.9; range: 0.0-10.8) compared with a mean ABR of spontaneous BEs of 0.2 
(±0.66) (median: 0; range: 0.0-2.0). The ABR by cause (ie, spontaneous or injury) was evenly distributed 
among subjects of both age cohorts.  
ABRs by Bleeding Site  
In subjects of all ages (n=23), the mean ABR of joint Bes (major joints: wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, knee, 
ankle) was 0.8 (± 1.76) (median: 0; range: 0.0-7.2). Given the presence of arthropathic joints and target 
joints in 4 and 5 subjects, respectively, in the 6-to-<12-year cohort, the mean ABR of joint BEs was 
higher in the older than in the younger age cohort where no arthropathy nor target joints were recorded 
at screening (see below Table 10). Of note, the ABR on non-joint BEs (soft tissue, muscle, body cavity, 
intracranial and other) was higher than the ABR of joint BEs. Indeed, in subjects of all ages, the mean ABR 
of non-joint BEs was 1.9 (± 2.42) (median: 1.9; range: 0.0-8.2) compared with a mean ABR of 0.8 (± 
1.76) (median: 0; range: 0.0-7.2) for joint Bes.  
ABRs by Bleeding Site, Cause and Baseline Characteristics 
In the 12 subjects in the 6-to-<12-year age cohort, the ABR of joint BEs was higher in the 8 subjects who 
did not have arthropathy at screening (mean ABR: 1.9 [± 2.63]; median: 0.8; range: 0.0-7.2) than in the 
4  subjects  who  had  arthropathy  at  screening  (0.5 [± 1.0];  median:  0;  range:  0.0-2.0).  None  of  the  4 
subjects with arthropathy had non-joint BEs and none had spontaneous BEs. Similarly, the ABR of joint 
BEs was higher in the 7 subjects who did not have target joints at screening (mean ABR: 2.2 [± 2.71]; 
median:  2.0;  range:  0.0-7.2)  than  in  the  5 subjects  who  had  target  joints  (mean  ABR:  0.3  [±  0.7]; 
median: 0; range: 0.0-1.6). None of the 5 subjects with target joints at screening had non-joint BEs and 
none had spontaneous BEs. (see table below)

Ancillary analyses 
ABRs of joint and non-joint BEs, of spontaneous BEs and BEs caused by injury were also analyzed by 
baseline characteristics, such as arthropathy at screening, target joints at screening and baseline FIX at 
screening. Only subjects in the older age cohort had arthropathy (n=4) and/or target joints (n=5) at 
screening. None of the subjects <6 years of age had arthropathy or target joints at screening.  
Of 23 subjects in the FAS, 17 had a baseline FIX activity level <1% at screening (9 subjects <6 years and 
8 subjects 6 to <12 years of age) and 6 had a baseline FIX activity level 1-2% (2 subjects <6 years and 
4 subjects 6 to <12 years of age).  
In subjects with a baseline FIX activity level <1% (n=17), the mean ABR of joint BEs was 0.6 (± 1.79) 
(median: 0, range: 0.0-7.2) compared with a mean rate of 2.2 (± 2.70) (median: 1.9, range: 0.0-8.2) for 
non-joint BEs. In subjects with a baseline FIX activity level 1-2% (n=6), the mean ABR of joint BEs was 
1.4 (± 1.70) (median: 1.0; range: 0.0-4.2) compared with a mean rate of 1.0 (± 1.11) (median: 1.0; 
range: 0.0-2.1) for non-joint BEs. Two subjects <6 years of age with a baseline FIX activity level 1-2% 
had no joint BEs.

Study 251002 
 This was a phase 3, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of Rixubis in approximately 30 subjects with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B 
undergoing elective or emergency surgical, dental or other invasive procedures. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were as in study 250901 with the following additional criteria: 
Inclusion criteria: 
•  Subject is participating in either the BAX326 Pivotal Study (250901), the BAX326 Continuation 
Study (251001) or the BAX326 Paediatric Study (251101) requiring an emergency or elective 
major or minor surgical, dental, or other invasive procedure, and continues to meet eligibility 
criteria as outlined in the BAX326 pivotal, continuation, or pediatric study. 
• 
For newly entering subjects, ie, subjects not participating in any other BAX326 clinical study, the 
following main inclusion criteria applied: 
•  Subject requires elective major surgery 
Exclusion criteria: 
•  History of FIX inhibitors with a titer ≥ 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) (as determined by the Nijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay or the assay employed in the respective local laboratory) at any 
time prior to screening 
•  Detectable FIX inhibitor at screening, with a titer ≥0.6 BU as determined by the Nijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay in the central laboratory 
•  Subject requires emergency surgery vi 
Treatments 
For major surgeries FIX levels should not fall below 80-100% of normal until wound healing is achieved. 
If the duration of the surgery is more than 4 hours, an additional bolus to increase the FIX level by 40% 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 71/103 
 
 
  
 
 
 
may be administered after 4 hours. Depending on the subject’s individual pharmacokinetics, FIX infusions 
needed to be repeated every 8 to 24 hours. Once adequate wound healing is achieved, FIX trough levels 
are to be maintained in a range of 30-60% of normal for 7 to 14 days, depending on the type and location 
of intervention. For orthopaedic surgery, trough levels of 20-40% for weeks 3-4 are still desirable. The 
World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) recommends initial trough levels of 60-80% which should be 
maintained for at least 72 hours, and levels of 40-60% for days 4-6. 
For minor surgeries FIX levels should not fall below 30-60% of normal for at least a day, depending on the 
nature and location of the intervention. Infusions are generally to be repeated every 24 hours, until 
healing is achieved. 
The dosing guidance on how to maintain pre-infusion target plasma FIX levels and dosing frequency 
during the postoperative period is described below. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the haemostatic efficacy and safety of BAX326 in the peri- and 
postoperative setting in subjects with severe (FIX level < 1%) or moderately severe (FIX level 1-2%) 
haemophilia  B  undergoing  major  or  minor  elective  or  emergency  surgical,  dental  or  other  invasive 
procedures. 
The secondary objectives were:  To determine the actual intra- and postoperative blood loss at the end of 
surgery and until drain removal, if applicable, compared to the estimated volume of the expected average 
and maximum blood loss as predicted preoperatively by the operating surgeon; To determine the intra- 
and  postoperative  haemostatic  efficacy  at  the  end  of  the  surgery,  at  the  time  of  drain  removal,  if 
applicable, or at postoperative day 3 (approx. 72 h postoperatively) in case of major surgery and no drain 
employed, and at the time of discharge from the hospital on a scale of “excellent”, “good”, “fair” and 
“none”; To  calculate  the  daily  and  total  weight-adjusted  dose  of  BAX326  per  subject;   To  record  the 
number of units and amount of blood product transfused; To record the development of inhibitory and 
total binding antibodies to FIX; To determine AEs related to BAX326; To determine the occurrence of 
thrombotic events. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The intraoperative haemostatic efficacy was to be assessed by the operating surgeon according to the 
criteria shown below. The rating was to reflect the intraoperative blood loss as compared to the expected 
amount of blood loss estimated preoperatively for the type of procedure in a haemostatically normal 
individual.

Intraoperative efficacy assessment  
Excellent 
Intra-operative blood loss was less than or equal to that expected for the type of 
surgical procedure performed (<100%) 
Good 
Intra-operative blood loss was up to 50% more than expected for the type of 
surgical procedure performed (101 -150%) 
Fair 
Intra-operative blood loss was more than 50% of that expected for the type of 
surgical procedure performed (>150%) 
None 
Uncontrolled  haemorrhage  that  was  the  result  of  inadequate  therapeutic 
response despite proper dosing, necessitating a change of FIX concentrate. 
- 
The postoperative haemostatic efficacy was also to be assessed by the operating surgeon, at the time of 
drain removal. The ratings were to reflect the volume in drain as compared to the volume estimated 
preoperatively for the type of procedure performed in a haemostatically normal individual. The rating 
criteria were as follows:

procedure performed (>150%) 
None 
Uncontrolled  bleeding  that  was  the  result  of  inadequate  therapeutic  response 
despite proper dosing, necessitating a change of FIX concentrate. 
In the case of major surgery and where no drain was employed, the postoperative haemostatic efficacy 
was to be assessed by the operating surgeon on postoperative day 3 (approximately 72 h 
postoperatively).

concentrate. 
- 
On the day of discharge from hospital, the haemostatic efficacy was to be assessed by the investigator, 
i.e., haemophilia physician. The rating criteria were the same as for postoperative day 3 (see above). 
Consumption of BAX326 during and after surgery 
During the intraoperative period, the mean weight-adjusted dose in the PPAS was 188 IU/kg (range: 
134-296  IU/kg)  for  major  surgery  (n=10),  200  IU/kg  (range:  147-296  IU/kg)  for  orthopedic  surgery 
(n=6) and 132 IU/kg (range: 55-203 IU/kg for minor surgery (n=3).  
During the postoperative period, the mean weight-adjusted dose in the PPAS was 1,264 IU/kg (range: 
415-2,965  IU/kg)  for  major  surgery  (n=10),  1,487  IU/kg  (range:  829-2,965  IU/kg)  for  orthopedic 
surgery (n=6) and 291 IU/kg (range: 55-601 IU/kg) for minor surgery (n=3). 
Blood Product use 
Three subjects in the  PPAS and 4 subjects in the FAS,  who all underwent major (orthopedic surgery) 
received blood product transfusions, either in the form of packed red blood cells or fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP). The mean volume transfused was 558.7 mL in the PPAS (range: 520-600 mL). In the FAS, the 
mean volume transfused was 725.3 mL during the intraoperative period (range: 520-1225 mL) and 575 
mL during the postoperative period. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  not  based  on  statistical  considerations  and  was  determined  by  the  number  of 
subjects  participating  in  BAX326  Pivotal  (250901),  BAX326  Continuation  (251001)  and  BAX326 
Paediatric (251101) studies, who were undergoing major or minor elective or emergency surgical, dental 
or other invasive procedures. It was planned that approximately 30 elective or emergency surgical, dental 
or  other  invasive  procedures  would  be  performed  in  approximately  30  subjects.  At  least  10  of  the 
procedures had to be major surgeries in 10 unique subjects. Additional subjects not participating in any 
of these studies could also be enrolled.

Randomisation 
The study was not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised all subjects exposed to IP and who provide data suitable for the 
haemostatic efficacy analysis. The analysis in paediatric subjects < 12 years of age was to be performed 
separately,  if  applicable.  The  intra-  and  post-operative  haemostatic  efficacy  assessment  was  to  be 
summarized for the FAS by percentage of subjects in each efficacy categories (‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘fair’ 
and ‘none’) at each time point. Actual intra- and postoperative blood loss, if applicable, and the difference 
from the expected average and maximum blood loss were to be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including median and range. The summary of average daily and total weight-adjusted dose of BAX326 per 
subject  was  to  be  provided  using  median  and  range.  Units  and  amount  (in  mL)  of  blood  product 
transfused was also to be presented descriptively. 
A frequency count and the proportion of subjects with incidence of inhibitory and total binding antibodies 
to FIX were to be presented for the SAS. The occurrence of IP-related AEs and thrombotic events were to 
be evaluated descriptively. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Fourteen subjects have completed the protocol following treatment with BAX326 for surgery. All 14 
subjects are included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). Thirteen of 14 subjects had previously been treated 
in BAX326 Pivotal Study 250901.  
Most protocol deviations were minor. Major deviations were reported for 7 subjects. The majority of these 
were of the category ‘procedure not done’ (eg, local lab result missing). The most serious deviation, which 
was a local breach of GCP and the protocol, was committed by an investigator who performed major 
surgery (total hip replacement) despite knowing that the FIX results from the local laboratory were 
unreliable and who based postoperative IP dosing and FIX monitoring on aPTT only. For this reason, the 
patient was not included in the PPAS.

Recruitment 
The 14 subjects included in the surgery study came from 5 study sites in 4 countries (Russia: 6 subjects 
from 2 sites, Bulgaria: 3 subjects, Poland: 3 subjects, Ukraine: 2 subjects). Thirteen of 14 subjects had 
previously  been  treated  in  BAX326  Pivotal  Study  250901.  Of  those  13  subjects,  12  also  received 
treatment in the BAX326 Continuation Study 251001. 
Conduct of the study 
The surgery study was initiated in December 2011 There have been 2 amendments to the study protocol, 
a global one mainly changing the design so that subjects taking part in the paediatric study (251101) 
could also be recruited into the surgery study and adding occurrence of thrombotic events as a safety 
endpoint and a local amendment specific to the UK.

Table 20: Demographic and Baseline Characteristics - Continuous Data (Study 251002) 
Eleven subjects had severe haemophilia B, with a FIX level <1%, and 3 subjects had moderately severe 
haemophilia B, with a FIX level 1-2%. FIX antigen levels were <1% in 6 (42.9%) subjects and ≥1% in 8 
(57.1%)  subjects,  with  levels  ≥40%  in  5  (35.7%)  subjects.  Gene  mutations  were  diagnosed  in  10 
subjects; 7 had a missense, 2 a nonsense and 1 a frameshift mutation. All 14 subjects had arthropathy at 
screening (see below Table 21).

Table 21: Demographic and Baseline Characteristics - Categorical Data –Study 251002 
Regarding the medical history classified by the system organ class (SOC), all 14 subjects had a history in 
the hematopoietic/lymphatic and musculoskeletal categories, due to the disease under investigation in 
this study (haemophilia B) and a diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy. All 14 subjects also had a history 
of hepatitis A, B and/or C. 
Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) for the interim analysis comprises 14 subjects who underwent 14 surgeries 
of which 11 were major and 3 were minor surgeries. The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) comprises 13 
surgeries of which 10 were major surgeries. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Of a total of 14 surgeries performed, 11 were major surgeries (of which 7 were orthopedic), and 3 were 
minor. Ten major surgeries (of which 6 were orthopedic) and 3 minor surgeries are included in the PPAS 
(n=13). Eleven major surgeries (of which 7 were orthopedic) and 3 minor surgeries are included in the 
FAS (n=14). 
Intraoperative Blood Loss 
In the PPAS (n=13), the mean intraoperative blood loss was 201.2 mL (range: 0-1100 mL). As expected, 
blood loss was higher in major (n=10) than in minor (n=3) surgeries (mean of 261.0 vs. 1.7 mL) and was 
highest  in  orthopedic  (n=6)  surgeries  (420.0  mL,  range:  20-1100).  In  terms  of  actual  vs.  predicted 
average/maximum intraoperative blood loss, actual blood loss during major surgery largely matched the 
predicted blood loss: 6/11 major surgeries matched the average predicted blood loss, 2/11 matched the 
maximum predicted blood loss, 2/11 were below the average predicted blood loss, and 1/11 (not included 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 78/103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the PPAS due to major protocol deviation) was between the average predicted and maximum predicted 
blood loss. For all 3 minor surgeries, actual intraoperative blood loss was below the average predicted 
blood loss. 
Postoperative Blood Loss 
A total of 7 subjects, who all had major surgery (6 orthopedic, 1 non-orthopedic), had a drain placed. In 
the 6 subjects in the PPAS who had a drain placed, the mean postoperative blood loss was 703.5 mL 
(range:  11-1100  mL).  Blood  loss  was  slightly  higher  in  orthopedic  surgeries  (n=5;  mean:  842.0  mL, 
range:  500-1100  mL).  In  terms  of  actual  vs.  predicted  average/maximum  postoperative  blood  loss, 
actual  blood  loss  was  mostly  higher  than  or  equal  to  the  maximum  predicted  blood  loss:  4/7  major 
surgeries with drain placement were above the maximum predicted blood loss (including one surgery that 
is not part of the PPAS), 2/7 met the maximum predicted blood loss, and 1/7 was between the average 
predicted  and  maximum  predicted  blood  loss.  When  analyzing  the  4  major  surgeries  with  an  actual 
postoperative blood loss exceeding the maximum predicted blood loss, FIX levels on postoperative days 
1-3 ranged between 34.3-40% for patient with a joint replacement and between 40-56% for a patient 
with a total hip replacement. The latter was excluded from the PPAS since the principal investigator (PI) 
dosed the patient according to aPTT values. In both patients, the drain was removed on postoperative day 
3.  For  patient  with  a  removal  of  residual  nail  from  intramedullary  nailing  of  left  femur  fracture,  the 
postoperative actual blood loss exceeded the maximum predicted blood loss by 10 mL (810 vs 800 mL). 
The subject´s pre-infusion FIX levels were within the recommended range (84.5-91%). However, the 
initially predicted blood loss did not take into account the use of a tourniquet, and it was only decided 
intra-operatively to place a drain which was removed on postoperative day 1. The PI was then asked to 
retrospectively  predict  blood  loss,  taking  into  account  the  use  of  a  tourniquet  and  the  drain.  Patient 
having a total knee replacement, had FIX levels ranging from 55.6-81.1%. The drain was removed on 
postoperative day 3; the postoperative actual blood loss exceeded the maximum predicted by 100 mL 
(1100 vs. 1000 mL). 
Haemostatic Efficacy Assessment 
All surgeries included in the intraoperative assessment (n=13 in the PPAS, n=14 in the FAS) had a rating 
of ‘excellent’. At drain removal, 50% of the ratings were ’excellent’and 50% were‘good’ (3/6 subjects in 
the PPAS and 3/7 subjects in the FAS had a rating of‘excellent’, and 3/6 subjects in the PPAS and 4/7 
subjects in the FAS had a rating of ’good’). On postoperative day 3, all 6 surgeries in the PPAS/FAS where 
no  drain  was  employed  (including  4  major  surgeries),  had  a  rating  of    `excellent’.  At  discharge  from 
hospital, most of the ratings were ‘excellent’ and the rest were ‘good’: 11/13 (84.6%) subjects in the 
PPAS and 11/14(78.6%) subjects in the FAS had a rating of ‘excellent’ and 2/13 subjects in the PPAS and 
3/14 subjects in the FAS had a rating of ’good’.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A combined analysis of studies 250901 and 251101 was performed in order to increase precision of 
efficacy estimates, both for annualized bleeding rates and for haemostatic efficacy (response 
‘excellent/good’ versus ‘fair/none’) in the treatment of bleeds. The Applicant has provided analyses using 
a negative binomial and a Poisson regression (annualized bleeding rates) and a logistic regression 
analysis considering the correlated data structure (haemostatic efficacy).

A pooled estimate (including a 95% CI) for the annualized bleeding rate of the prophylactic treatment 
arms of studies 250901 and 251101 (ignoring the on demand treatment arm from study 250901) was 
provided. 
The pooled estimates for the annualized bleeding rate of the prophylactic treatment arms of studies 
250901 and 251101 are presented in the table below. The estimated annualized bleeding rates of the 
prophylactic treatment (95% CI) from negative binomial and poisson regression model are 3.77 (2.87; 
4.95) and 3.72 (2.81; 4.91), respectively.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of Rixubis in prophylaxis and control of bleeding in previously treated patients 12 years and 
older has been evaluated in the open-label, uncontrolled part of a combined phase 1/3 study 250901 in 
which a total of 73 male, previously treated patients (PTPs) between 12 and 59 years of age received 
Rixubis either for prophylaxis and/or for the treatment of bleeding episodes on an on-demand basis. All 
subjects had severe (factor IX level <1%) or moderately severe (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B.  
The safety and efficacy in the perioperative setting was evaluated in an ongoing phase 3 prospective, 
open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study in male PTPs with severe and moderately severe haemophilia 
B using Rixubis (study 251002). The efficacy of Rixubis in prophylaxis and control of bleeding in PTPs 
below 12 years has been evaluated in a combined phase 2/3 study 251101. All subjects had severe 
(factor IX level <1%) or moderately severe (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. 
The design of submitted clinical trials investigating efficacy (250901, 251101 and 251002) of BAX326 
follows the requirements of the current guideline for recombinant FIX products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009).  
The included patient population was multi-national and comprised previously treated children (0-12 years 
of age), adolescents and adults suffering from severe to moderately severe haemophilia B defined as FIX 
levels ≤2%. A total of 99 patients with haemophilia B had been exposed to BAX326 in the clinical 
development programme. Fifty-nine PTPs received Rixubis for prophylaxis. Fifty-six of these PTPs who 
received Rixubis for a minimum of 3 months (with at least 50EDs) were included in the efficacy evaluation 
for prophylaxis. An additional 14 PTPs received on demand treatment of bleeding episodes only until the 
last subject of the prophylactic cohort completed the study. Subjects in the on-demand cohort had to 
have at least 12 documented bleeding episodes requiring treatment within 12 months prior to enrolment.   
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 83/103 
 
 
 
 
The mean treatment duration in the on-demand cohort was 3.5±1.00 months (median 3.4, ranging 
from 1.2 to 5.1 months), the mean total annualised bleeding rate (ABR) was 33.9±17.37 with a median 
of 27.0, ranging from 12.9 to 73.1. 
In the paediatric study, 23 male PTPs between 1.8 and 11.8 years (median age 7.10 years) 
with 11 patients < 6 years, received Rixubis for prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. 
All 23 subjects received prophylactic treatment with Rixubis for a minimum of 3 months  (with at least 
50EDs) and were included in the efficacy evaluation for prophylaxis. 
In the on-going surgery study, 14 patients received preventive treatment during 14 surgeries (11 major, 
3 minor).  
The chosen endpoints are considered adequate for assessing efficacy of a new FIX product. Moreover, the 
endpoints are in accordance with the relevant guideline.  
Treatment and dosage was in general in line with the “state of the art” recommendations as well as with 
the Core SmPC for FIX products. In trial 250901 (PTPs ≥12 years of age) the dose for prophylactic 
treatment was higher than recommended by the Guidelines for the Management of Haemophilia of the 
World Federation of Haemophilia or the Core SmPC for FIX products. However, the dose 
recommendations were comparable with those of another recombinant FIX product (BeneFix). Adults and 
adolescents could either receive a preventive dose regimen or an on-demand regimen in trial 250901. 
Children (0-12 years of age) could only receive preventive therapy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The annualized bleeding rate in the adult and adolescent population (≥12 years) was 4.26 in the 
prophylactic cohort. Appropriate statistical methodology has been applied to analyse results across the 2 
trials and results were consistent and favourable for both efficacy endpoints. In the paediatric population 
the mean annualized bleeding rate for all 23 subjects with ≥3 months of prophylactic treatment was 2.7. 
Among adult and adolescent patients in the on-demand cohort the mean annualized bleeding rate was 
33.87.  
Most of the bleeding episodes were stopped with one or two infusions, 88.5% and 84.7% in the paediatric 
and adult/adolescent population, respectively. Furthermore, haemostatic efficacy of BAX326 was rated as 
excellent or good in 96.2 % of all bleeding events in the paediatric population and in 96% of all bleeding 
episodes in the adult/adolescent population. Generally, the consumption data observed across studies are 
regarded to be acceptable and reflect the current state of FIX-replacement-therapy. 
The median ABR on prophylaxis with Rixubis for all bleeds was 2.0, for spontaneous bleeds 0.0, and for 
joint bleeds 0.0. 24 subjects (42.9%) experienced zero bleeds. 
A total of 249 bleeding episodes were treated with Rixubis, of which 197 were joint bleeds 
and 52 non-joint bleeds (soft tissue, muscle, body cavity, intracranial and other). Of a total 
of 249 bleeding episodes, 163 were moderate, 71 were minor, and 15 were major. Treatment was 
individualised based on the severity, cause and site of bleed. Of the 249 bleeding episodes, the majority 
(211; 84.7%) were treated with 1-2 infusions. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of bleed was rated 
excellent or good in 95.4% of all treated bleeding episodes. 
In paediatric patients, the median ABR was 2.0, for spontaneous bleeds 0.0 and for joint bleeds 0.0. Nine 
subjects (39.1%) experienced zero bleeds. A total of 26 bleeding episodes were treated with Rixubis, of 
which 23 bleeds were due to injury, 2 spontaneous and 1 of unknown origin. 19 bleeds were non-joint 
(soft tissue, muscle, body cavity, intracranial and other) and 7 were joint bleeds of which 1 was a bleed 
into a target joint. Of the 26 bleeding episodes, 15 were minor, 9 moderate, and 2 major. Treatment 
was individualised based on the severity, cause and site of bleed. The majority (23; 88,5%) were treated 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 84/103 
 
 
 
with 1-2 infusions. Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of a bleed was rated excellent or good in 96.2% of 
all treated bleeding episodes. 
It is understandable that due to the small overall patient population available for investigation in 
haemophilia B each of the individual trials was of small sample size. As a consequence uncertainty on 
efficacy estimates necessarily remained large. In general, performing analyses across trials is a means to 
increase precision of estimates. This is though it is acknowledged, that each trial population has its own 
characteristics (e.g. age). The Applicant was asked to provide such analyses combining studies 250901 
and 251101, both for annualized bleeding rates and for haemostatic efficacy (response ‘excellent/good’ 
versus ‘fair/none’) in the treatment of bleeds. In both cases, the requests regarding the additional 
statistical analyses on the individual studies were to be considered and point estimates as well as 95% 
confidence intervals were provided. Respective analyses have been performed and results showed 
favourable haemostatic efficacy as well as annualized bleeding rate. Submitted data are considered 
sufficient to demonstrate efficacy of BAX326 for prevention and treatment of bleeds in patients with 
Haemophilia B as well as efficacy during surgery. The guideline requirement to submit data of a minimum 
of 5 patients undergoing at least 10 surgical procedures (comprising major surgeries) is even exceeded 
with data of 14 patients undergoing surgical procedures of which 11 were major surgeries. Furthermore, 
the results are comparable with published data from other licensed FIX products (BeneFix, Haemonine). 
The per-protocol efficacy analysis includes 13 surgeries performed in 13 patients 
between 19 and 54 years of age undergoing major or minor surgical, dental or other surgical invasive 
procedures. Ten procedures were major including 6 orthopaedic and 1 dental surgery. Three procedures, 
including 2 dental extractions, were considered minor. Patients undergoing major surgeries had to 
perform a pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation. All patients were dosed based on their most recent individual 
incremental recovery. The recommended initial loading dose of Rixubis was to ensure that during surgery, 
factor IX activity levels of 80-100% for major surgeries and 30-60% for minor surgeries were maintained. 
Rixubis was administered by bolus infusions. 
Haemostasis was maintained throughout the study duration. 
The rating scale for measuring intra-, postoperative blood loss and haemostatic efficacy was very strictly 
predefined and therefore the efficacy results can be considered highly accurate.   
For 7 of 11 major surgeries, efficacy was rated as ‘excellent’, and for 4/11 major surgeries, as ‘good`. For 
7 major surgeries where drain was placed, postoperative haemostatic efficacy was rated at the time of 
drain removal as either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’.  All 4 major surgeries where no drain was placed had rating 
of ‘excellent’, and at the discharge from hospital, most of the ratings were ‘excellent’ and the rest were 
‘good’.  In  overall,  the  results  of  surgery  study  are  satisfactory  and  comparable  to  published  data  for 
BeneFIX. 
Subjects on prophylaxis reported statistically significant improvements between baseline and follow-up at 
approximately 6 months in the Physical Component Score (p = 0.0189) and the Bodily Pain (p = 0.0146) 
and Role Physical (p = 0.0162) domains of the SF-36 in addition to the EQ-5D VAS Score (p = 0.005). All 
other measures of HR QoL did not show significant changes over the course of the study in the subjects 
on prophylaxis. No significant differences in HR QoL were reported by the on-demand patients between 
baseline and follow-up. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rixubis in 
previously untreated patients in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in haemophilia B (see 
section 4.2 of SmPC for information on paediatric use). 
No Previously Untreated Patients (PUPs) were investigated through the clinical development plan. Despite 
the waiver granted by the PDCO for this population, collection of clinical data in PUP appears important 
and will be initiated via a registry (EUHASS, PedNet).Continuation study 251001 will further evaluate

haemostatic efficacy in 100 subjects who completed Study 250901 or Paediatric Study 251101 (see also 
RMP). Final report from the ongoing study 251002 is expected to be submitted by end 2014. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy has been analysed for prophylaxis, on-demand treatment, treatment of breakthrough BE, and 
prophylaxis for surgical procedures. Study designs, selection and number of patients, assessment tools 
and results are in general adequate for supporting efficacy of the FIX product. Data have been reflected 
in the SmPC. 
The available clinical data on nonacog gamma suggest that it is an efficacious new FIX product for the 
prevention and treatment of bleeds in previously treated patients suffering from Haemophilia B.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
In the clinical development programme, the safety of BAX326 is being assessed by monitoring the 
occurrence of AEs, by evaluating changes in clinical laboratory parameters and vital signs, and by 
assessing immunogenicity in terms of the development of FIX inhibitors, total binding FIX antibodies, and 
antibodies to CHO protein and rFurin. 
Patient exposure 
Data from 4 clinical trials contribute to the integrated analysis of safety: 
• 
The pivotal study 250901 and the paediatric study 251101, both of which were completed..  
•  Study 251002, the surgery study, which is ongoing and of which an interim study report was 
provided.   
•  Study 251001, the continuation study, which is currently ongoing and where no separate report 
is available.  
Overall, there are 99 unique subjects in the safety database: 73 subjects initially enrolled in Pivotal Study 
250901, 23 subjects from Paediatric Study 251101 and 3 subjects enrolled directly (without prior 
enrolment in the Pivotal Study or Paediatric Study) in Surgery Study 251002.

Adverse events 
Of the 337 AEs reported for subjects included in this integrated analysis, 327 (in 79 [79.8%] subjects) 
were non-serious.  
Summary of the number of AEs by age group: 
•  <6 years - All (31) AEs were non-serious and not related: 22 of these AEs were rated as mild, 7 
as moderate and 2 as severe. 
•  6 to <12 years – 38 AEs in 10 subjects: 
o  4 not related SAEs in 3 subjects 
o  34 non-serious, not related AEs in 9 subjects 
•  12 to <16 years – All (4) AEs were mild, non-serious and not related. 
•  ≥16 years- 264 AEs in 57 subjects: 
o  6 not related SAEs in 5 subjects 
o  258 non-serious in 57 subjects (252 AEs not related) 
The majority of the non-serious AEs appear to have been related to mild infections or gastrointestinal 
disease, abnormal immunology tests (antibodies of indeterminate specificity in assays for FIX or rFurin) 
or arthralgia, a well-described complication of haemophilia, and not related to Rixubis.

Non-serious AEs using the Preferred Term which occurred in at least 4 subjects were evaluated for any 
pattern and compared with reference data from the general population not taking any medication, if 
available: 
Anaemia: The Preferred Term included postoperative, haemorrhagic, hypochromic and normochromic 
anaemia. There were a total of 10 AEs of anaemia in 9/99 subjects recorded. The severity was moderate 
in 7 and mild in 3 cases. All AEs were considered not related by the investigator except one which is 
classified as not related by the sponsor. In one subject with a history of GI ulcer starting in 1999 two 
haemorrhagic anaemia occurred. Other cases of anaemia were the result of surgery or considered part of 
the underlying disease with repetitive bleeding episodes. A causal relationship to BAX326 can be ruled 
out. 
Cough was reported in 6/99 subjects. In two subjects it occurred twice. The severity was mild except in 
one case and all AEs were considered as not related by the investigator. Cough started between 1 – 4 days 
following the last infusion of BAX326. In 5/8 AEs of cough there was a temporal association with infection/ 
infestation; in the other 3 cases, cough started between 1.9 and 3 days following the infusion. A causal 
relationship with BAX326 is unlikely. 
Diarrhoea: This AE was reported 7 times in 4 subjects, in one subject occurring 4 times. They all were of 
mild severity and all were considered as not related by the investigator. In 3 subjects diarrhoea started 0 
to 3 days after infusion of BAX326. The other subject experienced 4 AEs of diarrhoea in a 9 month period 
which occurred 0.4 to 1.1 days following infusion of BAX326. None of these AEs were connected to an 
infection/infestation and no overall pattern can be observed. The occurrence of diarrhoea in the study 
population with 4/99 is lower than that observed in the general population (5.5% mild, 0.8% moderate 
and 0.3% severe). 
Headache: A total of 8 headaches were reported in 7/99 subjects of mild (5) or moderate (3) severity, 
all considered as not related by the investigator. The majority (5/7) started 2.3 to 5.8 days following the 
infusion of BAX326, in two cases it occurred between 0 to 0.4 days post-infusion. In 7 cases they were 
connected to an infection/infestation. The occurrence of headache in the study population is considerably 
lower than that reported for the general population which is 27.2% for mild severity, 9.5% for moderate 
and 1.3% for severe severity. The higher occurrence of headache in the general population and the 
variation in onset following the infusion of BAX326 precludes a relationship to BAX326. 
Hypertension: There were 4 cases of hypertension reported in 4/99 subjects , all of mild severity and all 
considered a not related by the investigator. The start date varies from 0 – 2 days following the previous 
BAX326 infusion. Two of the subjects have obesity in their medical history as a potential risk factor. A 
relationship to BAX326 is unlikely given the low incidence and the different onset of time following the 
previous BAX326 infusion. 
Pain in extremity: Four (4) subjects experienced pain in extremity in 5 cases consisting of “pain in 
hand” (2) in the same subject, “popliteal fossa pain” (1), “pain in the right forearm” (1) and “painful left 
foot” (1). The two instances of “pain in extremity” occurred in the same subject, apparently at the time of 
infusion. The severity and relationship of one AE was not provided by the investigator and thus 
conservatively classified as related by the sponsor. The other 3 cases occurred 1-3 days following the 
previous infusion of BAX326. Overall, a relationship to BAX326 can be ruled out given the different 
location and onset of the events. The two AEs of “pain in hand” are most likely due to injection of the 
product, but not BAX326 itself. 
Pyrexia: There were a total of 10 AEs of pyrexia in 9/99 subjects, all of mild severity and all considered 
as not related by the investigator. The onset of the AEs varied between 0 – 4 days following the previous 
infusion of BAX326 and 2 AEs occurred at postoperative day 1 and 3 respectively. Three (3) AEs in 3 
subjects were temporally related to infections/infestations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 88/103 
 
 
 
Thrombocytosis: A total of 5 AEs of thrombocytosis were reported in 5/99 subjects. The severity was 
mild except in one subject and all thrombocytoses were considered as not related by the investigator to 
BAX326. Four (4) cases occurred following surgery at postoperative days 6 – 17. A reactive 
thrombocytosis is a common reaction following a surgical intervention and a relationship can be ruled out. 
Adverse Events Considered Related to BAX326 
Of the 337 AEs reported for the subjects included in this integrated analysis, the only AEs rated as related 
to BAX326 by the investigator or the sponsor were 6 non-serious AEs in 5 (5.1%) subjects. Two subjects 
were reported to have a positive (and transient) rFurin antibody test result (1:80), one subject 
experience 1 AE of haemorrhagic anaemia and 2 AEs of dysgeusia in 1 subject were also reported. Of 
these 6 AEs, 3 were rated as mild, 2 as moderate and 1 AE was of unknown severity and causality (pain 
in extremity). The latter was conservatively considered related. 
Three of the AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to BAX326 were reported in Pivotal 
Study 250901: 
•  Dysgeusia: 2 AEs in 1 subject, both considered mild 
• 
Pain in extremity: 1 AE (at 1 day after BAX326 infusion, unknown severity and unknown 
relatedness and therefore conservatively rated in this analysis as related). 
Two AEs considered by the investigator to be related to BAX326 were reported in Continuation Study 
251001: 
•  Development of positive rFurin antibodies, titer 1:80: 2 AEs in 2 subjects, 1 considered of mild 
and 1 of moderate severity. 
One AE of haemorrhagic anaemia was reported and assessed by the investigator as related to BAX326 in 
Surgery Study 251002. Baxter considers this AE to be unrelated to BAX326 for the following reasons: 
Anaemia is the result of surgery and postoperative hematoma and a common AE in the peri-operative 
setting. The intraoperative BL was lower than the predicted average BL and the postoperative BL matched 
the predicted average BL. No transfusions were required. The subject had adequate haemostatic 
coverage based on his FIX levels except on postoperative days 1 and 3. 
No thrombotic events or severe allergic reactions were reported in any subject in the integrated analysis. 
In the paediatric study 251101, subject 130002 reported one adverse event of hypersensitivity, which 
was rated as mild and unlikely related and occurred 5.7 days after the last BAX326 infusion. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Of the 337 AEs reported for subjects in this integrated analysis, 10 (in 8 [8.1%] unique subjects) were 
considered by the investigator to be serious. None of the SAEs were considered related to Rixubis. The 
SAEs, by preferred term were as follows:

Laboratory findings 
Haematology and chemistry parameters were collected in the BAX326 clinical development program and 
assessed for clinical significance.  
The haematology panel consists of complete blood count [haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocytes (i.e. 
red blood cell count), and leukocytes (i.e. white blood cell count)] with differential (i.e. basophils, 
eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils), mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
haemoglobin concentration, and platelet count. 
The clinical chemistry panel consists of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, total protein, albumin, 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose. 
Two clinically significant haematology results were reported in 2 subjects 6-<12 years of age and 49 
clinically significant results in 29 subjects ≥16 years of age. Two subjects had abnormal haematology 
values reported as mild unrelated AEs (low haemoglobin titer reported as mild anaemia and elevated 
platelet count reported as mild thrombocytosis). 
Nine clinically significant clinical chemistry results were reported and 1 increased ALT value was reported 
as an AE in surgery 251102 study. 
No viral laboratory changes were observed except 1 seroconversion to hepatitis B core antibody. 
Furthermore, in trial 250901 thrombotic markers (prothrombin fragment 1.2, TAT complexes, D-dimer) 
were investigated. Thrombogenic marker levels were elevated in some subjects pre- and post-infusion of 
BAX326 as well as for BeneFIX. These abnormal results did not appear to correlate with infusion time or 
infused product.

No safety signals emerge from the laboratory findings. 
Safety in special populations 
Paediatric Use 
The safety and efficacy of BAX326 was investigated in the Phase 2/3 Paediatric Study 251101. BAX326 
was safe and well tolerated in 23 treated paediatric subjects (11 subjects <6 years and 12 subjects 6 to 
<12 years of age) during more than 3 months of prophylactic treatment (mean number of EDs to 
BAX326: 53.6 [± 6.11], median: 53.0, range: 35-70). No subjects developed inhibitors to FIX, and no 
subjects developed positive total binding antibodies to FIX, CHO proteins or to rFurin considered 
treatment related. There were no severe allergic reactions or thrombotic events. No significant 
treatment-related changes in laboratory values or vital signs were recorded. 
A total of 48 AEs occurred in 17 (73.9%) subjects; 30 AEs occurred in 10 (83.3%) subjects in the 
6-to-<12-year age cohort and 18 AEs occurred in 7 (63.6%) subjects in the <6-year age cohort. None of 
the AEs were considered treatment-related. Four unrelated SAEs (subcutaneous haemorrhage, humerus 
fracture, device-related infection, haemarthrosis) occurred in 3 subjects in the 6-to-<12-year age cohort; 
all 4 SAEs were resolved at the time of study completion. 
Geriatric Use 
Clinical studies of BAX326 do not include subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond 
differently from younger subjects. As for all patients, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
individualized. The use of BAX326 in patients ≥65 is expected to lead to a similar adverse event profile to 
that observed in the younger adults. 
Clinical studies of BAX326 do not include subjects aged 65 or more, patients weighing more 120 kg or less 
than 35 kg, subjects with abnormal renal function, subjects with severe active or chronic liver disease and 
women. However, special populations have been investigated according to GL requirements. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interactions of BAX326 with other medicinal products are known. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two subjects were withdrawn from Pivotal Study 250901 due to unrelated SAEs requiring emergency 
treatment with another, non-IP FIX product rendering them ineligible for further participation in the 
pivotal study.  
One subject  who was screened into study 250901 performed a suicide attempt before receiving Rixubis 
and did not continue with the clinical trial. 
All three discontinuations are not related to Rixubis. 
One paediatric patient discontinued the 251101 trial because his guardian felt that nonacog gamma 
efficacy was insufficient. 
Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety data in the pivotal, paediatric and surgery trial was done according to relevant 
guidelines. The size of the available safety database, 99 unique subjects of whom 23 are PTPs <12, 
exceeds guideline requirements. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 91/103 
 
 
 
A total of 337 AEs were reported in 80/99 (80.8%) patients treated with at least 1 infusion of Rixubis. The 
majority of AEs was non-serious (327/337) and considered unrelated to Rixubis (331/337). Overall, the 
majority of the non-serious AEs appear to have been related to mild infections or gastrointestinal 
diseases, abnormal immunology tests (indeterminate antibodies to FIX or rFurin) or arthralgia. Ten AEs in 
8 (8.1%) subjects were considered serious, and all of these were classified as being unrelated to Rixubis. 
Six non-serious AEs, of dysgeusia (2), pain in extremity, development of positive rFurin antibodies (2) 
and haemorrhagic anaemia, reported in 5/99 patients were considered to be related to Rixubis. 
No unexpected safety signals emerged throughout the clinical development programme. Rixubis 
appeared to be safe and well tolerated in paediatric and adult subjects during chronic administration of up 
to 83 exposure days as well as for the treatment of bleeding events and the peri- and postoperative use. 
No thromboembolic or severe allergic events occurred. No instances of inhibitor development were 
observed. Only 6 of 337 AEs were considered related to the administration of Rixubis in PTPs ≥12, while 
in PTPs <12 no related AEs were observed. In conclusion, the observed safety profile of Rixubis can be 
considered as benign.  
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely 
and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these reactions 
have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association with 
development of factor IX inhibitors (see SmPC section 4.8). Rixubis is contra-indicated when 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is present or known allergic reaction 
to hamster protein (See section 4.3 of the SmPC). Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported with Rixubis. The product contains traces of hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients or their caregivers should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product 
immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity 
reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and 
anaphylaxis. The risk is highest during the early phases of initial exposure to factor IX concentrates in 
previously untreated patients (PUPs), in particular in patients with high-risk gene mutations. There have 
been reports in the literature showing an association between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and 
allergic reactions, in particular in patients with a high-risk gene mutation. Therefore, patients 
experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. In case of shock, 
standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The following general safety aspects associated with this class of products in the clinical setting of 
haemophilia are reflected in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8:  
Inhibitor development has not been observed with Rixubis as discussed above, however this is an 
important aspect of Factor IX treatment as patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising 
antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an 
insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be 
contacted (see SmPC section 4.8). Precautions have been included in section 4.4 so that after repeated 
treatment with human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products, patients should be monitored for the 
development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using 
appropriate biological testing.  
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for 
the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an 
increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. Because of the risk of allergic 
reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 92/103 
 
 
 
treating physician’s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for 
allergic reactions could be provided. 
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B 
patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has been 
observed (see SmPC section 4.8).  
There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX products, 
with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has been associated 
with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, venous thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with such adverse reactions 
(see SmPC section 4.8). Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for 
early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological 
testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to 
new-born infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the 
benefit of treatment with Rixubis should be weighed against the risk of these complications (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the 
cardiovascular risk(see SmPC section 4.4).. 
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.83 mmol (19 mg) sodium per vial. To be taken into 
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet (see SmPC section 4.4).. 
Futhermore, if a central venous access device (CAVD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications 
including local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered(see SmPC 
section 4.4).. 
Clinical studies of Rixubis did not include subjects aged 65 and over. It is not known whether they 
respond differently from younger subjects. As for all patients, dose selection for an elderly patient should 
be individualised(see SmPC section 4.4). 
No interactions of human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have been 
reported(see SmPC section 4.5). 
As, animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX and based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding 
only if clearly indicated. There is no information on the effects of rFIX on fertility(see SmPC section 4.6). 
Adverse drug reactions reported were dysgeusia (1.01%) and pain in extremity (1.01%).  
The effects of higher than recommended doses of Rixubis have not been characterised (see SmPC section 
4.9). 
As discussed, frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same 
as in adults. However, no data are available on previously untreated patients as only previously treated 
patients have been enrolled in the clinical studies; no immunogenicity investigation on inhibitor 
development was therefore made in this at risk population(see SmPC section 4.8). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.8. 
Further information also with regard to previously untreated patients and treatment in patients with

severe  chronic  hepatic  disease  will  be  collected  through  registries  (e.g.  the  European  Haemophilia 
Safety Surveillance EUHASS registry, PedNet registry) and will be submitted for review on an on-going 
basis.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The extent and nature of the available safety data are considered adequate to support a marketing 
authorisation for Rixubis. Safety evaluation in general follows the currently valid Clinical Guideline. The 
presented results are considered to be acceptable.  
Particular emphasis during the analysis and discussion of the safety data was given on immunogenicity 
and development of FIX antibodies. Further studies and registry data (see pharmacovigilance plan, RMP) 
will monitor safety issues of special interest.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In study 250901 the mean ABR in the prophylactic cohort (n=56) was 4.26 (median: 1.99; range: 
0.0-23.4). Of a total of 249 BEs in the FAS, 115 BEs occurred during prophylactic treatment and 134 BEs 
occurred in the on-demand cohort (n=14). Haemostatic efficacy at resolution of bleed was rated 
‘excellent’ in 41.0% and ‘good’ in 55.0% of all treated BEs (total of 96.0%). Only 2.0% of bleed 
treatments were rated as ‘fair’, and none had a rating of ‘none’. For the remaining 2.0%, no efficacy 
ratings were provided. Of the 249 BEs, the majority (153; 61.4%) were treated with one infusion. Fifty 
(23.3%) BEs were treated with 2 infusions, and 38 (15.3%) BEs were treated with more than 3 infusions. 
In the paediatric study 251101 the mean ABR for all 23 subjects was 2.7 (median: 2.0; range: 0.0-10.8). 
Fourteen subjects (7 subjects in each age cohort) had a total of 26 BEs which were treated. The 
haemostatic efficacy of BEs treated with Rixubis was mostly rated ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ (25 of 26 BEs; 
96.2%), with only one rating of ‘fair’ and no ratings of ‘none’. Fifteen of a total of 26 BEs were controlled 
with 1 infusion. A further 8 BEs were controlled with 2 infusions. Three BEs were treated with 3 or more 
infusions until resolution of bleed.  
Efficacy of Rixubis in all surgeries included in the intraoperative assessment (n=14 in the FAS) had a 
rating of ‘excellent’. On postoperative day 3, all 6 surgeries in the FAS where no drain was employed, had 
a rating of ‘excellent” and at drain removal, and at discharge from hospital the ratings were either 
‘excellent’ or ‘good’. Four subjects in the FAS, who all underwent major (orthopaedic) surgery received 
blood product transfusions, either in the form of packed red blood cells (PRBC) or fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP). In the FAS, the mean volume transfused was 725.3 (334.8) mL during the intraoperative period 
(range: 520-1225 mL) and 575 mL during the postoperative period. 
Submitted data are considered sufficient to demonstrate efficacy of BAX326 for prevention and treatment 
of bleeds in patients with Haemophilia B as well as efficacy during surgery. A pooled analysis of the two 
studies 250901 and 251101 for the annualized bleeding rate (for prophylactic treatment), resulting in an 
informative confidence interval, the estimated annualized bleeding rate lying within 2.8 and 5.0 bleeds 
per year.  
Patients on prophylaxis reported improvements between baseline and follow-up at approximately 6 
months in the HR-QoL measures such as physical Component Score and the Bodily Pain (and Role Physical 
domains of the SF-36 in addition to the EQ-5D VAS Score. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is no knowledge of the benefit of Rixubis in previously untreated patients, however this is reflected 
in the SmPC and it is anticipated that data will be collected on an on-going basis via registries (see 
discussion on clinical safety and RMP). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The size of the safety database available at the moment exceeds guideline requirements, and the nature 
and frequency of the adverse events reported do not give rise to concern and do not reveal unexpected 
safety signals. Only a small proportion of observed AEs (6/337) were assessed as related to Rixubis by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 100/103 
 
 
 
 
 
investigators: dysgeusia (2), pain in extremity (1), anti Furin antibodies (2), postoperative anaemia (1). 
No related SAEs occurred and importantly, no inhibitor development, thromboembolic event or severe 
allergic reactions were observed. However, 35 patients developed 43 instances of anti-RFIX and/or 
anti-rFurin antibodies throughout the clinical development program. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As for all diseases with a low incidence and prevalence, the size of the safety database pre-authorisation 
is quite small. However, the database will be expanded by data gathered in the ongoing extension study 
(251001) and surgery study (251002).  
In view of the dependency of clotting assay results on the aPTT reagent used in the one-stage clotting 
assay (some reagents giving results 40% above the labelled potency), “underdosing of Rixubis” was 
discussed as a potential risk due to these highly variable results and to propose how to communicate this 
issue to the user, however it was considered that the variability of aPTT reagents in aPTT potency tests is 
not clearly understood and the root cause of the issue has not been elucidated. Therefore ‘Insufficient 
data regarding the degree to which factor IX levels can be affected by the aPTT reagent in aPTT potency 
assay’ has been included as Missing Information in the Risk Management Plan. Furthermore, a statement 
has been included in the SmPC (section 4.2) to make healthcare professionals aware that plasma factor 
IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference 
standard used in the assay. 
No data are available for previously untreated patients, and it is not known if the incidence of inhibitors or 
other adverse events will be comparable to PUPs treated with already licensed factor IX products. The 
PDCO has waived the need to conduct a PUP study in the approved PIP, because nonacog gamma is not 
considered a novel FIX product, however data from registries are expected to be collected post- 
authorisation (See Risk Management Plan). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Factor IX replacement with the aim of preventing and treating bleeding events is of paramount 
importance for patients with haemophilia B in order to enable work, school and social activities and to 
prevent long-term sequelae of repeat bleeds. Rixubis has been shown to be able to prevent and treat 
bleeding events as well as allow surgical intervention in paediatric and adult patients with haemophilia B. 
The observed unfavourable effects were generally benign and did not negatively impact the patients’ 
ability and willingness to continue treatment with Rixubis. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The beneficial effects of Rixubis clearly outweigh the unfavourable effects therefore the benefit-risk 
balance for Rixubis in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B 
(congenital factor IX deficiency) is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Assessment report  
EMA/702760/2014 
Page 101/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor 
IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a 
result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is 
increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the 
bleeding tendencies. 
The submitted data are sufficient to provide relevant information on general safety and tolerability 
aspects and to demonstrate the efficacy of Rixubis in terms of its ability to raise factor IX levels and 
promote haemostasis and to stop as well as to prevent bleeding events as requested by the guideline. In 
patients on prophylaxis statistically significant improvements in health- related quality of life measures 
were also seen.  
Post-marketing investigations from on-going trials and registries are expected to provide information on 
the treatment in PUPs and long-term safety including inhibitor development.

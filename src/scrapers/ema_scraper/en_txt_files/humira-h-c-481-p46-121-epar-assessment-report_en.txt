• 
M11-290, A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of the Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal 
Antibody Adalimumab in Pediatric Subjects with Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis 
The main study results were submitted as a Type II variation to add the paediatric ulcerative colitis 
indication that is currently under review (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0198). This submission is the final 
report for Study M11-290 that contains an exploratory re-run of efficacy analyses and final safety 
analyses based on subjects enrolled at all study sites, including Japan. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Treatment was given with either placebo or Humira (adalimumab) prefilled syringe 40 mg/0.8 mL 
solution for injection. This formulation is approved for various paediatric indications.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Clinical study 
M11-290, A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of the Human 
Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab in Pediatric Subjects with 
Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis 
Description 
Study M11-290 was a Phase 3, randomized, double blind (DB) trial designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with moderate to severe UC who have failed therapy 
with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant (IMM). 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety, and to assess the 
pharmacokinetics of adalimumab administered subcutaneously in paediatric subjects with moderate-to-
severe UC. 
Study design 
Prior to Amendment 4, enrolled subjects were randomized 3:2 at Baseline to 1 of 2 DB adalimumab 
induction doses, induction high dose (I-HD) or induction standard dose (I-SD).  At Week 8, subjects

demonstrating a clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS) were randomized to the following 
groups in a 2:2:1 ratio:  adalimumab maintenance standard dose (M-SD), adalimumab maintenance 
high dose (M-HD), or placebo.  Subjects continued their blinded treatment during the maintenance 
period until Week 52. 
After Amendment 4, enrolled subjects receive adalimumab induction high dose open-label (I-HD-
OL).  At Week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response per PMS were randomized and stratified by 
Week 8 remission status per PMS in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 adalimumab maintenance treatment groups, 
M-SD or M-HD.  Subjects continued their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 
52. 
Prior to Amendment 4, internal placebo was chosen as the control group during maintenance period.  
Over the course of study, there were significant recruitment difficulties (the primary reason being 
objection to the placebo group in the maintenance period) despite efforts to reduce subject burden and 
study complexity.  As a result, after Amendment 4, per agreement with the regulatory agencies, 
randomization to the internal placebo group was ceased, and external placebo derived from a meta-
analysis of placebo-controlled studies in adult subjects with moderate to severe UC who had failed 
conventional therapy was used as comparator for the confirmatory analysis of co-primary and ranked 
secondary efficacy endpoints instead. 
The duration of the study was up to 66 weeks, which included a screening period of up to 28 days, an 
8-week induction period and a 44-week DB maintenance period and a 70-day follow-up phone call.  
Upon completion of the study, subjects had the option to enroll into an OLE study (Study M10-870 
Main) where they continued to receive OL adalimumab.

Study population /Sample size 
Paediatric subjects with moderate to severe UC (Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy sub score 
of 2 to 3) from 4 to less than 18 years old, who have failed therapy with corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressant (IMM) were eligible for the study. 
Sample size was determined as displayed in Table 1. In addition, approximately 20 subjects were 
planned to be included in the Japan Substudy.

Changes to the sample size calculation:  
The sample size was changed in amendment 5 to 93 patients for the main study and up to 
approximately 9 subjects for the Japan Substudy.  The ordering of the secondary endpoints was 
changed. Here a 48% remission rate per PMS at Week 8 for the combined standard and high 
adalimumab induction dose groups was assumed. A 52% remission rate per PMS at Week 8 for the 
high adalimumab induction dose group was assumed. 
Treatments 
Prior to Amendment 4, 
Subjects randomized to I-HD group receive adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum dose of 160 mg) at 
Baseline and at Week 1, 1.2 mg/kg (maximum dose of 80 mg) at Week 2, followed by 0.6 mg/kg 
(maximum dose of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6.   
Subjects randomized to I-SD group receive adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum dose of 160 mg) at 
Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, 1.2 mg/kg (maximum dose of 80 mg) at Week 2, followed 
by 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) at Week 4 and Week 6.   
At Week 8, subjects randomized to M-SD group receive 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) every 
other week (eow), and subjects randomized to M-HD group receive 0.6mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 
mg) every week (ew).  
After Amendment 4, enrolled subjects (I-HD-OL group) receive adalimumab 2.4 mg/kg (maximum 
dose of 160 mg) at Baseline and at Week 1, 1.2mg/kg (maximum dose of 80 mg) at Week 2, followed 
by 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg) at Week4 and Week 6.  At Week 8, subjects received either 
M-SD or M-HD.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary efficacy endpoints: 
1.  The proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission at Week 8 as measured by PMS 
(defined as a PMS ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) 
2.  The proportion of subjects who responded at Week 8 per PMS and achieve clinical remission at 
Week 52 as measured by Mayo score (defined as a Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no individual 
subscore> 1). 
Ranked secondary efficacy endpoints: 
1.  Proportion of subjects in Mayo clinical response at Week 52 in Week 8 responders per PMS; 
2.  Proportion of subjects who achieve mucosal healing at Week 52 as measured by Mayo 
endoscopy subscore (defined as ≤ 1) in Week 8 responders per PMS 
3.  Proportion of subjects who achieve Mayo clinical remission at Week 52 in Week 8 remitters per 
PMS; 
4.  Proportion of subjects receiving corticosteroid at Baseline who have discontinued corticosteroid 
prior to Week 52 and are in Mayo clinical remission at Week 52 in Week 8 responders per PMS. 
Statistical Methods 
The efficacy analysis was performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population for the Week 8 efficacy 
endpoints and in the modified ITT (mITT) population for the Week 52 efficacy endpoints.  The ITT-E 
population is a subpopulation of the ITT population (includes all subjects who received at least one 
dose of the study medication during induction period), where subjects who received open-label high 
induction dose are excluded.  The mITT population consists of all Week 8 PMS Responders who were 
randomized at Week 8 and received at least one dose of the study medication during maintenance 
period.  The non-responder imputation (NRI) was used to impute missing values for binary efficacy 
endpointsMissing values were only to be imputed for study periods which a subject had actually 
entered,  Subjects who received rescue therapy during the maintenance period were considered as 
failures from that time point forward. Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case 
analyses were performed for continuous efficacy endpoints. 
In order to derive robust external placebo assumptions for the co-primary and ranked secondary 
endpoints, a thorough literature search of placebo-controlled clinical studies in subjects with moderate 
to severe UC who had failed conventional therapy was performed.  Studies M06-826 and M06-827 in 
adults and Studies GEMINI 1 and OCTAVE Sustain in adults were chosen based on a number of criteria.  
For all co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints where available, separate estimates for anti-tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) naïve placebo patients and anti-TNF experienced placebo patients were derived 
by endpoint.  The estimates for anti-TNF naïve placebo patients and anti-TNF experienced placebo 
patients were then combined as a weighted mean according to the assumed proportion of anti-TNF 
naïve and experienced subjects.  To be conservative, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for 
the weighted mean was used as the external placebo assumption.  
Japan Substudy Only  
Efficacy analyses were performed for subjects enrolled at sites outside of Japan (Main Study), for 
subjects enrolled at sites in Japan (Japan Substudy), and for subjects enrolled at all sites (Integrated 
population).

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 101 subjects at 24 sites (93 subjects at 19 global sites outside of Japan [Austria, Belgium, 
Canada, Spain, United Kingdom, Israel, Poland, Slovakia, and the United States]; 8 subjects at 5 sites 
in Japan) enrolled in Study M11-290.  All 101 enrolled subjects were included in the Integrated intent-
to-treat (ITT) and Safety Populations.  The Integrated ITT-E Population (83 subjects) excluded subjects 
who received I-HD-OL and was the primary population for the confirmatory Induction period efficacy 
analyses for the Japan Substudy.  The Integrated modified ITT (mITT) Population (80 subjects) 
included all Week 8 PMS responders who were randomized at Week 8 and received at least 1 dose of 
the study medication during the Maintenance period.  The Integrated modified ITT-E Population (mITT-
E; 68 subjects) excluded subjects who received placebo and was the primary population for the 
confirmatory Maintenance period efficacy analyses for the Japan Substudy. A total of 6 subjects were 
included in the Japanese ITT-E and mITT populations. 
Baseline data 
In the Integrated ITT/Safety Population, the mean age was 14.1± 2.90 years at enrollment, ranging 
from 5 to 17 years.  There was 1 more female subject (51, 50.5%) than male subjects.  The majority 
of subjects were White (88, 87.1%), resided in Eastern Europe (72,71.3%), had no prior exposure to 
anti-TNF (85, 84.2%), and had IMM use (63, 62.4%) at Baseline.  About half had no systemic 
corticosteroid use (52, 51.5%) at Baseline. In the Integrated ITT/Safety Population, the mean duration 
of UC was 2.4 ± 2.28 years at Baseline, ranging from 0.3 to 11.4 years.  At this time, the sites of UC 
were left sided UC (38, 37.6%) and extensive UC/pancolitis (63, 62.4%), and the mean Mayo Score 
and mean PMS was 7.8 ± 1.20 and 5.6 ± 1.17, respectively (Table 2).

Table 2. Demographic Characteristics (Integrated ITT/Safety Population) 
The most frequently reported prior UC-related medications were mesalazine (83.2%), azathioprine 
(AZA; 71.3%), and prednisone (47.5%)/prednisolone (8.9%); all other prior UC-related medications 
were used by < 20% of subjects (Integrated ITT/Safety population).  These medications were also the 
most frequently reported UC-related medications at Baseline: mesalazine (77.2%), AZA (59.4%), and 
prednisone (26.7%)/prednisolone (5.9%), respectively, for the Integrated ITT/Safety population.  All 
other baseline UC-related medications were reported by < 9% of subjects for the Integrated 
ITT/Safety population.  
Efficacy results (exploratory re-run of the primary efficacy analysis) 
Co-primary endpoint 
The first co-primary endpoint, clinical remission per PMS at Week 8, was achieved by 58.8% of 
subjects randomized to adalimumab I-HD group and 40.6% of subjects randomized to the I-SD group 
(Integrated ITT-E population) (Table 3).

According to the applicant, efficacy results for the Japan ITT-E and mITT-E populations were consistent 
with the results for the respective Integrated ITT populations. 
Safety results 
Overall, 81 of the 101 (80.2%) subjects in the Integrated Safety population experienced at least 1 
TEAE with adalimumab exposure, including adalimumab as rescue therapy after a disease flare (Table

5). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates are shown below. No death, malignancy, active tuberculosis 
(TB), or demyelinating disorder were reported throughout the study. According to the applicant, 
serious AEs and TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were low in frequency and consistent with 
the underlying disorder.

Patient-Years (PYS) of overall ADA exposure Throughout the Study (Integrated Safety Population) 
In the Japan Safety population, 8 subjects (100%) experienced at least 1 TEAE (33 E [589.3 E/100 
PYs]), Table 6.

For the Japan Safety population, no subject experienced an SAE and 1 subject (I-SD) had a TEAE 
leading to study drug discontinuation during Induction; 1 subject (M-SD) had an SAE during 
Maintenance. The proportion of subjects who experienced TEAEs assessed by the investigator as 
having at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug was low and similar between the 
I-SD and the I-HD groups during Induction and the M-SD and M-HD groups during Maintenance 
(Integrated Safety population).  According to the applicant, most TEAEs were mild to moderate in 
severity during both Induction and Maintenance (Integrated Safety population). 
For the Integrated Safety population, the system organ classes (SOCs) with the most frequently 
reported TEAEs (≥ 20% of adalimumab-treated subjects) during Induction and Maintenance up to the 
first disease flare were Infections and Infestations (22.8% and 40.7%, respectively) and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (19.8% and 27.2%, respectively).  The most frequently reported (≥ 5% of 
subjects) TEAEs by preferred term (PT) during Induction were headache, anaemia, colitis ulcerative, 
and nasopharyngitis; the most frequently reported TEAEs by PT during Maintenance up to the first 
disease flare in subjects who received adalimumab were colitis ulcerative, headache, nasopharyngitis, 
upper respiratory infection, anaemia, and pharyngitis. Slightly higher incidences of colitis ulcerative, 
headache, and anaemia were reported in subjects who received the adalimumab standard dose 
regimens compared with subjects who were treated with the high dose regimens.  
Injection site reactions and infections were the only AESIs reported by subjects in Japan (Table 7).

According to the applicant, the safety results for the subjects in Japan were consistent with the results 
for the integrated population, and consistent with the established safety profile of adalimumab and 
with the underlying colitis disorder. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study M11-290 was a Phase 3, randomized, double blind (DB) trial designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with moderate to severe UC who have failed therapy 
with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant (IMM). The study consisted of a Main Study 
(conducted in subjects enrolled outside of Japan,) and a Japan Substudy (conducted in subjects 
enrolled at sites in Japan only).  
The main study results were submitted as a Type II variation to add the paediatric ulcerative colitis 
indication that is currently under review (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0198). At time for data cut-off for that 
submission (March 2020), the Japanese substudy was not yet finalised. This submission pertains to the 
final report for Study M11-290 that contains an exploratory re-run of efficacy analyses and final safety 
analyses based on subjects enrolled at all study sites, including Japan. 
Details on the study design has been assessed within variation II/198 and the assessment is not 
repeated here.  
Prior to Amendment 4, enrolled subjects were randomized 3:2 at Baseline to 1 of 2 DB adalimumab 
induction doses, induction high dose (I-HD) or induction standard dose (I-SD).  At Week 8, subjects 
demonstrating a clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS) were randomized to the following 
groups in a 2:2:1 ratio:  adalimumab maintenance standard dose (M-SD), adalimumab maintenance 
high dose (M-HD), or placebo.  Subjects continued their blinded treatment during the maintenance 
period until Week 52. 
After Amendment 4, enrolled subjects receive adalimumab induction high dose open-label (I-HD-
OL).  At Week 8, subjects demonstrating a clinical response per PMS were randomized and stratified by 
Week 8 remission status per PMS in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 adalimumab maintenance treatment groups,

M-SD or M-HD. Subjects continued their blinded treatment during the maintenance period until Week 
52. 
The duration of the study was up to 66 weeks, which included a screening period of up to 28 days, an 
8-week induction period and a 44-week DB maintenance period and a 70-day follow-up phone call.  
Upon completion of the study, subjects had the option to enrol into an OLE study (Study M10-870 
Main) where they continued to receive OL adalimumab. 
The recommended maintenance dose in the UC population is doubled compared to the standard 
maintenance dose in the paediatric Crohn’s disease population. This is further discussed in variation 
II/198. 
A total of 101 subjects at 24 sites (93 subjects at 19 global sites outside of Japan; 8 subjects at 5 sites 
in Japan) enrolled in Study M11-290.  All 101 enrolled subjects were included in the Integrated intent-
to-treat (ITT) and Safety Populations. 
The first co-primary endpoint, clinical remission per PMS at Week 8, was achieved by 58.8% of 
subjects randomized to adalimumab I-HD group and 40.6% of subjects randomized to the I-SD group 
(Integrated ITT-E population). In the Japanese subpopulation, a total of 2/6 patients (33.3%) achieved 
clinical remission. Although the response rates (also for secondary endpoints) were numerically lower 
in the Japanese subpopulation, the comparison is hampered by the limited number of study subjects. 
With regards to safety, overall, 81 of the 101 (80.2%) subjects in the Integrated Safety population 
experienced at least 1 TEAE with adalimumab exposure. In the Japan Safety population, 8 subjects 
(100%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. For the Japan Safety population, no subject experienced an SAE 
and 1 subject had a TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation during Induction; 1 subject had an SAE 
during Maintenance (worsening of ulcerative colitis). No death, malignancy, active tuberculosis (TB), or 
demyelinating disorder were reported throughout the study. Injection site reactions and infections 
were the only AESIs reported by subjects in Japan. 
According to the applicant, the safety results for the subjects in Japan were consistent with the results 
for the integrated population, and consistent with the established safety profile of adalimumab and 
with the underlying colitis disorder. This is agreed by CHMP. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The presented data includes additional data for 8 Japanese children, not included in the interim data 
from study M11-290 submitted in variation II/198 to support the new indication of paediatric ulcerative 
colitis. With regard to efficacy, the response rates were numerically lower in the Japanese 
subpopulation, however the comparison is hampered by the very limited number of study subjects. 
Regarding safety, it is agreed by CHMP that the safety results for the subjects in Japan were consistent 
with the results for the integrated population, and consistent with the established safety profile of 
adalimumab and with the underlying colitis disorder. No new safety signals evoked.

Nivolumab (Opdivo) is a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) blocking antibody that is currently 
approved in the EU in indications for melanoma (as monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab), 
lung cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma. The CHMP recently gave a positive 
opinion on an extension of indication to include treatment of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck 
(SCCHN) in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy for Opdivo as monotherapy. The 
approved dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy for the approved indications is 3 mg/kg 
administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes Q2W.  
Problem statement 
Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the world, with approximately 430,000 new cases 
(330,380 in men and 99,413 in women) diagnosed in 2012. It is three times more prevalent in men than 
in women, resulting in 123,051 deaths in men and 42,033 deaths in women in 2012. In the EU, bladder 
cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer, with approximately 124,188 new cases and 40,635 
resulting deaths reported in 20121. 
Urothelial carcinoma (UC), also known as transitional cell carcinoma, is the most common type of bladder 
cancer, accounting for 90% of cases. Among patients diagnosed with UC, the majority have non-muscle 
invasive (approximately half) or localised muscle-invasive disease (approximately 1 in 3) at the time of 
diagnosis, with the remaining patients having metastatic disease. Approximately 50% of patients 
presenting with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer eventually develop metastatic recurrence after therapy 
for clinically localised disease. The most important risk factor identified in bladder cancer is smoking, with 
the presence of visceral or liver metastases, ECOG performance scores greater than 0, and baseline 
hemoglobin lower than 10 g/dL predicting worse clinical outcomes for patients with advanced or 
metastatic disease after platinum failure.  
For patients with advanced and metastatic UC, standard first-line treatment involves platinum-based 
combination chemotherapy2. Despite responses in 40 - 60% of patients with advanced UC receiving first-
line cisplatin-based chemotherapy, disease progression occurs in nearly all patients at a median of about 
8 months3. In addition, 50% of patients are cisplatin-ineligible due to poor performance status, impaired

renal function, or comorbidity4. These patients receive carboplatin regimens such as 
gemcitabine+carboplatin, which offer a response rate of 41% and a median PFS of 5.8 months 5.  
Adverse prognostic factors for survival for patients with advanced and metastatic disease failing platinum-
based chemotherapy have been defined (PS >0, haemoglobin level <10 g/dl, and the presence of liver 
metastasis)6. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or 
following platinum-containing chemotherapy, there is no global standard of care. ESMO guidelines2 
recommend second-line treatment with single-agent vinflunine, taxanes, or enrollment in clinical trials. 
Standard regimens described in the NCCN Guidelines7 are taxanes (i.e., paclitaxel or docetaxel), 
gemcitabine, pemetrexed, and atezolizumab which are only approved in the US.  
The MAH applied for the following indication: Opdivo is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced 
unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing 
therapy. 
The recommended indication is: Opdivo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced 
unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy 
(see SmPC section 5.1). 
The recommended dose of Opdivo in the above indication is 3 mg/kg nivolumab administered 
intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks which is consistent with existing approved dose and 
schedule of nivolumab monotherapy in adults (see SmPC section 5.2). Treatment with Opdivo should be 
continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk 
to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is exempt from ERA studies as the 
product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is 
acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical studies is acceptable given that no changes to the SmPC section 5.3 have been 
proposed. Nivolumab is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology data in this application support the proposed use of nivolumab as monotherapy 
for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have disease 
progression during or following a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen or within 12 months of 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.  
The recommended dose and schedule is 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), which is the same as that 
approved for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
The PK of nivolumab in subjects with solid tumours and cHL have been previously characterised by PPK 
analysis. Nivolumab PK in these analyses was described by a stationary model, in which nivolumab CL 
was constant with respect to time. However, in a subsequent exploratory analysis following guidance 
from the US FDA, it was found that nivolumab CL tended to decrease with time. A PPK model with time-
varying CL was thus used to characterise the nivolumab serum concentration-time profile in subjects with

multiple solid tumours and cHL, including subjects with UC (subjects from a Phase ½ study, Study 
CA209032 and a Phase 2 single arm trial with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, Study CA209275, were included). 
An assessment of the effect of the following covariates on nivolumab PK was also performed: body weight 
(BW), age, sex, race, hepatic function status, eGFR, baseline performance status (PS) and tumour type.  
Pharmacokinetics in UC - Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PPK analysis was performed using data from 3458 subjects with solid tumours or cHL. The analysis 
population consisted of all subjects enrolled in studies who received nivolumab monotherapy, and for 
whom nivolumab concentration values were available. 
These studies were selected to enable a robust characterisation of nivolumab PK in the following tumour 
types: NSCLC, melanoma, RCC, SCCHN, UC, gastric carcinoma (GC), and cHL, as well as Phase 1 studies 
in which there was intense PK sampling. 
The PPK model development consisted of: 1) Base Model to re-assess the structural model, in particular 
time-varying CL, and 2) Full Model to assess the effect of covariates on nivolumab PK, which included an 
assessment of tumour type (including UC vs NSCLC 2L+) effect on nivolumab CL, and 3) Final model to 
attain the parsimonious model including significant covariates on nivolumab PK, which was further utilised 
for model applications. 
The Final Model was a two-compartment, zero-order IV infusion with time-varying CL (sigmoidal-Emax 
function) with a proportional residual error model, random effect on CL, VC, VP and Emax, and correlation 
of random effects between CL and VC. The final PPK model, contained baseline BWT (BBWT), eGFR, PS, 
sex, race and tumour type on CL and BBWT and sex on VC and the parameter estimates are described in 
the table below.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/392346/2017 
Page 10/106 
 
  
  
 
 
The model estimated Emax (CLEMAX, -0.311, Table 2), indicates that nivolumab CL decreases with time, 
and that the maximal decrease is approximately 26% [calculated as: 1 −exp(Emax)]. The change in CL is 
estimated to occur soon after initiation of treatment, with the half-maximal change estimated to occur at 
approximately 2 months (T50 = 1400 h). The geometric mean CL of 10.8 mL/h after the first dose 
reaches a steady-state value of 7.91 mL/h. 
The results of the PPK analysis indicated that the PK of nivolumab was linear in the dose range of 0.1 to 
20 mg/kg. 
A summary of the individual PK parameter estimates obtained from the final PPK model is provided in 
Table 3. 
Table 3 Summary Statistics of individual PK parameter Values (N=3458) 
The geometric mean Cavgss in all subjects administered 3 mg/kg Q2W was 86.6 μg/mL. 
Analysis of Covariate Effects 
Inferences regarding the effect of covariates were based upon the full model parameter estimates, which 
incorporated all pre-specified covariate parameter relationships of interest into the model. 
The effects of categorical (tumour type, race, performance status, hepatic function and sex) and 
continuous covariates (eGFR, age and body weight) on PK parameters (CL and VC) in the full covariate 
model are summarized in Figure 1. The assessment for the effect of solid tumors on CL was done by 
including a separate parameter for each solid tumor type, except for cHL. 
The effect of the following covariates were found to be statistically significant on nivolumab CL: baseline 
body weight (BBWT), performance status (PS), sex, race (Asian), tumor type (GC), eGFR; and the effect 
of BBWT and sex were found to be significant on nivolumab VC. The magnitude of the effect of covariates 
on CL, accounting for uncertainty, was within the ± 20% boundaries for all covariates, except baseline 
body weight. Sex appears to have some level of effect on CL and VC; it was close the ± 20% boundary 
for CL and VC, where female subjects had lower CL and VC than males.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
E-R analyses for safety and efficacy in subjects with UC from study CA209275 and CA209032 (UC arm) 
were not conducted, as data were available from only one dose level.  
The rate of AE-DC/D in studies CA209032 (UC cohort) and CA209275 was similar to that seen in previous 
studies (see clinical safety). 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W monotherapy has been well characterised in the 
nivolumab development program across multiple tumour types. An updated immunogenicity analysis 
integrated with data from studies CA209032 and CA209275 was presented. 
Study CA209032: 
Nine subjects (13.0%) were ADA positive following administration of nivolumab. No subject was 
considered persistent positive and one subject was neutralising ADA positive. The titer values observed in 
ADA positive subjects ranged from 1 to 8. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/392346/2017 
Page 12/106 
 
  
  
 
 
Only 1 ADA positive subject (not neutralising ADA positive) had Grade 1 hypersensitivity/infusion reaction 
on Day 1 after the first dose of nivolumab. Given that this subject was ADA positive on Days 1 (baseline), 
15, 29, and 99 and continued to receive nivolumab treatment for 6 months with no other occurrences of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction, it is unlikely that the Day 1 occurrence was ADA related. Thus, there 
were no apparent effects of nivolumab immunogenicity on safety in nivolumab monotherapy treated UC 
subjects in this study. 
Among 9 ADA positive subjects, 1 had CR, 1 had PR, 4 had a SD, and 3 (including the neutralising ADA 
positive subject) had a PD.  
Study CA209275: 
Fifty-two subjects (23.7%) were ADA positive following administration of nivolumab. No subject was 
considered persistent positive and four subjects were neutralising ADA positive. In all ADA positive 
subjects the ADA titres were low, ranging from 1 to 32. 
Hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions were not observed in any ADA positive subjects. Thus, the 
presence of ADA was not associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity and/or infusion-related 
reactions in Study CA209275. Of the 52 subjects that were ADA positive, 1 subject had a BOR of CR, 6 
subjects had a BOR of PR, and 9 subjects had a BOR of SD. Thus, approximately 30% of the ADA positive 
subjects had a response of CR, PR, or had SD. This response was consistent to the overall response 
observed in CA209275, which included the ADA negative subjects.  
Table 4 Summary of nivolumab antibody assessments using method ICDIM 140 following 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
To further explore the relationship between immunogenicity and safety, an integrated assessment of the 
potential impact of nivolumab ADA on immunogenicity-related effects was performed by summarising the

select adverse events in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category by ADA Status (positive or 
negative) for those subjects who were treated with nivolumab monotherapy. 
Data was available from studies CA209063, CA209037, CA209066, CA209017, CA209057, CA209067, 
CA209025, CA209039 (cHL all), CA209205 (cohorts A+B+C), CA209141, CA209032 (UC subjects), and 
CA209275. Of the 2071 subjects evaluable for the presence of ADA and hypersensitivity/infusion 
reactions, a total of 116 experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. Of the 116 subjects who 
experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, 5 were positive for nivolumab ADA and 111 were 
negative for nivolumab ADA. A total of 5/241 (2.07%) ADA positive subjects experienced adverse events 
in the hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category. 
•  One subject that was ADA positive (in Study CA209037) had an ADA positive status only for the 
last sample and experienced a Grade 1 hypersensitivity reaction after the first nivolumab dose 
when the ADA status was negative. 
•  One subject from Study CA209067 (monotherapy arm) had one ADA positive sample after one 
dose of nivolumab. This subject then continued nivolumab treatment, but ADA samples that were 
collected after 4 and 7 weeks of treatment were negative. This subject experienced 
bronchospasm prior to the last ADA sample at 7 weeks after initiation of treatment. Thus, the 
bronchospasm was not associated with the positive ADA status. 
• 
Two subjects from Study CA209057 were ADA positive and had Grade 1-2 infusion related 
reactions on the same day. These subjects went on to receive additional nivolumab doses and 
mADA were not detectable in subsequent assessments. 
•  One subject from Study CA209032 had Grade 1 hypersensitivity/infusion reaction on Day 1 after 
the first dose of nivolumab. Given that this subject was ADA positive on Days 1 (baseline), 15, 
29, and 99 and continued to receive nivolumab treatment for 6 months with no other occurrences 
of hypersensitivity/infusion reaction, it is unlikely that the Day 1 occurrence was ADA related. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A new PPK model has been developed for the evaluation of the PK of subjects that received nivolumab for 
the treatment of solid tumours (including the new urothelial cancer (UC) indication) as well as patients 
with cHL. Following FDA guidance, the applicant has now characterised nivolumab CL as time-dependent, 
rather than constant as considered in the previously developed PPK models. 
Nivolumab PK was described by a linear 2-compartiment model with time decreasing CL (~26%). The 
estimated parameters were similar to the estimated parameters from the previous final models and 
remain in line with what could be expected for an IgG monoclonal antibody (CL=0.0108 L/h; VC=4.26 L; 
VP=2.64 L). The effect of baseline body weight (BBWT) was found to be statistically significant and 
clinically relevant on both nivolumab CL and VC in line with previous PPK models. The effect of sex, race 
(Asian), PS, and eGFR are unlikely to be clinically relevant. Sex appears to have some level of effect on 
CL and VC; it was close the ± 20% boundary for CL and VC, where female subjects had lower CL and VC 
than males. These results are in alignment with the previous reported analyses, and the magnitude of the 
effect of PS, body weight and eGFR on CL, and the effect of sex and body weight on VC are comparable to 
what was previously reported in other solid tumour populations including RCC, NSCLC and melanoma.  
Overall, no relevant changes are observed in the estimated PK parameters of the effect of covariables on 
nivolumab PK compared to previous models. The SmPC has been changed according to the new 
estimated parameters (see SmPC section 5.2).

Nivolumab has low immunogenic potential. The pooled analysis of all tumour types showed that 
approximately 11% of subjects who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
monotherapy tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-nivolumab antibody. There is no apparent 
effect of ADA on efficacy of nivolumab. 
The impact of immunogenicity on nivolumab clearance has been assessed as part of the PPK analyses as 
a time-varying covariate, and was associated with a 14% increase in nivolumab CL, which was not 
considered clinically relevant.  
Overall immunogenicity results are in line with previous information (see also clinical safety).  
The applicant did not conduct E-R analysis in subjects with UC from study CA209275 and CA209032 (UC 
arm) as data were available from only one dose level which would limit the interpretability of the data. 
This is considered acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A new PPK model including time-dependent CL, has been developed for the evaluation of the PK of 
subjects that received nivolumab for the treatment of solid tumours (including the new urothelial cancer 
(UC) indication) as well as patients with cHL. No relevant changes are observed in the estimated PK 
parameters or the effect of covariables on nivolumab PK compared to previous models. The SmPC has 
been changed according to the new estimated parameters. 
The updated immunogenicity data is in line with previous analysis showing that nivolumab has low 
immunogenic potential. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study was submitted. The dose and schedule of nivolumab, 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 
60 minutes Q2W was selected for CA209275 and CA209032 based upon the collective experience of 
nivolumab monotherapy across multiple tumour types i.e. for melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, and classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma. 
2.4.2.  Main studies

Treatments 
Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered as a 60 minute IV infusion Q2W. Subjects received treatment with 
nivolumab on Day 1 of a treatment cycle every 2 weeks (14 days). No pre-medications were 
recommended on the first cycle.

Dose delays were permitted. 
Prior palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug 
administration. 
Treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST, version 1.1-defined progression was permitted if 
the patient experienced a clinical benefit, did not have rapid disease progression, and was tolerating 
study drug as determined by the investigator. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the CA209275 study was to estimate ORR based on (BIRC) assessments of 
nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with tumour expressing PD-L1 (membranous staining in ≥ 5% and ≥ 
1% tumor cells) and overall treated subjects with metastatic or surgically unresectable UC who have 
progressed or recurred following treatment with a platinum agent. 
The secondary objectives were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) based on BIRC assessments in subjects with tumor 
expressing PD-L1 (membranous staining in 5% and 1% tumour cells) and overall subjects treated 
with nivolumab monotherapy. 
To evaluate overall survival (OS) in subjects with tumour expressing PD-L1 (membranous staining 
in 5% and 1% tumor cells) and overall subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy. 
To estimate investigator assessed ORR in subjects with tumour expressing PD-L1 (membranous 
staining in 5% and 1% tumor cells) and overall subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy 
The first tumour assessments were conducted 8 weeks after the start of treatment and continued every 
8 weeks thereafter up to 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or treatment 
discontinuation, whichever occurred later. Tumour assessments were continued after treatment 
discontinuation in patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than progression.

DOR and TTR were estimated in subjects with confirmed PR + CR. TTR is defined as the time from first 
dosing date to the date of the first confirmed response (CR or PR), as assessed by the BIRC. DOR is 
defined as the time from first confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented tumour 
progression as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Sample size 
Assuming ORR is 30%, 70 treated subjects with PD-L1 expression 5% would provide 99.1% power at 5% 
type 1 error to reject the null hypothesis of a two-sided test that the true ORR was 10% (single agent 
chemotherapy historical control) a threshold below which was considered not clinical meaningful in this 
population, and 90% power at 5% type I error to reject the null hypothesis of a two-sided test that the 
true ORR was 14.7%. Under the assumption of 32% prevalence rate of PD-L1 5% among all PD-L1 
evaluable subjects, approximately up to 220 PD-L1 evaluable subjects would be treated. Assuming an 
additional 10% of treated subjects with PD-L1 indeterminate status, the total sample size was expected 
to be approximately 242. 
Under the assumption of 50% prevalence rate of PD-L1 1% among all PD-L1 evaluable subjects, 
approximately up to 110 subjects with PD-L1 expression 1% would be treated. This would provide 90% 
power to reject the null hypothesis of ORR = 10% at a two-sided 5% type 1 error if the true ORR in this 
population was 20.6%. 
For all treated subjects, a sample size of 242 would provide 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of 
ORR = 10% at a two-sided 5% type I error if the true ORR in this population was 16.9%. 
The final analysis of the primary endpoint ORR (based on BIRC assessments) was to be performed six 
months after approximately 70 subjects with PD-L1 expression of 5% had been treated (i.e., six months 
after last patient first treatment). 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. PD-L1 results were blinded to the investigator, subject and BMS study 
team. 
Statistical methods 
Unless otherwise noted, discrete variables were tabulated by the frequency and proportion of subjects 
falling into each category, grouped by cohort (with total). Continuous variables were summarised by 
cohort (with total) using the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. ORR 
(both BIRC assessment and investigator-assessed) was summarised by a binomial response rate and its 
corresponding two-sided 95% exact CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method.  BOR was also summarised 
by response category. 
Time to event distributions were estimated using Kaplan Meier techniques. This was done for endpoints 
progression free survival, overall survival, and duration of response (note that time to response was 
analysed using summary statistics such as mean, SD, median, min, max). Median survival time along 
with 95% CI were constructed based on a log-log transformed CI for the survivor function S(t). Rates at 
fixed time points were derived from the Kaplan Meier estimate and corresponding confidence interval 
were derived based on Greenwood formula for variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied 
on the survivor function S(t).

Table 7 Subject Status Summary - All Enrolled and All Treated Subjects (Study CA209275) 
(updated efficacy data, DBL 2 Sept 2016) 
Recruitment 
The enrolment period lasted approximately 8 months (March 2015 to October 2015). The last patient last 
visit date (clinical cut-off) for this analysis was 15-Apr-2016, in order to provide pre-specified minimum 
follow-up of 6 months from the global enrolment last patient first treatment date of 15-Oct-2015. The 
clinical database lock for this analysis occurred on 30-May-2016. 386 subjects were enrolled at 63 sites in 
11 countries. Of the 386 enrolled subjects, 270 (69.9%) were treated with nivolumab; 106 (39.3%) were 
in the US, 23 (8.5%) were in Japan, 135 (50.0%) in Europe, and 6 (2.2%) in Australia. 
Conduct of the study 
The original CA209275 protocol was dated 30-Oct-2014. Four global amendments and 4 country-specific 
amendments were issued for this study. The history of Protocol Amendments is shown in Error!

Relevant Protocol Deviations 
Relevant protocol deviations (significant protocol deviations that were programmable and could 
potentially affect the interpretability of study results) were reported in 3.3% of subjects. The most 
common relevant protocol deviation at study entry (eligibility deviation) was subjects failing to progress 
or recur after prior platinum treatment (1.1%). The most common relevant protocol deviation during the 
treatment period was receipt of concurrent anti-cancer therapy (other than palliative limited field 
radiation therapy or palliative surgical resection), affecting 1.9% of subjects.

Outcomes and estimation 
The efficacy data were provided initially with a minimum follow up of 6 months (Data cutoff 15-Apr-2016; 
DBL 30-May-2016) and were updated during the procedure with an additional 3 months of follow-up 
(minimum follow-up of 8.3 months) (Data cutoff 21 July 2016; DBL 2-Sept-2016). 
•  Primary endpoint (ORR per BIRC) (DBL 30-May-2016) 
Treatment with nivolumab led to an ORR of 19.6% (95% CI: 15.0, 24.9) in all treated subjects, 23.8% 
(95% CI: 16.5, 32.3) in PD-L1 ≥1% cohort, and 28.4% (95% CI: 18.9, 39.5) in PDL1 ≥5% cohort (Table 
15). Six subjects achieved a CR. The ORR was 16.1% (95% CI: 10.5, 23.1) in PD-L1 <1% cohort and 
15.8% (95% CI: 10.8, 21.8) in PD-L1 <5% cohort. 
13 additional subjects had unconfirmed responses (1 CR and 12 PRs) per BIRC. Another 3 subjects with 
confirmed responses of PR had unconfirmed responses of CR.

Median follow-up for OS (time between first dose and last known date alive or death) was 7.00 months 
(range: 0.1 - 13.4 months) among all treated subjects. 
Updated data (DBL 2 Sept 2016) 
In this updated analysis, all 270 treated subjects were analysed for efficacy, including 5 Japanese 
subjects excluded from the primary efficacy analysis due to insufficient follow-up. This update of efficacy 
provides an additional 3 months of follow-up (minimum follow-up of 8.3 months) since the time of the 
primary analysis for study CA209275. 
In the updated analysis, treatment with nivolumab led to an ORR of 20.0% (95% CI: 15.4, 25.3) in all 
treated subjects, 25.0% (95% CI: 17.7, 33.6) in the PD-L1 ≥1 % cohort, and 30.1% (95% CI: 20.5, 
41.2) in the PD-L1 ≥ 5% cohort.  
There were 16 additional deaths at the time of this data cut-off. Among all treated subjects, the updated 
median OS of 8.57 months (95% CI: 6.05, 11.27) was similar to the median OS in the primary analysis 
(8.74 months [95% CI: 6.05, N.A.]).  
More than half (34/54, 63.0%) of the responders had ongoing response at the time of the clinical cut-off 
for this analysis. 
The median DOR was 7.59 months in subjects with PD-L1 expression < 5%, but was not reached in the 
PD-L1 ≥ 1% or PD-L1 ≥ 5% cohorts.

Ancillary analyses 
ORR - Sensitivity analysis 
In one sensitivity analysis, all time point responses contributed to the BOR, regardless of start of 
subsequent therapy (palliative/curative radiotherapy, surgery or systemic therapy). In this analysis, the 
ORR was 20.0% (95% CI: 15.4, 25.3) in all treated subjects, 24.6% (95% CI: 17.2, 33.2) in PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
cohort, and 29.6% (95% CI: 20.0, 40.8) in PD-L1 ≥ 5% cohort. In the other sensitivity analysis, subjects 
who progressed within 1 month of start of treatment due to new brain lesion without evidence of baseline 
brain lesion (most subjects did not get baseline brain MRI as it was only required if there was a history of 
brain metastases), were excluded. In this analysis, the ORR was 19.9% (95% CI: 15.3, 25.3) in all 
treated subjects, 23.8% (95% CI: 16.5, 32.3) in PD-L1 ≥ 1% cohort and 28.4% (95% CI: 18.9, 39.5) in 
PD-L1 ≥ 5% cohort. 
PFS - Sensitivity analysis 
In one sensitivity analysis, tumour assessments, progression or death that occurred after anti-cancer 
therapy (palliative/curative radiotherapy, surgery or systemic therapy) were taken into account. In this 
analysis, the median PFS was 2.00 months in all treated subjects, 3.52 months in PD-L1 ≥ 1% cohort, and 
3.71 months in PD-L1 ≥ 5% cohort. 
In the other sensitivity analysis, subjects who progressed within 1 month of start of treatment due to new 
brain lesion, without evidence of baseline brain lesion (most subjects did not get baseline brain MRI as it 
was only required if there was a history of brain metastases), were excluded. In this analysis, the median 
PFS was 2.04 months in all treated subjects, 3.55 months in PD-L1 ≥ 1% cohort, and 3.71 months in PD-
L1 ≥ 5% cohort 
The median PFS per investigator was 2.10 months (95% CI: 1.87, 2.83) in all treated subjects, 3.65 
months (95% CI: 1.94, 5.32) in PD-L1 ≥ 1% cohort, and 3.71 months (95% CI: 1.87, 5.72)in PD-L1 ≥ 5% 
cohort. The median PFS per investigator was 1.94 months (95% CI: 1.81, 2.33) in PD-L1 < 1% cohort, 
and 2.00 months (95% CI: 1.87, 2.37) in PD-L1 < 5% cohort. 
Subjects treated beyond investigator-assessed progression 
A total of 26.4% (70/265) of treated subjects received at least one dose after initial RECIST v1.1-defined 
progression. Treatment beyond progression was defined as a last dosing date after a RECIST v1.1-defined 
progression date. Of the 70 subjects treated beyond progression, 24 were considered non-conventional 
benefiters, defined as subjects who had not experienced a BOR of PR/CR prior to initial RECIST v1.1-
defined progression.

Time to and Duration of Response (TTR and DOR) per BIRC 
TTR and DOR were estimated in subjects with confirmed PR + CR and shown in Table 19.  
The median DOR per BIRC was not reached in all treated subjects; the median DOR was 7.52 months in 
subjects with PD-L1 expression < 5% but was not reached in the remaining 3 PD-L1 cohorts. Most 
(40/52, 76.9%) of the responders were still continuing in response at the time of database lock, with 
nearly all (96.2%) having a DOR of at least 3 months. Ongoing response includes responders who had 
neither progressed nor initiated subsequent therapy at the time of analysis, and excluded responders 
censored prior to 12 weeks of the clinical data cutoff date.

Concordance between BIRC and investigator assessments 
The concordance rate of responders between IRRC and investigator assessments was 92.8%. 
Concordance rates were similar observed for all 4 PD-L1 cohorts (88.9% - 95.8%), as shown in Table 20

Overall Survival and subsequent cancer therapy 
Subsequent cancer therapy was received by 19.6% of all treated subjects. Subsequent systemic therapy 
was received by 9.8% of subjects; the most common was gemcitabine (3.8%), followed by carboplatin, 
cisplatin, and paclitaxel (1.9% each).

Updated analysis (DBL 02-Sep-2016) 
As of database lock on 02-Sep-2016, 54 (20%) subjects received subsequent therapy with 28 (10.4%) 
receiving systemic anticancer therapy, most of which was chemotherapy, and 25 (9.3%) receiving 
radiation therapy, most of which was palliative. The median time for starting subsequent therapy was 
3.98 months (range 0.5, 11.1).  
Median overall survival (mOS) in subjects not receiving subsequent therapy (N=216) was 6.47 (95% CI: 
4.76, 9.99) months, lower than in the all treated population (mOS 8.57 [95% CI: 6.05, 11.27]). Despite 
the lower mOS in patients not receiving subsequent therapy in CA209275, the 1-year OS rate of 41% 
(95% CI: 34.3, 47.6) was similar to the 1-year OS rate in the all treated population of 41% (95% CI: 
34.8, 47.1).

The protocol defines two PD-L1 expression cutoffs (1% and 5%).  
Ad-hoc exploratory analyses were performed to further explore the effect of baseline PD-L1 expression on 
confirmed response per BIRC as continuous variable from 0% to 100%. The receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) curve based on response showed that there was no optimal cutoff for PD-L1 
expression. The logistic regression model with response and PD-L1 expression was consistent with 
previous observations, i.e. the predicted probability of response was clinically meaningful across the 
range of PD-L1 expression value.

Study CA209032 
A Phase 1/2, Open-label Study of Nivolumab Monotherapy or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab in 
Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors 
CA209032 is a multicenter Phase 1/2, open label, randomised study of nivolumab monotherapy or 
nivolumab combined with ipilimumab designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab as 
monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab in subjects with 6 different tumour types including UC. 
Subjects with UC originating in the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder or urethra with tumour progression or 
refractory disease and at least 1 platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen unless the subject actively 
refused chemotherapy were treated with one of following 3 regimens: nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg, 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, and nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg.

Figure 12 Design Schematic for Urothelial Carcinoma Cohort (study CA209032) 
Treated subjects were evaluated for response according to RECIST v1.1 at baseline and then at 6 weeks 
after first dose and continuing every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks until 
disease progression (investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1-defined progression) or treatment 
discontinuation, whichever occurred later. Subjects were treated until progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
or other protocol-defined reasons. Treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1-defined 
progression was permitted if the subject had an investigator-assessed clinical benefit and was tolerating 
study drug. 
Subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy who had a confirmed progression were subsequently 
allowed to cross over to nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination. 
The clinical data base lock for this analysis occurred on 24-Mar-2016. 
Pre-treatment tumour tissue (archival or fresh biopsy specimen) was systematically collected in order to 
conduct pre planned analyses of efficacy according to baseline PD-L1 expression status. Subjects were 
treated, regardless of baseline tumour PD-L1 expression status. Archived tissue could be from prior 
biopsy of unresectable or metastatic disease or from prior surgical resection. Database lock was 24-Mar-
2016. 
•  Sample Size and Power 
An ORR of 10% or less was considered not of clinical value, and an ORR of 25% or greater was 
considered of strong clinical interest. The sample size 60 - 105 provided 90% to 97% power to reject the 
null hypothesis of 10% response rate if the true response rate was 25% with a two-sided Type I error 
rate of 5%. 
• 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary endpoint for the nivolumab monotherapy treated UC cohort was to assess the investigator-
assessed ORR. The ORR was defined as the proportion of treated subjects with a confirmed BOR of CR or 
PR according to RECIST 1.1. 
Additional efficacy assessments included investigator-assessed DOR and PFS according to RECIST v1.1; 
OS; association between tumour PD-L1 expression and efficacy; HRQoL as assessed by the EQ-5D.

Table 30 Baseline Disease Characteristics and Tumor Assessments – All Nivolumab 
Monotherapy Treated Urothelial Carcinoma Subjects (study CA209032) 
Most (84.6%) subjects received prior systemic cancer treatments in the metastatic setting. Percentages 
of subjects receiving prior systemic cancer treatments in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings were 
17.9% and 42.3%, respectively. Nearly all (96.2%) subjects received prior platinum-containing therapy 
in any setting with the majority (75.6%) receiving the therapy in the metastatic setting. The most 
frequent prior platinum-containing therapy was cisplatin followed by carboplatin. Prior platinum-
containing therapy was associated with recurrence/progression in 92.3% of the subjects. Nearly all 
subjects progressed within 12 months of their most recent platinum regimen, with nearly two-thirds 
(59.7%) progressing within 3 months. 
•  Results 
The enrollment period for nivolumab monotherapy UC cohort lasted approximately 11 months (June 2014 
to May-2015). The last patient’s first treatment date was 08-May-2015, and the last patient last visit date 
(clinical cut-off) was 11-Feb-2016, providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 9 months. The 
clinical data base lock occurred on 24-Mar-2016. 86 subjects with advanced or metastatic UC were 
enrolled in the nivolumab monotherapy treatment arm at 16 sites in 5 countries. Across the 16 sites, 78 
(90.7%) of these enrolled subjects were treated with nivolumab monotherapy. Among these treated 
subjects, 19 (24.4%) were in Europe (Finland, Germany, Spain, and United Kingdom), and 59 (75.6%) 
were in the US. 
76.9% of all treated subjects were no longer continuing in the treatment period (Table 31). The primary 
reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression. 18 (23.1%) subjects crossed from 
nivolumab monotherapy over to nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combination regimen, of 
whom 15 (83.3%) were no longer continuing in the treatment period; the primary reason for treatment 
discontinuation was disease progression.

A pre-specified sensitivity analysis was performed for PFS in which there was no censoring for systemic 
anti-cancer therapy prior to a progression event. The results of this sensitivity analysis (median PFS: 2.76 
[95% CI: 1.45, 5.52] months) were consistent with the PFS analysis using the primary definition. 
As highlighted in the Kaplan-Meier plot in  
Figure 14, The median OS was 9.72 months and the OS rates (95% CI) were 78.2% (67.3, 85.8) at 3 
months, 69.2% (57.7, 78.2) at 6 months, and 45.6% (34.2, 56.3) at 12 months.

An ad-hoc sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of planed treatment crossover on OS was conducted 
using Kaplan-Meier method. The 18 subjects who received planned crossover treatment with nivolumab + 
ipilimumab combination were separated from the remaining subjects who did not receive planned 
crossover treatment in the OS analyses. In subjects who did not receive planned crossover treatment, the 
median OS was 7.89 months (95% CI: 5.29, 16.16); the OS rate (95% CI) was 61.7% (48.2, 72.6) at 6 
months and 43.3% (30.6, 55.3) at 12 months.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application in bladder cancer is based on two ongoing clinical studies: one pivotal Phase 2 study in 
metastatic or unresectable urothelial cancer (CA209275) and one supportive Phase 1/2 study in multiple 
tumour types, including unresectable locally advanced or metastatic UC (CA209032), both conducted in 
patients who has progressed on or after to at least 1 platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.  
Both studies are single arm trials hampering any discussion about relative efficacy of nivolumab versus 
chemotherapy. Previously reported data on therapy for relapse in metastatic and advanced UC are highly 
variable with results being vastly dependent on patient selection; therefore there is a risk that the 
outcomes of these two studies are overestimated (see discussion on efficacy data).  
Patients intended to be recruited, according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, were subjects with 
histological or cytological evidence of metastatic or surgically unresectable urothelial carcinoma 
originating in the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis. They must have progression or recurrence after 
treatment with at least 1 platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or surgically-
unresectable locally advanced urothelial cancer, or within 12 months of peri-operative (neo-adjuvant or 
adjuvant) treatment with a platinum- containing chemotherapy in the setting of cystectomy for localised 
muscle- invasive UC. These inclusion criteria can be considered representative of the claimed indication, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/392346/2017 
Page 57/106 
 
  
  
 
 
i.e. patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of 
prior platinum- containing therapy. 
The primary endpoint for both studies was confirmed ORR (BICR assessment and investigator assessment 
in CA209275 and CA209032 respectively). TTR, DoR, PFS and OS were secondary endpoints. The use of 
ORR as primary endpoint is acceptable for phase I/II studies, although cannot be used on its own to 
demonstrate the clinical benefit to patients. Long term clinical outcomes like PFS and OS have been 
provided as secondary endpoints, which are considered appropriate in such trial designs. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the Study CA209275, 386 subjects were enrolled at 63 sites in 11 countries. Of them 265 were 
considered the efficacy population, given the requirement of a minimum follow up of 6 months from the 
global enrolment last patient first treatment date. The main reason for not treating patients was that 
subject no longer met the inclusion criteria. Patients included were mainly white (85.6%) and male 
population (78.1%) with urinary bladder as tumour type (73%). Only 3.3% were locally unresectable. 
Almost 28% of patients had liver metastasis and 84% with visceral metastases. There were no patients 
but one with CNS metastases. Regarding the previous treatment received, 71.5% had received previous 
treatment in the metastatic setting. All patients had received platinum treatment, with almost 66% of 
patients with the most recent platinum regimen in the metastatic setting. Of note, 59% of patients 
progressed in less than 3 months from the last platinum treatment. Subjects with ECOG >1 were not 
included (except for 1 protocol deviation). Results from these patients can not necessarily be extrapolated 
to patients who have a ECOG performance status of 2 or higher, which comprise almost 40-50% of the 
advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.  
Most baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between PD-L1 cohorts, except for 
the distribution of baseline poor prognostic factors, most apparent when using the 1% cut-off for PD-L1 
expression. 
Overall, the patients recruited in study CA209275 seem to have a poor prognosis, especially when 
considering the percentage of patients with visceral metastasis and the treatment free interval. Study 
CA209032 reveals a similar population in regard to baseline characteristics, though with a smaller number 
of treated patients (78). 
At the time of initial submission, outcomes from the pivotal trial (study CA209275) in terms of ORR by 
BICR showed a response rate of 19.6% in all treated patients (23% by investigator assessment), with a 
median of duration of response not reached yet but with the lower bound of 7.43 months (77% of 
patients were in response at the database lock) and with a time to objective response of around 2 
months. This antitumor activity could be translated into a life expectancy of 8-9 months in terms of 
median, even though the percentage of events was 51%. Two pre-specified sensitivity analyses were 
performed for BIRC-assessed BOR and the results of these analyses were consistent with those of the 
primary analysis. 
Median PFS was around 2 months with 76% of events. These results are supported by those from the 
study CA209032, where the ORR were 24% (investigator assessment) and similar PFS and OS results 
were achieved (median PFS 2.78 months and 9.72 months of OS).  
Updated efficacy data submitted during the review, from study CA209275 with a clinical cut-off of 21 July 
2016, showed similar results: ORR of 20.0% (95% CI: 15.4, 25.3) in all treated subjects and a median 
OS  of  8.57  months  (95%  CI:  6.05,  11.27).  The  median  DOR  per  BIRC  was  10.35  months  in  all  treated 
subjects;  however  this  seemed  to  be  reflective  of  1  subject  experiencing  a  late  event  and  which  may 
change with longer follow-up. More than half (34/54, 63.0%) of the responders had ongoing response at 
the time of the clinical cut-off for this analysis.

Twenty  percent  of  the  subject  received  subsequent  cancer  therapies  in  the  pivotal  trial  and  30%  of 
patients  in  the  study  CA209032.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  potential  impact  of  post-
progression  therapies  on  OS.  The  use  of  subsequent  therapies  seemed  to  have  an  important  impact  on 
the  OS  data.  Despite  only  54  (20%)  subjects  received  subsequent  therapy  with  28  (10.4%)  receiving 
systemic  anticancer  therapy,  when  these  patients  were  excluded  from  the  analysis,  the  median  OS 
decreased  to  6.47  (95%  CI:  4.76,  9.99)  months  from  the  8.57  months  in  whole  population  (95%  CI: 
6.05,  11.27).  On  the  other  hand,  this  decrease  in  the  median  did  not  have  a  great  impact  in  the  long 
term survival, since the 1-year survival rate appeared to be identical. Similar conclusions were observed 
in  the  study  CA209032.  In  any  case,  the  OS  data  in  whole  population  and  especially  in  PD-L1>1% 
patients,  appeared  overall  superior  to  those  described  with  chemotherapy,  with  higher  survival  rates  at 
12  months.  However,  in  the  PD-L1<1%  subgroup,  when  only  subjects  without  subsequent  anticancer 
therapy were analysed, the 12-month survival rate decreased to 33.5%, which appeared similar to those 
described in larger trials with single-agent chemotherapy (25%-30%). The lack of comparator hampered 
further discussion on this issue.  
As expected, results in those subgroups of patients with poorer prognosis (visceral and hepatic 
metastasis, high ECOG) obtained lower ORR. Of note, the response rate according to the different age 
groups showed that older subgroups had better results. 
In the pivotal study, similar PFS and OS results were observed for subgroups with different numbers of 
prior regimens in the metastatic setting. Patients with a shorter time from the most recent prior regimen, 
which could represent those who have experienced rapidly progressing disease, had worse OS and ORR 
results than patients with longer time since prior treatment, who may have had more indolent disease. 
The median TTR was 1.87 months. It is possible that patients with rapidly progressing tumours have 
insufficient time to experience benefit from treatment with nivolumab. Nevertheless, the nivolumab 
treated group seems to experience a better response than what is expected for chemotherapy and in the 
subgroup designated as PD-L1<1%, the responses are considered superior to the standard of care. 
Therefore, while it is possible that patients may experience a delay in the onset of response to nivolumab 
as observed in other indications, because of the lack of a control arm it is not possible to elucidate 
whether the survival curve of nivolumab would be below chemotherapy at the beginning of the treatment.  
The design of the studies as single arm trials is considered an important drawback as it hampers the 
interpretation of the results in a heterogeneous patient population. According to the bibliography in 
metastatic bladder cancer, the therapeutic landscape after a first treatment of platinum (vinflunine, 
taxanes, gemcitabine and pemetrexed) offers ORRs in monotherapy that range between 10-15% with a 
median OS of 7-9 months, with the exception of gemcitabine that as single agent has demonstrated ORRs 
of 11-29%, with median OS that ranged from 5 to 13 months, as second-line therapy in small Phase 2 
studies (N<50)8,9,10,11. With taxane-based combination chemotherapies, ORRs increase up to 30-70%, 
with 11-13 months of OS, however these regimens are not frequently used due to their toxicity12.  
In  both  studies  CA209275  and  CA209032,  in  the  subset  of  patients  with  high  tumour  PD-L1  expression 
i.e.  >1%,  treatment  with  nivolumab  showed  consistently  higher  rates  of  tumour  responses  (over  24%) 
and  a  trend  for  higher  OS  when  compared  to  what  has  been  reported  in  the  literature.  These  results

support  a  trend  for  a  greater  benefit  in  patients  that  have  tumours  that  express  PD-L1.  Similar  results 
were  provided  by  the  study  CA209032.  These  promising  results  in  patients  with  high  tumour  PD-L1 
expression  are  very  much  in  line  with  those  reported  for  other  immunotherapeutic  medicinal  products 
with a similar mechanism of action and add further to the biological plausibility to the observed results.  
In  the  pivotal  study  CA209275,  patients  with  tumour  PD-L1  expression≥1%  and  5%  obtained  ORRs  of 
25% and 30% respectively, while patients with tumour PD-L1 expression<1% had an ORR of 16%. Both 
PFS  and  OS  were  longer  for  patients  with  high  tumour  PD-L1  expression  (median  OS  11.6  and  12.9 
months in PD-L1 ≥1% and PD-L1 ≥5% respectively vs. 6 months in PD-L1 <1% and PD-L1 <5%; median 
PFS 3.55 months in PD-L1 ≥1% and 3.71 months in PD-L1 ≥5% and 1.9 months in PD-L1 <1% and PD-
L1  <5%).  The  largest  baseline  differences  between  the  two  PD-L1  subgroups  (<1%  and  >1%) 
encompassed  smoking  status  and  Bellmunt  Risk  Factors.  The  percentage  of  never  smokers  was  10% 
higher  in  the  PD-L1<1%  (29.5  vs  19.4%).  On  the  other  hand,  there  were  more  patients  with  2-3 
Bellmunt  Risk  Factors  in  the  PD-L1<1%  than  in  the  >1%  subgroup  (28%  vs.  16.1%).  To  what  extent 
these imbalances influenced the results is not totally clear. Among the rest of baseline characteristics, the 
differences were judged as not to have strongly impacted on the survival. It was notable that for patients 
with tumour PD-L1<1% a shorter median OS was observed in the vast majority of subsets, in particular 
for patients with poor prognostic factors. 
In  the  supportive  study  CA209032,  ORR  did  not  seem  to  be  affected  by  tumour  PD-L1  expression,  with 
ORR of 24% and 26% for patients with above 1% expression and below 1% expression, respectively. Of 
importance  is  that  durable  responses  were  observed  across  all  PD-L1  subgroups.  The  duration  of 
response  (DoR)  reached  with  nivolumab  appeared  better  than  DoRs  described  for  all  other  available 
therapies  (including  combination-chemotherapy),  even  in  the  subgroups  with  PD-L1  expression  below 
1%. Therefore, while the response rates achieved with nivolumab in subgroups with PD-L1<1% were not 
very high, the responses were durable which is considered clinically relevant. 
Whilst  the  median  of  OS  with  nivolumab  in  patients  with  PD-L1  <1%  and  with  presence  of  2  Bellmunt 
factors  was  3.15  months,  the  OS  rates  at  1  year  was  13.4%  (Table  23)  which  appear  to  be  similar  to 
chemotherapy  (i.e.  <10%)13.  The  1  year  survival  rate  in  the  overall  population  of  patients  PD-L1<1% 
provided  similar  results  to  chemotherapy  (i.e.  34%  reported  with  nivolumab  in  study  CA209275  (Table 
18)  versus  31%  reported  with  chemotherapy  in  study  KEYNOTE-45)14  and  the  1-year  survival  rate  in 
those  patients  in  response,  was  close  to  96%,  which  is  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Therefore,  it  is 
considered reasonable to assume that the use of nivolumab, also in patients with PD-L1 <1% for second 
line treatment of UC, will provide comparable rates of response to chemotherapy. Also, these responses 
are more durable than achieved with any other therapy, and the survival benefit is very much in line to 
that reported for chemotherapy. 
The SmPC has been updated to reflect that results from post-hoc, exploratory analyses indicate that in 
patients with low (e.g. <5%) to no tumour PD-L1 expression, other patient characteristics (e.g. liver 
metastases, visceral metastases, baseline haemoglobin <10g/dL and ECOG performance status = 1) 
might contribute to the clinical outcome (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The ROC curve based on response showed that there was no optimal cut-off for PD-L1 expression. 
Additional analyses requested by the CHMP showed that some biomarkers analysed were not predictive of 
response of nivolumab, being Interferon-gamma gene (RNA) expression signature using the provided 
assay, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs; % of CD14+LIN-) abundance, percentage of CD8+ T 
cells infiltrate in tumour and the ratio of CD8+ T cells to FOXP3+ cells (T regulatory cells). No firm 
conclusions could be drawn regarding PD-L2 tumour expression, due to the low number of tumour cells 
expressing PD-L2. The combination of PD-L1 expression on immune cells and PD-L1 on tumour cells

might be helpful in identifying which patients have limited chance of responding to therapy (Table 27). 
Few responders to nivolumab (RR 7-8%) were observed among patients with both no/rare PD-L1 
expression on immune cells and PD-L1<1% or <5% expression on tumour cells, however no quantitative 
method was used as currently no validated assays and methods exists. Therefore, PD-L1 expression on 
both immune cells and tumour cells should be assessed in predicting treatment response and survival in a 
prospective manner and using validated assays and methods where possible. Other biomarkers such as 
other gene signatures, mutational load, PD-L1 and PD-L2 on mRNA remain to be evaluated, however, 
tissue inventory limitations have to be taken into account. Annex II has been updated accordingly. In 
particular the MAH will further explore in UC patients the early identification of those who do/do not 
respond to treatment with nivolumab, as well as evaluate the association between improved clinical 
outcomes to nivolumab and the presence of mutational and neoantigen load and of PD -L1 expression on 
tumour- and tumour associated immune cells using validated approaches as feasible. These biomarker 
assessments will be exploratory for study CA209275, however they should be prospectively assessed in 
future UC studies with nivolumab. 
Furthermore,  in  melanoma  a  high  level  of  LDH  seems  to  be  a  predictor  of  low  nivolumab  benefit. 
Unfortunately, very few UC patients (3.7%) had a baseline LDH of > 2*ULN, so no firm conclusions can 
be  drawn  from  the  2*ULN  cut-off.  Though  there  are  differences  observed  in  efficacy  outcomes  between 
those with elevated LDH and those with normal LDH levels, there are still responders among patients with 
elevated LDH level and thus this cannot be used to exclude patients from treatment. When combined with 
subgroups  stratified  for  PD-L1  expression,  the  LDH  level  provides  no  additional  value  for  treatment 
selection.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Nivolumab has shown a clinically meaningful result in terms of ORR and OS in two single arm trials.  In 
patients with PD-L1 expression below 1%, response rates and OS were very much in line to those 
expected from chemotherapy, also the responses were more durable than achieved with current standard 
of care.  
No useful clinical risk factor or biomarker predictive of treatment response was identified. Based on the 
above, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (Annex 
II condition):  
The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab therapy should be further explored in 
patients with urothelial carcinoma: 
• 
To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell 
membrane level by IHC (e.g., other genomic-based methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, 
that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, 
PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, 
expression of components of antigen-presentation complexes and/or other inhibitory checkpoint 
receptors/ligands within tumour, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be provided 
for urothelial carcinoma studies CA209275 and CA209032: by 30 June 2018 
• 
To further explore in UC patients the early identification of those who do/do  not respond to 
treatment with nivolumab, as well as to evaluate the association between improved clinical 
outcomes to nivolumab and the presence of: 
o  Mutational and neoantigen load, and PD -L1 expression on tumour- and tumour 
associated immune cells using validated approaches as feasible: by 30 June 2018

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH provided a summary of clinical safety (SCS) that was an integrated view of the safety data from 
the  nivolumab  clinical  development  program  supporting  the  recommended  dose  schedule  for  nivolumab 
monotherapy  (3  mg/kg  IV  Q2W)  and  the  labelling  information  for  an  indication  in  subjects  with  locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  (UC)  who  have  disease  progression  during  or  following  a 
platinum-containing  chemotherapy  or  within  12  months  of  neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant  treatment  with  a 
platinum-containing therapy. 
It included safety and tolerability data from 1 Phase 2 study, CA209275: a single arm study of nivolumab 
(270  treated  subjects)  in  subjects  with  metastatic  or  surgically  unresectable  urothelial  carcinoma  who 
have  progressed  or  recurred  following treatment  with  a  platinum  agent  and  the  1  supportive  Phase  1/2 
study,  CA209032,  an  open-label  study  of  nivolumab  monotherapy  or  nivolumab  combined  with 
ipilimumab  in  subjects  with  advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumors  (78  treated  subjects  in  nivolumab 
monotherapy  UC  cohort).  A  final  CSR  for  CA209275  based  on  the  30-May-2016  database  lock  and  an 
interim CSR for CA209032 based on the 24-Mar-2016 database lock. 
Integrated  safety  data  were  presented  for  348  UC  subjects  from  CA209275  and  CA209032  (nivolumab 
monotherapy UC cohort), hereafter referred to as the ‘Integrated UC Population’. Both studies included a 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen and the same method of safety data collection. The Integrated 
UC Population was the population for presentation of safety of nivolumab monotherapy in UC.

Patient exposure 
The  nivolumab  monotherapy  UC  safety  data  from  studies  CA209275  and  CA209032  were  pooled  for  the 
SCS since both studies used the same dosing schedule and the study populations were comparable. The 
populations  are  not  comparable  enough  for  pooling  of  efficacy  due  to  differences  in  line  of  therapy. 
CA209275 and CA209032 are the only studies in which patients with metastatic or surgically unresectable 
UC  have  been  treated  with  nivolumab  in  accordance  with  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation 
(ICH) guidance provided in the M4E(R1). 
The Study CA209275 is a single arm, open-label Phase 2 trial. Safety analyses were conducted in all 270 
subjects  with  metastatic  or  surgically  unresectable  UC  who  have  progressed  or  recurred  following 
treatment with a platinum agent. At the time of database lock, 270 subjects were treated with nivolumab 
monotherapy. Safety analyses were conducted in all 270 treated subjects who received at least one dose 
of  study  drug.  Study  CA209032  was  a  multicenter,  open-label,  Phase  1/2  study,  only  data  from  the 
nivolumab  monotherapy  UC  cohort  is  included  in  the  safety  analysis.  At  the  time  of  database  lock,  78 
subjects  were  treated  with  nivolumab  monotherapy.  Safety  analyses  were  conducted  in  all  78  treated 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Both studies included a nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W 
dosing regimen and the same method of safety data collection. 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population  (Table  40)  the  majority  of  subjects  (80.2%)  received  ≥  90%  of  the 
planned  nivolumab  dose  intensity,  the  median  number  of  nivolumab  doses  received  was  7.0  and  the 
median duration of therapy was 3.25 months with 52.6%, 33.3%, 15.8%, and 5.2% of subjects treated 
for more than 3, 6, 9, or 12 months, respectively.

Compared  with  CA209275  and  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  subjects  in  CA209032  received  a  slightly 
higher  median  cumulative  dose  of  nivolumab  as  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  were  treated  for  more 
than 9 and 12 months.

Adverse events 
Common AEs 
In the Integrated UC Population, the frequency, type, and severity of all-causality AEs (any grade and 
Grade 3-4) reported in subjects treated with nivolumab were consistent with the known safety profile of 
nivolumab. 
In the Integrated UC Population, drug-related AEs consisted mainly of events in the general disorders and 
administration site conditions, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and GI disorders SOCs. 
Adverse Events (Regardless of Causality) 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  any-grade  AEs  (regardless  of  causality)  were  reported  in  99.1%  of 
subjects  treated  with  nivolumab  (Table  41).  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were:  fatigue  (37.1%), 
nausea (23.9%), anaemia (20.1%), decreased appetite (20.1%), and cough (17.8%). 
In  the  Integrated  UC  population,  Grade  3-4  AEs  (regardless  of  causality)  were  reported  in  51.7%  of 
subjects  (Table  41).The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-4  AEs  were  anaemia  (6.9%),  urinary  tract 
infection  (5.7%),  malignant  neoplasm  progression  (4.3%),  dyspnoea  (3.7%),  asthenia  (3.2%),  and

Drug-related AEs 
In the Integrated UC Population, any-grade drug-related AEs were reported in 68.7% of subjects (Table 
44).The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs  were  fatigue  (21.0%),  pruritus  (13.8%),  diarrhoea 
(8.9%), nausea (8.3%), and decreased appetite (7.8%) 
In the Integrated UC Population, Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 19.0% of subjects (Table 
44).The  most  frequently  reported  Grade 3-4  drug-related  AEs  were  lipase increased  (2.3%)  and  fatigue 
(2.0%).  
Table  44  Drug-related  AEs  by  Worst  CTC  Grade  Reported  in  ≥  5%  of  Treated  Subjects -  
CA209275 and Integrated UC Population 
The biggest difference in AE rates between the 2 studies (CA209275 and CA209032), is in the any grade 
drug-related  AEs  category:  83.3%  any  grade  drug-related  AEs  were  noted  in  all  treated  subjects  in 
CA209032 as compared to 64.4% in CA209275. In all other categories of safety variables assessed, the 
rates noted were mostly similar between the 2 studies or there was a ≤ 5.5% difference between the 2 
studies with no consistent pattern of increase noted specific to CA209032. Drug-related SAEs (any grade 
and  Grade  3-4)  were  similar  between  both  studies,  as  were  drug-related  Grade  3-4  drug-related 
discontinuation rates.

Study  drug-related  death  rate  was  higher  in  CA209032  (2.6%)  vs.  CA209275  (1.1%).  When  incidence 
rates  were  exposure-adjusted,  the  AE  rates  were  similar  between  CA209032,  CA209275,  and  the 
Integrated  UC  Population  (2355.4,  2184.9,  and  2234.2  [respectively]  incidence  rate  per  100  person 
years) (5% cut-off).  
Late-Emergent AEs 
Late-emergent  drug-related  AEs  were  defined  as  drug-related  AEs  with  an  onset  date  >  100  days  after 
the  last  dose  of  study  therapy.  No  late-emergent  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  for  study  CA209032. 
One  subject  (0.4%)  in  CA209275  experienced  a  Grade  3  late  emergent  drug-related  AE  of  organizing 
pneumonia.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event (SAEs) 
SAEs  consisted  mainly  of  events  in  the  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified  (incl  cysts  and 
polyps), infections and infestations, and gastrointestinal disorders SOCs in the Integrated UC Population. 
Drug-related  SAEs  consisted  mainly  of  events  in  the  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  respiratory,  thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders SOCs in the Integrated UC Population. 
In the Integrated UC Population, SAEs were reported in 52.6% of subjects (Table 46), 54.4% of subjects 
in Study CA209275 and 46.2% of subjects in Study CA209032. In the Integrated UC Population Grade 3-
4  SAEs  were  reported  in  35.1%  of  subjects  and  the  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  malignant 
neoplasm  progression  (11.5%),  urinary  tract  infection  (5.2%),  general  physical  health  deterioration 
(2.6%),  sepsis  (2.3%),  and  diarrhoea  and  small  intestinal  obstruction  (2.0%).  The  most  frequently 
reported  SAEs  were  in  Study  CA209032  and  Study  CA209275  respectively:  malignant  neoplasm  (9.0% 
vs. 12.2%) and urinary tract infection (3.8% vs. 5.6%).  
The frequencies of SAEs (any Grade, and Grade 3-4) in treated subjects in the CA209275 and CA209032 
populations were similar for Grade 3-4 events to the Integrated UC Population. Grade 5 SAEs occurred at 
higher  frequencies  in  the  CA209275  treated  population  (11.5%)  compared  to  the  Integrated  UC 
Population (10.9%) and CA209032 (9.0%). 
In the Integrated UC Population, drug-related SAEs were reported in 9.5% of subjects (Table 47). Grade 
3-4  drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  6.6%  of  subjects.  Drug-related  SAEs  reported  in  at  least  2 
subjects  were  pneumonitis  and  diarrhoea,  5  (1.4%)  each;  fatigue,  3  (0.9%);  colitis,  nausea,  and 
pemphigoid, 2 (0.6%) subjects each. 
The  frequencies  of  drug-related  SAEs  (any  grade,  Grade  3-4,  and  Grade  5)  in  treated  subjects  in 
theCA209275 and CA209032 populations were consistent with the Integrated UC Population.

Deaths 
As  of  the  30-May-2016  and  24-Mar-2016  database  locks  for  CA209275  and  CA209032,  respectively,  a 
similar proportion of subjects died in each study (Table 48). Disease progression was the most common 
cause  of  death  for  both  studies,  including  deaths  occurring  within  30  days  of  last  dose  and  deaths 
occurring within 100 days of last dose. A higher proportion of subjects died within 30 days of last dose in 
CA209275 than in CA209032.

Table 48 Summary of Deaths - All Treated Subjects 
Deaths Attributed to Study Drug Toxicity 
6 (1.7%) deaths assessed by the investigator due to study drug toxicity.  
There  were  3  deaths  in  CA209275  due  to  study  drug  toxicity  as  assessed  by  the  investigator 
(pneumonitis,  respiratory  failure  (preceded  by  interstitial  lung  disease)-  and  cardiovascular  failure-).  In 
addition,  in  one  subject,  although  pneumonitis  was  considered  related  to  nivolumab,  the  investigator 
deemed immediate cause of death to be due to multifactorial acute respiratory failure unrelated to study 
drug.  However,  this  death  was  assessed  as  related  by  BMS  medical  surveillance  team,  due  to  the 
consideration that the immunomodulatory nature of nivolumab led to the development of pneumonitis in 
the first instance, causing acute respiratory failure with fatal outcome. 
In  study  CA209032,  one  subject  died  due  to  pneumonitis.  The  patient  had  a  metastatic  spread  of  the 
tumour  in  the  lung  at  baseline.  Although  other  contributing  factors  such  as  lung  metastases  and 
concomitant  lung  infections  could  not  be  excluded,  a  causal  association  between  study  therapy  and 
pneumonitis  was  considered  possible.  The  fatal  outcome  was  likely  attributable  to  multiple  factors, 
including underlying malignancy and the possible lung infection. In addition, 1 subject had a drug-related 
event post database lock, died due to thrombocytopenia. This subject’s death was initially attributed to a 
reason  of  ‘Other,’  verbatim  terms  for  which  was  reported  as  ‘thrombocytopenia  of  unknown  cause, 
metastatic  bladder  cancer’.  The  cause  of  subject’s  death  was  subsequently  updated  to  drug-related 
thrombocytopenia.  Considering  that  available  information  was  not  suggestive  of  other  alternative 
aetiologies, a causal association between study therapy and thrombocytopenia was considered possible.

Deaths Attributed to Other Reasons 
The following 14 cases were reported: hepatic failure due to disease under study; perforated bowel with 
subsequent respiratory failure with sepsis likely; cardiac arrest in basic disease; Grade 5 cardiopulmonary 
arrest;  cardiac  arrest;  hepatic  failure;  small  bowel  obstruction  (disease  progression)  resulted  in  subject 
death;  acute  respiratory  failure;  bowel  perforation;  brain  stroke;  sepsis,  bradycardia,  hypotension; 
respiratory distress-possible PE; bowel obstruction; liver disorder. 
One death was attributed to a reason of ‘Other’. The verbatim term for this reason was reported as sepsis 
that was not considered related to study drug by the investigator. The subject died 59 days after the last 
dose of nivolumab. 
Select adverse events / adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Select  AEs  were  AEs  of  special  clinical  interest  meeting  defined  criteria  and  multiple  event  terms  that 
were grouped into select AE categories (regardless of treatment with immune modulating medication).  
Based  on  defined  guiding  principles  and  taking  into  account  the  types  of  AEs  already  observed  across 
studies of nivolumab monotherapy, endocrinopathies, diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, interstitial 
nephritis,  and  rash  are  currently  considered  to  be  select  AEs.  Hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were 
analyzed along with the select AE categories because multiple event terms may be used to describe such 
events  and  pooling  of  terms  was  therefore  necessary  for  full  characterization.  Hypersensitivity/infusion 
reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered select AEs. 
Other  events  of  special  interest  (OESIs)  are  events  that  do  not  fulfil  all  criteria  to qualify  as  select  AEs. 
These  events  may  differ 
from 
those  caused  by  non-immunotherapies  and  may 
require 
immunosuppression  as  part  of  their  management.  Analyses  of  OESIs  had  extended  follow-up(100-day 
window).OESIs  included  the  following  categories:  demyelination,  encephalitis,  Guillain-Barre  syndrome, 
myasthenic  syndrome,  pancreatitis,  and  uveitis.  Additional  events  in  the  categories  of  myositis, 
myocarditis,  and  rhabdomyolysis  were  recently  identified  as  OESIs  but  were  not  included  in  the 
programmed outputs. 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  the  majority  of  select  AEs  reported  were  Grade  1-2,  and  most  were 
considered drug-related by the investigator. The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related select 
AE categories with nivolumab treatment were skin (23.0%) and gastrointestinal (9.5%) (Table 49).

in CA209275 and Integrated Population 
Across  select  AE  categories,  the  majority  of  events  were  manageable,  with  resolution  occurring  when 
immune-modulating  medications  (mostly  systemic  corticosteroids)  were  administered.  Some  endocrine 
select AEs, though well-controlled with hormone replacement therapy, were not considered resolved due 
to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. 
Endocrine Events 
The  endocrine  select  AE  category  included  the  following  subcategories:  adrenal  disorders,  diabetes, 
pituitary disorders, and thyroid disorders.  
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  endocrine  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any  grade)  were  reported  in  52 
(14.9%) subjects treated with nivolumab, 43 (15.9%) in CA209275 and 9 (11.5%) in CA209032.   
45 (12.9%) subjects in the Integrated UC Population had endocrine select AEs that were considered to be 
drug-related  by  the  investigator  (Table  50),  39  (14.4%)  in  CA209275  and  6  (7.7%)  in  CA209032.  The 
most commonly reported drug-related event was  hypothyroidism (7.2%, 7.8% and 5.1%, respectively). 
With the exception of one Grade 3 event of hypophysitis reported in CA209275, all drug-related endocrine 
events were Grade 1-2 and none led to discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The median time to onset of drug-related endocrine AEs was 8.57 weeks.  
Of  the  5  subjects  who  were  treated  with  immune-modulating  medication  (median  duration  of  6.14 
weeks), 2 resolved with resolution time ranging from 0.6 to 22.1+ weeks. Overall, 16 of the 45 subjects 
with drug-related endocrine select AEs resolved, with time to resolution ranging from 0.6 to 51.1+ weeks.

Gastrointestinal Events 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  gastrointestinal  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any  grade)  were  occurring  in 
64 (18.4%) subjects treated with nivolumab, 48 subjects (17.8%) in CA209275 and 16 subjects (20.5%) 
in CA209032. 
33 (9.5%) subjects had GI select AEs that were considered to be drug-related by the investigator (Table 
51). The majority of drug-related diarrhoea events were Grade 1-2; 5 (1.4%) subjects experienced Grade 
3-4 diarrhoea events. Two of the 3 colitis events were Grade 3-4. One event (Grade 3 diarrhoea) led to 
permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  drug-related  GI  select  AEs  was  6.43  weeks.  Of  the  9  subjects  who  were 
treated  with  immune  modulating  medications  (high-dose  corticosteroids  for  a  median  duration  of  1.29 
weeks),  8  subjects  had  resolution  of  their  events.  Overall,  29  of  the  33  subjects  with  drug-related  GI 
select AEs had resolution of their events, with a median time to resolution of 2.14 weeks.

Hepatic Events 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  hepatic  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any  grade)  were  reported  in  45 
(12.9%)  subjects.  14  (4.0%)  subjects  had  hepatic  select  AEs  considered  to  be  drug-related  by  the 
investigator (Table 52). 6 subjects had Grade 3-4 drug-related events. None of the hepatic select AEs led 
to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The median time to onset of drug-related hepatic events was 5.86 weeks. Four subjects were treated with 
immune  modulating  medications  for  a  median  duration  of  13.71  weeks  and  none  of  the  subjects  had 
resolution of the event at the time of the database locks. Overall, 7 of the 14 subjects with drug-related 
hepatic select AEs had resolution of their events; median time to resolution 6.71 weeks.

Pulmonary Events 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  pulmonary  select  AEs  (all-causality,  any  grade)  were  reported  in  14 
(4.0%) subjects with pneumonitis being the most frequently occurring pulmonary select AE.

13  (3.7%)  subjects  had  pulmonary  select  AEs  considered  to  be  drug-related  by  the  investigator  (Table 
53).  Twelve of  these  drug-related  events  were pneumonitis;  2 of  the  12  were  Grade  3-4.  In  addition to 
the  pneumonitis  events,  a  Grade  3-4  drug-related  event  of  interstitial  lung  disease;  was  reported.  Six 
drug-related  pulmonary  select  AEs,  including  the  event  of  interstitial  lung  disease,  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  drug-related  pulmonary  events  was  15.0  weeks.  Eleven  subjects  were 
treated  with  immune  modulating  medication  for  a  median  duration  of  2.43  weeks,  and  3  subjects  had 
resolution  of  the  event.  Overall,  4  of  the  13  subjects  with  drug-related  pulmonary  select  AEs  had 
resolution of their events, with a median time to resolution of 16.14 weeks.

Renal Events 
In the Integrated UC Population, renal select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 50 subjects 
(14.4%)  treated  with  nivolumab.  Renal  select  AEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in  CA209032  than  in 
CA209275  (28.2%  vs.  10.4%  for  any-grade  events);  however,  the  low  frequency  of  events  and  small 
sample size limit interpretation. 
10 subjects (2.9%) had renal select AEs considered to be drug-related by the investigator (Table 54). The 
majority of events were Grade 1-2 and no events lead to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The median time to onset was 10.57 weeks. One subject was treated with high dose corticosteroids with 
resolution of the event. Overall, 5 of the 10 subjects with drug-related renal select AEs had resolution of 
their events; median time to resolution was 16.29 weeks.

Skin Events 
In the Integrated UC Population, skin select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 109 (31.3%) 
subjects.  
Drug-related skin select AEs were reported in 80 (23.0%) subjects (Table 55). The most frequently 
reported drug-related events were pruritus (13.8%), rash (6.0%), and rash maculopapular (5.2%). No 
event of toxic epidermal necrolysis was reported. The majority of drug-related events were Grade 1-2; 6 
(1.7%) subjects experienced Grade 3-4 skin events. Two subjects experienced drug-related skin select 
AEs which led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The median time to onset of drug-related skin select AEs was 4.0 weeks. 25 subjects were treated with 
immune modulating medication for a median of 18.29 weeks with resolution of the event in 10 subjects. 
Overall, 45 of 80 subjects with drug-related skin select AEs had resolution of their events with a median 
time to resolution of 17.14 weeks.

Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  (all-causality,  any  grade)  were 
reported in 8 subjects (2.3%). 5 (1.4%) subjects had hypersensitivity/infusion reactions considered to be 
drug-related by the investigator (Table 56). A Grade 3-4 infusion reaction was reported in 1 subject. No 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions led to permanent discontinuation of nivolumab. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  drug-related  hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  AEs  was  2.14  weeks.  2 
subjects were treated with immune-modulating medication, both resolved, with median time to resolution 
of 0.50 weeks.

Other Events of Special Interest 
Other  events  of  special  interest  (OESIs)  are  events  that  do  not  fulfil  all  criteria  to qualify  as  select  AEs. 
These  events  may  differ 
from 
those  caused  by  non-immunotherapies  and  may 
require 
immunosuppression  as  part  of  their  management.  Analyses  of  OESIs  had  extended  follow-up  (100-day 
window). 
OESIs 
included  the 
following  categories:  demyelination,  encephalitis,  Guillain-Barre  syndrome, 
myasthenic syndrome, pancreatitis, and uveitis.  
The only OESI reported in the Integrated UC Population was a Grade 3-4 OESI of pancreatitis reported in 
CA209032.  Time to  onset of  46.4  weeks  and time  to  resolution  of 3.1  weeks.  The  event  did  not lead  to 
treatment discontinuation nor was it treated with immune-modulating medication. 
No  other  OESIs  were  reported  between  first  dose  and  100  days  after  last  dose  of  study  therapy  in  the 
Integrated UC Population. No OESIs were considered drug-related or serious AEs by the investigator. No 
events in the categories of myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis were identified. 
The total number of subjects in the UC population with at least one immune related adverse reaction was 
40.5% (any grade) ad 7.5% (Grade 3-4) (Table 57). These events are defined as any drug-related select 
adverse  event  (using  30  days  safety  windows)  from  any  of  the  following  categories:  gastrointestinal, 
hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin, endocrine, and hypersensitivity/infusion adverse events. 
The  rate  of  any  grade  event  was  higher  in  study  CA209032  (51.3%)  compared  to  study  CA209275 
(37.4%) mainly due to the difference in rates of select adverse events from the skin category (42.3% vs 
17.4%, refer to Appendix BL.6.102 of the EU UC SCS). The rate of high grade event from any category 
(6.4% vs.7.8%) was similar between studies.

i BMS used the laboratory abnormality change from baseline. This presentation is a conservative approach intended to 
capture the frequency of all laboratory abnormalities regardless of causality. In doing so, the denominator used to 
compute frequency is the number of patients for whom laboratory abnormalities data were reported, as opposed to 
ALL treated patients. Hence, there is variability in the denominator for each individual laboratory abnormality and their 
respective reported frequencies.

lipase  (Table  64).  Amylase  and  lipase  worsened  to  Grade  3-4  relative  to  baseline  in  5.7%  and  7.1%  of 
subjects,  respectively.  There  were  no  discontinuations  of  study  therapy  due  to  reported  elevated  lipase 
and/or  amylase  AEs.  Grade  4  amylase  or  lipase  abnormalities  not  associated  with  symptoms  or  clinical 
manifestation of pancreatitis.

Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
In the Integrated UC Population, the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs among all treated 
subjects  for  subgroups  of  gender,  race,  age,  and  region  were  consistent  with  the  AE  frequencies  in  the 
overall  treated  population.  Small  numerical  differences  in  frequencies  of  AEs  were  observed  in  the 
following subgroups: 
-  Any-grade and Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs for male (67.5% and 17.0%) vs. female (72.3% and 
25.3%). There were 265 male and 83 female treated subjects. 
-  Slightly  higher  frequencies  of  any-grade  and  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  in 
subjects in Japan (73.9% and 17.4%) and US (72.1% and 21.8%) versus Rest of World (64.4% 
and 16.3%). There were 23, 165, and 160 treated subjects in Japan, US, and Rest of World. 
Frequencies  of  AEs  leading  to  dropout,  accident  and  injuries,  cardiac  and  vascular  disorders  increased 
slightly  across  the  age  groups  (<65;  65-74;  75-84;  >=85  years),  but  were  otherwise  consistent  for  all 
age groups.

Withdrawal and Rebound 
No cases of withdrawal symptoms related to nivolumab were reported during human clinical trials. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population  most  subjects  received  all  doses  of  nivolumab  without  an  infusion 
interruption,  infusion  rate  reduction,  or  dose  delay.  Reasons  for  infusion  interruption,  infusion  rate 
reduction, or dose delay are provided in Table 66. Infusion interruptions were reported for 14 (4.0%) of 
subjects, 6 (18.2%) of infusion interruptions were due to a hypersensitivity reaction. There were no dose 
interruptions  in  CA209032.  Dose  delays  were  reported  in  135  (38.8%)  of  subjects.  Dose  delays  due  to 
AEs were reported for 66.4% (140/211) of all doses received.

Table 66 Infusion Interruption, Infusion Rate Reduction, and Dose Delays of Study Therapy - 
All Treated Subjects 
In the Integrated UC Population, AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 17.8% of subjects (Table 
67).  Grade  3-4  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  in  13.2%  subjects.  The  most  frequently 
reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  malignant  neoplasm  progression  (3.2%),  general  physical 
health deterioration and pneumonitis (1.4% each), and respiratory failure and small intestinal obstruction 
(0.9% each). 
In  CA209032,  the  frequencies  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  lower  (7.7%)  than  the  Integrated 
UC Population (17.8%), however, this difference may be of limited interpretability due to low sample size. 
In CA209275, the frequencie of AEs leading to discontinuation was 20.7%. 
Grade  3-4  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  in  5.1%  and  15.6%  subjects  in  CA209032  and 
CA209275 respectively.  
In  the  Integrated  UC  Population,  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  in  4.3%  of 
subjects ( 
Table  68).  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  in  2.9%  of  subjects. 
Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation reported in at least 2 subjects were pneumonitis (1.4%) and 
pemphigoid (0.6%).

Immunogenicity 
The incidence of immunogenicity and impact on safety in UC is similar to that observed for other tumor 
types. 
CA209275: Of the 219 UC subjects who were evaluable for ADA, 52 (23.7 %) subjects had at least one 
ADA  positive  sample  relative  to  baseline  at  any  time  after  initiation  of  treatment.  No  subjects  were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/392346/2017 
Page 93/106 
 
  
  
 
 
 
persistent  positive,  and  4  subjects  (1.8%)  were  neutralizing  ADA  positive.  Of  all  subjects  who  were 
evaluable  for  ADA,  no  subject  that  was  ADA  positive  experienced  hypersensitivity/infusion  reaction 
category events. Thus, immunogenicity did not appear to have an effect on the safety of nivolumab in the 
UC subjects. 
CA209032: The incidence of nivolumab ADA positive was low (9 subjects [13.0%] had at least one ADA 
positive sample relative to baseline at any time after initiation of treatment). Only 1 ADA positive subject 
had Grade 1 hypersensitivity/infusion reaction on Day 1 after the first dose of nivolumab. Given that this 
subject  was  ADA  positive  on  Days  1  (baseline),  15,  29,  and  99  and  continued  to  receive  nivolumab 
treatment for 6 months with no other occurrences of hypersensitivity/infusion reaction, it is unlikely that 
the Day 1 occurrence was ADA related. 
Integrated  analysis:  An  integrated  analysis  of  immunogenicity  assessments  was  performed  with  data 
available from the following studies: CA209037, CA209063, CA209066, CA209017, CA209057, CA209067 
(nivolumab monotherapy arm), CA209025, CA209039, CA209205, CA209141, CA209032, and CA209275. 
These  studies  included  data  from  NSCLC,  melanoma,  RCC,  cHL,  SCCHN,  and  UC  subjects.  Overall,  the 
incidence  of  nivolumab  ADA  was  11.4%.  There  was  no  association  established  between  the  presence  of 
ADA and hypersensitivity or infusion reactions. 
Post marketing experience 
Nivolumab was first approved on 04-Jul-2014 in Japan for unresectable melanoma and has since been 
approved in multiple countries, including the US and in the EU, and for other indications (e.g., metastatic 
NSCLC, advanced RCC, and cHL [US only]). Based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by BMS 
Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology, review of postmarketing safety data is consistent with, and 
confirms the clinical trial safety data for nivolumab.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Integrated safety data were presented for 348 UC subjects from CA209275 (n=270) and CA209032 (n= 
78, nivolumab monotherapy UC cohort), hereafter referred to as the ‘Integrated UC Population’.  
Any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 99.1% of subjects treated with nivolumab. The 
most frequently reported AEs were: fatigue (37.1%), nausea (23.9%), anaemia (20.1%), decreased 
appetite (20.1%), and cough (17.8%). Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 51.7% of 
subjects. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs were anaemia (6.9%), urinary tract infection 
(5.7%), malignant neoplasm progression (4.3%), dyspnoea (3.7%), asthenia (3.2%), and hyponatremia 
(3.2%). Frequencies of all-causality AEs (any grade and Grade 3-4) for CA209032 tended to be higher 
than the Integrated UC Population, however, this difference may be of limited interpretability due to low 
sample size. 
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported in 68.7% of subjects. The most frequently reported drug-
related AEs were fatigue (21.0%), pruritus (13.8%), diarrhoea (8.9%), nausea (8.3%), and decreased 
appetite (7.8%). Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 19.0% of subjects. The most frequently 
reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were lipase increased (2.3%) and fatigue (2.0%). 
With regards to AE in the integrated UC population and across pooled monotherapy studies, anaemia was 
the only newly reported all-causality PT reported in >20% subjects for the integrated UC population. 
Diarrhoea and dyspnoea for study CA209032 tended to be higher than from nivolumab monotherapy 
studies in other tumor types. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/392346/2017 
Page 94/106 
 
  
  
According to the data submitted, the safety profile of nivolumab in UC population has a slight higher rate 
of AEs Grade 3-4 (regardless of causality and drug-related) and deaths (within 30 and 100 days) than 
previously submitted pooled data of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma, NSCLC and RCC.  
SAE were reported in 52.6% of subjects. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 35.1% of subjects and the 
most frequently reported SAEs were malignant neoplasm progression (11.5%), urinary tract infection 
(5.2%), general physical health deterioration (2.6%), sepsis (2.3%), and diarrhoea and small intestinal 
obstruction (2.0%). 
Drug-related SAE were reported in 9.5% of subjects. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were reported in 6.6% 
of subjects. Drug-related SAEs reported in at least 2 subjects were pneumonitis and diarrhoea, 5 (1.4%) 
each; fatigue, 3 (0.9%); colitis, nausea, and pemphigoid, 2 (0.6%) subjects each. 
Six (1.7%) deaths assessed by the investigator due to study drug toxicity. There were 4 deaths in 
CA209275 (pneumonitis, respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure and acute respiratory failure) and two 
deaths in CA209032 (pneumonitis and thrombocytopenia). Across both studies (CA209275 and 
CA209032), there were 6 deaths assessed by the investigator as due to study drug toxicity (pneumonitis 
[2], respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia and cardiovascular failure). 
The majority of AESIs reported were Grade 1-2, and most were considered drug-related by the 
investigator. The most frequently reported any-grade drug-related select AE categories with nivolumab 
treatment were skin (23.0%) and gastrointestinal (9.5%).The majority of events were manageable, with 
resolution occurring when immune-modulating medications (mostly systemic corticosteroids) were 
administered.  
In terms of drug-related AESI, endocrine select AE were reported in 12.9% of subjects, the most 
commonly reported was hypothyroidism (7.2%). With the exception of one Grade 3 event of hypophysitis 
reported in CA209275. In the gastrointestinal category, AESIs were occurring in 9.5% of subjects, 1.4% 
subjects experienced Grade 3-4 diarrhoea events. Two of the 3 colitis events were Grade 3-4. Hepatic 
select AEs were reported in 4.0% of subjects, six subjects had Grade 3-4 drug-related events. Pulmonary 
select AE were reported in 3.7% of subjects. Pneumonitis being the most frequently occurring pulmonary 
select AE. Twelve of these drug-related events were pneumonitis; 2 of the 12 were Grade 3-4. In addition 
to the pneumonitis events, a Grade 3-4 drug-related event of interstitial lung disease; was reported. 
Renal select AR were reported in 2.9% subjects. Skin select AEs were reported in 23.0%subjects. The 
most frequently reported drug-related events were pruritus (13.8%), rash (6.0%), and rash 
maculopapular (5.2%). 1.7% subjects experienced Grade 3-4 skin events.  
Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were reported in 5 (1.4%) subjects. A Grade 3-4 infusion reaction was 
reported in 1 subject. No hypersensitivity/infusion reactions led to permanent discontinuation of 
nivolumab. 
The only OESI reported in the Integrated UC Population was a Grade 3-4 OESI of pancreatitis reported in 
CA209032.No events in the categories of myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis were identified. 
In the Integrated UC Population, the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs among all treated 
subjects for subgroups of gender, race, age, and region were consistent with the AE frequencies in the 
overall treated population. No consistent differences were observed in the frequencies of AEs by PD-L1 
expression subgroup. 
Discontinuation due to AE was reported in 17.8% of subjects. Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation 
were reported in 13.2% subjects. The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation were 
malignant neoplasm progression (3.2%), general physical health deterioration and pneumonitis (1.4% 
each), and respiratory failure and small intestinal obstruction (0.9% each). Drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 4.3% of subjects. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/392346/2017 
Page 95/106 
 
  
  
were reported in 2.9% of subjects. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation reported in at least 2 
subjects were pneumonitis (1.4%) and pemphigoid (0.6%). 
The rate of antibody positive subjects in trial CA209275, was 2-fold that of the pool of previous trials 
(23.7%). This finding is not considered clinically relevant taking into account that no patients was 
persistently positive and only 4 patients (1.8%) tested positively for neutralizing antibodies. Moreover 
ADA titres in ADA positive subjects were low, ranging from 1 to 32. There was no evidence of loss of 
efficacy in subjects with neutralizing antibodies and there were no associated adverse events. The rate of 
antibody positive subjects in the Phase II trial CA209032 was lower (13%). Only one patient in the UC 
experienced a safety event (grade 1 hypersensitivity/infusion reaction) in the phase II trial. 
There was no association established between the presence of ADA and hypersensitivity or infusion 
reactions, suggesting nivolumab ADA does not alter the safety profile of nivolumab. Immunogenicity did 
not appear to have an effect on the safety of nivolumab in the UC subjects no evidence of an altered 
safety profile (refer PK-PD assessment). In the pooled analysis, of the 2022 patients who were treated 
with nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-product-
antibodies, 231 patients (11.4%) tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-product-antibodies with 
fifteen patients (0.7 %) testing positive for neutralising antibodies (see SmPC section 4.8).  
The overall safety profile of nivolumab 3 mg/kg in urothelial carcinoma patients (n = 348) was consistent 
with that established across tumour types for nivolumab monotherapy. Hence, no major SmPC changes 
to section 4.8 have been made. The integrated UC safety data has been added to the safety pool 
nivolumab monotherapy (n = 2578) in variation II/32 which is under assessment. 
Patients with a baseline performance score ≥2, active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, 
active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded 
from the clinical trials of urothelial carcinoma (see SmPC sections 4.4., 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of 
data, nivolumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the 
potential benefit-risk on an individual basis. Patients with brain metastases have been included as missing 
information in the RMP.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the integrated analyses of safety from CA209275 and CA209032 of nivolumab monotherapy in 
patients with histologically confirmed UC of the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder or urethra with tumour 
progression or recurrence on or after at least 1 platinum-based regimen, the safety profile of nivolumab 
3 mg/kg Q2W is considered acceptable in the context of the observed clinical activity. The frequency and 
severity of select AEs were acceptable, with the majority of subjects experiencing resolution when 
immune-modulating medications were administered. Clinically significant select AEs were manageable 
using treatment algorithms that recommend nivolumab dose delay or discontinuation and introduction of 
immune-modulating therapy or other targeted medical intervention (e.g., hormone replacement therapy 
for endocrine events). 
No new risks in addition to those identified in previous studies in other indications were identified.

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 3/07/2017.  
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.0 is acceptable. The PRAC advice is 
attached. 
Following subsequent list of outstanding issues and responses from the applicant, the CHMP endorsed this 
advice with the following changes: 
Patients with active brain metastases should be included under missing information, as those subjects 
were excluded from the clinical trials and therefore the benefit risk is unsure in this population. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 7.1 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for a new indication for nivolumab (Opdivo) in locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy. 
In the EU, bladder cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer, with approximately 124,188 new 
cases and 40,635 resulting deaths reported in 201215. Urothelial carcinoma, also known as transitional 
cell carcinoma, is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 90% of cases. Among patients 
diagnosed with UC, the majority have non-muscle invasive (approximately half) or localized muscle-
invasive disease (approximately 1 in 3) at the time of diagnosis, with the remaining patients having

metastatic disease. Approximately 50% of patients presenting with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer 
eventually develop metastatic recurrence after therapy for clinically localised disease. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In locally advanced unresectable or metastatic UC after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy, the 
available monotherapy therapies provide a response rate ranging between 10-15%, which seems to be 
translated into a median overall survival of around 8-9 months at best16. Vinflunine, taxanes, gemcitabine 
and pemetrexed are the current therapeutic alternatives usually offered to this population in the EU17. 
However, taxanes-combination therapies could offer responses in a higher number of patients (30-70%), 
leading to an increase in OS, even though the high toxicity associated with these combinations limits their 
use18. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two on-going studies are presented in support of the claimed indication, i.e. one Phase 1/2 study in 
multiple tumour types, including unresectable locally advanced or metastatic UC (CA209032) and one 
Phase 2 study in metastatic or unresectable urothelial cancer (CA209275).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Outcomes from the pivotal trial (study CA209275; clinical cut-off of 21-Jul-2016) in terms of confirmed 
ORR by BICR (primary endpoint) showed a response rate of 20% (95% CI 15.4, 25.3) in all treated 
patients (n=270) (23% by investigator assessment; CI 95% 18.1, 28.4), with a median of duration of 
10.35 months (more than half [34/54, 63.0%] of the responders had ongoing response at the time of the 
clinical cut-off) and with a time to objective response of around 2 months. Median OS was 8.57 months, 
even though the percentage of events was roughly 58%. Median PFS was 2 months.  
Consistent results were reported from the supportive study CA209032 (n=78), where the confirmed ORR 
based on investigator assessment was 24% (CI 95% 15.3, 35.4) and similar PFS and OS results were 
achieved (median PFS 2.78 months and 9.72 months of OS). 
These results were better in those patients with PD-L1 expression >1%, with confirmed ORR (BICR) of 
25% (CI 95% 17.7, 33.6), median OS 11.63 months (CI 95% 9,10, NA) and median PFS 3.55 months (CI 
95% 1.94, 3.71) in the pivotal Study CA209275. Patients with PD-L1 expression<1% had an ORR of 
16%. Median PFS and median OS were 5.95 months (95% CI: 4.37, 8.08 months) and 1.9 months 
respectively in PD-L1 <1% subgroup. 
As expected, results in those subgroups of patients with poorer prognosis (visceral and hepatic 
metastasis, high ECOG) obtained lower ORR. Of note the response rate was according to the different age 
groups, where the older subgroups showed the better results. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects derives from the study design as 
single arm trials, where there is no other treatment to compare second line treatment of urothelial 
carcinoma in this heterogeneous patient population. No phase III trials are ongoing or planned for

nivolumab in this setting. Therefore, uncertainties exist on the accuracy of the estimation of the benefit in 
the absence of an adequately designed randomised controlled trial. Nevertheless results from the two 
nivolumab studies are consistent with each other and the data supports the benefit observed in terms of 
ORR.  
In the subgroups of patients with low/no tumour PD-L1 expression, results were less outstanding than 
that observed with patients with tumours with higher tumour PD-L1 expression. Patients with PD-L1 
expression <1% had an ORR of 16% compared with 25% in patients with >1% PD-L1 expression. The 
supportive study CA209032 did not show a difference in ORR based on PD-L1 expression, with an ORR of 
24% and 26% for patients with above 1% expression and below 1% expression, respectively. In terms of 
survival benefit, patients with PD-L1 expression below 1%, showed a shorter median survival than those 
classified as PD-L1>1%. However, the benefit in terms of survival rate at 1 year in these patients is 
considered similar to chemotherapy (34% nivolumab vs 31% chemotherapy from Bellmunt et al. NEJM 
2017) and the 1-year survival rate in responders was close to 96%. Furthermore, durable responses were 
observed across all PD-L1 subgroups. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety and tolerability of nivolumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic UC 
was similar to what has been observed in other indications with nivolumab. No new safety concerns were 
raised and the important safety concerns remain the same. 
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported in 68.7% of subjects treated with nivolumab in Integrated UC 
Population. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were fatigue (21.0%), pruritus (13.8%), 
diarrhoea (8.9%), nausea (8.3%), and decreased appetite (7.8%). Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were 
reported in 19.0% of subjects. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were lipase 
increased (2.3%) and fatigue (2.0%). 
The immunogenic potential of nivolumab was found to be low and did not appear to be affect safety 
profile. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main study as well as the supportive study had a single arm study design.  This may have affected 
adverse event reporting. However, this is not expected to have a large impact on the conclusions drawn 
for the efficacy and safety of the product.  
Subjects with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases, active autoimmune disease, or 
medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the clinical trials of 
urothelial carcinoma and therefore the B/R is uncertain in this population. However, the current SmPC 
accurately reflects a warning regarding the potential risks associated with treating patients with active, 
known or suspected autoimmune disease.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
From a clinical perspective, patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma after failure of prior platinum- 
containing therapy, have a poor prognosis. According to the bibliography, the therapeutic landscape 
based on monotherapies after a first treatment of platinum (vinflunine, taxanes, gemcitabine and 
pemetrexed) offers ORRs that range between 10-15% with a median OS of 8-9 months; with the 
exception of gemcitabine that as a single agent has demonstrated ORRs of 11-29%, with median OS that 
ranged from 5 to 13 months, as second-line therapy in a small Phase 2 study (N<50). On the other hand, 
efficacy results reported for most taxane-based combinations seem to offer 30-70% ORRs, with longer 
survival than monotherapies. However, taxane-based combination therapy is accompanied by high 
toxicity and currently used in a minority of the patients. 
Treatment with nivolumab showed consistently higher rates of tumour responses (25%) and a trend for 
higher OS (12 months) as compared to available monotherapy options in the subset of patients with high 
PD-L1 expression (i.e. >1%). While the response rates in patients with tumours designated as PD-L1  
<1% are lower than for patients with tumours designated as PD-L1 >1%,  they seem similar or slightly 
superior than what is observed for other available options. The responses had a clinically relevant 
duration across all PD-L1 subgroups, which appear better than DoRs described for all other available 
therapies (including combination-chemotherapy).  
Although  patients  with  PD-L1  expression  below  1%  showed  a  shorter  median  survival  than  those 
classified as PD-L1>1% (respectively 6 vs 12 months), the 1 year survival rate provided similar results to 
chemotherapy in the overall population of patients PD-L1<1% (34% nivolumab versus 31% reported for 
chemotherapy in Bellmunt et al. NEJM 2017) and the 1-year survival rate in responders was close to 96% 
which  is  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Furthermore,  in  patients  with  both  PD-L1  expression<1%  and 
the  presence  of  poor  prognostic  factors,  the  OS  rates  at  1  year  appear  similar  to  those  reported  with 
chemotherapy in this population. 
The overall safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in CA209275 and CA209032 has been characterised. 
No new safety concerns were identified in UC setting.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The safety profile of nivolumab compares favourably to chemotherapy and the benefit in those patients 
considered PD-L1>1% is considered clinically meaningful, both in terms of durable ORR and OS. In 
patients with low PD-L1 expression (<1%) the use of nivolumab will likely provide both comparable rates 
of response and similar survival benefit to that reported for chemotherapy, however the responses 
observed are more durable than achieved with currently available therapy. Considering the observed 
benefit and safety profile in the overall patient population, the indication is not restricted to patients with 
tumour expressing PD-L1. Furthermore, no specific PD-L1 expression cut-off that would select patients 
benefiting most from nivolumab could be identified and further biomarkers assessment is needed (see 
Annex II). 
In conclusion, the benefit/risk balance is positive for nivolumab monotherapy in the treatment of locally 
advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults after failure of prior platinum-
containing therapy. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH provided additional analyses for several biomarkers which might predict treatment response. 
Currently none of the assessed biomarkers could adequately differentiate the responders from the non-
responders. Further evaluation on the association between improved clinical outcomes to nivolumab and 
PD-L1 expression on both immune cells and tumour cells in a quantitative, prospective manner, using 
validated assays and methods, is lacking at this stage. Other biomarkers such as other gene signatures, 
mutational and neoantigen load remain to be evaluated. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab therapy should be further explored, 
specifically: 
• 
To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell 
membrane level by IHC (e.g., other genomic-based methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, 
that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, 
PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, 
expression of components of antigen-presentation complexes and/or other inhibitory checkpoint 
receptors/ligands within tumour, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be provided 
for urothelial carcinoma studies CA209275 and CA209032  (by 30 June 2018) 
• 
To further explore in UC patients, methods to aid in the early identification of those who did not 
respond to treatment with nivolumab, as well as to evaluate the association between improved 
clinical outcomes to nivolumab and the presence of: 
o  Mutational and neoantigen load, and if feasible, PD-L1 expression on tumour- and tumour 
associated immune cells using validated approaches (by 30 June 2018)

SmPC, 
The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been 
Labelling and 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. The MAH 
PL 
has submitted an Addendum to Clinical Overview (ACO) to 
provide details of the efficacy and safety of Clopidogrel 
Teva since its approval. In the CHMP’s view the provided 
data do not change the overall knowledge about the 
beneficial effect and safety profile of clopidogrel when used 
in the approved indications. 
The beneficial effect of Clopidogrel Teva  remains in line 
with that of the originator product (Plavix), and is 
considered positive.

- Addition of a consequential information concerning 
this interaction in section 4.4. 
The Section 2 of the Package leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. 
To update section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effects – System 
Organ Class: Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ 
of the SmPC to add information on Core Data Sheet 
linked to clopidogrel INN: 
- Addition of a new undesirable effect ‘Rash 
exfoliative’. 
Finally, minor editorial changes have been proposed 
in section 5 of labelling of the outer carton. The 
contact details of the local representatives for 
Luxembourg, Malta, Iceland and Cyprus were 
updated. Also, the Danish, Italian and French 
Package Leaflet were brought in line with the 
innovator text as some editorial differences were 
detected.

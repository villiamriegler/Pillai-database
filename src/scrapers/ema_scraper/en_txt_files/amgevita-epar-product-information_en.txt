Juvenile idiopathic arthritis  
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
AMGEVITA in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response 
to one or more DMARDs. AMGEVITA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to 
methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the efficacy in 
monotherapy see section 5.1). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged less than 2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of 
age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy 
(see section 5.1). 
Axial spondyloarthritis  
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who 
have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.  
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS  
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without 
radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and/or MRI, 
who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Psoriatic arthritis  
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when 
the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. AMGEVITA reduces the rate of 
progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by x-ray in patients with polyarticular 
symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1) and improves physical function.

adolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate 
candidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne 
inversa) in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional 
systemic HS therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Crohn’s disease  
AMGEVITA is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, in adult 
patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and/or an immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such 
therapies. 
Paediatric Crohn's disease  
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in 
paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy 
including primary nutrition therapy and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are 
intolerant to or have contraindications for such therapies.  
Ulcerative colitis  
AMGEVITA is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies. 
Paediatric ulcerative colitis 
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in 
paediatric patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy 
including corticosteroids and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are 
intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. 
Uveitis 
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in 
adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of 
corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. 
Paediatric uveitis 
AMGEVITA is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in 
patients from 2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional 
therapy, or in whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. 
4.2   Posology and method of administration  
AMGEVITA treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which AMGEVITA is indicated. Ophthalmologists are 
advised to consult with an appropriate specialist before initiation of treatment with AMGEVITA (see 
section 4.4). Patients treated with AMGEVITA should be given the Patient Reminder Card.  
After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with AMGEVITA if their 
physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary.  
During treatment with AMGEVITA, other concomitant therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or 
immunomodulatory agents) should be optimised. 
Posology 
Rheumatoid arthritis  
The recommended dose of AMGEVITA for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 40 mg 
adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. Methotrexate 
should be continued during treatment with AMGEVITA.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glucocorticoids, salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesics can be continued 
during treatment with AMGEVITA. Regarding combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drugs other than methotrexate see sections 4.4 and 5.1.  
In monotherapy, some patients who experience a decrease in their response to AMGEVITA 40 mg 
every other week may benefit from an increase in dose to 40 mg adalimumab every week or 80 mg 
every other week. 
Available adalimumab data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of 
treatment. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time 
period. 
Dose interruption  
There may be a need for dose interruption, for instance before surgery or if a serious infection occurs.  
Available data suggest that re-introduction of adalimumab after discontinuation for 70 days or longer 
resulted in the same magnitudes of clinical response and similar safety profile as before dose 
interruption. 
Ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and psoriatic 
arthritis  
The recommended dose of AMGEVITA for patients with ankylosing spondylitis, axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS and for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 40 mg 
adalimumab administered every other week as a single dose via subcutaneous injection. 
Available data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. 
Continued therapy should be reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.  
Psoriasis  
The recommended dose of AMGEVITA for adult patients is an initial dose of 80 mg administered 
subcutaneously, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given every other week starting one week after the 
initial dose. 
Continued therapy beyond 16 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding 
within this time period.  
Beyond 16 weeks, patients with inadequate response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week may 
benefit from an increase in dose to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. The benefits and 
risks of continued 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week therapy should be carefully reconsidered 
in a patient with an inadequate response after the increase in dose (see section 5.1). If adequate 
response is achieved with 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week, the dose may subsequently 
be reduced to 40 mg every other week. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
The recommended AMGEVITA dose regimen for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is 
160 mg initially at day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day 
for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later at day 15 (given as two 40 mg 
injections in one day). Two weeks later (day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every week or 80 mg 
every other week (given as two 40 mg injections in one day). Antibiotics may be continued during 
treatment with AMGEVITA if necessary. It is recommended that the patient should use a topical 
antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment with AMGEVITA. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Continued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no 
improvement within this time period.  
Should treatment be interrupted, AMGEVITA 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be 
re-introduced (see section 5.1).  
The benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see 
section 5.1). 
Crohn’s disease  
The recommended AMGEVITA induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderately to severely 
active Crohn’s disease is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg at week 2. In case there is a need for a 
more rapid response to therapy, the regimen 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one 
day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg at week 2 (given 
as two 40 mg injections in one day), can be used with the awareness that the risk for adverse events is 
higher during induction.  
After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via subcutaneous 
injection. Alternatively, if a patient has stopped AMGEVITA and signs and symptoms of disease 
recur, AMGEVITA may be re-administered. There is little experience from re-administration after 
more than 8 weeks since the previous dose. 
During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice 
guidelines.  
Some patients who experience decrease in their response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week 
may benefit from an increase in dose to 40 mg AMGEVITA every week or 80 mg every other week.  
Some patients who have not responded by week 4 may benefit from continued maintenance therapy 
through week 12. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding 
within this time period.  
Ulcerative colitis  
The recommended AMGEVITA induction dose regimen for adult patients with moderate to severe 
ulcerative colitis is 160 mg at week 0 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg 
injections per day for two consecutive days) and 80 mg at week 2 (given as two 40 mg injections in 
one day). After induction treatment, the recommended dose is 40 mg every other week via 
subcutaneous injection. 
During maintenance treatment, corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice 
guidelines.  
Some patients who experience decrease in their response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week 
may benefit from an increase in dose to 40 mg AMGEVITA every week or 80 mg every other week.  
Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved within 2-8 weeks of treatment. 
AMGEVITA therapy should not be continued in patients failing to respond within this time period. 
Uveitis 
The recommended dose of AMGEVITA for adult patients with uveitis is an initial dose of 80 mg, 
followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. There is limited 
experience in the initiation of treatment with adalimumab alone. Treatment with AMGEVITA can be 
initiated in combination with corticosteroids and/or with other non-biologic immunomodulatory 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agents. Concomitant corticosteroids may be tapered in accordance with clinical practice starting two 
weeks after initiating treatment with AMGEVITA. 
It is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a 
yearly basis (see section 5.1).

should be followed.  
The safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis has been assessed for a mean of 
13 months.  
There is no relevant use of adalimumab in children aged less than 4 years for this indication.  
Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years of age, weighing at least 30 kg) 
There are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. The posology of 
AMGEVITA in these patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation 
(see section 5.2). 
The recommended AMGEVITA dose is 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting 
at week 1 via subcutaneous injection. 
In adolescent patients with inadequate response to AMGEVITA 40 mg every other week, an increase 
in dose to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week may be considered. 
Antibiotics may be continued during treatment with AMGEVITA if necessary. It is recommended that 
the patient should use a topical antiseptic wash on their HS lesions on a daily basis during treatment 
with AMGEVITA. 
Continued therapy beyond 12 weeks should be carefully reconsidered in a patient with no 
improvement within this time period. 
Should treatment be interrupted, AMGEVITA may be re-introduced as appropriate. 
The benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be periodically evaluated (see adult data 
in section 5.1). 
There is no relevant use of AMGEVITA in children aged less than 12 years in this indication.

data are available on the use of a AMGEVITA loading dose in children < 6 years of age (see 
section 5.2). 
There is no relevant use of AMGEVITA in children aged less than 2 years in this indication. 
It is recommended that the benefit and risk of continued long-term treatment should be evaluated on a 
yearly basis (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration  
AMGEVITA is administered by subcutaneous injection. Full instructions for use are provided in the 
package leaflet. 
4.3   Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections (see 
section 4.4).  
Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see section 4.4).  
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Infections  
Patients taking TNF-antagonists are more susceptible to serious infections. Impaired lung function 
may increase the risk for developing infections. Patients must therefore be monitored closely for 
infections, including tuberculosis, before, during and after treatment with AMGEVITA. Because the 
elimination of adalimumab may take up to four months, monitoring should be continued throughout 
this period.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with AMGEVITA should not be initiated in patients with active infections including 
chronic or localised infections until infections are controlled. In patients who have been exposed to 
tuberculosis and patients who have travelled in areas of high risk of tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, 
such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis, the risk and benefits of treatment with 
AMGEVITA should be considered prior to initiating therapy (see Other opportunistic infections).  
Patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with AMGEVITA, should be 
monitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of AMGEVITA 
should be discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate 
antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. Physicians 
should exercise caution when considering the use of AMGEVITA in patients with a history of 
recurring infection or with underlying conditions which may predispose patients to infections, 
including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.  
Serious infections 
Serious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or 
other opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in 
patients receiving adalimumab.  
Other serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and 
septicaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.  
Tuberculosis 
Tuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients 
receiving adalimumab. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) 
tuberculosis. 
Before initiation of therapy with AMGEVITA, all patients must be evaluated for both active or 
inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment 
of patient history of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and 
previous and/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin 
test and chest x-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is 
recommended that the conduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. 
Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients 
who are severely ill or immunocompromised.  
If active tuberculosis is diagnosed, AMGEVITA therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  
In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully 
considered.  
If latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be 
consulted.  
If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis 
prophylaxis treatment before the initiation of AMGEVITA, and in accordance with local 
recommendations.  
Use of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of 
AMGEVITA in patients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test 
for tuberculosis and in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate 
course of treatment cannot be confirmed.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in 
patients treated with adalimumab. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active 
tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with adalimumab.  
Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis 
infection (e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or 
after therapy with AMGEVITA.  
Other opportunistic infections 
Opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving 
adalimumab. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-
antagonists and this has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal 
outcomes.  
For patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, 
dyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant 
shock an invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of AMGEVITA should be 
promptly discontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients 
should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive 
fungal infections.  
Hepatitis B reactivation  
Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including adalimumab, 
who are chronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal 
outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with AMGEVITA. 
For patients who test positive for hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in 
the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended.  
Carriers of HBV who require treatment with AMGEVITA should be closely monitored for signs and 
symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination 
of therapy. Adequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in 
conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients 
who develop HBV reactivation, AMGEVITA should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with 
appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.  
Neurological events  
TNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare instances with new onset or 
exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system 
demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating 
disease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use 
of AMGEVITA in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system 
demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of AMGEVITA should be considered if any of these 
disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central 
demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in patients with non-infectious 
intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of AMGEVITA therapy and regularly during treatment to 
assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders.

Allergic reactions  
Serious allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious 
allergic reactions associated with adalimumab were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of 
serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been received following adalimumab 
administration. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of 
AMGEVITA should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  
Immunosuppression  
In a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with adalimumab, there was no 
evidence of depression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or 
change in enumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.  
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  
In the controlled portions of adalimumab clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of 
malignancies including lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist 
compared with control patients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases 
of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased 
background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing 
highly active, inflammatory disease, which complicates the risk estimation. With the current 
knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in 
patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.  
Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to 
22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), including 
adalimumab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other 
cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated 
with immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents 
treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.  
Rare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated 
with adalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is 
usually fatal. Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with adalimumab have occurred in 
young adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for 
inflammatory bowel disease. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 
6-mercaptopurine and AMGEVITA should be carefully considered. A risk for the development of 
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with AMGEVITA cannot be excluded (see 
section 4.8).  
No studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom 
treatment with adalimumab is continued following development of malignancy. Thus additional 
caution should be exercised in considering AMGEVITA treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).  
All patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy 
or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-
melanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with AMGEVITA. Melanoma and Merkel cell 
carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab 
(see section 4.8).  
In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients 
with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in 
the lung or head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. 
All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any 
TNF-antagonist in COPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to 
heavy smoking.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia 
or colon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon 
carcinoma (for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing 
cholangitis), or who had a prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for 
dysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation 
should include colonoscopy and biopsies per local recommendations.  
Haematologic reactions  
Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists. 
Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. 
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with adalimumab. All patients should be advised to 
seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias 
(e.g. persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on AMGEVITA. Discontinuation of 
AMGEVITA therapy should be considered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic 
abnormalities.  
Vaccinations  
Similar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent 
virus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were 
treated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection 
by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab.  
It is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in 
agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy.  
Patients on AMGEVITA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. 
Administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to AMGEVITA in utero is not 
recommended for 5 months following the mother’s last AMGEVITA injection during pregnancy. 
Congestive heart failure  
In a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased 
mortality due to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart 
failure have also been reported in patients receiving adalimumab. AMGEVITA should be used with 
caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). AMGEVITA is contraindicated in 
moderate to severe heart failure (see section 4.3). Treatment with AMGEVITA must be discontinued 
in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure.  
Autoimmune processes  
Treatment with AMGEVITA may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of 
long-term treatment with AMGEVITA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a 
patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with 
AMGEVITA and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with 
AMGEVITA should not be given (see section 4.8).  
Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists  
Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another TNF-
antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the 
nature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar 
toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the 
combination of AMGEVITA and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of AMGEVITA with other biologic DMARDs (e.g. anakinra and 
abatacept) or other TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for 
infections, including serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions (see 
section 4.5).  
Surgery  
There is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with adalimumab. The 
long half-life of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A 
patient who requires surgery while on AMGEVITA should be closely monitored for infections, and 
appropriate actions should be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing 
arthroplasty while receiving adalimumab.  
Small bowel obstruction  
Failure to respond to treatment for Crohn’s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture 
that may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that adalimumab does not worsen or cause 
strictures.  
Elderly 
The frequency of serious infections among adalimumab-treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) 
was higher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular 
attention regarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.  
Paediatric population

Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol of sodium (23 mg) per 0.8 ml dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5  
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 
psoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant 
methotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab was given together with methotrexate 
in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without methotrexate resulted 
in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see 
section 5.1).  
The combination of AMGEVITA and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent 
administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists”).  
The combination of AMGEVITA and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent 
administration of biologic DMARDs or TNF-antagonists”).  
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of child bearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent 
pregnancy and continue its use for at least five months after the last AMGEVITA treatment.

Pregnancy  
A large number (approximately 2 100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab 
resulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1 500 exposed during the first 
trimester, does not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn. 
In a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn’s disease (CD) 
treated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated 
with adalimumab were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. 
The rate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 
(8.7%) in the adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA 
(unadjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with 
CD and 3/32 (9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The 
adjusted OR (accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD 
combined. There were no distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for 
the secondary endpoints spontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and 
serious or opportunistic infections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation 
of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size 
and non-randomised design. 
In a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, 
embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available 
(see section 5.3).  
Due to its inhibition of TNFα, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal 
immune responses in the new born. AMGEVITA should only be used during pregnancy if clearly 
needed. 
Adalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab 
during pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration 
of live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended 
for 5 months following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding  
Limited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk 
at very low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% 
to 1% of the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal 
proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. No effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are 
anticipated. Consequently, AMGEVITA can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility  
Preclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available.  
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
AMGEVITA may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo and visual 
impairment may occur following administration of AMGEVITA (see section 4.8).  
4.8   Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
Adalimumab was studied in 9,506 patients in pivotal controlled and open-label trials for up to 
60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long-
standing disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis 
without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, 
hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis patients. The pivotal controlled studies involved 6,089 patients 
receiving adalimumab and 3,801 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled 
period.  
The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the double-blind, 
controlled portion of pivotal studies was 5.9% for patients taking adalimumab and 5.4% for control 
treated patients.  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are infections (such as nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and sinusitis), injection site reactions (erythema, itching, haemorrhage, pain 
or swelling), headache and musculoskeletal pain. 
Serious adverse reactions have been reported for adalimumab. TNF-antagonists, such as AMGEVITA 
affect the immune system and their use may affect the body’s defence against infection and cancer.  
Fatal and life-threatening infections (including sepsis, opportunistic infections and TB), HBV 
reactivation and various malignancies (including leukaemia, lymphoma and HSTCL) have also been 
reported with use of adalimumab.  
Serious haematological, neurological and autoimmune reactions have also been reported. These 
include rare reports of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, central and peripheral demyelinating events 
and reports of lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  
Paediatric population  
In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients were similar in frequency and type to those seen in 
adult patients.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The following list of adverse reactions is based on experience from clinical trials and on post-
marketing experience and are displayed by system organ class and frequency in table 7 below: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. The highest frequency 
seen among the various indications has been included. An asterisk (*) appears in the SOC column if

2) The mean weight change from baseline for adalimumab ranged from 0.3 kg to 1.0 kg across adult indications 
compared to (minus) -0.4 kg to 0.4 kg for placebo over a treatment period of 4-6 months. Weight increase of 
5-6 kg has also been observed in long-term extension studies with mean exposures of approximately 1-2 years 
without control group, particularly in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The mechanism behind 
this effect is unclear but could be associated with the anti-inflammatory effect of adalimumab. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
The safety profile for patients with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the 
known safety profile of adalimumab. 
Uveitis 
The safety profile for patients with uveitis treated with adalimumab every other week was consistent 
with the known safety profile of adalimumab. 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Injection site reactions  
In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, 12.9% of patients treated with adalimumab 
developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, haemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared 
to 7.2% of patients receiving placebo or active control. Injection site reactions generally did not 
necessitate discontinuation of the medicinal product. 
Infections  
In the pivotal controlled trials in adults and children, the rate of infection was 1.51 per patient year in 
the adalimumab-treated patients and 1.46 per patient year in the placebo and active control-treated 
patients. The infections consisted primarily of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and 
sinusitis. Most patients continued on adalimumab after the infection resolved.  
The incidence of serious infections was 0.04 per patient year in adalimumab-treated patients and 0.03 
per patient year in placebo and active control-treated patients.  
In controlled and open-label adult and paediatric studies with adalimumab, serious infections 
(including fatal infections, which occurred rarely) have been reported, which include reports of 
tuberculosis (including miliary and extra-pulmonary locations) and invasive opportunistic infections 
(e.g. disseminated or extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, 
pneumocystis, candidiasis, aspergillosis and listeriosis). Most of the cases of tuberculosis occurred 
within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders  
No malignancies were observed in 249 paediatric patients with an exposure of 655.6 patient-years 
during adalimumab trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis). In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric 
patients with an exposure of 498.1 patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with 
Crohn’s disease. No malignancies were observed in 77 paediatric patients with an exposure of 80.0 
patient-years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. No 
malignancies were observed in 93 paediatric patients with an exposure of 65.3 patient years during an 
adalimumab trial in paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis. No malignancies were observed in 60 
paediatric patients with an exposure of 58.4 patient years during an adalimumab trial in paediatric 
patients with uveitis. 
During the controlled portions of pivotal adalimumab trials in adults of at least 12 weeks in duration in 
patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, hidradenitis 
suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis, malignancies, other than lymphoma and 
non-melanoma skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 6.8 (4.4, 10.5) per 
1,000 patient-years among 5,291 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 6.3 (3.4, 11.8) per 1,000 
patient-years among 3,444 control patients (median duration of treatment was 4.0 months for 
adalimumab and 3.8 months for control-treated patients). The rate (95% confidence interval) of non-
melanoma skin cancers was 8.8 (6.0, 13.0) per 1,000 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients 
and 3.2 (1.3, 7.6) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. Of these skin cancers, squamous cell 
carcinomas occurred at rates (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (1.4, 5.4) per 1,000 patient-years among 
adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients. The rate 
(95% confidence interval) of lymphomas was 0.7 (0.2, 2.7) per 1,000 patient-years among 
adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6 (0.1, 4.5) per 1,000 patient-years among control patients.  
When combining controlled portions of these trials and ongoing and completed open-label extension 
studies of adalimumab, with a median duration of approximately 3.3 years including 6,427 patients 
and over 26,439 patient-years of therapy, the observed rate of malignancies, other than lymphoma and 
non-melanoma skin cancers is approximately 8.5 per 1,000 patient-years. The observed rate of non-
melanoma skin cancers is approximately 9.6 per 1,000 patient-years, and the observed rate of 
lymphomas is approximately 1.3 per 1,000 patient-years.  
In post-marketing experience from January 2003 to December 2010, predominantly in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, the reported rate of malignancies is approximately 2.7 per 1,000 patient treatment 
years. The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 
0.3 per 1,000 patient treatment years, respectively (see section 4.4). 
Rare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated 
with adalimumab (see section 4.4).  
Autoantibodies  
Patients had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points in rheumatoid arthritis 
studies I−V. In these trials, 11.9% of patients treated with adalimumab and 8.1% of placebo and active 
control-treated patients that had negative baseline anti-nuclear antibody titres reported positive titres at 
week 24. Two patients out of 3,441 treated with adalimumab in all rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic 
arthritis studies developed clinical signs suggestive of new onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients 
improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central 
nervous system symptoms.

Hepatobiliary events  
In controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis 
with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 
3.7% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.  
In controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
who were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations 
≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. 
Most ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN 
occurred in the phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
who were 2 to < 4 years.  
In controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with 
a control period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks. ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of 
adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of controlled-treated patients.  
In the phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy 
and safety of two body weight adjusted maintenance dose regimens following body weight adjusted 
induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of 
patients of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline.  
In controlled phase 3 trials of adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis with a control period 
duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-
treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.  
No ALT elevations ≥ 3 X ULN occurred in the phase 3 trial of adalimumab in paediatric patients with 
plaque psoriasis. 
In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2, followed 
by 40 mg every week starting at week 4), in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa with a control 
period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of 
adalimumab-treated patients and 0.6% of control-treated patients. 
In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at week 0 followed by 40 mg every other 
week starting at week 1) in adult patients with uveitis up to 80 weeks with a median exposure of 166.5 
days and 105.0 days in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations 
≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. 
In the controlled phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with paediatric ulcerative colitis (N=93) 
which evaluated efficacy and safety of a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every 
other week (N=31) and a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every week (N=32), 
following body weight adjusted induction dosing of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at week 0 and 
week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at week 2 (N=63), or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg 
(maximum of 160 mg) at week 0, placebo at week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at week 2 
(N=30), ALT elevations ≥ 3 X ULN occurred in 1.1% (1/93) of patients. 
Across all indications in clinical trials patients with raised ALT were asymptomatic and in most cases 
elevations were transient and resolved on continued treatment. However, there have also been post-
marketing reports of liver failure as well as less severe liver disorders that may precede liver failure, 
such as hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis in patients receiving adalimumab.  
Concurrent treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine  
In adult Crohn’s disease studies, higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse 
events were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared 
with adalimumab alone.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors. 
ATC code: L04AB04  
AMGEVITA is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Mechanism of action  
Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  
Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including 
changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, 
and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 0.1-0.2 nM).  
Pharmacodynamic effects  
After treatment with adalimumab, a rapid decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation 
(C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was 
observed, compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Serum levels of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodelling responsible for cartilage 
destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration. Patients treated with adalimumab 
usually experienced improvement in haematological signs of chronic inflammation.  
A rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa after treatment with 
adalimumab. In patients with Crohn’s disease, a reduction of the number of cells expressing 
inflammatory markers in the colon including a significant reduction of expression of TNFα was seen. 
Endoscopic studies in intestinal mucosa have shown evidence of mucosal healing in adalimumab-
treated patients.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Adalimumab was evaluated in over 3,000 patients in all rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. The 
efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomised, double-blind and well-controlled 
studies. Some patients were treated for up to 120 months duration.

RA study I evaluated 271 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were 
≥ 18 years old, had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug and had 
insufficient efficacy with methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg (10 mg if methotrexate-intolerant) 
every week and whose methotrexate dose remained constant at 10 to 25 mg every week. Doses of 20, 
40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks. 
RA study II evaluated 544 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were 
≥ 18 years old and had failed therapy with at least one disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. Doses 
of 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given by subcutaneous injection every other week with placebo 
on alternative weeks or every week for 26 weeks; placebo was given every week for the same 
duration. No other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were allowed.  
RA study III evaluated 619 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who were 
≥ 18 years old, and who had an ineffective response to methotrexate at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg or have 
been intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week. There were three groups in this study. The first 
received placebo injections every week for 52 weeks. The second received 20 mg of adalimumab 
every week for 52 weeks. The third group received 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with 
placebo injections on alternate weeks. Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in 
an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab/MTX was administered every other 
week up to 10 years. 
RA study IV primarily assessed safety in 636 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
arthritis who were ≥ 18 years old. Patients were permitted to be either disease-modifying, anti-
rheumatic drug-naïve or to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy 
was stable for a minimum of 28 days. These therapies include methotrexate, leflunomide, 
hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and/or gold salts. Patients were randomised to 40 mg of 
adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.  
RA study V evaluated 799 methotrexate-naïve, adult patients with moderate to severely active early 
rheumatoid arthritis (mean disease duration less than 9 months). This study evaluated the efficacy of 
adalimumab 40 mg every other week/methotrexate combination therapy, adalimumab 40 mg every 
other week monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate 
of progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis for 104 weeks. Upon completion of the first 104 
weeks, 497 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was 
administered every other week up to 10 years. 
The primary end point in RA studies I, II and III and the secondary endpoint in RA study IV was the 
percent of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24 or 26. The primary endpoint in RA 
study V was the percent of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at week 52. RA studies III and 
V had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of retardation of disease progression (as detected by 
x-ray results). RA study III also had a primary endpoint of changes in quality of life.  
ACR response 
The percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieving ACR 20, 50 and 70 responses was consistent 
across RA studies I, II and III. The results for the 40 mg every other week dose are summarised in 
table 8.

In RA studies I-IV, all individual components of the ACR response criteria (number of tender and 
swollen joints, physician and patient assessment of disease activity and pain, disability index (HAQ) 
scores and CRP (mg/dL) values) improved at 24 or 26 weeks compared to placebo. In RA study III, 
these improvements were maintained throughout 52 weeks.  
In the open-label extension for RA study III, most patients who were ACR responders maintained 
response when followed for up to 10 years. Of 207 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 
40 mg every other week, 114 patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 5 years. 
Among those, 86 patients (75.4%) had ACR 20 responses; 72 patients (63.2%) had ACR 50 responses; 
and 41 patients (36%) had ACR 70 responses. Of 207 patients, 81 patients continued on adalimumab 
40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 64 patients (79.0%) had ACR 20 responses; 56 
patients (69.1%) had ACR 50 responses; and 43 patients (53.1%) had ACR 70 responses. 
In RA study IV, the ACR 20 response of patients treated with adalimumab plus standard of care was 
statistically significantly better than patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (p < 0.001).  
In RA studies I-IV, adalimumab-treated patients achieved statistically significant ACR 20 and 50 
responses compared to placebo as early as one to two weeks after initiation of treatment.  
In RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination 
therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than 
methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52 and responses were sustained at 
week 104 (see table 9).

In the open-label extension for RA study V, ACR response rates were maintained when followed for 
up to 10 years. Of 542 patients who were randomised to adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 170 
patients continued on adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 10 years. Among those, 154 patients 
(90.6%) had ACR 20 responses; 127 patients (74.7%) had ACR 50 responses; and 102 patients 
(60.0%) had ACR 70 responses.  
At week 52, 42.9% of patients who received adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy achieved 
clinical remission (DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6) compared to 20.6% of patients receiving methotrexate 
monotherapy and 23.4% of patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy. Adalimumab/methotrexate 
combination therapy was clinically and statistically superior to methotrexate (p < 0.001) and 
adalimumab monotherapy (p < 0.001) in achieving a low disease state in patients with recently 
diagnosed moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The response for the two monotherapy arms was 
similar (p = 0.447). Of 342 subjects originally randomised to adalimumab monotherapy or 
adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy who entered the open-label extension study, 171 
subjects completed 10 years of adalimumab treatment. Among those, 109 subjects (63.7%) were 
reported to be in remission at 10 years. 
Radiographic response  
In RA study III, where adalimumab-treated patients had a mean duration of rheumatoid arthritis of 
approximately 11 years, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as 
change in modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) and its components, the erosion score and joint space 
narrowing score. Adalimumab/methotrexate patients demonstrated significantly less radiographic 
progression than patients receiving methotrexate alone at 6 and 12 months (see table 10).  
In the open-label extension of RA study III, the reduction in rate of progression of structural damage is 
maintained for 8 and 10 years in a subset of patients. At 8 years, 81 of 207 patients originally treated 
with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were evaluated radiographically. Among those, 48 patients 
showed no progression of structural damage defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or 
less. At 10 years, 79 of 207 patients originally treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week were 
evaluated radiographically. Among those, 40 patients showed no progression of structural damage 
defined by a change from baseline in the mTSS of 0.5 or less.

Following 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, the percentage of patients without progression 
(change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score ≤ 0.5) was significantly higher with 
adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy (63.8% and 61.2% respectively) compared to 
methotrexate monotherapy (37.4% and 33.5% respectively, p < 0.001) and adalimumab monotherapy 
(50.7%, p < 0.002 and 44.5%, p < 0.001 respectively). 
In the open-label extension of RA study V, the mean change from baseline at year 10 in the modified 
Total Sharp Score was 10.8, 9.2 and 3.9 in patients originally randomised to methotrexate 
monotherapy, adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy, 
respectively. The corresponding proportions of patients with no radiographic progression were 31.3%, 
23.7% and 36.7% respectively. 
Quality of life and physical function  
Health-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the disability index of the 
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the four original adequate and well-controlled trials, 
which was a pre-specified primary endpoint at week 52 in RA study III. All doses/schedules of 
adalimumab in all four studies showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the disability 
index of the HAQ from baseline to month 6 compared to placebo and in RA study III the same was 
seen at week 52. Results from the Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) for all doses/schedules of 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adalimumab in all four studies support these findings, with statistically significant physical component 
summary (PCS) scores, as well as statistically significant pain and vitality domain scores for the 
40 mg every other week dose. A statistically significant decrease in fatigue as measured by functional 
assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) scores was seen in all three studies in which it was 
assessed (RA studies I, III, IV).  
In RA study III, most subjects who achieved improvement in physical function and continued 
treatment maintained improvement through week 520 (120 months) of open-label treatment. 
Improvement in quality of life was measured up to week 156 (36 months) and improvement was 
maintained through that time. 
In RA study V, the improvement in the HAQ disability index and the physical component of the SF 36 
showed greater improvement (p < 0.001) for adalimumab/methotrexate combination therapy versus 
methotrexate monotherapy and adalimumab monotherapy at week 52, which was maintained through 
week 104. Among the 250 subjects who completed the open-label extension study, improvements in 
physical function were maintained through 10 years of treatment. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 393 patients in two randomised, 24 week 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (mean baseline 
score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] was 6.3 in 
all groups) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Seventy-nine (20.1%) 
patients were treated concomitantly with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and 37 (9.4%) 
patients with glucocorticoids. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which 
patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 
28 weeks. Subjects (n = 215, 54.7%) who failed to achieve ASAS 20 at weeks 12, or 16 or 20 received 
early escape open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously and were subsequently 
treated as non-responders in the double-blind statistical analyses. 
In the larger AS study I with 315 patients, results showed statistically significant improvement of the 
signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in patients treated with adalimumab compared to 
placebo. Significant response was first observed at week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks (table 
12).

Adalimumab-treated patients had significantly greater improvement at week 12 which was maintained 
through week 24 in both the SF36 and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(ASQoL).  
Similar trends (not all statistically significant) were seen in the smaller randomised, double-blind, 
placebo controlled AS study II of 82 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS  
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in two randomised, double-blind placebo-
controlled studies in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). Study nr-
axSpA I evaluated patients with active nr-axSpA. Study nr-axSpA II was a treatment withdrawal study 
in active nr-axSpA patients who achieved remission during open-label treatment with adalimumab. 
Study nr-axSpA I 
 In Study nr-axSpA I, adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 185 patients in a 
randomised, 12 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with active nr-axSpA (mean 
baseline score of disease activity [Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)] 
was 6.4 for patients treated with adalimumab and 6.5 for those on placebo) who have had an 
inadequate response to or intolerance to ≥ 1 NSAIDs, or a contraindication for NSAIDs.  
Thirty-three (18%) patients were treated concomitantly with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, 
and 146 (79%) patients with NSAIDs at baseline. The double-blind period was followed by an open-
label period during which patients receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up 
to an additional 144 weeks. Week 12 results showed statistically significant improvement of the signs 
and symptoms of active nr-axSpA in patients treated with adalimumab compared to placebo (table 13).

In the open-label extension, improvement in the signs and symptoms was maintained with 
adalimumab therapy through week 156. 
Inhibition of inflammation 
Significant improvement of signs of inflammation as measured by hs-CRP and MRI of both Sacroiliac 
Joints and the Spine was maintained in adalimumab-treated patients through week 156 and week 104, 
respectively. 
Quality of life and physical function 
Health-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using the HAQ-S and the SF-36 
questionnaires. Adalimumab showed statistically significantly greater improvement in the HAQ-S 
total score and the SF-36 Physical Component Score (PCS) from baseline to week 12 compared to 
placebo. Improvement in health-related quality of life and physical function was maintained during the 
open-label extension through week 156. 
Study nr-axSpA II 
673 patients with active nr-axSpA (mean baseline disease activity [BASDAI] was 7.0) who had an 
inadequate response to  2 NSAIDs, or an intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs enrolled 
into the open-label period of Study nr-axSpA II during which they received adalimumab 40 mg every 
other week for 28 weeks. These patients also had objective evidence of inflammation in the sacroiliac 
joints or spine on MRI or elevated hs-CRP. Patients who achieved sustained remission for at least 12 
weeks (N=305) (ASDAS < 1.3 at weeks 16, 20, 24, and 28) during the open-label period were then 
randomised to receive either continued treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (N=152) 
or placebo (N=153) for an additional 40 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled period (total 
study duration 68 weeks). Subjects who flared during the double-blind period were allowed 
adalimumab 40 mg every other week rescue therapy for at least 12 weeks. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with no flare by week 68 of the study. 
Flare was defined as ASDAS ≥ 2.1 at two consecutive visits four weeks apart. A greater proportion of 
patients on adalimumab had no disease flare during the double-blind period, when compared with 
those on placebo (70.4% vs. 47.1%, p < 0.001) (figure 1).

< 1.3) after 12 weeks of restarting the open-label treatment.  
By week 68, patients receiving continuous adalimumab treatment showed statistically significant 
greater improvement of the signs and symptoms of active nr-axSpA as compared to patients allocated 
to treatment withdrawal during the double-blind period of the study (table 14).

Psoriatic arthritis  
Adalimumab, 40 mg every other week, was studied in patients with moderately to severely active 
psoriatic arthritis in two placebo-controlled studies, PsA studies I and II. PsA study I with 24 week 
duration, treated 313 adult patients who had an inadequate response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug therapy and of these, approximately 50% were taking methotrexate. PsA study II with 12-week 
duration, treated 100 patients who had an inadequate response to DMARD therapy. Upon completion

of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab 
was administered every other week.  
There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy of adalimumab in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-
like psoriatic arthropathy due to the small number of patients studied.

ACR responses in PsA study I were similar with and without concomitant methotrexate therapy. ACR 
responses were maintained in the open-label extension study for up to 136 weeks.  
Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis studies. Radiographs of hands, wrists, 
and feet were obtained at baseline and week 24 during the double-blind period when patients were on 
adalimumab or placebo and at week 48 when all patients were on open-label adalimumab. A modified 
Total Sharp Score (mTSS), which included distal interphalangeal joints (i.e. not identical to the TSS 
used for rheumatoid arthritis), was used.  
Adalimumab treatment reduced the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with 
placebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (mean ± SD) 0.8 ± 2.5 in the placebo 
group (at week 24) compared with 0.0 ± 1.9; (p < 0.001) in the adalimumab group (at week 48). 
In subjects treated with adalimumab with no radiographic progression from baseline to week 48 
(n = 102), 84% continued to show no radiographic progression through 144 weeks of treatment. 
Adalimumab-treated patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in physical function 
as assessed by HAQ and Short Form Health Survey (SF 36) compared to placebo at week 24. 
Improved physical function continued during the open-label extension up to week 136. 
Psoriasis  
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were studied in adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis 
(≥ 10% BSA involvement and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 or ≥ 10) who were 
candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy in randomised, double-blind studies. 73% of patients 
enrolled in psoriasis studies I and II had received prior systemic therapy or phototherapy. The safety 
and efficacy of adalimumab were also studied in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis with concomitant hand and/or foot psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy in a 
randomised double-blind study (psoriasis study III). 
Psoriasis study I (REVEAL) evaluated 1,212 patients within three treatment periods. In period A, 
patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other 
week starting one week after the initial dose. After 16 weeks of therapy, patients who achieved at least 
a PASI 75 response (PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline), entered period B 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Patients who maintained ≥ PASI 75 
response at week 33 and were originally randomised to active therapy in period A, were re-randomised 
in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. 
Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 18.9 and the baseline Physician’s 
Global Assessment (PGA) score ranged from “moderate” (53% of subjects included) to “severe” 
(41%) to “very severe” (6%). 
Psoriasis study II (CHAMPION) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus methotrexate 
and placebo in 271 patients. Patients received placebo, an initial dose of MTX 7.5 mg and thereafter 
dose increases up to week 12, with a maximum dose of 25 mg or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab 
followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) for 16 weeks. There are 
no data available comparing adalimumab and MTX beyond 16 weeks of therapy. Patients receiving 
MTX who achieved a ≥ PASI 50 response at week 8 and/or 12 did not receive further dose increases. 
Across all treatment groups, the mean baseline PASI score was 19.7 and the baseline PGA score 
ranged from “mild” (< 1%) to “moderate” (48%) to “severe” (46%) to “very severe” (6%). 
Patients participating in all phase 2 and phase 3 psoriasis studies were eligible to enrol into an open-
label extension trial, where adalimumab was given for at least an additional 108 weeks.  
In psoriasis studies I and II, a primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 
75 response from baseline at week 16 (see tables 16 and 17).

In psoriasis study I, 28% of patients who were PASI 75 responders and were re-randomised to placebo 
at week 33 compared to 5% continuing on adalimumab, p < 0.001, experienced “loss of adequate 
response” (PASI score after week 33 and on or before week 52 that resulted in a < PASI 50 response 
relative to baseline with a minimum of a 6-point increase in PASI score relative to week 33). Of the 
patients who lost adequate response after re-randomisation to placebo who then enrolled into the open-
label extension trial, 38% (25/66) and 55% (36/66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks 
of retreatment, respectively.

A total of 233 PASI 75 responders at week 16 and week 33 received continuous adalimumab therapy 
for 52 weeks in psoriasis study I, and continued adalimumab in the open-label extension trial. PASI 75 
and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these patients were 74.7% and 59.0%, respectively, 
after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy (total of 160 weeks). In an analysis in which all 
patients who dropped out of the study for adverse events or lack of efficacy, or who dose-escalated, 
were considered non-responders, PASI 75 and PGA of clear or minimal response rates in these 
patients were 69.6% and 55.7%, respectively, after an additional 108 weeks of open-label therapy 
(total of 160 weeks).  
A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open-
label extension study. During the withdrawal period, symptoms of psoriasis returned over time with a 
median time to relapse (decline to PGA “moderate” or worse) of approximately 5 months. None of 
these patients experienced rebound during the withdrawal period. A total of 76.5% (218/285) of 
patients who entered the retreatment period had a response of PGA “clear” or “minimal” after 16 
weeks of retreatment, irrespective of whether they relapsed during withdrawal (69.1%[123/178] and 
88.8% [95/107] for patients who relapsed and who did not relapse during the withdrawal period, 
respectively). A similar safety profile was observed during retreatment as before withdrawal.  
Significant improvements at week 16 from baseline compared to placebo (studies I and II) and MTX 
(study II) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index). In study I, improvements 
in the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-36 were also significant compared to 
placebo. 
In an open-label extension study, for patients who dose escalated from 40 mg every other week to 
40 mg weekly due to a PASI response below 50%, 26.4% (92/349) and 37.8% (132/349) of patients 
achieved PASI 75 response at week 12 and 24, respectively. 
Psoriasis study III (REACH) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 72 
patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and hand and/or foot psoriasis. Patients 
received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week 
after the initial dose) or placebo for 16 weeks. At week 16, a statistically significantly greater 
proportion of patients who received adalimumab achieved PGA of 'clear' or 'almost clear' for the hands 
and/or feet compared to patients who received placebo (30.6% versus 4.3%, respectively [P = 0.014]). 
Psoriasis study IV compared efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult patients 
with moderate to severe nail psoriasis. Patients received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed 
by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed 
by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. Nail psoriasis assessments included 
the Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), the Physician’s Global Assessment of 
Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) and the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (see table 18). 
Adalimumab demonstrated a treatment benefit in nail psoriasis patients with different extents of skin 
involvement (BSA ≥ 10% (60% of patients) and BSA < 10% and ≥ 5% (40% of patients)).

Hidradenitis suppurativa 
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
studies and an open-label extension study in adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS) who were intolerant, had a contraindication or an inadequate response to at least a 3-
month trial of systemic antibiotic therapy. The patients in HS-I and HS-II had Hurley Stage II or III 
disease with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. 
Study HS-I (PIONEER I) evaluated 307 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients 
received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg 
every week starting at week 4 to week 11. Concomitant antibiotic use was not allowed during the 
study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab in Period A were re-
randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every week, adalimumab 
40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had been randomised to 
placebo in Period A were assigned to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week in Period B. 
Study HS-II (PIONEER II) evaluated 326 patients with 2 treatment periods. In Period A, patients 
received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 and 
40 mg every week starting at week 4 to week 11. 19.3% of patients had continued baseline oral 
antibiotic therapy during the study. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients who had received adalimumab 
in Period A were re-randomised in Period B to 1 of 3 treatment groups (adalimumab 40 mg every 
week, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, or placebo from week 12 to week 35). Patients who had 
been randomised to placebo in Period A were assigned to receive placebo in Period B. 
Patients participating in Studies HS-I and HS-II were eligible to enrol into an open-label extension 
study in which adalimumab 40 mg was administered every week. Mean exposure in all adalimumab 
population was 762 days. Throughout all 3 studies patients used topical antiseptic wash daily. 
Clinical response 
Reduction of inflammatory lesions and prevention of worsening of abscesses and draining fistulas was 
assessed using Hidradenitis Suppurativa clinical response (HiSCR; at least a 50% reduction in total 
abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining 
fistula count relative to Baseline). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric 
Rating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 
point scale.  
At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with adalimumab versus placebo 
achieved HiSCR. At week 12, a significantly higher proportion of patients in study HS-II experienced 
a clinically relevant decrease in HS-related skin pain (see table 19). Patients treated with adalimumab 
had significantly reduced risk of disease flare during the initial 12 weeks of treatment.

Treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every week significantly reduced the risk of worsening of 
abscesses and draining fistulas. Approximately twice the proportion of patients in the placebo group in 
the first 12 weeks of Studies HS-I and HS-II, compared with those in the adalimumab group 
experienced worsening of abscesses (23.0% versus 11.4%, respectively) and draining fistulas (30.0% 
versus 13.9%, respectively). 
Greater improvements at week 12 from baseline compared to placebo were demonstrated in skin-
specific health-related quality of life, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; 
Studies HS-I and HS-II), patient global satisfaction with medication treatment as measured by the 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire-medication (TSQM; Studies HS-I and HS-II), and physical 
health as measured by the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (study HS-I). 
In patients with at least a partial response to adalimumab 40 mg weekly at week 12, the HiSCR rate at 
week 36 was higher in patients who continued weekly adalimumab than in patients in whom dosing 
frequency was reduced to every other week, or in whom treatment was withdrawn (see table 20).

Among patients who were at least partial responders at week 12, and who received continuous weekly 
adalimumab therapy, the HiSCR rate at week 48 was 68.3% and at week 96 was 65.1%. Longer term 
treatment with adalimumab 40 mg weekly for 96 weeks identified no new safety findings. 
Among patients whose adalimumab treatment was withdrawn at week 12 in Studies HS-I and HS-II, 
the HiSCR rate 12 weeks after re-introduction of adalimumab 40 mg weekly returned to levels similar 
to that observed before withdrawal (56.0%).

Crohn’s disease  
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in over 1,500 patients with moderately to 
severely active Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, 
corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted and 80% of patients continued to 
receive at least one of these medications.  
Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI < 150) was evaluated in two studies, CD study I 
(CLASSIC I) and CD study II (GAIN). In CD study I, 299 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were 
randomised to one of four treatment groups; placebo at weeks 0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 
and 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at week 0 and 20 mg at week 
2. In CD study II, 325 patients who had lost response or were intolerant to infliximab were randomised 
to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 or placebo at weeks 0 and 2. The 
primary non-responders were excluded from the studies and therefore these patients were not further 
evaluated. 
Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in CD study III (CHARM). In CD study III, 854 
patients received open-label 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. At week 4 patients were 
randomised to 40 mg every other week, 40 mg every week, or placebo with a total study duration of 
56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥ 70) at week 4 were stratified and analysed 
separately from those not in clinical response at week 4. Corticosteroid taper was permitted after week 
8.  
CD study I and CD study II induction of remission and response rates are presented in table 21.

Similar remission rates were observed for the 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg induction regimens by week 8 
and adverse events were more frequently noted in the 160/80 mg group.  
In CD study III, at week 4, 58% (499/854) of patients were in clinical response and were assessed in 
the primary analysis. Of those in clinical response at week 4, 48% had been previously exposed to 
other TNF-antagonists. Maintenance of remission and response rates are presented in table 22. Clinical 
remission results remained relatively constant irrespective of previous TNF-antagonist exposure.  
Disease-related hospitalisations and surgeries were statistically significantly reduced with adalimumab 
compared with placebo at week 56.

Among patients who were not in response at week 4, 43% of adalimumab maintenance patients 
responded by week 12 compared to 30% of placebo maintenance patients. These results suggest that 
some patients who have not responded by week 4 benefit from continued maintenance therapy through 
week 12. Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see 
section 4.2).  
117/276 patients from CD study I and 272/777 patients from CD studies II and III were followed 
through at least 3 years of open-label adalimumab therapy. 88 and 189 patients, respectively, 
continued to be in clinical remission. Clinical response (CR-100) was maintained in 102 and 
233 patients, respectively. 
Quality of life  
In CD study I and CD study II, statistically significant improvement in the disease-specific 
inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) total score was achieved at week 4 in patients 
randomised to adalimumab 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg compared to placebo and was seen at weeks 26 
and 56 in CD study III as well among the adalimumab treatment groups compared to the placebo 
group. 
Ulcerative colitis  
The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) 
in randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.  
In study UC-I, 390 TNF-antagonist naïve patients were randomised to receive either placebo at weeks 
0 and 2, 160 mg adalimumab at week 0 followed by 80 mg at week 2, or 80 mg adalimumab at week 0 
followed by 40 mg at week 2. After week 2, patients in both adalimumab arms received 40 mg every 
other week. Clinical remission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no subscore > 1) was assessed at week 
8.  
In study UC-II, 248 patients received 160 mg of adalimumab at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and 40 mg 
every other week thereafter, and 246 patients received placebo. Clinical results were assessed for 
induction of remission at week 8 and for maintenance of remission at week 52.

Patients induced with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved clinical remission versus placebo at week 8 in 
statistically significantly greater percentages in study UC-I (18% versus 9% respectively, p = 0.031) 
and study UC-II (17% versus 9% respectively, p = 0.019). In study UC-II, among those treated with 
adalimumab who were in remission at week 8, 21/41 (51%) were in remission at week 52.  
Results from the overall UC-II study population are shown in table 23.

Of those patients who had a response at week 8, 47% were in response, 29% were in remission, 41% 
had mucosal healing, and 20% were in steroid-free remission for ≥ 90 days at week 52.  
Approximately 40% of patients in study UC-II had failed prior anti-TNF treatment with infliximab. 
The efficacy of adalimumab in those patients was reduced compared to that in anti-TNF naïve 
patients. Among patients who had failed prior anti-TNF treatment, week 52 remission was achieved by 
3% on placebo and 10% on adalimumab.  
Patients from studies UC-I and UC-II had the option to roll over into an open-label long-term 
extension study (UC III). Following 3 years of adalimumab therapy, 75% (301/402) continued to be in 
clinical remission per partial Mayo score. 
Hospitalisation rates  
During 52 weeks of studies UC-I and UC-II, lower rates of all-cause hospitalisations and UC-related 
hospitalisations were observed for the adalimumab-treated arm compared to the placebo arm. The 
number of all cause hospitalisations in the adalimumab treatment group was 0.18 per patient year 
versus 0.26 per patient year in the placebo group and the corresponding figures for UC-related 
hospitalisations were 0.12 per patient year versus 0.22 per patient year. 
Quality of life  
In study UC-II, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score. 
Uveitis 
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious 
intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis, excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or 
adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after 
the initial dose. Concomitant stable doses of one non-biologic immunosuppressant were permitted. 
Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis despite treatment with corticosteroids (oral 
prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a 2 week standardised dose of 
prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete 
corticosteroid discontinuation by week 15. 
Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis requiring chronic corticosteroid treatment 
(oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent 
a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by week 19. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ‘time to treatment failure’. Treatment failure was 
defined by a multi-component outcome based on inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory 
retinal vascular lesions, anterior chamber (AC) cell grade, vitreous haze (VH) grade and best corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA). 
Patients who completed Studies UV I and UV II were eligible to enroll in an uncontrolled long-term 
extension study with an originally planned duration of 78 weeks. Patients were allowed to continue on 
study medication beyond week 78 until they had access to adalimumab. 
Clinical response 
Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment 
failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo (see table 24). Both 
studies demonstrated an early and sustained effect of adalimumab on the treatment failure rate versus 
placebo (see figure 2).

In study UV I statistically significant differences in favour of adalimumab versus placebo were 
observed for each component of treatment failure. In study UV II, statistically significant differences 
were observed for visual acuity only, but the other components were numerically in favour of 
adalimumab. 
Of the 424 subjects included in the uncontrolled long-term extension of Studies UV I and UV II, 60 
subjects were regarded ineligible (e.g. due to deviations or due to complications secondary to diabetic 
retinopathy, due to cataract surgery or vitrectomy) and were excluded from the primary analysis of 
efficacy. Of the 364 remaining patients, 269 evaluable patients (74%) reached 78 weeks of open-label 
adalimumab treatment. Based on the observed data approach, 216 (80.3%) were in quiescence (no 
active inflammatory lesions, AC cell grade ≤ 0.5+, VH grade ≤ 0.5+) with a concomitant steroid dose 
≤ 7.5 mg per day, and 178 (66.2%) were in steroid-free quiescence. BCVA was either improved or 
maintained (< 5 letters deterioration) in 88.6% of the eyes at week 78. Data beyond week 78 were 
generally consistent with these results but the number of enrolled subjects declined after this time. 
Overall, among the patients who discontinued the study, 18% discontinued due to adverse events, and 
8% due to insufficient response to adalimumab treatment.

Quality of life 
Patient reported outcomes regarding vision-related functioning were measured in both clinical studies, 
using the NEI VFQ-25. Adalimumab was numerically favoured for the majority of subscores with 
statistically significant mean differences for general vision, ocular pain, near vision, mental health, and 
total score in study UV I, and for general vision and mental health in study UV II. vision related 
effects were not numerically in favour of adalimumab for colour vision in study UVI and for colour 
vision, peripheral vision and near vision in study UV II. 
Immunogenicity  
Anti-adalimumab antibodies may develop during adalimumab treatment. Formation of anti-
adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. 
There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the 
occurrence of adverse events.  
Paediatric population 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)  
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)  
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (pJIA I and II) in children with 
active polyarticular or polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who had a variety of JIA onset 
types (most frequently rheumatoid-factor negative or positive polyarthritis and extended 
oligoarthritis).  
pJIA-I  
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
parallel-group study in 171 children (4-17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. In the open-label lead in 
phase (OL LI) patients were stratified into two groups, MTX (methotrexate)-treated or non-MTX-
treated. Patients who were in the non-MTX stratum were either naïve to or had been withdrawn from 
MTX at least two weeks prior to study drug administration. Patients remained on stable doses of non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and or prednisone (≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day 
maximum). In the OL LI phase all patients received 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg adalimumab 
every other week for 16 weeks. The distribution of patients by age and minimum, median and 
maximum dose received during the OL LI phase is presented in table 25.

Patients demonstrating a paediatric ACR 30 response at week 16 were eligible to be randomised into 
the double blind (DB) phase and received either adalimumab 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg, or 
placebo every other week for an additional 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare criteria were 
defined as a worsening of ≥ 30% from baseline in ≥ 3 of 6 paediatric ACR core criteria, ≥ 2 active 
joints, and improvement of > 30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at disease 
flare, patients were eligible to enrol into the open-label extension phase.

Amongst those who responded at week 16 (n = 144), the paediatric ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were 
maintained for up to six years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the 
study. Over all 19 subjects, of which 11 of the baseline age group 4 to 12 and 8 of the baseline age 
group 13 to 17 years were treated 6 years or longer.  
Overall responses were generally better and, fewer patients developed antibodies when treated with 
the combination of adalimumab and MTX compared to adalimumab alone. Taking these results into 
consideration, adalimumab is recommended for use in combination with MTX and for use as 
monotherapy in patients for whom MTX use is not appropriate (see section 4.2). 
pJIA II 
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicentre study in 32 children 
(2 - < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg) with moderately to severely active 
polyarticular JIA. The patients received 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a 
maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single dose via SC injection for at least 24 weeks. During 
the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or 
NSAIDs. 
At week 12 and week 24, PedACR30 response was 93.5% and 90.0%, respectively, using the observed 
data approach. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at week 12 and week 24 were 
90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Amongst those who responded 
(paediatric ACR 30) at week 24 (n = 27 out of 30 patients), the paediatric ACR 30 responses were 
maintained for up to 60 weeks in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout this 
time period. Overall, 20 subjects were treated for 60 weeks or longer. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study 
in 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were 
randomised to receive either 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) of adalimumab up to a maximum of 
40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The double-blind period is followed by an open-
label (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m2 BSA of adalimumab up to a maximum of 
40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was 
the percent change from baseline to week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not 
due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with 
mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the adalimumab 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. 
Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through 
week 156 for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the adalimumab group who remained in the study. 
Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in 
secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count 
(SJC), paediatric ACR 50 response, and paediatric ACR 70 response. 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis  
The efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, controlled study of 
114 paediatric patients from 4 years of age with severe chronic plaque psoriasis (as defined by a PGA 
≥ 4 or > 20% BSA involvement or > 10% BSA involvement with very thick lesions or PASI ≥ 20 or 
≥ 10 with clinically relevant facial, genital, or hand/foot involvement) who were inadequately 
controlled with topical therapy and heliotherapy or phototherapy. 
Patients received adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg every other week (up to 40 mg), 0.4 mg/kg every other week 
(up to 20 mg), or methotrexate 0.1–0.4 mg/kg weekly (up to 25 mg). At week 16, more patients 
randomised to adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg had positive efficacy responses (e.g. PASI 75) than those 
randomised to 0.4 mg/kg every other week or MTX.

Patients who achieved PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal were withdrawn from treatment for up to 
36 weeks and monitored for loss of disease control (i.e. a worsening of PGA by at least 2 grades). 
Patients were then retreated with adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg every other week for an additional 16 weeks 
and response rates observed during retreatment were similar to the previous double-blind period: PASI 
75 response of 78.9% (15 of 19 subjects) and PGA clear or minimal of 52.6% (10 of 19 subjects).  
In the open-label period of the study, PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal responses were maintained 
for up to an additional 52 weeks with no new safety findings. 
Adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa 
There are no clinical trials with adalimumab in adolescent patients with HS. Efficacy of adalimumab 
for the treatment of adolescent patients with HS is predicted based on the demonstrated efficacy and 
exposure-response relationship in adult HS patients and the likelihood that the disease course, 
pathophysiology, and drug effects are substantially similar to that of adults at the same exposure 
levels. Safety of the recommended adalimumab dose in the adolescent HS population is based on 
cross-indication safety profile of adalimumab in both adults and paediatric patients at similar or more 
frequent doses (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric Crohn’s disease  
Adalimumab was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction and maintenance treatment with doses dependent on body 
weight (< 40 kg or ≥ 40 kg) in 192 paediatric subjects between the ages of 6 and 17 (inclusive) years, 
with moderate to severe Crohn´s disease (CD) defined as Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index 
(PCDAI) score > 30. Subjects had to have failed conventional therapy (including a corticosteroid 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
and/or an immunomodulator) for CD. Subjects may also have previously lost response or been 
intolerant to infliximab.  
All subjects received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their baseline body weight: 
160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 for subjects ≥ 40 kg, and 80 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for 
subjects < 40 kg.  
At week 4, subjects were randomised 1:1 based on their body weight at the time to either the low dose 
or standard dose maintenance regimens as shown in table 28.

3 defined as a closure of all fistulas that were draining at baseline for at least 2 consecutive post-baseline visits  
Statistically significant increases (improvement) from baseline to week 26 and 52 in body mass index 
and height velocity were observed for both treatment groups.  
Statistically and clinically significant improvements from baseline were also observed in both 
treatment groups for quality of life parameters (including IMPACT III). 
One hundred patients (n = 100) from the Paediatric CD Study continued in an open-label long-term 
extension study. After 5 years of adalimumab therapy, 74.0% (37/50) of the 50 patients remaining in 
the study continued to be in clinical remission, and 92.0% (46/50) of patients continued to be in 
clinical response per PCDAI. 
Paediatric ulcerative colitis 
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, trial 
in 93 paediatric patients from 5 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo 
score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy) who 
had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy. Approximately 16% of patients in 
the study had failed prior anti-TNF treatment. Patients who received corticosteroids at enrollment were 
allowed to taper their corticosteroid therapy after week 4. 
In the induction period of the study, 77 patients were randomised 3:2 to receive double-blind treatment 
with adalimumab at an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at week 0 and week 1, and 
1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at week 2; or an induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) 
at week 0, placebo at week 1, and 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at week 2. Both groups received 
0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) at week 4 and week 6. Following an amendment to the study design, 
the remaining 16 patients who enrolled in the induction period received open-label treatment with 
adalimumab at the induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at week 0 and week 1, and 
1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at week 2. 
At week 8, 62 patients who demonstrated clinical response per Partial Mayo Score (PMS; defined as a 
decrease in PMS ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline) were randomised equally to receive double-
blind maintenance treatment with adalimumab at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every 
week, or a maintenance dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every other week. Prior to an 
amendment to the study design, 12 additional patients who demonstrated clinical response per PMS 
were randomised to receive placebo but were not included in the confirmatory analysis of efficacy. 
Disease flare was defined as an increase in PMS of at least 3 points (for patients with PMS of 0 to 2 at 
week 8), at least 2 points (for patients with PMS of 3 to 4 at week 8), or at least 1 point (for patients 
with PMS of 5 to 6 at week 8). 
Patients who met criteria for disease flare at or after week 12 were randomised to receive a re-
induction dose of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) or a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) and 
continued to receive their respective maintenance dose regimen afterwards. 
Efficacy Results 
The co-primary endpoints of the study were clinical remission per PMS (defined as PMS ≤ 2 and no 
individual subscore > 1) at week 8, and clinical remission per FMS (Full Mayo Score) (defined as a 
Mayo Score ≤ 2 and no individual subscore > 1) at week 52 in patients who achieved clinical response 
per PMS at Week 8. 
Clinical remission rates per PMS at week 8 for patients in each of the adalimumab double-blind 
induction groups are presented in table 31.

Quality of life 
Clinically meaningful improvements from Baseline were observed in IMPACT III and the caregiver 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) scores for the groups treated with adalimumab. 
Clinically meaningful increases (improvement) from Baseline in height velocity were observed for the 
groups treated with adalimumab, and clinically meaningful increases (improvement) from Baseline in 
Body Mass Index were observed for subjects on the high maintenance dose of maximum 40 mg 
(0.6 mg/kg) every week. 
Paediatric uveitis 
The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in a randomised, double-masked, controlled 
study of 90 paediatric patients from 2 to < 18 years of age with active JIA-associated noninfectious 
anterior uveitis who were refractory to at least 12 weeks of methotrexate treatment. Patients received 
either placebo or 20 mg adalimumab (if < 30 kg) or 40 mg adalimumab (if ≥ 30 kg) every other week 
in combination with their baseline dose of methotrexate. 
The primary endpoint was ‘time to treatment failure’. The criteria determining treatment failure were 
worsening or sustained non-improvement in ocular inflammation, partial improvement with 
development of sustained ocular co-morbidities or worsening of ocular co-morbidities, non-permitted 
use of concomitant medications, and suspension of treatment for an extended period of time.

Clinical Response 
Adalimumab significantly delayed the time to treatment failure, as compared to placebo (see figure 3, 
P < 0.0001 from log rank test). The median time to treatment failure was 24.1 weeks for subjects 
treated with placebo, whereas the median time to treatment failure was not estimable for subjects 
treated with adalimumab because less than one-half of these subjects experienced treatment failure. 
Adalimumab significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure by 75% relative to placebo, as shown 
by the hazard ratio (HR = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.49]).

5.2   Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption and distribution  
After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab 
was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration. The 
average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies conducted with the 
reference product following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. After single intravenous 
doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg, concentrations were dose proportional. After doses of 0.5 mg/kg 
(~40 mg), clearances ranged from 11 to 15 mL/hour, the distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 5 to 
6 litres and the mean terminal phase half-life was approximately two weeks. Adalimumab

concentrations in the synovial fluid from several rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31-96% of 
those in serum.  
Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 μg/mL 
(without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 μg/mL (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively. 
The serum adalimumab trough levels at steady-state increased roughly proportionally with dose 
following 20, 40 and 80 mg subcutaneous dosing every other week and every week.  
Following the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to 
patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough 
steady-state (values measured from week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 
5.6 ± 5.6 μg/mL (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 10.9 ± 5.2 μg/mL 
(47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.  
In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing < 15 kg 
dosed with adalimumab 24 mg/m2, the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations 
was 6.0 ± 6.1 µg/mL (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 
7.9 ± 5.6 µg/mL (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate. 
Following the administration of 24 mg/m2 (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to 
patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steady-state (values 
measured at week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 µg/mL for adalimumab 
without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 µg/mL with concomitant methotrexate. 
Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of adalimumab every other week in adult non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state concentration at 
week 68 was 8.0 ± 4.6 g/ml. 
In adult patients with psoriasis, the mean steady-state trough concentration was 5 μg/mL during 
adalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.  
Following the administration of 0.8 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to 
paediatric patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, the mean ± SD steady-state adalimumab trough 
concentration was approximately 7.4 ± 5.8 μg/mL (79% CV). 
In adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, a dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 
80 mg on week 2 achieved serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 7 to 8 μg/mL at 
week 2 and week 4. The mean steady-state trough concentration at week 12 through week 36 were 
approximately 8 to 10 μg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every week treatment.  
Adalimumab exposure in adolescent HS patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic 
modelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients 
(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related 
arthritis). The recommended adolescent HS dosing schedule is 40 mg every other week. Since 
exposure to adalimumab can be affected by body size, adolescents with higher body weight and 
inadequate response may benefit from receiving the recommended adult dose of 40 mg every week. 
In patients with Crohn’s disease, the loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg 
adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 
5.5 μg/mL during the induction period. A loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 
80 mg adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 
12 μg/mL during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 μg/mL 
were observed in Crohn’s disease patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab 
every other week. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In paediatric patients with moderate to severe CD, the open-label adalimumab induction dose was 
160/80 mg or 80/40 mg at weeks 0 and 2, respectively, dependent on a body weight cut-off of 40 kg. 
At week 4, patients were randomised 1:1 to either the Standard Dose (40/20 mg every other week) or 
Low Dose (20/10 mg every other week) maintenance treatment groups based on their body weight. 
The mean (±SD) serum adalimumab trough concentrations achieved at week 4 were 15.7 ± 6.6 μg/mL 
for patients ≥ 40 kg (160/80 mg) and 10.6 ± 6.1 μg/mL for patients < 40 kg (80/40 mg).  
For patients who stayed on their randomised therapy, the mean (±SD) adalimumab trough 
concentrations at week 52 were 9.5 ± 5.6 μg/mL for the standard dose group and 3.5 ± 2.2 μg/mL for 
the low dose group. The mean trough concentrations were maintained in patients who continued to 
receive adalimumab treatment every other week for 52 weeks. For patients who dose escalated from 
every other week to weekly regimen, the mean (±SD) serum concentrations of adalimumab at week 52 
were 15.3 ± 11.4 μg/mL (40/20 mg, weekly) and 6.7 ± 3.5 μg/mL (20/10 mg, weekly).  
In patients with ulcerative colitis, a loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 80 mg 
adalimumab on week 2 achieves serum adalimumab trough concentrations of approximately 12 μg/mL 
during the induction period. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 8 μg/mL were observed 
in ulcerative colitis patients who received a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week. 
Following the subcutaneous administration of body weight-based dosing of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 
40 mg) every other week to paediatric patients with ulcerative colitis, the mean trough steady-state 
serum adalimumab concentration was 5.01 ± 3.28 μg/ml at week 52. For patients who received 
0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) every week, the mean (±SD) trough steady-state serum adalimumab 
concentration was 15.7 ± 5.60 μg/ml at week 52. 
In adult patients with uveitis, a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab on week 0 followed by 40 mg 
adalimumab every other week starting at week 1, resulted in mean steady-state concentrations of 
approximately 8 to 10 μg/mL. 
Adalimumab exposure in paediatric uveitis patients was predicted using population pharmacokinetic 
modelling and simulation based on cross-indication pharmacokinetics in other paediatric patients 
(paediatric psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, paediatric Crohn’s disease, and enthesitis-related 
arthritis). No clinical exposure data are available on the use of a loading dose in children < 6 years. 
The predicted exposures indicate that in the absence of methotrexate, a loading dose may lead to an 
initial increase in systemic exposure. 
Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation 
predicted comparable adalimumab exposure and efficacy in patients treated with 80 mg every other 
week when compared with 40 mg every week (including adult patients with RA, HS, UC, CD or Ps, 
patients with adolescent HS, and paediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with CD and UC). 
Exposure-response relationship in paediatric population 
On the basis of clinical trial data in patients with JIA (pJIA and ERA), an exposure-response 
relationship was established between plasma concentrations and PedACR 50 response. The apparent 
adalimumab plasma concentration that produces half the maximum probability of PedACR 50 
response (EC50) was 3 μg/ml (95% CI: 1-6 μg/ml). 
Exposure-response relationships between adalimumab concentration and efficacy in paediatric patients 
with severe chronic plaque psoriasis were established for PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal, 
respectively. PASI 75 and PGA clear or minimal increased with increasing adalimumab 
concentrations, both with a similar apparent EC50 of approximately 4.5 μg/mL (95% CI 0.4-47.6 and 
1.9-10.5, respectively). 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses with data from over 1,300 RA patients revealed a trend toward 
higher apparent clearance of adalimumab with increasing body weight. After adjustment for weight 
differences, gender and age appeared to have a minimal effect on adalimumab clearance. The serum 
levels of free adalimumab (not bound to anti-adalimumab antibodies, AAA) were observed to be 
lower in patients with measurable AAA.  
Hepatic or renal impairment  
Adalimumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  
5.3   Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of single dose toxicity, 
repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity.  
An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity/perinatal developmental study has been performed in 
Cynomolgus monkeys at 0, 30 and 100 mg/kg (9-17 monkeys/group) and has revealed no evidence of 
harm to the foetuses due to adalimumab. Neither carcinogenicity studies, nor a standard assessment of 
fertility and postnatal toxicity, were performed with adalimumab due to the lack of appropriate models 
for an antibody with limited cross-reactivity to rodent TNF and to the development of neutralising 
antibodies in rodents.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What AMGEVITA is and what it is used for 
AMGEVITA contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body’s immune 
(defence) system.  
AMGEVITA is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Plaque psoriasis  
Hidradenitis suppurativa 
Crohn’s disease  
Ulcerative colitis 
Non-infectious uveitis 
The active ingredient in AMGEVITA, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target.  
The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the 
immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. 
By attaching to TNFα, AMGEVITA decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. 
If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to treat your 
rheumatoid arthritis.  
AMGEVITA can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without 
previous methotrexate treatment. 
AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and 
to improve physical function.  
Usually, AMGEVITA is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is 
inappropriate, AMGEVITA can be given alone. 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis  
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of 
the joints that usually first appear in childhood.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years and 
enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years. You may first be given other disease-modifying 
medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given AMGEVITA to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.  
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis  
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to 
reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  
Psoriatic arthritis  
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the 
cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  
Plaque psoriasis in adults and children 
Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery 
scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift 
away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the 
body’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. AMGEVITA is also used 
to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical 
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable.

Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory 
skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. 
It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner 
thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
AMGEVITA can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA. 
Crohn’s disease in adults and children  
Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have 
Crohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease.  
Ulcerative colitis in adults and children  
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to 17 
years. If you have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your 
disease. 
Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children 
Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat 
• 
• 
Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye.  
Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting 
the front of the eye. 
This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black 
dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). AMGEVITA works by reducing this 
inflammation. 
2.  What you need to know before you use AMGEVITA 
Do not use AMGEVITA: 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood infection) or other 
opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) (see 
“Warnings and precautions”). It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of 
infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems.  
if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AMGEVITA: 
Allergic reactions 
- 
If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash do not inject more AMGEVITA and contact your doctor immediately since, in 
rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening.  
Infections 
- 
- 
If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) 
consult your doctor before starting AMGEVITA. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. 
You might get infections more easily while you are receiving AMGEVITA treatment. This risk 
may increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include 
tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic 
infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your 
doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor 
may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA.  
Tuberculosis 
- 
- 
- 
As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor 
will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting AMGEVITA. This will 
include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening 
tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests 
should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your 
doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis.  
Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for 
tuberculosis.  
If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other 
infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately.  
Travel / recurrent infection 
- 
- 
Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  
Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase 
the risk of infections.  
Hepatitis B virus 
- 
Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV 
or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. 
AMGEVITA can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, 
especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of 
HBV can be life-threatening.  
Age over 65 years 
- 
If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking AMGEVITA. 
You and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being 
treated with AMGEVITA. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, 
such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Surgery or dental procedures 
- 
If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are 
taking AMGEVITA. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA. 
Demyelinating disease 
- 
If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide 
if you should receive or continue to receive AMGEVITA. Tell your doctor immediately if you 
experience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness 
or tingling in any part of your body. 
Vaccinations 
- 
- 
Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that 
may cause infections and should not be given while receiving AMGEVITA. Please check with 
your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be 
brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines 
prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy.  
If you received AMGEVITA while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for 
getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last dose you received 
during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care 
professionals about your AMGEVITA use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your 
baby should receive any vaccine. 
Heart failure 
- 
If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with AMGEVITA, your heart failure 
status must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have 
had or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart 
failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor 
immediately. Your doctor will decide if you should receive AMGEVITA. 
Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale 
- 
In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body 
fight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, 
bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may 
decide to stop treatment. 
Cancer 
- 
- 
- 
There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking 
adalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had 
the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer 
that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone 
marrow).  
If you take AMGEVITA the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may 
increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in 
patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-
mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with 
AMGEVITA.  
In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking 
adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change 
appearance, tell your doctor. 
83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
There have been cases of cancers, other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung 
disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF 
blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor 
whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  
Autoimmune diseases 
- 
On rare occasions, treatment with AMGEVITA could result in lupus-like syndrome. Contact 
your doctor if symptoms such as persistent unexplained rash, fever, joint pain or tiredness occur. 
In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. 
Children and adolescents 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Vaccinations: if possible children should be up to date with all vaccinations before using 
AMGEVITA. 
Do not give AMGEVITA to children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis below the 
age of 2 years. 
Do not give AMGEVITA to children with plaque psoriasis below the age of 4 years. 
Do not give AMGEVITA to children with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis below the age of 
6 years.  
Other medicines and AMGEVITA  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
AMGEVITA can be taken together with methotrexate or certain disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
agents (sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide and injectable gold preparations), steroids or 
pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  
You should not take AMGEVITA with medicines containing the active substances, anakinra or 
abatacept due to increased risk of serious infection. If you have questions, please ask your doctor. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its 
use for at least 5 months after the last AMGEVITA treatment. 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice about taking this medicine. 
AMGEVITA should only be used during a pregnancy if needed. 
According to a pregnancy study, there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had 
received AMGEVITA during pregnancy compared with mothers with the same disease who did 
not receive AMGEVITA. 
AMGEVITA can be used during breast-feeding. 
If you receive AMGEVITA during your pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk for 
getting an infection. 
It is important that you tell your baby’s doctors and other health care professionals about your 
AMGEVITA use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. For more 
information on vaccines see the “Warnings and precautions” section.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What AMGEVITA is and what it is used for 
AMGEVITA contains the active substance adalimumab, a medicine that acts on your body’s immune 
(defence) system.  
AMGEVITA is intended for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases described below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Plaque psoriasis  
Hidradenitis suppurativa  
Crohn’s disease  
Ulcerative colitis 
Non-infectious uveitis  
The active ingredient in AMGEVITA, adalimumab, is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific target.  
The target of adalimumab is a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), which is involved in the 
immune (defence) system and is present at increased levels in the inflammatory diseases listed above. 
By attaching to TNFα, AMGEVITA decreases the process of inflammation in these diseases. 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rheumatoid arthritis  
Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. If you have moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis, you may first be given other disease-modifying medicines, such as methotrexate. 
If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to treat your 
rheumatoid arthritis.  
AMGEVITA can also be used to treat severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis without 
previous methotrexate treatment. 
AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and 
to improve physical function.  
Usually, AMGEVITA is used with methotrexate. If your doctor determines that methotrexate is 
inappropriate, AMGEVITA can be given alone. 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis are inflammatory diseases of 
the joints that usually first appear in childhood.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 2 years and 
enthesitis-related arthritis in patients from 6 years. You may first be given other disease-modifying 
medicines, such as methotrexate. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be 
given AMGEVITA to treat your polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis.  
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis  
Ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing 
spondylitis, are inflammatory diseases of the spine.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of ankylosing spondylitis in adults. If you have ankylosing spondylitis or axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of ankylosing spondylitis, you will first be given other 
medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to 
reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease.  
Psoriatic arthritis  
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammation of the joints associated with psoriasis.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat psoriatic arthritis in adults. AMGEVITA slows down the damage to the 
cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve physical function.  
Plaque psoriasis in adults and children 
Plaque psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery 
scales. Plaque psoriasis can also affect the nails, causing them to crumble, become thickened and lift 
away from the nail bed which can be painful. Psoriasis is believed to be caused by a problem with the 
body’s immune system that leads to an increased production of skin cells. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. AMGEVITA is also used 
to treat severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years for whom topical 
therapy and phototherapies have either not worked very well or are not suitable. 
102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (sometimes called acne inversa) is a chronic and often painful inflammatory 
skin disease. Symptoms may include tender nodules (lumps) and abscesses (boils) that may leak pus. 
It most commonly affects specific areas of the skin, such as under the breasts, the armpits, inner 
thighs, groin and buttocks. Scarring may also occur in affected areas. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
AMGEVITA can reduce the number of nodules and abscesses you have, and the pain that is often 
associated with the disease. You may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA. 
Crohn’s disease in adults and children  
Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat Crohn’s disease in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. If you have 
Crohn’s disease you will first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well enough to these 
medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your Crohn’s disease.  
Ulcerative colitis in adults and children  
Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine. 
AMGEVITA is used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults and children aged 6 to 17 
years. If you have ulcerative colitis you may first be given other medicines. If you do not respond well 
enough to these medicines, you will be given AMGEVITA to reduce the signs and symptoms of your 
disease. 
Non-infectious uveitis in adults and children 
Non-infectious uveitis is an inflammatory disease affecting certain parts of the eye.  
AMGEVITA is used to treat  
• 
• 
Adults with non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting the back of the eye. 
Children from 2 years of age with chronic non-infectious uveitis with inflammation affecting 
the front of the eye. 
This inflammation may lead to a decrease of vision and/or the presence of floaters in the eye (black 
dots or wispy lines that move across the field of vision). AMGEVITA works by reducing this 
inflammation. 
2.  What you need to know before you use AMGEVITA 
Do not use AMGEVITA: 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to adalimumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have a severe infection, including active tuberculosis, sepsis (blood infection) or other 
opportunistic infections (unusual infections associated with a weakened immune system) (see 
“Warnings and precautions”). It is important that you tell your doctor if you have symptoms of 
infections, e.g. fever, wounds, feeling tired, dental problems.  
if you have moderate or severe heart failure. It is important to tell your doctor if you have had or 
have a serious heart condition (see “Warnings and precautions”).  
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using AMGEVITA: 
Allergic reaction 
- 
If you experience allergic reactions with symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dizziness, 
swelling or rash do not inject more AMGEVITA and contact your doctor immediately since, in 
rare cases, these reactions can be life threatening. 
Infections 
- 
- 
If you have an infection, including long-term or localised infection (for example, leg ulcer) 
consult your doctor before starting AMGEVITA. If you are unsure, contact your doctor. 
You might get infections more easily while you are receiving AMGEVITA treatment. This risk 
may increase if your lung function is impaired. These infections may be serious and include 
tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi, parasites or bacteria, or other opportunistic 
infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. It is important to tell your 
doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. Your doctor 
may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA.  
Tuberculosis 
- 
- 
- 
As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with adalimumab, your doctor 
will check you for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting AMGEVITA. This will 
include a thorough medical evaluation including your medical history and appropriate screening 
tests (for example chest x-ray and a tuberculin test). The conduct and results of these tests 
should be recorded on your Patient Reminder Card. It is very important that you tell your 
doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis, or if you have been in close contact with someone who 
has had tuberculosis.  
Tuberculosis can develop during therapy even if you have received preventative treatment for 
tuberculosis.  
If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other 
infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately.  
Travel / recurrent infection 
- 
- 
Advise your doctor if you reside or travel in regions where fungal infections such as 
histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis are endemic.  
Advise your doctor if you have a history of recurrent infections or other conditions that increase 
the risk of infections.  
Hepatitis B virus 
- 
Advise your doctor if you are a carrier of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), if you have active HBV 
or if you think you might be at risk of contracting HBV. Your doctor should test you for HBV. 
AMGEVITA can cause reactivation of HBV in people who carry this virus. In some rare cases, 
especially if you are taking other medicines that suppress the immune system, reactivation of 
HBV can be life-threatening.  
Age over 65 years 
- 
If you are over 65 years you may be more susceptible to infections while taking AMGEVITA. 
You and your doctor should pay special attention to signs of infection while you are being 
treated with AMGEVITA. It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms of infections, 
such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. 
104 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Surgery or dental procedures 
- 
If you are about to undergo surgery or dental procedures please inform your doctor that you are 
taking AMGEVITA. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of AMGEVITA. 
Demyelinating disease 
- 
If you have or develop demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, your doctor will decide 
if you should receive or continue to receive AMGEVITA. Tell your doctor immediately if you 
experience symptoms like changes in your vision, weakness in your arms or legs or numbness 
or tingling in any part of your body. 
Vaccinations 
- 
- 
Certain vaccines contain living but weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses that 
may cause infections and should not be given while receiving AMGEVITA. Please check with 
your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be 
brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines 
prior to initiating AMGEVITA therapy.  
If you received AMGEVITA while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for 
getting such an infection for up to approximately five months after the last dose you received 
during pregnancy. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other health care 
professionals about your AMGEVITA use during your pregnancy so they can decide when your 
baby should receive any vaccine. 
Heart failure 
- 
If you have mild heart failure and you are being treated with AMGEVITA, your heart failure 
status must be closely monitored by your doctor. It is important to tell your doctor if you have 
had or have a serious heart condition. If you develop new or worsening symptoms of heart 
failure (e.g. shortness of breath, or swelling of your feet), you must contact your doctor 
immediately. Your doctor will decide if you should receive AMGEVITA. 
Fever, bruising, bleeding or looking pale 
- 
In some patients the body may fail to produce enough of the blood cells that help your body 
fight infections or help you to stop bleeding. If you develop a fever that does not go away, 
bruise or bleed very easily or look very pale, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may 
decide to stop treatment. 
Cancer 
- 
- 
- 
There have been very rare cases of certain kinds of cancer in children and adult patients taking 
adalimumab or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had 
the disease for a long time may have a higher than average risk of getting lymphoma (a cancer 
that affects the lymph system), and leukaemia (a cancer that affects the blood and bone 
marrow).  
If you take AMGEVITA the risk of getting lymphoma, leukaemia, or other cancers may 
increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in 
patients taking adalimumab. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-
mercaptopurine. Tell your doctor if you are taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with 
AMGEVITA.  
In addition, cases of non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in patients taking 
adalimumab. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change 
appearance, tell your doctor. 
105

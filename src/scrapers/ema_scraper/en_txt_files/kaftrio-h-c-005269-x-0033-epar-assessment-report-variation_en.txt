2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Currently, Kaftrio tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
The new claimed indication reads as follows: 
Kaftrio granules are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) 
in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and high 
premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that result 
in an absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial 
chloride channel responsible for regulating salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate 
chloride transport results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. 
In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein results in the accumulation of 
thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal 
absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. 
Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. 
F508del is the most common disease-causing mutation (84.7% of individuals in the US and 81.1% of 
individuals in Europe). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and screening tools  
CF affects approximately 3,000 individuals in the US and a total of 54,000 in the EU in the registries included. 
1,2 The number of adults with CF continues to increase, while the number of children remains relatively 
stable. In 2021, adults were 58.3 percent of the CF population, compared with 32.7 percent in 1991.1 The 
incidence and prevalence of CF vary between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the 
Caucasian populations of North America and Europe than in Asian and African populations. In the US, the 
median age at death was 33.9 years for the people with CF who were reported to have died in 2021. About 
11 percent of deaths occurred before 20 years of age. A comparison of the cumulative percentage for age at 
death between 1991 and 2021 shows a substantial shift of the curve toward the right with a larger proportion 
of deaths occurring at older ages. For individuals born between 2017 and 2021, the median predicted survival 
age was 53.1 years (95 percent confidence interval: 51.6 - 54.7 years).   
2.1.1.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride ion (Cl-) channel located in the epithelia of multiple organs, 
including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, liver, and vas deferens, responsible for aiding in the regulation of 
salt and water absorption and secretion. More than 2000 mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified.

CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms that disrupt CFTR function. 
• Class I mutations: Defective protein production 
• Class II mutations: Defective protein processing 
• Class III mutations: Defective regulation 
• Class IV mutations: Defective chloride conduction 
• Class V mutations: Reduced amounts of functional CFTR protein (less transcription) 
Class I, II and III usually lead to a classic (severe) CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. 
Class IV and V are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of phenylalanine at 
position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del-CFTR), which is considered a Class II mutation: it prevents most of 
the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface, resulting in little-to-no chloride transport. The decrease in 
the amount of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface is due to a defect in the processing and trafficking of the 
F508del-CFTR protein. The very small amount of F508del-CFTR protein that reaches the cell surface also has 
defective channel gating and decreased stability at the cell surface. Patients who are homozygous with 
F508del-CFTR defects have little or no CFTR protein at the cell surface and hence suffer from a severe form 
of CF disease. 
More than 2000 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified. Most of the CFTR gene mutations are not 
associated with CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 database (an online resource that provides 
clinical and nonclinical data about CF-associated CFTR mutations) contains information on 412 of these 
identified mutations, with sufficient evidence to define 346 mutations as disease-causing. 
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport caused 
by the mutation. In general, a complete or near-complete loss of CFTR chloride is referred to as “minimal 
function” of CFTR (class I, II and III). A residual CFTR-mediated chloride transport is referred to as “residual 
function” of CFTR (class IV and V). 
2.1.2.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across epithelia in various tissues, 
including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Decreased CFTR quantity 
or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues leading to the multisystem 
pathology associated with CF. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality. The clinical 
manifestations are those of progressive airway obstruction and bronchiectasis, with periods of worsening 
pulmonary symptoms associated with a decline in pulmonary function and increased bacterial density in 
airway secretions (pulmonary exacerbations). Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of a 
chronic bacterial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory responses are all thought to play a role 
in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. In addition, poor growth 
and nutritional status have historically been common in patients with CF owing to a number of factors, 
including pancreatic insufficiency-related fat malabsorption, increased energy expenditure attributable to 
progressive lung disease, appetite suppression attributable to chronic infection, and CF-related diabetes. 
These signs and symptoms are the typical manifestations of CF, and generally occur in advanced form in 
older paediatric and adult CF patients. However, less severe form of the above-mentioned manifestations of 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 11/80 
 
 
  
 
the disease can be observed in early childhood or – in patients with severe genotypes (with gating mutations 
such as G551D) – in infancy or even in utero. In CF patients with gating mutations pancreatic destruction 
leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency begins in utero, and lung involvement, manifested by pulmonary 
inflammation and infection, begins shortly after birth. 
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and poor nutritional status are among the most significant clinical 
manifestations of CF in infants with severe genotypes. These factors often lead to poor growth with 
subsequent growth delay, poorer cognitive development, and are associated with other clinical comorbidities 
such as decreased lung function and decreased survival. Malnourishment is associated with worsening lung 
function in children with CF and is an independent predictor of mortality in this population. In one study, fat 
malabsorption was present in 79% of infants tested at 6 months and 92% of infants by 12 months of age. 
Additionally, increased energy expenditure and appetite suppression due to lung disease contribute to poor 
somatic growth and poor nutritional status in young patients with CF. 
Since the introduction and continued advances of newborn and antenatal screening, many patients with CF 
are identified through a positive screening test and subsequently diagnosed within the first year of life. 
Approximately 65% of patients in the ECFSPR 2020 Annual Report are diagnosed by 1 year of age, with a 
median (min., max.) age at diagnosis of 0.30 (0.00, 82.57) years. Data in the literature suggest that early 
therapeutic intervention is beneficial to children with CF; studies have demonstrated benefits such as 
improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by 
newborn screening. Therefore, it is expected that the initiation of treatment with CFTR modulators targeting 
the functional defects of the mutated CFTR protein could postpone or even prevent the onset of clinical 
manifestations of cystic fibrosis such as lung disease and impaired exocrine pancreatic function 
In Europe, the median age of all CF patients was 18.5 years (with the youngest patient being diagnosed just 
after birth and the oldest patients being 88.4 years of age) in 2017. Despite advances in treatment, the 
current median age of death in a patient with CF is approximately 31 years. In 2018, the median predicted 
survival age of those born in 2018 was 47.4 years (95% CI: 44.2–50.3 years)1. Such a prediction assumes 
no further improvement in mortality rate and thus does not consider the potential impact of CFTR modulators 
and other improvements in clinical care. 
CF is diagnosed when both of the following criteria are met: 
•  Clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system (CLASSIC), or positive newborn 
screening or genetic testing for siblings of patients with CF 
AND 
•  Evidence of CFTR dysfunction (any of the following): 
o  Elevated sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L (CLASSIC) 
o  Presence of two disease-causing mutations in CFTR, one from each parental allele 
o  Abnormal nasal potential difference 
Around 2 % of patients lack one or more of the “CLASSIC” features. They may have milder clinical symptoms 
and/or normal to intermediate sweat chloride results. These patients can still be diagnosed with CF if they 
meet genetic or functional criteria.

2.1.3.  Management 
Existing treatments for CF can be broadly classified into 2 groups: (1) therapies that manage the symptoms, 
complications, and comorbidities of the disease (e.g., antibiotics, mucolytics, pancreatic enzyme replacement 
therapy) and (2) CFTR modulators (i.e., correctors and potentiators) which target the underlying cause of the 
disease. Concomitant administrations of these two groups are recommended to maintain and improve lung 
function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and improve quality of life.  
(1)  CF therapies currently available, including nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics, target 
the downstream consequences and symptoms of the disease. These therapies are predominantly 
generic medicines authorized at a national level, apart from agents for the management of chronic 
pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
(2)  CFTR modulators are small molecules that target specific defects caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene. Correctors (tezacaftor, lumacaftor and elexacaftor) facilitate the cellular processing and 
trafficking of CFTR to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators (ivacaftor) 
increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the 
cell surface to enhance chloride transport. A combination of a corrector and a potentiator should 
result in sufficient levels of CFTR at the surface, which is then enhanced for its gating function. Kaftrio 
(elexacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor), Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, 
LUM/IVA), and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved for CF 
patients with specific mutations. 
It is believed that if a CFTR modulator regimen had a large enough effect on F508del-CFTR, then the 
presence of a single F508del allele alone would be sufficient to derive significant clinical benefit. That single 
regimen would be effective in all patients with at least one F508del allele, regardless of the mutation on the 
second allele. If the second allele is also responsive, any benefit derived from that allele would be in addition 
to the benefit derived from the effect on F508del-CFTR. Importantly, for patients who have one F508del allele 
and are currently being treated with CFTR modulators (i.e. F/G and F/RF patients), their F508del allele seems 
not being fully leveraged because approved regimens primarily target the gating (IVA) or RF (IVA and 
TEZ/IVA) allele with limited modulation of the single F508del allele; these patients too would benefit from 
additional, highly effective modulation of their F508del. 
2.2.  About the product 
Kaftrio belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of other respiratory system products with ATC code 
R07AX32. Kaftrio is a triple combination product that contains the CFTR modulators elexacaftor, ivacaftor and 
tezacaftor. 
Tezacaftor, as CFTR corrector, facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR (including F508del-
CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, resulting in increased 
chloride transport. Ivacaftor, as a CFTR potentiator, potentiates the channel- open probability (or gating) of 
CFTR at the cell surface to increase chloride transport. Elexacaftor, as a next-generation CFTR corrector, also 
facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR. The product is considered to have a different 
chemical structure and a different mechanism of action as the first generations of CFTR correctors (TEZ, LUM) 
and potentiator (IVA). 
The combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor results in increased quantity and function of CFTR at 
the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport, airway surface liquid height, and ciliary beat 
frequency. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023

Kaftrio is already registered for patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least 
one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application is an extension of the marketing authorisation to add a new pharmaceutical form including a 
new indication. 
Currently, the applicant is applying to register the addition of a new oral granules in sachet dosage form of 
the triple combination of elexacaftor (ELX), tezacaftor (TEZ), and ivacaftor (IVA), grouped with a Type II 
variation to expand the indication of KAFTRIO to patients aged 2 to less than 6 years. 
The two proposed dosing strengths for KAFTRIO granules are (1) ELX/TEZ/IVA 100/50/75 mg fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) granules, and (2) ELX/TEZ/IVA 80/40/60 mg FDC granules. 
For the proposed use in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the age- and weight-adapted dosing 
of ELX/TEZ/IVA combinations therapy is proposed as follows:

The dose is to be taken approximately 12 hours apart. Both Kaftrio and ivacaftor tablets should be taken with 
fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks containing fat are those prepared with butter or oils or 
eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats. 
In the development of Kaftrio "minimal function" mutations (MF) are defined as mutations that produce (1) 
no CFTR protein or (2) a CFTR protein that is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro (comparable to Class 
I). 
The populations described in the report are according to the definitions in the clinical development of Kaftrio: 
o  Homozygous for F508del (F/F) 
o  Heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF) 
o  Heterozygous for F508del and a gating mutation (F/G) 
o  Heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation (F/RF)

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The scope of this application is to introduce a new pharmaceutical form, granules in sachet, in 2 strengths, in 
addition to the already authorised film coated tablets, to support an extension of indication to paediatric 
patients. 
The finished product is presented as granules in sachet in 2 strengths containing 60 mg of ivacaftor, 40 mg of 
tezacaftor and 80 mg of elexacaftor , or 75 mg of ivacaftor, 50 mg of tezacaftor and 100 mg of elexacaftor, 
as active substances.  
Other ingredients are colloidal anhydrous silica (E551), croscarmellose sodium (E468), hypromellose, 
hypromellose acetate succinate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate (E470b), mannitol (E421), 
sodium laurilsulfate, and sucralose (E955). 
The product is available in biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate/polyethylene/foil/polyethylene 
(BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) printed foil laminate sachet, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The finished product contains three active substances: ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor. The granules in 
sachet are a line extension of the already authorised product Kaftrio film-coated tablets containing the same 
active substances. No module 3.2.S has been submitted for this line extension. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished products consists of white to off-white, sweetened, unflavoured immediate-release granules for 
oral administration. The granules are a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the active ingredients ivacaftor, 
tezacaftor and elexacaftor. Both ivacaftor and tezacaftor active substances are included in the formulation as 
amorphous spray-dried dispersion (SDD) intermediates, whereas elexacaftor is provided as crystalline solid. 
This is the same as in the authorised Kaftrio tablets. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur., USP and 
USP/NF standards with the exception of a process solvent, removed during the manufacturing process, which 
is controlled to an in-house standard. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The list of excipients is listed in Section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Granules have a nominal diameter of 2 mm and an approximate thickness of 2 mm. The granules are filled by 
count into the primary container (single dose foil sachet) to the target strength. For administration, the 
granules are emptied from the sachet and mixed with a small amount of soft food. 
The granules formulations have been developed for use in children. Due to the low aqueous solubility of 
ivacaftor and insufficient stability of the amorphous ivacaftor in aqueous media, neither a solution nor a 
suspension formulation is feasible. Therefore, a granule dosage form was developed for ease of 
administration. 
The formulation development was mainly based on the existing Kalydeco (ivacaftor) granules from the same 
MAH. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. All excipients used in Kaftrio granules are also 
used in Kaftrio tablets with exception of mannitol and sucralose, which were added to enhance the sensory 
attributes and palatability of the formulation when mixed with soft foods, as was done for Kalydeco granules. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 15/80 
 
 
  
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. Chemical and physical compatibility of the active substances with the excipients was 
confirmed by placing the granules in an open dish study at 40 °C/ 75% RH for 3 months. 
Both granules strengths are manufactured from the same compression blend/granules. The amount of 
granules filled into the sachet makes up the strength of the product. 
A detailed discussion on the age-appropriateness of the finished product for use in children of 2-6 years in 
line with the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use was not provided in 
the quality part of the dossier. However, no direct safety issues are foreseen with regard to the excipients 
and their quantities in the formulation for use in children. All excipients have been used previously in the 
intended age group (i.e. Kalydeco granules). Furthermore, the proposed Kaftrio granules are the same size 
as the approved Kalydeco granules and are indicated for use in children from 4 months of age; hence no 
difficulties with swallowing are expected.  
The palatability of the granules and the formulation was developed to perform similarly to the tablets. The 
granules will be dosed in a small amount of food. The compatibility of the finished product with different 
foods has been demonstrated in P.2.6. Briefly, chemical and physical stability of granules mixed with small 
volumes (~5 mL) of selected liquids and soft foods were evaluated by testing assay, degradation products, 
dissolution, and physical form. The results at 2 hours after mixing the Kaftrio granules with water, apple 
juice, carrot puree, and whole milk yogurt demonstrated acceptable chemical stability. The results support 
the administration of the granules in food. 
Therefore, in the SmPC it is described that the entire contents of one sachet should be mixed with one 
teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and the mixture completely consumed. A statement on 
the stability of one hour after mixing is included as well. These instructions are the same as for the Kalydeco 
granules and are acceptable.  
The batches used in the clinical studies were manufactured according to the finalized manufacturing process 
and composition and are representative for the commercial product. 
The proposed dissolution methods for ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are based on the dissolution 
methods for the three active substances in the Kaftrio tablets. The proposed dissolution methods are 
acceptable. 
Extensive studies have been carried out to demonstrate the discriminatory power of the methods. 
Discriminatory power has been shown for the dissolution methods for elexacaftor and tezacaftor. Although 
the ivacaftor dissolution method was not shown to be able to discriminate with respect to the studied 
changes in granules material/granule attributes and process parameters, the same dissolution method has 
been approved for the currently registered Kaftrio tablets and therefore is accepted. 
Product and process development was conducted under a Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm. The QTPP is 
shown below: 
Table 2: Quality Target Product Profile for Kaftrio granules 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 16/80 
 
 
  
 
The ELX/TEZ/IVA granules CQAs for the granules are: appearance, identification, assay, degradation 
products, dissolution, content uniformity, physical form, residual solvents, microbial attributes, elemental 
impurities, and chiral purity 
The manufacturing process development and development studies performed were guided by an initial risk 
assessment where the potential impact of material attributes and process steps that could potentially impact 
the CQAs were evaluated.  
QbD experiments have been performed for several manufacturing steps. DOEs were subsequently used to 
design multivariate experiments to evaluate main effects and interactions on the CQAs. These experiments 
considered the desired manufacturing range (DMR) as well as incoming material specification and equipment 
capability. Experimental designs were conducted for the blending, lubrication, and compression unit 
operations. Information on in-process controls has been supplied. 
The primary packaging is a biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate/polyethylene/foil/polyethylene 
(BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) printed foil laminate sachet. The materials comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 
10/2011 for food contact materials. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The granules are manufactured by a direct compression process. The manufacturing process comprises three 
steps: blending blending, compression and sachet filling. The manufacturing process is a standard process. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail including the equipment type(s) for each 
unit operation, equipment working capacity, where appropriate, and process parameters (CPP and non-CPP) 
along with their target values or ranges.  
An adequate criticality analysis was performed as part of the pharmaceutical development. Sufficient 
information on the control of critical steps has been provided in the dossier and the in-process acceptance 
limits have been justified. A design space has been developed  for the compression stage of the process The 
available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed design space. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. A process validation 
scheme has been included in 3.2.R. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual inspection), identification (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. 
Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Karl Fischer), microbial limits (TAYMC, TYMC, E.coli) (Ph. Eur.). 
The specified organic impurities in the granules are degradation products of elexacaftor. The acceptance 
criterion for one of the specified impurities is supported by a toxicology study. The acceptance criterion for 
additional specified and unspecified degradation products are in line with ICH Q3B.  
The specified impurities and other degradation products have not been observed above the ICH reporting 
threshold of 0.1% w/w throughout finished product development, release testing and stability.  
Acceptable justifications for omitting tests for the physical form, chiral purity, residual solvents, elemental 
impurities, and nitrosamines in the finished product specification have been provided.  
The elemental impurities risk assessment concluded that content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities 
is consistently below 30% of the ICH Q3D (R2) Option 1 limits for all three active substances, confirmed by 
testing. Furthermore, it concluded that content of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities is below 30% of 
the ICH Q3D (R2) Option 1 limits for all granule excipients with the exception of colloidal silicon dioxide. For 
colloidal silicon dioxide, the Option 2b summation approach was employed to demonstrate that the maximum 
daily intake of each Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurity is well below 30% of its respective permitted 
daily exposure. Confirmatory testing results on seven representative clinical batches and three representative 
development batches of Kaftrio granules in sachet were in alignment with the risk assessment. The risk 
assessment also demonstrated that control limits for elemental impurities intentionally added in the 
elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor active substances manufacturing processes are sufficient to ensure that 
the finished product will conform to ICH Q3D (R2) requirements. Therefore, no additional controls on 
elemental impurities in the granules finished product are required. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are 
deemed necessary. 
The proposed finished product specification is acceptable.  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results from three pilot scale batches of each of the proposed strengths (60 mg/40 mg/80 mg 
and 75 mg/50 mg/100 mg) and a 30mg/20mg/40 mg strength (not proposed for marketing authorisation)  
were presented. Additional batch analysis data from two commercial scale batches of the 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 18/80 
 
 
  
75 mg/50 mg/100 mg strength, and one commercial scale batch from the 60 mg/40 mg/80 mg and 
30mg/20mg/40 mg strengths were also provided. The data confirm the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of Kaftrio granules is 24 months. 
This is supported by the following: 
• Twelve months data from three pilot scale primary stability batches of Kaftrio 75 mg/50 mg/100 mg 
granules stored at long term (25°C/60% RH) and intermediate (30°C/75% RH) conditions and six months at 
accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions  
• Twelve months data from one pilot scale primary stability batch of Kaftrio 60 mg/40 mg/80 mg granules 
stored at long term (25°C/60% RH) and intermediate (30°C/75% RH) conditions and six months at 
accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions 
• Twelve months data from three pilot scale primary stability batches of Kaftrio 30mg/20mg/40 mg (not 
proposed for marketing authorisation) stored at long term (25°C/60% RH) and intermediate(30°C/75% RH) 
conditions and six months at accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions 
• One (1) month of accelerated stability data from three supportive stability batches (one batch from each 
strength) 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, chiral purity, dissolution, XRPD physical 
form, KF water content, water activity, and microbiological quality.  
Stability studies are carried out under ICH conditions and the tested parameters are considered stability 
indicating. The batches were stored in the commercial sachet. The bracketing design is acceptable. No 
significant changes or trends have been identified at any storage condition.  
The post-approval stability protocol and the stability commitment are considered acceptable1. 
Photostability per ICH Q1B, Option 2, was not performed with Kaftrio granules as the commercial container 
closure is light protective. Nonetheless, forced degradation studies were performed, which confirmed that the 
product is not sensitive to light.  
As indicated above the entire contents of one sachet should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-
appropriate soft food or liquid and the mixture completely consumed. Once mixed, the mixture is stable for 
one hour. These instructions are the same as for the Kalydeco granules and therefore acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years stored as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) 
is acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The development Kaftrio granules is largely based on the development of the authorised Kaftrio tablets and 
the Kalydeco granules (from the same MAH). Information on development, manufacture and control of the 
granules has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the 
development of the finished product and their manufacturing process. Design space have been proposed for 
several steps in the manufacture of the active substance and finished product. The design spaces have been 
adequately verified. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory 
and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
N/A 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical studies supporting the new indication in the paediatric population 
but referred to previously submitted data. The previously conducted juvenile data were submitted again in 
this procedure upon request from CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Summary of previous data submitted related to juvenile and PK studies 
Two non-GLP dose range finding (DRF) studies and a PK study focussing on brain distribution with tezacaftor, 
and a pivotal GLP juvenile toxicity study with tezacaftor and ivacaftor were submitted in a previous variation 
procedure and in the renewal procedure for Symkevi.  
In summary, the pivotal study in rats dosed from post-natal day (PND) 21-49 did not show toxicity at the 
highest dose, approximately two times the intended human exposure. However, in one of the DRFs it was 
observed that the dose directly above the NOAEL with a 4-fold exposure margin to human resulted in 
lethality of the pups. A PK distribution study showed that lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity 
in younger rats was associated with higher brain concentrations of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. Although not 
relevant for the human population of 6 years and older, relevance of this finding cannot be excluded for the 
younger population 2 years and older.  
2.5.3.  Environmental Risk Assessment 
The environmental risk assessments for ivacaftor and tezacaftor are finalised. For elexacaftor, a phase II tier 
B assessment is currently pending and studies are ongoing.  
The prevalence data are used in the Phase I studies to determine the exposure for each active substance 
included the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in all patients, irrespective of age. Consequently, there will be no 
increase in environmental exposure to ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor from the extension of the 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 20/80 
 
 
  
indication to the 2 to 5 age group. No additional ERA studies, beyond the planned Phase II Tier B risk 
assessment for VX-445 (elexacaftor), need to be conducted to support this submission. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the current procedure, the juvenile studies are considered very relevant since dosing in the juvenile rat 
studies occured from the post-natal day (PND) 21 or earlier, which corresponds to a human age of about 2 
years 
A discussion on the safety of Kaftrio in a juvenile population from 2 years of age was required by CHMP 
including  the findings from pivotal and DRF studies, where lethality was seen in animals dosed from PND21 
with only a 4-fold exposure margin, P-pg expression maturation differences between humans and rats, 
substrate affinity differences between P-gp for both species, and brain exposure to tezacaftor and M1-TEZ.  
The MAH provided findings from the DRF and TK profiling studies and concluded that neurotoxicity of 
tezacaftor in juvenile animals is related to P-gP expression levels in rats. Consequently, the timing and dosing 
were adjusted towards the P-gP expression maturation in rats. It can be agreed that it is very likely that 
juvenile toxicity of tezacaftor is related to the functionality of P-gP in rats and that this might also be the case 
in humans. It should be noted that the maturation of expression and functionality of animal transporters 
cannot be translated to humans. The MAH, based on a study from Lam et al. (2015) on the expression levels 
of P-gP in humans, concludes that expression levels are mature within 3-6 months after birth. Consequently, 
the MAH argues that the effects observed in rats are not relevant for children aged 2-6 years old. However, 
Nicolas and de Lange* (2019) was critical on the methods and design of the study conducted by Lam et al. 
Furthermore, they refer to some clinical (functional) data on experience with P-gP substrates suggesting that 
expression is not necessarily equally translated to the functionality of P-gP. Also, data on the functionality of 
P-gP in rhesus monkeys suggest maturation around 9 months, which would correlate to 1-2 years old infants. 
Therefore, the argument of the MAH that P-gP is at mature levels in infants 3-6 months old was not endorsed 
by CHMP.  
Therefore, the MAH proposed statement in section 5.3 of the SmPC  for tezacaftor(These findings are not 
relevant for the indicated paediatric population 2 years of age and older, for whom levels of P-glycoprotein 
activity are equivalent to levels observed in adults.) was considered not adequate by CHMP as not sufficiently 
based on data. A more cautious statement was requested and agreed as follows:  
These findings are likely not relevant for the indicated paediatric population 2 years of age and older, for 
whom levels of P-glycoprotein expression levels are equivalent to levels observed in adults.  
Finally, elexacaftor /tezacaftor/ivacaftor are not PBT substances. Considering the above data, elexacaftor 
/tezacaftor/ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.5.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The section 5.3 of the SmPC has been updated with the CHMP above recommended statement which is now 
acceptable. 
There is uncertainty regarding the relevance of the effects observed in juvenile rats, particularly convulsions 
and lethality seen at doses of 4-fold human exposure. Furthermore, the CHMP considered that the data 
supporting for the safe use of tezacaftor and Kaftrio in young children would primarily be based on clinical 
data.

2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
A pivotal study, Study 111, a Phase 3, open-label, 2 part (Parts A and B), multicentre study was conducted in 
subjects 2 through 5 years of age. Part A evaluated the PK, safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
administered for 15 days to confirm a dose for Part B. Part B evaluated the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and 
efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA administered for 24 weeks.  
Additionally, a BA study, Study 012, was conducted in healthy adult subjects to support the use of granules 
in Study 111 in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. The ELX 100-mg/TEZ 50-mg/IVA 75-mg FDC tablet 
used in Study 012 is the same formulation approved for use in patients ≥12 years of age and patients ≥6 
years of age who weigh ≥30 kg.  
Additionally, a sensory study, Study 013, was conducted in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the sensory 
attributes of the oral granules. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study 111 Part A evaluated the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age as a primary 
objective. PK was a secondary objective in Study 111 Part B to assess whether target exposures previously 
shown to be safe and efficacious in older children and adults were achieved with the dosing regimens 
evaluated. To minimize the amount of blood collected in the paediatric subjects, sparse PK sampling was 
used during Study 111, and a popPK modelling approach was used to describe the exposures of the three 
drugs in children aged 2-5 years. Previously developed popPK models that described the PK of ELX, M23-ELX, 
TEZ, M1-TEZ and IVA in CF adults, adolescents, 6-11y subjects were updated with the final data from Study 
111 and used to describe the exposures in children 2-5 years of age.  
Body weight was the only covariate found to have a clinically meaningful impact on ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-
TEZ and IVA disposition in subject 2 through 5 years of age. Overall, the final models demonstrated 
suitability for the simulations. 
The simulations results demonstrated that under the studied dosing regimen with a 14 kg weight cutoff, the 
exposures were within the 5th to 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of 
age for both weight groups, although the median of the ELX exposures was below of the median seen in 
adults, (see Figure 2 below). M23-ELX exposures in some subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weighed 
≥14 kg were outside the 5th to 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age 
from Studies 102 and 103. These exposures are below the maximum steady-state AUC of 332 μg∙h/mL 
observed from Study 104 (ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h), and thus are within the adult 
exposure range previously shown to be safe and efficacious.  
The majority of TEZ exposures were within the 5th and 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for 
subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group. The individual M1-TEZ exposures for subjects 2 through 5 
years of age were higher than the M1-TEZ exposures in subjects ≥18 years of age but lower on a mean level 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 22/80 
 
 
  
than the M1-TEZ exposures in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing ≥30 kg who received the adult 
dose (see Table 3). The range of M1-TEZ exposures for subjects 2 through 5 years of age is also generally 
below the maximum steady-state AUC observed from previous clinical studies of ELX/TEZ/IVA (Studies 102, 
103, 104, and 106).  
Overall, it can be concluded that in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures were within the exposure range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.

Table 3: Summary of Steady-State Exposures in different age groups 
Bioequivalence 
Study 012 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover study to evaluate relative 
BA of an ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg FDC granule formulation compared to a reference ELX 100 
mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg FDC tablet formulation.  
Exposures of ELX were approximately 18% to 19% lower after administration of the FDC granules relative to 
the reference FDC tablet in study 012. However, the 90% CIs fell within the pre-specified bounds of 0.7 and 
1.43, and the difference was deemed not clinically relevant. 
As compared with the already marketed tablet formulation, exposures of IVA were unchanged when 
administered as the FDC granules. TEZ AUC was unchanged, while TEZ Cmax was approximately 13% lower 
following administration of the FDC granules relative to the reference FDC tablet, but the respective 90% CI 
fell within the pre-specified bounds of 0.7 and 1.43; therefore, the difference was deemed not clinically 
relevant. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose proportionality of ELX/TEZ/IVA exposure between ELX 100-mg/TEZ 50-mg/ IVA 75-mg and ELX 80-
mg/TEZ 40-mg/IVA 60-mg FDC granules is expected based on the same formulation compositions and PK 
linearity of all 3 active substances. Indeed, linear pharmacokinetics of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been demonstrated 
within applied dose range. 
Concomitant use with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
Exposures of ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in CF patients aged 2 through 5 years of age receiving 
moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose modifications are similar to exposures in 
children aged 2 through 5 years of age or adults not receiving any CYP3A inhibitors, except from the 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 24/80 
 
 
  
 
 
exposure of M1-TEZ in children receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose adjustment in both 
weight groups. These exposures, which are approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th percentile of the 
exposure range for adults, still fall within the range of prior clinical experience. Newly submitted data, shows 
that the exposure between children aged 2-5 years old, and adults seems to be similar. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
There are no new pharmacodynamic studies submitted. 
Mechanism of action 
Kaftrio is a triple combination product which contains the CFTR modulators elexacaftor (VX-445), ivacaftor 
and tezacaftor. 
Tezacaftor and elexacaftor are correctors that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR to 
increase the amount of functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride 
transport. Ivacaftor, as a CFTR potentiator that enhances the channel gating activity of the CFTR that is 
delivered to the cell surface. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated primary or secondary pharmacology studies in children 2 through 5 years of age are submitted 
which is acceptable by CHMP. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As compared with the already marketed tablet formulation, exposures of IVA were unchanged when 
administered as the FDC granules. TEZ AUC was unchanged, while TEZ Cmax was approximately 13% lower 
following administration of the FDC granules relative to the reference FDC tablet, but the respective 90% CI 
fell within the pre-specified bounds of 0.7 and 1.43; therefore, the difference was deemed not clinically 
relevant. The applicant assumed a coefficient of variation of 35%, based on which 90% CI were widened to 
0.7 and 1.4. This is not entirely in line with the bioequivalence guideline.  
However, the MAH has clarified that the granules formulation is not intended for the older age group, ie. >6 
years old; therefore, the interchangeability issue is considered not relevant. In this respect, the CHMP agreed 
that there is no need to pursue further the question of meeting bioequivalence criteria or widening the 
acceptance range. However, the CHMP considered that exploring further the possibility of making the 
granules available to other age groups could be beneficial in future. Information that the formulations are not 
interchangeable has been introduced in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
A popPK modelling approach was used to describe the exposures of the three drugs in children aged 2-5 
years due to sparse blood sampling performed in study 111.  
The simulations results demonstrated that under the studied dosing regimen with a 14 kg weight cutoff, the 
exposures were within the 5th to 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of 
age for both weight groups.  
M23-ELX exposures in some subjects 2 through 5 years of age who weighed ≥14 kg, were outside the 5th to 
95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age from Studies 102 and 103; 
however, these exposures are within the adult exposure range previously shown to be safe and efficacious. 
The majority of TEZ exposures were within the 5th and 95th percentile of the observed exposure range for 
subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group. The range of M1-TEZ exposures for subjects 2 through 5 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 25/80 
 
 
  
years of age is also generally below the maximum steady-state AUC observed from previous clinical studies of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA (Studies 102, 103, 104, and 106).  
Overall, it can be concluded that in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
exposures were within the exposure range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.  
After administration of the FDC granules, exposures of ELX and TEZ were slightly lower relative to the 
reference FDC tablet, and exposures of IVA were unchanged in terms of AUC0-∞ and Cmax.  The 
corresponding table in the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
Co-administration with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
The MAH was asked to report the simulated exposures to ELX, TEZ, and IVA with the proposed dose 
reduction for concomitant use with strong and moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitors in children aged 2-5 years. The 
provided simulations show that exposures of ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in CF patients aged 2 
through 5 years of age receiving moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose modifications is 
similar to exposures in children aged 2 through 5 years of age or adults not receiving any CYP3A inhibitors, 
except from the exposure of M1-TEZ in children receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose 
adjustment in both weight groups. These exposures, which are approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th 
percentile of the exposure range for adults, still fall within the range of prior clinical experience. Newly 
submitted data, as requested by CHMP, showed that the exposure between children aged 2-5 years old, and 
adults seems to be similar. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
CF-related liver disease has been observed in patients with CF as young as 2 years of age. Although 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment is relatively rare in patients 2 through 5 years of age with CF, liver 
disease of this severity was seen in a prospective study. The proposed dose regimen for CF patients 2 
through 5 years of age with hepatic impairment is based on the same approach used for older subjects.  
Variability of the steady-state AUC for ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of 
age is similar to or lower than the variability observed in subjects 6 years of age and older. In addition, based 
on the provided simulations, the exposure to ELX, M23-ELX, TEZ is similar between subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment, with the proposed dose reduction, and between subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Exposure to M1-TEZ and IVA is slightly lower with the proposed dose regimen in subjects with moderate 
hepatic function as compared to subjects without hepatic impairment, however, it is still within the 5th to 
95th percentile of the observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age for both weight groups. 
Treatment of patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) is 
not recommended. For patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of 
Kaftrio should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose. 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the 
exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, patients 
with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio. 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023

Dosing recommendations  
For patients 2 through 5 years of age, ELX/TEZ/IVA is proposed to be administered with fat-containing food 
as follows (consistent with the dosing regimen evaluated in Study 111 Part B): 
• 
Patients weighing ≥14 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h (i.e. there is an evening dose of 75 
mg of Kalydeco granules) 
• 
Patients weighing <14 kg: ELX 80 mg qd/TEZ 40 mg qd/IVA 60 mg qAM and 59.5 mg qPM (i.e. there is an 
evening dose of 59.5 mg of Kalydeco granules)  
The proposed dosing recommendations were not in line with the dosing recommendations used in the clinical 
study, as in the clinical study, patients were included with weight ≥ 10 kg, therefore the safety in children 
with a weight < 10 kg is unknown.  
The lowest weight CF patients 2 through 5 years of age were expected to be approximately 9 kg34 by the 
MAH. Exposures in patients of this weight are expected to be similar to CF patients weighing 10 to 14 kg 
(who were considered in the popPK modeling). Therefore, no minimum weight is specified in the proposed 
dose regimen. 
Using an approach similar to that used to select the dosing regimen for subjects 6 through 11 years of age, 
popPK analyses describing the data from Study 111 demonstrated that this proposed dose regimen resulted 
in exposures of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in subjects 2 through 5 years of age that are within the range of 
exposures that achieved efficacy in subjects ≥18 years of age. The simulation results also demonstrated that 
the exposures of metabolites M23-ELX and M1-TEZ with the proposed dosing regimens are generally within 
the range of exposures in previous clinical studies of ELX/TEZ/IVA and TEZ/IVA . Additional simulations 
showed that this proposed dosing regimen is optimal for patients 2 through 5 years of age. Exposure to M1-
TEZ in children aged 2-5 years receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose adjustment in both 
weight groups is approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th percentile of the exposure range for adults. Newly 
submitted data, as requested by CHMP, showed that the exposure between children aged 2-5 years old, and 
adults seems to be similar. 
Although US CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry data indicates that only a small minority of children 2 
through 5 years of age will have a weight < 10 kg, it is uncertain whether it also applies to the European 
population. Based on the 2021 Annual Report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry 
(ECFSPR) it can be assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less 
than 10 kg. Simulations were needed to anticipate whether adjusted dosing recommendations may be 
needed for children weighing 7 kg. simulations were requested to anticipate whether adjusted dosing 
recommendations may be needed for children with lower body weight. An increase for all analytes is 
observed, expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater) for 
subjects weighing 7 kg than the simulated exposures for children weighing 10 kg. Therefore, a lower weight 
limit of 10 kg is proposed in the dosing recommendations for patients aged 2 to less than 6 years. This was 
adequately implemented by the MAH in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures were within the exposure 
range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.  
After administration of the FDC granules, exposures of ELX and TEZ were slightly lower relative to the 
reference FDC tablet, and exposures of IVA were unchanged in terms of AUC0-∞ and Cmax.  
The granules are only to be indicated for children up to 5 years of age. Unfortunately, the applicant is not 
willing to further explore the possibility of making the granules available to other age groups. 
Exposure to M1-TEZ in children aged 2-5 years receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors with the proposed dose 
adjustment in both weight groups is approximately 2-fold lower than the 5th percentile of the exposure range 
for adults. Newly submitted data, as requested by CHMP, showed that the exposure between children aged 2-
5 years old, and adults seems to be similar. 
An increase for all analytes is observed, expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being 
approximately 35% greater) for subjects weighing 7 kg than the simulated exposures for children weighing 
10 kg. Therefore, a lower weight limit of 10 kg is proposed in the dosing recommendations for patients aged 
2 to less than 6 years. This was adequately implemented by the MAH in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

Study 111 Part B Design 
Part B evaluated weight-based ELX/TEZ/IVA dosing for 24 weeks as shown in Figure 3.  
Approximately 70 subjects, of which at least 30 subjects had F/MF genotypes and at least 15 subjects had 
the F/F genotype were planned for enrolment. At least 25 subjects were between 2 and 3 years of age 
(inclusive). 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue study drug could 
enrol in an optional open-label extension (OLE) safety study. 
Figure 3: Study 111 Part B Study Design 
Study Participants 
A total of 75 subjects enrolled and were administered ELX/TEZ/IVA for up to 24 weeks, which was chosen to 
provide an adequate assessment of safety. Approximately 70 subjects, of which at least 30 subjects had F/MF 
genotypes and at least 15 subjects had the F/F genotype, were planned for enrolment. At least 25 subjects 
were between 2 and 3 years of age (inclusive). 
Subjects were enrolled at 22 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia. 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue study drug could 
enrol in an optional open-label extension (OLE) safety study (enrolment was based on the eligibility criteria 
specified within the OLE safety study protocol). 
Inclusion criteria 
1. Subject’s legally appointed and authorized representative signed and dated an informed consent form 
(ICF).

•  Genotype was confirmed at the Screening Visit. This assessment did not need to be repeated for 
confirmed subjects in Part A who wished to participate in Part B. 
• 
If the screening CFTR genotype result was not received before the first dose of study drug, a previous 
CFTR genotype laboratory report could be used to establish eligibility.  
•  Subjects who were enrolled and whose screening genotype did not confirm study eligibility were 
discontinued from the study. 
6. Subjects with stable CF disease at the start of the Treatment Period as deemed by the investigator. 
7. Subjects who were willing to remain on a stable CF medication regimen (other than CFTR modulators) 
through Day 15 (Part A) or through Week 24 (Part B) or, if applicable, through the Safety Follow-up Visit. 
8. As judged by the investigator, the parent or legal guardian was able to understand protocol requirements, 
restrictions, and instructions and the parent or legal guardian was able to ensure that the subject would 
comply with and was likely to complete the study as planned. 
Exclusion Criteria 
1. History of any illness or any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might have 
confounded the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug(s) to the subject.

Prohibited Medications 
Table 5: Prohibited Medications 
Prior and concomitant medications 
Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other medications, and 
herbal and naturopathic remedies, will be collected from each subject’s source documentation for medications 
taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study participation. 
For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled, details of prior medication will be 
documented only in the subject’s source documents. 
•  Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the Day 1 
Visit through completion of study participation. A stable treatment regimen is defined as the current 
treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before the Day 1 
Visit. Subjects should not initiate long-term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the 
Day 1 Visit through completion of study participation. Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF 
are as follows: 
o  Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should 
remain on that regimen throughout the study.  
o  Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of the study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be 
synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle 
of the inhaled antibiotic. 
o  Subjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the same 
cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of the study drug on the Day 1 
Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first 
day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 32/80 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically or up to 60 
mg daily for up to 5 days.  
•  Subjects who are using a bronchodilator should have their Multiple-breath Washout (MBW) 
assessments performed according to the guidelines provided in the protocol, Section 11.4.2. 
Dose Modification for Toxicity 
Modifications of the study drug dose were prohibited. Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, individual 
subjects were withdrawn from the study, and dosing ceased. 
Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules 
In subjects who interrupted the study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator resumed study 
drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for the interruption.  
Liver Function Tests 
Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total bilirubin >2 
× ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 
to 72 hours and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a 
subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the 
following criteria are met: 
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criteria are met: 
• Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and 
no convincing alternative aetiology is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved. 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to 
baseline or are ≤ 2 x ULN, whichever is higher. Upon resumption of the study drug, transaminases and 
bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption 
threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation 
by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed aetiology. 
Rash 
Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a 
rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator may consider resumption of study 
drug if considered clinically appropriate.

Sample size 
Part A 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 34/80 
 
 
  
 
 
Approximately 14 subjects were planned to be enrolled in Part A. Sample size calculations were determined 
based on ELX and M23-445 estimates of clearance. Assuming that the variability in this age group was the 
same as the variability observed in adults, data from 14 subjects would allow at least 80% power to target a 
95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of clearance for ELX and M23-445. 
Part B 
A total of 75 subjects enrolled and were administered ELX/TEZ/IVA for up to 24 weeks, which was chosen to 
provide an adequate assessment of safety. 
No formal power calculation was performed. 
Assuming a dropout rate of 10% or 20%, approximately 63 or 56 subjects, respectively, were expected to 
complete Part B.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Randomization was not required because all subjects were treated identically. 
An interactive web response system was used to dispense dosage based on subject weight. 
Subjects and their legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) were not 
informed of their study-related LCI, sweat chloride (SwCl), faecal elastase-1 (FE-1), calprotectin, and 
immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) results during the Treatment Period (Part B only), regardless of whether 
the subject permanently discontinued treatment. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses Sets  
The following analysis sets were defined separately for Part A and Part B. 
The All Subjects Set included all subjects who were enrolled (defined as subjects having data in the clinical 
database for this study) or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set was used for all individual 
subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. 
The Safety Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set was used for 
all safety analyses. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who were enrolled and carry the intended CFTR allele 
mutation and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS was used to summarize subject demographics 
and baseline characteristics, and for analyses of all efficacy and PD endpoints, unless otherwise specified. 
Analyses methods  
Analysis methods for PD and efficacy endpoints are summarized in Table 7. All P values are considered 
nominal.

The MMRM was used to estimate the within-group mean absolute change in SwCl through Week 24. The 
model included absolute change from baseline in SwCl (including all measurements up to and including Week 
24) as the dependent variable and visit as the fixed effect, with baseline SwCl value and genotype group (F/F 
vs F/MF) as covariates. The model was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees 
of freedom for the F-test of fixed effects were estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. An 
unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject errors. If the model estimation did 
not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure was used instead. Conditional on the observed 
data and covariates, missing data were assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of 
missing data was performed. 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was developed and finalized before the database lock. 
Sensitivity Analysis 
Not applicable because the primary endpoints were safety and tolerability assessments. 
Subgroup Analysis 
The absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 was analysed for the subgroup according to 
genotype group (F/F, F/MF).  
The same MMRM model was conducted for each subgroup, with the genotype group removed from 
covariates.  
Results

Conduct of the study 
The global study protocol was amended twice; country-specific amendments were prepared for 1 country.  
Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol dated 19 June 2020 was amended twice (Jun 2021 and Oct 2021). Changes 
mostly pertained clarifications and updates in definitions or measurements, i.e. ophthalmologic examinations 
were removed as part of the safety endpoint. Furthermore, the study population in Part B was expanded to 
include subjects who have at least 1 F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or an ELX/TEZ/IVA-responsive CFTR 
mutation.  
Country-specific amendments were prepared for 1 country.  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was amended once to create the SAP Version 2.0, dated 02 May 2022 to 
incorporated updates in Clinical Study Protocol (CSP) Version 3.0 and added planned analysis for Part B. 
Important protocol deviation (IPD) 
An important protocol deviation (IPD) was defined as any protocol deviation that may have significantly 
affected the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may have significantly affected a 
subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. 
Part A 
One subject had an IPD in Part A related to eligibility criteria. The screening haemoglobin sample was 
haemolyzed upon receipt at the laboratory and was inadvertently not redrawn; therefore, exclusion criterion 
3 (haemoglobin <10 g/dL) could not be determined. Day 1 pre-dose laboratory results showed that 
haemoglobin was >10 g/dL. 
Part B 
No subjects had IPDs in Part B 
Baseline data 
Part B 
The mean population age was 4.1 years, and over half (54.7%) of the subjects were female. The majority of 
subjects (90.7%) were White, and 8.0% were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 23 (30.7%) subjects had an F/F 
genotype, 52 (69.3%) subjects had F/MF genotypes (with 30 distinct F/MF genotypes represented), and no 
subjects had other ELX/TEZ/IVA-responsive genotypes. At baseline, the mean SwCl was 100.7 mmol/L and 
the mean LCI2.5 was 8.41. The most common concomitant medications were those typically used for the 
management of CF.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The results of Study VX20-445-111 (Study 111) are submitted to support an extension of indication of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA to include CF patients 2 through 5 years of age. Study 111 is a phase 3, multicentre study 
conducted in 2 parts to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF 
subjects 2 through 5 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation.  
Principle of Extrapolation 
The extension of the indication to children 2 through 5 years of age is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adults and adolescents to paediatric patients and has been accepted for the extension of 
indication of Kaftrio to CF patients 6 through 11 years of age (EMEA/H/C//005269/X/0008) and Symkevi 
(TEZ/IVA) (EMEA/H/C/004682/X/0015). 
Consistent with the principles described in ICH E-16, extrapolation of efficacy from adults to a younger 
population based on comparable PK exposures and safety is acceptable, because the disease process in CF 
patients of all age groups stems from a common aetiology of dysfunctional CFTR protein that is targeted by 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. The defect of the defective chloride channels is already present at birth. Because ELX/TEZ/IVA 
targets the dysfunctional CFTR, the outcome of therapy is expected to be comparable in younger age groups 
compared to adults to be shown with a similar reduction in the pharmacodynamic parameter sweat chloride.   
Extrapolation of efficacy is also supported by previously demonstrated efficacy in controlled studies of CF 
subjects 6 through 11 years of age treated with other CFTR modulators (LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA), which was 
comparable to the effect observed in adults.  
This is also outlined in the EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines 
for paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018) that describes the requirements of the application of the (partial) 
extrapolation, i.e., confirmation of the dose by PK study in children and bridging of safety and efficacy data in 
children. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In part B, subjects were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks according to the following schedule: 
• 
subjects <14 kg and ≥10 kg: ELX/TEZ/IVA 80 mg/40 mg/60 mg qAM granules and IVA 59.5 mg qPM 
granules 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 47/80 
 
 
  
• 
subjects ≥14 kg: ELX/TEZ/IVA 100 mg qd/50 mg qd/75 mg q12h FDC granules and IVA 75 mg q12h 
granules 
Subjects who completed the Part B Treatment Period and did not permanently discontinue the study drug 
could enrol in an optional open-label extension safety study (if they met the eligibility criteria for that study). 
Similar modification, interruption and discontinuation rules and prohibited medication rules are applied as for 
the adults in the marketing application studies and are acceptable. 
The study's primary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (part A) and the safety and tolerability 
of ELX/TEZ/IVA through Week 24 (Part B). Efficacy was a secondary objective and was only measured in Part 
B.  
Endpoints 
As safety is the primary objective in Study 111 Part B, efficacy parameters were defined as secondary 
outcome measures. This approach is acceptable.   
Sweat chloride, as a pharmacodynamic parameter, is an important parameter for measuring the effect of a 
modulator. In CF, sweat chloride is increased due to a defect in the CFTR modulator. This defect is assumed 
to be similar in the adult and paediatric populations. A decrease in SwCL can be considered as an effect on 
the underlying pathology.  
Pulmonary function test, i.e. multiple breath wash-out (MBW) for calculating LCI2.5 is considered important 
to measure an effect on the lungs, one of the most important affected organs in CF. The LCI2.5 can measure 
changes in the small airways. In CF, the small airways are affected earlier than the large airways. Therefore, 
the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement of efficacy is sensitive, given the more preserved lung function in 
children than in adults. Changes in BMI z-score and height z-score inform over the nutritional status, while 
FE-1, faecal calprotectin and IRT inform over the pancreatic function. Thus all parameters inform about a 
different aspect of CF and are considered valuable.  
The indication of Kaftrio is broad, including patients with severe CF and patients with less severe CF. 
Statistics 
As study 111 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding was 
done. Considering that acceptance of an extension of the indication could be based on similar exposure, 
safety, and efficacy as in adults and adolescents, a within-group change from baseline is considered 
acceptable to provide evidence of comparable efficacy with adults and adolescents.  
Each continuous efficacy and PD endpoint was analysed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
that included visit as the fixed effect, with a baseline value of the efficacy variable and genotype group (F/F 
or F/MF) as covariates. The model included all measurements of the efficacy variable up to Week 24 
(inclusive).  
Study 111 was in line with the paediatric investigational plan (PIP) as outlined in the positive compliance 
check. 
Currently, the granules are only asked to be indicated for children up to 5 years of age, while an unmet need 
in children older than 5 years of age and adults who cannot use tablets may exist for a formulation other 
than tablets. The CHMP considers unfortunate that the MAH does not further explore the possibility of making 
the granules available to other age groups, as there might be a need for patients who have difficulties 
swallowing tablets because of a concomitant disorder.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 75 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of the study drug, and 74 (98.7%) subjects 
completed treatment and the study. One subject discontinued due to an AE.  
The mean population age was 4.1 years, and over half (54.7%) of the subjects were female. The majority of 
subjects (90.7%) were White, and 8.0% were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 23 (30.7%) subjects had an F/F 
genotype, 52 (69.3%) subjects had F/MF genotypes, with 30 distinct F/MF genotypes represented, and no 
subjects had other ELX/TEZ/IVA-responsive genotypes. This population is considered representative of the 
intended population as established in the adult population.  
Of the studied population, 86.7% of the subjects did not use a modulator before. For patients with a specific 
gating mutation, modulator therapy is currently authorised for this age group. Therefore , the studied 
populations consisted of modulator-experienced and modulator naïve subjects.  
Outcomes and estimation  
As this was an open-label, single-arm study, the outcomes of the efficacy parameters were results compared 
to baseline.  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 
24 of -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6; P<0.0001). The CHMP has accepted a reduction of -10 mol/L in 
SwCl as clinically relevant. Therefore, the reduction in SwCl can be considered clinically relevant. This 
reduction is comparable with results observed in children aged 6 through 11 years of age and in the adult 
and adolescent populations.  
An improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5 is shown by a numerical decrease from 
baseline. The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 was -0.83 (95% CI: -1.01, 
-0.66; P<0.0001. The improvement (reduction) from baseline is smaller than the reduction observed in 
children 6-11 years (-1.71 (95% CI: -2.11, -1.30)). However, lung function in young children is better 
preserved than in children 6 through 11 years of age. Therefore, a slightly lower benefit is not unexpected. Of 
note, a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the LCI2.5 is not established for this population. 
Therefore, an effect larger than the natural variability might be regarded as clinically relevant. The 
improvement in the LCI2.5 over time will therefore indicate the efficacy of the drug in this young but still 
severely affected population. Results of the study have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Results of growth parameters were considered supportive of a benefit as they were stable or showed an 
improvement supporting the benefit of treatment. Also, markers of pancreatic function and inflammation 
were considered supportive as improvements in FE-1 level, Faecal calprotectin and serum IRT were observed.  
Subgroup analyses for different patient groups showed that the results in SwCl were somewhat better in the 
F/F patients, while the results of LCI2.5 were similar in the two subgroups. The results of both populations 
are generally in line with the overall group. In both groups, the observed improvements were considered 
clinically relevant demonstrating an effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Dosing regimen 
The investigated dosing regimen used in study 111 is different than the proposed recommended dose in the 
SmPC as in the SmPC no lower limit of weight is proposed. Therefore, the safety in children with a weight < 
10 kg is unknown. CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry data indicates that only a small minority of the 
children 2 through 5 years of age will have a weight < 10 kg, while it will still be close to the investigated 10 
kg. However, it needs to be justified that the lower weight cut-off applies to the European population. Based 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 49/80 
 
 
  
on the 2021 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR), it can be 
assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less than 10 kg. As 
exposure data show that the % increase for all the analytes at weight at 9.5 kg was approximately 4%, the 
expected increase in AUCtau would be 24% in a child weighing 7 kg. The applicant argued that the weight of 
7 kg is not representative of this age group based on EU registry data. Instead, the applicant refers to 2021 
ECFSPR Annual Report, in which for CF patients 2 to 5 years of age the median BMI z-score range of 
approximately -1.5 to 0.75. Further calculations were then based on BMI z-score for age and weight for age 
chart. These would prove that no children would have a weight under 10 kg. However, the use of the range 
(across the countries) of median BMI is not considered. This means that 25% of patients could have a BMI 
below -1.5 and thus a weight below the argued corresponding weight of 10 kg. Moreover, the calculations of 
the applicant are based on the assumption that weight will follow the same percentile as BMI, which can be 
questioned because in CF growth is generally affected. As these calculations are based on questionable 
assumptions, it is uncertain whether the weight of 2-year-old children with CF is adequately identified. 
Provided simulations for subjects weighing 7 kg demonstrated that the percent increase for all analytes is 
expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater) than the 
simulated exposures for children weighing 10 kg. Therefore, a lower weight limit of 10 kg is proposed by 
CHMP in the dosing recommendation of section 4.2 of the SmPC similarly to the studied subjects included in 
Part B of Study 111. This was accepted by the MAH. 
It remains unclear as to the optimal age in F-heterozygotes to start Kaftrio considering that the indication of 
Kaftrio is broad including patients with severe CF as well as patients with less severe CF. In that light a post-
approval efficacy study for children that are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment with 
Kaftrio was considered necessary. Such a study is less relevant in F/F homozygotes given that a PAES with 
another CFTR modulator Orkambi is already ongoing in the young patient population albeit that this will be 
with LUM/IVA and not ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
The MAH argued that 1) the benefits of early initiation with CFTR modulators have been demonstrated across 
multiple modulators, age groups, and genotypes through clinical studies, 2) CFTR modulators, including 
ELX/TEZ/IVA, treat the underlying mechanism of CF, and the treatment effect should be the same regardless 
of genotype. Furthermore, the MAH considered that the benefits of early initiation of CFTR modulators in 
patients with severe CF as well as patients with less severe CF are sufficiently supported by real-world data 
from the Kalydeco PAES (Study VX15-770-125) and the Orkambi PAES (Study VX18-809-128). 
However, in the CHMP view, the ongoing post-authorisation efficacy studies for Kalydeco and Orkambi in 
children 2 through 5 years will only provide further insight for children with a gating mutation (Class III) and 
children who are homozygous for F508del (Class II), respectively. These mutations are traditionally 
considered to cause severe CF. No further data will become available for subjects with residual function (F/RF 
mutations) with generally less burden of CF and a better prognosis through the ongoing PAES studies. 
Additionally, no longitudinal data will become available for subjects with F/MF mutations, although there is 
less question for these subjects with severe CF than those with less severe CF regarding the optimal age to 
start treatment. Therefore, a PAES study is considered relevant to provide further efficacy information 
especially in the less severe population such as the F/RF population. 
A future PAES in all children who are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) receiving treatment with Kaftrio will 
provide further valuable information regarding the magnitude of effect in the real world that is not already 
gathered through other studies.  The MAH committed to perform a post-approval efficacy study (PAES) for 
children that are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment with Kaftrio. The proposed 
study will investigate the long-term effectiveness comparing disease progression among children with CF who

are heterozygous for F508del-CFTR and are aged 2 through 5 years at the time of Kaftrio treatment initiation 
versus disease progression among concurrent matched cohort of children with CF who have never received 
Kaftrio treatment, in addition to a longitudinal historical cohort. The following cohorts will be defined: 
•  Kaftrio cohort: countries with commercial access to Kaftrio during enrolment period 
•  Matched cohort: countries without commercial access to Kaftrio during enrolment period 
• 
Longitudinal historical cohort: same as Kaftrio.  
A Matched Concurrent Comparator Cohorts of children who have never received Kaftrio (or other CFTR 
modulator) treatment, and who are having 2 mutations that results in minimal CFTR function that are not 
F508 mutations (MF/MF) should also be considered. Moreover, it is suggested to include a subgroup analysis 
by prior modulator treatment. The detailed protocol of the PAES will be submitted to the EMA within 6 
months of CHMP opinion which is acceptable. 
2.6.7.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children from 2 to 5 years of age was a secondary objective of Study 111 Part 
B. The observed results in Study 111 further supported the benefit of  ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 2 through 
5 years of age. 
The CHMP agreed that partial extrapolation concepts can be applied for the assessment of the clinical data in 
this young age population.  
This is based on : 
1)the similarity of the underlying pathophysiology of CF adults and paediatric patients, 
2) the fact that PK exposures in patients from 2 to 5 years of age were within or generally within the range 
observed in subjects ≥18 years of age,  
 3) the effect in the SwCl being similar to the older ages group, efficacy in patients from 2 to 5 years of age 
can be partially extrapolated from data from the Phase 3 studies in CF subjects ≥6 years of age.  
Consistent with the efficacy demonstrated in subjects ≥6 years of age, a clinically improvement in SwCl, was 
observed. Other clinical parameters were supportive of efficacy. Collectively, these efficacy data support the 
benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
Provided simulations for subjects weighing 7 kg demonstrated that the percent increase for all analytes is 
expected to be approximately 30% greater (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater) than the 
simulated exposures for children weighing 10 kg. Therefore, upon CHMP’s request, a lower weight limit of 10 
kg was added in the dosing recommendation of section 4.2 of the SmPC similarly to the studied subjects 
included in Part B of Study 111. 
However, as the efficacy data remain limited in certain mutations in particular for less severe patients with 
F/RF mutations and the unanswered question of the optimal age to start Kaftrio, the CHMP requested the 
MAH to perform a PAES study and collect efficacy data post-approval for children that are F heterozygotes 
(aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment with Kaftrio. 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures related to the PAES study :

Incidence of adverse events  
Part A 
Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF disease in CF 
subjects 2 through 5 years of age or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Part B 
AEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects are summarized by PT in Table 17. 
The most common AEs (≥10% incidence overall) by PT were cough, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, vomiting, COVID-19, 
nasal congestion, rash, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, ALT increased, and infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF. Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations or 
complications of CF disease in CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age or with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Table 17: AEs Occurring in At Least 5% of Subjects by PT (Safety Set, Part B)
Severity of Adverse Events 
Part A 
All AEs were mild (66.7%) or moderate (16.7%) in severity, and no subjects had severe or life-threatening 
AEs. There were no Grade 3/4/5 AEs.  
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 54/80 
 
 
  
 
Part B 
All AEs were mild (62.7%) or moderate (36.0%) in severity, and no subjects had severe or life-threatening 
AEs. (Table 16). Two (2.7%) subjects had SAEs. There were no Grade 3/4/5 AEs. 
Relationship of Adverse Events 
Part A 
One (5.6%) subject had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug, and 4 (22.2%) 
subjects had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as possibly related. 
Most frequent related AEs were ALT increased, and AST increased for each 2 events (11.1%). 
Part B 
No subjects had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug, and 32 (42.7%) 
subjects had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as possibly related.   
Table 18: Related AEs Occurring in At Least 2% of Subjects by PT (Safety Set, Part B)
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs were defined as AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs of rash  
Part A 
Elevated Transaminase Events 
Three (16.7%) subjects had nonserious elevated transaminase events, all of which were assessed by the 
investigator as moderate in severity, and none of which led to study drug interruption or discontinuation.  
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 55/80 
 
 
  
 
 
Rash Events 
Four (22.2%) subjects had a total of 6 nonserious rash events. All events were assessed by the investigator 
as mild in severity. None of the events was serious or led to study drug interruption or discontinuation. All 
rash events had an outcome of being resolved.  
Part B 
Elevated Transaminase Events 
Eight (10.7%) subjects had elevated transaminase events. 
All of the events were mild or moderate in severity. None of the events was serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation. Elevated transaminase events led to treatment interruption in 1 (1.3%) subject. The 
elevated transaminase events had a mean (SD) duration of 24.8 (24.8) days, and the mean (SD) time-to-
onset of the first event was 50.0 (52.0) days. 
Rash Events 
Fifteen (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity; none 
were serious. Twelve of the 15 subjects had rash events that were assessed by the investigator as not 
related or unlikely related to the study drug or were confounded by concurrent viral symptoms. Two subjects 
had rash events that led to treatment interruption, both of whom resumed the study drug without recurrence 
of the rash. There were no study drug discontinuations due to rash events. 
By sex, 4 (9.8%) female subjects and 11 (32.4%) male subjects had a rash. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in Part A or Part B.  
Serious adverse events  
Part A 
No subjects had SAEs. 
Part B 
Two (2.7%) subjects had SAEs: 
•  One subject had concurrent SAEs of anal incontinence (mild in severity), urinary incontinence 
(moderate in severity), and abnormal behaviour (moderate in severity). The subject was 3 years of 
age. On Study Day 66, the subject had behavioural changes (hyperactivity and aggression) with 
increased urinary urgency and enuresis. From Study Days 80 to 113, the study drug was interrupted 
and resumed twice, with reported improvement of symptoms within 1 to 2 days upon study drug 
interruption and return of symptoms within 1 to 2 days upon resumption. The study drug was 
discontinued on Study Day 127. The investigator did not consider the subject’s behavioural changes 
outside of what is typically seen in the subject's age group but assessed these events as possibly 
related to the study drug. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 56/80 
 
 
  
•  One subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF that was assessed by the investigator as moderate in 
severity and not related to the study drug; the event did not lead to a change in study drug dosing 
and was resolved. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Chemistry 
Part A 
There were 4 (22.2%) subjects with ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 3 (16.7%) of whom had ALT or AST >5 × ULN, 
and 1 (5.6%) of whom had ALT or AST >8 × ULN; all of these subjects had elevated ALT at screening or Day 
1. There were no subjects with ALT or AST >3 × and total bilirubin >2 × ULN. 
Part B 
Nine (12.0%) subjects had AEs related to chemistry findings (excluding LFT and CK results); all of these AEs 
were mild or moderate in severity, and none led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
Liver Function Tests 
The majority of subjects had ALT and AST values that remained ≤3 × ULN. Six (8.0%) subjects had ALT or 
AST >3 × ULN, 2 (2.7%) subjects had ALT or AST >5 × ULN, and 1 (1.3%) subject had ALT or AST >8 × 
ULN. No subjects had total bilirubin >2 × ULN.

Creatine Kinase 
The mean (SD) increase in CK ranged from 25.7 (82.4) U/L at Day 15 to 41.7 (47.3) U/L at Week 20. The 
majority of subjects had CK levels ≤2 × ULN; no subjects had CK levels >5 × ULN.  
AEs of CK elevation occurred in 1 (1.3%) subject. 
Haematology 
In Part A and Part B, there were no trends observed in haematology parameters. No subjects had AEs related 
to haematology findings in part A. Two (2.7%) subjects had AEs related to haematology findings, i.e. 
Neutrophil count decreased 1 (1.3%), and Platelet count increased 1 (1.3%) in Part B.   
Coagulation 
No trends were observed in coagulation parameters in Part A and Part B. In addition, no subjects had AEs 
related to coagulation findings. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Signs, Pulse Oximetry, Electrocardiogram, Physical examination 
No trends were observed in the vital signs parameters, pulse oximetry, ECG parameters and physical 
examination. No subjects had AEs related to finding in vital signs, pulse oximetry, ECG or physical 
examination in Part A or Part B.

provided, which can be agreed. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse Events that led to Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Part A 
No subjects had AEs that led to discontinuation of the study drug. 
Part B 
One (1.3%) subject had an SAE of abnormal behaviour that led to discontinuation of the study drug. 
The event was moderate in severity and assessed by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug. 
The study drug was withdrawn, and the events resolved in a few days. 
Adverse Events that led to Interruption of Study Drug 
Part A 
One (5.6%) subject had AEs of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia of that led to treatment interruption. 
The AEs were mild in severity and assessed by the investigator as not related to the study drug. The AEs 
resolved, the subject resumed ELX/TEZ/IVA, and completed dosing.  
Part B 
Five (6.7%) subjects interrupted their study drug due to AEs. 
• 
Two subjects interrupted the study drug due to AEs of rash. Both rash events were moderate in 
severity; one was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug, and the other as 
unlikely related to the study drug. The events resolved, and both subjects resumed the study drug 
with no recurrence of the rash.  
•  One subject interrupted study drug due to concurrent SAEs of anal incontinence and urinary 
incontinence. The SAE of anal incontinence was mild in severity and the SAE of urinary incontinence 
was moderate in severity. Both SAEs were assessed by the investigator as possibly related. The 
events resolved, and the study drug was resumed. 
•  One subject interrupted the study drug due to an AE of aggression, which was moderate in severity 
and assessed by the investigator as possibly related. The event was resolved, and the study drug was 
resumed with no recurrence of the event. 
•  One subject interrupted the study drug due to AEs of ALT, AST, and GGT increased, which were all 
mild in severity and assessed by the investigator as not related. The subject enrolled in an open-label 
extension study on study drug interruption. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
As of 20 July 2022, it is estimated that 57,577 patients (representing 70,506 person-years) have been 
exposed to ELX/TEZ/IVA worldwide through commercial access or compassionate use programs. Of these 
57,577 patients, 25,687 were from US commercial use. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 61/80 
 
 
  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data set to support the application in children aged 2 through 5 years of age is provided by the 
single-arm, open-label study VX20-445-111, where 18 (Part A) and 75 (Part B) patients were treated for 2 
weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. The mean exposure was 23.8 weeks (part B). As the provided safety data 
set is limited to support chronic use, extrapolation of the safety results obtained in children 6 through 11 
years of age and the data obtained in adults and adolescents are also supporting this application.  
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as shown by 
the reported low number of serious adverse events (0% in part A, 2.7 % in Part B), treatment interruptions 
(5.6% in Part A, 6.7% in Part B) and treatment discontinuations due to AE (0% in Part A, 1.3% in Part B). 
Overall, these findings are in line with the findings in children 6 through 11 years of age and the data 
obtained in adults and adolescents.  
Adverse events, related adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths 
In Part A, all AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and no subjects had severe or life-threatening AEs. Five 
subjects (27.8%) had a related AE. In Part B, seventy-four (98.7%) subjects had at least 1 AE. All AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity, and no subjects had severe or life-threatening AEs.  
The most common AEs (≥10% incidence overall) by PT were cough, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, vomiting, COVID-
19, nasal congestion, rash, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, ALT increased, and infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF. The AEs were mostly likely connected with manifestations or 
complications of CF, common illness in subjects 2 through 5 years of age or with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
In Part A, one (5.6%) subject had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to the study drug, 
and 4 (22.2%) subjects had AEs that the investigator assessed as possibly related.  
In Part B, no subjects had a related AEs and 32 (42.7%) subjects had AEs that were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related. The number of treatment-related adverse events (related and possibly 
related) is consistent with the pivotal study 102 (47.6%) and study 106 Part B in children 6 through 11 years 
of age (50%). In part B, the related AEs were mostly consistent with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Related AEs were dominated by cough (10.7%), ALT increased (9.3%), rash (5.3%) and AST (4.0%). Next, 
AEs in SOC Psychiatric disorder were frequently observed, i.e., the PTs aggression, irritability and 
psychomotor hyperactivity, each 4%.  
In children 6 through 11 years of age, behavioural AEs were also observed; these were aggression, anxiety 
(3%) and depressed mood (1.5%). Aggression and irritability occur more often in children of 2-5 years 
compared to 6-11 years. Because of the relatively low number of patients in the studies, the low incidence of 
the AEs and the absence of a placebo arm, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion. However, the numbers 
are higher than in the adult/adolescent population (abnormal dreams, anger and libido decreased, each 
0.5%).  
There are no analyses of de-challenge or positive rechallenge of the identified cases. Currently, there are 
three post-authorisation studies in the pharmacovigilance plan for the safety concern “use in children aged 2 
to 11 years”, the ongoing PASS (final report 2025), study 107 with the interim analysis report in February 
2023 and the open-label extension study (study 112), which will be finalised in June 2025. In addition to 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 62/80 
 
 
  
these already planned activities, the MAH has confirmed to monitor and analyse psychiatric-related AEs in the 
PSURs for all -patients groups in the 3 age categories.  
Only in Part B, 2 (2.7%) SAEs were observed, one subject of 3 years of age with concurrent SAEs of anal 
incontinence, urinary incontinence, and abnormal behaviour. The investigator did not consider the subject’s 
behavioural changes outside of what is typically seen in the subject's age group but assessed these events as 
possibly related to the study drug. Another subject had an SAE of infective PEx of CF that was assessed by 
the investigator as moderate in severity and not related to study drug. Overall, the number of SAEs is low, 
consistent with the finding in children 6 through 11 years of age and lower than in adults and adolescents 
and therefore supportive for safety.  
There were no deaths in study 111. 
Adverse events of specific interest 
AESIs were defined as AEs of elevated transaminases and AEs of rash. 
In Part A, three (16.7%) subjects had nonserious elevated transaminase events, all moderate in severity, 
none of which led to studying drug interruption or discontinuation. In Part B, eight (10.7%) subjects had 
elevated transaminase events, specifically, 8 (10.7%) subjects had ALT increased, and 4 (5.3%) subjects 
AST increased. None of the events was serious or led to treatment discontinuation, while in 1 (1.3%) subject 
led to treatment interruption. To be included in part B of Study 111, subjects must have had no elevated 
serum ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN at screening and in the previous year; the latter was 
not an exclusion criterion in the other studies. This may have led to the inclusion of healthier subjects. 
Despite the more stringent exclusion criteria, the incidences of AE of ALT or AST elevations were quite 
similar, while threshold analyses indicate a trend of more events. Nevertheless, this is not considered 
worrisome because elevation of ALT and AST are more common in children compared to adults. Therefore, no 
further action is required as section 4.4 the SmPC currently recommends monitoring of transaminases (ALT 
and AST) and total bilirubin prior to initiating treatment every 3 months during the first year of treatment 
and annually thereafter for all patients. 
The number of ALT increased is similar to the number in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (7 (10.6%)) and 
to the number in adults and adolescents (20 (9.9.%)) in study 102. However, as the frequency is higher in 
children 2 through 5 years of age and in children 6 through 11 years of age, the table in section 4.8 has been  
updated to frequency very common (> 1/10) for ALT increased.  
Regarding rash, 4 (22.2%) subjects had a total of 6 nonserious rash events in Part A, while 15 (20.0%) 
subjects in Part B. This is generally similar to the subjects 6 through 11 years of age and higher than in the 
adults and adolescents. However, rash occurs frequently in young children as symptoms of a common viral 
disease of the youth.  
These ADRs are described in the paediatric part of section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Discontinuations and disruptions of medication 
Only in Part B 1 subject discontinued due to an SAE of abnormal behaviour.  
Regarding disruption of medication, in Part A 1 (5.6%) subject interrupted medication because of unrelated 
AEs of hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia. In Part B, 5 (6.7%) subjects interrupted the study drug due to 
AEs i.e., 2 subjects with rash, 1 subject with anal and urinary incontinence, 1 subject because of aggression, 
and 1 subject because of elevation of AEs of ALT, AST, and GGT. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 63/80 
 
 
  
The event of hyperamylasaemia and hyperlipasaemia considered unrelated to study drug indicates 
involvement of the pancreas, one of the earliest- and most commonly- affected organs in patients with cystic 
fibrosis. Therefore, the events can be considered a complication of CF.  
The event of anal and urinary incontinence, assessed by the investigator as possibly related, occurred in the 
same subject as the aggression. The events resolved, and the study drug was resumed without reoccurring 
events. Behavioural changes, including incontinence in young children, are difficult to interpret. No further 
conclusions can be drawn from this one case. No further action is required for these cases. Increases in liver 
enzymes and rash are known effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA and have already been adequately addressed in the 
SmPC section 4.8.   
Liver Function Tests 
The findings are generally in line with the results found in the study in children 6 through 11 years of age and 
the studies in adults and adolescents, and there were 4 (22.2%) subjects in Part A and 6 subjects (8.0%) in 
Part B with ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 3 (16.7%) subjects of whom in Part A and 2 (2.7%) in Part B had ALT or 
AST >5 × ULN, and 1 (5.6%) of whom in Part A and 1 (1.3%) in Part B had ALT or AST >8 × ULN. No 
subjects had total bilirubin >2 × ULN. One patient had AST > 20 x ULN. Overall, the findings are in line with 
the known profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
A total of 5 subjects had QRS duration >89 msec on the ECG. For three of the five subjects, the prolongation 
of the QRS duration remained stable at subsequent visits, for the other two subjects QRS was prolonged on 
only one occasion, with all prior and subsequent ECG measurements in the normal range. Therefore, it can be 
concluded that for these subjects, the observed QRS prolongation was not related to Kaftrio. 
One subject had an AE of lenticular opacity. In the other investigations, i.e., vital signs, pulse oximetry, 
physical examinations, no trends were observed, and no subjects had AEs related to any of the 
investigations. 
2.6.10.  Conclusion on clinical safety 
The safety in subjects 2 through 5 years of age is based on the safety data set provided by the single-arm, 
open-label study VX20-445-111 and the extrapolation of safety data obtained in children 6 through 11 years 
of age and the data obtained in adults and adolescents. 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as shown by 
the reported low number of serious adverse events, treatment discontinuations and interruptions. The safety 
findings in subjects are generally in line with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA and are similar to the 
findings in children 6 through 11 years of age and to adults and adolescents.  
Nevertheless, safety data remain limited for this patient population. Safety data will also be collected and 
provide further safety information post approval. The OLE extension study is included in the RMP.

2.7.4.  Conclusion on the RMP 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 is acceptable.  
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 70/80 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system   
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the new indication in the 2 to 5 year of age and associated limited safety data in this population, 
the PRAC is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for Kaftrio should follow a half-
yearly cycle.  
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: Updates made to the 
package leaflets for this procedure are minimal, and the structure and guidance for caregivers remains 
aligned to the principles agreed on in procedure EMEA/H/C/005269/0000. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kaftrio (ivacaftor / tezacaftor / elexacaftor) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as  
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It has an obligation to conduct post-authorisation efficacy studies [REG Art 9(4)(cc), Art 10a(1)(b), 
DIR Art 21a(f), Art 22a(1)(b)]; 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for is: Kaftrio granules are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for 
the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one 
F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1) 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and 
high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in 
the CFTR gene that result in the absence or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface, which is 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 71/80 
 
 
  
responsible for the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride 
transport in these organs results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF.  
The aim of the therapy is to improve CFTR through the cell an at the cell surface resulting in an improvement 
in the target organs.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
CFTR modulators such as ELX/TEZ/IVA are currently important therapies for cystic fibrosis as they modify the 
progress of the disease by maintaining or improving the lung function, reducing the risk of exacerbations and 
improving quality of life. A second type of therapy is symptomatic therapy, which targets specific disease 
symptoms, such as nutritional supplements, antibiotics, and mucolytics. 
Within the modulators, correctors (such as tezacaftor and elexacaftor) and potentiators (such as ivacaftor) 
are distinguished. While the correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of mutant CFTR to 
increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, potentiators enhance the CFTR's channel gating 
activity, which is delivered to the cell surface. Modulator therapy improves chloride transport at the cell 
surface. 
Kaftrio tablets in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets is currently indicated for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Kalydeco (ivacaftor), Orkambi 
(lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) are CFTR modulators approved for CF patients with 
specific mutations. Currently Kalydeco and Orkambi are authorised in  very CF patients 2 through 5 years of 
age, (Kalydeco for specific gating mutation or R117H mutation and Orkambi in subjects with F/F mutation).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is study 111, a phase 3, open-label, 2-part (Parts A and B), 
multicenter study in subjects 2 through 5 years of age. Study 111 is conducted in 2 parts (Parts A and B) in 
CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age who are heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation 
(F/MF genotypes) or homozygous for F508del (F/F genotype). A total of 18 (Part A) and 75 (Part B) subjects 
were treated for 2 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. 
The results of the bioequivalence Study 012 in healthy adult subjects to support the use of granules in Study 
111, simulations and the updated popPK models, which included PK data from adults and adolescents, were 
used to select a dosing regimen for study 111 Part B. 
The following total daily dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA for patients 2 through 5 years of age was evaluated, i.e.  
• 
• 
Patients weighing ≥14 kg: ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h 
Patients weighing ≥10 kg to <14 kg: ELX 80 mg qd/TEZ 40 mg qd/IVA 60 mg qAM, 59.5 mg qPM 
The primary objective was safety; efficacy was the secondary objective.  
The secondary endpoints included Lung Clearance Index (LCI2.5), sweat chloride (SwCl). Other endpoints 
included growth parameters, including z-scores.  
The extension of the indication to children 2 through 5 years old is based on the principle of partial 
extrapolation from adults and adolescents to paediatric patients. Consistent with the principles described in 
ICH E11 and EMA Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for 
paediatrics (EMA/189724/2018), extrapolation of efficacy from older to younger paediatric patients may be 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 72/80 
 
 
  
possible when 1) a medicinal product is to be used in younger paediatric patients for the same indication as 
those studied in older paediatric patients, 2) the disease process is similar, and 3) the outcome of therapy is 
likely to be comparable. In CF, the disease process in all age groups stems from a common aetiology of 
dysfunctional CFTR protein that is targeted by ELX/TEZ/IVA and because ELX/TEZ/IVA targets the 
dysfunctional CFTR, and the outcome of therapy in younger age group is expected to be comparable to 
adults.  
A popPK modelling approach was used to describe the exposures of the three drugs in children aged 2-5 
years due to sparse blood sampling performed in study 111. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
PopPK simulations results demonstrated that under the studied dosing regimen with a 14 kg weight cutoff, 
the exposures of all compounds, including their metabolites, were within the 5th to 95th percentile of the 
observed exposure range for subjects ≥18 years of age for both weight groups; although the median of the 
ELX exposures was below the median seen in adults.  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in the LS mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 
24 of -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6; P<0.0001). This reduction is generally comparable to the 
observed reduction in the children aged 6 through 11 years of age (LS mean difference from baseline -60.9 
mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2) as well as in the adult and adolescent population (LS mean difference from 
baseline - 41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3) and -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1) in patients with 
F/MF mutations and with F/F mutations, respectively). Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an 
improvement in ventilation inhomogeneity measured by LCI2.5; the LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from 
baseline through Week 24 was -0.83 (95% CI: -1.01, -0.66; P<0.0001 and the yearly event rate for Pex was 
0.32. 
Subgroup analyses for different patient groups (F/F or F/MF) showed that the results in SwCl were somewhat 
better in the F/F patients.  
Growth parameters normalised for age were stable or showed an improvement; LS mean absolute changes 
from baseline at Week 24 were for weight z-score: 0.02 (95% CI: -0.04, 0.09), for height z-score: -0.06 
(95% CI: -0.11, 0.00) and BMI z-score: 0.10 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.20).  
Also, improvements were observed for the markers of pancreatic function and inflammation.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The number of patients is limited, but all but 1 patient finalized the treatment.  
Only subjects with the F/MF genotype and F/F genotype were enrolled, while the indication allows for a 
broader population. However, studies that included adults and adolescents have proved that the effects 
observed in the population with the F/MF genotype or F/F genotype are similar to other genotypes that have 
at least one F508del mutation. Therefore, the study has external validity for the proposed indication. The 
safety in children with a weight < 10 kg is unknown because the study investigated subjects with a weight ≥ 
10 kg.  
Although US CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry data indicates that only a small minority of children 2 
through 5 years of age will have a weight < 10 kg, it is uncertain whether it also applies to the European 
population. Based on the 2021 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry 
(ECFSPR) it can be assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less 
than 10 kg. Therefore, simulations for subjects weighing 7 kg were performed that demonstrated an 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 73/80 
 
 
  
approximately 30% increase of the analytes (with M1-TEZ being approximately 35% greater). Therefore, a 
lower weight limit of 10 kg is proposed for the dosing recommendations in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
As study 111 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding was 
done. Therefore, only a within-group change from baseline is available.  
The improvement (reduction) from baseline in LCI2.5 is smaller than the reduction observed in children 6 
through 11 years (-1.71 (95% CI: -2.11, -1.30)). The treatment effect is also smaller than accepted before 
as clinically relevant. The results of LCI2.5 were similar in the two subgroups.  
The approved Kaftrio indication in terms of genotype is broad. The optimal age to start Kaftrio in relation to F 
heterozygotes is still uncertain. This is particularly relevant for F-heterozygotes with less severe CF, for whom 
no data will become available through ongoing studies. Furthermore, no longitudinal data will become 
available for subjects with F/MF mutations, although there is less uncertainty for the subjects with severe CF 
than with less severe regarding the optimal age to start treatment. Consequently, the CHMP requested the 
MAH to perform a PAES in all children who are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive treatment 
with Kaftrio. It will provide further valuable information regarding the magnitude of effect in the real world 
that is not already gathered through other studies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following safety findings are observed in Part B unless otherwise indicated. 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks. The safety 
findings 2 through 5 years of age are generally similar to the findings in children 6 through 11 years of age 
and to adults and adolescents. 
The most common AEs (≥10% incidence overall) by PT were cough, pyrexia, rhinorrhea, vomiting, COVID-
19, nasal congestion, rash, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, ALT increased, and infective 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) of CF.  
SAEs: One SAE of anal and urinary incontinence and abnormal behaviour was possibly related. The other SAE 
was a not related infective PEx of CF. Overall, the number of SAEs is low, consistent with the finding in 
children 6 through 11 years of age and lower than in adults and adolescents. There were no deaths.  
Related/possibly related AEs and SAEs: The number of related/possibly related AEs and SAEs was 42.7% and 
2.7%, respectively. Overall, the related AEs were mostly consistent with the known safety profile of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. However, the related AEs aggression, irritability and psychomotor hyperactivity, each 4%, in 
SOC Psychiatric disorder were observed. This is in line with observation in the population of children 6 
through 11 years of age, in which aggression, anxiety and depressed mood, each 1 event (1.5%) were 
observed. 
AESI Elevated transaminase events: 8 (10.7%) subjects had elevated transaminase events, of which 1 
(1.3%) led to treatment interruption. Specifically, 8 (10.7%) subjects had ALT increased, and 4 (5.3%) 
subjects AST increased.  The number is similar to the number in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (7 
(10.6%)) and to the number in adults and adolescents (22 (10.9%)) in study 102.  
The number of ALT increased is similar to the number in subjects 6 through 11 years of age (7 (10.6%)) and 
to the number in adults and adolescents (20 (9.9.%)) in study 102. The frequency is higher in children 2 
through 5 years of age and in children 6 through 11 years of age, therefore, the section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
amended to reflect the frequency as very common (> 1/10) for ALT increased.  
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 74/80 
 
 
  
AESI Rash events: in Part A 4 (22.2%) subjects had a total of 6 nonserious rash events, while 15 (20.0%) 
subjects in Part B. This is generally similar to the subjects 6 through 11 years of age and higher than in the 
adults and adolescents. However, rash occurs frequently in young children as a symptoms of a common viral 
disease of the youth.  
Discontinuations and disruptions of medication: One subject discontinued due to an SAE of abnormal 
behaviour. Disruptions occurred in 1 (5.6%) subject in Part A because of unrelated AEs of hyperamylasemia 
and hyperlipasemia and in 5 (6.7%) subjects in Part B because of the following AEs: 2 subjects with rash, 1 
subject with anal and urinary incontinence, 1 subject because of aggression, and 1 subject because of 
elevation of AEs of ALT, AST, and GGT.  
Liver Function Tests: the findings of elevations of liver function test (AST, ALT, bilirubin) are generally in line 
with the results found in the study in children 6 through 11 years of age and the studies in adults and 
adolescents. No subjects had total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
To be included in part B of Study 111, subjects must have had no elevated serum ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN or 
total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN at screening and in the previous year; the latter was not an exclusion criterion in the 
studies in adults or children 6 through 11 years of age. This may have led to the inclusion of healthier 
subjects. Despite the more stringent exclusion criteria, the incidences of AE of ALT or AST elevations were 
quite similar, while threshold analyses indicate a trend of more events.  
AEs in the SOC Psychiatric disorder (aggression, irritability and psychomotor hyperactivity) appear to be 
higher in the population of children 2 through 5 years of age, 6 through 11 years of age or compared to 
adults. Because of the relatively low number of patients in the studies, low incidence of the AEs and the 
absence of a placebo arm, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion.  
Overall, there is uncertainty on long term safety in children 2 to less than 6 years of age. The open label 
extension study and PASS planned studies will address this uncertainty. In addition to the two planned PASS 
studies as aPhV activities in the RMP, monitoring and analysis of the psychiatric-related AEs in the PSURs for 
all age groups will be presented in 3 age categories.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects  
Previously developed popPK models that described the PK of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in CF adults, adolescents, 6-
11y subjects were used to establish the exposure of ELX, TEZ, and IVA in children aged 2-5 years. Overall, it 
can be concluded that in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, the majority of ELX, TEZ, and IVA exposures 
were within the exposure range observed for subjects ≥18 years of age for each weight group.

The LS mean absolute change from baseline through Week 24 in SwCl is well above the CHMP accepted 
minimal improvement of approximately 10 mmol/l to be considered as clinically relevant.  
The LS mean absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through Week 24 of -0.83 is small and doubtfully 
clinically relevant as it is just below the natural variability.  
Strength of the evidence 
In CF, sweat chloride is increased, and a decrease can be considered as an effect on the underlying 
pathology. Therefore, the observed reduction in sweat chloride is an important parameter for measuring the 
pharmacodynamic effect. Besides the decline of lung function, pulmonary exacerbations impact survival in 
cystic fibrosis and reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions in 
the rate of pulmonary exacerbations are the main goals of the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The observed 
reductions of SwCl and LCI are supported by all exploratory parameters, i.e. growth parameters and markers 
of pancreatic function and inflammation.  
Observed improvements in ppFEV1 and SwCl in children 2 to 5 years of age were consistent with previous 
results in children 6 through 11 years old and in adults and adolescent populations.  
Impact of the uncertainties 
As study 111 is an open-label single-arm trial without a comparator arm, no randomisation or blinding was 
done. Therefore, only a within-group change from baseline is available.  
Based on the 2021 annual report of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) it can be 
assumed that there are underweight children in the range from 2 to 5 years weighing less than 10 
kg.  Therefore, a lower weight limit for children weighting less than 10 kgs was implemented in the dosing 
recommendations. 
The LCI2.5 can measure changes in the small airways. In CF, the small airways are affected earlier than the 
large airways. Therefore, the use of the LCI2.5 as a measurement of efficacy is sensitive, given the more 
preserved lung function in children than in adults. The improvement (reduction) from baseline In LCI2.5  is 
smaller than the reduction observed in children 6 through 11 years and below the accepted limit as being 
clinically relevant. However, lung function in young children is better preserved than in children 6 through 11 
years of age. Therefore, a slightly lower benefit is not unexpected. Therefore, the results are doubtfully 
clinically relevant. 
The optimal age to start Kaftrio in relation to certain F heterozygotes is still uncertain. In that light, the 
collection of efficacy data post-approval for children that are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will 
receive treatment with Kaftrio needs to be further explored post approval. Consequently the CHMP requested 
the MAH to perform, a PAES in all children who are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive 
treatment with Kaftrio. It will provide further valuable information regarding the magnitude of effect in the 
real world that is not already gathered through other studies. 
Safety 
There is uncertainty regarding the relevance of the effects observed in juvenile rats, particularly convulsions 
and lethality seen at doses of 4-fold human exposure.  
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as shown by 
the reported low number of serious adverse events, treatment interruptions and treatment discontinuations 
due to AE. 
EMA/CHMP/300920/2023 
Page 77/80 
 
 
  
Impact of the uncertainties 
To be included in part B of Study 111, the exclusion criteria for the hepatic function test were stricter, which 
may have led to the inclusion of healthier subjects. Nevertheless, the incidences of AE of ALT or AST 
elevations were quite similar, but the threshold analyses indicate a trend of more events. However, this is not 
considered worrisome because elevations of ALT and AST are more common in children compared to adults.  
The relevance of the observation of the related AEs in SOC Psychiatric disorder is unclear. This frequency is in 
line with observation in children 6 through 11 years of age but higher compared to the adults and 
adolescents population. As the limited clinical data do not allow for a firm conclusion, psychiatric disorders 
will be monitored post-marketing.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In this procedure, the extension of the indication to children 2 through 5 years old is based on the principle of 
partial extrapolation from adults and adolescents to paediatric patients. The extension must be supported by 
comparable PK exposures, acceptable safety, and a similar PD/efficacy effect.  
The provided integrated assessment of paediatric exposure data, popPK modelling and simulations of clinical 
data from subjects 2 through 5 years of age, subjects 6 through 11 years of age, adolescents, and adults 
confirmed that from a clinical pharmacology perspective, the proposed dosages with a 14 kg weight cut-off 
for the applied dose are appropriate for the extrapolation of efficacy to CF subjects 2 through 5 years of age. 
In study 111 in CF patients 2 through 5 years of age, efficacy was a secondary objective. Clinically relevant 
improvements were found in the changes from baseline for the SwCl. These improvements were consistent 
with previous results in subjects 6 through 11 years of age adults and adolescent populations, confirming the 
justification of partial extrapolation. Other endpoints were supportive of the finding in SwCl.  
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated by children 2 through 5 years of age up to 24 weeks, as shown by 
the reported low number of serious adverse events, treatment interruptions and treatment discontinuations 
due to AE. No new important risks were identified. Hepatotoxicity is already identified as an important 
potential risk. 
The earlier introduction of modulator therapy in younger patients from 2 years of age might be beneficial, as 
this modulator therapy has the potential to prevent the detrimental effects of CF. Considering these 
paediatric patients are treated in specialized clinics and frequently monitored, some more severe safety 
concerns, such as hepatotoxicity, are considered acceptable and manageable in clinical practice. In addition, 
the safety will be further substantiated in the follow-up extension study.  
The optimal age to start Kaftrio in relation to certain F heterozygotes is still uncertain. In that light, the 
collection of efficacy data post-approval for children that are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will 
receive treatment with Kaftrio needs to be further explored post approval. Consequently the CHMP requested 
the MAH to perform a PAES in all children who are F heterozygotes (aged 2-5 years) who will receive 
treatment with Kaftrio. It will provide further valuable information regarding the magnitude of effect in the 
real world that is not already gathered through other studies.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Kaftrio is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kaftrio is not similar to Symkevi and Tobi Podhaler within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, Kaftrio new pharmaceutical form (granules) is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Kaftrio granules are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) 
in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Kaftrio subject to the 
following conditions:

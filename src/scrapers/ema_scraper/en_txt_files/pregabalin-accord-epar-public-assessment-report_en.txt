2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pregabalin Accord is a generic medicinal product of Lyrica, which has been authorised in the EU since 6 July 
2004.  
The active substance of Pregabalin Accord is pregabalin, an analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pregabalin decreases central neuronal excitability by binding to an auxiliary 
subunit (α2-δ protein) of a voltage-gated calcium channel on neurons in the central nervous system. 
Pregabalin reduces the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and 
substance P. 
The safety and efficacy profile of pregabalin has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which 
can be found in the EPAR for Lyrica. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing 
to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic application referring to 
the reference medicinal product Lyrica, summary of the clinical data of pregabalin is available and no new 
clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Pregabalin Accord hard capsules have the same qualitative and quantitative composition, in terms of active 
substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product Lyrica. Bioequivalence of the 50 mg 
dose with the reference 50 mg Lyrica capsule and 300mg dose with the reference 300mg Lyrica capsule was 
demonstrated clinically. For the remaining doses, CHMP has accepted a biowaiver. 
The indication proposed for Pregabalin Accord is a subset of indication authorized for the reference medicinal 
product, namely treatment of 
- adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. 
- the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. 
The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 25mg, 50mg, 75mg, 100mg, 150mg, 200mg, 
225mg, 300mg of pregabalin as active substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282380/2015 
Page 8/26 
 
  
  
Other ingredients are: pregelatinized starch, talc (E553b), gelatin (capsule shell), titanium dioxide (E171) 
(capsule shell), red iron oxide (E172) (75, 100, 200, 225 and 300 mg strengths capsule shell), sodium 
laurilsulfate (capsule shell). The printing ink composition is shellac, iron oxide black (E172), propylene glycol 
and potassium hydroxide. 
The product is available in PVC/alu blister, in PVC/alu perforated unit dose blisters and in HDPE bottles. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of Pregabalin is (S)-3-(Aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid and has the following 
structure: 
The structure has been confirmed by the following methods: element analysis, IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS 
and X-ray diffraction.   
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, not hygroscopic, sparingly soluble in water, 
and practically insoluble in acetone.  
Pregabalin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by HPLC. Pregabalin shows polymorphism. According to the literature survey conducted 
by the applicant, pregabalin can exist in different polymorphic forms: amorphous, hemihydrate form, Form I, 
II, III & IV and alpha form.  The polymorphic forms “amorphous”, “hemihydrate”, “Form I, II & III (formed 
by octanol & acetone)” are not possible to be formed under the manufacturing process conditions followed by 
the active substance manufacturer.  The absence/non carryover of α-form in the active substance was 
demonstrated. DSC & XRD values cited in literature & actual experimental results for form IV are identical to 
the form manufactured by the active substance supplier (named Form-I by the active substance 
manufacturer). Batch analysis data provided confirmed that the active substance manufacturer consistently 
produces this form.  In addition, polymorphism is controlled by a XRD identification test in the active 
substance specifications. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is sourced from one supplier using three manufacturing sites including two sites 
involved in the manufacture of intermediates. 
Pregabalin is synthesized in six main chemical reactions using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. Enantiomeric purity is controlled by the process and by chiral HPLC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282380/2015 
Page 9/26 
 
  
  
 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, 
HPLC, XRD), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), enantomeric purity 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), 
appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), particle size (laser diffraction), microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data of seven production scale active substance batches are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data were provided on five production scale batches of active substance from the proposed supplier, 
stored in the container closure system intended for the market, for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification by IR and XRD, specific optical rotation, 
water content, appearance of solution, related substances, enantiomeric purity, assay and microbial limit. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes occurred in the parameters studied.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The substance was found 
to be photostable.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the retest period proposed by the ASMF holder.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim was to formulate pregabalin capsules, which are robust, stable, bioequivalent and dose proportional 
to the reference product Lyrica. The applicant followed the reference product line: 25 mg and 50 mg capsules 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282380/2015 
Page 10/26 
 
  
  
are dose proportional with respect to each other, and the 75-225 mg strengths are dose proportional with 
respect to 300 mg capsules. 
Formulation development was initiated by characterisation of the reference product (including disintegration 
time, assay, related substances content and dissolution).  
Excipients similar to reference product Lyrica were chosen but maize starch was replaced by pre-gelatinised 
starch for easier capsule filling, and lactose monohydrate and anhydrous silica (colloidal) were not used. 
Active substance /excipients compatibility studies were performed and no incompatibility issues were 
identified. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The lubricant concentration was optimized based on the results from studies assessing impact of the quantity 
of lubricant (purified talc) on the dissolution profile. 
Studies were performed to demonstrate that the polymorphic form of active substance remains unaffected 
during manufacturing process and upon storage in the proposed packaging. 
The similarity of the developed product with the reference product was assessed by comparison of dissolution 
and impurity profiles and by bioequivalence (BE) studies. 
Two bioequivalence studies were performed with the 50 mg and 300mg strengths showing bioequivalence 
between of the proposed finished product and the reference medicinal product Lyrica . A bio-waiver was 
requested for the 25 mg strength based on the result from BE-study with 50 mg capsules, and a biowaiver 
was also requested for the 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg strengths based on the results from 
BE-study with 300 mg capsules. All the conditions for biowaiver for additional product strengths as stated in 
the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) fulfilled. Comparative 
dissolution profile of Pregabalin Accord 25 mg capsules with the 50 mg capsules and Pregabalin Accord 75 
mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg capsules with the 300 mg capsules was performed. Conditions 
and methods of the dissolution studies are in accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). Results of the BE study using the 50 mg capsules can be 
extrapolated to the 25 mg strength, and results of the BE study using the 300 mg capsules can be 
extrapolated to the 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 225 mg strengths.  
The development of the dissolution method is described and the discriminatory power has been 
demonstrated. 
The impurity profiles of both generic and reference products in all strengths are similar. 
As part of manufacturing process development, the parameters blending time and lubrication time of 
common blend were optimized, effect of particle size on blend and content uniformity was studied and no 
significant impact was observed, holding time of intermediate was validated. 
The primary packaging is PVC/alu blisters, PVC/alu perforated unit dose blisters and HDPE bottles. The 
material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282380/2015 
Page 11/26 
 
  
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: sifting/milling, blending, encapsulation and packing. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
In-process controls are: description, loss on drying, assay and blend uniformity of common blend; and for 
single strength capsules: description, average net content of capsule, average weight of 20 filled capsules, 
uniformity of weight, disintegration time , lock length. In-process control during packing is leak-test. The in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three batches 
(smaller production batch size) of each strength.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
The manufacturing process will be validated according to the presented process validation scheme on three 
consecutive production batches of each strength.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form : description, 
average net content, identification of active substance (HPLC, chemical reaction), identification of colorants 
(chemical reaction), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), dissolution test, uniformity of dosage units ( Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), microbial enumeration tests (Ph. Eur.), Escherichia coli (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
The in house analytical procedures are described and validated.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three batches (smaller production batch size) of each strength. Batch 
analysis results confirmed the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided on two smaller production scale batches of finished product of each strength 
stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60%, and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH, according to the ICH guidelines. The stability batches are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in PVC-alu blister, HDPE bottle proposed for marketing, 
and in a PPCP container intended for bulk storage and transportation. Bracketing is applied for the HDPE 
container size (30 and 500 capsules container studied). 
Samples were tested according to release specifications except for the limits for total impurities and loss on 
drying (wider limit at shelf life). Matrixing is applied to microbiological quality control. The analytical 
procedures used are the same as for release and are stability indicating.   
In addition, one batch of 25mg strength and one batch of 300mg strength were exposed to light as defined in 
the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Results showed that the 
finished product is not light sensitive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282380/2015 
Page 12/26 
 
  
  
A thermal cycling study has been carried out one batch of 25mg strength and one batch of 300mg strength 
to study the effect of transportation on stability of the finished product. Batches were subjected to three 
cycles of two days at accelerated conditions followed by refrigerated temperature   (- 10 º C to -20 ºC). 
Although a significant increase was observed for loss on drying on the lower strength, all the results for both 
strengths were within the specification limits.. 
An in-use stability study was performed on one batch of 25mg strength and one batch of 300mg strength 
packaged in HDPE bottle (100’s count). The product was maintained at 25 ± 2°C and 60 ± 5% RH 
throughout the study. In-use stability study results are found satisfactory for both strengths for the duration 
covered (50 days and 100 days). 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life is 2 years with no special storage condition. The in-use shelf-
lives after first opening are 30 days (for HDPE 30’s count) and 100 days (for HDPE 200’s count). These shelf-
lives are acceptable and included in the SmPC. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture are provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  Data has been presented to 
give assurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology was provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was

considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Pregabalin Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare Ltd is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all pregabalin containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk is expected to be similar and not 
increased. The CHMP endorsed this view.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
NA 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview presented by the applicant is largely based on published scientific literature which is 
acceptable since pregabalin is a well-known active substance.  
There are no objections to the approval of Pregabalin Accord from a non-clinical point of view. The SmPC of 
Pregabalin Accord is in line with that of the reference product Lyrica and is therefore acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing pregabalin. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting conditions. 
These studies were pivotal for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of pregabalin based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr**) is of particular 
relevance.   
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Exemption 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 
1/ Corr **), if the pharmacokinetic of the active substance is linear and that the bioequivalence is 
demonstrated for one strength, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the other strengths could be waived. An 
exemption from the requirement to perform bioequivalence studies would be justified when the following 
conditions are met: the pharmaceutical products have the same manufacturer, same qualitative composition, 
same ratio between active substance and excipients and in vitro dissolution profile comparable to the 
reference product. 
The composition of the strengths 25 and 50 mg of the test product is quantitatively proportional. Further, the 
composition of the strengths 75, 100, 150, 200, 225 and 300 mg of the test product is quantitatively 
proportional. Therefore, two single-dose bioequivalence studies have been conducted with the highest 
strength of both composition groups, i.e. with 50 and 300 mg hard gelatine capsules. 
A biowaiver has been applied for the 25 mg strength based on the results of the BE study with the 50 mg 
strength and for 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg strengths based on the results of the BE 
study with the 300 mg strength. The applicant provided a tabular listing of the composition of the respective 
strengths and their dissolution curves at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8. More than 85% of the drug was dissolved 
within 15 minutes at all pH values tested.  
Based on these results, the CHMP concluded that the general biowaiver criteria were met. Therefore, two 
bioequivalence studies with the 50 mg and the 300mg doses and a biowaiver for the additional strengths 
were considered adequate. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 2 bioequivalence studies, one with the 50 mg 
strength (Study 169-12) and one with the highest 300 mg strength (Study 170-12).

Population studied   
Study 169-12 and Study 170-12 
The maximum within-subject variability in primary PK parameters was estimated to be ~17 % for Cmax. Using 
assumptions test/reference ratio 91.00-109.00 %, significance level 5 %, power ≥ 80 % and BE limits 80.00-
125.00 %, a crossover study with minimum 28 dosed subjects was considered to be sufficient, allowing for 
potential dropouts and withdrawals.

The study subjects were healthy volunteers. Demographic data, medical history, general physical 
examination including vital signs measurements, ECG, chest X-ray, haematology, biochemistry, serology as 
well as urine analysis were collected in the screening phase. Standard inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
used.   
Study 169-12 
28 subjects were dosed and all of them completed the study. 
Study 170-12 
28 subjects were dosed in Period I of the trial. Three subjects were withdrawn from the study on medical 
grounds in Period I. In addition, one subject discontinued from the study on his own accord in Period II.  
A total of 24 subjects completed the study and these data were used for PK and statistical analyses. The 
collected samples of the four withdrawn/discontinued subjects were also analysed as per protocol.   
Analytical methods   
Study 169-12 and Study 170-12 
Plasma concentrations of pregabalin were analysed by validated LC-MS/MS technique using solid phase 
extraction method. Pregabalin-d4 was used as an internal standard and human blank plasma containing 
K2EDTA was used as an anticoagulant.  
Pre-study validation 
The calibration range for pregabalin concentrations was from 20.195 ng/ml to 2503.690 ng/ml in study 169-
12 and 50.477 ng/ml to 15059.121 ng/ml in study 170-12. The limit of detection for pregabalin was 5.293 
ng/ml in study 169-12 and 15.310 ng/ml in study 170-12.  
The method was validated for selectivity, selectivity in presence of co-administered drugs, verification of 
interfering potential by co-administered drugs, ion suppression through infusion, linearity and goodness of fit, 
sensitivity, limit of detection, precision and accuracy, haemolysis effect, robustness, recovery, dilution 
integrity, partial volume verification, matrix effect, matrix factor, re-injection reproducibility, stability (short 
term, long term, auto sampler, freeze and thaw, bench top, wet and dry extract bench top, evaporation, dry 
extract, verification of drug stability in blood, reagent stability, mobile phase stability, long term stability in 
matrix), system performance and carry-over/ contamination check.  
169-12 
Bioanalysis of samples 
The total number of plasma samples collected for determination of pregabalin concentrations was 1232 (28 
subjects, 22 samples/subject, two periods). 10 % of the samples (124 samples) were reanalysed to assess 
the reproducibility. A total of 123 incurred sample reproducibility experiments were found to be within the 
acceptance criteria.  
Assessment report

Page 17/26 
 
  
  
170-12 
Bioanalysis of samples: A complete set of samples were received from 24 subjects. Total number of 1130 
samples (602 from period I and 528 from period II) were analysed. 10 % of the samples (124 samples) were 
reanalysed to assess the reproducibility. The incurred sample reproducibility experiments were found to be 
within the acceptance criteria.  
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Study 169-12 and study 170-12 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were the primary PK parameters used for assessment of bioequivalence. 
All PK parameters were derived individually for each subject from the concentration vs. time profiles of 
plasma pregabalin using non-compartmental model of WinNonlin Professional Software Version 5.3 (Pharsight 
Corporation, USA). Actual time-points of the sample collection were used for PK and statistical analysis.  
Statistical methods   
Study 169-12 and study 170-12 
The comparison of the PK parameters was carried out using PROC GLM of SAS® Version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc., USA). Analysis of variance was carried out by employing PROC GLM for ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞ for pregabalin.  
ANOVA model included Sequence, Formulation, Subject (Sequence) and Period as fixed effects. Each analysis 
of variance included calculation of least squares means, the difference between adjusted formulation means 
and the standard error associated with this difference. An F-test was performed to determine the statistical 
significance of the effects involved in the model at a significance level of 5 % (alpha=0.05). The power of the 
study to detect 20 % difference between the test and reference formulations was calculated and reported. 
Ratio of geometric least squares means of test and reference formulation was calculated and reported for ln-
transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. Inter and Intra-subject variability was calculated for ln-transformed 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞.  
Using two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90 % confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least 
squares means between drug formulations were calculated for ln-transformed PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t 
and AUC0-∞ for Pregabalin. Bioequivalence of Test Product vs. Reference Product was concluded, if the 90 % 
confidence interval fell within the acceptance range 80.00 to 125.00 % for ln-transformed PK parameters. 
Results 
Study 169-12 
The results are summarised in Table 2 and Table 3. Based on the PK parameters of pregabalin, the test and 
reference products were considered bioequivalent with respect to the rate and extent of absorption. The 90 
% confidence intervals for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were within the predefined acceptance ranges.

Safety data 
Study 169-12 
Three adverse events (AEs) were reported by one subject after dosing of the reference product. All AEs 
resolved without sequelae. There were no deaths or serious or significant adverse event reported in the 
study. 
Study 170-12 
Three AEs were reported by three subjects, each in Period I of the study. One AE (P. vivax malaria) was 
serious (SAE) and two were significant (repeated vomiting; the subjects were withdrawn on medical 
grounds).  The decisions to withdraw these subjects were justified and in accordance with GCP.  
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study 169-12 Pregabalin Accord 50 mg is considered bioequivalent 
with Lyrica 50 mg. The results can be extrapolated to 25 mg strength, according to conditions in the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study 170-12 Pregabalin Accord 300 mg is considered bioequivalent 
with Lyrica 300mg. The results can be extrapolated to other strengths: 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 
225 mg, according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Standard study design elements and methods were utilized and pre-specified acceptance criteria were applied 
for assessment of BE. PK endpoints and BE criteria of both studies were in line with the recommendations of 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). The inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were clearly stated in the protocol as well as the criteria for subject withdrawal. The 
pre-set BE criteria between the test and reference product were met.  
The analytical methods and validations have been performed according to the relevant guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) and were found approvable. The LLOQ of pregabalin was less than 5 % of 
Cmax, which was acceptable to the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/282380/2015 
Page 20/26 
 
  
  
A single dose bioequivalence studies were considered sufficient since the application concerns an immediate 
release formulation.  Steady state studies are not indicated as no accumulation of pregabalin is expected, and 
bioavailability is not affected by repeated doses.  
The results confirm that blood sample collection schedule was appropriate as all pre-dose pregabalin 
concentrations were zero (or <LLOQ), Cmax was not observed in the first post-dose sample for any of the 
subjects and the extrapolated area was less than 20 % for each subject indicating that the duration of 
sampling was sufficient. 
The protocol deviations in study 169-12 included late check-in, late post-dose sampling due to problems in 
obtaining the sample, and one case of concomitant medication (paracetamol). The protocol deviations in 
study 170-12 included only late post-dose sampling (maximum deviation 4 minutes). Such deviations are 
anticipated to be seen in BE studies and are not expected to invalidate study results. 
A routine GCP inspection of Study 170-12 (analytical and clinical laboratories) was performed. The study was 
found to be GCP compliant.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the results of the pivotal bioequivalence studies submitted, Pregabalin Accord hard capsules are 
considered bioequivalent to Lyrica hard capsules.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pregabalin hard capsules. The reference product Lyrica is 
indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, adjunctive therapy in adults 
with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
(GAD) in adults. Pregabalin Accord indication is limited to adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures 
with or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults, 
which is acceptable. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary 
of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-sequence, 
two-period, cross-over, single dose design. The design was considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of 
dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical 
method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies, Pregabalin capsules 300 mg are considered bioequivalent 
with Lyrica hard capsules 300 mg with respect to rate and extent of absorption of Pregabalin; and Pregabalin 
capsules 50 mg are considered bioequivalent with Lyrica hard capsules 50 mg with respect to rate and extent 
of absorption of Pregabalin. 
The results of study 170-12 with 300 mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths: 75 mg, 
100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg, and the results of study 169-12 with 50 mg formulation can be 
extrapolated to the other strength 25 mg, according to conditions in the relevant Guideline. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Pregabalin Accord in the treatment of  
- adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. 
- the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

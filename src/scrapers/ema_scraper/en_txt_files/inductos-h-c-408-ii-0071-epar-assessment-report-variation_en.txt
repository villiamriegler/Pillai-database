See Annex A 
The following variation was requested: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
II 
an approved one 
The MAH applied for an extension of the indication to broaden the use of InductOs in lumbar interbody 
spine fusion. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC. Further, the MAH proposed to update the SmPC section 4.4 with warnings related to type of 
surgery, device and spinal level, and to update sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC based 
on newly available non-clinical and clinical data relating to immunogenicity, tumorigenicity or fusion 
success. The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH proposed 
to update the standard term from "kit for implant" to "powder, solvent and matrix for implantation 
matrix", and to change the expression of the strength from 12mg to 1.5 mg/ml throughout the SmPC, 
labelling and Package Leaflet. In addition, the MAH proposed to take the opportunity to implement the 
latest QRD template (version 9.0) and to make editorial changes throughout the annexes. A revised 
RMP version 2 was provided as part of the application. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet as well as 
the Risk Management Plan.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
InductOs,  containing  dibotermin  alfa  (recombinant  human  Bone  Morphogenetic  Protein-2  (rhBMP-2)), 
is  an  osteoinductive  protein  for  inducing  bone  formation  when  used  as  an  implant  with  a  suitable 
matrix.  InductOs  (EMEA/H/C/408)  is  a  single-use  medicinal  product  presented  as  a  powder,  solvent 
and matrix for implantation. It includes 12 mg of dibotermin alfa, a solvent (Water for Injection) and 
an  absorbable  collagen  sponge  (ACS),  a  matrix  made  from  bovine  Type  I  collagen.  InductOs  is 
prepared for use by reconstituting the lyophilised dibotermin alfa in Water for Injection to form a 1.5 
mg/mL solution, which is then applied to the ACS for implantation. 
Currently InductOs is indicated: 
• 
• 
for  single-level  (L4-S1)  anterior  lumbar  spine  fusion  as  a  substitute  for  autogenous  bone  graft  in 
adults  with  degenerative  disc  disease  (DDD)  who  have  at  least  6  months  of  non-operative 
treatment for this condition. 
for  the  treatment  of  acute  tibia  fractures  in  adults,  as  an  adjunct  to  standard  care  using  open 
fracture reduction and intramedullary unreamed nail fixation. 
The  initial  indication  was  treatment  of  acute  tibia  fractures  (approved  in  2002).  It  was  limited  to 
unreamed nail fixation in 2008, because of an increased infection rate  in subjects treated with reamed 
nail fixation. The second indication – anterior lumbar spine fusion – was approved in 2005.  
Assessment report

Page 5/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With this variation the MAH aims to:  
1)  demonstrate  the  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  of  InductOs  when  used  in  conjunction  with  CE-
marked  interbody  fusion  devices  made  of  titanium  (in  addition  to  LT-CAGE  Device),  or 
polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and allograft bone spacers for lumbar interbody spine fusion; 
2)  support the responsible implantation of InductOs using surgical approaches other than anterior, 
or anterior laparoscopic for lumbar interbody fusion;  
3)  support the use of InductOs for spine fusion at all lumbar levels. 
The proposed new indication is as follows: 
‘InductOs  is  indicated  for single-level (L4-S1)  anterior  lumbar  interbody  spine  fusion  as  a  substitute 
for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have at least 6 months of non-
operative treatment for this condition.’   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The aim of the present Type II variation is to (1) demonstrate the (non-)clinical efficacy and safety of 
rhBMP-2/ACS when used in conjunction  with CE-marked interbody fusion devices/spacers, other than 
the LT CAGE device and which are made of titanium, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and allograft bone 
for  lumbar  interbody  spine  fusion;  (2)  support  the  safe  use  of  InductOs  in  surgical  approaches  other 
than anterior approaches; and (3) support spine fusion at all lumbar levels. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
To support this application, the MAH analysed seven (7) animal pharmacology studies; five (5) sheep 
and two (2) nonhuman primate spine fusion model studies (Table 1). 
The  ideal  model  for  lumbar  spine  fusion  includes  a  spine  with  anatomy  and  loading  similar to  that  of 
humans  as  well  as  bone  formation  comparable  to  that  of  humans.  The  model  that  most  closely 
matches these criteria is the nonhuman primate model. 
The sheep spine model has also been used to reduce the number of primate studies and, because of 
the  biomechanical  similarities  between  the  sheep  and  human  spines,  it  is  able  to  serve  as  a  relevant 
animal model for the human spine (Wilke, 1997).

l: histological analysis at 6 month 
Study PC-9503: The data showed that there was no significant difference between ICBG and rhBMP-2 
groups  in  biomechanical  stiffness,  in  any  direction.  The  rhBMP-2/ACS-treated  animals  had  dense 
remodelled  bone  growing  through  the  holes  in  the  cage  walls  and  trabecular  bone  bridging  adjacent 
vertebral  bodies.  In  contrast,  the  cages  from  the  autograft  treated  animals  were  variably  filled  with 
new bone, remnants of autograft, fibrous tissue, and fibrocartilage. 
Study  PC-9905:  Compared  with  a  sham  control  group,  A  and  B  showed  increased  stiffness  in  all 
rotational directions and in tensile loading. Group B showed the most complete fusion with numerous 
trabeculae through the disc space connecting the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies; implant osseointegration 
was observed in 50% of animals. In Group A, most of the fusion was in the form of an anterior callus 
that bridged the vertebral bodies. 
Study PC-0009: The difference between Groups A and B was not significant. There was no significant 
difference between histological fusion rates in Group A (71%) versus Group B (100%). Compared with 
Group  A  (ICBG),  Group  B  (rhBMP-2/ACS)  showed  a  significant  increase  in  stiffness  in  the  loading 
directions of flexion and left lateral bending (P<0.01). Increases in all other loading directions were not 
statistically  significant.  For  all  6  loading  directions:  Groups  A  and  B  showed  significantly  greater

stiffness  than  the  sham  Group  (P<0.05).  Biomechanical  data  correlated  well  with  radiographic  and 
histological data for Groups A and B. 
Study PC-0510:  In  the  high  dose  fusion,  a  moderate  to  marked  endplate  and  peri-implant  resorption 
was  observed  by  3-weeks  and  continuing  to  4-weeks.  In  comparison,  the  normal  dose  levels 
demonstrated  minimal  endplate  and  vertebral  body  resorption.  By  20  weeks,  bone  resorption  effects 
were not observed in either group and bone formation occurred demonstrating the transient nature of 
this response. 
Study  PC-0103:  This  study  was  presented  to  provide  additional  evidence  on  the  biocompatibility  of 
rhBMP-2/ACS with interbody fusion devices made from PEEK. The variation did not intend to seek an 
additional  indication  for  cervical  spine  fusion.  There  were  2  treatments  per  animal,  per  group. 
Compared  with  the  sham  Group  (cadaver  sheep  spines),  animals  treated  with  rhBMP-2/ACS  or  ICBG 
for 12 months showed significant increases in stiffness in all 6 loading directions. 
Study PC-9602: The 3 animals in the rhBMP-2/ACS high-dose Group (1.5 mg/mL) showed continuous 
bone  growth  through  the  device  to  the  adjacent  vertebra  at  12  weeks.  The  low-dose  Group  (0.75 
mg/mL)  showed  slightly  less  bone  density  of  the  formed  bone  at  12  weeks.  By  24  weeks,  both 
rhBMP-2/ACS Groups showed similar continuous bone growth through the device. The CT scans of the 
control animals (0 mg/mL rhBMP-2/ACS) only showed some bone growth at the vertebral bodies that 
was not continuous across the disc space. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
The  main  risks  identified  with  the  use  of  rhBMP-2/ACS  in  spine  fusion  were  associated  with  the 
pharmacological  properties  of  BMPs  and  the  role  they  play  in  the  process  of  bone  regeneration  and 
healing  which  includes  an  initial  acute  inflammatory  response,  a  resorptive  phase,  subperiosteal  and 
endosteal  proliferation,  bone  formation,  consolidation  and  finally  remodelling  by  osteoclast  and 
osteoblast activity. Collectively there are 3 main concerns: 
• 
Formation of fluid collections (possibly leading to pseudocysts , localised oedema & implant site 
effusion), 
•  Bone  resorption  (possibly  leading  to  osteolysis,  device  dislocation  &  subsidence  of  the  disc 
space), and 
•  Heterotopic ossification (possibly leading to nerve compression).

Study  PC-0615:  This  study  was  performed  following  limited  reports  of  encapsulated  fluid  collections 
(pseudocysts)  observed  following  off-label  use  of  InductOs  in  transforaminal  lumbar  interbody  fusion 
(TLIF)  or  posterior  lumber  interbody  fusion  (PLIF)  procedures.  The  normal  fill  group  (A)  and  other 
groups where rhBMP-2/ACS was placed outside of the interbody device (C and D) did not consistently 
demonstrate  resorption  or  fluid  pockets.  This  suggested  that  transient  bone  resorption  and  possibly 
fluid formation may  not only be influenced by the total rhBMP-2 dose supplied, but by the total dose 
supplied per volume of space to be grafted. 
Study PC-0523: The results from this rat ectopic model and cancellous bone environment showed that 
higher  concentrations  of  rhBMP-2  lead  to  exaggerated  pharmacological  effects  of  rhBMP-2  leading  to 
fluid collection and an imbalance between osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity in bone remodelling. 
Study  PC-0443:  The  results  showed  that  as  the  local  concentration  of  rhBMP-2  increases,  either  by 
increasing  the  solution  concentration  or  by  overfilling  the  defect  with  rhBMP-2/ACS  the  peri-implant

effects  of  osteoclastic  activity  increases.  This  increased  osteoclastic  activity  caused  peri-implant 
transient resorption in the overfilled and or hyper-concentrated groups. 
Study  PC-9502:  The  results  showed  that  there  was  an  increased  incidence  of  narrowing  of  the 
neuroforamina  and  stenosis  in  the  rhBMP-2/ACS-treated  groups,  however,  without  clinical  or 
neurological consequences. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH sought to remove the limitation of using a single, titanium interbody fusion device (LT-CAGE 
device),  and  permit  the  use  of  rhBMP-2/ACS  with  other  interbody  fusion  devices/spacers  made  from 
plastic/polymer materials such as PEEK or allograft bone. Compatibility with rhBMP-2/ACS in terms of 
the  binding  and  release  of  rhBMP-2  with  these  materials  was  evaluated  in  two  (2)  in  vitro  [125I]-
rhBMP-2 binding and release studies. 
Two (2) other in vitro pharmacokinetic studies were also included in the application.

When  compared  with  the  Drug  Product  specification  for  rhBMP-2  content  (11.6-14.8  mg/vial),  the 
results  indicated  that  the  amount  of  [125I]-rhBMP-2  which  binds  to  PEEK  and  allograft  bone  is  a  very 
small amount relative to vial content.

Study PC1064-028 and PC1064-029: These studies  were conducted to investigate in vitro the impact 
of different immersion media or hemostatic agents that are frequently used during spine fusion surgery 
on  rhBMP-2  release  from  the  ACS  matrix.  Across  the  various  immersion  media  used  about  60%  or 
more  of  the  radioactivity  was  retained  on  Day  1,  and  >45%  is  retained  on  day  7-14.  rhBMP-2 
radioactivity  became  associated  with  the  fibrin  clot  and  Tisseel  a  fibrin  based  sealant.  There  was 
minimal association of rhBMP-2 radioactivity with DuraSeal a hydrogel based sealant, while the gelatin 
based  haemostatic  agents,  Gelform  and  Floseal  dissolved  in  the  media.  Both  studies  show  limited 
binding of rhBMP-2 to PEEK. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
Carcinogenicity 
BMPs are known to regulate cell differentiation and growth in some tissues (Reddi, 1998). In addition, 
several  tumours  express BMP  or  BMP  receptors,  including  cancers  of  the  bone,  breast,  lung,  prostate 
and  pancreas  (Thawani,  2010).  As  a  consequence  of  this  potential  risk,  the  use  of  rhBMP-2/ACS  is 
contraindicated  in  patients  with  any  active  malignancy  or  a  patient  undergoing  treatment  for  a 
malignancy. 
The MAH has performed several studies to address this safety concern (see table 3).

Reproduction toxicity 
In  the  initial  MAA,  the  results  from  a  rat  teratology  study  of  rhBMP-2  (Study  95477)  showed 
statistically  significant  reductions  in  the  percentage  of  foetuses  with  sternebral  variants  5  and 
xiphisternum  in  parallel  with  increased  foetal  weights  in  the  treated  groups  leading  to  the  following 
wording in the product information: ”In reproductive toxicity studies in rats, where dibotermin alfa was 
administered intravenously to maximise systemic exposure, increased fetal weight and increased fetal 
ossification was observed and a treatment-related effect could not be ruled out.  The clinical relevance 
of these effects is unknown”.

In Study 95477 animals had been selected for caesarean in a staggered rather than a random fashion 
and  this  may  have  been  responsible  for  the  apparent  trends  in  foetal  maturity.  The  results  from  a 
partial repeat of the same study design (Study 96086), with only the high-dose (1.6 mg/kg/day) and 
vehicle controls groups and with random selection for time of caesarean section confirm  that there is 
no evidence of special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
and repeated exposure toxicity and genotoxicity.  
In clinical studies low levels of transient antibodies to rhBMP-2 have been detected in patients treated 
with InductOs, which raises concerns regarding the potential effects of anti-BMP-2 antibodies on foetal 
development in women of childbearing potential. To assess these concerns antibodies to rhBMP-2 have 
been  investigated  in  pregnant  rabbits  following  immunisation  with  rhBMP-2  (Study  RPT-56475). 
Results from this study showed a greater incidence in reduced ossification of frontal and parietal bones 
than  that  observed  historically  which  was  considered  reversible.  The  current  product  information 
already contains wording reflecting the outcome of this study (procedure II/020 approved in 2006). 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment has been provided in accordance with the CHMP guidance 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (01 June 2006) as proteins are exempted from testing because of their 
chemical structure.  
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A total of ten (10) nonclinical studies were included evaluating the efficacy/biocompatibility, safety and 
compatibility of rhBMP-2 with interbody fusion devices/spacers.  
Titanium devices 
A  total  of  three  (3)  preclinical  studies  have  used  titanium  interbody  devices,  two  (2)  in  the  sheep 
lumbar  interbody  fusion  model;  one  using  ALIF (Sandhu,  2002),  and  one  using  PLIF.  The  third  study 
was in a nonhuman primate model of ALIF (Boden, 1998). All three studies used a 6-month endpoint. 
The use of an rhBMP-2 concentration of 0.43 mg/mL (which is lower than the non-human primate and 
human concentration of 1.5 mg/mL) in the sheep model has been agreed by the CHMP in view of the 
higher sensitivity of sheep to the pharmacological effects of rhBMP-2 compared to man. 
The  titanium  devices  varied  between  the  three  studies,  and  were  all  Medtronic.  Of  the  two  sheep 
studies, one used a horizontal cylindrical threaded device (INTERFIX) made of a titanium alloy (Ti-6A1-
4V) (Sandhu, 2002), and the other used a horizontal cylindrical non-threaded device the (PYRAMESH) 
made  of  grade-2  titanium.  The  primate  study  used  a  horizontal  cylindrical  threaded  device  made  of 
titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) (Boden, 1998).  
Fusion was the main efficacy outcome in all four studies. For rhBMP-2, the rate of histological fusion at 
6 months was 100%, with evidence of fusion as early as 8 weeks (Sandhu, 2002). In contrast, the rate 
of  fusion  was  33–83%  at  6  months  for  ICBG  (Sandhu,  2002),  not  evident  until  6  months  (Sandhu, 
2002).  
Ex vivo tests of biomechanical stiffness suggested some benefit for rhBMP-2 over autograft.  
Only  one  (sheep)  study  documented  safety  outcomes,  recording  an  apparently  unrelated  acute 
inflammatory response. 
PEEK devices 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 12/60 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of five preclinical studies have used PEEK devices, with three of these relevant to the efficacy of 
rhBMP-2  in  lumbar  interbody  fusion.  Two  were  in  the  sheep  lumbar  interbody  fusion  model  (Toth, 
2006).  The  other  was  in  the  sheep  endplate-sparing  interbody  fusion  model  (Bae,  2012),  using 
transpsoas interbody fusion.  
The  PEEK  devices  in  the  three  lumbar-relevant  studies  were  a  threaded  cylindrical  PEEK  interbody 
fusion device (PEEK-OPTIMA, InVibio, Greenville, SC) (Toth, 2006), an impacted PEEK interbody device, 
and a specially designed endplate-sparing impacted PEEK spacer (Bae, 2012). 
In  one  study,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  fusion  rates  for  autograft  (71%)  versus  rhBMP-2 
(100%,  P>0.05)  at  6  months.  The  other  relevant  studies  reported  100%  fusion  at  20  weeks  (Bae, 
2012), and fusion starting at 4 weeks. 
Ex vivo tests of biomechanical stiffness suggested some benefit for rhBMP-2 over autograft. 
Safety outcomes were reported by two of the three lumbar-relevant studies. At 6 months, only a mild 
chronic inflammatory response was present (ASTM F981-93 rating of 0 to 1.0 for all inflammatory cells 
for all implants), with a mean overall host response score of 0.54±0.14 (a score of 1.0 is interpreted 
as  mild)  (Toth,  2006).  The  other  study  found  that  overdosing  with  rhBMP-2  may  be  associated  with 
resorption, but that this was only transient. 
The other two studies are not directly relevant to the topic of efficacy of rhBMP-2 in lumbar interbody 
fusion:  one  was  in  the  sheep  cervical  spine  model,  the  other  was  an  in  vitro  binding  study  using 
radiolabelled rhBMP-2 and a PEEK spacer. 
Allograft spacer 
One preclinical study used a cortical allograft bone dowel (Hecht, 1999) in a nonhuman primate model 
of ALIF. The data are reported descriptively with no ‘fusion’ not clearly defined, but at 6 months 100% 
of the rhBMP-2 group had achieved fusion (based on histology, radiography and CT scan descriptions) 
versus approximately 33–66% of the autograft group. Inflammation was noted in the autograft group, 
whereas in the rhBMP-2 group, no inflammatory or immune response was observed. 
Another  study,  not  directly  relevant  to  the  efficacy  of  rhBMP-2  in  lumbar  interbody  fusion,  was  an in 
vitro binding study using cortical and cancellous bone constructs and radiolabelled rhBMP-2. 
Overview of results from nonclinical studies 
These  nonclinical  studies  report  excellent  rates  of  histological  fusion  for  rhBMP-2  used  with  various 
interbody fusion devices/spacers. The safety findings were either unremarkable, or a generally mild-to-
moderate  chronic  inflammatory  response  that  was  observed  in  both  rhBMP-2  and  autograft  groups, 
and with a variety of interbody fusion devices. 
Four  in  vitro  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  presented  by  the  MAH.  The  data  indicate  that  binding  of 
rhBMP-2  to  PEEK  or  bone  is  relatively  limited.  Furthermore,  immersion  studies  indicate  that 
approximately half of rhBMP-2 is retained on ACS in the first week.  
Studies on the effects of haemostatic agents on rhBMP-2 release from the ACS matrix indicate that a 
relatively large amount of rhBMP-2 becomes associated with Tisseel fibrin sealant. This was less for the 
other  tested  haemostatics.  This  suggested  that  a  physical  barrier  might  be  preferable  over  Tisseel. 
However, this preference does not extend to other haemostatic agents.   
Three genotoxicity studies were submitted. These were all negative.

In  addition,  five  other  studies  (in  vitro,  and  in  vivo)  addressing  the  potential  role  of  rhBMP2  and  its 
receptors  on  tumour  formation  or  outgrowth  were  provided.  Even  though  all  these  studies  do  not 
indicate a concern, there are also studies in the public domain which do suggest a role for rhBMP2 in 
tumour  formation.  This  apparent  dual  behaviour  of  BMP-2  is  adequately  reflected  in  the  currently 
approved product information. The submitted studies have already been reviewed at the time of initial 
MAA or during the lifecycle of the product. No new data have become available, nor new insights been 
obtained.  
Four  studies  have  been  submitted  which  have  been  performed  to  address  clinical  concerns  on  the 
formation  of  fluid  collections  (possibly  leading  to  pseudocysts),  bone  resorption  and  heterotopic 
ossification. No new safety concerns have been identified in these animal studies. 
Considering the above data, Dibotermin alfa is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  aim  of  the  nonclinical  testing  strategy  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy/biocompatibility,  safety  and 
compatibility  of  rhBMP-2  when  implanted  with  interbody  fusion  devices/spacers  made  from  materials 
widely  used  in  humans  for  such  devices/spacers.  The  materials  used  consisted  of  titanium  and 
polyetheretherketone  (PEEK),  of  a  medical  grade  consistent  with  materials  for  CE-marked  interbody 
fusion devices used in humans. This applied to the allograft bone spacers. 
To support the current Type II variation, there were seven (7) animal pharmacology studies (five (5) 
sheep and two (2) nonhuman primate spine fusion model studies). Most studies were reviewed at the 
time of the initial application for the spine indication.  
The limitations of studies  in animal models, specifically due to anatomical differences are recognised. 
Within these limitations, the MAH has provided an adequate package of non-clinical studies to support 
the  proposed  change  in  indication.  The  data  indicate  that  the  use  of  rhBMP-2/ACS  or  bone  graft  in 
combination  with  a  titanium  or  PEEK  device  enhances  spine  fusion  and  stiffness  when  compared  to 
device alone. In these studies the effect of rhBMP-2/ACS appears similar or slightly better than when a 
bone graft was used. An extensive evaluation of the effect of the device, the spinal location or the site 
of  application  (anterior/posterior)  on  bone  fusion  has  not  been  performed.  However  the  data  do  not 
indicate a major effect of any of these variables on bone formation.  
The  available  in  vivo  data  on  human  tumour  cell  lines  do  not  suggest  a  potential  for  promotion  of 
tumour  growth  or  metastasis.  As  a  single  use  product,  InductOs  has  not  been  tested  for  in  vivo 
carcinogenicity. 
The other studies submitted by the MAH do not provide any new cause for concern and do not impact 
on the benefit risk evaluation. 
In conclusion, the requested change in indication is acceptable from a non-clinical point of view.

summary 
Four  ‘pilot’  studies  are  included  (Table  1).  No  formal  statistical  analyses  were  carried  out  for  the 
comparison of efficacy endpoints between treatments in the three controlled pilot studies.  
Two studies were prematurely terminated. The sample size for each study was smaller than expected; 
the planned statistical analyses were not carried out and the studies are best described as ‘supportive’ 
rather than ‘pivotal,’ as stated in their protocols. 
In addition to the studies shown in Table 1, two studies were presented but not further described by 
the MAH (Table 2). Study P01-08 is a large study, including 577 subjects. The study is completed, but 
only a synopsis was presented initially.  
The other study, P05-06, is still ongoing. Total number of subjects to be randomized was 534. The first 
patient  was  enrolled  in  November  2011;  as  of  1  September  2013,  15  subjects  were  enrolled  and 
underwent surgery.

2.3.2.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
This  submission  covers  the  same  formulation  of  InductOs  that  was  previously  approved  in  the  EU  in 
2002. Therefore, the clinical pharmacology program of the original MAA is applicable to this variation. 
In addition, the pharmacodynamic results from animal model studies in sheep and nonhuman primates 
provided histological evidence of fusion with dibotermin alfa at the site of implantation; moreover, the 
bone  formed  is  of  a  higher  quality  (e.g.,  less  fibrosis,  greater  proportion  of  trabecular  bone)  when 
compared  with  ICBG.  This  observation  was  irrespective  of  the  interbody  device/spacer  material 
implanted with dibotermin alfa/ACS. These results provide a mechanistic rationale to explain the lower 
rate  of  pseudarthrosis  observed  in  the  InductOs  treated  patients  in  the  pooled  safety  data  analysis 
when compared with the ICBG-treated patients. 
Furthermore,  the  following  results  from  in  vitro  studies  presented  provide  relevant  information 
regarding potential interaction: 
• Uptake of dibotermin alfa at the site of implantation into fibrin (Study 1064- 029) 
• Use of allograft or local bone to re-create a physical barrier between the matrix and any neurological 
tissue,  if  leakage  into  the  spinal  canal  and  the  nerve  root  is  possible,  is  supported  by  the  minimal 
uptake of dibotermin alfa by allograft or local bone (Study PC-0339) 
Therefore the absence of PK data in this population is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The  aim  of  the  meta-analysis  was  to  evaluate  the  clinical  efficacy  and  effectiveness  of  recombinant 
human  bone  morphogenetic  protein-2/absorbable  collagen  sponge  (rhBMP-2/ACS)  versus  autogenous 
bone  graft  (ABG)  in  lumbar  interbody  fusion  in  patients  with  degenerative  disc  disease  (DDD), 
spondylolisthesis or chronic low back pain. The main hypothesis was that the efficacy of rhBMP-2/ACS 
relative  to  the  use  of  ABG  remains  unchanged  regardless  of  the  interbody  fusion  device  or  surgical 
approach  used.  The  primary  comparison  was  to  be  the  proportion  of  patients  with  radiological  fusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 16/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
success  at  24  months  post-operation  across  the  Medtronic-sponsored  controlled  clinical  trials.  The 
hypothesis  would  also  be tested  in  combination  with  published  data  from  both  randomized  controlled 
trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled studies (NRS). 
Relevant studies were identified by searching Medtronic clinical study reports, bibliographic databases 
(MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library), trial registries (WHO ICTRP) and references of 
retrieved articles. 
Inclusion criteria were controlled trials of rhBMP-2/ACS  versus  ABG with minimum 6-month  follow up 
in  adults  with  degenerative  disc  disease,  spondylolisthesis  or  chronic  low  back  pain  who  were 
undergoing lumbar interbody fusion via any approach and with any interbody fusion device. 
The meta-analysis was conducted in two parts: 
i)  Medtronic-sponsored  RCTs  of  InductOs  in  lumbar  interbody  fusion  compared  with  ICBG  (3100N3-
117, 3100N3-303, C-9703, P00-01, C-9804, and C9806). Two Medtronic-sponsored trials were not 
eligible for the meta-analysis. Study 3100N3-304 was not included because the comparator was a 
concurrent  control  taken  from  another  study,  and  Study  P01-07  was  not  included  because  there 
was no comparator. 
ii)  All  controlled  clinical  trials  (Medtronic-sponsored  or  not,  published  or  unpublished,  randomized  or 
not) of InductOs in lumbar interbody fusion compared with ICBG. 
2.4.1.  Results 
Six  Medtronic-sponsored  trials  and  seven  other  published  studies  were  identified.  The  six  Medtronic-
sponsored trials were RCTs. Only one of the seven  published studies was an  RCT; the other six  were 
NRS.  The  studies  included  a  total  of  585  patients  treated  with  rhBMP-2/ACS  (292  in  Medtronic  trials 
and 293 in non-Medtronic studies) and 422 patients treated with ABG (244 in Medtronic trials and 178 
in  non-Medtronic  studies).  The  data  provided  by  non-Medtronic  published  studies  were  somewhat 
limited. After combining data from Medtronic trials and non-Medtronic published studies, meta-analysis 
was  possible  for  fusion  success,  ODI  score  improvement  and  secondary  procedures.  The  duration  of 
follow-up varied, being 24 months for Medtronic studies and 9–34 months for published studies. 
2.4.1.1.  Fusion success rate for primary analysis set 
Figure  1  shows  the  forest  plot  results  of  meta-analysis  for  the  primary  analysis  dataset  from  the  six 
Medtronic-sponsored RCTs of InductOs compared with ICBG (3100N3-117, 3100N3-303, C-9703, P00-
01, C-9804 and C9806). At 24 months post-surgery, the use of InductOs was associated with a higher 
fusion success rate (94.5%, 241/255) compared with ICBG (84.6%, 177/209). The difference between 
the  two  groups  was  statistically  significant  (OR  3.262,  P=0.024).  The  heterogenecity  across  studies 
was  moderate  (I2  =36.8%,  P=0.161).  The  estimated  absolute  difference  in  fusion  success  rate 
between  the  InductOs  and  ICBG  groups  was  11.7%  (P=0.035);  however,  the  heterogeneity  across 
studies was moderate and statistically significant (I2 =56.2%; P=0.044). The addition of non-Medtronic 
RCT  (one  study)  and  NRS  data  (six  studies)  to  the  Medtronic  CSRs  did  not  affect  the  finding  of  a 
significantly increased fusion success rate for rhBMP-2/ACS versus ABG. 
For  the  primary  analysis  dataset  at  6  and  12  months,  the  fusion  success  rate  was  96.6%  (253/262) 
and  96.1%  (249/259)  respectively,  for  InductOs  and  92.4%  (195/211)  and  91.2%  (195/212) 
respectively, for ICBG, with no significant difference between the groups at either time point. This does 
not support a claim for accelerated fusion.

between  the  InductOs  and  ICBG  groups  was  13.2%  (p=0.034).  Based  on  odds  ratios,  there  was  no 
significant difference in fusion success rate at any time point (p>0.05 for OR at 6 months, 12 months, 
and 24 months).

Effect of surgical approach  
Fusion success rate 
In  a  subgroup  analyses  for  fusion  success  by  surgical  approach  (Figure  2)  for  all  six  anterior  lumbar 
interbody  fusion  studies,  fusion  success  was  92.8%  (221/238)  for  InductOs  compared  with  82.8% 
(173/209)  for  ICBG  (OR  2.29).  This  compares  with  96.8%  (274/283)  and  91.7%  (154/168)  for 
InductOs  and  ICBG,  respectively,  in  all  seven  posterior  studies  (OR  2.12).  A  formal  meta-regression 
analysis found no statistically significant difference in the effect of InductOs on fusion success between 
ALIF and other surgical approaches (ratio of odds ratios ROR=0.863, p=0.847).

Effect of interbody fusion device 
Fusion success rate 
Results  for  the  effect  of  types  of  interbody  devices  are  shown  in  Figure  4.  The  relative  effect  of 
InductOs  was  not  significantly  associated  with  the  types  of  interbody  device  used  (χ2=2.48,  df=6, 
p=0.870). For titanium devices (LT-CAGE or INTER FIX devices, four studies), the InductOs fusion rate 
was  93.0%  (174/187)  and  87.1%  (142/163)  for  ICBG.  For  allograft  spacers  (four  studies),  the 
InductOs fusion rate was 96.3% (156/162), compared with 75.0% (66/88) for ICBG. For PEEK devices, 
the  fusion  rate  was  95.4%  (62/65)  for  InductOs  and  94.6%  (70/74)  for  ICBG.  The  difference  in  the 
effect of InductOs on fusion success was statistically non-significant between being administered with 
an allograft device and other devices (ROR 1.948, p=0.442).

Literature 
The  MAH  selected  20  publications,  including  1730  patients  treated  with  dibotermin  alfa  and  251 
patients receiving other treatments. According to the MAH this literature provides evidence supporting 
the administration of InductOs in approaches other than ALIF (e.g. PLIF or TLIF – 75.6%, 1497/1981), 
with interbody devices other than the LT-CAGE Device (e.g. polymer interbody fusion devices – 53.4%, 
1058/1981), and at levels other than L4-S1. Fusion success rates appear to be consistent with those 
found  in  Medtronic-sponsored  trials  and  independent  of  surgical  approach,  administration  with 
interbody devices other than LT-CAGE Device and lumbar level fused. 
Supportive studies 
In addition to the studies presented in  
Table  1, the efficacy of InductOs administered with interbody fusion devices other than the LT-CAGE 
Device,  in  surgical  techniques  other  than  anterior  lumbar  interbody  fusion  and  implanted  at  lumbar 
levels other than L4-S1 was supported by the following cumulative sets of clinical evidence: 
•  A  post-hoc  meta-analysis  of  six  Medtronic-sponsored  RCTs,  including  Study  3100N3-303, 
comparing  InductOs  (N=292)  and  ICBG  (N=244)  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  Points  to 
Consider on Application with Meta-analysis (CPMP/EWP/2330/99). This permitted an evaluation of 
efficacy  and  effectiveness  across  trials  that  individually  failed  to  reach  the  necessary  statistical 
power. 
•  A sub-group and meta-regression analysis exploring the potential for differences in fusion success 
rates  between  InductOs  (N=544)  and  ICBG  (N=387)  due  to  surgical  approach  (anterior  versus 
posterior)  or  by  type  of  interbody  fusion  device.  The  data  set  included  seven  RCTs  (including  six 
Medtronic-sponsored RCTs) and six non-randomised controlled studies (NRS).  
•  Clinical  synopses  from  20  selected  publications  covering  19  clinical  studies  and  1981  subjects 
(overview  provided  in  Table  3).  The  publications  included  non-Medtronic  RCTs  and  NRS  including 
non-Medtronic publications that did not meet the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In  support  of  the  application,  the  MAH  has  presented  data  from  eight  Medtronic-sponsored  studies, 
data from additional analyses, and clinical synopsis from selected publications covering 19 trials. Four 
of  these  studies  are  pilot  studies,  three  are  supportive  studies,  leaving  one  of  the  studies  as  pivotal 
(3100N3-303).  Studies  3100N3-117,  303  and  304  were  already  presented  with  the  initial  marketing 
authorisation  application  for  the  spinal  fusion  indication.  Important  for  this  application  are  studies 
performed  with  other  devices  than  the  LT-CAGE,  with  other  surgical  techniques  than  ALIF  (Anterior 
Lumbar  Interbody  Fusion)  and  in  other  lumbar  levels  than  L4-S1.  All  these  were  only  investigated  in 
pilot trials or in the supportive trials. 
In addition to these studies, the MAH performed a post-hoc meta-analysis of six Medtronic-sponsored 
trials,  permitting  an  evaluation  of  efficacy  across  trials  that  individually  failed  to  reach  the  necessary 
statistical power. 
Furthermore,  a  sub-group  and  meta-regression  analysis  was  performed  exploring  the  potential  for 
differences in fusion success rates between InductOs and ICBG (Iliac Crest Bone Graft) due to surgical 
approach  (anterior  vs.  posterior)  or  by  type  of  interbody  fusion  device.  The  data  set  included  seven 
RCTs, of which six were Medtronic-sponsored RCTs, and six NRS. 
Results  of  independent  meta-analyses  were  presented  by  the  MAH  in  2012  (post-authorisation 
measure 063.1). During this procedure, two meta-analyses were discussed, one by York University and 
the other by Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). These analyses also included the Medtronic 
sponsored  studies.  The  York  analysis  showed  an  increased  rate  of  fusion  with  rhBMP-2  compared  to 
ICBG.  There  was  also  a  moderate  improvement  in  pain  that  did  not  seem  to  be  the  result  of  the 
increase in fusion. The OHSU meta-analysis concluded that in spinal fusion rhBMP-2 and ICBG appear 
to  be  similarly  effective  when  used  in  ALIF  and  PLF.  The  CHMP’s  overall  conclusion  at  that  time  was 
that efficacy of InductOs was non-inferior or superior compared to standard of care. 
As this application concerns an extension of the indication to all types of surgery for anterior interbody 
fusion,  all  types  of  CE-marked  devices  made  of  titanium  PEEK  or  allograft,  and  all  lumbar  levels,  the 
accent of the assessment is on the subgroup analysis where the type of device and surgical approach 
were  analysed.  Efficacy  and  safety  in  general  were  already  presented  with  the  two  former  meta-
analyses and in the original variation application for spinal surgery.

The  primary  comparison  in  the  meta-analysis  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with  radiological  fusion 
success  at  24  months  post-operation  across  the  Medtronic-sponsored  controlled  clinical  trials.  Fusion 
success rate and failure-related secondary surgery were analysed by surgical approach and by type of 
interbody  device.  Other  parameters,  such  as  Oswestry  Disability  Index  (ODI),  Short  Form  (SF)-36 
score, back pain and leg pain score, neurological success rate, disc height success rate were presented 
by the MAH, but these parameters were not analysed by surgery approach or type of interbody device. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that these data do not contribute to the discussion on benefit/risk of 
surgical approach, type of device and lumbar level, and are not discussed further. 
Two  additional  studies  were  submitted  by  the  MAH.  Study  P01-08  is  a  large  study,  including  577 
subjects.  During  this  procedure  the  MAH  has  submitted  the  Final  study  report  of  study  P01-08 
(MAVERICK  study).  In  this  study  the  MAVERICK  Total  Disc  Replacement  System  was  compared  to 
Spinal  Fusion  (rhBMP-2/ACS  in  LT-Cage)  in  subjects  with  degenerative  disc  disease.  Although 
MAVERICK  was  superior  compared  to  InductOs  for  several  key  outcomes,  there  were  also  some 
adverse events. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the comparison is not valid for this application. 
The other study, P05-06, is still ongoing. Total number of subjects to be randomized was 534. The first 
patient was enrolled on 28 November 2011. Enrolment was suspended on 19 October 2012, due to one 
subject  experiencing  an  expected  AE  (fluid  collection  (wound  seroma))  that  triggered  a  pre-defined 
enrolment suspension criteria and subsequent Data Monitoring Committee review. As of 1 September 
2013,  15  subjects  had  been  enrolled  and  undergone  surgery  (11  subjects  in  the  investigational 
Treatment  group  and  4  subjects  in  the  Control  group).The  main  enrolment  difficulties  were  linked  to 
the Body Mass Index (BMI) criteria, as well as the challenge of enrolling to the control group given it 
was not considered standard of care. The main screen failures were due to patient being osteoporotic, 
having  low  ODI  scores  at  screening  or  having  too  mild  leg  pain  scores.  The  reasons  for  “slow 
enrolment” were acknowledged by the CHMP. 
The MAH performed a literature review to support the clinical trials and meta-analysis described above. 
Twenty  publications,  representing  19  trials,  were  selected.  Seven  studies  were  also  included  in  the 
meta-analysis, reducing the supportive value of this literature review.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The CHMP was of the view that data presented for Fusion Success Rate were in line with the data from 
the previous submitted meta-analyses, as can be expected. 
In the six Medtronic-sponsored trials, at 24 months post-surgery, the use of InductOs was associated 
with a higher fusion success rate (94.5%, 241/255) compared with ICBG (84.6%, 177/209). The 
difference between the two groups was statistically significant (OR 3.262, p=0.024). For the primary 
analysis dataset at 6 and 12 months, the fusion success rate was 96.6% (253/262) and 96.1% 
(249/259) respectively, for InductOs and 92.4% (195/211) and 91.2% (195/212) respectively, for 
ICBG, with no significant difference between the groups at either time point. This did not support a 
claim for accelerated fusion. 
The addition of non-Medtronic RCT (one study) and NRS data (six studies) to the Medtronic CSRs did 
not affect the finding of a significantly increased fusion success rate for rhBMP-2/ACS versus ABG. 
In a subgroup analysis for fusion success by surgical approach (for all six anterior lumbar interbody 
fusion studies), fusion success was 92.8% (221/238) for InductOs compared with 82.8% (173/209) for 
ICBG (OR 2.29). This compares with 96.8% (274/283) and 91.7% (154/168) for InductOs and ICBG,

respectively, in all seven posterior studies (OR 2.12). A formal meta-regression analysis found no 
statistically significant difference in the effect of InductOs on fusion success between ALIF and other 
surgical approaches (ratio of odds ratios ROR=0.863, P=0.847). In this analysis, two studies have 
been changed by mistake (Joseph et al (2007) and Gerszten et al (2011)). The MAH acknowledge that 
the Joseph (Joseph et al. 2007) and Gerszten (Gerszten et al. 2011) studies were indeed incorrectly 
listed in the Meta-analysis report and corrected it. In addition, the MAH re-ran the original search (cut-
off 20 June 2013) to capture eligible studies published up to 2 July 2014. One new non-randomised 
study was identified (Adams et al. 2014) that reported on patients undergoing TLIF or PLIF with 
rhBMP-2 administered using PEEK interbody devices. The CHMP considered that the correction of the 
error in the listing of the Joseph and the Gerszten studies, and the addition of the new Adams study, 
did not change the results in a relevant way. The difference in fusion success rates was unchanged for 
the anterior approach studies (92.8% for InductOs vs 82.8% for ICBG) and was slightly increased for 
PLIF/TLIF (97.1% for InductOs vs 91.6 % for ICBG; previously it was 96.8 % vs 91.7%). 
When analysing the effect of the device, similar results were obtained. The relative effect of InductOs 
was not significantly associated with the types of interbody device used (χ2=2.48, df=6, P=0.870). For 
titanium devices (LT-CAGE or INTER FIX devices, four studies), the InductOs fusion rate was 93.0% 
(174/187) and 87.1% (142/163) for ICBG. For allograft spacers (four studies), the InductOs fusion 
rate was 96.3% (156/162), compared with 75.0% (66/88) for ICBG. For PEEK devices, the fusion rate 
was 95.4% (62/65) for InductOs and 94.6% (70/74) for ICBG. The difference in the effect of InductOs 
on fusion success was statistically non-significant between being administered with an allograft device 
and other devices (ROR 1.948, p=0.442). It is remarkable in these studies that the InductOs fusion 
rate is not dependent on the type of device (93-96%), but the ICBG fusion rate varies from 75-95%. 
The CHMP considered that here too, numbers were small, and it was not possible to draw a firm 
conclusion. 
The CHMP also considered that the results for Failure-related secondary surgery were in line with data 
for fusion success rate.  
In order to increase the number of studies suitable for meta-analysis the MAH, during the procedure, 
widened the inclusion criteria. An additional 30 studies were identified by literature search. Overall, the 
studies available for the supplementary meta-analysis included data from seven randomised controlled 
trials (with ABG (autogenous bone graft) control), seven non-randomised controlled studies (with ABG 
control), and 29 other studies (with no ABG control arm). Together, these 43 studies contributed to 59 
treatment arms (45 rhBMP-2/ACS and 14 ABG arms), with a total of 2586 patients treated with 
rhBMP-2/ACS and 405 patients treated with ABG. 
The statistical methods used for this supplementary meta-analysis were similar to those used in the 
original meta-analysis, and are acceptable. This broader range of studies, including uncontrolled 
studies and studies with a small proportion of patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion for adult 
spinal degenerative deformity, led to considerable heterogeneity. Even though the same amount of 
heterogeneity was found earlier in a similar study, suggesting this heterogeneity reflects the real use 
of the product, the results of this supplementary meta-analysis have to be interpreted with caution. 
Furthermore, a potential problem in meta-analyses is publication bias. By widening the inclusion 
criteria for the supplementary meta-analysis, the risk of publication bias has likely become higher. It is 
therefore possible that the supplementary meta-analysis exaggerates the outcome. Most newly added 
studies were retrospective and uncontrolled. In addition, the definition of radiological fusion varied 
widely in the 30 new studies. These are also limitations of the supplementary meta-analysis. 
For all studies, fusion success rate for rhBMP-2/ACS was 94.0% (95% CI: 91.3-96.3) compared to 
84.5% (95% CI: 80.7-91.4) for autogenous bone graft. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 25/60 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analysis according to surgical procedure revealed no significant differences in fusion success 
rates for the rhBMP-2/ACS group: ALIF 91.6%, PLIF/TLIF 95.0%, Other 95.0%. In the ABG group 
differences approached statistical significance, with ALIF performing least: ALIF 78.5%, PLIF/TLIF 
91.1%, Other 91.8%. The MAH reasons that this may be due to the use of transpedicular screws in 
TLIF/PLIF procedures for achieving segmental fixation and as a consequence high fusion rates. This 
seemed plausible to CHMP, as a stable fixation is important for successful fusion. However, the added 
value of rhBMP-2/ACS in procedures other than ALIF can be questioned. The difference in fusion 
success rates in PLIF/TLIF procedures between rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG is only 4.9%. In the corrected 
meta-analysis, using only controlled studies, the difference in fusion success rates in PLIF/TLIF 
procedures between rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG was 5.5%. The majority of lumbar interbody fusion 
procedures performed in Europe are performed via posterior approaches (PLIF + TLIF) and they 
represented more than 80% of all procedures performed in 2011 compared with ALIF representing less 
than 15% of all procedures. Thus, for Europe, using rhBMP-2/ACS is approved for the ALIF-procedure, 
but this is hardly employed; for the mostly used PLIF-procedure the difference in fusing rate between 
rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG is about 5%. On the other hand, results for rhBMP-2/ACS with PLIF are 
numerically better than the approved rhBMP-2/ACS with ALIF, which supports the PLIF procedure. 
Fusion success rates with rhBMP-2/ACS were not significantly different for interbody device types 
composed of titanium, PEEK, allograft, or other materials (p=0.975), while the difference in fusion 
success between interbody devices in ABG patients was statistically significant (p=0.025). 
In the 30 new studies, there were 17 studies reporting use at L1-L4. However, number of patients 
treated at other levels is not known and outcome data were not stratified for lumbar level. Thus, no 
additional data are available for other levels. For fusion, biological and mechanical environment are 
important. These do not differ much between L1, L2 and L4-S1. For mechanical stability it is required 
that the osseous component of the end-plate remains intact. Difficulties may arise in patients with 
osteoporosis, for whom there may be a loss of bone density in subchondral trabeculae. Overall, factors 
such as osteoporosis, age, and disease severity may influence the nature of the vertebral endplate in 
contact with rhBMP-2/ACS, but these factors are common to all levels of the lumbar spine, with the 
exception that the frequency of disease severity increases caudally. Other anatomical features of the 
endplate vary more within a single disc level than they do at different lumbar levels. 
The CHMP therefore considered that the extension of the indication to: “single-level lumbar interbody 
spine fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who 
have had at least 6 months of non-operative treatment for this condition” is acceptable. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In support of the variation, the MAH has presented data from 8 Medtronic-sponsored studies and data 
from literature. Important for this variation is the post-hoc meta-analysis of 6 Medtronic studies and 
literature, and a subgroup and meta-regression analysis exploring the potential for differences in fusion 
success rates between InductOs and ICBG due to surgical approach (anterior vs posterior) or by type 
of interbody fusion device. The data set included seven RCTs (including six Medtronic RCTs) and six 
non-randomised controlled studies (NRS). 
The post-hoc meta-analysis of 6 controlled clinical trials with data from patients treated with InductOs 
or autogenous bone graft administered using CE-marked interbody fusion devices or allograft bone 
spacers and various surgical approaches showed that, at 24 months post-surgery, InductOs was 
associated with a higher fusion success rate (95 %, 241 out of 255 patients) compared with 
autogenous bone graft (85 %, 177 out of 209 patients), with an odds ratio of 3.26 (95 % CI: 1.172, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 26/60 
 
 
 
 
 
9.075; P = 0.024).  The estimated absolute difference in fusion success rate between InductOs and 
autogenous bone graft was 11.7 % (95 % CI: 8.0 %, 22.5 %; P = 0.035). 
Although the results of this supplementary meta-analysis have to be interpreted with caution, due to 
considerable  heterogeneity,  the  CHMP  considered  that  in  the  EU,  using  rhBMP-2/ACS  is  approved  for 
the ALIF-procedure, but this is hardly employed; for the mostly used PLIF-procedure the difference in 
fusing rate between rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG is about 5%. The fusion success  rates with rhBMP-2/ACS 
were  not  significantly  different  for  interbody  device  types  composed  of  titanium,  PEEK,  allograft,  or 
other materials (p=0.975). 
The CHMP agreed to extend the indication to single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion. 
The CHMP also agreed that InductOs should be used with an approved (CE-marked) lumbar interbody 
fusion device(s) and that compatibility has been demonstrated with titanium, polyetheretherketone 
(PEEK), and allograft bone. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Patient exposure 
Safety analysis included trials presented in  
Table  1. Thus a total of 700 patients were involved, 456 on InductOs and 244 ICBG. The MAVERICK 
study was also not included in the safety analysis.  
Adverse events 
The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  in  patients  at  24  months  was  80.9%  in  the  pooled  InductOs  data, 
compared with 85.7% in the pooled control  data (Table 4). The overall frequency of patients reporting 
(S)AEs,  related  (S)AEs  and  donor  site  complications  were  approximately  4-5%  lower  in  the  pooled 
InductOs group compared with the pooled control group.  
The  overall  frequencies  of  (S)AEs  and  related  (S)AEs  in  patients  between  selected  individual  studies 
representing  different  surgical  approaches,  different  interbody  device  designs  and  materials,  do  not 
raise concerns for InductOs compared with ICBG.

is 
shown 
in  
Table  5.  The  most  frequently  affected  SOC  was  Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders  for 
both investigational and control groups. 
In the pooled study data, Back Pain, Pain in Extremity and Fall were the most frequently occurring AEs 
in patients at 24 months. The most notable finding is the frequency of Pseudarthrosis; the rate of the 
event  in  the  InductOs  group  (6.1%),  compared  with  the  control  (13.1%).  Although  Musculoskeletal 
Pain has a frequency of 8.1% in the investigational group and just 4.9% in the control, Muscle Spasm 
has a frequency of 3.5% in the investigational group and 6.6% in control. An imbalance in the rates of 
Retrograde Ejaculation has been noted previously and is unique to the ALIF surgical procedure. 
Treatment-related AEs 
Pseudarthrosis  was  the  most  frequently  occurring  individual  treatment-related  AE  in  patients  at  24 
months, followed by Device Dislocation in both treatment groups. Frequencies in patients of treatment-

related Pseudarthrosis AEs were 4.8% in the pooled investigational study data compared with 12.7% in 
pooled control study data, representing the effectiveness of dibotermin alfa.  
The frequency of an AE of Device Dislocation in pooled study data was 3.5% in investigational patients 
and 2.5% in control patients at 24 months. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The  frequency  of  each  SAE  by  MedDRA  preferred  term  was  generally  low  and  differences 
unremarkable.  Some  categories  such  as  Musculoskeletal  Pain  (2.0%  INV  versus  0.4  %  CTRL)  and 
Surgical  and  Medical  Procedures  (2.4%  INV  versus  1.2%  CTRL)  were  numerically  higher  in  the  INV 
group,  but  others  such  as  Road  Traffic  Accident  (1.1%  INV  versus  2.5%  CTRL)  and  Respiratory, 
Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (1.3% INV versus 2.5 % CTRL) were numerically lower in the INV 
group. These differences are most likely due to chance. Of note, Pseudarthrosis was 2 times lower in 
the InductOs group compared with autograft control (4.6% versus 8.6%, respectively). 
There were few deaths in all 8 studies throughout the 24-month study duration: 0.2% (1/456) in the 
InductOs  groups,  compared  with  1.6%  (4/244)  for  control.  None  of  the  5  deaths  in  either  treatment 
group was considered to be related to the treatment or the surgical procedure.

Evaluation of undesirable effects in the currently approved SmPC 
Neuralgia 
The currently approved product information states that the most common adverse reaction related to 
the  use  of  InductOs  in  spine  surgery  was  neuralgia.  This  event  was  introduced  in  the  product 
information  based  on  studies  coded in  COSTART  in  which  27  patients  (18.9%)  in  the  InductOs  group 
and 17 patients (12.5%) in the control group had an adverse reaction of Neuralgia. Due to the lack of 
granularity  in  COSTART,  several  neurological  events  were  coded  to  Neuralgia.  The  MAH  has  recently 
recoded the data to MedDRA and pooled the data from 8 relevant studies for  the analysis of adverse 
reactions. This allowed a more precise analysis of the observed events. The frequency of neuralgia with 
InductOs appeared to be similar to that with control: InductOs 0.4% (2 events, 2 patients) vs. Control 
1.6% (4 events, 4 patients).  
Nerve compression/nerve root disorders 
Radiculitis is described in the currently approved product information based on post-market reports. In 
the current pooled analysis, the frequency of radiculitis and radiculopathic events is similar – 6.6% for 
both InductOs and the control group. Table 6 presents the occurrence of radiculitis/radiculopathy in the 
pooled study data by surgical approach.

The  adverse  event  Back  Pain  was  very  common  in  both  groups  (24-28%).  This  is  anticipated,  even 
after treatment, and both groups report this event. Only a few of the cases were considered treatment-
related.  
Device migration 
Assessment report

The currently approved product information states that device migration is commonly observed during 
use in anterior lumbar spine surgery.  
In  the  pooled  data  there  is  slightly  more  device  migration  (Device  Dislocation  and  Device  Extrusion) 
reported in the investigational group than in the control group (3.7% vs 2.5%). These issues with the 
medical device used may be due to the device itself or the techniques used by the surgeon.  
Resorption Bone Increased 
Bone  resorption  is  normal  part  of  the  bone  remodelling  process  and  osteoclastic  activity  is  a 
component of the mode of action of dibotermin alfa to form new bone.  
In a higher-dose prospective observational study of the PLIF surgical approach, InductOs (12 mg) was 
associated with transient, asymptomatic vertebral endplate resorption in 17/17 patients.  
Table  7  provides  the  overall  frequency  for  bone  resorption  increased  and  pseudarthrosis  from  pooled 
study data.

Heterotopic ossification 
The  frequency  of  heterotopic  ossification  in  relation  to  surgical  approach  is  shown  in  Table  8.  For 
subjects who underwent an ALIF procedure, similar frequencies are found in the investigational group 
(2.0%;  8/392)  and  the  control  group  (1.9%;  4/211).  However,  for  subjects  who  underwent  a  PLIF 
procedure, there is a difference. In the investigational group a frequency of 7.8% (5/64 subjects) was 
found compared with 0% (0/33 subjects) in the control group.

Fluid Collection 
The  event  of  fluid  collection  and  cyst/pseudocyst  was  previously  added  to  the  product  information 
based on post-market reports and a potential causal link between effusion/oedema and administration 
of  the  product.    Animal  studies  suggested  it  to  be  a  possible  dose-related  response  linked  with  the 
initial pro-inflammatory or angiogenic activity of dibotermin alfa.  
When reviewing the events describing fluid collection and cyst/pseudocyst in the pooled study data, a 
higher frequency was  found for the control group compared to the investigational group (1.2%versus 
0.7%, respectively). In a recently published systematic review (Brown et al., 2013), two papers were 
examined for the relative risk of inflammatory cyst formation for InductOs compared with control. Only 
one  paper  was  found  with  sufficient  evidence  to  draw  a  conclusion.  The  study  was  a  retrospective 
analysis of medical records (Williams et al., 2011). There were 43 inflammatory cyst formation events 
out of a total of 18 267 events. There was no evidence of a difference in inflammatory cyst formation 
(RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.59; 1.89) between treatment with and  without InductOs in this  study (Brown et 
al., 2013). 
Pseudarthrosis 
The  frequency  of  Pseudarthrosis  in  the  pooled  study  data  was  approximately  2-fold  lower  in  the 
InductOs  group  compared  with  control  patients  at  24  months  for  both  anterior  and  posterior  surgical 
approaches (Table 9).

The currently approved product information contains a warning in Section 4.4 that both dibotermin alfa 
and  bovine  type  I  collagen  have  been  found  to  elicit  immune  responses  in  patients.  The  MAH  has 
conducted  an  extensive  review  of  the  information  on  the  immune  response  to  dibotermin  alfa  and 
bovine type I collagen from both Medtronic-sponsored and Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials.  
Of the 17 dibotermin alfa spinal studies with antibody testing conducted by Medtronic, three out of the 
40 patients with positive dibotermin alfa antibody titres were judged to be fusion failures, and two of 
these were control patients who did not receive dibotermin alfa. Within these spine fusion studies, 32

out  of  the  33  investigational  patients  (97%)  fused  successfully  in  the  presence  of  antibodies  to 
dibotermin alfa. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse  events  for  InductOs  (n=456)  and  control  groups  (n=244)  in  all  8  studies  were  pooled  to 
improve the accuracy of the estimation of AE frequencies at the MedDRA preferred term level. A range 
of doses of dibotermin alfa was used (3.9 to 16.8 mg at 1.5 mg/mL), extending beyond the maximum 
recommended  dose  of  8  mg  for  this  indication;  both  anterior  and  posterior  surgical  approaches  were 
employed; different interbody devices were used. 
No  statistical  analyses  were  performed  comparing  the  frequency  of  AEs  in  the  pooled  InductOs  and 
control  group  data.  Several  AEs  with  numerically  higher  or  lower  frequencies  in  the  pooled  InductOs 
group were highlighted. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified.  
In  the  pooled  safety  data  analysis  of  8  clinical  trials  at  24  months  post-surgery,  the  frequency  of 
patients with pseudarthrosis was approximately 2-fold lower following treatment with InductOs (4.8 %, 
22 out of 456 patients) compared with autogenous bone graft (12.7 %, 31 out of 244 patients).  
The currently approved product information states that the most common adverse reaction related to 
the  use  of  InductOs  in  spine  surgery  was  neuralgia.  This  event  was  introduced  in  the  product 
information  based  on  studies  coded in  COSTART  in  which  27  patients  (18.9%)  in  the  InductOs  group 
and 17 patients (12.5%) in the control group had an adverse reaction of Neuralgia. Due to the lack of 
granularity  in  COSTART,  several  neurological  events  were  coded  to  Neuralgia.  The  MAH  has  recently 
recoded the data to MedDRA and pooled the data from 8 relevant studies for  the analysis of adverse 
reactions. This allowed a more precise analysis of the observed events. The frequency of neuralgia with 
InductOs appeared to be similar to that with control: InductOs 0.4% (2 events, 2 patients) vs. Control 
1.6% (4 events, 4 patients). The MAH therefore proposed to delete ‘Neuralgia’ as an adverse reaction 
from section 4.8. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Radiculitis is described in the currently approved product information based on post-market reports. In 
the current pooled analysis, the frequency of radiculitis and radiculopathic events is similar – 6.6% for 
both InductOs and the control group. The frequency of radiculitis/radiculopathy seemed slightly higher 
when the posterior surgical approach was used (PLIF), based on the pooled study data. The frequency 
is consistent with the literature. The use of threaded dowels and cages for PLIF has been reported in 
the  literature  to  be  associated  with  postoperative  radiculopathy  in  up  to  13%  of  cases.  The  MAH 
considered  there  is  a  potential  causal  link  between  radiculitis/radiculopathy  and  the  use  of  InductOs. 
The  MAH  proposed  to  add  the  following  terms  to  radiculitis  in  the  table  in  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC: 
Lumbar Radiculopathy, Radicular Pain, Radiculitis Lumbosacral, Radiculopathy and Sciatica. This group 
of terms occurs commonly with a frequency of 6.6%. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
The  adverse  event  Back  Pain  was  very  common  in  both  groups  (24-28%).  This  is  anticipated,  even 
after treatment, and both groups report this event. Only a few of the cases were considered treatment-
related. The MAH was the opinion that this event is a common condition in the target population and 
not causally related to the use of InductOs. Given the lack of causality and the similar incidence in both 
the InductOs and the control group, the MAH proposed to remove this event from the table in Section 
4.8 of the SmPC. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
In  the  pooled  data  there  is  slightly  more  device  migration  (Device  Dislocation  and  Device  Extrusion) 
reported in the investigational group than in the control group (3.7% vs 2.5%). These issues with the 
medical device used may be due to the device itself or the techniques used by the surgeon. However, a 
contributory  factor  from  use  of  InductOs  cannot  be  excluded.  Post-market  reports  have  suggested  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 34/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
link  between  bone  resorption  (radiolucency)  and  device  dislocation.  The  frequency  in  the  approved 
product  information  correctly  reflects  the  frequency  observed  in  the  pooled  study  data;  hence  no 
change  was  proposed  by  the  MAH.  However,  the  MAH  has  updated  the  wording  to  the  up-to-date 
Preferred Term “Device Dislocation”. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
In  the  pooled  study  data,  the  number  of  Osteolysis  and  Resorption  Bone  Increased  events  was  very 
low  and  a  comparison  between  the  investigational  and  the  control group  is difficult  to  make.  Overall, 
publications report a range of frequencies for osteolysis from 0% to 100% associated with the use of 
InductOs  in  lumbar  interbody  fusion  administered  using  either  an  anterior  or  posterior  surgical 
approach (and may not necessarily have any adverse clinical consequences). Given the wide range of 
frequencies  observed  the  MAH  proposed  to  keep  both  ‘Osteolysis’  and  ‘Bone  Resorption  Increased’ 
terms in the SmPC and the frequency as ‘unknown’. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
A detailed post-hoc radiological assessment of the rate of heterotopic ossification was conducted for 
Study P01-07 and Study C-9806. In both studies the majority of patients showed radiographic 
evidence of heterotopic ossification. This may indicate that a causal relationship between exposure to 
InductOs and heterotopic ossification is made more likely by the posterior surgical approach. The 
currently approved product information states that when DDD was treated by a posterior lumbar 
interbody fusion procedure with cylindrical threaded cages and dibotermin alfa, posterior bone 
formation was observed in some instances. The proposed product information keeps the warning but 
removes the reference to a specific interbody fusion device and states:” In clinical trials when 
degenerative disc disease was treated by a posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure with 
dibotermin alfa, posterior bone formation was observed”. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
The event of fluid collection and cyst/pseudocyst was previously added to the product information 
based on post-market reports and a potential causal link between effusion/oedema and administration 
of the product.  Animal studies suggest it to be a possible dose-related response linked with the initial 
pro-inflammatory or angiogenic activity of dibotermin alfa. When reviewing the events describing fluid 
collection and cyst/pseudocyst in the pooled study data, a higher frequency was found for the control 
group compared to the investigational group (1.2%versus 0.7%, respectively). In a recently published 
systematic review (Brown et al., 2013), two papers were examined for the relative risk of 
inflammatory cyst formation for InductOs compared with control. Only one paper was found with 
sufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. The study was a retrospective analysis of medical records 
(Williams et al., 2011). There were 43 inflammatory cyst formation events out of a total of 18 267 
events. There was no evidence of a difference in inflammatory cyst formation (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.59; 
1.89) between treatment with and without InductOs in this study (Brown et al., 2013). 
The MAH took the view that a causal link between fluid collection and the known pharmacology of 
dibotermin alfa is possible. The frequency of these events may be estimated as ‘common’. Therefore, 
the MAH proposed to change the table in Section 4.8 accordingly. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
To  better  characterise  the  safety  profile,  the  Medtronic  Clinical  trial  safety  database  was  pooled  by 
surgical approach, i.e. ALIF and PLIF. In general, more patients in the PLIF group experienced AEs as 
compared  to  the  ALIF  group.  However,  there  were  no  differences  between  rhBMP-2/ACS  treated 
subjects and ABG subjects.  
The  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  with  the  most  reported  adverse  events  was  Musculoskeletal  and 
Connective Tissue Disorders in both groups, with 441 events in 208 subjects for ALIF and 158 events 
in 51 subjects for PLIF. The SOC Nervous System Disorders ranked second with regards to number of 
reported  events  (ALIF:  115  events  in  85  subjects;  PLIF:  46  events  in  29  subjects).  There  were  no 
important differences between rhBMP-2/ACS treated patients and ABG treated patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 35/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparison  of  the  other  events  from  the  ALIF  and  PLIF  trials  showed  that  the  differences 
predominantly reflect the known potential risks of the two specific surgical approaches and that these 
surgical risks are independent of the use of rhBMP-2/ACS.  
An  exception  is  pseudoarthrosis,  occurring  less  frequently  in  rhBMP-2/ACS  subjects  as  compared  to 
controls in both ALIF and PLIF. 
Furthermore, the risk for heterotopic ossification is an acknowledged risk with spinal surgery in general 
and PLIF in particular. With respect to the occurrence after lumbar interbody fusion with rhBMP-2/ACS 
three  sources  of  evidence  were  discussed  by  the  MAH:  1)  Medtronic  clinical  trials,  2)  Published 
literature  reports,  and  3)  Post-marketing  adverse  drug  reaction  reports.  Medtronic  clinical  trial  data 
showed that, as a whole, even with increased rates of radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, 
reoperation rates were not increased and overall clinical outcomes were not worse for rhBMP-2-treated 
patients  than  control  patients.  Following  surgery  with  rhBMP-2  in  posterior  approaches,  the  risk  of 
symptomatic heterotopic ossification (mostly requiring surgery) varies from 0.59% to 6.7% (Rihn et al. 
2009, Crandall et al. 2013, Pimenta et al. 2013, Singh et al. 2013, Adams et al. 2014, Nandyala et al. 
2014). 
The  MAH  proposed  an  update  of  the  product  information  with  more  detailed  instructions  regarding 
administration/handling of the product. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
The  indication  anterior  lumbar  spine  fusion  was  approved  in  the  EU  in  2005.  During  the  procedure, 
there  were  spontaneous  reports  from the  US  of  localised oedema  following  unlicensed  use  in  cervical 
spine  fusion  procedures.  The  SmPC  has  therefore  been  updated  with  warnings  on  type  of  surgery, 
device and spinal level. The MAH also analysed the spontaneous cases possibly linked to cervical spine 
surgery  (all  originating  from  US)  and  no  new  safety  finding  was  observed.  It is  agreed  with  the  MAH 
that  the  number  of  cervical  off-label  use  cases  is  low  at  the  moment,  in  the  context  of  1.3  million 
patients  exposed,  however  this  might  also  be  due  to  underreporting  and  the  real  rates  might  be 
higher.  The  MAH  will  therefore  continue  monitoring  the  off-label  use  of  InductOs  and  report  it  in 
PSURs, which is accepted by the CHMP.  
In general, more patients in the PLIF group experienced AEs as compared to the ALIF group. However, 
there  were  no  differences  between  rhBMP-2/ACS  treated  subjects  and  ABG  subjects.  The  risk  of 
heterotopic  ossification  can  be  adequately  minimised  by  informing  the  HCPs  on  how  to  correctly  use 
this product, by taking care not to overfill, prevent leakage and create a physical barrier between the 
device and neurological tissue. The update of the SmPC and MAH’s proposals for risk minimisation are 
considered adequate by the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. The overall frequency of AEs in patients at 24 
months was 80.9% in the pooled InductOs data, compared with 85.7% in the pooled control data. In 
the pooled study data, back pain, pain in extremity and fall were the most frequently occurring AEs in 
patients at 24 months.  The most notable finding is the frequency of pseudarthrosis; the rate of the 
event in the InductOs group (6.1%), compared with the control (13.1%). Although musculoskeletal 
pain has a frequency of 8.1% in the investigational group and just 4.9% in the control, muscle spasm 
has a frequency of 3.5% in the investigational group and 6.6% in control. An imbalance in the rates of 
retrograde ejaculation has been noted previously and is unique to the ALIF surgical procedure. 
The Medtronic Clinical trial safety database was pooled by surgical approach, i.e. ALIF and PLIF. In 
general, more patients in the PLIF group experienced AEs as compared to the ALIF group. However, 
there were no differences between rhBMP-2/ACS treated subjects and ABG subjects.  
Assessment report

The System Organ Class (SOC) with the most reported adverse events was Musculoskeletal and 
Connective Tissue Disorders in both groups, with 441 events in 208 subjects for ALIF and 158 events 
in 51 subjects for PLIF.  The SOC Nervous System Disorders ranked second with regards to number of 
reported events (ALIF: 115 events in 85 subjects; PLIF: 46 events in 29 subjects). There were no 
important differences between rhBMP-2/ACS treated patients and ABG treated patients. 
Data from Medtronic trials showed that, even with increased rates of radiographic evidence of 
heterotopic ossification, clinical outcomes were not different for rhBMP-2/ACS treated subjects. The 
MAH proposed an update of the product information with more detailed instructions regarding 
administration/handling of the device. In addition, other risk minimisation measures have been 
proposed (see RMP and PRAC report), which are considered sufficient. 
Comparison of the other events from the ALIF and PLIF trials shows that the differences predominantly 
reflect the known potential risks of the two specific surgical approaches and that these surgical risks 
are independent of the use of rhBMP-2/ACS.  
An exception is pseudarthrosis, occurring less frequently in rhBMP-2/ACS subjects as compared to 
controls in both ALIF and PLIF.

the intervertebral disc space. 
Heterotopic ossification 
Bone formation outside the intervertebral disc space is not 
desirable as it may have a deleterious impact on local 
neurovascular structures.  
In clinical trials when degenerative disc disease was treated 
by a posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure with 
dibotermin alfa, posterior bone formation was observed in 
CT scans. In some cases it may lead to nerve compression 
potentially requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.8). 
As a precaution, a physical barrier between the matrix and 
any neurological tissue must be re-created (see section 
4.2).” 
Listed (frequency common) and described in section 
4.8: 
“Heterotopic ossification includes exostosis, extraskeletal 
ossification, postoperative heterotopic calcification, bone 
formation increased and implant site calcification. 
(…) 
New bone formation and bone remodelling 
As part of the pharmacological mechanism of action of 
dibotermin alfa, bone remodelling occurs (see section 5.1). 
In this process, both bone resorption and formation occur. In 
some circumstances an exaggeration of these processes can 
lead to complications such as nerve compression (due to 
heterotopic ossification).  
(…) 
During two years follow-up in clinical trials for lumbar 
interbody fusion using a posterior approach, heterotopic 
ossification seen on radiographs occurred more often in 
patients treated with InductOs compared with autograft (see

Implantation 
As per standard practice, Ddisc material and the cartilaginous portions of the vertebral endplates 
should be removed, preserving the cortical portions of the endplates, and haemostasis should be 
achieved (see section 4.5)as per standard practice. 
For instructions of to implantation the lumbar interbody fusion device of the LT-CAGE Lumbar 
Tapered Fusion Device, please refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for use package leaflet for 
the LT-CAGE device.  
InductOs must not be implanted posterior to the lumbar interbody fusion device, where 
direct access to the spinal canal and/or nerve root(s) is possible. If leakage into the spinal 
canal and the nerve root is possible, a physical barrier between the matrix and any 
neurological tissue must be re-created by using, for example, local bone or allograft (see 
section 4.5).   
Post-implantation  
Once InductOs and the lumbar interbody fusion LT-CAGE device(s) are implanted, do not irrigate 
the inside of the intervertebral disc space should must not be irrigated. Outside the 
intervertebral disc space, the surgical field should be irrigated as needed, and any fluid loss 
from the wetted matrix should be washed away. 
If a surgical drain is required, place the drain should be placed remotely from the implantation site or, 
preferably, one layer superficially to the implantation site. 
Acute tibia fracture surgery Instructions for use in acute tibia fractures  
Pre-implantation 
Achieve dDefinitive fracture reduction, fixation, and haemostasis should be achieved prior to 
InductOs implantation. 
InductOs does not provide mechanical stability and should not be used to fill spaces in the presence of 
compressive forces. 
Fold or cut InductOs should be folded or cut as needed prior to implantation. If the surgical setting 
requires that only a portion of the product is needed, first prepare the entire InductOs product (see 
section 6.6), cut the product to the desired size, and discard the unused portion. 
Implantation 
InductOs is implanted after the completion of standard fracture and wound management, (i.e. at the 
time of soft-tissue closure).  
To the extent possible, the accessible surface area of the fracture (fracture lines and defects) should be 
covered with InductOs. Place InductOs should be placed so that it bridginges the fracture region and

makinges good contact with the major proximal and distal fragments. It is not necessary to overlay 
the contents of multiple kits to achieve the desired effect. 
InductOs may be placed into a void (loosely packed), folded, rolled, or wrapped, as the geometry of 
the fracture requires. InductOs does not provide mechanical stability and should not be used 
to fill a void in the presence of compressive forces. 
Post-implantation 
Once InductOs is implanted, do not irrigate the wound. 
If a surgical drain is required, place the drain should be placed remotely from the implantation site or, 
preferably, one layer superficially to the implantation site. 
In order tTo achieve maximum potential efficacy, it is important to achieve attain complete soft-tissue 
coverage of InductOs following its implantation.

Special warnings and precautions for use 
Failure to follow the product preparation instructions in section 6.6 and the method of 
administration in section 4.2 product preparation instructions for InductOs may compromise the its 
safety and efficacy ofectiveness InductOs. Care and caution should be used to prevent overfilling of 
the construct and/or intervertebral space. 
Cervical spine surgery 
The safety and efficacy of InductOs in cervical spine surgery have not been established, and 
InductOs should not be used in this condition. Localised oedema associated with the use of 
InductOs has been reported in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery. The oedema was delayed in 
onset and usually occurred in the first week post-operation. In some cases, the oedema was severe 
enough to result in airway compromise. The safety and efficacy of InductOs in cervical spine surgery 
have not been established, and InductOs should not be used in this condition. 
Malignancyies 
InductOs should not be used in patients with history or clinical suspicion of malignancy at the site of 
application (see section 4.3). 
Formation of fluid collections 
Formation of fluid collections (pseudocysts, localised oedema, implant site effusion), sometimes 
encapsulated, in some cases resulting in nerve compression and pain, has been reported in patients 
undergoing spine surgery associated with the use of InductOs. Many of these reports have occurred 
when InductOs was used in unapproved approaches/devices or in a manner inconsistent with the 
instructions for use. Clinical intervention (aspiration and/or surgical removal) may be required if 
symptoms persist (see section 4.8). 
Heterotopic ossification 
Use of InductOs may cause heterotopic ossification at the site of implantation and/or the 
surrounding tissues, which may result in complications. 
Bone resorption increased 
InductOs can cause initial resorption of surrounding trabecular bone as evidenced by radiolucency. 
Therefore, in the absence of clinical data, the product should not be used for direct applications to 
trabecular bone wheren transient bone resorption may create a risk of bone fragility (see section 
4.8). When InductOs was used with the LT-CAGE device (section 4.2) in clinical trials for anterior 
lumbar spine fusion, the frequency and severity of resorption of bone as evidenced by radiolucencies 
and/or device migration was similar to that observed for patients treated with autogenous bone graft.  
Fluid collections 
Formation of a fluid collection (pseudocyst, localised oedema, implant site effusion), 
sometimes encapsulated and in some cases resulting in nerve compression and pain, has 
been reported associated with the use of InductOs. Clinical intervention (aspiration and/or 
surgical removal) may be required if symptoms persist (see section 4.8).

Heterotopic ossification 
Use of InductOs may cause heterotopic ossification in the surrounding tissues, which can result in 
complications. Exuberant bone formation at the site of implantation and ectopic bone formation have 
been observed. 
Nerve compression 
Nerve compression associated with ectopic bone formation and InductOs use has been reported (see 
section 4.8). Additional surgical intervention may be required. 
Device migration 
Device migration can occur after the use of InductOs in spinal fusion surgery, which may necessitate 
surgical revision (see section 4.8). 
Immune response 
Both dibotermin alfa and bovine Type I collagen have been found to elicit immune responses in 
patients.  
Anti-dibotermin alfa antibodies: In anterior lumbar spine fusion studies, 0.71.3% of patients receiving 
InductOs developed antibodies to dibotermin alfa versus 0.8% of patients receiving autogenous bone 
graft. In long-boneacute tibia fracture studies, 4.46.3 % of patients receiving InductOs dibotermin 
alfa with bovine Type I bovine collagen matrix developed antibodies to dibotermin alfa versus 
0.61.3 % in the control group. All patients who were tested for neutralizing antibodies to bone 
morphogenetic protein-2 were negative. 
Anti-bovine Type I collagen antibodies: In anterior lumbar spine fusion studies, 1913.5 % of patients 
receiving InductOs developed antibodies to bovine Type I collagen versus 1314.3 % of patients 
receiving autogenous bone graft. In long-boneacute tibia fracture studies, 15.713.0 % of patients 
receiving InductOs dibotermin alfa with bovine Type I bovine collagen matrix developed 
antibodies to bovine Type I collagen versus 11.85.3 % of control patients. None of the patients with 
positive titers to bovine Type I collagen had cross-reacting antibodies to human type I 
collagen.In either of the two indications, no patients who tested positive for anti-bovine Type I 
collagen antibodies developed antibodies to human Type I collagen. 
Although no clear association with clinical outcome or undesirable effects could be observed in clinical 
studies, the possibility of developing neutralising antibodies or hypersensitivity-type reactions cannot 
be excluded. The possibility of an immune response to the product should be considered in 
cases where an undesirable effect with immunological background is suspected. Special 
consideration of risks and benefits should be given for patients who have previously received injectable 
collagen (see section 4.3). In the absence of any experience, the repeat use of InductOs is not 
recommended.The possibility of an immune response to the product should be evaluated in cases 
where an undesirable effect with immunological background is suspected.  
Special populations 
The safety and efficacy of the use of InductOs in patients with known autoimmune disease have not 
been established. These autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis/polymyositis. 
The safety and efficacy of InductOs have not been demonstrated in patients with metabolic bone 
diseases. 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic, or renal or cardiac impairment.  
For all these patient groupsspecial populations, the physician is advised to give a carefull- 
consideration to the benefits and risks for the specific patient before using InductOs. A close 
monitoring of the patient for any adverse reactions and the success of the treatment is recommended.

Special warnings and precautions for use specific to anterior lumbar spine interbody fusion 
The safety and efficacy of InductOs have not been established in the following conditions:  
• 
used with spinal implants interbody fusion devices made from material other than titanium, 
PEEK or bone the LT-CAGE device  
implanted at locations other than L4 – S1 in the lower lumbar spine  
used in surgical techniques other than anterior open or anterior laparoscopic approacheslumbar 
interbody fusion  
• 
• 
When degenerative disc disease was treated by a posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure with 
cylindrical threaded cages and dibotermin alfa, posterior bone formation was observed in some 
instances. 
To avoid exaggerated pharmacological effects of InductOs, care and caution should be used 
to prevent overfilling the lumbar interbody fusion device and/or the anterior portion of the 
intervertebral disc space. 
Heterotopic ossification 
Bone formation outside the intervertebral disc space is not desirable as it may have a 
deleterious impact on local neurovascular structures.  
In clinical trials when degenerative disc disease was treated by a posterior lumbar interbody 
fusion procedure with dibotermin alfa, posterior bone formation was observed in CT scans. 
In some cases it may lead to nerve compression potentially requiring surgical intervention 
(see section 4.8). As a precaution, a physical barrier between the matrix and any 
neurological tissue mustshould be re-created (see section 4.2).  
Device dislocation 
Device dislocation can occur after the use of InductOs in spinal fusion surgery that may 
necessitate surgical revision (see section 4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In acute tibia fracture clinical trials, more InductOs patients receiving concomitant NSAIDs 
for 14 consecutive days experienced mild or moderate adverse events related to wound 
healing (e.g., wound drainage) than InductOs patients not taking NSAIDs. Although patient 
outcome was not affected, an interaction between NSAIDs and InductOs cannot be excluded. 
Information from clinical studies in acute tibia fractures indicated that the use of InductOs in patients 
receiving glucocorticoids was not associated with any apparent adverse reactions. In prenon-clinical 
studies, concurrent administration of glucocorticoids depressed bone repair (measured as a % change 
from control), but the effects of InductOs were not altered.  
In an in vitro study, dibotermin alfa was shown to bind to fibrin-based haemostatic agents 
or sealants. The use of these products in close proximity to InductOs is not recommended as 
this may lead to bone formation at the site of implant of the fibrin-based haemostatic agent 
or sealant (see section 4.2).In acute tibia fracture clinical trials, more InductOs patients receiving 
concomitant NSAIDs for 14 consecutive days experienced mild or moderate adverse events related to 
wound healing (e.g. wound drainage) than InductOs patients not taking NSAIDs. Although patient 
outcome was not affected, an interaction between NSAIDs and InductOs cannot be excluded. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential 
There is no adequate or limited amount of data from the use of dibotermin alfa in pregnant women.  
Studies in aAnimals studies are insufficient with respect to have shown reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Animal studies have been conducted that cannot rule out effects of anti-dibotermin alfa antibodies on 
embryo-foetal development (see section 5.3).   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 50/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the unknown risks to the foetus associated with the potential development of neutralising 
antibodies to dibotermin alfa, InductOs is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception (see section 4.4) InductOs should not be used 
during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (see section 4.4).  Women of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use effective contraception up to at least 12 months after treatment.

Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions related to the use offor InductOs in lumbar interbody fusion 
surgery were neuralgia radiculopathic events, in spine surgery and in acute tibia fracture 
surgery it was localised infection in tibia fracture repair. The most severe adverse reaction is localised 
oedema in cervical spine surgery. The incidence of adverse reactions with InductOs was not affected by 
gender, age or race. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Over 16700 patients have received InductOs in clinical studies. In the long-bone fracture studies, over 
500485 patients received InductOs. In spine lumbar interbody fusion studies, almost 900 over 600 
patients received InductOs. The last group ofThe remaining patients participated in studies using 
InductOs for indications not currently approved in the EU. These data are supplemented with 
information from use of InductOs in the general population.  
The frequency of adverse reactions in patients exposed to treatment with InductOs is presented in the 
table below. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10) or common (≥1/100 to <1/10). No 
reactions are observed with the frequency uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100),  rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).  
The frequencies of adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use of InductOs are not known 
as these reactions were reported from a population of uncertain size.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
New bone formation and bone remodellingBone remodeling 
As part of the pharmacological mechanism of action of InductOs dibotermin alfa, bone remodelling 
occurs (see section 5.1). In this process, both bone resorption and formation occur. In some 
circumstances an exaggeration of these processes can lead to complications such as nerve 
compression (due to bone formation or heterotopic calcificationossification) or device migration 
dislocation (associated with bone resorption or osteolysis).  
During two years follow-up in clinical trials for lumbar interbody fusion using a posterior 
approach, heterotopic ossification seen on radiographs occurred more often in patients 
treated with InductOs compared with autograft (see section 4.4). This radiographic finding 
may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. 
Localised infection 
Localised infection specific to the fractured limb occurred very common (>1/10) in patients in a clinical 
study in which the intramedullary canal was reamed to cortical chatter. An increased rate of infection 
was observed in the InductOs-treated group versus the standard of care control group (19% versus 
9%, respectively; see section 4.4). For use with unreamed nails, estimated rates of infection were 
similar between treatment groups in a study (21% versus 23%, respectively). 
Fluid collection (localised oedema, pseudocyst, implant site effusion) 
Due to the angiogenic activity of InductOs, formation of fluid collections (pseudocyst, localised oedema, 
implant site effusion) can occur, sometimes encapsulated, sometimes resulting in nerve compression 
and/or pain. 
Localised oedema is was observed very common when InductOs is was used for spinal cervical spine 
fusion in the cervical spine. The oedema was delayed in onset and, in some cases, severe enough to 
result in airway compromise (see section 4.4). 
Localised infection 
Localised infection specific to the fractured limb was very common (≥1/10) in patients in a 
clinical study in which the intramedullary canal was reamed to cortical chatter. An increased 
rate of infection was observed in the InductOs-treated group versus the standard of care 
control group (19 % versus 9 %, respectively; see section 4.4). For use with unreamed nails, 
estimated rates of infection were similar between treatment and control groups in a study 
(21 % versus 23 %, respectively). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is 
important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal 
product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via 
the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
In case of overdose (i.e. a patient receives a concentration or amount of dibotermin alfa 
greater than recommended), treatment should be supportive. 
Use of InductOs in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery in concentrations or amounts lower 
than or similar togreater than those recommended in section 4.2for the approved indications lumbar 
interbody fusion has been associated with reports of localised oedema severe enough to result in 
airway compromise (see section 4.4).

In the case of patients receiving concentrations or amounts greater than those recommended, 
treatment should be supportive. 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
5.1 
Remodeling of the surrounding trabecular bone occurs in a manner that is consistent with the 
biomechanical forces placed on it. Placement of InductOs into trabecular bone resulted in transient 
resorption of the bone surrounding the implant, followed by replacement with new, more dense bone. 
Remodeling of the surrounding bone occurs in a manner that is consistent with the 
biomechanical forces placed on it. The ability of InductOs to support bone remodeling may be 
responsible for the biological and biomechanical integration of the new bone induced by InductOs with 
that of the surrounding bone. Radiographic, biomechanical and histologic evaluation of the induced 
bone indicates that it functions biologically and biomechanically as native bone. Furthermore, 
preclinical non-clinical studies have indicated that the bone induced by InductOs, if fractured, can 
repair itself in a manner indistinguishable from native bone. 
Histological evidence from animal studies of lumbar interbody fusion using anterior or 
posterior surgical approaches showed dibotermin alfa administered with titanium, PEEK or 
allograft interbody devices was biocompatible and produced consistently high rates of 
fusion independent of surgical approach or device material with less fibrous tissue evident 
compared with autograft. 
Pharmacodynamic information specific to anterior lumbar spine interbody fusion studies 
The efficacy and safety of InductOs were demonstrated in a randomised, controlled, multicenter, 
non-inferiority study of 279 patients aged 19–78 years undergoing an open anterior lumbar interbody 
fusion procedure. Patients had received at least six months of non-operative treatment prior to 
treatment with InductOs for anterior lumbar spine fusion.  Patients were randomised to receive the 
LT-CAGE Lumbar Tapered Fusion Devicea titanium interbody fusion device filled with either 
InductOs or autogenous bone graft taken from the iliac crest. 
At 24 months post-operation, InductOs was demonstrated to be statistically non-inferior to autogenous 
bone graft with a The success rate for radiologically determined fusion wasof 94.4 % for InductOs 
versus 88.9 % for autogenous bone graft (95 % two-sided CI of the difference: -1.53, 12.46) for 
autogenous bone graft. For pain and disability (Oswestry score), the success rate was 72.9 %  in the 
group using InductOs versus 72.5% in the group using autogenous bone graft (95 % two-sided 
CI of the difference: -11.2, 12.0). A single, multi-component endpoint, known as overall success was 
the primary variable of the study. Overall success consists of the following primary efficacy and safety 
considerations: 
•  Radiographically demonstrated fusion 
•  Oswestry pain/disability improvement 
•  Maintenance or improvement in neurological status 
•  No Grade 3 or 4 adverse event classified as implant-associated or implant/surgical 
procedure-associated 
•  No additional surgical procedure performed that was classified as a “failure” 
At 24 months post-operation, the overall success rate was 57.5% for InductOs versus 55.8% (95% 
two-sided CI of the difference: -10.72, 14.01) for autogenous bone graft. 
An additional, non-comparative study of 134 patients who received anterior lumbar interbody fusion 
procedures via a laparoscopic surgical technique yielded similar success rates of  92.9% for fusion, 
85.6% for pain and disability, and 90.3% for neurological status. The study confirmed the applicability 
of anterior lumbar spine fusion using InductOs via laparoscopic surgical implantation techniques. 
A post-hoc meta-analysis of 6 controlled clinical trials with data from patients treated with 
InductOs or autogenous bone graft administered using CE-marked interbody fusion devices 
or allograft bone spacers and various surgical approaches showed that, at 24 months post-
surgery, InductOs was associated with a higher fusion success rate (95 %, 241 out of 255 
patients) compared with autogenous bone graft (85 %, 177 out of 209 patients), with an 
odds ratio of 3.26 (95 % CI: 1.172, 9.075; P = 0.024).  The estimated absolute difference in 
Assessment report

fusion success rate between InductOs and autogenous bone graft was 11.7 % 
(95 % CI: 8.0 %, 22.5 %; P = 0.035). 
In a pooled safety data analysis of 8 clinical trials at 24 months post-surgery, the frequency 
of patients with pseudarthrosis requiring a secondary intervention was approximately 2-fold 
lower following treatment with InductOs (4.8 %, 22 out of 456 patients) compared with 
autogenous bone graft (12.7 %, 31 out of 244 patients).  
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated exposure toxicity and genotoxicity, toxicity to reproduction and 
development.  
In reproductive toxicity studies in rats, where dibotermin alfa was administered intravenously to 
maximize systemic exposure, increased foetal weight and increased fooetal ossification was observed 
and a treatment-related effect could not be ruled out. The clinical relevance of these effects is 
unknown.  
Anti-dibotermin antibodies have been investigated in pregnant rabbits following hyper-immunisation 
with dibotermin alfa to experimentally induce anti-BMP-2dibotermin alfa antibodies. In some foetuses 
with decreased body weights, there were decreases in ossification of frontal and parietal bones (4 out 
of 151 foetuses), which is generally considered to be reversible, and antibody related effects could not 
be ruled out. There were no other alterations in foetal external, visceral, or skeletal morphology. 
Other animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
maternal toxicity, embryolethality, or fetotoxicity. 
InductOs has not been tested for in vivo carcinogenicity. Dibotermin alfa has demonstrated variable 
effects on human tumour cell lines in vitro. Although tThe available in vivotro data on human tumour 
cell lines do not suggest a low potential for promotion of tumour growth or metastasis. As a single 
use product, InductOs has not been tested for in vivo carcinogenicity, the use of InductOs is 
contraindicated in patients with an active malignancy or in patients undergoing treatment for a 
malignancy (see also section 4.3). 
InductOs has been studied in a canine spinal implantation model. InductOs was implanted directly onto 
the exposed dura following a laminectomy. Although narrowing of the neuroforamen and stenosis was 
observed, no mineralization of the dura, no spinal cord stenosis, and no neurological deficits 
subsequent to the application of InductOs were observed. The significance of these data for humans is 
not known. 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have 
been updated. 
Annex II and the Package Leaflet have been updated accordingly. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to: 
•  Update the standard term: Replacement of the term "kit for implant" (rejected on 23 May 2012) by 
the  approved  standard  term  "powder,  solvent  and  matrix"  (approved  on  24  October  2012).  This 
was  requested  by  the  CHMP  during  the  renewal  procedure  and  the  standard  term  is  officially 
approved.  
•  Change in the expression of the strength from 12mg to 1.5 mg/ml. In the "QRD recommendations 
on the expression of strength in the name of centrally authorised human medicinal products", for 
single  use  reconstituted  ‘partial  use’  products  the  strength  should  be  expressed  as  the 
concentration after reconstitution.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
These changes were agreed by the CHMP. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed as the 
impact of the proposed modifications in the Package Information Leaflet readability is considered 
negligible. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In support of the variation, the MAH has presented data from 8 Medtronic-sponsored studies and data 
from literature. Important for this variation is the post-hoc meta-analysis of 6 Medtronic studies and 
literature and a subgroup and meta-regression analysis exploring the potential for differences in fusion 
success rates between InductOs and ICBG due to surgical approach (anterior vs posterior) or by type 
of interbody fusion device. The data set included seven RCTs (including six Medtronic RCTs) and six 
non-randomised controlled studies. 
In the 6 Medtronic-sponsored trials, at 24 months post-surgery, the use of InductOs was associated 
with a higher fusion success rate (94.5%, 241/255) compared with ICBG (84.6%, 177/209).  The 
difference between the two groups was statistically significant (OR 3.262, p=0.024). For the primary 
analysis dataset at 6 and 12 months, the fusion success rate was 96.6% (253/262) and 96.1% 
(249/259) respectively, for InductOs and 92.4% (195/211) and 91.2% (195/212) respectively, for 
ICBG, with no significant difference between the groups at either time point. This does not support a 
claim for accelerated fusion.  
The addition of non-Medtronic RCT (one study) and NRS data (six studies) to the Medtronic CSRs did 
not affect the finding of a significantly increased fusion success rate for rhBMP-2/ACS versus ABG. 
In a subgroup analysis for fusion success by surgical approach for all 6 anterior lumbar interbody 
fusion studies, fusion success was 92.8% (221/238) for InductOs compared with 82.8% (173/209) for 
ICBG (OR 2.29). This compares with 96.8% (274/283) and 91.7% (154/168) for InductOs and ICBG, 
respectively, in all seven posterior studies (OR 2.12). A formal meta-regression analysis found no 
statistically significant difference in the effect of InductOs on fusion success between ALIF and other 
surgical approaches (ratio of odds ratios ROR=0.863, P=0.847). 
In order to increase the number of studies suitable for meta-analysis the MAH widened the inclusion 
criteria. An additional 30 studies were identified by literature search. Most newly added studies were 
retrospective and uncontrolled. In addition the definition of radiological fusion varied widely in the 30 
new studies. For all studies, fusion success rate for rhBMP-2/ACS was 94.0% (95% CI: 91.3-96.3) 
compared to 84.5% (95% CI: 80.7-91.4) for autogenous bone graft. 
Subgroup analysis according to surgical procedure revealed no significant differences in fusion success 
rates for the rhBMP-2/ACS group: ALIF 91.6%, PLIF/TLIF 95.0%, Other 95.0%. In the ABG group 
differences approached statistical significance, with ALIF performing least: ALIF 78.5%, PLIF/TLIF 
91.1%, Other 91.8%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014 
Page 55/60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fusion success rates with rhBMP-2/ACS were not significantly different for interbody device types 
composed of titanium, PEEK, allograft, or other materials (p=0.975), while the difference in fusion 
success between interbody devices in ABG patients was statistically significant (p=0.025).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Initially, the number of studies for subgroup analysis (exploring the potential for differences in fusion 
success rates between InductOs and ICBG due to surgical approach (anterior vs posterior) or by type 
of interbody fusion device) was small, and the statistical power to detect differences between 
subgroups was rather low. In the supplementary meta-analysis provided by the MAH the number of 
studies was increased. This broader range of studies, including uncontrolled studies and studies with a 
small proportion of patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion, led to considerable heterogeneity. 
Even though the same amount of heterogeneity was found earlier in a similar study, suggesting this 
heterogeneity reflects the real use of the product, the results of this supplementary meta-analysis 
were interpreted with caution by the CHMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. The overall frequency of AEs in patients at 24 
months was 80.9% in the pooled InductOs data, compared with 85.7% in the pooled control data. In 
the pooled study data, Back Pain, Pain in Extremity and Fall were the most frequently occurring AEs in 
patients at 24 months. The most notable finding is the frequency of Pseudarthrosis; the rate of the 
event in the InductOs group (6.1%), compared with the control (13.1%). Although Musculoskeletal 
Pain has a frequency of 8.1% in the investigational group and just 4.9% in the control, Muscle Spasm 
has a frequency of 3.5% in the investigational group and 6.6% in control. An imbalance in the rates of 
Retrograde Ejaculation has been noted previously and is unique to the ALIF surgical procedure. 
The Medtronic Clinical trial safety database was pooled by surgical approach, i.e. ALIF and PLIF. In 
general, more patients in the PLIF group experienced AEs as compared to the ALIF group. However, 
there were no differences between rhBMP-2/ACS treated subjects and ABG subjects.  
The System Organ Class (SOC) with the most reported adverse events was Musculoskeletal and 
Connective Tissue Disorders in both groups, with 441 events in 208 subjects for ALIF and 158 events 
in 51 subjects for PLIF. The SOC Nervous System Disorders ranked second with regards to number of 
reported events (ALIF: 115 events in 85 subjects; PLIF: 46 events in 29 subjects). There were no 
important differences between rhBMP-2/ACS treated patients and ABG treated patients. 
Comparison of the other events from the ALIF and PLIF trials shows that the differences predominantly 
reflect the known potential risks of the two specific surgical approaches and that these surgical risks 
are independent of the use of rhBMP-2/ACS. An exception is pseudarthrosis, occurring less frequently 
in rhBMP-2/ACS subjects as compared to controls in both ALIF and PLIF. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The risk for heterotopic ossification is an acknowledged risk with spinal surgery in general and PLIF in 
particular (as described in the RMP). Medtronic clinical trial data show that, as a whole, even with 
increased rates of radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, reoperation rates were not 
increased and overall clinical outcomes were not worse for rhBMP-2-treated patients than control 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/649027/2014

patients. In literature, following surgery with rhBMP-2 in posterior approaches, the risk of symptomatic 
heterotopic ossification (mostly requiring surgery) varies from 0.59% to 6.7%. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Fusion success rate is an important favourable effect. In the eight Medtronic-sponsored studies, only 
11 subjects were treated at a higher lumbar level than L4-S1. The vertebral endplates at L1-L3 and 
L4-S1 are anatomically and histologically similar, and the fusion process is fundamentally the same 
within the intervertebral spaces of the lumbar spine. Therefore, it is reasonable to remove the 
restriction L4-S1 because it seems implausible that the lumbar level alone would affect the 
osteoinductive action of InductOs. 
In most controlled studies overall success was used as primary endpoint, a composite of fusion success 
rate and pain. For the meta-analysis fusion success rate was used, as overall success contains 
elements that are more likely to be affected by aspects of the surgical intervention than the 
pharmacological action of dibotermin alfa. This might be true, but in spinal fusion surgery, the 
pharmacological action of dibotermin alfa cannot be seen separated from the surgical procedure. 
Heterotopic ossification is a significant risk, especially with the posterior approach. This risk is 
described in the RMP. When the spinal canal is involved, spinal stenosis can occur. 
Pseudarthrosis is a risk of spinal surgery. InductOs treated subjects experienced less pseudarthrosis, 
which can be seen as a positive result. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
For successful spinal surgery, a number of factors are important, among which the biological 
environment, patient characteristics, type of surgery. The MAH has submitted a number of studies, but 
most of these are too small to draw conclusions. Therefore, a meta-analysis and subgroup analyses 
were performed.  
As the number of studies was still limited, the MAH widened the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis and 
conducted a supplementary meta-analysis on a total of 43 studies. This broader range of studies, 
including uncontrolled studies and studies with a small proportion of patients undergoing lumbar 
interbody fusion, led to considerable heterogeneity. Therefore, results of this supplementary meta-
analysis have to be interpreted with caution, also taking into account the issue of publication bias. 
The figures indicated that for the rhBMP-2/ACS group surgical approach does not affect fusion success 
rate. In the ABG group differences approached statistical significance, with ALIF performing least: ALIF 
78.5%, PLIF/TLIF 91.1%, Other 91.8%. The MAH reasons that this may be due to the use of 
transpedicular screws in TLIF/PLIF procedures for achieving segmental fixation and as a consequence 
high fusion rates. This seems plausible to the CHMP, as a stable fixation is important for successful 
fusion. However, the added value of rhBMP-2/ACS in procedures other than ALIF can be questioned. 
The difference in fusion success rates in PLIF/TLIF procedures between rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG is only 
4.9%. In the corrected meta-analysis, using only controlled studies, the difference in fusion success 
rates in PLIF/TLIF procedures between rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG was 5.5%. The majority of lumbar 
interbody fusion procedures performed in Europe are performed via posterior approaches (PLIF + TLIF)

and they represented more than 80% of all procedures performed in 2011 compared with ALIF 
representing less than 15% of all procedures. Thus, for Europe, using rhBMP-2/ACS is approved for the 
ALIF-procedure, but this is hardly employed; for the mostly used PLIF-procedure the difference in 
fusing rate between rhBMP-2/ACS and ABG is about 5%.  
The relative effect of InductOs was not significantly associated with the types of interbody device used. 
The effect of surgery and device was analysed for two parameters (fusion success rate and secondary 
surgery). Other parameters were not analysed, and thus influence of surgery and device on these 
parameters is not known. 
Only 11 patients underwent surgery at higher levels than in L4-S1 in the original meta-analysis. In the 
supplementary analysis, 17 studies were included that reported surgery at higher levels. However, the 
number of patients treated at other levels is not known and outcome data were not stratified for 
lumbar level. Thus, no additional data are available for other levels. For fusion biological and 
mechanical environment are important. These do not differ much between L1, L2 and L4-S1. For 
mechanical stability it is required that the osseous component of the end-plate remains intact. 
Difficulties may arise in patients with osteoporosis, for whom there may be a loss of bone density in 
subchondral trabeculae. Overall, factors such as osteoporosis, age, and disease severity may influence 
the nature of the vertebral endplate in contact with rhBMP-2/ACS, but these actors are common to all 
levels of the lumbar spine, with the exception that the frequency of disease severity increases caudally. 
Other anatomical features of the endplate vary more within a single disc level than they do at different 
lumbar levels. Therefore, extension of the indication to levels L1-S1 can be accepted. 
In this application, the safety issues related to surgery, device and spinal level (L1-S1 only) were 
removed from the product information. This was agreed by the CHMP. In general, more patients in the 
PLIF group experienced AEs as compared to the ALIF group. However, there were no differences 
between rhBMP-2/ACS treated subjects and ABG subjects. The risk of heterotopic ossification can be 
adequately minimised by properly informing the HCPs on how to correctly use this device, by taking 
care not to overfill, prevent leakage and create a physical barrier between the device and neurological 
tissue. The update of the SmPC and the MAH’s proposals for risk minimisation are considered adequate 
at the moment. 
It is concluded that the efficacy and safety of the use of InductOs with other types of devices than the 
LT-cage, other types of surgery than the ALIF and higher lumbar level s that L4-S1 is acceptable. 
The benefit-risk balance of InductOs for single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion as a substitute for 
autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least 6 months of 
non-operative treatment for this condition in the treatment of adults is considered positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
 The application for broadening the use in single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion as a substitute 
for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least 6 months of 
non-operative treatment for this condition, is approvable since other concerns  and major objections 
have all been resolved. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following changes:

Type 
II 
Extension of the indication to broaden (anatomically) the use of InductOs in lumbar interbody spine 
fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had 
at least 6 months of non-operative treatment for this condition in the treatment of adults. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Further, SmPC 
section 4.4 has been updated with warnings related to type of surgery, device and spinal level, and 
sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC based on supportive non-clinical and clinical data 
relating to immunogenicity, tumorigenicity or fusion success. The Package Leaflet was updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the standard term has been updated from "kit for implant" to "powder, 
solvent and matrix", and the expression of the strength changed from “12mg” to “1.5 mg/ml” 
throughout the SmPC, labelling and Package leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement the latest QRD template (version 9.0) and to make editorial changes throughout the 
annexes. A revised RMP version 2 was agreed as part of the procedure. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 28 July 2021 an application for a variation 
following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II

approved one 
Extension of indication to include treatment of first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) for Opdivo in 
combination with Yervoy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 24.0 of the Opdivo RMP and version 
33.0 of the Yervoy RMP have also been submitted. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decision(s) 
P/0432/2020, P/0237/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0237/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the WSA did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice on the development of nivolumab in oesophageal cancer from 
the CHMP on 28 May 2020 (EMEA/H/SA/2253/12/2020/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to the 
following clinical aspects:  
Regarding amendments to an ongoing randomized Phase 3 study in adult patients with unresectable 
advanced, recurrent, or metastatic OSCC:  
o  Whether OS as a sole primary endpoint would enable a benefit/risk assessment;  
o  A change in the primary population from PD-L1 expressors to all randomized, for analysis of 
overall survival in the nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab arm.

At that time the MAH was strongly discouraged to amend the analysis plan as proposed/planned, 
bearing in mind that the trial was at a very late stage (i.e. a few months prior to the planned database 
lock). The fact that the study is open label and its pivotal nature were also arguments against the 
proposed late changes that, even if followed from a statistical point of view (e.g. in terms of gain in 
power for the newly proposed primary comparisons), were anticipated to give raise to major issues in 
terms of credibility/integrity of the study at the time of assessment of the corresponding type II 
variation; notwithstanding the Applicant’s claims that all changes were proposed based on external 
data. The MAH followed the scientific advice received and did not implement the changes they 
proposed during this SA.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
24 February 2022 
Oesophageal cancer (OC) is the eighth-most common cancer and the sixth-most common cause of 
death worldwide, with an estimated 604,100 new cases (3.1% of all cancers) and 544,076 cancer 
deaths (5.5% of all cancer deaths) (GLOBOCAN 2020). In the UE, oesophageal cancer is the 19th most 
common cancer (1.2% of all new cancers), although variability between countries is high and may 
Assessment report

reflect different prevalence of risk factors, use of screening and diagnostic methods. Around 53,000 
new cases of OC were registered in Europe in 2020. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Proposed Indication 
The MAH initially applied for the following indication: 
OPDIVO, in combination with ipilimumab, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (see section 
5.1). 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (see 
section 5.1). 
During the procedure the indication was amended. The agreed indication is as follows: 
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. 
Dosage and administration 
The recommended dose is either 3 mg/kg nivolumab every 2 weeks or 360 mg nivolumab every 3 
weeks administered intravenously over 30 minutes in combination with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab 
administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 6 weeks. Treatment is recommended until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The two distinct histologic types of OC are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) 
(Abnet CC 2018). Globally, OSCC remains the predominant histological subtype (approximately 90% of 
total cases but around 65% in most European countries) (Wong MCS, 2018); however, the incidence 
of OSCC has been decreasing, while the incidence of OAC has been increasing rapidly, particularly in 
Western Europe, North America, and Australia.  SCC continues to be the more common OC in Asia. 
Mortality rates associated with AC are rising and have surpassed those of SCC in several regions in the 
EU. 
Oesophageal carcinoma is rare in young people and increases in incidence with age, peaking in the 
seventh and eighth decades of life. AC is three to four times as common in men as it is in women, 
whereas the sex distribution is more equal for SCC. 
The main risk factors for OSCC in Western countries are smoking and alcohol consumption, whereas 
OAC predominantly occurs in patients with chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and their risk is 
correlated with the patient’s body mass index with a higher risk for obese people. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Alcohol consumption, smoking and poor socioeconomical status represent major risk factors for OSCC. 
Differences in exposure to well established common risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol, genetic 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 9/168 
 
 
 
polymorphism in alcohol metabolism genes, and different levels of exposure to suspected risk factors, 
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, may contribute to the observed regional differences in OSCC 
incidence. 
The molecular biology of OSCC is not yet fully understood. Of note, comprehensive molecular analyses 
of OC by The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) have shown that OSCC is molecularly distinct 
from OAC (Kim J. 2017).  Based on these analyses, OSCC has stronger resemblance to other 
squamous tumours like SCCHN than to OAC, and consequently, OAC resembles gastric cancer more 
than OSCC. Squamous cell carcinomas are different from adenocarcinoma in genetic alterations, gene 
expression and DNA methylation profiles. Frequent alterations in cell cycle regulators, RTK/RAS/PI(3)K 
pathways and chromatin-modifying enzymes have been observed in OSCC and the patterns were 
different from those of OAC. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
All patients with new dysphagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent aspiration or emesis, weight loss 
and/or loss of appetite should undergo an upper intestinal endoscopy. Approximately three-quarters of 
all ACs are found in the distal oesophagus, whereas SCCs occur more frequently in the proximal to 
middle oesophagus. The differentiation between SCC and AC is of prognostic and clinical relevance. 
Immunohistochemical stainings are recommended in poorly and undifferentiated cancers (G 3/4) 
according to WHO to differentiate between SCC and AC. 
Approximately 50% of OCs will be locally or locoregionally advanced at diagnosis, and thus amenable 
to potentially curative loco-regional therapy. Five-year survival rates for all patients with OC have 
shown modest improvements over the past 35 years, from 5% in 1975 to approximately 20% for 
patients diagnosed in 2004.  Five-year survival rates for loco-regionally advanced disease treated with 
surgery alone have been consistently poor, ranging from 6% to 26%. 
Management 
The management of OC often requires a multi-disciplinary approach, with treatment decisions involving 
surgical, radiation, and medical oncology expertise. Recommendations by treatment guidelines for OC 
are based on histology (i.e., SCC vs. AC). Patients with advanced or metastatic OSCC are generally 
treated with palliative intent with chemotherapy to extend survival, and with localized treatments, such 
as radiotherapy (including external radiation or brachytherapy), or endoscopic therapies, such as 
stents, for the symptomatic treatment of obstruction and dysphagia. Chemotherapy is typically offered 
to selected patients with good performance status, although its value is less proved than in AC, 
according to ESMO clinical practice guidelines (2016). 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained the mainstay treatment for advanced OSCC for many years. In 
the first-line (1L) setting, combination chemotherapies are routinely used. Although there are some 
differences, global guidelines are generally consistent and recommend the combination of a 
fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] or capecitabine) with a platinum agent (cisplatin or oxaliplatin). 
The combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil is the only chemotherapy option which is supported by 
data from a randomized Phase 2 trial in OSCC. In that trial which was conducted in Europe, patients 
(n=88) with locally advanced or metastatic OSCC were treated with cisplatin 100 mg/m2, combined 
with 5-FU at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion from days 1-5 or with cisplatin alone. 
Cisplatin in combination with 5-FU (vs cisplatin alone) conferred a response rate of 35% (95% CI: 20, 
54%) vs 19% (95% CI: 8, 35%) and median survival of 7.6 vs 6.4 months. Cisplatin may be 
substituted in clinical practice by oxaliplatin because of a more favourable safety profile and 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 10/168 
 
 
 
fluorouracil may be substituted by alternative fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine. This is 
encouraged by international treatment guidelines such as NCCN. 
Recent findings from the KEYNOTE 590 study (median follow-up 10.8 months) showed that immune 
checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the 1L setting was superior 
to chemotherapy for OS and PFS in patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic EAC, 
OSCC (73% of the study population), or Siewert type 1 GEJ adenocarcinoma.  In the overall KEYNOTE-
590 population, median OS was 12.4 months (95% CI: 10.5, 14.0) vs 9.8 months (95% CI: 8.8, 10.8) 
with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy (HR=0.73 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.86]) and 
median PFS was 6.3 months (95% CI: 6.2, 6.9) vs 5.8 months (95% CI: 5.0, 6.0), respectively 
(HR=0.65 [95% CI: 0.55, 0.76]). Based on these study findings, pembrolizumab (in combination with 
platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy) received an European Commission decision in 
June 2021 for the 1L treatment of locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal carcinoma (including 
OSCC) that is not amenable to surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation in patients whose 
tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS≥10 (Keytruda II/97). 
Unmet Medical Need 
OSCC is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis; the global 5-year relative survival rate is < 20%.  
For decades, platinum plus fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy was the only recommended 1L 
treatment for advanced or metastatic OSCC, resulting in poor survival (median OS <1 year). Despite 
the recent approval of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for 1L treatment of OSCC, there are still 
opportunities to advance new modalities and regimens that improve survival in this setting. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction 
with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Tumours use PD-L1 expression as a defense or escape mechanism 
against the host’s anti-tumour T-cell response; inhibiting PD-(L)1 restores the function of these anti-
tumor T-cells which have become ineffective or suppressed. Therefore, the efficacy of PD-(L)1 
inhibition relies on a pre-existing immune response. Nivolumab, as monotherapy, is approved for 
multiple indications, including for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent OSCC who 
received prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy in the EU. 
Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets CTLA-4. CTLA-4 inhibition can induce de novo 
T-cell responses and recruit novel/additional T cells to the tumour. 
In the EU, nivolumab as monotherapy has been approved for the treatment of melanoma, non-small 
cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck, urothelial carcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adjuvant treatment of 
OC or GEJC. The combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab (Yervoy) has been approved for the 
treatment of melanoma, RCC, malignant pleural mesothelioma and dMMR or MSI-H colorectal cancer, 
and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC. The combination of nivolumab with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination 
chemotherapy has been approved for the treatment of first-line HER-2 negative gastric, GEJ or 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma whose tumours express PD-L1 with CPS ≥ 5%, and the combination of 
nivolumab with cabozantinib has been approved for the first-line treatment of RCC. Ipilimumab, as 
monotherapy, is approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Study CA209648, a Phase 3, open-label, randomized trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab 
combined with fluorouracil plus cisplatin versus fluorouracil plus cisplatin in subjects with unresectable 
advanced, recurrent or metastatic previously untreated oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the 
pivotal study for the current application (see section 4.4.2. Main study).  
The MAH did seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP on the design of study CA209648, the pivotal trial for 
this application (EMEA/H/SA/2253/12/2020/II). Questions referred to the choice of endpoints and 
primary population (see section 1). The MAH overall followed the recommendations of the CHMP 
scientific advice. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Both nivolumab and ipilimumab are proteins composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are expected 
to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk. As a protein, nivolumab and ipilimumab 
are exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment under the 1 June 2006 “Guideline 
on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/S/4447/00). Nivolumab, ipilimumab and the product excipients do not pose a significant 
risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

The clinical pharmacology document summarizes the human pharmacokinetics (PK), exposure-
response (E-R), and immunogenicity data of nivolumab (OPDIVO®, BMS-936558, MDX-1106, ONO-
4538) in support of the efficacious and safe use of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the 
first-line (1L) treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The purpose of the pharmacometric analyses described in this document is to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab (BMS-936558, MDX-1106, ONO-4538) when administered in 
combination with ipilimumab (BMS-734016) or fluorouracil plus cisplatin and to characterize the PK of 
ipilimumab when administered in combination with nivolumab as the first-line (1L) treatment in 
subjects with unresectable advanced, recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(OSCC) based on the data from Phase 3 Study CA209648. 
Study CA209648 was a randomized, global Phase 3 study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab (nivo+ipi 
hereafter) or nivolumab in combination with fluorouracil plus cisplatin (nivo+chemo hereafter) versus 
fluorouracil and cisplatin chemotherapy (chemo hereafter) as 1L-therapy in unresectable advanced, 
recurrent, or metastatic OSCC. The clinical database lock occurred on 01-Mar-2021 and included data 
for subjects randomized to the nivo+ipi, nivo+chemo and chemo arms.  
The treatment used in this study was nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute infusion every 2 weeks

Final model of Nivolumab 
The final model for nivolumab was developed from the full model by performing a stepwise backward 
elimination of the covariate effects of the full model (co-administration with chemotherapy or 
ipilimumab and subject population on CL, and subject population and PS on Emax) to determine a 
parsimonious model. Parameter estimates of the final model following backward elimination are 
presented in Table 5.1.1.3-1. The condition number of the final model was 309, indicating there was 
no evidence for ill-conditioning.

The final model was described as 2-compartment model, with zero-order IV infusion and time-varying 
CL (sigmoidal-Emax function), with a proportional residual error model. Random effects were 
estimated for CL, VC, and Emax, including the covariance between CL and VC. The covariate effects of 
BBWT on Q and VP were constrained to be the same as the effects of BBWT on CL and VC, 
respectively. 
The final model estimated (typical value) Emax (-0.387) indicates that nivolumab CL decreases with 
time, and that the maximal decrease is approximately 32.1% [calculated as: 1 −exp(Emax)]. The 
typical half-maximal change is estimated to occur at approximately 2 months (T50 = 1,400 hours).

Ipilimumab 
Final Ipilimumab model 
The final model for ipilimumab was developed from the full model by performing a stepwise backward 
elimination of the covariate effects of the full model (subject population on CL) to determine a 
parsimonious model. The final model estimated (typical value) Emax (-0.238) indicates that 
ipilimumab CL decreases with time, and that the maximal decrease is approximately 21% [calculated 
as: 1 −exp(Emax)]. The half-maximal change is estimated to occur at approximately 3.4 months (T50 
= 2,480 hours) in all subjects.

Special populations 
Baseline Body weight on Nivolumab exposure 
As presented, nivolumab CL increased approximately 20% with an increase in BBWT from the median 
to 95th percentile value. The VC was higher with higher BBWT (approximately 28%, between the 
median and 95th percentile values for BBWT). The impact of this effect on nivolumab exposure was 
evaluated in subjects with 1L OSCC.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively 
binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) membrane receptor. The PD-1 is a negative regulatory 
molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed 
death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. 
Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-
specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens and self-antigens. 
Ipilimumab is a soluble, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG1κ) that selectively binds to the 
cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4; CD152) expressed on a subset of T-cells, thereby 
blocking the interaction between CTLA-4 and B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and 
preventing the inhibitory modulation of T-cell activation promoted by such interaction. Ipilimumab 
monotherapy is currently approved in the US, EU, and several other countries for the treatment of 
metastatic melanoma and the adjuvant treatment of melanoma and is being investigated across tumor 
types in combination with other modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other 
immunotherapies. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-efficacy 
E-R Analysis of Efficacy for OS - Nivo+Ipi - Overall Study Population: For the E-R OS model of 
nivo+ipi vs chemo, both linear and log-linear functional forms of nivolumab and ipilimumab CavgW6 
were assessed in the full model for the overall study population. Due to a high correlation (r > 0.97) 
between nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures, ipilimumab CavgW6 was removed from the full model. 
Ipilimumab treatment was tested and still resulted in a high correlation with nivolumab exposure and 
was removed from the model. Among the evaluated functional forms of exposure effect, the linear 
function of nivolumab CavgW6 had the lowest BIC value but did not meet the criteria of a reduction in 
BIC of at least 2. Therefore, log-linear nivolumab CavgW6 was selected for the full model 
development. 
The interaction between nivolumab CavgW6 and sex and nivolumab CavgW6 and age reduced BIC by 5 
and 0.4, respectively. However, the interaction between nivolumab CavgW6 and age was not included 
in the model due to high correlations. No other significant covariates resulted in an interaction effect 
with nivolumab CavgW6 that decreased the BIC. Thus, the full model included only the interaction 
between nivolumab CavgW6 and sex. Figure 3 is a graphical presentation of the estimated effects in 
the full OS model for nivo+ipi in the overall study population, showing the HRs of OS across the 
predictor ranges and the associated 95% CIs, relative to the median value (for continuous covariates 
except CavgW6) or reference group (for categorical covariates). The effect of nivolumab CavgW6 on 
HR of OS was calculated relative to the chemo-only arm. 
In the full model assessment, the relationship between nivolumab CavgW6 with OS was dependent on 
whether subjects with 1L OSCC were male or female. Males had a slightly lower OS HR than females at 
the same nivolumab CavgW6. In male subjects, nivolumab CavgW6 exposures were associated with 
significantly (95% CI interval excluded 1) lower risk of death than the chemo alone (HR of 0.62 [95% 
CI: 0.5, 0.76] over chemo [CavgW6 = 0] at the 5th percentile of CavgW6 [CavgW6 = 24 μg/mL], and 
HR of 0.6 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.75] over chemo at the 95th percentile of CavgW6 [CavgW6 = 48 μg/mL]). 
In female subjects, nivolumab CavgW6 exposures were associated with lower risk of death than the 
chemo alone (HR of 0.828 [95% CI: 0.665, 1.03] over chemo [CavgW6 = 0] at the 5th percentile of 
Assessment report

Page 44/168 
 
 
 
CavgW6 [CavgW6 = 24 μg/mL], and HR of 0.854 [95% CI: 0.668, 1.09] over chemo at the 95th 
percentile of CavgW6 [CavgW6 = 48 μg/mL]). The E-R relationship was relatively flat across the range 
of nivolumab CavgW6 in this study as evidenced by the limited range of HRs associated with the 5th 
and 95th percentiles of nivolumab CavgW6. 
The categorical variables that were identified as significant predictors (95% CI of effect did not include 
1) on OS in the full model were race and PS. The risk of death increased with PS (= 1) and decreased 
with Asian race.  
The continuous variables identified as significant predictors (95% CI of effect did not include 1) on OS 
in the full model were nivolumab CavgW6, age, baseline weight, baseline tumour size, and baseline 
ALB. The risk of death increased with higher baseline tumour size (HR of 1.38 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.74] for 
95th percentile of baseline tumour size relative to the median), lower baseline weight (HR of 1.34 
[95% CI: 1.13, 1.58] for 5th percentile of weight relative to the median weight), younger age (HR of 
1.35 [95% CI: 1.12, 1.62] for 5th percentile of age relative to the median age), and lower baseline 
ALB (HR of 1.85 [95% CI: 1.49, 2.3] for 5th percentile of ALB relative to the median baseline ALB). 
The 95% CI of the HRs for all the other predictor variables evaluated (eg, sex, tumor PD-L1 1% status, 
number of organs with metastases at baseline, disease status, smoking status, and alcohol use) 
included 1, indicating that these factors did not have statistically significant effects on OS. The VPC 
plots indicate the model-predicted median (90% PI) was in good agreement with the observed KM of 
OS, indicating adequate model performance. Model-predicted cumulative probabilities of OS using 
predicted CavgW6 for the nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W+ipi and nivo 360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W)+ipi as well as 
the chemo-only arm in Study CA209648 are presented in Figure 4. Both nivolumab-treated regimens 
showed improved OS compared to the chemo-only group.

E-R Analysis of Efficacy for OS - Nivo+Ipi - Tumor Cell PD-L1 Expression ≥ 1% Population: 
For the E-R OS model of nivo+ipi vs chemo, both linear and log-linear functional forms of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab CavgW6 were assessed in the full model for the tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% 
population. Due to a high correlation (r > 0.97) between nivolumab and ipilimumab exposures, 
ipilimumab CavgW6 was removed from the full model. Ipilimumab treatment was tested and still 
resulted in a high correlation with nivolumab exposure and was removed from the model. Among the 
evaluated functional forms of exposure effect, the linear function of nivolumab CavgW6 had the lowest 
BIC value but did not meet the criteria of a reduction in BIC of at least 2. Therefore, the log-linear 
effect of nivolumab CavgW6 was selected for inclusion in the full model. No significant covariates 
resulted in an interaction effect with nivolumab CavgW6 that decreased the BIC. 
The categorical variables that were identified as significant predictors (95% CI of effect did not include 
1) on OS in the full model were race and sex. The risk of death decreased with female sex and with 
Asian race.

The continuous variables that were identified as significant predictors (95% CI of effect did not include 
1) on OS in the full model were nivolumab CavgW6, baseline weight, and baseline ALB. Higher 
nivolumab CavgW6 exposures were associated with significantly (95% CI interval excluded 1) lower 
risk of death than the chemo alone (HR of 0.56 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.74] over chemo [CavgW6 = 0] at the 
5th percentile of CavgW6 [CavgW6 = 24 μg/mL], and HR of 0.54 [95% CI: 0.4, 0.73] over chemo at 
the 95th percentile of CavgW6 [CavgW6 = 48 μg/mL]). The risk of death increased with lower baseline 
weight (HR of 1.34 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.71] for 5th percentile of weight relative to the median weight) 
and lower baseline ALB (HR of 1.82 [95% CI: 1.39, 2.39] for 5th percentile of ALB relative to the 
median baseline ALB). 
The 95% CI of the HRs for all the other predictor variables evaluated (eg, age, baseline tumor size, PS, 
number of organs with metastases at baseline, disease status, smoking status, and alcohol use) 
included 1, indicating that these factors did not have statistically significant effects on OS. The VPC 
plots indicate the model-predicted median (90% PI) was in good agreement with the observed KM of 
OS, indicating adequate model performance. 
Exposure-safety 
E-R Analysis of Safety for Gr2+ IMAEs: For the E-R safety model, both linear and log-linear 
functional forms of daily exposure of nivolumab and ipilimumab were assessed for their effect on the 
risk of Gr2+ IMAEs in the full model. Among the evaluated functional forms of exposure effect, the log-
linear function of nivolumab daily Cavg and ipilimumab daily Cavg had the lowest BIC value and was 
selected as the full model. An ipilimumab treatment effect was tested instead of the log-linear 
ipilimumab daily Cavg, but it did not lower the BIC by 2 points and therefore was not included in the 
Gr2+ IMAE full model. No interactions between nivolumab or ipilimumab daily Cavg and covariates 
were significant predictors of Gr2+ IMAEs that reduced the BIC, and therefore none were included in 
the full model.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK model 
The Applicant has conducted a model-based approach by implementing the previously developed 
population PK models of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with oesophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC). The modelling strategy is endorsed and the data analysis, exploratory assessment 
and data handling seems appropriate.  
The population PK model of nivolumab is able to characterize the time-course profile based on the 
pcVPC and GOF plots of nivolumab in OSCC patients. The statistically significant covariate relationships 
were included and allowed to partially reduce the inter-individual variability.  
The clinical impact of significant covariates on nivolumab exposure has been conducted, suggesting no 
clinically relevant changes in nivolumab exposure due to body weight, and clinically relevant 
differences on Cmin,ss and Cavg,ss in patients with very low (5th percentile) baseline albumin levels, 
which could partially explain the differences in the exposure-efficacy relationship.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022

The population PK model of ipilimumab is able to characterize the time-course profile based on the 
pcVPC and GOF plots of ipilimumab in OSCC patients. The statistically significant covariate 
relationships were included and allowed to partially reduce the inter-individual variability.  
No clinically relevant changes in ipilimumab exposure were predicted among the covariates tested in 
OSCC patients, suggesting that there is no need for ipilimumab dose adjustment in special sub-groups 
of populations.  
Dosing regimens 
The evaluation of alternative dosing schedules of nivolumab (3 mg/kg Q2W vs. 240 mg Q2W and 3 
mg/kg Q2W vs. 360 mg Q3W) in combination with ipilimumab through a model-based approach is 
appreciated, but should be considered based on the impact in terms of efficacy or safety endpoints, 
which is unclear especially in patients with extreme baseline body-weight and baseline albumin levels. 
A clinically relevant increase in exposure at steady-state conditions has been predicted when 240 mg 
Q2W (37.3% on Cmax,ss, 38% on Cmin,ss, and 38% Cave,ss) and 360 mg Q3W (62.7% on Cmax,ss, 
22.3% on Cmin,ss, and 38% Cave,ss). 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
The evaluation of the exposure-efficacy on OS and PFS endpoints using the overall study population 
and the stratified group of tumour cell PD-L1 expression population revealed the improved efficacy 
when nivolumab+ipilimumab vs. chemo alone arms are selected. The recommendation of nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab seems to be justified in the overall population and tumour cell PD-L1 
expression ≥1% population based on the OS and PFS in adult patients with unresectable advanced, 
recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, although the predicted probability for 
OS is only slightly improved in the nivo+ipi arm vs. chemotherapy. 
Exposure-safety 
The exposure-safety evaluation revealed a higher probability of Grade2+ IMAE (50-60%) when 
nivolumab is co-administered with ipilimumab vs. the chemo group, suggesting a clear higher 
incidence when ipilimumab is selected vs. chemotherapy. A similar benefit/risk assessment was 
predicted when a flat dosing regimen (360 mg Q3W) of nivolumab was compared with a body weight 
regimen of 3 mg/kg Q2W of nivolumab.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of nivolumab+ipilimumab groups were evaluated through the 
implementation of a previously developed population PK model of nivolumab and ipilimumab, which 
has been adapted to patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The pharmacokinetic 
characterization seems appropriate based on the evidence provided. The exposure-efficacy and 
exposure-safety analyses demonstrated the adequacy of the exposure metrics selected to predict the 
OS/PFS and the incidence of Grade2+ IMAE across the different sub-groups of patients.

2.4.2.  Main study 
Study CA209648: A randomized Phase 3 study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab 
combined with fluorouracil plus cisplatin versus fluorouracil plus cisplatin in subjects with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic previously untreated oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma. 
Methods 
Figure 1. CA209648 Study Design Schematic 
This study will consist of 3 phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. Subjects will be evaluated for 
disease progression every 6 weeks from the date of first dose (± 7 days) up to and including Week 48, 
and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter, regardless of treatment schedule, until disease 
progression or the subject discontinues the study, whichever comes first. 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria 
Subjects were required to be ≥ 18 years of age and have histologically confirmed squamous cell 
carcinoma or adenosquamous cell carcinoma (predominant squamous differentiation) of the 
oesophagus that was classified as unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic (per AJCC 7th 
edition). Disease must not have been amenable to curative approaches such as definitive 
chemoradiation and/or surgery, and no prior systemic anticancer therapy was allowed as primary 
therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or definitive, chemotherapy/ 
radiotherapy/ chemoradiotherapy for OSCC was permitted if given as part of curative intent regimen 
and completed before enrolment. A minimum 24-week recurrence-free period was required after 
completion of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapies or after completion of multimodal therapies for 
locally advanced disease. 
In addition, all subjects were required to have: 
−  Baseline ECOG PS of ≤ 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 52/168 
 
 
 
 
−  A least one measurable lesion by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) per RECIST 1.1 criteria performed within 28 days prior to randomization. 
−  PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, with evaluable results, performed by the central 
lab during the Screening period. Either 1 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour 
tissue block or 15 unstained tumour tissue slides, with an associated pathology report if 
available, were to be submitted for biomarker evaluation prior to study drug administration. 
− 
In order to be randomized, subjects were required to have an evaluable tumour cell PD-L1 
expression classification (≥ 1%, < 1%, or indeterminate) as determined by the central lab. 
Subjects with non-evaluable results will not be allowed to be randomized. 
Key exclusion criteria 
−  Subjects must have recovered from the effects of major surgery or significant traumatic injury 
at least 14 days before randomization. 
−  Prior malignancy requiring active treatment within the previous 3 years except for locally 
curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, 
superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast. 
−  Patients with any metastasis in the brain or meninx that is symptomatic or requires treatment. 
Patients may be randomized if the metastasis is asymptomatic and requires no treatment. 
−  Patients at high risks of bleeding or fistula due to apparent invasion of tumour to organs (the 
aorta or the trachea) adjacent to oesophageal lesions. 
−  Subjects with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with Type I diabetes 
mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only requiring hormone 
replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic 
treatment are permitted to enroll. 
−  Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 
−  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of start 
of study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 
mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. 
−  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 
antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or 
checkpoint pathways. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomized to one of the following open label treatments (Arms A, B, and C): 
•  Arm A (nivo + ipi): nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) intravenously (IV) + ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W) IV. 
•  Arm B (nivo + chemo): nivolumab 240 mg Q2W IV + fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day IV on Day 1 
through Day 5 + cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of a 4-week cycle. 
•  Arm C (chemo): fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day IV Day 1 through Day 5 + cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV 
on Day 1 of a 4-week cycle.

Treatment with nivolumab or nivolumab with ipilimumab was to be given for up to 24 months in the 
absence of disease progression (unless treatment beyond progression was permitted) or unacceptable 
toxicity. No dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab and ipilimumab were allowed. Doses of 
nivolumab and/or ipilimumab could be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how well the 
subject tolerated the treatment. If a subject met the criteria for discontinuation of nivolumab but not 
for ipilimumab, both nivolumab and ipilimumab were to be discontinued. If discontinuation criteria 
were met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab might be continued if 
ipilimumab was discontinued. 
Treatment beyond initial, investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1-defined progression was permitted in the 
nivo + ipi or nivo + chemo arms if the subject had investigator-assessed clinical benefit and was 
tolerating treatment. 
Fluorouracil + cisplatin chemotherapy was given as per the study dosing schedule until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Doses of fluorouracil and/or cisplatin could be interrupted, 
delayed, reduced, or discontinued depending on how well the subject tolerated the treatment. 
Note that country-specific CA209648 Protocol Amendment 10 (27-Sep-2018) allowed for a 4-day 
continuous infusion of 1000 mg/m2 fluorouracil as an alternative to a 5-day continuous infusion for 
subjects in Korea and Taiwan in the nivo +chemo arm or chemo arm. The total dose of fluorouracil per 
cycle remained 4000 mg/m2.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Primary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with PD-L1 
expressing tumours. 
OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For subjects 
without documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be 
alive. 
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented PD per BICR or 
death due to any cause. Subjects who die without a reported prior PD per BICR (and die without start 
of subsequent therapy) will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. Subjects who did 
not have documented PD per BICR per RECIST1.1 criteria and who did not die, will be censored at the 
date of the last evaluable tumour assessment on or prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy. Subjects who did not have any on-study tumour assessments and did not die (or died after 
initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy) will be censored at the randomization date. Subjects 
who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported PD per BICR will be censored 
at the last tumour assessment on or prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. 
Secondary endpoints 
­  OS in All Randomized subjects.  
­  PFS (as assessed by BICR) in All Randomized subjects.  
­  Objective Response Rate (ORR) (as assessed by BICR) in subjects with PD-L1 expressing 
tumours and All Randomized subjects.  
It is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR divided by 
the number of randomized subjects in the population for each treatment group. BOR is defined as 
the best response designation as determined by BICR, recorded between the date of randomization 
and the date of objectively documented progression (per RECIST 1.1 as determined by BICR) or 
the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy (including tumour-directed radiotherapy and tumour-
directed surgery), whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression or 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR 
determination. 
Exploratory endpoints 
­  PFS (as assessed by investigator) in subjects with PD-L1 expressing tumours and All 
Randomized subjects.  
­  ORR (as assessed by investigator) in subjects with PD-L1 expressing tumours and All 
Randomized subjects. 
­  Duration of Response (DOR) (as assessed by BICR and as assessed by investigator) is defined 
as the time between the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of the first 
disease progression, per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  
­  PFS2/TSST in subjects with PD-L1 expressing tumours and all randomized subjects. PFS2/TSST 
is defined as the time from randomization to the date of investigator-defined documented 
second objective disease progression or start of second subsequent therapy or death due to 
any cause, whichever comes first.

Sample size 
Sample size calculations assumed that the prevalence of subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression 
≥ 1% was approximately 50%, and the proportion of subjects with (≥ 1%) or without (< 1% or 
indeterminate) PD-L1 tumour expression was monitored during enrolment. 
The study sample size was based on the primary objectives, i.e., on the comparisons of the PFS/OS 
distributions of subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% between those who were randomized 
to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and those randomized to receive chemotherapy, and between 
those who were randomized to receive nivolumab plus chemotherapy and those randomized to receive 
chemotherapy. For both experimental arms, the same OS distributions and the same PFS distributions 
were assumed. A piecewise mixture cure rate model was used for the design setup, with cure rates in 
the experimental arms of 15% for OS in tumour cell PD-L1 ≥ 1%, 10% for OS in tumour cell PD-L1 < 
1%, and 0% for PFS per BICR. As a result, for each of the nivo + ipi (Arm A) vs. chemo (Arm C) and 
nivo + chemo (Arm B) vs. chemo (Arm C) comparisons: 
•  250 PFS events in approximately 313 subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% would 
provide approximately 90% power to detect an average hazard ratio (HR) of 0.62 with a Type I 
error of 1.5% (two-sided); 
•  250 OS events in approximately 313 subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% would 
provide approximately 90% power to detect an average HR of 0.6 with a Type I error of 1% 
(two-sided). 
In case the significance level from the corresponding primary endpoint in subjects with tumour cell PD-
L1 expression ≥ 1% was passed to the secondary endpoint in all randomized subjects: 
•  512 PFS events in approximately 626 subjects (all comers) would provide approximately 90% 
power to detect an average HR of 0.72 with a Type I error of 1.5% (two-sided); 
•  514 OS events in approximately 626 subjects (all comers) would provide approximately 94% 
power to detect an average HR of 0.68 with a Type I error of 1% (two-sided). 
To have approximately 313 randomized subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% for each 
comparison, approximately 470 subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% needed to be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in the 3 arms. This translated to a total of approximately 939 subjects 
(with any PD-L1 result) to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the nivo + ipi (Arm A) or nivo + chemo 
(Arm B) or chemo (Arm C) arms. Assuming a piecewise constant accrual rate, it was estimated that 
these 939 subjects would be accrued within 29 months. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the treatments. At randomization, patients 
were stratified according to the following stratification factors: 
­  Tumour cell PD-L1 status: ≥ 1% vs. < 1% (including indeterminate)* 
­  Region: East Asia (Japan, Korea, Taiwan) vs. Rest of Asia (China, Hong Kong, Singapore) vs. 
Rest of World (RoW) 
­  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (0 vs. 1) 
­  Number of organs with metastases (≤ 1 vs. ≥ 2)

*The proportions of subjects with or without tumour cell PD-L1 expression were monitored and 
reassessed as needed to ensure that the sample size of randomized subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1% was adequate for analysis (i.e. approximately 50% of all randomized). 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable as the trial was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Populations for analyses 
The following definitions of populations will be applicable for subjects whose tumours express PD-L1 
and also for subjects regardless of PD-L1 expression. 
−  All Enrolled Subjects: All subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered into 
the IRT 
−  All Randomized Subjects: All enrolled subjects who were randomized to any treatment arm in the 
study 
−  All Treated Subjects: All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug during 
the study 
−  PK Subjects: All randomized subjects with available serum time-concentration data. 
−  Outcome Research subjects: All randomized subjects who have an assessment at 
screening/baseline and at least 1 follow-up assessment 
− 
Immunogenicity subjects: All randomized subjects who have an assessment at screening/baseline 
and at least 1 follow-up assessment 
−  Biomarker subjects: All randomized subjects with available biomarker data. 
Protection of Type I error  
Family-wise Type I error will be protected in the strong sense across all primary and secondary 
endpoints. The p-values from sensitivity analyses for efficacy endpoints are for descriptive purpose 
only and not adjusted for multiplicity. 
The  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were  tested  using  the  Bonferroni-based  graphical  approach  by 
Maurer and Bretz (2013). Figure below presents a graphical display of the multiple testing procedure.

Figure 2. Graphical Representation of the Testing Strategy for the Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
The planned test procedure was identical for the nivo + ipi (Arm A) vs. chemo (Arm C) and for the nivo 
+ chemo (Arm B) vs. chemo (Arm C) comparisons and was conducted as follows. 
At the time of the PFS final analysis, all 4 primary endpoints were tested, with the following initially 
allocated (endpoint-specific) 2-sided alpha levels: 
­  PFS in subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%: 0.015 (2-sided) 
­  OS in subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%: the overall initially allocated 
(endpoint-specific) alpha of 0.01 (2 sided) would be distributed over the IA and FA based on 
the actual number of deaths for each comparison at OS IA, using Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. 
Alpha levels in this study are 2-sided. Upon availability of study data after database lock, the statistical 
testing procedure proceeded as follows. 
Nivo + ipi vs. chemo:  
­  For PFS: since the primary endpoint of PFS in all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1% was not significant at the 2-sided alpha level 0.015 (p-value: 0.8958), then 
the PFS and ORR secondary endpoints were not formally tested and no alpha was passed to 
the PFS/ORR secondary endpoints and OS primary endpoint from the secondary endpoint of 
PFS in all randomized subjects.  
­  For OS: the observed number of OS events in all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1% at IA was 227 [90.8% of the target final number of 250 OS events]. With the 
total overall alpha of 0.02 (initial allocated overall alpha of 0.01 plus 0.01 alpha passed from 
the secondary OS endpoint in all randomized subjects for nivo + chemo vs. chemo), the 
Assessment report

Page 58/168 
 
 
 
 
significance level was 0.014 for OS IA in all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1%. Since the primary endpoint of OS was significant at the IA 2-sided alpha level 
0.014 (p-value: 0.0010), then the secondary endpoint of OS in all randomized subjects was 
tested with the overall 2-sided alpha level 0.02. The observed number of OS events in all 
randomized subjects at IA was 448 [87.2% of the target final number of 514 OS events]. With 
the overall alpha of 0.02, the significance level was 0.018 for OS IA in all randomized subjects. 
The secondary endpoint of OS was significant at the IA 2-sided alpha level of 0.018 (p-value: 
0.0110). Per testing procedure, the alpha can only be passed in one direction between 2 
comparisons, therefore the alpha of 0.02 for OS in nivo + ipi vs. chemo cannot be passed back 
to OS in nivo + chemo vs chemo. 
Analysis of primary endpoints 
OS and PFS as assessed by BICR in all subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% were planned 
to be compared between nivo + ipi (Arm A) and chemo (Arm C), and between nivo + chemo (Arm B) 
and chemo (Arm C) using a two-sided log-rank test, stratified by the following stratification factors: 
ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) and number of organs with metastases (≤ 1 vs. ≥ 2). Though the 
study randomization was stratified by region (East Asia vs. Rest of Asia vs. RoW), region was excluded 
from all stratified analyses due to small sample size in Rest of Asia.  
For each comparison, the HR of PFS and OS with its associated two-sided 100(1-α)% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were estimated via a stratified Cox model with treatment arm as the only covariate in 
the model. 
Median OS and PFS for each treatment arm were estimated and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
product-limit method. Median OS and PFS along with 95% CIs were constructed based on a log-log 
transformed CI for the survival function. 
Per Revised Protocol 05, final PFS analysis could have had either an event-based trigger (ie, conducted 
when 136 events were observed among the subjects with tumour cellPD-L1 expression ≥ 1% in the 
chemo arm) or a time-based trigger (i.e., conducted when at least 12 months of minimum follow-up 
was reached). The trigger for the final PFS analysis based on the 01-Mar-2021 database lock was the 
time-based trigger of achieving a minimum follow-up of at least 12 months. 
At the time of the final PFS analysis, a formal interim analysis for OS was planned to be conducted. 
Analyses of OS and PFS in all randomized subjects were planned to be carried out at the time of the 
primary analysis in all randomized subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. OS and PFS in all 
randomized subjects were to be tested only if significance level was passed on them. As the OS 
comparisons were statistically significant at the interim analysis, OS analyses (database lock: 01-Mar-
2021) are considered final. 
Sensitivity analyses for OS and PFS 
Sensitivity analyses for both OS and PFS included the following: 
•  2-sided, unstratified log-rank test using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model with 
treatment as the single covariate.  
•  A multivariate adjusted, stratified Cox model was fitted to assess the treatment effect when 
adjusted for potential prognostic factors, including: age (< 65 vs ≥ 65), sex (male vs female), 
race (Asian vs. non-Asian), weight (< 60 kg vs ≥ 60 kg), disease status at current diagnosis 
(recurrent vs metastatic vs unresectable advanced), smoking status (current/former vs 
never/unknown), and alcohol use (current/former vs never/unknown). 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 59/168 
 
 
 
•  Max-combo analysis of OS and PFS per BICR when the KM curves indicated the HR was not 
constant over time, such as with a clear delayed separation. 
• 
PFS analysis accounting for assessment on/after subsequent therapy. PFS will be defined 
similarly to the primary definition except that events (progression or death) and disease 
assessments that occurred on or after subsequent anti-cancer therapy will be considered (no 
time point truncation). 
Two sensitivity analyses were not performed due to not meeting sample-size thresholds for analysis: 
analyses using stratification factors as obtained from the baseline CRF pages (instead of IRT) if > 10% 
of subjects with discordance, and analyses of subjects with no relevant deviation if > 10% of subjects 
with relevant protocol deviations. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
If any of the primary endpoints was significantly superior, the corresponding secondary endpoint of OS 
and PFS per BICR in all randomized subjects was compared using a two-sided log-rank test at the 
allocated significance level, stratified by: ECOG PS, number of organs with metastases, and tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1% or indeterminate) 
For each comparison, the HR with its associated two-sided 95% CI (in case the given endpoint is 
formally tested, also with the 100[1-α]% CI) was estimated via a stratified Cox model with treatment 
arm as the only covariate in the model. OS and PFS for each treatment arm were estimated and 
plotted using the KM product-limit method. Median OS and PFS with associated two-sided 95% CI were 
constructed based on a log-log transformed CI for the survival function. 
The same additional analyses were carried out for OS and PFS in all randomized subjects as for OS and 
PFS in all randomized subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 ≥ 1%. 
ORR (as assessed by BICR) in subjects with PD-L1 expressing tumours and in all randomized subjects 
was to be tested only if significance level is passed on them.  
ORR was computed in each treatment group along with the exact 95% CI using Clopper-Pearson 
method. An estimate of the difference in ORRs and corresponding 95% CI (in case the given endpoint 
is formally tested, also with the 100[1-α]% CI) were calculated using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
methodology  and adjusted by the stratification factors. The stratified (source: IRT) odds ratios 
(Mantel-Haenszel estimator) between the treatments were provided along with the 95% CI (in case 
the given endpoint is formally tested, also with the 100[1-α]% CI). 
Analysis of PRO 
Analysis of EQ-5D-3L and FACT-E (including FACT-G7 and ECS) data was performed in all randomized 
subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% and all randomized subjects who had a PRO assessment at 
baseline (assessment on or prior to first dose on Day 1) and at least 1 subsequent assessment while 
on treatment. EQ-5D-3L and FACT-E data were summarized of each dimension/category by 
assessment time point and changes from baseline.

wallichiana. Its use by this subject was considered as a prohibited concomitant medication. However, this particular 
therapy  is  not  considered  as  anti-cancer  therapy  by  the  Sponsor,  and  is,  thus,  not  a  prohibited  concomitant

Recruitment 
Enrolment in CA209648 study started on 29-June-2017 and was closed on 22-Nov-2019. The clinical 
cut-off occurred on 18-Jan-2021 (LPLV), clinical DBL occurred on 01-Mar-2021. The study is ongoing.  
This study was conducted at 187 sites in 26 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Peru, 
Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, United 
Kingdom [UK], and United States [US]). A total of 182 sites enrolled subjects (subjects were 
randomized at 175 sites). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol for this study was dated 01-Jun-2016. As of the 01-Mar-2021 DBL, there were a 
total of 5 global protocol revisions, with 1 global amendment; 12 country-specific revised protocols (5 
in the UK, 7 in France) and 12 country-specific amendments to address local requirements; 2 global 
administrative letters, and 1 country-specific administrative letter. 
Key global changes to the CA209648 protocol are explained as follows: 
•  Revised Protocol 01 incorporating Protocol Amendment 02 (dated 21-Dec-2016) changed 
CA209648 (originally planned as a Phase 2, 2-arm study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. 
chemotherapy in oesophageal and gastric cancer) into a randomized global, Phase 3, 3-arm 
study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab combined with fluorouracil plus cisplatin 
compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil in subjects with inoperable advanced, recurrent or 
metastatic, previously untreated OSCC. The expansion of the oesophageal cohort into a 3-arm 
randomized Phase 3 study addressed a high unmet medical need in 1L OSCC. The gastric 
cohort was removed. This amendment applied to all sites. Note that enrolment to CA209648 
was initiated after the approval and implementation of Amendment 02 (i.e., no subjects were 
enrolled prior to Amendment 02). 
•  Revised Protocol 05 (dated 29-Oct-2020) added another trigger for the interim analysis (Final 
PFS/Interim OS).  
Per Revised Protocol 01, the planned interim analysis (PFS final analysis and OS interim 
analysis) was to be triggered when 136 PFS events per BICR were observed among subjects 
expressing at least 1% tumour cell PD-L1 in the chemotherapy arm (Arm C). PFS event 
tracking was conducted by an independent external statistical group (AXIO), which supported 
statistical analyses and generated reports for review by an independent DMC. BMS remained 
blinded to the number of PFS events in Arm A and Arm B. Event tracking commenced in Jul-

2020. PFS events were observed to be tracking at a much slower rate than projected per 
protocol. This was largely due to censoring due to the start of subsequent therapy or 
withdrawal of consent prior to progression, the extent of which was unforeseen when the 
Revised Protocol 01 was developed.  
The revised protocol allowed for the final PFS analysis to be triggered when 136 PFS events per 
BICR were observed among the subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% in the chemotherapy 
arm, or when at least 12 months minimum follow-up (defined as the time from the date the 
last patient was randomized to the clinical cut-off date) was reached. In the eventuality that 
the target number of PFS events was not reached, the 12 months minimum follow-up ensured 
adequate follow-up for PFS in this patient population. As per original design, OS IA was to be 
conducted at the same time as PFS FA, and the alpha allocation was to be calculated per the 
specified method.

Summary of Key Global Changes 
• 
• 
• 
• 
CA209648 (originally planned as a Phase 2 study in 
oesophageal and gastric cancer) was amended into 
a randomized global Phase 3 study of nivo + ipi or 
nivo + chemo compared with chemo (cisplatin and 
fluorouracil) in subjects with inoperable advanced, 
recurrent  or  metastatic,  previously  untreated 
OSCC.  The  expansion  of  the  oesophageal  cohort 
into a 3-arm randomized Phase 3 study addresses 
a high unmet medical need in first line OSCC. The 
gastric cohort was removed. 
Clarified terminology in description of study 
subjects, replacing “inoperable” with 
“unresectable” advanced, recurrent or metastatic 
oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma to ensure 
consistency of terminology used across the study 
protocol. 
Rationale for Arm B nivolumab dose updated to 
reflect current approval by FDA of nivolumab 240 
mg Q2W for a variety of tumour types, and under 
review by other health authorities. 
Clarified that an evaluable PD-L1 IHC test result 
by central lab would be required for 
randomization. 
•  Other changes to align with the IB, simplify 
procedures, and provide clarifications. 
• 
• 
• 
Removed the procedures for the reinitiation of 
nivo ± ipi treatment after disease progression for 
up to 1 additional year. In addition, it added 
clarification to the treatment beyond progression 
procedures to limit treatment to a maximum 
duration of 24 months. There is minimal, if any, 
benefit derived from continuing IO treatment 
beyond 2 years in advanced tumours. Treatment 
beyond 2 years is no longer allowed in studies 
with nivolumab. 
Restricted study entry to participants of previous 
nivolumab clinical studies where OS was listed as 
a primary or co-primary endpoint since 
participation in CA209648 could confound the 
interpretation of efficacy results in these studies. 
Live /attenuated vaccines were prohibited to 
address any potential safety risks.

Inclusion  criterion  related 
assessment was expanded to allow consideration of 
measured creatinine clearance instead of calculated 
creatinine clearance per Cockcroft-Gault formula on 
the  basis  that  measured  creatinine  clearance 
represents  an  accurate  estimation  of  glomerular 
filtration rate. 
Cisplatin infusion times longer than 120 minutes 
were allowed if deemed necessary by investigator 
per local standard of care/local label. 
PFS2/TSST was added as an exploratory endpoint 
to help understand the relevance of meaningful 
improvements in PFS. 
Biomarker assessments section was revised to 
reflect current prioritizations in the biomarker 
analyses plan. 
Program updates were added and internal 
inconsistencies were corrected. 
Added provision for triggering the planned IA when 
at least 12 months minimum follow-up is reached, 
in the eventuality that the planned 136 PFS events 
per  BICR  among  subjects  with  tumour  cell  PD-L1 
≥1% in the chemotherapy arm was unlikely to be 
reached.  If  the  target  number  of  PFS  events  was 
not  reached,  the  12  months  minimum  follow-up 
ensured adequate follow-up for PFS in this patient 
population.

Important Protocol Deviations (IPDs), previously known as Significant Protocol Deviations (SPDs), are 
a subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or 
reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject's rights, safety, or well-being. 
A total of 404 IPDs/SPDs were reported among all enrolled subjects.

Note that the grand total is the sum of all IPDs/SPDs, but not the total of all subjects with IPDs/SPDs, 
as one subject may have more than one deviation. 
The window for tumor assessments were every 6 weeks (±7 days) from first dose up to and including 
Week  48,  then  every  12 weeks  (±7  days)  regardless  of  treatment  schedule until disease  progression 
(unless treatment beyond progression was permitted). The SAE reporting window was 24 hours. 
a Treatment discontinuation criteria are listed in Section 4.5.5 of the CA209648 protocol. 
b For Subject CA209648-xx-xxxx (chemo arm), as part of continued periodic, administrative review of 
PDs, it was discovered after the Erratum to the CA209648 Primary CSR was prepared that this occurrence 
did  not  meet  criteria  for  an  IPD.  The  subject  was  recorded  as  having  progressed,  and  discontinued 
treatment 9 days later. 
Relevant protocol deviations (RPDs) are IPDs that could affect the interpretability of key study results, 
are programmable deviations from clinical database, and are protocol-specific. 
A total of 5 (0.5%) subjects reported with at least 1 RPD among all randomized subjects; the 
proportions of subjects with at least 1 RPD and the individual RPDs were as follows:

Nivo + chemo (2 subjects [0.6%]):  
­  1 subject (0.3%) at study entry without squamous cell carcinoma or adenosquamous cell 
carcinoma of the oesophagus. This subject had sarcomatoid carcinoma of the oesophagus and 
was randomized but never treated. 
­  1 subject (0.3%) was reported by the investigator to have received concurrent anti-cancer 
therapies, specifically botanical formulations and traditional medicines used for cancer 
treatment: Glycyrrhiza spp. root, Panax ginseng root, and taxus wallichiana. Its use by this 
subject was considered as a prohibited concomitant medication. However, this particular 
therapy is not considered as anti-cancer therapy by the Sponsor, and is, thus, not a prohibited 
concomitant medication for this study. 
Nivo + ipi: 0 subjects 
Chemo (3 subjects [0.9%]):  
­  1 subject (0.3%) without measurable disease at baseline. 
­  2 subjects (0.6%) who received concurrent anti-cancer therapies, specifically botanical 
formulations and traditional medicines used for cancer treatment: Astragalus spp. root, 
cantharidin, Eleutherococcus senticosus root with rhizome, and Panax ginseng root.

subjects were considered as having tumour cell PD-L1 < 1% for IRT-based stratification but were 
considered separately in subgroup analyses of efficacy and were not included in the safety subgroups 
analyses.

Previous treatments 
Among all randomized subjects, 23.3% received prior systemic anticancer therapy in the adjuvant, 
neo-adjuvant, or definitive chemotherapy/radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy (CRT) treatment setting, 
with similar proportions of subjects observed across treatment arms. Prior surgery related to cancer or

radiotherapy was reported in 29.7% and 19.9% of subjects, respectively, and similar proportions of 
subjects were observed across treatment arms. 
Note that, due to a data entry error, 1 (0.4%) subject in the chemo arm was reported to have received 
prior treatment in the metastatic setting with vinorelbine; however, this subject received vinorelbine as 
subsequent therapy. 
In subjects with prior systemic therapy, the time from prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant, neo-
adjuvant, or definitive CRT treatment setting to randomization was similar across treatment arms, with 
study treatment for most subjects starting 6 to < 12 months (39.6%) or ≥ 12 months (53.8%) after 
prior treatment.

Among all randomized subjects (N = 970), 226 (23.3%) subjects received anti-neoplastic agents, 
which were primarily cisplatin (16.2%) and/or fluorouracil (15.6%). These drugs were used at similar 
proportions across the treatment arms:  
­  Nivo + chemo arm: 15.3% received prior cisplatin and 16.8% received prior fluorouracil 
­  Nivo + ipi arm: 17.8% received prior cisplatin and 14.5% received prior fluorouracil 
­  Chemo arm: 15.4% received prior cisplatin and 15.4% received prior fluorouracil 
No subject received immunotherapy prior to randomization. 
Subsequent anti-cancer therapy 
More subjects in the chemo arm (62.7%) compared with the nivo + chemo (50.8%) and nivo + ipi 
(51.7%) arms initiated any subsequent therapy. Proportions of all randomized subjects who received 
subsequent cancer therapy in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo arms were as follows, 
respectively: 
­  Subsequent systemic therapy: 46.4%, 46.5%, and 55.9%. 
­  Subsequent anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy: 5.0%, 4.3%, and 15.7% 
One subject in the nivo + ipi arm received ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab as subsequent 
therapy.

(1) Subject may have received more than one type of subsequent therapy. Subsequent therapy was defined as 
therapy started on or after first dosing date (randomization date if subject never treated).

Outcomes and estimation 
The current initial analyses of efficacy data were based on a clinical data cut-off of 18-Jan-2021 (LPLV) 
and a clinical database lock (DBL) of 01 Mar-2021. Minimum follow-up (date the last patient was 
randomized to the clinical cut-off date) for OS was 12.9 months for the comparison of nivo + chemo 
vs. chemo and 13.1 months for the comparison of nivo + ipi vs. chemo. Across arms, the median 
follow-up was 23.7 months (range: 12.9, 40.7 months). 
During the procedure, updated efficacy data with a minimum follow-up of 20 months based on a DBL 
of 04-Oct-2021 were provided.  
Data presented below are based on the initial DBL (01 Mar 2021) unless otherwise specified.

In all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant improvement in OS was observed with nivo + ipi vs. chemo. The OS HR was 0.64 
(98.6% CI: 0.46, 0.90) with a stratified 2-sided log-rank test p-value = 0.0010. Median OS (95% CI) 
was longer in the nivo + ipi arm compared with the chemo arm: 13.70 (11.24, 17.02) vs. 9.07 (7.69, 
9.95) months, with non-overlapping CIs. OS rates (95% CI) in the nivo + ipi vs. chemo arms were as 
follows: 
−  At 6 months: 74.44% (66.84, 80.55) vs. 72.80% (64.83, 79.26) 
−  At 12 months: 57.11% (48.97, 64.44) vs. 37.07% (29.22, 44.91)  
The KM curves crossed at approximately 6 months favoring nivo + ipi over chemo, with an increased 
separation over time. 
52 (32.9%) subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 36 (22.9%) subjects in the chemo arm were censored 
for OS at DBL. Of the censored subjects, 11/52 (21.2%) and 0 subjects in the nivo + ipi and chemo 
arms, respectively, were continuing on-treatment and 37/52 (71.2%) and 19/36 (52.8%) subjects in 
the nivo + ipi and chemo arms, respectively, were in follow-up. Of the subjects off study in the nivo + 
ipi (n = 4) and chemo (n = 17) arms, all 4 of the subjects in the nivo + chemo arm and 
15/17 subjects in the chemo arm withdrew consent. 
Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of subjects: 98.1% of subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 
89.8% of subjects in the chemo arm either died or had a last known alive date on or after the clinical 
cutoff date (18-Jan-2021). 
Results for the following sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary OS analysis: 
−  Unstratified analysis with treatment as the single covariate: HR = 0.62 (98.6% CI: 0.45, 
0.87); 2-sided unstratified log-rank test descriptive p-value = 0.0005.  
−  Max-combo analysis of OS data: HR = 0.52 (adjusted 95% CI: 0.39, 0.69), descriptive p-value 
< 0.0001. 
− 
− 
In the post-hoc analysis of piecewise HRs for the nivo + ipi vs. chemo comparison, HRs were 
> 1.00 from study start to 4 months and < 1.00 thereafter. HRs (95% CI) by interval: 1.45 
(0.59, 3.54) for 0 to ≤ 2 months, 1.57 (0.51, 4.82) for > 2 to ≤ 3 months, 3.15 (1.02, 9.78) 
for > 3 to ≤ 4 months, 0.64 (0.21, 1.96) for > 4 to ≤ 5 months, 0.21 (0.06, 0.71) for > 5 to ≤ 
6 months, and 0.50 (0.35, 0.69) for > 6 months. 
In a multivariate analysis of OS, the treatment effect of nivo + ipi vs chemo was consistent 
with the primary OS analysis: HR = 0.62, 95.0% CI: 0.47, 0.82; multivariate Cox model 
descriptive p-value = 0.0007.

In all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, the PFS per BICR (primary 
definition) results for nivo + ipi vs. chemo did not meet the criteria for statistical significance: 
HR =  1.02 (98.5% CI: 0.73, 1.43; p = 0.8958). Median PFS per BICR (95% CI) was 4.04 (2.40, 4.93) 
and 4.44 (2.89, 5.82) months in the nivo + ipi vs. chemo arms, respectively. PFS rates (95% CI) in 
the nivo + ipi and chemo arms were as follows: 
−  At 6 months: 34.83% (27.26, 42.48) vs. 39.04% (30.07, 47.90) 
−  At 12 months: 26.40% (19.45, 33.85) vs. 10.45% (4.71, 18.84) 
Results for PFS per BICR accounting for assessment on/after subsequent therapy (ie, including events

Secondary endpoints 
o  Overall survival - All Randomized Subjects  
A statistically significant improvement in OS was observed for all randomized subjects with nivo + ipi 
vs. chemo. Minimum follow-up for OS in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms was 13.1 months. The OS HR 
was 0.78 (98.2% CI: 0.62, 0.98); stratified 2-sided log-rank test p-value = 0.0110. Median OS (95% 
CI) was approximately 2 months longer in the nivo + ipi arm compared to the chemo arm: 12.75 
(11.27, 15.47) vs. 10.71 (9.40, 11.93) months. Landmark OS rates (95% CI) for nivo + ipi vs. chemo 
were as follows: 
−  At 6 months: 74.03% (68.85, 78.49) vs. 75.85% (70.65, 80.26) 
−  At 12 months: 53.50% (47.83, 58.83) vs. 44.32% (38.63, 49.85) 
The KM curves for nivo + ipi over chemo crossed at approximately 6.5 months, with an increased 
separation over time favoring nivo + ipi over chemo.

109 (33.5%) subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 92 (28.4%) subjects in the chemo arm were censored 
for OS at DBL. Of the censored subjects, 21/109 (19.3%) and 4/92 (4.3%) subjects in the nivo + ipi 
and chemo arms, respectively, were continuing on-treatment and 72/109 (66.1%) and 57/92 (62.0%) 
subjects in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms, respectively, were in follow-up. The majority of subjects 
who were off study in the nivo + ipi (N = 16) and chemo (N = 31) arms, withdrew consent: 10/16 
(62.5%) and 27/31 (87.1%), respectively. 
Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of subjects: 95.4% of subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 
91.0% of subjects in the chemo arm either died or had a last known alive date on or after the clinical 
cutoff date (18-Jan-2021). 
Results for the following sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary OS analysis: 
−  Unstratified analysis with treatment as the single covariate: HR = 0.78 (98.2% CI: 0.62, 
0.98); 2-sided unstratified log-rank descriptive p-value = 0.0088. 
−  Max-combo analysis of OS data: HR = 0.67 (adjusted 95% CI: 0.55, 0.81), descriptive p-value 
< 0.0001. 
− 
In the post-hoc analysis of piecewise HRs for the nivo + ipi vs chemo comparison, HRs were 
> 1.00 from study start to 4 months and < 1.00 thereafter. HRs (95% CI) by interval: 2.02 
(1.07, 3.82) for 0 to ≤ 2 months, 1.36 (0.64, 2.88) for > 2 to ≤ 3 months, 1.96 (0.94, 4.09) 
for > 3 to ≤ 4 months, 0.79 (0.33, 1.87) for > 4 to ≤ 5 months, 0.39 (0.18, 0.83) for > 5 to ≤ 
6 months, and 0.63 (0.49, 0.79) for > 6 months.  
− 
In a multivariate analysis of OS, the treatment effect of nivo + ipi vs chemo was consistent 
with the primary OS analysis: HR = 0.77, 95.0% CI: 0.63, 0.93; multivariate Cox model 
descriptive p value = 0.0064.

o  Progression-free Survival - All Randomized Subjects  
In all randomized subjects, the HR for PFS per BICR for nivo + ipi vs. chemo was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.04, 
1.52). Median PFS per BICR (95% CI) was 2.92 (2.66, 4.17) and 5.59 (4.27, 5.88) months in the 
nivo + ipi and chemo arms, respectively. PFS rates (95% CI) in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms were as 
follows, respectively: 
−  At 6 months: 31.69% (26.50, 37.00) vs. 43.15% (36.96, 49.19) 
−  At 12 months: 22.70% (17.99, 27.75) vs. 16.02% (11.02, 21.86) 
Results for the sensitivity analyses were as follows: 
­  Max-combo analysis when the proportionality assumption did not hold: HR = 0.81 (adjusted 
95% CI: 0.65, 1.01). 
­  The post-hoc analysis comparing the RMST of PFS per BICR between nivo + ipi and chemo was 
performed when the proportionality assumption did not hold. Long-term PFS benefit was 
demonstrated with nivo + ipi vs chemo, with a difference over time favoring nivo + ipi over

chemo: -0.83 (-1.15, -0.51) at 6 months, 0.90 ( 1.58, -0.22) at 12 months, -0.11 ( 1.34, 
1.11) at 24 months, and 0.35 ( 1.27, 1.98) at 33.3 months 
Results for the PFS analysis accounting for assessment on/after subsequent therapy (ie, including 
events and disease assessments that occurred on or after subsequent anti-cancer therapy) were as 
follows: HR =1.09 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.29).

o  Objective Response Rate - All Randomized Subjects with Tumour Cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
In all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, an improvement in BICR-assessed 
ORR (95% CI) was observed with nivo + ipi vs. chemo, with non-overlapping CIs: 35.4% (28.0, 43.4) 
vs 19.7% (13.8, 26.8), respectively. CRs per BICR were observed in 28 (17.7%) subjects in the nivo + 
ipi arm vs. 8 (5.1%) subjects in the chemo arm. 
ORR (95% CI) per investigator for nivo + ipi and chemo were comparable to those per BICR 39.9% 
(32.2, 48.0) and 22.9% (16.6, 30.3).

Exploratory endpoints 
o  PFS by Investigator in All Randomized Subjects with Tumour Cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
In all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 ≥ 1%, analysis of PFS assessed by investigator showed 
an improved HR compared with the BICR-based primary analysis, favoring nivo + ipi over chemo: HR = 
0.83 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.07). Median PFS (95% CI) in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms was 4.01 (2.66, 
5.42) vs. 4.21 (3.06, 5.39) months. Landmark rates of PFS by investigator in the nivo + ipi vs. chemo 
arms were 36.16% (95% CI: 28.64, 43.71) vs 32.94% (95% CI: 24.95, 41.14) at 6 months and 26.25%

o  Time to response and duration of Response - All Responders 
Among responders per BICR in the nivo + ipi (N = 90) vs. chemo (N = 87) arms: 
Median TTR (min, max) per BICR was similar in the nivo + ipi (1.51 [1.2, 8.4] months) and chemo (1.51 
[1.1, 9.7] months) arms. 
Median DOR (95% CI) was numerically longer with nivo + ipi vs. chemo: 11.07 (8.31, 14.00) vs. 7.13 
(5.65,  8.21)  months  and  separation  of  the  KM  curves  favoring  nivo  +  ipi  over  chemo  began  at 
approximately 6 months. In the nivo + ipi vs. chemo arms, 66% (55%, 75%) vs. 54% (41%, 65%) of 
subjects  had  a  DOR  (95%  CI)  of  at  least  6  months,  and  48%  (36%,  58%)  vs.  23%  (13%,  34%)  of 
subjects had a DOR (95% CI) of at least 12 months. 
o  PFS2/TSST - All Randomized Subjects with Tumor Cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
A  numerical  improvement  in  PFS2/TSST  per  investigator  was  observed  with  nivo  +  ipi  compared  to 
chemo in all randomized subjects with tumor cell PD-L1 ≥ 1%: 
Median PFS2/TSST (95% CI) per investigator was numerically longer with nivo + ipi vs. chemo: 9.86 
(8.48, 12.16) vs. 7.06 (6.54, 7.82) months. The HR favored nivo + ipi over chemo, with the upper bound

o  PFS2/TSST - All Randomized Subjects 
A  numerical  improvement  in  PFS2/TSST  per  investigator  was  observed  with  nivo  +  ipi  compared  to 
chemo in all randomized subjects: 
Median PFS2/TSST (95% CI) per investigator was numerically longer with nivo + ipi vs. chemo: 9.72 
(8.48, 11.24) vs. 7.89 (7.13, 8.44) months. The HR favoured nivo + ipi over chemo, with the upper 
bound of the 95% CI below 1: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.88).  
51.7% vs. 62.7% of subjects, respectively, received subsequent cancer therapy. Among subjects who 
did not receive any subsequent cancer therapy, 68 (20.9%) vs. 42 (13.0%) were censored, 
respectively (Table S.5.114.3). Among subjects who received at least 1 subsequent cancer therapy, 18 
(5.5%) vs. 22 (6.8%) were censored, respectively.

and  p=0.0278  for  OS  from  the  Cox  proportional hazard  model,  indicating  that  there  was  as  signal of 
interaction between treatment and baseline tumour cell PD-L1 status at the 1% cut-off for PFS per BICR 
and OS at a prespecified significance level of 0.2.

Subgroup analyses 
In a subgroup analysis of all randomized subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, OS HRs 
(95% CIs) for all but one subgroup favoured nivo + ipi over chemo (point estimate of HR < 1). The 
point estimate of HR for the Rest of Asia region subgroup was 1.00. However, the number of subjects 
in this subgroup was small (n = 48), and the 95% CI of the HR was wide (0.53, 1.88); thus, 
interpretation of this result is limited.

Early deaths 
Based on visual evaluation of the OS Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, an early crossing in the OS K-M 
curves between nivo +ipi and chemo arms occurred at approximately 6.5 months, suggesting an initial 
higher survival rate with the chemo arm compared with the nivo + ipi arm. Thus, exploratory post-hoc 
analyses were conducted in CA209648, to identify the first timepoint when the smoothed hazards were 
equal thus define the timing cut-off of early death, to assess the potential risks of early death for nivo 
+ ipi vs. chemo, and to investigate baseline demographic and disease characteristics of patients for 
whom nivo + ipi may not provide a treatment benefit due to the initial increase in the risk of early 
death. The analyses conducted are based on data from CA209648 with the DBL of 01-Mar-2021. The 
population for analyses was limited to all randomized subjects in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms for the 
study. 
A stratified piecewise Cox-regression model with treatment arm as covariate was produced for all 
randomized subjects of the nivo + ipi and chemo arms. Piecewise time intervals were defined as 0-2, 
> 2-3, > 3-4, > 4-5, > 5-6, and > 6 months. The point estimate of the piecewise HR of death between 
the 2 arms was evaluated for each of these time intervals. Based on the stratified piecewise Cox-
regression model, a higher piecewise HR was noted for nivo + ipi arm vs. chemo arm up to 4 months 
(HR between 0-2 months: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.07 - 3.82; HR between 2-3 months: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.64 - 
2.88; and HR between 3-4 months: 1.96, 95% CI: 0.94 - 4.09). The piecewise HRs became < 1 in 
favour of nivo + ipi starting from Month 4, and remained < 1 between 5-6 months, and > 6 months. 
Table 24. Piecewise Hazard Ratios of Overall Survival - All Randomized Subjects in the Nivolumab + 
Ipilimumab and Chemotherapy Arms 
A plot of smoothed instantaneous hazard of death for each treatment arm was produced in all 
randomized subjects of the nivo + ipi and chemo arms. The first time point when the smoothed curves 
of instantaneous hazard of death for two treatment arms crossed (i.e., hazards of death were equal) 
was at 4.05 months. An early death was defined as a death of a subject with a death date prior to or 
on 4.05 months (subjects censored prior to or on 4.05 months were considered as having non-early 
deaths), after which any potential risk of death was no longer higher in the nivo + ipi arm. The 
instantaneous hazard rates were equal at 19.5, 21 and 25 months, which reflected fluctuations in the 
hazard of death driven by the small numbers of events.

the Nivolumab + Ipilimumab and Chemotherapy Arms 
The piecewise HRs and instantaneous hazards in the subgroups of subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 
≥1% or <1% were consistent with the results in all randomized subjects. 
Early deaths (i.e. a death prior to or on 4.05 months after randomization) were reported for 66/325 
(20.3%) and 38/324 (11.7%) randomized subjects, in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms, respectively.  
The cause of death in the early-death population was summarized by treatment arm in the table

Table 27. Incidence of Early Death with ≥ 10% Difference in Pre-defined Subsets - All Randomized 
Subjects in the Nivolumab + Ipilimumab and Chemotherapy Arms 
The identified treatment-specific risk factors were included in the multivariate logistic model along with 
their interaction with treatment in all randomized subjects pooling the nivo + ipi and the chemo arms 
together. The final multivariate logistic regression model included risk factors identified within each 
treatment arm and their interaction terms with treatment if the p-value was less than 0.15.  
The final model identified the following poor prognostic factors: non-Asia region (p < 0.001), baseline 
neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ≥ 4 (p = 0.001), baseline tumour burden (≥ Q3, p = 0.003), ECOG PS of 
1 (p = 0.006), and male (p = 0.088). The final model included the interactions of treatment arm with 
liver metastases (p < 0.001), never/unknown alcohol use (p = 0.078), and weight (p = 0.123), which 
had p-values less than 0.15. Neither tumour cell PD-L1 nor PD-L1 by CPS was identified as a risk factor 
for early death, in either univariate or multivariate logistic model.

Analyses to support contribution of components 
In order to evaluate the contribution of the ipilimumab component in the nivo + ipi regimen in 
CA209648, analyses were pre-specified in the CSR SAP version 4.0 Section 8.0 to compare the efficacy 
data descriptively between the nivo + ipi and nivo + chemo arms.

Yervoy (ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic 
oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).  
An application has been submitted in parallel for a new indication for nivolumab in combination with 
chemotherapy for the same target population (EMEA/H/C/3985/II/107).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is based on the results of study CA209648, a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study 
of nivolumab+ipilimumab or nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy (fluorouracil plus cisplatin) 
versus chemotherapy (fluorouracil plus cisplatin) in patients with recurrent or metastatic previously 
untreated OSCC. Overall, the study design can be considered adequate to support a marketing 
authorisation in the claimed indication. 
The study was open-label. However, considering the primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and 
progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), this is 
considered acceptable.  
Patient population 
Overall, inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered acceptable. Patients with an advanced disease 
of squamous cell histology, who were treatment-naïve and had a good performance status (ECOG 0 or 
1), were enrolled in the study. Patients with brain or meninx metastasis were only allowed to enter the 
study if asymptomatic and not requiring treatment. This population can be considered representative 
of a patient population for which chemotherapy is considered the standard of care. 
Patients were included in the study regardless of tumour cell PD-L1 expression. However, tumour 
tissue was required for PD-L1 expression determination by a central lab. Patients with non-evaluable 
results were not allowed to enter the study. 
Treatments  
Nivolumab was used at a dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W. This 
regimen has been used in previous clinical trials (e.g. study CA209743 in patients with malignant 
pleural mesothelioma) and therefore is considered acceptable.

With regards to the comparator (5-FU+cisplatin), it is considered adequate since this is one of the 
regimens recommended in the current guidelines for the treatment of advanced oesophageal cancer. 
In the NCCN guideline a combination of fluoropyrimidine (either 5-FU or capecitabine) and cisplatin or 
oxaliplatin are the preferred recommended regimens1. Use of oxaliplatin is also preferred over cisplatin 
due to lower toxicity. According to the ESMO guideline the value of palliative chemotherapy is less 
clear for OSCC than for oesophageal adenocarcinoma, although reference to cisplatin combinations is 
made2.  
The recommended regimen in the CA209648 study was 5-FU 800 mg/m2 IV for 5 days (days 1 to 5) 
plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV on day 1, cycled every 4 weeks. As stated by the MAH, the 5-FU+cisplatin 
regimen varies among countries. Current NCCN guidelines recommend 5-FU (750 - 1000 mg/m² on 
Days 1 - 4) plus cisplatin (75 - 100 mg/m² on Day 1) every 4 weeks. The proposed regimen is 
considered acceptable.  
Further, the proposed posology in the PI is 3 mg/kg nivolumab Q2W or 360 mg Q3W in combination 
with 1 mg/kg ipilimumab Q6W. The justification for the additional posology for nivolumab (i.e. 360 mg 
Q3W) is mainly based on pharmacology data (see PK/PD section). 
According to the protocol, treatment beyond radiological confirmed progression was allowed if the 
subject had investigator-assessed clinical benefit and was tolerating treatment. There were 81 patients 
(42 patients with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%) in the nivo+ipi arm who were treated beyond 
progression, with a median treatment duration of 1.12 months (range: 0.1, 22.6). According to the 
MAH among patients treated beyond progression there were patients with confirmed disease 
progression and patients for whom disease progression was doubtful and that required further 
confirmation. The MAH stated that treatment beyond progression was not allowed in the chemo arm, 
however, investigator could continue study therapy while awaiting the RECIST 1.1 assessment. There 
were 23 patients in the chemo arm that received treatment beyond progression. In response to the 
follow-up request received the MAH provided the total duration of treatment and duration of post-
progression treatment in patients with tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and in patients with tumor 
cell PD-L1 < 1%. The data presented for both tumor cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% and tumor cell PD-L1 < 1% 
show that some patients treated with nivo + ipi or nivo + chemo received therapy up to several 
months after investigator-assessed progression. The continuation of therapy beyond progression in this 
subset of patients indicates the investigator’s assessment of continued benefit, as treatment was to be 
discontinued at the time of progression in the absence of ongoing clinical benefit. 
According to the protocol, treatment beyond radiological confirmed progression was allowed if the 
subject had investigator-assessed clinical benefit and was tolerating treatment. Considering the 
population of patients with tumour cell PD-L1≥1%, there were 42 patients in the nivo+ipi arm who 
were treated beyond progression, with a median treatment duration of 1.10 months (range: 0.1, 
16.8). According to the MAH among patients treated beyond progression there were patients with 
confirmed disease progression and patients for whom disease progression was doubtful and that 
required further confirmation. The MAH was requested to provide separate numbers of the patients 
that received treatment beyond unequivocal progression and those who received treatment while 
awaiting confirmation/rejection of progression, but these data were not available. Treatment beyond 
progression was not allowed in the chemo arm, however, investigator could continue study therapy 
while awaiting the RECIST 1.1 assessment. There were 13 patients with PD-L1≥1% in the chemo arm 
that received treatment beyond progression with a median treatment duration of 0.23 months (range: 
0.1,  4.3). Bearing in mind that the number of patients with a long duration of treatment was low (only 
5 patients in the nivo+ipi arm received treatment for more than 4 months, which was the maximum

reported in the chemo arm where treatment beyond progression was not allowed), it is considered 
unlikely that this may have impacted the (OS) results. No further actions are considered necessary.  
Endpoints 
The dual primary endpoints of the study were OS and PFS (as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 criteria) 
in patients with PD-L1≥1%. Secondary endpoints included OS and PFS in all randomised subjects and 
ORR  (both  in  PD-L1≥1%  and  the  overall  population,  by  BICR).  Duration  of  response,  PFS  and  ORR 
according to investigator assessment, PFS2/TSST and PRO were exploratory endpoints. The choice of 
the primary and secondary endpoints is considered appropriate.  
Sample size 
The operating characteristics concerning the sample size calculation are clearly described. The MAH has 
assumed the same distributions for OS and PFS and a piecewise mixture cure rate model was applied 
for  the  current  design.  Overall,  the  proposal  for  the  sample  size  is  acceptable  and  meets  regulatory 
requirements. 
Statistical analysis 
The MAH has designed a graphical testing strategy to control the Type I Error through different endpoints 
and in particular, the primary endpoints and a number of secondary endpoints were tested using the 
Bonferroni-based  graphical  approach  by  Maurer  and  Bretz  (2013).  Overall,  the  strategy  is  considered 
acceptable.  
Regarding the analysis of OS, the MAH planned to perform an interim analysis (IA) for OS at the time 
the  PFS  final  analysis  was  triggered.  The  decision  was  foreseen  when  136  PFS  events  were observed 
among the population selected for the primary analysis in the chemo arm. The tracking was conducted 
by an independent external statistical group (AXIO). In the revised protocol v05, the MAH decided to 
add  an  additional  criterion  to  trigger  the  PFS  final  analysis  (and  OS  interim  analysis),  a  12-month 
minimum follow-up since the collection of PFS events were slow.  
Concerning the primary analyses, the MAH has considered the hypothetical strategy; in particular the 
MAH has censored the intercurrent events which deals with the administration of subsequent therapy 
and  withdrawal  of  consent.  Sensitivity  analyses  considering  intercurrent  events  as  events  were 
consistent with the primary analyses.  
Study conduct 
The study was originally designed as a Phase 2 study of nivolumab monotherapy (Arm A) and in 
combination with ipilimumab (Arm B) in subjects with advanced or metastatic previously treated 
gastric, GEJ or previously untreated oesophageal cancer. With amendment 2, the study was modified 
into a randomized Phase 3 study with three treatment arms including only patients with squamous 
oesophageal cancer. At the time of this amendment no patients had been randomised.  
Afterwards several further changes were performed although it is not considered that these changes 
could have impacted the results. Of importance, with revision 5 (dated 29 Oct 2020) a time-based 
trigger for the IA (final PFS/IA OS) was added.  
Five patients had relevant protocol deviations (2 subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 3 subjects in the 
chemo arm). One subject in the nivo+chemo arm had sarcomatoid carcinoma of the oesophagus, 
although this patient was not treated; a second patient in the chemo arm, entered the study without 
measurable disease at baseline; and there were 3 patients that received concurrent traditional 
medicines used for cancer treatment (botanical formulations). No relevant protocol deviations were 
reported in the nivo+ipi arm. Taking into account the low number of patients with protocol deviations 
no impact on the results is expected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 112/168 
 
 
 
The MAH has provided information on important protocol deviations (IPDs), which according to the 
MAH reflect protocol deviations that may significantly impact completeness, accuracy and/or reliability 
of the study data. A total of 404 IPDs were reported among all enrolled subjects (151 in the 
nivo+chemo arm, 115 in the nivo+ipi arm, 132 in the chemo arm and 6 in patients who were not 
randomised). After a review of the reported IPDs, it is not considered that this could have impacted the 
results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline characteristics 
The median age of patients included in the study was 64 (range: 26, 90) years. There were 84 (8.7%) 
patients who were 75 years or older. Demographics and other baseline characteristics were overall well 
balanced between treatment arms. 
With regards to prior treatment, 23% of patients had received prior systemic therapy in the 
neoadjuvant (55%) or adjuvant (17%) setting, or definitive CRT therapy (30%). Prior radiotherapy 
was received by around 20% of patients. 
The proportion of patients that received subsequent systemic therapy was comparable between 
treatment arms (51.7% nivo+ipi and 55.9% chemo). In the chemo group, a higher number of patients 
received anti-PD-(L)1 therapy (15.7% vs. 4.3%), mainly nivolumab. In contrast, 5-FU and cisplatin 
were among the most frequent subsequent therapies received in the nivo+ipi arm.  
Efficacy outcomes 
The efficacy data provided are based on a clinical data cut-off of 18 Jan 2021 and a clinical DBL of 1 
Mar 2021, with a median follow-up of 23.7 months (range: 12.9, 40.7). The submission is based on 
results of the final analysis of PFS and an IA of OS, which is now considered the final analysis.  
The study met its primary objective since the combination of nivo+ipi demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in OS compared with chemo (HR 0.64; 98.6% CI: 0.46, 0.90) in the primary 
efficacy population (i.e. PD-L1≥1%). The median OS was of 13.7 (95% CI: 11.24, 17.02) months in 
the nivo+ipi arm vs. 9.07 (95% CI: 7.69, 9.95) months in the chemo arm. However, no statistically 
significant differences were observed in PFS, as assessed by BICR (HR 1.02; 98.5% CI: 0.73, 1.43). 
PFS analysis according to the investigator was consistent with the primary analysis (HR 0.83; 95% CI: 
0.64, 1.07). Sensitivity analyses, including PFS per BICR accounting for assessment on/after 
subsequent therapy (HR 0.85; 98.5% CI: 0.63, 1.15), were overall in line with the primary analysis.  
Since PFS did not meet the criteria for statistical significance in the PD-L1≥1% population, as per the 
hierarchical testing strategy, PFS in the all-randomised patients was not formally tested (HR 1.26; 
95% CI: 1.04, 1.52); neither was ORR. 
In the all-randomised patients, with 216 (66.5%) events in the nivo+ipi arm and 232 (71.6%) in the 
chemo arms (87.2% of the target final number of OS events), a statistically significant improvement in 
OS was observed with nivo+ipi over chemo (HR 0.78; 98.2% CI: 0.62, 0.98). Median OS was of 12.75 
months vs. 10.71 months, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Notwithstanding the above, there was a higher rate of early deaths in the nivo+ipi arm, with crossing 
of the KM curves at approximately 6.5 months. Exploratory post-hoc analyses were carried out. Early 
deaths were defined as deaths that occurred during the first 4 months (4.05 moths). During this 
period, 66 patients died in the nivo+ipi arm compared with 38 patients in the chemo arm. The main 
cause of death was disease progression (45 [68.2%] vs. 30 [78.9%], respectively), followed by a 
cause named as “other” (13 [19.7% nivo+ipi vs. 2 [5.3%] chemo).  According to these analyses, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 113/168 
 
 
 
presence of liver metastasis was identified as a risk factor for early death in the nivo+ipi arm vs. 
chemo arm. Further, body weight (low) and alcohol use (never/unknown) were also associated with 
early death among patients treated with nivo+ipi in the exploratory multivariate logistic analyses, 
although results may be influenced by some imbalances in baseline characteristics and the small 
sample size of some subgroups (i.e. never/unknown alcohol use). The highest risk is observed among 
patients with liver metastases, low body weight (<60 kg) and alcohol use value never/unknown. 
Tumour cell PD-L1 was not identified as a predictive risk factor for early death. A warning has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the higher number of early deaths within 4 months and 
that physicians should consider the delayed onset of effect of nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab before initiating treatment in patients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive 
disease.  
The OS subgroup analysis was overall consistent with the primary analysis (all-randomised population) 
for most of the subgroups analysed, except for the subgroup of female patients, where no apparent 
benefit was observed with the combination of nivo+ipi over chemo (HR 1.36; 95% CI: 0.85, 2.20). It 
is acknowledged this is a relatively small subgroup (n=105) and as stated by the MAH, the control arm 
performed better in female patients compared with the overall population (median OS 14.75 months 
vs. 10.71 in the overall population). Nevertheless, CIs barely overlap, suggesting differences observed 
by gender might not be a chance finding. The MAH argued there were some imbalances in prognostic 
factors between both treatment arms, although it is not clear how these imbalances may have 
impacted the results. In the subgroup of female patients with PD-L1≥1%, a more favourable effect 
was observed (HR 0.77; 95%CI: 0.40, 1.49) while clearly not in patients with PD-L1<1% (HR 2.44; 
95% CI: 1.18, 5.04), although these subgroups are even smaller, thus results should be interpreted 
with caution. A similar pattern was observed with pembrolizumab in study KEYNOTE-590, in patients 
with oesophageal cancer3. The KM curves for the subgroup of female patients suggest a lower OS with 
nivo+ipi during all study period. However, taking into account this is a subgroup analysis, with 
important inherent limitations, the relatively small sample size of this subgroup and the fact that a 
biological rationale cannot be confirmed, no conclusions can be drawn.  
With regards to the subgroup analysis by PD-L1 expression, which was in fact one of the stratification 
factors, there is an apparent lack of benefit in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 <1% in OS (HR; 
0.96; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.25) and PFS (HR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.88). Moreover ORR was lower in the 
nivo+ipi arm compared with the chemo arm (20.1% vs. 33.7%). Further, no clear separation of the OS 
KM curves in favour of the experimental arm is observed. Besides, as for the overall population, 
crossing of the KM curves is observed at approximately 9 months. When considering a cut-off of 5%, 
while statistical significance was not reached in OS (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.04) a slight separation 
in KM curves is observed after approximately 9 months (with crossing of KM curves at 6.5 months). 
Bearing in mind the above results, only an indication restricted to patients with tumour cell PD-L1 
expression ≥ 1% could be envisaged. The MAH was requested to further discuss the benefit in the PD-
L1<1% population to justify an ‘all comers’ indication. The MAH argues that the proposed combination 
is a non-chemotherapy containing regimen which may be an option for patients unwilling to receive 
chemo and that the use of nivo + ipi “will be best tailored at the patient level”. This is not considered a 
convincing argumentation. Even if it is agreed that this combination may be an alternative regimen to 
chemotherapy, with a different safety profile which can be considered reasonably manageable, the 
reported efficacy results do not support a positive benefit/risk in the proposed broad indication with 
updated efficacy data confirming the results initially observed in the PD-L1<1% population, see below. 
Further, the increased rate of early deaths in patients treated with nivo+ipi is also of concern, 
particularly in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1<1% in whom the initial lack of control of the

disease together with the reported lower effect do not allow to conclude that this combination is able 
to provide benefit. As a result the indication has been restricted to patients with tumour cell PD-L1 
expression ≥1% (see below). 
Regarding ORR (by BICR), in patients with PD-L1≥1% a higher ORR was reported in the nivo+ipi arm 
vs. chemo (35.4% vs. 19.7%). However, ORR was comparable between treatment arms in the all-
randomised patient population (27.7% nivo+ipi vs. 26.9% chemo). The MAH argues that median DoR 
was slightly longer in the nivo+ipi arm (11.07 months vs. 7.13 months), with a DoR rate at 12 months 
of 48% in the nivo+ipi arm vs. 23% in the chemo arm. It should however be noted that comparing 
median DoR lacks value as this is a non-randomised comparison (i.e. deriving from objective 
responses which are a post-baseline event), while OS and PFS data are available in the context of a 
randomized clinical trial.  
Other exploratory endpoints, such as PFS2/TTST favoured the nivo+ipi arm (HR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62, 
0.88).  
PROs were assessed using the EQ-5D-3L VAS and Utility Index and FACT-E. According to the 
information provided, survey completion was of more than 90% at baseline and more than 80% at 
most subsequent treatment assessments. However, taking into account the open-label design of the 
study and the exploratory nature of this endpoint, no firm conclusions can be drawn in this regard.  
During the procedure updated efficacy data (DBL 04 Oct 2021) with a minimum follow-up of 20 
months were provided. Overall, results were consistent with the primary analysis. An improvement 
was observed with nivo+chemo over chemo in OS (HR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.82) and ORR (35.4% vs. 
19.7%) in patients with tumour cell PD-L1≥1% (i.e. the primary efficacy population). However, no 
benefit was observed in PFS (HR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.34). In the all randomised patients (the 
intended target population) the combination of nivo+ipi resulted in improved OS (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 
0.65, 0.93), but no benefit was observed in PFS, with even a detrimental effect (HR 1.24; 95% CI: 
1.03, 1.50), and ORR was similar between arms (27.7% vs. 26.5%). In patients with PD-L1<1% 
results were also consistent with prior data. Even if the exploratory nature of data reported in this 
subgroup analysis is acknowledged, no apparent benefit was observed with nivo+ipi over chemo in OS 
(HR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.24), a detrimental effect in PFS with the combination was observed (HR 
1.44; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.85) and the ORR was also lower in the nivo+ipi arm (20.1% nivo+ipi vs. 33.1% 
chemo).  
Biomarker analysis 
Additional exploratory biomarker analyses are planned for study CA209648, such as MSI, TMB, genetic 
alterations of select genes an inflammatory gene signature. The MAH is requested to provide results of 
these analyses once available.  
Contribution of the monocomponents 
A justification on the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab has been provided. The rationale for 
the dual checkpoint inhibition is acknowledged and the combination is currently approved in a variety 
of tumour types (i.e. NSCLC, melanoma, RCC, MSI-H/dMMR CRC). The MAH argues that neither 
nivolumab nor ipilimumab alone are expected to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. However, this 
statement is based on efficacy data from studies carried out in a different setting (i.e. later lines of 
OSCC or gastric cancer and even squamous NSCLC) and therefore it is not known whether different 
(better) results may have been reached with nivolumab as monotherapy in treatment naïve patients 
with oesophageal cancer. Nivolumab, as monotherapy, is currently approved in patients with OSCC 
after prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy. In order to further support the 
contribution of ipilimumab to the combination, comparative efficacy data (descriptive) of the 
nivo+chemo arm (which has demonstrated superiority over chemo alone) versus nivo+ipi arm have 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 115/168 
 
 
 
been provided. This descriptive analysis was pre-specified in the SAP. Efficacy data shows no 
differences between nivo+ipi vs. nivo+chemo in OS (HR 1.04; 95%CI: 0.86, 1.26). According to an 
exploratory analysis of piecewise OS HRs, a higher benefit may be expected with nivo+ipi after the 
first 4 months. However, the ORR was higher in the nivo+chemo arm compared with the nivo+ipi 
(47.4% vs. 27.7%), although DoR appears longer with nivo+ipi (8.18 months chemo vs. 11.07 months 
nivo+ipi). Having all considered, the contribution of nivolumab can be considered demonstrated based 
on the results of the nivo+chemo arm over chemo alone. Further, and as mentioned above, OS results 
are consistent between both combinations (i.e. nivo+ipi and nivo+chemo) also supporting that the 
contribution of ipilimumab can be considered established.  
The finally agreed indication is:  
OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. 
YERVOY in combination with nivolumab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. 
As discussed above, based on the available data, a broad indication regardless of PD-L1 expression 
was not considered acceptable and therefore the indication was restricted to patients with tumour cell 
PD-L1 expression ≥1%.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In study CA209648, in adult patients with advanced or metastatic OSCC, treatment with nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab showed a statistically significant clinically relevant OS improvement 
compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. No 
statistically significant differences were observed in PFS, although lack of correlation between PFS and 
OS has been previously observed with immunotherapy. These results can be considered of clinical 
relevance.  
A higher rate of early deaths in the nivo+ipi arm was observed during the first months of treatment. 
These early deaths were observed regardless of tumour cell PD-L1 expression and are compatible with 
lack of control of the disease during the first months. This issue has been observed in other clinical 
trials with immunotherapy. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety assessment for this application is based on All Treated Population (N=936) in study CA209648. 
In particular, safety data from 322 subjects treated with 1L nivo + ipi (nivo 3 mg/kg IV Q2W + ipi 1 
mg/kg IV Q6W) from treatment arm A and 304 subjects treated with chemo from arm C were used to 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022

characterize the safety profile of this combination regimen application in subjects with advanced or 
metastatic OSCC. 
This is a phase 3, global, randomised, open-label study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab 
combined with fluorouracil plus cisplatin vs. fluorouracil plus cisplatin in patients with unresectable 
advanced, recurrent or metastatic previously untreated oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 
Randomization was stratified by tumour cell PD-L1 expression, region, ECOG PS and number of organs 
with metastases. 
Patients in the Nivo + Ipi arm were to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion Q2W and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg as an IV infusion Q6W. Patients in the Chemo arm were to receive fluorouracil 800 
mg/m2/day as a continuous IV infusion on Days 1-5 Q4W and  cisplatin 80 mg/m2 as a 30-120-minute 
IV infusion (or longer if in accordance with local standard of care/local label) on Day 1 Q4W. 
CA209648 study was conducted at 175 sites in 26 countries. The clinical cutoff occurred on 18-Jan-
2021 and DBL occurred on 01-Mar-2021 for the CA209648 Primary CSR. Updated safety data were 
later provided based on a 04-Oct-2021 DBL and a summary of these results are included after the 
initial assessment. 
Patient exposure 
With the DBL of 01-Mar-2021, 936 subjects were treated: 310 with nivo + chemo, 322 with nivo + ipi 
and 304 with chemo. At the time of DBL, study treatment was discontinued in 91.9%, 93.5%, and 
98.7% of the subjects treated with nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi and chemo, respectively. The reasons for 
not continuing on study treatment are displayed in Table 33.

(a) Percentages based on subjects entering period. 
(b) Percentages based on number of randomized subjects 
(c) Percentages based on number of treated subjects 
The primary reason for not continuing in the treatment period was disease progression: 59.4% 
subjects in the nivo + chemo arm, 54% in the nivo + ipi arm and 63.5% in the chemo arm. Study 
drug toxicity was reported as the reason for not continuing in the treatment period for the 10.6% of 
subjects in the nivo + chemo arm, 18.3% in the nivo + ipi arm and 13.2% in the chemo arm. 
Among all treated subjects, the median durations of study therapy were 5.68 (0.1-30.6) months in the 
nivo + chemo arm, 2.79 (0-24.0) months in the nivo + ipi arm, and 3.35 (0-19.0) months in the 
chemo arm. The proportion of subjects with treatment durations >3 months was higher in the chemo 
arm (54.3%) compared with the nivo + ipi arm (47.8%) while this trend is reversed when we look at 
long-term data. The proportions of subjects with durations of therapy of >9 months were numerically 
higher in the nivo + chemo (28.4%) and nivo + ipi (20.5%) arms vs. the chemo arm (9.2%). 
The median (min - max) number of doses of each therapy per arm were: 
•  Nivo + chemo arm (N = 310): 
o  12.0 (1 - 54) doses of nivolumab 
o  5.0 (1 - 24) doses of cisplatin  
o  6.0 (1 - 31) doses of fluorouracil 
•  Nivo + ipi arm (N = 322): 
o  6.0 (1 - 52) doses of nivolumab 
o  3.0 (1 - 18) doses of ipilimumab 
•  Chemo arm: 
o  4.0 (1 - 17) doses of cisplatin (N = 304) 
o  4.0 (1 - 21) doses of fluorouracil (N = 302) 
The proportions of subjects who received ≥90% of the planned relative dose intensity of each therapy 
were as follows by arm: 
•  Nivo + chemo arm (N = 310): 
o  67.4% for nivolumab 
o  55.5% for cisplatin 
o  58.4% for fluorouracil 
•  Nivo + ipi arm (N = 322): 
o  76.1% for nivolumab 
o  87.0% for ipilimumab 
•  Chemo arm: 
o  68.1% for cisplatin (N = 304) 
o  76.2% for fluorouracil (N = 302)

The numbers of doses and cumulative dose per therapy are summarized in Table 2.

Intensity – All Treated Subjects 
Adverse events 
The overall safety summary focuses on the comparison of the nivo + chemo and nivo + ipi arms with 
the chemo arm, which is the most relevant comparison in assessing benefit and risk of nivo + chemo 
and nivo + ipi combination therapies.

Exposure-adjusted Adverse Events Rates 
The exposure-adjusted AE incidence rates (per 100 person-year [P-Y]) were 2516.4 with the nivo + 
chemo arm, 1809.5 with the nivo + ipi arm and 3019.5 with the chemo arm. Per SOC, the higher 
exposure-adjusted AE incidence rates were gastrointestinal disorders (648.8 with the nivo + chemo 
arm, 341.7 with the nivo + ipi arm and 878.7 with the chemo arm), investigations (366.9 with the nivo 
+ chemo arm, 219.9 with the nivo + ipi arm and 377.9 with the chemo arm), metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (307.1 with the nivo + chemo arm, 197.6 with the nivo + ipi arm and 411.6 with the chemo 
arm), and general disorders and administration site conditions (290.8 with the nivo + chemo arm, 
182.9 with the nivo + ipi arm and 357.6 with the chemo arm. Pyrexia was the most frequently 
reported PT for nivo + ipi (67.0/100 P-Y) and nausea was the most frequently reported PT for nivo + 
chemo (204.9/100 P-Y) and chemo treatment (286.4/100 P-Y). 
When the drug-related AE occurrences were exposure-adjusted, drug-related AE incidence rates (per 
100 P-Y) were 636.3 with nivo + ipi vs 1893.5 with chemo treatment. In the nivo + ipi arm, the most 
frequently reported SOC was investigations (125.8/100 P-Y), and the most frequently reported PT was 
rash (41.8/100 P-Y). In the chemo arm, the most frequently reported SOC was gastrointestinal 
disorders (625.2/100 P-Y) with nausea as the most frequently reported PT (266.0/100 P-Y).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
Between the nivo + ipi and chemo arms, the overall proportion of subjects with all-causality and drug-
related SAEs were numerically higher in the nivo + ipi arm vs the chemo arm. The proportions of 
subjects with drug-related SAEs were higher with nivo + ipi vs chemo in the SOCs of Endocrine 
Disorders (6.8% vs 0.3%) and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (6.2% vs 1.6%), 
largely due to immune-related AEs coincident with immunotherapy treatment. 
All-causality any-grade SAEs were reported in 180 (58.1%), 214 (66.5%), and 128 (42.1%) 
treated subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo arms, respectively (Table 38). The most 
frequently reported all-causality SAEs of any grade were: 
•  Nivo + chemo: malignant neoplasm progression (7.7%), pneumonia (7.1%), dysphagia 
(5.8%) 
•  Nivo + ipi: malignant neoplasm progression (12.4%), pneumonia (7.5%), and pneumonitis 
and pyrexia (3.7% each)

oesophageal stenosis (3.3%) 
Drug-related any-grade SAEs were reported in 74 (23.9%), 103 (32.0%), and 49 (16.1%) treated 
subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo arms, respectively (Table 39). The most 
frequently reported drug-related SAEs of any grade were: 
•  Nivo + chemo: acute kidney injury (1.9%); colitis, pneumonia, and stomatitis (1.6% each); 
febrile neutropenia, pneumonitis, vomiting, hyponatraemia, and deceased appetite (1.3% 
each) 
•  Nivo + ipi: pneumonitis (3.7%), hepatic function abnormal (2.5%), adrenal insufficiency 
(2.2%) 
•  Chemo: vomiting (3.0%), and pulmonary embolism, diarrhoea, nausea, hyponatraemia, 
dehydration, atrial fibrillation, and acute kidney injury (1.0% each) 
SAEs due to COVID-19 occurred in 1 subject in the nivo + chemo arm with Grade 5 COVID-19 
pneumonia.

As of the 01-Mar-2021 DBL, the proportions of treated subjects in the nivo + chemo and nivo + ipi 
arms who died were numerically lower than the chemo arm. Disease progression was the most 
common cause of death in all 3 arms (Table 40). 
Note that only events that led to death within 24 hours were to be documented as Grade 5. Events 
leading to death >24 hours after onset were to be reported with the worst grade before death. All 
deaths were required to be reported as an SAE.

syndrome, the causality of this fatal SAE was reported on the AE CRF as not related to 
study therapy by the investigator.  
•  Chemo arm: 4 subjects (1.3%), due to SAEs reported related to chemo of septic shock, sepsis, 
acute kidney injury, and pneumonia in 1 subject each. 
Deaths Attributed to Other Reasons 
The death module of eCRF lists 4 options as primary cause of death: 
1.  Disease 
2.  Study drug toxicity 
3.  Unknown 
4.  Other 
Typically, investigators select option “Other” to indicate a primary cause of death that is commonly an 
outcome of the adverse event due to complications of advanced malignant disease or unrelated 
conditions. 
Deaths attributed to reason reported as “other” occurred in 17 (5.5%), 22 (6.8%), and 8 (2.6%) 
treated subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo arms, respectively. A review of these 
deaths was performed by the MAH which showed some consistency between the three treatment arms. 
Some of them were compatible with complications of advanced esophageal cancer or they were 
considered as fatal outcomes of unrelated adverse events. However, there were 3 subjects in the nivo 
+ ipi arm and 2 subjects in the chemo arm with a reported drug-related AE with a fatal outcome listed 
in this group. The most commonly reported cause of death in this list was pneumonia. 
There were some changes in the causes of death between the 1-Mar-2021 DBL and the 4-Oct-2021 
DBL. In the nivo + ipi arm, two deaths were re-assessed as “due to drug toxicity” in the latest DBL, 
one due to internal bleeding and the other one due to pneumonitis. On the contrary, one death caused 
by acute respiratory syndrome was reassessed and considered not related to treatment within the data 
update. 
Select Adverse Events 
To characterize AEs of special clinical interest that are potentially associated with the use of nivolumab 
and nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, the MAH identified select AEs based on the following 4 
guiding principles: 
•  AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies 
•  AEs that may require immunosuppression (eg, corticosteroids) as part of their management 
•  AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity 
•  AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby 
necessitating the pooling of terms for full characterization 
Based on these guiding principles and taking into account the types of AEs already observed across 
studies of nivolumab monotherapy, select AEs include endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, and rash. Multiple event terms that may describe each of these were 
grouped into endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and skin select AE categories, 
respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 131/168 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were analyzed along with the select AE categories because multiple 
event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling of terms was therefore necessary for full 
characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered 
select AEs. 
The majority of select AEs were Grade 1-2 in all treatment arms, and most select AEs were considered 
drug-related by the investigator. The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories (any 
grade) were as follows in each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: skin (34.2%), endocrine (27.3%), and hepatic (13.0%) 
•  Chemo arm: renal (18.8%), gastrointestinal (15.5%), and hepatic (3.9%) 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs by PT (any grade) were as follows in each 
treatment arm: 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: rash (17.1%), hypothyroidism and pruritis (13.4% each), and diarrhoea 
(9.9%) 
•  Chemo arm: diarrhoea (15.1%), blood creatinine increased (10.5%), and acute kidney injury 
(3.3%) 
The most frequently reported drug-related serious select AEs by PT (any grade) were as follows in 
each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: pneumonitis (3.7%), adrenal insufficiency (2.2%), and hypophysitis (1.9%) 
•  Chemo arm: acute kidney injury and diarrhoea (1.0% each), and renal failure (0.7%) 
At the time of DBL, with the exception of the endocrine category, the majority of subjects’ drug-related 
select AEs had resolved in the nivo + ipi arm (ranging from 62.5% to 100% across categories). The 
median time to resolution of drug-related select AEs ranged from 0.14 to 12.14 weeks in the nivo + ipi 
arm. Some endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone 
replacement therapy (Table 41).

Immune-mediated Adverse Events 
IMAE analyses included diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, renal dysfunction, rash, 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions and endocrine events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 
days of the last dose (ie, with extended follow-up). These analyses were limited to subjects who 
received IMM for treatment of the event, with the exception of endocrine events, which were included 
in the analysis regardless of treatment since these events are often managed without 
immunosuppression. In addition, these events were identified by the investigator as IMAEs with no 
clear alternate etiology, or with an immune-mediated component. 
The total number of subjects with all-causality any grade IMAEs in the nivo + ipi and chemo arms were 
131 (40.7%) and 3 (1.0%), respectively. Overall, the majority of IMAEs were Grade 1-2. The most 
frequently reported IMAEs by category were as follows in each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo + ipi arm (any Grade): hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (15.5%), rash (13.7%), hypophysitis 
(6.5%), hyperthyroidism (5.9%), adrenal insufficiency (5.6%), hepatitis (4.0%), pneumonitis 
(3.7%), and diarrhea/colitis (3.4%)

o  Proportion of subjects with Grade 3-4 IMAEs, by category: hypophysitis (3.1%); rash 
(2.5%); hepatitis (2.8%); pneumonitis and adrenal insufficiency (2.2% each); 
diarrhea/colitis (1.2%); nephritis/renal dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and 
hyperthyroidism (0.6% each)  
•  Chemo arm (any Grade): rash (0.7%) 
o  Proportion of subjects with Grade 3-4 IMAEs, by category: rash (0.3%) 
Across IMAE categories, the majority of events were manageable using established management 
algorithms, with resolution occurring when IMMs (mostly systemic corticosteroids) were administered 
(Table 42). Some subjects’ endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need 
for hormone replacement therapy. 
Re-challenge information was also summarized for subjects who continued to receive nivo + ipi 
treatment after the onset of an IMAE. Subjects who were rechallenged were subjects with study 
therapy re-initiated on or after symptom improvement/resolution. A positive re-challenge/recurrence 
was defined as any occurrence of new event(s) or worsening of any severity grade IMAE on or after 
study therapy re-initiation.

Other Events of Special Interest 
OESIs do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as IMAEs but may require immunosuppression as part of their 
management. 
Among all treated subjects, OESIs (regardless of causality or IMM treatment, with extended follow-up) 
were infrequent, and most events resolved by the time of DBL (Table 43): 
•  Nivo + chemo arm: OESIs were reported in 4 subjects (6 events), of which 4 events resolved. 
2 of these events were resolved with IMMs. 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: OESIs were reported in 14 subjects (23 events), of which 19 events resolved. 
11 of these events were resolved with IMMs. 
•  Chemo arm: no OESIs were reported.

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory abnormalities (hematology, liver tests, kidney function tests, and electrolytes) were 
primarily Grade 1-2 in severity and reflected the known laboratory abnormalities associated with the 
different treatment regimens. 
Laboratory test results for all treated subjects are summarized by worst CTC Grade (Grade 1-4 and 
Grade 3-4) for laboratory parameters that worsened relative to baseline in Table 44 (30-day follow-up, 
SI units):

All Treated Subjects 
Hematology 
Abnormalities in hematology test reported during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities that worsened from 
baseline reported in ≥5% of subjects were as follows: 
•  Nivo + chemo arm: decreased lymphocytes (23.3%), decreased hemoglobin (21.4%), 
decreased absolute neutrophil count (17.7%), and decreased leukocytes (10.8%) 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: decreased lymphocytes (12.7%), and decreased hemoglobin (6.5%) 
•  Chemo arm: decreased hemoglobin (13.8%), decreased absolute neutrophil count (13.5%), 
decreased lymphocytes (8.2%), and decreased leukocytes (5.3%)

Serum Chemistry 
Liver Tests 
During the treatment period, abnormalities (increases) in hepatic parameters (alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and total bilirubin) were 
primarily Grade 1-2 in each treatment arm. Grade 3-4 hepatic abnormalities that worsened from 
baseline occurred at higher frequencies in the nivo + ipi arm, though the overall frequencies were 
<6% of subjects across the treatment arms: 
•  Nivo + chemo arm: ALP (1.3%), AST (3.3%), ALT (2.3%), total bilirubin (0.3%) 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: ALP (3.3%), AST (5.6%), ALT (5.9%), total bilirubin (0.7%) 
•  Chemo arm: AST (1.4%), ALT (0.7%) 
Concurrent ALT or AST >3×ULN with total bilirubin >2×ULN within 1 day and within 30 days, based on 
laboratory results reported after the first dose and within 30 days of last dose of study therapy, was 
reported in 2/305 (0.7%), 3/306 (1.0%), and 0 subjects with test results in the nivo + chemo, nivo + 
ipi, and chemo arms, respectively (Table 45). 
Table 45. On-Treatment Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Liver Tests (SI Units) – All 
Treated Subjects 
Kidney Function Tests 
Most subjects with at least 1 on-treatment measurement had normal creatinine values during the 
treatment reporting period. The abnormalities in creatinine (increases from baseline) were primarily 
reported as Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3-4 creatinine (increased) (SI units) reported in 7 (2.3%), 2 
(0.7%), and 2 (0.7%) subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo arms, respectively. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
The majority of all treated subjects in each treatment arm had normal TSH levels at baseline and 
throughout the treatment period. TSH (SI units) increases (>ULN) from baseline (≤ULN) were reported 
in 60 (20.5%), 61 (22.8%), and 9 (7.6%) of subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo 
treatment arms, respectively (Table 46). Decreases (<LLN) from baseline (≤LLN) were reported in 35

(12.0%), 61 (22.8%), and 12 (10.2%) of subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + ipi, and chemo 
treatment arms, respectively. 
Table 46. Summary of Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Thyroid Tests (SI Units) - All 
Treated Subjects with at Least One On-Treatment TSH Measurement 
Electrolytes 
Most subjects had normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period. Abnormalities in 
electrolytes during treatment were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in severity. The following Grade 3-4 
abnormalities (SI) in electrolytes from baseline were reported in ≥5% of treated subjects with on-
treatment laboratory results: 
•  Nivo + chemo arm: hyponatremia (14.8%) and hypokalemia (9.5%) 
•  Nivo + ipi arm: hyponatremia (11.8%) and hypokalemia (5.2%) 
•  Chemo arm: hyponatremia (8.9%) and hypokalemia (6.0%) 
Safety in special populations 
In the nivo + ipi vs chemo arms, frequencies of subjects with all-causality (Table 47) and drug-related 
AEs (Table 48) in the subgroups of sex, age category, race, and region were comparable overall to the 
frequencies of subjects with AE reported for the overall study populations by arm. 
Sex 
Frequencies of all-causality AEs and drug-related AEs overall were comparable by sex in each 
treatment arm, with the exception of a numerically higher frequency of all-causality AEs reported for 
females (69.1%) vs males (57.7%) in the nivo + ipi arm. 
Race 
Frequencies of subjects with all-causality AEs and drug-related AEs were comparable between Asians 
and non-Asians in each treatment arm. 
Age Category 
Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs were comparable by age category (< 65, ≥65 - <75, 
≥75 - <85, ≥65, ≥75, and ≥85 years) within each treatment arm, with the exception of numerically 
higher proportions of chemo-treated subjects with all-causality and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs, 
respectively, in the ≥65 (61.1% and 44.3%) vs <65 (47.7% and 27.1%) categories. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 139/168 
 
 
 
 
Interpretation of safety data from the ≥75 and ≥85 age categories is limited by small sample sizes. 
The frequencies of AEs for subgroups of age <65 (N=164), 65 to 74 (N=117), and 75 to 84 years 
(N=26) were similar to the frequencies reported for the overall population (N=310), with these 
exceptions: 
• 
The 75-84 years subgroup had higher frequency of SAEs (65.4%), fatal events (26.9%), 
hospitalization/prolongation (61.5%), accident and injuries (19.2%), and cardiac disorders 
(11.5%) compared to the overall population (58.1%, 11.9%, 54.8%, 9.0%, and 5.2%, 
respectively), and lower frequency of psychiatric disorders (11.5%) compared to overall 
population (20.3%). 
Region 
Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs were numerically lower among subjects 
from Rest of Asia compared to East Asia and Rest of World within treatment arms: 
• 
• 
Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, in nivo +chemo arm: 
Rest of Asia (N = 42; 54.8% and 33.3%), East Asia (N = 178; 74.2% and 49.4%), and Rest of 
World (N = 90; 67.8% and 50.0%) 
Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs, respectively, in nivo +ipi arm: 
Rest of Asia (N = 44; 50.0% and 27.3%), East Asia (N = 184; 60.9% and 30.4%), and Rest of 
World (N = 94; 61.7% and 36.2%)

Immunogenicity 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab 
Of the 281 nivolumab ADA-evaluable subjects in the nivo + ipi arm, 19 (6.8%) subjects were 
nivolumab ADA positive at baseline, and 68 (24.2%) subjects were nivolumab ADA positive after start 
of treatment (Table 49). 
•  1 (0.4%) subject was considered persistent positive, and 6 (2.1%) subjects were neutralizing 
ADA positive. 
• 
• 
Two subjects were positive for nivolumab ADA at baseline, but the titers of post-baseline ADA 
and neutralizing ADA samples did not exceed ≥ 4-fold titer increase from baseline. Thus, both 
subjects were not qualified for the definition of ADA-positive or NAb-positive. 
The highest nivolumab ADA titer values observed were 256 and 512, which occurred in 1 
subject each. All other titers were low, ranging from 1 to 64. 
Of the 282 ipilimumab ADA-evaluable subjects in the nivo + ipi arm, 6 (2.1%) subjects were 
ipilimumab ADA-positive at baseline and 17 (6.0%) subjects were ipilimumab ADA-positive after the 
start of treatment (Table 49). 
•  1 (0.4%) subject was considered persistent positive for ipilimumab ADA only, and 1 (0.4%) 
subject was neutralizing ADA positive for ipilimumab ADA only. 
• 
Ipilimumab ADA titers were low, ranging from 1 to 64.

Effect of Immunogenicity on Efficacy 
Based on assessment of the presence of ADAs and NAbs vs BOR per BICR, some subjects positive for 
nivolumab and/or ipilimumab ADAs and NAbs continued treatment with clinical benefit, and there was 
no apparent trend showing an effect of positive ADA or NAbs on the efficacy of nivo + ipi. 
A BOR of CR or PR per BICR was reported in 24 out of 68 nivolumab ADA-positive subjects and in 7 out 
of 17 ipilimumab ADA-positive subjects. The ADA titers among all ADA-positive subjects ranged from 1 
to 512 for nivolumab and 1 to 64 for ipilimumab. Though these results are based on small sample sizes 
and should be interpreted with caution, these results are consistent with the ORR observed for all 
randomized subjects in the nivo + ipi arm (27.7%), which included subjects negative for ADA. 
Overall, the incidences of nivolumab and ipilimumab NAbs were low. 
•  Of the 6 subjects with nivolumab NAbs (Table 49): 
o  BORs per BICR were SD for 4 subjects (66.7%) and PD for 2 subjects (33.3%). There 
were no subjects with CR or PR per BICR. 
o  The nivolumab ADA titers in these subjects ranged from 1 to 256. 
• 
For the 1 subject in the nivo + ipi arm with ipilimumab NAbs, BOR per BICR was SD. 
o  The ipilimumab ADA titers in this subject ranged from 4 to 64. 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety 
Overall, an effect of ADA on the safety of nivo + ipi treatment was not observed (Table 50).  
Among the nivo + ipi-treated subjects evaluable for nivolumab ADA, the proportions of subjects with 
hypersensitivity/infusion-related reaction select AEs was 4/68 (5.9%) subjects in the nivolumab ADA-

positive subgroup vs 8/213 (3.8%) subjects in the nivolumab ADA-negative subgroup. However, 
though the sample size of the ADA-positive group limits interpretation, all of these 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were Grade 1 or 2, and all events resolved. 
Among the nivo + ipi-treated subjects evaluable for ipilimumab ADA, the proportion of subjects with 
hypersensitivity/infusion-related reaction select AEs was higher in the ipilimumab ADA positive 
subgroup (2/17 subjects, 11.8%) vs ipilimumab ADA-negative subgroup (10/265 subjects, 3.8%) 
(Table 50). However, though the sample size of the ADA-positive group limits interpretation, all of 
these hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were Grade 1 or 2, and all events resolved.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were defined as events when 1 or more study drugs of 
a multidrug regimen were discontinued, even if the subject remained on treatment or in follow-up. 
Between the nivo + ipi and chemo arms, the overall proportions of subjects were comparable for all-
causality AEs leading to discontinuation (25.2% vs 25.3%) and for drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation (17.7% vs 19.4%). 
All-causality any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation of any component of study therapy were 
reported in 126 (40.6%), 81 (25.2%), and 77 (25.3%) treated subjects in the nivo + chemo, nivo + 
ipi, and chemo arms, respectively (Table 51). The most frequently reported all-causality AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study therapy of any grade were:

Safety to Support the Product Information (PI) 
Based on The EU guidance document “A guideline on summary of product characteristics (SmPC) 
September 2009” and EMA guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5), the following methodology was used to generate the adverse reactions 
with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W for Section 4.8 of the OPDIVO SmPC and 
Section 4.8 of the YERVOY SmPC. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Integrate all-causality AEs data from CA209648 and CA209743 (1L unresectable malignant 
pleural mesothelioma) for the intended dose and regimen of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W. 
Programmatically remap MedDRA PTs representing the same or similar clinical conditions for 
the integrated AE data and generate summary tables. 
Identify clinically relevant events based on BMS medical review of the all-causality re-mapped 
AE summary table. 
Present resulting clinically relevant re-mapped events by SOC and all-causality frequency in 
the final adverse drug reaction (ADR) table. 
To calculate the frequencies of laboratory ADR, BMS used the laboratory abnormality change 
from baseline tables. 
As explained above, for labeling purposes, some MedDRA PTs were remapped for the purposes of 
generating summary tables to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC pooling PTs representing the same or 
similar clinical conditions. For the proposed nivolumab and ipilimumab SmPC, selection of specific ADRs 
(Section 4.8 of the nivolumab and ipilimumab SmPC) is based on clinical relevance as determined by 
the BMS medical reviewer.  
A review of all-causality AEs was conducted for CA209648 and the integrated safety data from 
CA209648 and CA209743 to ensure that the appropriate MedDRA PTs are represented in the proposed 
Table of ADRs. The list of PTs included in the proposed Table of ADRs in Section 4.8 of the SmPC for 
both nivolumab and ipilimumab reflects the ADRs that were observed with nivo + ipi in CA209648 and 
its aim is to provide concise, relevant information, enabling HCPs to make appropriate decisions 
regarding patient treatment and management based on information regarding the frequency and 
nature of the ADRs that may occur in patients in clinical practice. In line with the above mentioned 
guidelines, frequency of ADR is presented based on all-causality AEs. To calculate the frequencies of 
laboratory ADR, BMS used the laboratory abnormality change from baseline tables for the pooled 
subjects from CA209648 + CA209743 (with 30 days of follow-up). The denominator used to compute 
frequency is the number of subjects for whom laboratory data were available, as opposed to all treated 
subjects. Hence, there is variability in the denominator for each individual laboratory abnormality and 
the respective reported frequency. Also note: CA209648 scheduled safety assessment did not include 
the collection of amylase and lipase data; hence, the total amylase and total lipase in Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC under nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in the 3rd column of 
Table 7 remain unchanged and are based only on data from CA209743 (MPM).

OPDIVO SmPC 
The presentation of ADRs in Section 4.8 of the current approved OPDIVO SmPC displays 3 columns in 
Table 7, one for nivolumab 1 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in melanoma, one for 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and dMMR 
or MSI-H colorectal cancer (CRC), and one for nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).  
With the current application, the 3rd column in the ADR table is updated with pooled data from 1L 
treatment of OSCC (n=322 of treated patients from CA209648) and 1L treatment of MPM (n=300 of 
treated patients from CA209743) for nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q6W. The intended dose regimen and/or schedule of administration for OSCC was the same as the 
approved regimen for MPM. The patient population with tumour cell PD L1 ≥1% from CA209648 
presented with a similar safety profile, and a qualitative statement was added in Section 4.8 of the 
OPDIVO SmPC. 
YERVOY SmPC 
The presentation of ADRs in Section 4.8 of the current approved YERVOY SmPC displays 3 columns in 
Table 5, one for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in melanoma, one for 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in RCC and dMMR or MSI-H CRC, and one 
for ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in MPM.  
With the current application, the 3rd column in the ADR table is updated with pooled data from 1L 
treatment of OSCC (n=322 of treated patients from CA209648) and 1L treatment of MPM (n=300 of 
treated patients from CA209743) for ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
Q2W. The intended dose regimen and/or schedule of administration for OSCC was the same as the 
approved regimen for MPM. The patient population with tumor cell PD L1 ≥ 1% from CA209648 
presented with a similar safety profile, and a qualitative statement was added in the Section 4.8 of the 
YERVOY SmPC. 
OPDIVO and YERVOY Package Leaflets (PL) 
In line with the approach for the SmPC, PL Sections 4 is updated. With this application, the list of side 
effects reported in ‘clinical trials with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab’ is updated with 
highest frequency, as needed. 
Presentation of Clinically Relevant Adverse Reactions 
Text on the proposed dosage and administration of nivolumab (OPDIVO) in combination with 
ipilimumab (YERVOY) is provided in Section 4.2 of the nivolumab and ipilimumab SmPCs. Detailed 
guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse reactions are described in Sections 4.4 of 
the nivolumab and ipilimumab SmPCs. 
In this application, no amendments or changes in the management of adverse reactions are proposed 
based on the data from CA209648 and the integrated safety data. 
Safety Results of Nivolumab in Combination with Ipilimumab in First-Line OSCC (CA209648) 
and Pooled Studies across Tumour Types 
Safety data for 1L treatment of OSCC with nivo + ipi from CA209648 were pooled with safety data for 
1L treatment of MPM with Nivo + ipi from CA209743. The intended dose regimen and/or schedule of 
administration for OSCC was the same as the approved regimen for MPM: nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W in 
combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W.

A summary of re-mapped all-causality, and drug-related AEs (within 30 days of the last dose) for nivo 
+ ipi arm in CA209648 (n=322) is shown side-by-side with the integrated safety data from CA209743 
(n=300), and pooled analysis of the nivo + ipi arm from CA209648 and CA209743 (n=622) in Table 54 
and Table 55, respectively. Overall, the types of AEs reported in CA209648 were consistent with 
CA209743 and the pooled analysis of CA209648 and CA209743 for nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab. 
The frequencies of any grade, all-causality, and drug-related AEs were comparable or lower in nivo + 
ipi treated subjects in CA209648 when compared with the pooled analysis except the following 
differences: 
• 
• 
The frequencies of any grade all-causality AEs were higher in nivo + ipi treated subjects in 
CA209648 vs the pooled for dysphagia (11.8% vs 7.2%), anaemia (23.0% vs 19.1%), 
pneumonia (14.3% vs 10.5%), transaminase increased (15.2% vs 12.2%), and weight 
decreased (12.1% vs 8.8%) (Table 54). 
The frequencies of drug-related AEs were higher in nivo + ipi treated subjects in CA209648 vs 
the pooled for, transaminases increased (10.9% vs 8.8%) and stomatitis (5.9% vs 4.0%) 
(Table 55).

Additional safety data for nivo+ipi treated subjects in CA209648 vs pooled analysis of all nivo + ipi 
treated subjects in CA209648 and CA209743 (N=622) have been generated to support the SmPC. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the phase 3 CA209648 study supporting this application, 936 subjects were treated with nivo + 
chemo (N=310), nivo + ipi (N=322) or chemo (N=304). Patients in the nivo + ipi arm were to receive 
nivolumab 240 mg as a 30-min IV infusion Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion 
Q6W. Patients in the chemo arm received fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day, as a continuous IV infusion on 
Days 1-5 Q4W, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 as a 30-120-minute IV infusion on Day 1 Q4W. At the time of 
the DBL (1-Mar-2021), with a minimum follow-up of 12.9 months, a total of 886 subjects (94.7%) had 
discontinued treatment, 301 (93.5%) from the nivo + ipi arm and 300 (98.7%) from the 
chemotherapy treatment arm. The main reason for not continuing in the treatment period was disease 
progression in all cases but, for 59 (18.3%) subjects from the nivo + ipi arm and 40 (13.2%) from the 
chemotherapy arm, the reason for not continuing in the treatment period was reported as study drug 
toxicity. The median duration of study therapy was 2.79 (0 -24.0) months in the nivo + ipi arm and 
3.35 (0-19.0) months in the chemo arm. The median number of treatment doses received by subjects 
in the nivo + ipi arm was 6 (1-52) for nivolumab and 3 (1-18) for ipilimumab while, in the 
chemotherapy arm, the median number of doses was 4 for each component (1-17 cisplatin, 1-21 
fluorouracil), partly due to higher rate of disease progression (54% vs. 63.5%) reported by subjects 
from the chemo arm. The proportion of patients who received ≥90% of the planned relative dose 
intensity was comparable between both treatment groups but these figures are difficult to be 
interpreted, as in the nivo + ipi arm relative dose intensity accounts for dose delays (no dose 
reductions are allowed) and in the chemo arm, variations from the planned relative dose intensity 
account for dose reductions and cycle delays. Updated safety data was later provided based on a 04-
Oct-2021 DBL and a summary of these results has been included after the initial assessment. The 
overall safety profile remained consistent with that previously reported in the primary analysis. 
The most frequently reported AEs (>20%) in the nivo + ipi arm were nausea and pyrexia (22.4% 
each), diarrhoea and anaemia (22.0% each), rash (21.7%), constipation (20.5%) and neoplasms 
(20.2%) while; in the chemo arm, they were nausea (55.9%), decreased appetite (49.7%), 
constipation (43.1%), anaemia (31.9%), stomatitis (24.0%), and hiccups (20.7%). Grade 3-4 AEs 
were reported by 59.6% of subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 54.3% in the chemo arm. The most 
common (>5%) Grade 3-4 AEs were pneumonia (6.8%), malignant neoplasm progression (6.5%), 
anaemia (6.2%), and dysphagia (5.3%) in the nivo + ipi arm and anaemia (9.9%), neutrophil count 
decreased (8.6%), and decreased appetite (5.9%) in the chemo arm. Regarding treatment-related 
AEs, any-grade treatment-related AEs were reported by the 79.5% of subjects in the nivo + ipi arm 
Assessment report

and 90.5% subjects in the chemo arm, being the most commonly reported: rash (17.1%), and pruritus 
and hypothyroidism (13.4% each) in the nivo + ipi arm and nausea (52.0%), decreased appetite 
(42.8%), and stomatitis (23.4%) in the chemo arm. When considering only Grade 3-4 AEs, these were 
reported in the 31.7% of subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and the 35.5% subjects from the chemo arm, 
being the most common: hyponatraemia (2.5%); and rash, adrenal insufficiency, pneumonitis, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, and hepatic function abnormal (2.2% each) in the nivo + ipi arm, and 
neutrophil count decreased (7.9%), anaemia (5.6%), and fatigue (3.6%) in the chemo arm.  
The frequencies of SAEs were higher in the nivo + ipi arm compared with the chemo arm (66.5% vs. 
42.1%). The most frequently reported were malignant neoplasm progression (12.4%), pneumonia 
(7.5%), and pneumonitis and pyrexia (3.7% each) in the nivo + ipi arm; and malignant neoplasm 
progression (4.9%), dysphagia and pneumonia (3.6% each), oesophageal stenosis (3.3%) in the 
chemo treatment arm. Focusing on drug-related SAEs, they were reported by 32% subjects in the nivo 
+ ipi arm and 16.1% in the chemo arm, being the most common SAEs pneumonitis (3.7%), hepatic 
function abnormal (2.5%), adrenal insufficiency (2.2%) in the nivo + ipi arm and vomiting (3.0%), 
and pulmonary embolism, diarrhoea, nausea, hyponatraemia, dehydration, atrial fibrillation, and acute 
kidney injury (1.0% each) in the chemo treatment arm. 
Up to the data cut-off (DCO), the number of patients who died was numerically lower in the nivo + ipi 
arm compared with the chemo arm (66.8% vs. 73.7%). The primary reason for death was mainly 
disease progression. Deaths attributable to study drug toxicity were 5 (1.6%) in the nivo + ipi arm and 
4 (1.3%) in the chemo treatment arm. The SAEs reported as primary reason for death in the nivo + ipi 
arm were: pneumonitis (2 subjects), interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism and acute 
respiratory syndrome. Up to the latest DBL (4 Oct 2021), 72.7% subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 
79.6% subjects in the chemo arm had died. The main reasons of death were generally consistent with 
the previous ones although there were two deaths reassessed as drug toxicity in the nivo + ipi arm.   
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for nivolumab and ipilimumab are classified into Select 
Adverse Events, immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs) and other events of special interest (OESIs). The most 
frequently reported drug-related select AE categories were skin (34.2%), endocrine (27.3%) and 
hepatic (13.0%) in the nivo + ipi arm, and renal (18.8%), gastrointestinal (15.5%), and hepatic 
(3.9%) in the chemo arm. By PT, the most common select AEs were rash (17.1%), hypothyroidism 
and pruritus (13.4% each), and diarrhoea (9.9%), and diarrhoea (15.1%), blood creatinine increased 
(10.5%), and acute kidney injury (3.3%) in the chemotherapy treatment arm. As seen with other 
nivolumab therapeutic indications, endocrine AEs tend to have the lowest rate resolved events (28.6% 
of subjects), followed by renal (62.5%) and pulmonary (65.4%) in the nivo + ipi treatment arm. 
Regarding IMAEs, analyses included endocrine events in addition to all events which required 
immunosuppressive therapy for their management. As expected, incidence of IMAEs was higher in the 
nivo + ipi arm compared with the chemo arm where rash (0.7%) was the only reported event of this 
type. In the nivo + ipi arm, 40.7% of subjects reported any IMAE being the most common: 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (15.5%), rash (13.7%), hypophysitis (6.5%), hyperthyroidism (5.9%), 
adrenal insufficiency (5.6%), hepatitis (4.0%), pneumonitis (3.7%), and diarrhoea/colitis (3.4%). The 
proportion of subjects who reported Grade 3-4 IMAEs (by category) was hypophysitis (3.1%), rash 
(2.5%), hepatitis (2.8%), pneumonitis and adrenal insufficiency (2.2% each), diarrhoea/colitis (1.2%), 
nephritis/renal dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism (0.6% each). OESIs, events that 
do not fulfil all criteria to be considered IMAEs but which may require immunosuppression for their 
management, were reported by 14 subjects from the nivo + ipi group. These events were Grade 2-4 
pancreatitis, Grade 1 myocarditis, Grade 1-4 uveitis, Grade 2-4 encephalitis and Grade 1-2 myositis. 
All of them were considered resolved except for a Grade 1 event of myocarditis, one Grade 2 event of 
uveitis and Grade 1 myositis.

Focusing on laboratory abnormalities (up to 30 days after last treatment dose), reported increases in 
hepatic parameters were higher in the nivo + ipi arm compared with the chemo arm, while this trend 
was not observed regarding hematology values whose alterations are generally attributed to 
chemotherapy. Concurrent ALT or AST >3×ULN with total bilirubin >2×ULN after the first dose and 
within 30 days of last dose of study therapy was reported in 3/306 (1%) in the nivo + ipi arm and 0 
subjects, with test results, in the chemo arm. The most common thyroid function test abnormality was 
TSH increase (>ULN) which was reported by the 22.8% and the 7.6% of subjects from the nivo + ipi 
arm and the chemo arm, respectively. Electrolytes alterations were also slightly higher in the nivo + ipi 
arm compared with the chemo arm, although differences were not as remarkable as those observed 
for the third treatment arm (nivo + chemo). Discussion about the relation between these abnormalities 
and the high rate of diarrhoea and colitis reported with nivolumab has been included in previous 
submissions and, although very limited number of these results have clinical relevance, their relation 
cannot be excluded. Vital signs observations were submitted by individual patient listings in the initial 
application. Upon request, the MAH performed a manual review of PTs that could be linked to vital 
sign-related AEs. Overall, reported incidences of these events were comparable between both 
treatment arms with no relevant differences. 
Considering safety in special populations, reported AEs were, in general, comparable between 
treatment arms. Overall, all-causality AEs and drug-related AEs (by SOC and PT) presented higher 
incidences in females but a thorough comparison between male and female subjects for both 
treatment arms did not show any particular trend. Frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs 
were also comparable between different age groups. Data for ≥75 is limited due to the small sample 
size (24 subjects in each arm) and no data is available for ≥85. 
The proportion of subjects with drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation was similar in the nivo + ipi 
arm vs. the chemo arm (17.7% vs. 19.4%). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study therapy were pneumonitis (2.5%), and adrenal insufficiency and hepatic 
function abnormal (1.6% each) in the nivo + ipi arm; and blood creatinine increased (3.6%), 
malignant neoplasm progression and renal impairment (2.3% each), peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(2.0%), and creatinine renal clearance decreased (1.3%) in the chemo arm. Drug-related Grade 3-4 
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 41 (12.7%) subjects from the nivo + ipi arm and 14 
(4.6%) subjects in the chemo treatment arm. 
Safety data analyses have also been submitted for the All Treated Subjects with Tumour Cell PD-L1 
≥1% population. Overall, no major differences were reported between these subjects and the All 
Treated population. 
Regarding data to support safety information included in section 4.8 of the PI, pooling of safety results 
from studies CA209648 (current application) and CA209743 (Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma 
therapeutic indication) has been proposed. This approach seems reasonable due to the fact that both 
studies were performed using the same posology (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q6W). Detailed justification for the proposed information to be included in the PI has been submitted, 
comparing frequencies of AEs between both studies and the pooled analysis using the already 
explained re-mapping methodology. When comparing safety results from study CA209648 vs. the 
pooled dataset, some differences were identified: the incidences of any grade all-causality AEs were 
higher in nivo + ipi treated subjects in CA209648 for dysphagia (11.8% vs 7.2%), anaemia (23.0% vs 
19.1%), pneumonia (14.3% vs 10.5%), transaminase increased (15.2% vs 12.2%), and weight 
decreased (12.1% vs 8.8%). Also, drug-related AEs were higher in nivo + ipi treated subjects in 
CA209648 vs the pooled for, transaminases increased (10.9% vs 8.8%) and stomatitis (5.9% vs 
4.0%). These differences are not considered clinically relevant and the pooling strategy is endorsed.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for the 1L treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic OSCC has been characterised based on the results 
from study CA209648, by comparison with subjects who received standard chemotherapy. 
Subjects treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab reported less all-causality and drug-related AEs but 
considerably higher rates of SAEs, including drug-related SAEs. There was also high incidence of 
discontinuations due to drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs. Deaths attributable to treatment were comparable 
between arms. As expected, select AEs, IMAEs and OESIs were frequently reported with this 
combination, especially regarding endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary and skin categories. Early detention 
and management of these toxicities continue to be crucial for patients receiving this combination 
treatment. 
For the purpose of including identified ADRs in the PI, safety results from study CA209648 have been 
pooled with those from study CA209743 (MPM), as both studies used the same posology. 
Overall, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in this OSCC setting presents considerable 
toxicity that, compared with standard chemotherapy, seems to be manageable but especial attention 
must be drawn to IMAEs and their established clinical management and follow-up.

Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the WSA and has been found <acceptable> <unacceptable> for the 
following reasons: 
The inclusion of the new proposed indication for Opdivo (i.e. in combination with ipilimumab for the 
first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma, does not have a relevant impact on the PIL and therefore it is agreed with 
the MAH that there is no need to conduct additional consultation with target patients groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The MAH is seeking an extension of the indication for Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with Yervoy 
(ipilimumab) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or 
metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Oesophageal cancer (OC) is the eighth-most common cancer and the sixth-most common cause of 
death worldwide, with an estimated 604,100 new cases (3.1% of all cancers) and 544,076 cancer 
deaths (5.5% of all cancer deaths)4. In the UE, oesophageal cancer is the 19th most common cancer, 
although variability between countries is high. There are two distinct histologic types of OC: squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC). Globally, OSCC is the most common histological 
subtype, however while the incidence of OSCC has decreased in many regions, a marked increase in 
the incidence of OAC has been observed in Europe, North America, and Australia during the past four 
decades5. 
The main risk factors for SCC are smoking and alcohol consumption. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients with advanced and recurrent OC and a good performance status (PS) palliative 
chemotherapy is commonly used, particularly for patients with AC. In SCC, the value of palliative 
chemotherapy is less proved and best supportive care (BSC) or palliative monotherapy can also be 
considered6. Among the regimens used in the first-line setting, a combination of fluoropyrimidine 
(either 5-FU or capecitabine) and cisplatin or oxaliplatin are the preferred recommended regimens7. 
Use of oxaliplatin is also preferred over cisplatin due to lower toxicity. 
Recent findings from the KEYNOTE 590 study showed that immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab 
in combination with chemotherapy in the first line (1L) setting was superior to chemotherapy for 
overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced/unresectable 
or metastatic OAC, OSCC (73% of the study population), or GEJ adenocarcinoma. Based on these

study findings, pembrolizumab (in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy) has been approved in the EU for the 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced 
unresectable or metastatic oesophageal carcinoma (including OSCC) whose tumours express PD
L1 
with a CPS ≥10 (Keytruda II/97). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
‑
The evidence in support of the claimed indication is based on results from the study CA209648. The 
study CA209648 is a Phase 3, randomised, multicentre, open-label study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
or  nivolumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (fluorouracil  plus  cisplatin)  versus  chemotherapy 
(fluorouracil plus cisplatin) in subjects with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic previously 
untreated OSCC. 
The primary endpoints were OS and PFS, as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 criteria, in patients with 
PD-L1≥1%. Secondary endpoints included OS and PFS in all randomised subjects and ORR (both in PD-
L1≥1% and the overall population, by BICR). A hierarchical testing strategy was used for the primary 
and secondary endpoints. 
A total of 970 patients were randomised (325 in the nivo+ipi arm, 321 in the nivo+chemo arm and 324 
in the chemo arm). Results presented below are based on the comparison of nivo+ipi vs. chemo at the 
time of the primary analysis (DBL: 1 March 2021).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoints (PD-L1≥1%) (n=315) 
OS results (event rate 67.1% nivo+ipi vs. 77.1% chemo) showed a statistically significant 
improvement in favour of the nivo+ipi arm over chemo arm (HR 0.64; 98.6% CI: 0.46, 0.90). Median 
OS was of 13.70 (95% CI: 11.24, 17.02) months in the nivo+ipi group and 9.07 (95% CI: 7.69, 9.95) 
months in the chemo group. 
Regarding PFS (event rate 77.8% nivo+ipi vs. 63.7% chemo) no statistically significant differences 
were observed between treatment arms (HR 1.02; 98.5% CI: 0.73, 1.43). Median PFS was 4.04 (95% 
CI: 2.40, 4.93) months and 4.44 (95% CI: 2.89, 5.82) months, in the nivo+ipi and chemo groups, 
respectively. 
Secondary endpoints 
OS in the all-randomised patients (event rate of 66.5% in the nivo+ipi arm and 71.6% in the 
chemo arm), showed a statistically significant benefit of nivo+ipi over chemo (HR 0.78; 98.2% CI: 
0.62, 0.98). Median OS was of 12.75 (95% CI: 11.27, 15.47) months and 10.71 (95% CI: 9.40, 
11.93) months in the experimental and control arm, respectively.  
Results in terms of PFS (by BICR) in the all-randomised patients did not reach statistical 
significance (HR 1.26; 98.5% CI: NA, NA). Median PFS was 2.92 (95%CI: 2.66, 4.17) months in the 
nivo+ipi arm versus 5.59 (95% CI: 4.27, 5.88) months in the chemo arm. 
The ORR (by BICR) was higher in the nivo+ipi arm compared with the chemo arm in patients with PD-
L1≥1% (35.4% vs. 19.7%) while no differences were observed in the all-randomised patients (27.7% 
vs. 26.9%). 
Updated efficacy data were provided during the procedure with a DBL of 04 Oct 2021 and a minimum 
follow-up of 20 months. Results were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/155438/2022  
Page 164/168 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The combination of nivo+ipi demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in the all-
randomised patient population. However, this effect appears to be driven mostly by patients with 
tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%. In patients with PD-L1<1%, the benefit of the combination of 
nivo+ipi over chemotherapy is not justified. As a result the indication was restricted to patients with 
tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%. 
Further, there was a higher rate of early deaths in the nivo+ipi arm compared with the chemo arm, 
being disease progression the main cause of these deaths. The delay in the onset of action of 
immunotherapy along with some prognostic factors appear the most plausible explanation. This issue 
has been observed in previous clinical trials with immunotherapy. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In study CA209648, 98.1% of subjects in the nivo + ipi arm and 99% in the chemo arm reported any 
AEs. The most common AEs in the nivo + ipi arm were nausea and pyrexia (22.4% each), diarrhoea and 
anaemia  (22.0%  each),  rash  (21.7%),  constipation  (20.5%)  and neoplasms  (20.2%).  Grade  3-4  AEs 
were reported by 59.6% subjects in the nivo + ipi arm compared with a 54.3% of subjects from the 
chemo arm. 
Drug-related AEs were reported more frequently in the chemo arm (79.5% vs. 90.5%), being the most 
common events in the nivo + ipi arm: rash (17.1%), and pruritus and hypothyroidism (13.4% each). 
SAEs were observed in 66.5% subjects in the nivo + ipi arm compared with the 42.1% in the chemo 
arm and same differences were observed for drug-related SAEs (32% vs. 16.1%). The most common 
drug-related SAEs reported in the nivo + ipi arm were pneumonitis (3.7%), hepatic function abnormal 
(2.5%) and adrenal insufficiency (2.2%). There were 5 (1.6%) subjects for which primary reason for 
death was recorded as study drug toxicity in the nivo + ipi arm and 4 (1.3%) subjects in the chemo arm. 
IMAEs  observed  were  in  line  with  other  already  approved  nivolumab  and  ipilimumab  therapeutic 
indications.  
The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation was similar in both treatment arms (25.2% 
vs. 25.3%). Also, for drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, the same trend was observed (17.7% 
vs. 19.4%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Liver tests abnormalities were more commonly reported in the nivo + ipi arm compared with the chemo 
arm but not all these abnormalities were translated into hepatic adverse events although liver enzymes 
and  bilirubin  monitoring  are  useful  for  early  identification  of  these  events.  Recommendations  for 
management of immuno-related hepatitis are already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Vital signs observations were submitted by individual patient listings in the initial application so a proper 
assessment of the possible changes has not been performed. Instead, a manual review of PTs that could 
be linked to vital sign-related AEs was presented. 
Some differences were identified in the incidences of all-causality any-grade AEs by sex but no particular 
trend could be identified.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In study CA209648 treatment with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab showed a statistically 
significant improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy (fluorouracil plus cisplatin) in the all-
randomised patient population. No statistically significant differences were observed between both 
treatment arms in PFS, as assessed by BICR. However, results in the overall population are considered

to be driven by patients with tumour cell PD-L1≥1% (primary efficacy population). In patients with PD-
L1<1%, the benefit of the combination of nivo+ipi over chemotherapy is not justified and therefore the 
indication has been restricted to patients with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%. 
From a safety point of view the combination of nivo+ ipi is characterised by substantial toxicity, with a 
higher rate of SAEs compared with chemotherapy. The most commonly reported drug-related AEs with 
nivo+ipi were rash, pruritus and hypothyroidism. As expected, select AEs, IMAEs and OESIs were 
frequently reported with this combination, especially regarding endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary and skin 
categories. However, overall the safety profile appears in line with the already known safety profile of 
this combination. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab has demonstrated superiority over chemotherapy in OS 
(and ORR) in patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥1%. Moreover, while this combination entails an 
important toxicity it may be an alternative treatment option for this patient population with a different 
safety profile.  
Having all considered, the benefit/risk balance of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in the 
claimed indication is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk of Opdivo and Yervoy in the currently applied indication is positive.

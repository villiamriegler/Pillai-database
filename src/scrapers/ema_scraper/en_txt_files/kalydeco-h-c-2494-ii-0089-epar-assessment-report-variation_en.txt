2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Kalydeco is approved in the EU in a combination regimen with Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; 
ELX/TEZ/IVA) to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for 
the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or 
heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation.  
This Type II variation application seeks to expand the indication of Kalydeco in combination with 
Kaftrio to patients with CF aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the 
CFTR gene, regardless of the second CFTR allele (F/any). This application was supported by Study 104,  
a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to either IVA or 
TEZ/IVA in subjects who have an F508del mutation on 1 allele and either a gating (F/Gating) or 
residual function (F/RF) mutation on the other allele. For patients with these genotypes, the non-
F508del allele is responsive to an approved CFTR modulator: Kalydeco (IVA monotherapy, tablets) is 
approved to treat patients with gating mutations (10 mutations indicated), and Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) is 
approved to treat patients with F/RF genotypes (14 F/RF genotypes indicated).

2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The CFTR 
protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water 
absorption and secretion. In CF patients, loss of chloride transport due to defects in the CFTR protein 
result in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic 
function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride 
concentration.   
The claimed indication is as follows: 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 
mg/elexacaftor 100 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
The most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Therefore, the claimed indication would cover the 
majority of the CF population even though the genetic diversity of the European CF population is 
higher, with more people without an F508del mutation on either allele. The frequency of the F508del 
mutation ranges from 60 to > 80% of CF alleles in Northern European countries down to < 40 to 60% 
in southern European regions (De Boeck K, Lee T, Amaral M, et al. Cystic fibrosis drug trial design in 
the era of CFTR modulators associated with substantial clinical benefit: stakeholders’ consensus view.  
J Cyst Fibros 2020;19(5):688-695).  
Epidemiology 
Cystic fibrosis affects approximately 30,000 individuals in the United States (US)1 and a total of 42,000 
in the EU (excluding the data from Russia, Turkey and Israel)2. The incidence and prevalence of CF 
vary between racial groups; CF is considerably more common in the Caucasian populations of North 
America and Europe than in Asian and African populations.  
The prevalence of certain CF complications varies according to the age group. Exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency is often already present from birth or develops in infancy. CF related liver cirrhosis 
clinically presents most frequently between the ages of 5 to 15 years, but with a lower frequency in 
the third decade. CF related pulmonary disease mostly starts in childhood. CF related diabetes often 
starts to develop in patients around the age of 10 years and may progress in severity over years to 
insulin dependency. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. 
The current life expectancy is > 30 years. The ageing of the CF population has brought a paradigm 
shift in outlook in the adult healthcare sector, from a focus on the care of lung disease to the 
management of a complex multi-system chronic illness, including the care for diabetes, renal function, 
osteoporosis, and hepatic function.  
Data in the literature suggest that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with 
CF; studies have demonstrated benefits such as improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung 
disease through early intervention in children diagnosed by newborn screening.

Biologic features 
CFTR mutations can be classified according to the mechanisms by which they disrupt CFTR function. 
Stop codon mutations (class I) result in a truncated non-functional CFTR, class II mutations consist of 
aberrantly folded CFTR protein that is degraded by the cell quality control system, while class III 
mutations lead to defective regulation of the CFTR protein and, consequently, the absence of CFTR 
function. These three classes usually lead to a classic CF phenotype with pancreatic insufficiency. CFTR 
mutations that lead to defective chloride conductance are grouped together in class IV. Class V 
mutations interfere with normal transcription, thereby reducing the amount of otherwise normal CFTR. 
These latter two classes are mostly associated with a milder expression of the disease.  
CF-causing mutations can be divided into 2 groups based on the extent of loss of chloride transport 
caused by the mutation. A complete or near complete loss of CFTR chloride transport is referred to as 
“minimal function” of CFTR. A less complete loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport is referred to as 
“residual function” of CFTR.  
The classic or typical form of CF is diagnosed if a patient demonstrates clinical disease in one or more 
organ systems and has elevated sweat chloride (≥60 mmol/L). Most of these patients have disease 
manifestations in multiple organ systems (pancreas, upper and lower respiratory tract, and male 
reproductive tract). There is a wide spectrum of severity in CF, even among patients who have the 
same genotype. Some patients are severely affected, with symptoms already present at birth 
(meconium ileus). Most patients develop symptoms during childhood, while some patients may only 
demonstrate mild or atypical symptoms in adulthood. Usually, patients with class I-III mutations are 
more severely affected than those with other class mutations. 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
The disease phenotype differs considerably among patients, even among patients with the same 
genotype. The CFTR genotype primarily determines the degree of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, 
sweat chloride concentration and malformation of the male reproductive tract. However, factors 
independent of the CFTR genotype are responsible for variation in lung disease, the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in CF. In lung disease, environmental factors, socio-economic factors and also 
the presence of modifier genes play an important role. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity 
and mortality in people with CF. However, CF is a systemic disease and complications such as cystic 
fibrosis-related diabetes and cystic fibrosis-related liver disease have emerged as important causes of 
morbi-mortality which are usually present in the paediatric age. 
Management 
Most treatments available for the treatment of CF are symptomatic, but the CFTR modulators may 
improve CFTR function, which is believed to be the primary cause of disease. Current treatment 
guidelines recommend CFTR modulator and symptomatic medications concomitantly administered to 
maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations, and improve 
quality of life. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
In the EU, Kalydeco is indicated in monotherapy for patients with certain pre-specified gating (class 
III) mutations as well as for those with the R117H-CFTR mutation. Kalydeco is also indicated in a 
combination regimen with tezacaftor /ivacaftor for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children 
aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who

are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations of residual 
function in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, 
R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. It is also indicated in 
combination with elexacaftor/tecazaftor/ivacaftor for the treatment of adult and adolescents who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with a minimal function (MF) mutation. 
The scope of the present application is to extend the indication of Kalydeco (tablets) in combination 
with Kaftrio for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis 
(CF) who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
This application consisted of results from clinical study 104. No specific advice was requested/provided 
in relation to this study in heterozygous F508del patients with a second mutation of residual function 
(F/RF) or with defective gating (F/G).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This application was supported by results from Study VX18-445-104 (study 104), a phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of elexacaftor 
combination therapy in subjects with cystic fibrosis who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation 
and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pre-dose concentration values of each analyte (ELX, TEZ, IVA, and relevant metabolites) were 
measured in study 104 and presented as summary statistics by treatment group and for individual 
concentrations (Table 1). Based on an assessment of pre-dose concentrations, ELX and M23-ELX 
reached steady-state by Day 15. Subjects received IVA or TEZ/IVA during the Run-in Period before 
Day 1; therefore, steady-state exposures of IVA, M1-IVA, TEZ, and M1-TEZ were achieved before 
entering the Treatment Period and were maintained through Week 8.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data relevant to this indication in combination with Kaftrio has been provided which was 
considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new data relevant to this indication in combination with Kaftrio has been provided which was 
considered acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio has been adequately investigated.  
The MAH measured the pre-dose concentration values of each analyte (ELX, TEZ, IVA, and relevant 
metabolites) in study 104 and presented it as summary statistics by treatment group and for individual 
concentrations. Based on an assessment of pre-dose concentrations, ELX and M23-ELX appeared to 
reach steady-state by Day 15. Subjects received IVA or TEZ/IVA during the Run-in Period before Day 
1; therefore, steady-state exposures of IVA, M1-IVA, TEZ, and M1-TEZ were achieved before entering 
the Treatment Period and were maintained through Week 8. Furthermore, exposures of all analytes 
were consistent with those observed in previous ELX/TEZ/IVA studies 102 and 103.  
No additional data are required to support this application.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio have 
been adequately investigated and are correctly reflected in the SmPC.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
To support this type II variation, the MAH submitted the results of Study VX18-445-104 (study 104), a 
phase 3, randomized, double-blind, controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Kaftrio in 
combination with Kalydeco in subjects with cystic fibrosis who are heterozygous for the F508del 
mutation and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes). In addition, supportive 
efficacy data from Study 110, a Phase 3, open-label study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy 
of VX-445 combination therapy in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and 
a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF Genotypes) were also submitted.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No new data relevant to this indication in combination with Kaftrio has been provided which is 
considered acceptable. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
VX18-445-104 (study 104): A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of elexacaftor combination therapy in subjects with cystic fibrosis who are 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF 
Genotypes). 
Methods 
This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study. In 
the open-label Run-in Period, subjects were assigned to the IVA or TEZ/IVA comparator group based 
on genotype and received the approved doses of the products (See Table 2). After completing the run-
in subjects were randomized (1:1) to the ELX/TEZ/IVA or control group (IVA or TEZ/IVA).

Study participants 
The key inclusion criteria of study 104 were that subjects are aged 12 years and older, have ppFEV1 
value ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted mean for age, sex, race, and height, a confirmed diagnosis of CF 
by the investigator and stable CF disease as judged by the investigator. 
In addition, subjects were heterozygous for F508del and either a gating or residual function mutation 
(F/G and F/RF genotypes) and was in a region where their genotype and age group were approved 
indications for treatment with IVA and/or TEZ/IVA.  
Twenty-four mutations (10 gating mutations and 14 residual function mutations) were eligible for 
recruitment at EU sites, in line with the approved indications for IVA and TEZ/IVA in the EU. However, 
as other regions have different but overlapping approved lists of genotypes/mutations approved for 
Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor and Ivacaftor, different lists of eligible genotypes were applied in the different

regions. Study wide, 38 mutations (see Table 2) were considered eligible: 12 gating mutations, and 26 
residual function mutations. 
The main exclusion criteria were:  
1.  Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: 
a.  Hemoglobin <10 g/dL 
b.  Total bilirubin ≥2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) 
c.  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), or gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT) ≥3xULN 
d.  Abnormal renal function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤50 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study 
Equation) for subjects ≥18 years of age and ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated by the 
Counahan-Barratt equation) for subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive). 
2.  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation (PEx), or changes in 
therapy (including antibiotics) for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the first dose of 
study drug in the Run-in Period (Day -28). 
3.  Lung infection with microbial pathogen associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary 
status (including, but not limited to, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, and 
Mycobacterium abscessus). For subjects who had a history of a positive culture, the 
investigator applied the following criteria to establish whether the subject was free of infection 
with such organisms: 
a.  The subject did not have a respiratory tract culture positive for these organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent. 
b.  The subject had at least 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for such organisms within 
the 12 months before the date of informed consent, with the first and last of these 
separated by at least 3 months, and the most recent one within the 6 months before 
the date of informed consent. 
4.  Use of prohibited medications within the specified window before the first dose of study drug in 
the Run-in Period (Day -28), (Table 3).

Treatments 
In the open-label Run-in Period, subjects were assigned to the IVA or TEZ/IVA comparator group 
based on F/G or F/RF genotype. During the Run-in Period, subjects in the IVA (F/G patients) 
comparator group received IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h) and subjects in the TEZ/IVA (F/RF 
patients) comparator group received TEZ 100 mg once daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg q12h. After completing 
the Run-in Period, subjects were randomized 1:1 to the ELX/TEZ/IVA or control group. 
The treatment regimens used in study 104 are depicted in Table 4. 
Table 4: Treatment groups and dosages 
Study drug was administered within 30 minutes of consumption of fat-containing food, such as a 
standard “CF” meal or snack by the subject. No dose modifications for toxicity were allowed. 
Treatment was however permitted to be interrupted for toxicity. If any unacceptable toxicity arose, 
individual subjects discontinued dosing. Patients were allowed to receive usual standard of care 
treatment as prescribed by their doctor for their disease, with the caveat that they were to have been 
stable on their regime for at least 28 days prior to Day -28. Subjects were permitted to receive doses 
of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days. 
Information about bronchodilator use during the study was collected and documented.

In general, the primary analyses were conducted with clinic data only. Due to the coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) pandemic, home-assessed spirometry (i.e., spirometry assessed independently by the 
subjects at home) was permitted to be performed for the pulmonary endpoints. An additional analysis 
was performed that included pooled clinic and home-assessed spirometry. 
Due to the pandemic, CFQ-R was also permitted to be performed at home. The main analysis included 
pooled CFQ-R data assessed at the clinic and at home. An additional analysis was performed that 
included only the CFQ-R data assessed at the clinic. Another prespecified analysis was performed that 
included only the CFQ-R data from subjects who completed the Week 8 Visit before the outbreak of 
COVID-19 (defined as 02 March 2020). 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The primary null hypothesis was to be tested is that the mean absolute 
change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 is 0 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group. The null 
hypothesis was to be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
For the primary hypothesis, assuming a within-group standard deviation (SD) of 7.0 percentage points 
and a 10% dropout rate at Week 8, a sample size of 125 subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA arm will have 
>99% power to detect the within-group difference of 3.0 percentage points (1 sample t-test at a 2-
sided significance level of 0.05). 
Randomisation 
Following the Run-in Period, subjects were randomized 1:1 to either the ELX/TEZ/IVA group or the 
control group. Randomization was stratified based on comparator group (IVA comparator versus 
TEZ/IVA comparator), ppFEV1 as determined during the Run-in Period (Day -14 assessment; <70 
versus ≥70), and SwCl as determined during the Run-in Period (Day -14 assessment; <30 mmol/L 
versus ≥30 mmol/L).  
Blinding (masking) 
Study 104 was a double-blind study. All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site 
personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the 
Vertex study team were blinded to the treatment codes, with the exception of the following study 
personnel: 
1.  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in 
the event of a life-threatening medical emergency 
2.  Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
and her foetus in the event of a pregnancy 
3.  Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing 
and reporting regulations

9.  Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analysing PK samples and the Vertex 
bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the

If unblinding was needed to respond to an emergency, the unblinded treatment code was only 
revealed to those personnel who needed to know the code to respond to the safety concern. 
Spirometry and SwCl results were also not revealed during the course of the study to the patients, 
investigators, or to the Vertex team- with the exception of SwCl values screening and Day -14 only.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 2.0 of the SAP is dated 22 June 2020. The SAP was amended to account for implemented 
measures to minimize risk to COVID-19 exposure. The MAH confirmed that this was prior to database 
lock. Key changes to analyses in Version 1.0 of the SAP (06 March 2020) are summarized in Table 5.  
Table 5 Summary of Study VX18-445-104 SAP Changes 
The study completed on 12 June 2020 (date last subject completed last visit). The database lock date 
was 30 June 2020. 
There were no changes to the planned analyses described in SAP version 2.0 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis sets were defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), Safety Set for the 
Run-in Period and Safety Set for the Treatment Period. 
The All Subjects Set included all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. This analysis set was used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, 
unless otherwise specified. 
The FAS included all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and have 
received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The FAS was used to summarize 
subject demographics and baseline characteristics, and for all efficacy analyses in which subjects were 
analysed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified. 
The Safety Set for the Run-in Period included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of TEZ/IVA or 
IVA in the Run-in Period. This safety set was included in individual subject data listings, unless 
otherwise specified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 18/81 
 
 
 
 
The Safety Set for the Treatment Period included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in the Treatment Period. This safety set was used for all safety analyses in which subjects were 
analysed according to the treatment they receive, unless otherwise specified. 
Analysis methods 
Unless otherwise defined, all efficacy analyses described in this section were based on the FAS. 
The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The percent predicted FEV1 is the ratio of FEV1 (L) to the predicted FEV1 (L), 
expressed as a percentage. The predicted FEV1 was calculated using the Global Lung Function 
Initiative1 (GLI). 
The primary analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with 
the absolute change from baseline at Day 15, Week 4 and Week 8 as the dependent variable. The 
model included treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with 
continuous baseline ppFEV1, continuous baseline SwCl, and comparator group (IVA comparator versus 
TEZ/IVA comparator) as covariates. The Day 15 Visit was not included in the estimation of the average 
treatment effect through Week 8. The model was estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. 
Denominator degrees of freedom for the F-test for fixed effects was estimated using the Kenward-
Roger approximation. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject 
errors. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data were assumed to be missing at 
random; consequently, no imputation of missing data were to be performed. 
The primary results obtained from the model was the estimated within-group treatment difference 
through Week 8 (average of Week 4 and Week 8) for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The adjusted means 
with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided P values were provided. Furthermore, the within-
group treatment difference at each post-baseline visit were also provided, obtained from the model. 
The adjusted mean (with SE) obtained from the MMRM analysis at each post-baseline visit up to Week 
8 was plotted by treatment group. 
The primary analysis was conducted with the clinic spirometry data only. An additional analysis may 
also be performed to include pooled spirometry data obtained in the clinic and by Air Next Spirometer, 
if the Air Next Spirometry data are assessed to be reasonably consistent with clinic spirometry data. 
To assess the impact of missing data and the assumption that data are missing at random, a multiple 
imputation algorithm was to be used if at least 10% of the subjects have missing changes in ppFEV1 at 
Week 8 in any treatment group. 
For the secondary endpoints, Absolute change in SwCl for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, Absolute change in 
ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared to the control group and 
Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared to the 
control group analyses were to be based on the same MMRM model as the analysis of the primary 
endpoint.  
Testing procedure 
A hierarchical testing procedure was to be used to control the overall type I error rate at an alpha of 
0.05 for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints tested. The key secondary endpoints 
were only to be tested at an alpha of 0.05 if the primary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline through Week 8 for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was statistically significant. For a test at any step 
to be considered statistically significant within the testing hierarchy, it must be statistically significant, 
and all previous tests (if any) within the hierarchy must be statistically significant at the 0.05 level. 
The testing order of the key secondary endpoints is as follows:

Results 
Participant flow 
During the Run-in Period, 6 subjects discontinued the study for reasons related to the COVID-19 
pandemic, including 1 subject who had an AE of coronavirus infection. 
Of the 258 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period, 5 (1.9%) 
subjects discontinued treatment and the study; although no subject was diagnosed with COVID-19, 1 
subject discontinued the study for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic (physician decision due 
to restrictions for on-site visits). 
The subject disposition of the Treatment Period is depicted in Table 6.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 96 sites in the US, Canada, EU and Australia.  
Study initiation date: 28 August 2019 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form)  
Study completion date: 12 June 2020 (date last subject completed the last visit) 
Patients were followed up for 28 days after study cessation, or patients moved to the open label study 
within 28 days of stopping study drug.  
Conduct of the study 
The global study protocol was amended once; Absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 8 was 
added as an exploratory endpoint to meet an FDA post-marketing commitment. 
The MAH implemented safety measures to provide subjects with the opportunity to continue 
participation in Study 104 while ensuring their safety by minimizing the risk to COVID-19 exposure 
through travel. These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority 
guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining 
compliance with GCP and minimizing impact to study integrity. A summary of these measures 
pertinent to Study 104 are summarized in Table 7.

Prior use of CFTR modulators 
Table 10 provides the number of subjects with and without prior (within 56 days of study enrolment) 
IVA or TEZ/IVA usage by comparator group, consistent with the approach used to analyze the data 
provided for Study 103 in the initial MAA for Kaftrio. Prior usage of CFTR modulators was generally 
similar between the control group and the ELX/TEZ/IVA group for both F/G and F/RF subjects.

Breakdown of the non F allele (RF or G) 
Of the 38 eligible second mutations eligible for the study globally, 24 were in the end enrolled; 14 of 
these were RF mutations, and 10 were G mutations. Only one mutation (in one patient) was recruited 
that was not approved in the EU, the RF mutation R347H (and that patient received control).   
Of the 24 mutations (RF and G) recruited, 12 F/RFs and 7 F/Gs were represented (with at least one 
patient) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group, the remaining 5 were treated with appropriate control.  
The most frequently represented F/RF genotypes recruited and treated had 3849 +10kbC> T (n=39), 
2789+ 5G> A (n=34), A455E (n=22) and 3272-26A>G (n=20) as the non-F allele.  The most 
frequently represented F/G genotypes recruited and treated had G551D and R117H as the second 
allele, each with n=61 and n=16 patients recruited respectively.

Treatment compliance 
Overall treatment compliance rates were very high in Study 104. Of the 258 subjects in the FAS there 
was a mean compliance of 99.6% overall, 99.4% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 99.7% in the control 
group. In both the treatment and control groups 99.2% of subjects had a compliance category of 
≥80%. 
Numbers analysed 
In total 13 patients of the 271 subjects in the All Subjects Set were excluded from the efficacy 
analysis, as they did not reach randomisation: these included the 12 discontinuations previously listed, 
or as in the case of one patient who was randomised but was not treated in the treatment period due 
to an AE. This left a FAS of 258 patients.  
Of the 258 patients in the FAS, 253 (98.1%) completed dosing. 5 patients discontinued during the 
treatment period (see breakdown in Table 6 in participants’ flow section), leaving 253 patients who 
completed the 8 week treatment period and the study. The percentage of subjects who discontinued 
treatment due to AE was low in both treatment groups (triple therapy group: 0.8%; control: 1.6%).  
See participant’s flow section above.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
The study met its primary endpoint; there was a within group absolute improvement of 3.7 pp FEV1 
(95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; P<0.0001) from baseline for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group though week 8 (Table 14).

A sensitivity analysis was performed using the multiple imputation method to assess the impact of 
missing data; and results were consistent with the primary analysis. An additional pre-specified 
analysis was performed that included home-assessed spirometry (i.e., spirometry assessed 
independently by the subjects at home). The results for the through Week 8 endpoint were consistent 
with the primary analysis, i.e., the LS mean within-group absolute change in ppFEV1 was 3.8 (95%CI: 
2.9, 4.7).  
The between-group absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 8 was evaluated as a key 
secondary endpoint. ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
ppFEV1 compared to the control group, with an LS mean treatment difference of 3.5 percentage points 
(95% CI: 2.2, 4.7; P<0.0001). 
Efficacy data on the IVA and TEZ/IVA comparator groups is presented under subgroup analyses. 
Key secondary endpoints 
•  Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 8  
Within- and between-group changes in sweat chloride through Week 8 were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints. Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in 
sweat chloride through Week 8, with a within-group LS mean absolute change from baseline of -22.3 
mmol/L (95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; P<0.0001), see Figure 3. ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment also resulted in a 
statistically significant improvement in sweat chloride through Week 8 compared to the control group, 
with an LS mean treatment difference of -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; P<0.0001).

•  Respiratory domain (RD) of CFQ-R  
This and other secondary endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity, thus the p values are nominal.  
Treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an increase in CFQ-R RD score through Week 8, with a within-
group LS mean absolute change from baseline of 10.3 points (95% CI: 8.0, 12.7; nominal P value 
<0.0001).  ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment also resulted in an increase in CFQ-R RD score through Week 8 
compared to the control group, with an LS mean treatment difference of 8.7 points (95% CI: 5.3, 
12.1; nominal P-value <0.0001). Both changes in CFQ-R RD scores exceeded the MCID of 4 points. 
The main analysis was based on pooled CFQ-R RD scores assessed at the clinic and at home. An 
additional analysis was performed that included only data assessed at the clinic, and the results were 
consistent with the main analysis.  
Efficacy data on the IVA and TEZ/IVA comparator groups is presented under subgroup analyses. 
Responder Analyses 
Table 15 presents responder analyses by treatment group at the requested thresholds (1.5 and 2.5 
percentage points) for ppFEV1; responder analyses for SwCl and CFQ-R RD are also shown.  
For each parameter, the percentage of subjects reaching the specified threshold was substantially 
higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control group. A majority of subjects who received 
ELX/TEZ/IVA had a change in ppFEV1 of ≥1.5 percentage points, a SwCl value <60 mmol/L (i.e., the 
Assessment report

diagnostic threshold for CF), and/or a CFQ-R RD score that met or exceeded the minimum clinically 
important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Approximately 50% of subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA 
had a change in ppFEV1 of ≥2.5 percentage points and a SwCl value <30 mmol/L (i.e., the threshold 
concentration below which CF is considered unlikely). In the control group, a majority of subjects had a 
SwCl value <60 mmol/L; no other parameter thresholds were met by at least half of the subjects in 
the control group.

The results of pre-specified subgroup analyses for ppFEV1 were generally consistent with the result 
from the primary analysis. Subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had improvements in ppFEV1 regardless 
of differences in age, sex, comparator group, baseline lung function, and geographic region.

Lung function endpoints: ppFEV1 
In the IVA comparator group (F/Gating subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in 
ppFEV1 through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 4.2, 7.4), and 
the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus IVA was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 
8.0). In the TEZ/IVA comparator group (F/RF subjects), the within-group LS mean change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 2.5 percentage points (95% CI: 
1.4, 3.5), and the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus TEZ/IVA was 2.0 percentage 
points (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4). 
Sweat Chloride 
In the IVA comparator group (F/Gating subjects), the within-group LS mean change from baseline in 
sweat chloride through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was -21.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.7, -17.8), 
and the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus IVA was -20.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -
14.6). In the TEZ/IVA comparator group (F/RF subjects), the within-group LS mean change from 
baseline in sweat chloride through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -
25.6, -20.6), and the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus TEZ/IVA was -24.8 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -28.4, -21.2).

CFQ-R RD score through Week 8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 10.4 points (95% CI: 7.2, 13.7), and 
the between-group LS mean treatment difference versus TEZ/IVA was 8.5 points (95% CI: 4.0, 13.1). 
The treatment difference for both subgroups exceeded the MCID of 4 points. 
Responder analyses: 
Table 17 presents ppFEV1, SwCl, and CFQ-R RD score responder analyses by comparator group and 
treatment group using the same thresholds as for the overall population. In all cases, the percentage 
of responders was higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control group, and the differences 
between the treatment groups were generally substantial.

Real world data from R/G and F/RF patients  
ppFEV1 data by genotype (Figure 5) were provided by the MAH upon request by CHMP. CF patients 
who met the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) had a CFFPR record of initiating 
treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019, (2) were aged 12 
years and older on the date of treatment initiation, (3) had a F/G or F/RF genotype, and (4) had 
ppFEV1 assessments available both within 90 days before (baseline) and any time after (follow-up) 
treatment initiation through 15 March 2020.

Figure 5 Patient Population Included in the CFFPR Analyses 
Although no changes were made to the analysis period or the inclusion criteria, the number of patients 
with available data increased compared to the previous analysis, due to ongoing data entry into the 
CFFPR. The analysis presented in the Kaftrio MAA included ppFEV1 data from 297 patients (136 F/G 
and 161 F/RF), whereas data from 338 patients were provided in response to this recent query (157 
F/G and 181 F/RF). CFQ-R RD data are not routinely collected by the CFFPR and SwCl is rarely entered 
after CF diagnosis; therefore, no real-world analyses of these endpoints are presented. By-genotype 
analyses of SwCl and CFQ-R RD based on Study 104 and Study 110 data were presented upon request 
by CHMP. 
Outcomes and Data Analysis 
The data analysis approach was the same as the analysis presented in the initial Kaftrio MAA. The most 
recent measurement obtained within 90 days before ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation served as the 
baseline value. The last measurement available in the period following therapy initiation on or before 
15 Mar 2020 served as the follow-up value. The change in ppFEV1 was calculated as a difference 
between the follow-up and baseline value for each patient. Data were summarized for F/G and F/RF 
subgroups, and for each CFTR genotype, using summary statistics (mean and standard deviation 
[SD]).  
Patients who initiated ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in 2019 were followed from the date of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment initiation through 15 March 2020. Treatment duration was calculated for each patient as the 
difference between the date of treatment initiation and the date of the last available post-treatment 
ppFEV1. Recent use of CFTR modulator therapy prior to ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment initiation was defined 
as described in the initial Kaftrio MAA (being exposed to at least one other CFTR modulator in 2019). 
Results 
A total of 338 patients with an F/G or F/RF genotype initiated treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA between 21 
Oct 2019 and 31 Dec 2019 and had lung function measurements available at baseline and follow-up. 
Their mean treatment duration was 68.6 days. Of these patients, there were 157 F/G patients who had 
a mean age of 31.8 years and a mean treatment duration of 66.6 days. There were 181 F/RF patients 
who had a mean age of 39.2 years and a mean treatment duration of 70.3 days. Consistent with the 
previous analysis, the vast majority of the F/G and F/RF patients included in this analysis were 
receiving CFTR modulator therapy prior to initiating ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment (96.8% of F/G patients 
and 87.3% of F/RF patients). 
F/G and F/RF Subgroup Results 
Mean baseline (SD) ppFEV1 values were 70.0 (25.9) for the F/G patients and 66.8 (24.8) for the F/RF 
patients, similar to the previous analysis. Results for the F/G and F/RF subgroups were similar to the 
analysis presented in the initial MAA. ppFEV1 increased by an average of 4.3 percentage points in the 
F/G group and by an average of 3.0 percentage points in the F/RF group (Table 18).

Table 18 Updated CFFPR Data for F/G and F/RF Patients Who Initiated Treatment With 
ELX/TEZ/IVA Between 21 Oct 2019 and 31 Dec 2019 
Results by CFTR Genotype 
ppFEV1 data from the CFFPR before and after initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment are presented by 
genotype in Table 19 (F/G) and Table 20 (F/RF). A total of 16 genotypes were included in the analysis 
(5 F/G and 11 F/RF), including 7 genotypes (3 F/G and 4 F/RF) that are not included in the analysis of 
Study 104 data or Study 110 data. Due to the limitations of RWE data collection, small sample size, 
and associated variability of subgroups, interpretation of these results has limitations. 
Among the 16 CFTR genotypes with data available, an increase in ppFEV1 was observed for 14 
genotypes. For the 2 F/G (G551D, R117H) and 7 F/RF (3849+10kbC>T, A455E, 2789+5G>A, 3272-
26A>G, D1152H, L206W, and P67L) genotypes with both clinical data and real-world data available, 
results were consistent between clinical and real-world data, and showed increased ppFEV1 following 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment.

Table 20 CFFPR Data for F/RF Patients (By Genotype) Who Initiated Treatment With 
ELX/TEZ/IVA Between 21 October 2019 and 31 December 2019 
Among the 2 F/G and 12 F/RF CFTR genotypes that do not have CFTR modulators available in Europe, 
only 1 genotype had sufficient data for inclusion in the analysis (F/R374H). Although there are no 
clinical study or real-world data to share for the other 13 genotypes at this time, the results of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies and CFFPR data can be extrapolated to these patients, because the Phase 
3 studies collectively showed that patients with one copy of F508del derive benefit from ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment, regardless of their second CFTR allele.

Notes 
Analysis 
description 
All primary and key secondary endpoints were controlled for multiplicity and 
were statistically significant in the framework of the testing hierarchy.  
Comparison to the two separate control groups of IVA and TEZ/IVA was not 
prespecified. These analyses were ad-hoc. 
Ancillary analysis 
The Forest Plot for the subgroups analysed, shows a consistent beneficial 
within-group effect for ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Compared to IVA:  
The between-group data show a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 5.8 
percentage point (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0; nominal p<0.0001), in SwCL of -20.0 
mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -14.6; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-RD of 8.9 
points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0; nominal p=0.0008). 
Compared to TEZ/IVA: 
The between-group data show a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 2.0 
percentage point (95% CI: 1.4, 3.5; nominal p=0.0093), in SwCL of -24.8 
mmol/L (95% CI: -28.4, -21.2; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-RD of 8.5 
points (95% CI: 4.0, 13.1; nominal p=0.0003). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The trial included adolescents and adults. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were performed 
using a model similar to that for the primary analysis. Subgroup analyses showed consistent changes 
in ppFEV1 regardless of age, sex, baseline lung function and geographic region. 
Study 104 excluded pregnant and lactating women and also excluded subjects with a history of any 
illness or condition that could confound study results or pose an additional safety risk (e.g. clinically 
significant hepatic cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension). 
The studies did include a small number of patients aged 60/65 years and older, as the maximum age is 
72.7 in the control group and 69.8 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Nineteen patients over the age of 60 
years were recruited to the study. Six patients over the age of 65 years were recruited to the study 
and of these 2 were treated with Kaftrio. Of these, only 1 patient had post-baseline percent predicted 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) data available. The baseline (Day 1) ppFEV1 value was 
85.7% and the average through Week 8 of Study 104 was 85.8%. 
In long-term safety and efficacy Study 110, 6 subjects ≥65 years were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA. The 
data for these subjects are included in Table 22. Results are preliminary; this study is ongoing. The 
study was not powered for this subgroup analysis of subjects at least 65 years of age.

Supportive study 
Study 110 is a Phase 3, open-label study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of VX-445 
combination therapy in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating 
or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF Genotypes).  
The MAH has performed 2 different analyses with data from control patients from Study 104, who 
moved to Kaftrio in the OLE Study 110. Data up to 14 Dec 2020 was included. Figure 6 summarises 
both analyses based on protocol Version 1.0.  
Figure 6 Schematic of Study 110 Design and Analysis 
The first analysis consisted of F/G and F/RF subgroup data analyzed through Week 8, to facilitate 
comparison with results from Study 104  
As of 14 Dec 2020, 251 subjects had received at least one dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 110 and were 
included in the OL Full Analysis Set (OL FAS), including 121 subjects who received control treatment in 
Study 104 and 130 subjects who received ELX/TEZ/IVA in Study 104. There were 92 F/G subjects and 
159 F/RF subjects in the OL FAS. 
The results for both Study 104’s control group and Study 104’s Kaftrio group at open label week 8 are 
displayed in Table 23 (FEV1),

Table 24 (sweat chloride) and Table 25 (CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score) and broken down per F/RF 
and F/G category. For all patients the baseline was taken to be their Study 104 baseline, which given 
the relatively short duration of Study 104 can be accepted. The inclusion of Week 8 open label 
outcomes from the Kaftrio group of Study 104 is useful for comparative purposes.

Domain Score through Open-label Week 8 by Parent Study Treatment Group (Study 110 OL

The second analysis consisted of genotype-level data through Week 24 of the OLE, with data from the 
Study 104 control and ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment arms pooled to maximize the sample size for each 
genotype. 
The second analysis tries to broaden the genotype level dataset with respect to efficacy, given the 
rareness of many of the non-F mutations, and because half of the subjects recruited in Study 104 did

not receive Kaftrio. To optimise the dataset, and minimise the effect of missing data, the MAH has 
pooled patients from both the control and Kaftrio arms in Study 104 (n=251) and has selected a Study 
110 week 24 cut off. For all patients the baseline was taken to be their Study 104 baseline, which 
given the fairly short duration of Study 104 can be accepted for the purpose of this analysis.  
Only CFTR genotypes with 5 or more evaluable subjects were considered suitable for the analysis; data 
from those genotypes represented less than 5 times were considered not reliable enough to be useful.

clinically meaningful improvements following ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment across all genotype groups, 
including F/RF.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this application, based on data in the F/RF and F/G populations from study 104, the MAH applied for 
the inclusion of the following indication in section 4.1 of Kalydeco SmPC:  
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor tablets 
for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have 
at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Supportive data from study 110 and real-world data (from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient 
Registry, CFFPR) from a post-authorisation setting were also provided.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy and safety of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio have been evaluated in 4 studies in CF 
patients aged 12 years and older. The studies 102 (F/MF), 103 (F/F) and 105 (long-term) were 
assessed and discussed in the Kaftrio CHMP AR (EMEA/H/C/005269/0000) and led to the approval of 
Kaftrio in combination use with Kalydeco in F/F and F/MF CF patients. The current extension of 
indication was based on the results of study 104, a randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 48/81 
 
 
 
 
 
study, designed to provide for prescribers and patients a quantification of the magnitude of clinical 
benefit derived from Kaftrio (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) in combination with Kalydeco in F/G and F/RF patients. 
Comparator 
The comparators used are Kalydeco (IVA) in the F/G patients and Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) in the F/RF 
patients. These comparators are considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Duration 
The duration of the treatment period in study 104 was 8 weeks. Such treatment period is not in line 
with the Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(Doc. Ref. EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008-corr*). Furthermore, important parameters such as 
exacerbations, and BMI cannot be reliably measured in such short period. Nevertheless, the sustained 
effect of Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco has been studied in F/G and F/RF patients in study 110 
and the long-term open-label extension study 105. Furthermore, 251 patients enrolled in the open-
label study 110 (out of 253 patients who completed Study 104) and will provide long term safety and 
efficacy data for F/G and F/RF patients for up to 96 weeks, although uncontrolled. Considering the 
above, the current 8-week duration was considered acceptable by CHMP to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio in the F/G and F/RF CF populations. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to the criteria for studies 102 and 103 (Kaftrio 
CHMP AR -EMEA/H/C/005269/0000). In these studies, the patient population targeted in terms of 
disease severity was moderate to severe disease, which is considered to represent the patients most 
likely to demonstrate improvement. In study 104, the CF diagnosis was confirmed by the investigator. 
Considering that all the subjects will have two disease causing mutations, the minimal sweat chloride 
value was not considered to be a prerequisite for the CF diagnosis. Therefore, the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were considered acceptable by CHMP.  
Patients with an F/G or F/RF were eligible when they were treated in a region where their genotype 
and age group were approved indications for treatment with IVA and/or TEZ/IVA. Considering that the 
approved mutations for Kalydeco and Symkevi differ between the US and the EU, patients may have 
been included in the trial while their mutation is not included in the indications currently approved in 
the EU. This was the case for two gating mutations and 12 residual function mutations. However, only 
one of these mutations (R347H patients) was recruited in the trial and is described under the results 
section below. Therefore, the population included in the trial was overall considered representative of 
the Kalydeco and Symkevi approved European populations. 
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 8 for the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group in study 104. The comparison for ppFEV1 to the control group (IVA and TEZ/IVA 
treatments) was made as a key secondary endpoint (step 3 in the confirmatory hierarchical testing 
procedure). Furthermore, the absolute changes from baseline in SwCL (both with and without 
comparison to the control group) were also included as key secondary endpoints. The primary and key 
secondary endpoints as well as the other secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints such as CFQ-R 
score and BMI are accepted endpoints in CF clinical studies. 
The study sample size was chosen based on power calculations for the overall ELX/TEZ/IVA group. 
Therefore, the study was not powered for between-group comparisons nor designed for subgroup 
analyses (F/RF and F/G). An alternative design to enable a between group primary comparison for F/G 
(ELX/TEZ/IVA versus IVA) and a between group primary comparison for F/RF (ELX/TEZ/IVA versus 
TEZ/ IVA) would have been more informative from a regulatory perspective. Upon request by CHMP, 
the MAH presented the requested subgroup analyses, however, these may be underpowered based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 49/81 
 
 
 
the numbers in the subgroups. This is further discussed below (see discussion of the results). The 
same limitations as outlined above for the primary endpoints, also apply to the key secondary 
endpoints (FEV1 and SwCl). Moreover, the remaining following secondary endpoints were not 
controlled for multiplicity: within group and between group absolute change in CFQ-R RD through week 
8 from baseline, absolute change from baseline in CFQ-R RD through week 8 in treatment versus 
control, and absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 8 in treatment versus control.   
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, home assessments of FEV1 and CFQ-R were permitted. Sensitivity 
analyses were provided to verify the results based on clinic data only or on clinic and home 
assessments data. Based on these unforeseen circumstances, this approach was considered acceptable 
by CHMP.  
Statistical Analyses 
The primary analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with 
the absolute change from baseline at Day 15, Week 4 and Week 8 as the dependent variable. The 
primary result obtained from the model was the estimated within-group treatment difference through 
Week 8 (average of Week 4 and Week 8) for the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Similar analysis approaches were 
used for the secondary longitudinal endpoints, including the between-group treatment difference for 
ppFEV1 and SwCL. These statistical analysis approaches are in line with the analyses used to support 
the initial approval of Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco and are thus overall acceptable.   
The MMRM models used to analyse the primary and key secondary endpoints did not include 
comparator-by-treatment, comparator-by-visit and comparator-by-treatment-by-visit interaction terms 
as a fixed effect. Upon request by CHMP, the MAH provided results for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints including these three terms in the MMRM model. The results of these sensitivity analyses 
were consistent with the primary analyses. 
Furthermore, the MAH summarised the missing data patterns for the ppFEV1 and SwCl variables 
across Day 15, week 4 and week 8 visits by treatment and mutation class, i.e. (F/G ELX/TEZ/IVA; F/G 
IVA; F/RF ELX/TEZ/IVA; F/RF TEZ/IVA). The MAH categorised missing data causes into two categories. 
The missing at random assumption was considered plausible for category 2 missing data (including 
missed visits due to COVID) while missing not at random was considered more plausible for category 1 
missing data.  
Upon request by CHMP, he MAH presented sensitivity analyses for between-group comparisons of the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 using a reference-based imputation approach 
for (a) the overall trial population and (b) each comparator subgroup. Reference-based imputation was 
performed separately by comparator group. The least squares mean at each visit (Day 15, Week 4, 
Week 8) were provided. The results of these sensitivity analyses are considered consistent with the 
primary analyses.  
The trial was amended once, to include an absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 8 as an 
exploratory endpoint. This amendment does not impact the entire conduct of the trial. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were overall balanced between the two treatment groups in 
study 104. In addition, the demographic and baseline characteristics for each patient population were 
presented by the MAH (F/RF, TEZ/IVA comparator group and F/G, IVA comparator group) and were in 
general balanced between the two treatments.  
The median weight, height and BMI for both treatment and control groups were matched, the overall 
mean BMI was 24.06 kg/m2 (range 15.81 to 44.36). The mean age of the patient population recruited 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 50/81 
 
 
 
was older than the one recruited in the 2 pivotal trials of Kaftrio initial MA: the mean age for Studies 
102 and 103 was in the mid-late 20s, whereas for study 104 there was a mean age of 37.7 years. Both 
genotype-based comparator groups in Study 104 were older, on average, than the F/G and F/RF 
subjects in previous Vertex CF programs. The minimal and maximum ages included in the studies are 
relatively similar. It is acknowledged that the older age of the F/RF subjects was caused by the 
different natural history for these patients. Thus, if the patients had a milder course, as could be 
hypothesised on their higher mean age and still reasonably well-preserved pulmonary function, the 
observed gain ppFEV1 can even be considered more relevant. 
In terms of previous or baseline treatments, the groups were also overall similar (dornase alpha 
(52.3%), azithromycin (44.2%), inhaled antibiotic (40.7%), any bronchodilator (86.8%), inhaled 
hypertonic saline (43%). Overall the 2 groups were balanced for these prior therapies; any of the small 
differences were unlikely to be meaningful. For subgroups based on the control treatment IVA and 
TEZ/IVA, an imbalance was seen in the concomitant use of azithromycin in the F/G population (55.6% 
in the IVA group and 34.0% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group). Considering all the other baseline parameters 
and concomitant medication that were very balanced between the IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA group; it was 
considered unlikely that this imbalance was caused by a difference is CF severity between these 
groups.   
In terms of baseline characteristics, the included populations might have a relatively milder CF 
severity, as opposed to the one that was included in the studies supporting the Symkevi and Kalydeco 
registration dossier; i.e. the SwCl values were lower in the study 104. Upon request by CHMP, the MAH 
explained that these baseline levels were measured after the 4-week TEZ/IVA or IVA run-in period. 
After these 4 weeks an effect of TEZ/IVA was indeed expected, which explained that these lower SwCL 
levels seen in study 104 were comparable to SwCl values after IVA or TEZ/IVA treatment in the F/G 
and F/RF patients in registration studies for Kalydeco and Symkevi, respectively. This was considered 
acceptable by CHMP.  
Furthermore, some patients were included with baseline ppFEV1 values below <40 and over 90. It is 
anticipated that the inclusion criterion pertaining to screening ppFEV1 was met in all enrolled subjects 
in Study 104, but the ppFEV1 decreased at their baseline study visit. 
In terms of the included genotypes with a gating mutation (IVA comparator group) represented in the 
clinical study, across the 95 F/G subjects, 10 different gating mutations have been represented. These 
are the 10 different mutations that are included in the Kalydeco PI in the EU. For the genotypes with a 
residual function mutation (TEZ/IVA comparator group), across the 163 subjects, 14 different 
mutations have been represented. The R347H genotype is only included in the US label, but only 1 
patient with this mutation was included in the study. The S977F mutations are also included in the EU 
Symkevi label, but not included in the study. This was considered acceptable as this mutation is very 
rare (CFTR2 database only includes 13 patients with this genotype). The fact that distribution of the 
included mutations was unequal (e.g. over half of the IVA comparator group has the G551D mutation) 
is related to the prevalence of these mutations in the overall CF population. Thus, 14 RFs and 10 Gs 
mutations were recruited, and the MAH estimated that these 24 mutations covered the vast majority 
(> 95%) of patients with G and RF mutations. However, it should be noted that not all of these 
mutations were treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA in study 104; only 12 RFs, and 7 Gs mutations were 
represented at least once in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. In order to provide a more complete assessment 
of the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA across the various G and RF mutations, the MAH provided an analysis of 
available efficacy data for the patients treated with control group in study 104, who then moved to 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in the open label study 110; this is further discussed below.  
In the overall population, the use of concomitant medication was equal between the control group and 
the group receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA. In the F/RF (TEZ/IVA comparator group) and F/G (IVA comparator 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 51/81 
 
 
 
group) populations the use of most concomitant medication was also in general well balanced. 
However, an imbalance was seen for azithromycin in the F/G population (55.6% in the IVA group and 
34.0% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group). Considering all other baseline parameters and concomitant 
medication are very balanced between the IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA group it was considered unlikely that 
this imbalance was caused by a difference is CF severity between these groups. And, because of the 
large benefit seen with TEX/IVA/ELX, it was not expected that this slight imbalance would impact the 
B/R in the F/G CF patient population.  
With regard to prior medication, it was considered of importance to know which percentage of the 
subjects received TEZ or TEZ/IVA prior to the study; as in the Kaftrio registration procedure, the 
ppFEV1 measurements were influenced by whether the patients were Vertex CFTR modulator naïve or 
experienced. The data at that time suggested that the screening period of 4 weeks may not have been 
sufficient for CFTR-modulator naïve patients randomized to TEZ/IVA to derive the full benefit of this 
treatment by time of baseline ppFEV1 assessment. Therefore, and upon request by CHMP, the MAH 
performed subgroup analysis to compare treatment effect on ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-R in patients who 
already have been on Vertex CFTR modulators at recruitment to those who were treatment naïve. In 
general, less F/RF patients were on prior modulator therapy compared to F/G patients. However, in the 
separate patient populations, the prior modulator use was well balanced between placebo and active 
treatment group (see further below for efficacy results). 
Efficacy results for the total population 
For the primary endpoint, the absolute within-group change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 
of ELX/IVA/TEZ group was 3.7pp (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; p<0.0001). As FEV1 is linked to mortality, any 
significant difference could be considered clinically relevant. The result of the sensitivity analysis, a 
MMRM based on multiple imputations (MI), was consistent with the primary analysis. The absolute 
change in ppFEV1 compared to the control group was a key secondary endpoint. The result of this 
analysis was consistent with the within-group changes (3.5; 95% CI: 2.2, 4.7; p<0.0001). 
Nevertheless, given the diversity of the patients recruited (24 genotypes, both F/G and F/RF 
genotypes), some genotypes may not have gained a clinically significant amount of FEV1 function. This 
concern applies in particular to the F/RF group. To address this concern, a sensitivity analysis was 
performed using the multiple imputation method to assess for impact of missing data, and results were 
consistent with the primary analysis. 
For the key secondary endpoint, the absolute within-group change in SwCl from baseline through week 
8 of ELX/IVA/TEZ was -22.3 (95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; p<0.0001). This reduction is considered clinically 
relevant (MCID: -10 mmol/L). The SwCl comparison with the control group was consistent and resulted 
in a reduction of 23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; p<0.0001).  
Other secondary endpoints included the change in CFQ-R RD score from baseline both within-group 
changes and compared to the control group. The additional endpoints are not under type I error 
control, and as such, can be considered to only provide supportive data. The within-group difference is 
an increase in score of 10.3 points (95% CI: 8.0, 12.7; nominal p<0.0001) and compared to the 
control group the treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an increase of 8.7 points (95% CI: 5.3, 
12.1; nominal p<0.0001). A difference of over 4 points in CFQ-R RD score is considered to be clinically 
relevant. Other CFQ-R domains (Physical and Vitality) indicated an improvement with Kaftrio in 
combination with Kalydeco compared with the comparator group.  
In order to establish the proportion of the treatment group that achieved a meaningful benefit in FEV1, 
SwCl and CFQ-R RD score, responder analyses were performed using a threshold of 1.5 % and 2.5% 
for ppFEV1, <60 mmol/L and <30 mmol/L for SwCL and difference of 4 points in CFQ-R score. 
Analyses were performed for the total population and separately by comparator group. Overall, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 52/81 
 
 
 
percentage of responders was higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control group, which 
confirms the benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA. Consistent with the efficacy data seen so far, the effect in the 
F/RF patients is more moderate, but still present and considered clinically relevant.  
For ppFEV1 and for the CFQ-R additional analyses were performed, including spirometry data from a 
home-setting and CFQ-R data from only the clinic setting. These showed consistent results with the 
main analyses for these endpoints.  
A limitation of the current design is that the effect in the separate F/G and F/RF population was not 
tested. Since these populations usually have a different CF severity and because the standard CFTR 
modulator is different in these population, it was important to see whether an additional benefit was 
seen when treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA over the approved therapy IVA or TEZ/IVA. Considering the 
hypothesis that the mechanism of action is mainly through the F508del allele, a beneficial effect over 
the approved therapies was expected. Further, ELX/TEZ/IVA might also act via the non-F508del allele. 
Therefore, a difference in effect size might be present between subjects with a gating or a residual 
function mutation. Therefore, upon request by CHMP, the MAH was requested to include analyses of 
the primary and key secondary endpoints per genotype/comparator group (F/G and F/RF). Those are 
discussed below.  
F/G population 
In the F/G population, TEZ/IVA dual therapy (which mainly works on the non-F508del allele) did not 
result in clinically relevant benefit. As ELX/TEZ/IVA is suggested to act trough the F508del allele, an 
effect over IVA was anticipated in this population. Within-group and between-group analyses for 
ppFEV1, SwCL and CFQ-R RD in the F/G population were provided by the MAH. Consistent with the 
within-group difference, the between-group data show a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 5.8 percentage 
point (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0; nominal p<0.0001), in SwCL of -20.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.5, -14.6; nominal 
p<0.0001) and in CFQ-RD of 8.9 points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0; nominal p=0.0008). These results are 
overall considered clinically relevant and indicated that the ELX/TEZ/IVA had a beneficial effect in the 
F/G population over IVA monotherapy. The gain in ppFEV1 seen in the F/G group was in line with the 
expectations based on the ‘treat the F’ treatment paradigm (effect on F508del allele) put forward by 
the MAH. The cumulative effect of the 3 agents in F/G patients was very similar to what was achieved 
in F/MF CF patients. 
F/RF population 
Based on the MAH’s F508del hypothesis, ELX/TEZ/IVA was expected to generate a positive clinical 
outcome in the F/RF population. The between-group data showed a beneficial change in ppFEV1 of 2.0 
percentage point (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4; nominal p=0.0093), in SwCL of -24.8 mmol/L (-28.4, -21.2; 
nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-RD of 8.5 points (4.0, 13.1; nominal p=0.0003). The magnitude of 
effects in patients with F/RF on SwCl and CFQ-R with ELX/TEZ/IVA are similar when compared to the 
F/G population. However, the ppFEV1 benefit was lower, with an increase of 2.0 percentage points 
compared to TEZ/IVA. This increase was thus lower than initially expected. Based on the response to 
ELX/TEZ/IVA seen in F/F and F/MF patients, and the ‘treat the F theory’ it would have been be 
anticipated that treating an F/RF patient with ELX/TEZ/IVA might bring a total gain in ppFEV1 of 
approximately 14%. It would have been expected that the F/RF patients should have gained more in 
ppFEV1 than the F/G patients, however, the F/G patients seem to have gained a better response. A 
greater response with F/RF patients would have been anticipated with the triple combination compared 
to the reasonably modest ppFEV1 6.8% observed in Study VX14-661-108 with TEZ/IVA over placebo.  
A similar pattern was also noted in the real-world US registry data, where F/G patients also seemed to 
obtain a better response to the triple combination versus F/RF patients. While it is agreed that a gain 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 53/81 
 
 
 
of 2% over TEZ/IVA might be considered clinically relevant for a patient with an F/RF genotype, it was 
not certain that all F/RF patients will have achieved a clinically meaningful response. 
The reason why F/RF subjects had lower ppFEV1 improvements on ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to F/MF, 
F/F, and F/G subjects is unclear, but may be related to reduced severity of CF in those patients. F/RF 
mutations, which are generally Class IV or Class V, cause a more modest reduction in CFTR function 
compared to Class I, II, and III mutations, such as F/MF mutations, the F508del mutation, and the 
G551D mutation, respectively. As a result, untreated patients with F/RF mutations have a less severe 
CF phenotype, characterized by later diagnosis, lower baseline SwCl, a lower prevalence of pancreatic 
insufficiency, and a slower pace of lung function decline compared to patients with Class I, II, and III 
mutations; however, they continue to have signs and symptoms of CF and premature mortality. These 
differences in RF patients’ underlying disease progression and age at diagnosis may impact the 
potential for CFTR modulator treatment to increase ppFEV1. 
Nevertheless, overall, the totality of the data supported the conclusions of an effect, with a 95% CI 
between 0.5 and 3.4 percentage points. Although, an MCID for FEV1 cannot be defined, according to 
the “report of the workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical trials”, a treatment effect equivalent 
to the average annual loss in FEV1 can be considered as clinically relevant. Based on published 
literature, the annual rate of ppFEV1 decline in F/RF patients is around 0.70. When excluding R117H 
patients from the cohort, the annual decline is -1.05 points. Considering these annual decline rates, 
the 2.0 percentage point is considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, highly clinically relevant 
improvements in SwCL and CFQ-R are seen which further support the approval in F/RF CF patients.  
To put the efficacy results in the F/RF population into perspective; in the initial Symkevi procedure 
(study VX14-661-108), TEZ/IVA showed improvements over placebo of ppFEV1 of 6.8 percentage 
points, -9.5 mmol/L in SwCl and of 11.1 points in CFQ-R in the F/RF population. When compared to 
IVA monotherapy the benefit in ppFEV1 was 2.1 percentage points, and for CFQ-R it was 1.4 points 
increase.  
Therefore, the efficacy outcomes for ELX/TEZ/IVA showed a clinically relevant improvement over the 
approved control therapy IVA or TEZ/IVA in the F/G and F/RF populations, respectively.  
To further confirm the effects seen in the total and comparator group population, several additional 
analyses were provided, such as COVID-19 sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses per comparator 
subgroup, analyses based on experienced or naïve CFTR modulator patients, and analyses in subsets 
of specific mutations. In general, all these additional analyses resulted in consistent outcomes 
compared to the previous analysis presented. These analyses were considered to further confirm the 
beneficial effects of TEZ/IVA/ELX seen in study 104 in both the F/G and F/RF populations. These are 
discussed below.  
Additional analyses performed by comparator group 
As indicated above, the main interest lays in the effect in the two separate comparator groups. To 
evaluate the effects in the F/G and F/RF populations further and more in depth, some additional 
analyses were performed by the MAH upon request by CHMP. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
additional sensitivity analyses were done for pooled clinic and home assessment of the ppFEV1 and or 
clinic only CFQ-R scores. The MAH provided these analyses also for the subgroups by the comparator. 
For the F/G group, LS mean difference in ppFEV1 was 5.8% in the original and 5.9% in the sensitivity 
analysis. With regard to CFQ-R an LS mean difference of 8.9 points in the original and 8.3 points in the 
sensitivity analysis. For the F/RF group, the LS mean difference in ppFEV was 2.0% in the original and 
1.8% in the sensitivity analysis. With regard to CFQ-R the LS mean difference of 8.5 points in the 
original and 9.1 points in the sensitivity analysis. Results per comparator subgroup were consistent 
with the original subgroup analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 54/81 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the MAH also performed the subgroup analyses for age, sex, baseline lung function, and 
geographic region per comparator subgroup which were consistent with the overall results per 
comparator group.  
In addition, the MAH was requested to perform subgroup analysis to compare treatment effect on 
ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-R in patients who already have been on Vertex CFTR modulators at recruitment 
to those who were treatment naïve. Overall, a beneficial effect was seen for all three parameters in 
both patients ‘CFTR modulators experienced’ and ‘CFTR modulator naïve’. However, in the F/RF 
population the effects on ppFEV1 (1.7% vs 2.8%) and SwCL (-16.4 mmol/L vs -28.7 mmol/L) seemed 
to be less pronounced in the patients who were already treated with a Vertex CFTR modulator 
compared to those who were treatment naive. Although it is generally accepted that a run-in period of 
4 weeks is sufficient to obtain an on-treatment baseline, these efficacy results suggested that a 
maximum effect might not be completely established after 4 weeks. This was also reflected in the 
results of the comparator groups. Therefore, the overall data in F/RF reflect mainly the results of the 
2/3 of the patients who were not on prior Vertex CFTR modulator treatment before inclusion in study 
104. However, the limited number of patients, hampered a firm interpretation of these results. 
Moreover, the efficacy outcomes for SwCL and CFQ-R RD score in both patients with and without prior 
CFTR modulator therapy were considered clinically relevant. Therefore, these results were not 
considered to further influence the B/R assessment.   
Furthermore, per comparator subgroup, responder analyses were performed. Substantial increases in 
proportion of ppFEV1, SwCl and CFQ-RD responders are observed for the TEZ comparator group. While 
more modest increases are observed for the TEZ/IVA comparator group, these could still be considered 
clinically relevant. 
Elderly 
Although the preliminary data from ongoing Study 110 in patients ≥65 years are limited, and the data 
provided an idea on the benefit in these older patients. Nevertheless, the numbers remain insufficient 
to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger adults. This has been 
adequately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
Supportive Efficacy data (Study 110) 
With regard to data obtained from follow-up study 110, patients treated with control in study 104 and 
who then switched to Kaftrio had improvements in ppFEV1, SwCl, and CFQ-R that were very similar to 
those seen in study 104 treatment group, in both the F/G and F/RF categories at week 8. While the 
preliminary data from ongoing Study 110 are limited and the study was not powered for these 
subgroup analyses, this analysis is considered to be supportive of the results of study 104. The data 
also suggested that the gains in the Kaftrio treated group (in combination with Kalydeco) of study 104 
were maintained in study 110.  
Real world clinical data 
Updated registry data were presented for patients with F/G and F/RF genotypes. ppFEV1 increased by 
an average of 4.3 percentage points in the F/G group and by an average of 3.0 percentage points in 
the F/RF group. The newly provided RWE analysis further confirmed the beneficial effects of 
TEZ/IVA/ELX seen in study 104.  
To identify the robustness of this effect and see whether different gating and residual function 
mutations might influence the effect size, it was of interest to see the clinical benefit in a subset based 
on specific mutations. In study 104, patients representing a total of 24 mutations (F/RF and F/G) were 
recruited, 12 F/RFs and 7 F/Gs were represented (with at least one patient) in the Kaftrio treatment 
group; the remaining 5 were treated with appropriate control. Moreover, information on additional 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 55/81 
 
 
 
mutations were also provided from study 110 and from the real-world effectiveness registry data. For 
almost all of the genotypes included in both the F/G and F/RF categories, a clinical benefit of some 
degree could be seen, and in most cases, were considered to be meaningful. Overall, the CHMP 
considered that the totality of the data provides sufficient information on patients with F/RF and F/G 
mutations but also to conclude that Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio provides efficacy in patients 
with at least one F508del mutation.  
Indication 
Kalydeco is currently approved in combination with Kaftrio for F/F and F/MF mutations and 
demonstration of efficacy has been demonstrated in F/RF and F/G patients as discussed in this 
application. The CHMP therefore considered the broad indication approvable: 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor /tezacaftor /elexacaftor tablets 
for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have 
at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clinically relevant improvement in ppFEV1, SwCL, and CFQ-R RD score over the approved control 
therapy IVA or TEZ/IVA in the F/G and F/RF population, respectively was shown in study 104.  
Based on these results, the added benefit of the triple combination over approved therapies was 
determined, confirming that the ELX/TEZ/IVA is mainly acting through the F508del allele.  
The effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the F/MF (study 102), F/F (study 103), F/RF (study 104) and F/G (study 
104) population and the maintained effects as seen in study 105 could be sufficient to conclude on the 
benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA in the entire CF population with at least one F508del allele.   
Therefore, the final indication granted by CHMP is as follows:  
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor /tezacaftor /elexacaftor tablets 
for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have 
at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1). 
Changes have been implemented in section 5.1 of the SmPC of Kalydeco to reflect the availability of 
results for the use of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA was characterized based on a comprehensive review of data from 
the clinical development program described in the initial MAA (EMEA/H/C/005269/0000), which 
included over 700 subjects who had received at least 1 dose of ELX as monotherapy or as part of a 
triple combination regimen. 
The safety profile was mainly based on the pivotal study in patients with F/MF mutations. Long-term 
safety data were evaluated in the ongoing open-label extension Study 105, which included 271 
subjects with ≥48 weeks of cumulative ELX/TEZ/IVA exposure (through IA2).  
Overall, ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 
generally mild or moderate in severity. Important AEs observed with incidence rates ≥ 3% and ≥1% 
more frequent than placebo are influenza, wheezing and hypoglycaemia.    
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 56/81 
 
 
 
In Study 102, Grade 3-4 AEs were reported for 9.4% (ELX/TEZ/IVA) vs. 7.5% (placebo) of patients. 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs with an incidence of at least 1% in either treatment group were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (4.5%, placebo), blood creatine increased (2.0%, ELX/TEZ/IVA), ALT 
increased (1%, ELX/TEZ/IVA), and AST increased (1%, ELX/TEZ/IVA).  
SAEs were reported for 13.9% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 20.9 % in the placebo group. The SAEs 
that occurred in ≥1% of patients in either treatment group were infective PEx of CF (5.4% vs. 16.4%), 
haemoptysis (1.0% vs. 1.5%) and rash (1.0% vs. 0.5%) and influenza (1.5% vs 0%). Related SAEs 
occurred in 3.0% (ELX/TEZ/IVA) vs. 1.0% (placebo). No related SAEs occurred in 2 or more patients in 
either treatment group. 
Rash occurred more frequently in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (10.9%, 22 subjects) than in the placebo 
group (6.5%, 13 subjects).  
AEs of CK elevation occurred more frequently in subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared to the 
placebo group. The majority were asymptomatic laboratory elevations, many of which were preceded 
by exercise. The two subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group presented with AEs of rhabdomyolysis with CK 
elevations, did not have clinical features of rhabdomyolysis.   
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred were low. 
The long-term safety data (Study 105 Safety Set, OLS) showed decreased exposure-adjusted event 
rate of (related AEs), Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs with ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to the Study 102 Safety Set. 
In the Cumulative Safety Set, the safety profile is quite similar to the safety profile of Study 102 Safety 
Set.  
The Study 104 Safety Set in CF patients with F/G and F/RF mutations includes all subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Study 104 Treatment Period (i.e., does not include 
subjects who were only dosed in the IVA or TEZ/IVA Run-in Period).  
Patient exposure 
A total of 258 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The exposure 
was similar between treatment groups. The mean exposure was 8.0 (0.7) weeks for the 132 subjects 
in ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7.9 (0.9) weeks for the 126 subjects in the control group (Table 31).

Adverse events 
In the Treatment Period, 88 (66.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 83 (65.9%) subjects in 
the control group had at least 1 AE. Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) 
subjects in the control group had a serious AE (SAE). Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
and 4 (3.2%) subjects in the control group had severe AEs; all other subjects with AEs had AEs that 
were mild or moderate in severity. One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.6%) 
subjects in the control group had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation. Five (3.8%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the control group had AEs that led to study drug 
interruption.

Table 32 presents an overview of AEs. 
Table 32 Summary of AEs - Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
Treatment-emergent AEs 
Overall, the common AEs were mostly consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF 
disease in CF subjects 12 years of age and older or the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
The majority of the common AEs had a lower incidence in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control 
group. AEs with a higher incidence in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (alanine transaminase [ALT] increased, 
aspartate transaminase [AST] increased, and abdominal pain) are all known adverse drug reactions for 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment observed in previous studies. The same 8 subjects had AEs of ALT increased 
and AEs of AST increased.

AEs by Relationship 
The majority of AEs were assessed by the investigator as not related or unlikely related to study drug. 
Thirty (22.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 22 (17.5%) subjects in the control group had 
an AE assessed as possibly related. Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and no subjects in

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
AESIs were defined as AEs related to elevated transaminases and AEs related to rash.  
Elevated Transaminase Events 
Eight (6.1%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group had at least 
1 elevated transaminase event, none of which were serious. Of the 8 subjects who had AEs of 
transaminase elevations in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 5 had modest ALT or AST elevations (<3 × ULN), 
and 2 had ALT or AST elevations >3 to ≤5 × ULN. The remaining 1 subject had ALT >8 × ULN and AST 
>5 × ULN and discontinued study drug and the study. No subjects in the control group discontinued 
study drug due to AEs of transaminase elevations. No subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) 
subject in the control group interrupted study drug due to AEs of transaminase elevations. No subjects 
had transaminase elevations with concurrent total bilirubin elevations. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, elevated transaminase events had mean (SD) duration of 19.4 (7.8) days 
and mean (SD) time-to-onset of 18.3 (19.6) days. The 1 elevated transaminase event in the control 
group had a duration of 16.0 days and time-to-onset of 1.0 day.

for the Treatment Period 
Rash Events 
Four (3.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 (4.0%) subjects in the control group had at 
least 1 rash event. All rash events were mild or moderate in severity. No rash event was serious or led 
to study drug discontinuation. Rash events resulted in study drug interruption for 1 (0.8%) subject in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, the mean (SD) duration of rash events was 6.0 (3.2) days and the mean 
(SD) time-to-onset was 25.8 (14.0) days. In the control group, the mean (SD) duration of rash events 
was 16.4 (19.7) days and mean (SD) time-to-onset was 18.0 (17.0) days. 
Influenza 
Influenza is listed as a common AE in the SmPC for ELX/TEZ/IVA, and is also listed in Section 4.8 for 
IVA.  In Study 104 there were only 4 cases of influenza listed as an AE in total, 2 each for both the 
Assessment report

treatment (1.5%) and control (1.6%) groups. Influenza appears to have been less frequent in Study 
104 and there was no increase seen in the treatment group vs control.  
Pregnancy 
One subject had a positive serum pregnancy test during the TE Period. This subject was in the control 
(TEZ/IVA) group and had a positive pregnancy test on Day 28 of the Treatment Period (ETT Visit). The 
subject discontinued treatment and the study.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths reported. 
SAEs were more common in the control group than in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. Five (3.8%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had at least 1 SAE. 
SAEs of infective PEx occurred in 2 (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7 (5.6%) subjects 
in the control group; all other SAEs occurred in no more than 1 subject per treatment group. 
Table 37 Serious AEs by PT–Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
The majority of SAEs were assessed by the investigator as unlikely related or not related to study 
drug. Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and no subjects in the control group had an AE 
assessed as related.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
There were no clinically relevant trends in haematology parameters in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group or the 
control group. 
Overall, AEs related to haematology were infrequent (no PT occurred in more than 1 subject. None of 
the AEs related to haematology was serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
Non-LFT chemistry  
There were no clinically relevant trends in mean values of other non-LFT chemistry parameters. 
Overall, AEs related to non-LFT chemistry parameters were infrequent (no PT occurred in more than 2 
subjects in a treatment group) and had a similar overall incidence between treatment groups. None of 
these AEs was serious or led to treatment discontinuation or interruption.

Bilirubin 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, increases from baseline in mean (SD) total bilirubin were observed, with a 
maximum increase of 3.8 (6.5) μmol/L at Week 4. The maximum increase in direct bilirubin in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group was 1.1 (1.5) μmol/L at both Week 4 and Week 8. There were no clinically relevant 
trends in total bilirubin or direct bilirubin in the control group. 
The majority of subjects had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range. In the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group, total bilirubin >2 and >3 × ULN occurred in 6 (4.8%) subjects and 2 (1.6%) 
subjects, respectively. In the control group, 1 (0.8%) subject had total bilirubin >2 × ULN and no 
subjects had total bilirubin >3 × ULN. 
Creatinine kinase (CK) 
The majority of subjects had CK levels that remained within the normal range. However, mean CK 
levels in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group increased during the TE Period. The largest mean (SD) change from 
baseline was 74.6 (578.8) U/L at Day 15. Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had CK >5 × 
ULN, including 1 (0.8%) subjects with CK >10 × ULN. Both were considered possibly related.  No 
subjects in the control group had CK >5 × ULN. Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had an 
AE of blood creatinine phosphokinase increased. Neither AE was serious or resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment discontinuation or interruption. No subjects in the control group had AEs of blood creatinine 
phosphokinase increased. No subject had AEs of rhabdomyolysis. 
Vital Signs and ECGs 
Modest increases in blood pressure (BP) were observed. Overall, the findings were consistent with the 
results of previous ELX/TEZ/IVA studies described in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA MAA.  
At baseline, the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had a mean (SD) systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 118.5 (13.8) 
mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 72.1 (9.5) mmHg). The control group’s baseline mean 
(SD) SBP was 117.4 (15.4) mmHg and DBP was 72.2 (9.7) mmHg. SBP and DBP increased during the 
treatment period in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The largest mean (SD) increase in SBP from baseline was 
3.0 (12.4) mmHg (at Week 8) and the largest mean (SD) increase in DBP was 2.5 (8.9) mmHg (at 
Week 8). There were no clinically relevant trends in SBP or DBP in the control group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 66/81 
 
 
 
 
SBP >140 mmHg occurred in 16 (13.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and in 12 (9.9%) 
subjects in the control group. DBP >90 mmHg occurred in 16 (13.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group and 6 (5.0%) subjects in the control group. 
There were no AEs of hypertension in either treatment group. One (0.8%) subject in the control group 
had an AE of hypotension.  
There were no clinically relevant trends in ECG parameters. 
There were no clinically relevant trends in temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, or pulse oximetry. 
Ophthalmological examinations 
While 24 patients (< 18 years) had a baseline eye examination at screening due to their age and due 
to the IVA component of treatment, no subjects had a post baseline exam in the TE period. 3 subjects 
in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had a background history of a cataract, and one in the control group has a 
background history of a cortical cataract. There were no AEs relating to cataracts in Study 104.  
Safety in special populations 
Adolescents 
Of the subjects <18 years of age at screening, 6 (40.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 
(55.6%) subjects in the control group had at least 1 AE in the Treatment Period (Error! Reference 
source not found.)). 
No subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had serious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs, or AEs that led to study 
drug discontinuation. One (11.1%) subject in the control group had severe SAEs in the SOC of 
psychiatric disorders that led to study drug discontinuation. No subjects in either treatment group had 
AEs that led to study drug interruption. 
Most AEs in subjects <18 years of age at screening occurred in no more than 1 subject per treatment 
group by Preferred Term (PT;). AEs of headache and abdominal pain occurred in 2 (13.3%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (33.3%) subjects in the control group. Overall, the AEs were mostly 
consistent with common manifestations or complications of CF disease in CF subjects ≥12 to <18 years 
of age or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific information has been provided. The safety related to drug-drug interactions and other 
interactions remains unchanged.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that 
led to study drug discontinuation ( 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 67/81 
 
 
 
 
). In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, 1 subject discontinued due to severe AEs of ALT increased and AST 
increased, which were not serious and assessed as possibly related to study drug. In the control group, 
1 subject discontinued IVA treatment due to a moderate SAE of infective PEx of CF, which was 
assessed as not related to study drug, and 1 subject discontinued IVA treatment due to SAEs in the 
SOC of psychiatric disorders, which were assessed as possibly related to study drug. 
Table 41 AEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation by PT -Treatment Period (Safety Set) 
Adverse Events That Led to Interruption of Study Drug 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the control group had AEs 
that led to study drug interruption. All of the subjects resumed study drug, except for 1 subject whose 
interruption occurred in Week 8 (Day 58). All AEs that led to study drug interruption occurred in 1 
subject each. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, AEs that led to study drug interruption included pruritus, rash 
macular, tinnitus, tongue ulceration, bilirubin conjugated increased, blood bilirubin increased, and C-
reactive protein increased. In the control group, AEs that led to study drug interruption included 
urticaria, gastritis, and LFT increased. 
Post marketing experience 
ELX/TEZ/IVA (Trikafta) was approved on 21 October 2019 (International Birth Date) in the US. 
ELX/TEZ/IVA (Kaftrio) was approved in the EU on 21 August 2020. Over 17,000 patients have been 
treated with commercial ELX/TEZ/IVA in combination with Kalydeco, representing more than 5,800 
patient-years.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient population and exposure  
The safety of Kalydeco in combination use with Kaftrio has been evaluated in 4 studies in CF patients 
aged 12 years and older, including a long-term extension study during the initial MAA for Kaftrio. In 
the current extension of indication application, 132 patients received Kalydeco in combination with 
Kaftrio in study 104, with mean and median exposure of 8 weeks indicating that the vast majority of 
the patients finalised the study treatment.

Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths  
There were 88 (66.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 83 (65.9%) subjects in the control 
group with at least 1 AE. Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 4 (3.2%) subjects in the 
control group had severe AEs. 
The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were headache, ALT 
increased, AST increased, and abdominal pain. The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
in the control group were headache, cough, infective PEx of CF, nausea, sputum increased, and 
diarrhoea. 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had SAEs. 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Infective PEx of CF occurred in 2 (1.5%) 
subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7 (5.6%) subjects in the control group; all other SAEs occurred 
in no more than one subject per treatment group. There were no life-threatening AEs and no deaths. 
One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation (ALT 
increased and AST increased), and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that led to study 
drug discontinuation (1 subject with an SAE of infective PEx of CF and 1 subject with SAEs in the SOC 
of psychiatric disorders). Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the 
control group had AEs that led to treatment interruption. While 5 subjects are listed as having 
interrupted ELX/TEZ/IVA due to an AE, an additional subject had an interruption of ELX/TEZ/IVA of 3 
days due to a QT prolongation. The QTc value of 440msec was not considered significant compared to 
the patient’s baseline ECG and was also less than 500msec. Furthermore, the patient resumed 
treatment after 3 days with no further QTc increases. This QT prolongation was thus not considered as 
an AE. In addition, an event of pregnancy was reported in Study 104.  
There were no AEs relating to cataracts in Study 104. 
Related SAEs were observed only in 2 subjects in the control group. They were anxiety, depression, 
and haemoptysis. The safety appears similar to the safety established in the clinical development 
program in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA MAA. 
In the case of the treatment group, none of the SAEs were considered to be related. The 6 SAEs in 
those 5 subjects that were in the treatment group were all considered unrelated and included: infective 
pulmonary exacerbations of CF, cellulitis, tinnitus, cholecystitis and haemoptysis. 
Adverse events of special interest  
-Elevated Transaminase Events 
Eight (6.1%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 (0.8%) subject in the control group had an 
AESI of elevated transaminases; the majority of events were mild or moderate in severity, and none 
were SAEs. One (0.8%) subject discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment due to AEs of ALT increased and 
AST increased. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 4 (3.2%), 1 (0.8%), and 1 
(0.8%) subject(s), respectively. In the control group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 2 
(1.6%), 1 (0.8%), and 0 subject(s), respectively. No subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with 
concurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. 
In Study 104, there was a higher incidence of elevated transaminase AEs in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
than in the placebo group. However, elevated transaminases are a known AE of ELX/TEZ/IVA. There 
are no new insights in this AESI. They are already addressed in the SmPC and RMP; no further 
changes are deemed necessary. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 69/81 
 
 
 
 
 
-Rash events 
Rash events (AESI of rash) occurred in 4 (3.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 (4.0%) 
subjects in the control group. All rash events in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were mild or moderate in 
severity. Rash is a known AE of ELX/TEZ/IVA. There are no new insights in this AESI. Rash is already 
addressed in the SmPC and RMP; no further changes are deemed necessary. 
-Influenza 
Influenza is listed as a common AE in the SmPC for ELX/TEZ/IVA and is also listed in Section 4.8 for 
IVA. Susceptibility for influenza virus infections is also an important identified risk within the RMP.  In 
Study 104, there were only 4 cases of influenza, 2 each for both the treatment groups. Influenza 
appears to have been less frequent in Study 104 without a difference between the treatment groups.  
Laboratory findings 
Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. 
Neither AE was serious or resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment discontinuation or interruption. No 
subject in the control group had an AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. Furthermore, CK 
elevations are listed as an ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC, thus, no further actions were deemed 
necessary.  
Rises in blood bilirubin were seen in a small number of patients (4 subjects) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
in Study 104. No AEs related to increased bilirubin were serious or resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA 
discontinuation. One (0.8%) subject had AEs of conjugated bilirubin increased and blood bilirubin 
increased that resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA interruption. Similar findings of bilirubin rises were seen Study 
102. The rises in bilirubin seen in Study 104 appear consistent with those seen in Study 102; no 
further actions were deemed necessary.  
Mean SBP and DBP increased in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The largest mean (SD) increase in SBP from 
baseline was 3.0 (12.4) mm Hg (at Week 8) and the largest mean (SD) increase in DBP was 2.5 (8.9) 
mm Hg (at Week 8). No subjects had AEs related to increased blood pressure. Blood pressure increase 
is a listed ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC, thus, no further actions were deemed as necessary.  
There were no clinically relevant trends in other laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, or 
PEs. 
The safety results appeared generally consistent with the known safety profile; no new safety concerns 
were identified on the provided data. Furthermore, an update of SmPC section 4.8 was not deemed 
necessary as the frequencies of the ADRs in study 104 were not higher than the frequencies of the 
ADRs in pivotal study 102 in F/MF patients or in the cumulative database of studies 102 and 104.  
Study 104 is unusual in that both F/G and F/RF genotypes were combined and randomised as one 
group. No comparison of safety between F/G and F/RF genotypes has been provided. However, there is 
an overall low incidence of severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to low discontinuation/interruption across 
both the combined treatment group and combined control group, and no life-threatening AEs or AEs 
leading to death in either group. The safety data and AE profile from the combined F/G and F/RF group 
are also consistent with those in both F/F and F/MF genotype groups, and it is not anticipated that 
there would be a difference in safety in F/G v F/RF genotypes. For these reasons the value of a 
subgroup analysis by genotype group (F/G and F/RF) for safety is considered limited in terms of 
characterising safety in F/G v F/RFs.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
A total of 24 adolescents were enrolled in study 104, 9 subjects were enrolled in the control group and 
15 in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. No subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had serious AEs (SAEs), severe 
AEs, or AEs that led to study drug discontinuation. Overall, the AEs were consistent with the overall 
study population.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Kaftrio in combination use with Kalydeco was generally safe and well-tolerated for 8 weeks.   
Overall, safety data from Study 104 are consistent with the established safety profile of Kalydeco in 
combination use with Kaftrio. No significant new safety concerns were identified, but the number of 
subjects in the new safety set is relatively small and limited in terms of duration of follow-up. 
Nevertheless, the MAH confirmed that F/G and F/RF genotypes will be included in the planned post-
authorisation safety study (PASS, category 3) consistent with the applied indication of the treatment of 
patients with CF aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, 
regardless of the second allele (F/any). This will allow to gather additional long-term safety data post-
approval. 
Furthermore, the safety of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio will be further monitored in the PSURs 
in the post-marketing setting.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted/was requested to submit an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 11.0 is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities 
and high premature mortality for which and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis is caused by 
mutations in the CFTR gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR protein at the cell 
surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of 
salt and water absorption and secretion. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs 
results in the multisystem pathology associated with CF. Lung disease is the primary cause of 
morbidity and mortality in people with CF. F508del is the most common disease-causing mutation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Two broad types of CF therapies are authorised: symptomatic therapy and CFTR modulator therapy. 
The use of CF therapies that target the symptoms of the disease (such as nutritional supplements, 
antibiotics, and mucolytics), in combination with CFTR modulators (i.e. correctors and potentiators) is 
recommended to maintain and improve lung function, reduce the risk of infections and exacerbations; 
and improve quality of life.  
Correctors (such as tezacaftor and elexecaftor), facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
mutant CFTR to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in enhanced 
chloride transport. CFTR potentiators (like ivacaftor) enhance the channel gating activity of the CFTR 
which is delivered to the cell surface by correctors.  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor, IVA), Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, LUM/IVA), Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, 
TEZ/IVA), and Kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, ELX/TEZ/IVA) are CFTR modulators approved 
for CF patients with specific mutations. 
The claimed indication is as follows: 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 75 mg/tezacaftor 50 
mg/elexacaftor 100 mg tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. 
This proposed indication covers the F/F genotypes and F/MF ‘minimal function’ genotypes in which 
Kalydeco is already approved in combination with Kaftrio. Nevertheless, these treatments do not cure 
the disease, and more efficacious treatments could fulfil this gap in these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence for the efficacy of Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio was presented in the initial 
Marketing Authorisation Application, for heterozygous patients with minimal function mutations in 
study 102 (F/MF) and for homozygous patients in study 103 (F/F); and the follow-up study 105. The 
main evidence for the extension of the indication to a broad population of CF patients with at least one 
F508del allele is obtained from one clinical trial, study 104, where heterozygous patients with 
additional type of mutations are studies i.e. patients with gating mutations (F/G) and patients with 
residual function mutations (F/RF). 
Study 104 in CF patients 12 years and older is an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, controlled study 
in subjects heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and 
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 74/81 
 
 
 
F/RF genotypes respectively). A total of 258 subjects received at least one dose of study drug. 
Ivacaftor was used as control treatment in patients with an F/G genotype and tezacaftor/ivacaftor in 
patients with an F/RF genotype. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline though in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (within-group change). 
Percent predicted FEV1 as a surrogate endpoint is well-established, and an improvement over time in 
this endpoint is related to improved lung function as lung disease is one of the main drivers of morbi-
mortality in patients with CF. Pulmonary exacerbations have also an impact on survival in cystic 
fibrosis and reduce health-related quality of life. Preservation of lung function alongside reductions of 
the rate of pulmonary exacerbations are one of the main goals of treatment of CF. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
CF patients included in study 104 (both F/G and RF) 
In study 104, the mean absolute within-group change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 in the 
ELX/IVA/TEZ group was 3.7 pp (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; p<0.0001). The absolute change in ppFEV1 
compared to the control group was a key secondary endpoint. The result of this analysis was 
consistent with the within-group changes (3.5 pp; 95% CI: 2.2, 4.7; p<0.0001). 
The mean absolute within-group change in SwCl (mmol/L) from baseline through week 8 of 
ELX/IVA/TEZ was -22.3 (-24.5; -20.2; p<0.0001). The SwCl comparison with the control group 
resulted in a reduction of 23.1 mmol/L (-26.1; -20.1; p<0.0001). 
For the respiratory domain (RD) score of CFQ-R, the within-group difference was an increase in score 
of 10.3 points (8.0, 12.7; nominal p<0.0001) and compared to the control group the treatment with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA resulted in an increase of 8.7 points (5.3, 12.1; nominal p<0.0001). 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the multiple imputation method to assess for impact of 
missing data; and results were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Consistent and significant benefits in ppFEV1 favouring ELX/TEZ/IVA were observed across all 
prespecified subgroups: age, sex, comparator group, baseline lung function, and geographic region. 
In all cases, the percentage of responders (ppFEV ≥ 2.5%, SwCL <30 mmol/L, CFQ-R RD change ≥ 4 
points) was higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the control group, and the differences between 
the treatment groups were substantial. 
CF patients 12 year and older with F/G genotype 
Ad-hoc subgroup analyses were performed in the comparator subgroups, which are based on the two 
different genotypes included in the study. In the F/G population, the between-group difference showed 
a beneficial change of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in ppFEV1 of 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0; 
nominal p<0.0001), in SwCL of -20.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -25.4, -14.6; nominal p<0.0001) and in CFQ-
RD of 8.9 points (95% CI: 3.8, 14.0; nominal p=0.0008) compared to IVA monotherapy. 
CF patients 12 years and older with F/RF genotype 
The patients with an F/RF genotype were also analysed as an ad-hoc subgroup. The between-group 
difference showed a beneficial change of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in ppFEV1 of 2.0 percentage points 
(0.5, 3.4; nominal p=0.0093), in SwCL of -24.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -28.4, -21.2; nominal p<0.0001) 
and in CFQ-RD of 8.5 points (4.0, 13.1; nominal p=0.0003) compared to TEZ/IVA combination 
therapy. 
Several additional analyses were provided, being COVID-19 sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses 
per comparator subgroup, analyses based on experienced or naïve CFTR modulator patients, and 
Assessment report

Page 75/81 
 
 
 
analyses in subsets of specific mutations. Also, more recent registry data were provided. All these 
additional analyses resulted in consistent outcomes compared to the outcomes as presented above.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
CF patients included in study 104 (both F/G and F/RF)  
The study was not powered for between-group comparisons, but a formal between-group comparison 
was made. The subgroup analyses for the F/G and F/RF genotypes separately are performed ad-hoc. 
Efficacy data are based on study 104 of 8 weeks duration. Long-term efficacy data are provided based 
on the supportive study 110 but remain overall limited.  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, also home assessments of FEV1 and CFQ-R were permitted. This 
introduces limitations, but the approach is reasonable based on the unforeseen circumstances.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally well tolerated; 88 (66.7%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 83 
(65.9%) subjects in the control group experienced at least one AE, with only five (3.8%) subjects in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 4 (3.2%) subjects in the control group had severe AEs. 
The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were headache, ALT 
increased, AST increased, and abdominal pain. The most common AEs (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
in the control group were headache, cough, infective PEx of CF, nausea, sputum increased, and 
diarrhoea. 
Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 11 (8.7%) subjects in the control group had SAEs. 
Infective PEx of CF occurred in 2 (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 7 (5.6%) subjects in 
the control group; all other SAEs occurred in no more than one subject per treatment group. There 
were no life-threatening AEs and no deaths. 
One (0.8%) subject in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs that led to study drug discontinuation (ALT 
increased and AST increased), and 2 (1.6%) subjects in the control group had AEs that led to study 
drug discontinuation (1 subject with an SAE of infective PEx of CF and 1 subject with SAEs in the SOC 
of psychiatric disorders). Five (3.8%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (2.4%) subjects in the 
control group had AEs that led to treatment interruption.  
Rash events (AESI of rash) occurred in 4 (3.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 5 (4.0%) 
subjects in the control group. All rash events in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group were mild or moderate in 
severity. 
Eight (6.1%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and one (0.8%) subject in the control group had an 
AESI of elevated transaminases; the majority of events were mild or moderate in severity, and none 
were SAEs. One (0.8%) subject discontinued ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment due to AEs of ALT increased and 
AST increased. 
In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 4 (3.2%), 1 (0.8%), and 1 
(0.8%) subject(s), respectively. In the control group, ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 2 
(1.6%), 1 (0.8%), and 0 subject(s), respectively. o No subject had ALT or AST >3 × ULN with 
concurrent total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. 
Two (1.5%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group had AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. 
Neither AE was serious or resulted in ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 76/81 
 
 
 
Mean SBP and DBP increased in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. The largest mean (SD) increase in SBP from 
baseline was 3.0 (12.4) mm Hg (at Week 8) and the largest mean (SD) increase in DBP was 2.5 (8.9) 
mm Hg (at Week 8). No subjects had AEs related to increase blood pressure. 
A total of 9 adolescents were enrolled in the control group and 15 adolescents in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group. The safety was generally consistent with the overall study population.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Study 104 provides safety data on ELX/TEZ/IVA in F/G and F/RF patients up to 8 weeks. There are no 
further data provided with this variation application regarding longer term safety. However there are 
controlled safety data from Study 102 (in F/MF) up to week 24 and Study 105 open label extension IA 
data (both F/F and F/MF) which were provided in the initial submission (271 subjects had an exposure 
of ≥48 weeks); these can be used to support the longer term safety in patients with F/G and F/RF 
genotypes. Additionally, the MAH was requested to amend the planned post-authorisation safety study 
(category 3) to include patients with F/RF and F/G mutation in order to further characterise safety in 
the post-approval setting.  
Study 104 is unusual in that both F/G and F/RF genotypes were combined and randomised as one 
group. No comparison of safety between F/G and F/RF genotypes has been provided. However, there is 
an overall low incidence of severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to low discontinuation across both the 
combined treatment group and combined control group, and no life-threatening AEs or AEs leading to 
death in either group. Therefore, it is considered that a subgroup analysis by genotype group (F/G and 
F/RF) for safety would be of limited value. The safety data and AE profile from the combined F/G and 
F/RF group are also consistent with those in both F/F and F/MF genotype groups, and it is not 
anticipated that there would be a difference in safety in F/G versus F/RF genotypes.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The submitted F/any indication is based on the hypothesis that Kaftrio in combination with Kalydeco 
mainly acts though the F508del allele and that all patients with an F508del allele could be included in 
the indication. During the assessment of the Kaftrio initial marketing authorisation application, the 
effects in the F/MF population and all additionally provided information made it reasonable, but not 
definitively conclusive that the ELX/TEZ/IVA mainly acts through the F508del allele and would result in 
a benefit in all patients with at least one F508del allele. Therefore, a study in F/RF or F/G patients was 
required to determine the added benefit of the triple combination in combination with IVA over 
approved IVA and TEZ/IVA and to further assess the above-mentioned hypothesis. Clinical data from 
study 104 are provided to support this application in the F/G and F/RF CF patients for whom other 
CFTR modulators are already approved.  
According to the MAH, if a modulator has a large effect on the F508del-CFTR, then the presence of a 
single F508del allele would be sufficient to derive a clinical benefit. This would mean that efficacy for 
non-tested populations of F/MF, F/RF and F/G should in principle be extrapolated.  
Importance of the favourable effects 
The observed difference of 3.5 percentage points (p<0.0001) between ELX/TEZ/IVA and the control 
treatment in an absolute change of ppFEV1 is well above the predefined threshold (3%, to have >99% 
of power).  
Separate F/G and F/RF efficacy outcomes are important to determine as these populations usually 
have a different CF severity and because the standard CFTR modulator is different. In F/G patients and 
F/RF patients a difference of 5.8 percentage points (p<0.0001) and 2.0 percentage points (p<0.0093) 
were seen compared to IVA and TEZ/IVA, respectively. 
Considering the natural evolution of the disease in CF patients in study 104, the observed effect is 
considered clinically relevant. 
Strength of the evidence 
Consistent improvements in ppFEV1 favouring ELX/TEZ/IVA were observed across the prespecified 
subgroups. The results of the primary parameter are supported by all key secondary parameters. CFQ-
R respiratory domain and sweat chloride both showed improvements above the Minimum Clinically 
Important Difference (MCID). Also, in the comparator subgroups (F/RF and F/G populations) the CFQ-R 
respiratory domain and sweat chloride both showed improvements well above the MCID. 
Impact of the uncertainties 
The comparator subgroups were tested ad-hoc, but still able to provide a good effect size for the 
efficacy parameters over the control groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206661/2021  
Page 78/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall clinical benefit seen on ppFEV1, SwCL and CFQ-R with ELX/TEZ/IVA in the F/RF and F/G 
patients has such a large effects sizes, that it is unlikely that uncertainties related to for example 
sensitivity analyses and previous modulator use will affect the data in such an extent that this benefit 
could be questioned. 
The study duration was only 8-weeks. However, the sustained effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA has been 
sufficiently shown in study 102 and the long-term open-label extension study 105 in the Kaftrio initial 
MAA. 
Safety 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated for 8 weeks.  
The safety results appeared consistent with the safety established in the clinical development program 
in the initial ELX/TEZ/IVA MAA. No new safety concerns were identified, but the number of the new 
safety set is relatively small. The planned PASS, which will also include patients with F/RF and F/G 
mutations, is expected to provide further safety data in the broad indication.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the overall population (F/G and F/RF), a clinical benefit is demonstrated for the primary and 
secondary endpoints. Due to differences in severity and standard of care, the two separate 
subpopulations (F/RF and F/G) are considered equally important.  
For CF patients with the F/G genotype, the IVA-controlled part of the study provided efficacy data that 
demonstrate that ELX/TEZ/IVA provides a substantial clinical benefit, both in the primary and the key 
secondary endpoints. The results are considered robust and clinically relevant. 
For CF patients with the F/RF genotype, the TEZ/IVA controlled part of the study provided efficacy data 
demonstrating substantial clinical benefit of ELX/TEZ/IVA both in the primary and the key secondary 
endpoints. These results can be regarded as clinically relevant.  
To identify the robustness of the effect and see whether different gating and residual function 
mutations might influence the effect size, it was of interest to see the clinical benefit in a subset based 
on specific mutations. In study 104, patients representing a total of 24 mutations (F/RF and F/G) were 
recruited, 12 F/RFs and 7 F/Gs were represented (with at least one patient) in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment group; the remaining 5 were treated with appropriate control. Information on additional 
mutations were also provided from study 110 and the real-world effectiveness registry data. For 
almost all of the genotypes included in both the F/G and F/RF categories, a clinical benefit is observed, 
and in most cases, it can be considered clinically meaningful. Overall, the CHMP considered that the 
totality of the data provides sufficient information on patients with F/RF and F/G mutations but also to 
conclude that Kalydeco in combination with Kaftrio provides efficacy in patients with at least one 
F508del mutation.  
Overall the safety profile is consistent with that seen in F/F and F/MF patients, and therefore 
acceptable in F/F and F/RF patients.    
Kalydeco is currently approved in combination with Kaftrio for F/F and F/MF mutations and 
demonstration of efficacy has been demonstrated in F/RF and F/G patients as discussed in this 
application. The CHMP therefore considered the broad indication approvable: 
Kalydeco tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor /tezacaftor /elexacaftor tablets 
for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have 
at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (see section 5.1).

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Extension of indication for Kalydeco (ivacaftor) tablets in combination regimen with Kaftrio 
(ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) tablets for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, 
regardless of the second allele, based on the results of Study VX18-445-104 in CF patients 12 years 
and older. This is an 8-week randomized, double-blind, controlled study in subjects heterozygous for 
the F508del mutation and a gating or residual function mutation (F/G and F/RF genotypes). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. The RMP is updated to Version 11.0. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.1. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0163/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to TOBI Podhaler, Bronchitol, 
Symkevi and Kaftrio within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See 
appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR

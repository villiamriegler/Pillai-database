Summary of risk management plan for Mylotarg (GO)
This is a summary of the RMP for Mylotarg.  The RMP details important risks of Mylotarg, how 
these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Mylotarg's risks 
and uncertainties (missing information).
Mylotarg's SmPC and its PL give essential information to HCPs and patients on how Mylotarg
should be used.
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Mylotarg’s 
RMP.
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) 
for the treatment of patients aged 15 years and older with previously untreated, de novo CD33-
positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL).
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise
the Risks
Important risks of Mylotarg, together with measures to minimise such risks for learning more 
about Mylotarg’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Mylotarg is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Mylotarg are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Mylotarg.  Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine):

Summary of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important Identified Risk: Severe (Grade ≥3) and/or Serious Hepatotoxicity Including All VOD/SOS
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and 
risk groups
Severe and/or serious hepatotoxicity, including severe or fatal hepatic VOD/SOS, has been 
reported in GO clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting.
Based on an analysis across trials, the risk of VOD was higher in adult patients who 
received higher doses of GO as monotherapy, in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment prior to receiving GO, in patients treated with GO after HSCT, and in patients 
who underwent HSCT after treatment with GO.

Important Identified Risk: Myelosuppression
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
In clinical trials, myelosuppression, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and 
pancytopenia, some of which were life-threatening or fatal, were reported in almost 73% of 
patients receiving GO. Clinical sequelae in the ALFA-0701 study of myelosuppression, 
including infections and bleeding/haemorrhagic events were reported frequently, some of 
which were life-threatening or fatal.
Patients with previously untreated de novo AML may have myelosuppression due to the 
presence of disease in the bone marrow.

Important Identified Risk: Tumour Lysis Syndrome
Evidence for

Risk factors and
risk groups
In first relapse GO monotherapy studies, TLS was reported although no events were fatal. 
Although the frequency was relatively low, fatal reports of TLS complicated by acute renal 
failure have been reported in the post marketing setting.
Patients with AML are at risk of developing TLS. These abnormalities may occur 
spontaneously before the initiation of chemotherapy due to increased catabolism and the 
turn-over of leukemic cells, but more frequently TLS is induced by intensive 
chemotherapy.  Additional risk factors include high tumour burden/high WBC count and 
high sensitivity to chemotherapy.

Risk minimisation
measures
In first relapse GO monotherapy studies, infusion related reactions, including anaphylaxis 
were reported. There have been reports of fatal infusion reactions in the postmarketing 
setting.
Patients with a known hypersensitivity to GO may be at an increased risk of developing an 
infusion-related reaction related to GO.

Important Potential Risk: Renal Toxicity
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and 
risk groups
Although Renal Toxicity has not been identified as a risk from clinical trials or in the post-
marketing setting, it was observed in non-clinical studies with GO in rats and monkeys.
Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of renal toxicity include 
tumour lysis syndrome in association with treatment of AML, other drugs, advanced age, 
hemodynamic status, and underlying renal disease.

Important Potential Risk: Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity (Post Exposure During Pregnancy, 
Including Breastfeeding)
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and 
risk groups
GO was associated with toxicity in embryo-foetal nonclinical studies.  GO is genotoxic and 
can potentially cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
Based on findings in animals and the known mechanism of action of GO, male and female 
fertility may be compromised by treatment with GO and GO treatment can cause foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  The risks to breastfeeding are not known.

Summary of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important Potential Risk: Neurotoxicity
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
Nervous system alterations have been identified after repeat doses in non-clinical studies in 
rats with other antibody-calicheamicin conjugates. Therefore, this important potential risk 
may represent be a class effect of antibody-drug conjugate drugs, although no risk has been 
identified in GO clinical studies and in the postmarketing setting.
Factors that could potentially be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity include 
chemotherapy, diabetes, drug abuse, heavy metal exposure, pesticides, solvents, organic or 
organometal compounds, and radiation exposure.

Important Potential Risk: Second Primary Malignancy
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
In non-clinical studies with GO in rats, microscopic findings included oval cell hyperplasia 
in the liver that were considered to be preneoplastic in nature.  Second primary malignancy 
has been observed with other antibody-calicheamicin conjugates in non-clinical settings. 
However, GO related events of second primary malignancy have not been identified in GO 
clinical studies or in the postmarketing setting.
Patients with prior or ongoing malignancies and those exposed to chemotherapy, radiation 
or other significant immunosuppressive therapies may be at higher risk for development of 
additional malignancies.

Important Potential Risk: Off-Label Use in Paediatric Patients
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine
There is evidence suggesting that GO may provide benefit to children with AML. Overall, 
results from the COG AAML 0531 study have shown improvement in event-free survival 
(EFS) with a similar safety profile as the adult population when GO is combined with 
intensive first-line therapy at lower doses.
No specific group within the paediatric population.

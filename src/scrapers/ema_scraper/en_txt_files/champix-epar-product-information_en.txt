1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each film-coated tablet contains 0.5 mg of varenicline (as tartrate). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet of 4 mm x 8 mm 
White, capsular-shaped, biconvex tablets debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “CHX 0.5” on the 
other side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CHAMPIX is indicated for smoking cessation in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: 
Days 1 – 3: 
Days 4 – 7: 
Day 8 – End of treatment:  1 mg twice daily 
0.5 mg once daily 
0.5 mg twice daily 
The patient should set a date to stop smoking. CHAMPIX dosing should usually start at 1-2 weeks 
before this date (see section 5.1). Patients should be treated with CHAMPIX for 12 weeks. 
For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 
12 weeks treatment with CHAMPIX at 1 mg twice daily may be considered for the maintenance of 
abstinence (see section 5.1).  
A gradual approach to quitting smoking with CHAMPIX should be considered for patients who are 
not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of 
treatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. Patients should then continue taking CHAMPIX 
for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). 
Patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior 
CHAMPIX therapy, or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another quit attempt with 
CHAMPIX (see section 5.1). 
Patients who cannot tolerate adverse reactions of CHAMPIX may have the dose lowered temporarily 
or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily.

In smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately 
following the end of treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be considered 
(see section 4.4).  
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Because elderly patients are 
more likely to have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider the renal status of an elderly 
patient. 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min 
and ≤ 80 ml/min) to moderate (estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 50 ml/min) renal 
impairment. 
For patients with moderate renal impairment who experience adverse reactions that are not tolerable, 
dosing may be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  
For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the 
recommended dose of CHAMPIX is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily for 
the first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based on insufficient clinical experience with 
CHAMPIX in patients with end stage renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient 
population (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
CHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this population 
was not demonstrated (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Method of administration 
CHAMPIX is for oral use and the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. 
CHAMPIX can be taken with or without food 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Effect of smoking cessation 
Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHAMPIX, 
may alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which dosage 
adjustment may be necessary (examples include theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking 
induces CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates. 
Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
Changes in behaviour or thinking, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, aggressive behaviour, depression, 
suicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts have been reported in patients attempting to quit 
smoking with CHAMPIX in the post-marketing experience.  
A large randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare 
the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients with and without a history of psychiatric 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disorder treated for smoking cessation with varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy 
patch (NRT) or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neuropsychiatric adverse 
events that have been reported in post-marketing experience.  
The use of varenicline in patients with or without a history of psychiatric disorder was not associated 
with an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events in the composite primary endpoint 
compared with placebo (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Study in Subjects with and 
without a History of Psychiatric Disorder).  
Depressed mood, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, may be a symptom of nicotine 
withdrawal. 
Clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
patients attempting to quit smoking with or without treatment. If serious neuropsychiatric symptoms 
occur whilst on varenicline treatment, patients should discontinue varenicline immediately and 
contact a healthcare professional for re-evaluation of treatment. 
History of psychiatric disorders 
Smoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has been associated with exacerbation of 
underlying psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). 
CHAMPIX smoking cessation studies have provided data in patients with a history of psychiatric 
disorders (see section 5.1).  
In a smoking cessation clinical trial, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported more frequently in 
patients with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to those without a history of psychiatric 
disorders, regardless of treatment (see section 5.1). 
Care should be taken with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients should be 
advised accordingly. 
Seizures 
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience there have been reports of seizures in patients with or 
without a history of seizures, treated with CHAMPIX. CHAMPIX should be used cautiously in 
patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold.  
Treatment discontinuation 
At the end of treatment, discontinuation of CHAMPIX was associated with an increase in irritability, 
urge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The prescriber should inform the 
patient accordingly and discuss or consider the need for dose tapering. 
Cardiovascular events 
Patients taking CHAMPIX should be instructed to notify their doctor of new or worsening 
cardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and 
symptoms of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 5.1). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients 
treated with varenicline. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), 
neck (throat and larynx) and extremities. There were rare reports of life-threatening angioedema 
requiring urgent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Patients experiencing these 
4 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms should discontinue treatment with varenicline and contact a health care provider 
immediately. 
Cutaneous reactions 
There have also been post-marketing reports of rare but severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme in patients using varenicline. As these skin reactions can 
be life threatening, patients should discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash or skin reaction and 
contact a healthcare provider immediately. 
Excipient information 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHAMPIX has no clinically 
meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of CHAMPIX or co-administered medicinal 
products listed below is recommended. 
In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that 
are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active 
substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
varenicline (see section 5.2) and therefore a dose adjustment of CHAMPIX would not be required. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at 
therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion (e.g., 
metformin - see below) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline.  
Metformin  
Varenicline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Metformin had no effect on varenicline 
pharmacokinetics. 
Cimetidine 
Co-administration of cimetidine, with varenicline increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by 
29% due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. No dosage adjustment is recommended based 
on concomitant cimetidine administration in subjects with normal renal function or in patients with 
mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the concomitant use of 
cimetidine and varenicline should be avoided. 
Digoxin  
Varenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. 
Warfarin  
Varenicline did not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected 
by varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics (see 
section 4.4). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alcohol  
There are limited clinical data on any potential interaction between alcohol and varenicline. There 
have been post marketing reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients treated with 
varenicline. A causal relationship between these events and varenicline use has not been established. 
Use with other therapies for smoking cessation  
Bupropion  
Varenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion. 
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
When varenicline and transdermal NRT were co-administered to smokers for 12 days, there was a 
statistically significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure (mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the 
final day of the study. In this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, 
and fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. 
Safety and efficacy of CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not 
been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women indicated no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity 
of varenicline (see section 5.1). 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of varenicline during pregnancy (see section 5.1). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether varenicline is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that 
varenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or 
to continue/discontinue therapy with CHAMPIX should be made taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of CHAMPIX therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of varenicline on fertility. 
Non-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on standard male and female fertility studies in 
the rat (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CHAMPIX may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
CHAMPIX may cause dizziness, somnolence and transient loss of consciousness, and therefore may 
influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex 
machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal 
product affects their ability to perform these activities.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Smoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with various symptoms. For example, 
dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia, irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty 
concentrating; restlessness; decreased heart rate; increased appetite or weight gain have been reported 
in patients attempting to stop smoking. No attempt has been made in either the design or the analysis 
of the CHAMPIX studies to distinguish between adverse reactions associated with study drug 
treatment or those possibly associated with nicotine withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions are based on 
evaluation of data from pre-marketing phase 2-3 studies and updated based on pooled data from 
18 placebo-controlled pre- and post-marketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated 
with varenicline. 
In patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following an initial titration period 
the adverse event most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the majority of cases nausea 
occurred early in the treatment period, was mild to moderate in severity and seldom resulted in 
discontinuation. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
In the table below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo are listed 
by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)). Within each frequency grouping, 
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose were reported in pre-marketing clinical trials. 
In case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required. 
Varenicline has been shown to be dialyzed in patients with end stage renal disease (see section 5.2), 
however, there is no experience in dialysis following overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; Drugs used in addictive disorders; Drugs 
used in nicotine dependence, ATC code: N07BA03 
Mechanism of action 
Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors, where it acts as a partial agonist - a compound that has both agonist activity, with lower 
intrinsic efficacy than nicotine, and antagonist activities in the presence of nicotine. 
Electrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline 
binds to the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, 
but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Nicotine competes for the same human α4β2 nAChR 
binding site for which varenicline has higher affinity. Therefore, varenicline can effectively block 
nicotine's ability to fully activate α4β2 receptors and the mesolimbic dopamine system, the neuronal 
mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly 
selective and binds more potently to the α4β2 receptor subtype (Ki=0.15 nM) than to other common 
nicotinic receptors (α3β4 Ki=84 nM, α7 Ki= 620 nM, α1βγδ Ki= 3,400 nM), or to non-nicotinic 
receptors and transporters (Ki > 1µM, except to 5-HT3 receptors: Ki=350 nM). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation is a result of varenicline's partial agonist activity at 
the α4β2 nicotinic receptor where its binding produces an effect sufficient to alleviate symptoms of 
craving and withdrawal (agonist activity), while simultaneously resulting in a reduction of the 
rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine binding to α4β2 receptors 
(antagonist activity). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Smoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop 
smoking and who are provided with additional advice and support. 
The efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation was demonstrated in 3 clinical trials involving 
chronic cigarette smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes per day). Two thousand six hundred nineteen 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2619) patients received CHAMPIX 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week), 669 patients received 
bupropion 150 mg BID (also titrated) and 684 patients received placebo. 
Comparative clinical studies 
Two identical double-blind clinical trials prospectively compared the efficacy of CHAMPIX (1 mg 
twice daily), sustained release bupropion (150 mg twice daily) and placebo in smoking cessation. In 
these 52 week duration studies, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40 week 
non-treatment phase. 
The primary endpoint of the two studies was the carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed, 4 week continuous 
quit rate (4W-CQR) from week 9 through week 12. The primary endpoint for CHAMPIX 
demonstrated statistical superiority to bupropion and placebo. 
After the 40 week non-treatment phase, a key secondary endpoint for both studies was the Continuous 
Abstinence Rate (CA) at week 52. CA was defined as the proportion of all subjects treated who did 
not smoke (not even a puff of a cigarette) from Week 9 through Week 52 and did not have an exhaled 
CO measurement of > 10 ppm. 
The 4W-CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) from studies 1 and 2 are 
included in the following table:

Patient reported craving, withdrawal and reinforcing effects of smoking 
Across both Studies 1 and 2 during active treatment, craving and withdrawal were significantly 
reduced in patients randomised to CHAMPIX in comparison with placebo. CHAMPIX also 
significantly reduced reinforcing effects of smoking that can perpetuate smoking behaviour in patients 
who smoke during treatment compared with placebo. The effect of varenicline on craving, withdrawal 
and reinforcing effects of smoking were not measured during the non-treatment long-term follow-up 
phase. 
Maintenance of abstinence study 
The third study assessed the benefit of an additional 12 weeks of CHAMPIX therapy on the 
maintenance of abstinence. Patients in this study (n=1,927) received open-label CHAMPIX 1 mg 
twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who stopped smoking by Week 12 were then randomised to receive 
either CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks for a total study duration 
of 52 weeks. 
The primary study endpoint was the CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 13 through 
week 24 in the double-blind treatment phase. A key secondary endpoint was the continuous abstinence 
(CA) rate for week 13 through week 52.  
This study showed the benefit of an additional 12-week treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily 
for the maintenance of smoking cessation compared to placebo; superiority to placebo for CA was 
maintained through week 52. The key results are summarised in the following table:

determine clinical efficacy. 
Flexible quit date between weeks 1 and 5 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline has been evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility of 
quitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. In this 24-week study, patients received treatment for 
12 weeks followed by a 12 week non-treatment follow up phase. The 4 week (week 9-12) CQR for 
varenicline and placebo was 53.9% and 19.4%, respectively (difference=34.5%, 95% CI: 
27.0% - 42.0%) and the CA week 9-24 was 35.2% (varenicline) vs. 12.7% (placebo) 
(difference=22.5%, 95% CI: 15.8% - 29.1%). Patients who are not willing or able to set the target quit 
date within 1-2 weeks, could be offered to start treatment and then choose their own quit date within 
5 weeks. 
Study in subjects re-treated with CHAMPIX  
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 494 patients who had made a 
previous attempt to quit smoking with CHAMPIX, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed 
after treatment. Subjects who experienced an adverse event of a concern during previous treatment 
were excluded. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo 
(N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for up to 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included 
in this study had taken CHAMPIX for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment 
duration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been 
smoking for at least four weeks.  
Patients treated with CHAMPIX had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 
through 12 and from weeks 9 through 52 compared to subjects treated with placebo. The key results 
are summarised in the following table:

Gradual approach to quitting smoking 
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 1,510 subjects who 
were not able or willing to quit smoking within four weeks, but were willing to gradually reduce their 
smoking over a 12 week period before quitting. Subjects were randomised to either CHAMPIX 1 mg 
twice daily (n=760) or placebo (n=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. 
Subjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end 
of the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to 
week eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with 
CHAMPIX had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo; the key

The CHAMPIX safety profile in this study was consistent with that of pre-marketing studies. 
Subjects with cardiovascular disease 
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with 
stable, cardiovascular disease (other than, or in addition to, hypertension) that had been diagnosed for 
more than 2 months. Subjects were randomised to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (n=353) or placebo 
(n=350) for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The 4 week CQR for 
varenicline and placebo was 47.3% and 14.3%, respectively and the CA week 9-52 was 19.8% 
(varenicline) vs. 7.4% (placebo). 
Deaths and serious cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, committee. The following 
adjudicated events occurred with a frequency ≥ 1% in either treatment group during treatment (or in 
the 30-day period after treatment): nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.1% vs. 0.3% for CHAMPIX and 
placebo, respectively), and hospitalisation for angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 1.1%). During non-treatment 
follow up to 52 weeks, the adjudicated events included need for coronary revascularisation (2.0% vs. 
0.6%), hospitalisation for angina pectoris (1.7% vs. 1.1%), and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular 
disease (PVD) or admission for a PVD procedure (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Some of the patients requiring 
coronary revascularisation underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and 
hospitalisation for angina. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.3% of patients in the CHAMPIX arm 
and 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm over the course of the 52-week study. 
A meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients 
(4190 CHAMPIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the cardiovascular safety of 
CHAMPIX. The study in patients with stable cardiovascular disease described above was included in 
the meta-analysis.  
The key cardiovascular safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and 
nonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent 
committee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred during treatment in the trials included in the 
meta-analysis (CHAMPIX 7 [0.17%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]). Additionally, a small number of MACE 
occurred up to 30 days after treatment (CHAMPIX 13 [0.31%]; placebo 6 [0.21%]).  
The meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHAMPIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE 
of 2.83 (95% confidence interval from 0.76 to 10.55, p=0.12) for patients during treatment 
and 1.95 (95% confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82, p=0.15) for patients up to 30 days after 
treatment. These are equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.5 MACE events and 6.3 MACE events 
per 1,000 patient-years, respectively of exposure. The hazard ratio for MACE was higher in patients 
with cardiovascular risk factors in addition to smoking compared with that in patients without 
cardiovascular risk factors other than smoking. There were similar rates of all-cause mortality 
(CHAMPIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and cardiovascular mortality (CHAMPIX 2 [0.05%]; 
placebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHAMPIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis.

Cardiovascular safety assessment study in subjects with and without a history of psychiatric disorder 
The cardiovascular (CV) safety of CHAMPIX was evaluated in the Study in Subjects with and without 
a History of Psychiatric Disorder (parent study; see section 5.1 - Neuropsychiatric safety) and its non-
treatment extension, the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Study, which enrolled 4595 of the 6293 
subjects who completed the parent study (N=8058) and followed them through week 52. Of all 
subjects treated in the parent study, 1749 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 644 (8.0%) had a high 
CV risk, as defined by Framingham score.  
The primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and 
cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. 
The following table shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios vs placebo for all treatment 
groups during treatment, and cumulative for treatment plus 30 days and through end of study.

The use of CHAMPIX, bupropion, and NRT was not associated with an increased risk of CV AEs in 
smokers treated for up to 12 weeks and followed for up to 1 year compared to placebo, although 
because of the relatively low number of events overall, an association cannot be entirely ruled out. 
Subjects with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
The efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for smoking cessation in subjects with  
mild-moderate COPD was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical 
trial. In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week 
non-treatment follow-up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-confirmed, 4-week 
Continuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was the 
Continuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through Week 52. The safety profile of varenicline was 
comparable to what was reported in other trials in the general population, including pulmonary safety.  
The results for the 4W CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) are shown in the 
following table:

Study in subjects with a history of major depressive disorder 
The efficacy of varenicline was confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled trial in 525 subjects 
with a history of major depression in the past two years or under current stable treatment. The 
cessation rates in this population were similar to those reported in the general population. Continuous 
abstinence rate between weeks 9-12 was 35.9% in the varenicline treatment group versus 15.6% in the 
placebo group (OR 3.35 (95% CI 2.16-5.21)) and between weeks 9-52 was 20.3% versus 10.4% 
respectively (OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.40-3.98)). The most common adverse events (≥ 10%) in subjects 
taking varenicline were nausea (27.0% vs. 10.4% on placebo), headache (16.8% vs. 11.2%), abnormal 
dreams (11.3% vs. 8.2%), insomnia (10.9% vs. 4.8%) and irritability (10.9% vs. 8.2%). Psychiatric 
scales showed no differences between the varenicline and placebo groups and no overall worsening of 
depression, or other psychiatric symptoms, during the study in either treatment group. 
Study in subjects with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  
Varenicline safety and tolerability was assessed in a double-blind study of 128 smokers with stable 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on antipsychotic medication, randomised 2:1 to varenicline 
(1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-drug follow-up. 
The most common adverse events in subjects taking varenicline were nausea (23.8% vs. 14.0% on 
placebo), headache (10.7% vs. 18.6% on placebo) and vomiting (10.7% vs. 9.3% on placebo). Among 
reported neuropsychiatric adverse events, insomnia was the only event reported in either treatment 
group in ≥ 5% of subjects at a rate higher in the varenicline group than in placebo  
(9.5% vs. 4.7%).  
Overall, there was no worsening of schizophrenia in either treatment group as measured by psychiatric 
scales and there were no overall changes in extra-pyramidal signs. In the varenicline group compared 
to placebo, a higher proportion of subjects reported suicidal ideation or behaviour prior to enrolment 
(lifetime history) and after the end of active treatment period (on Days 33 to 85 after the last dose of 
treatment). During the active treatment period, the incidence of suicide-related events was similar 
between the varenicline-treated and the placebo-treated subjects (11 vs. 9.3%, respectively). The 
percentage of subjects with suicide-related events in the active treatment phase compared to 
post-treatment phase was unchanged in the varenicline group; in the placebo group, this percentage 
was lower in the post-treatment phase. Although there were no completed suicides, there was one 
suicidal attempt in a varenicline-treated subject whose lifetime history included several similar 
attempts. The limited data available from this single smoking cessation study are not sufficient to 
allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the safety in patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder. 
Neuropsychiatric safety 
Study in Subjects with and without a History of Psychiatric Disorder: Varenicline was evaluated in a 
randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that included subjects with a history of 
psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4074) and subjects without a history of psychiatric 
disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3984). Subjects aged 18-75 years, smoking 10 or more cigarettes 
per day were randomised 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion SR 150 mg BID, nicotine 
replacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a treatment period of 12 weeks; 
they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.  
The primary safety endpoint was a composite of the following neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events: 
severe events of anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, or hostility, and/or moderate or severe events 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, 
psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour or completed suicide.

The rates of events in the composite endpoint were low across all treatment groups and were similar or 
lower for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. The use of varenicline, bupropion and 
NRT in the non-psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk of NPS 
adverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs were lower than 
or included zero). 
The percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based on the Columbia-Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar between the varenicline and placebo groups during 
treatment and in the non- treatment follow-up, as shown in the following table:

There were more events reported in patients in the psychiatric cohort in each treatment group 
compared with the non-psychiatric cohort, and the incidence of events in the composite endpoint 
was higher for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. However, the use of varenicline,

bupropion and NRT in the psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk 
of NPS adverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs

In the psychiatric cohort, the percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based 
on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar between the varenicline and

There were no completed suicides reported in the psychiatric cohort. 
The most commonly reported adverse events in subjects treated with varenicline in this study were 
similar to those observed in premarketing studies. 
In both cohorts, subjects treated with varenicline demonstrated statistical superiority of 
CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 and 9 through 24 compared to subjects 
treated with bupropion, nicotine patch and placebo (please see table below).

Neuropsychiatric Safety Meta-analyses and Observational Studies:  
Analyses of clinical trial data did not show evidence of an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric 
events with varenicline compared to placebo. In addition, independent observational studies have not 
supported an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline 
compared to patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion.  
Treatment discontinuation  
The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11.4% for varenicline compared with 
9.7% for placebo. In this group, the discontinuation rates for the most common adverse reactions in 
varenicline treated patients were as follows: nausea (2.7% vs. 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs. 
1.0% for placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs. 1.2% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.2% vs. 0.2% for 
placebo). 
Analyses of Clinical Trials:  
A meta-analysis of 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials, including 1907 patients 
(1130 varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported 
on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial 
(N=127) in patients with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial 
(N=525) in patients with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of 
suicidal ideation and/or behaviour in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated 
with placebo, as shown in the table below. Of the 55 patients who reported suicidal ideation or 
behaviour, 48 (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a history 
of schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder, or of depression. Few patients reported these events in the 
other three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo).

A meta-analysis of 18 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to 
assess the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. These trials included the 5 trials described above that 
used the C-SSRS, and a total of 8521 patients (5072 varenicline, 3449 placebo), some of which had 
psychiatric conditions. The results showed a similar incidence of combined neuropsychiatric adverse 
events, other than sleep disorders, in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated with 
placebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89-1.15). Pooled data from these 18 trials showed a 
similar incidence rate of individual categories of psychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline 
compared to patients treated with placebo. The table below describes the most frequently (≥ 1%) 
reported categories of adverse events related to psychiatric safety other than sleep disorders and 
disturbances.

Four observational studies, each including 10,000 to 30,000 users of varenicline in the adjusted 
analyses, compared the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events, including neuropsychiatric 
hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal self-harm, in patients treated with varenicline versus patients 
prescribed NRT or bupropion. All studies were retrospective cohort studies and included patients with 
and without a psychiatric history. All studies used statistical methods to control for confounding 
factors, including preferential prescribing of varenicline to healthier patients, although there is the 
possibility of residual confounding. 
Two of the studies found no difference in risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalisations between varenicline 
users and nicotine patch users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56-2.34 in 
the first study, and 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.46 in the second study). The power to detect differences in 
these two studies was limited. The third study reported no difference in risk of psychiatric adverse 
events diagnosed during an emergency department visit or inpatient admission between varenicline 
users and bupropion users (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55-1.30). Based on post marketing reports, bupropion 
may be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. 
The fourth study showed no evidence of a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal self- harm (HR of 0.88; 
95% CI: 0.52-1.49) in patients prescribed varenicline compared to patients prescribed NRT. The 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurrence of detected suicide was rare during the three months after patients initiated any drug 
treatment (two cases in 31,260 varenicline users and six cases in 81,545 NRT users). 
Pregnancy Cohort Study 
A population-based cohort study compared infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero (N=335) with 
infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and infants born to non-smoking 
mothers (N=806,438). In this study, infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero as compared to infants 
born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had lower rates of congenital malformations 
(3.6% vs 4.3%), stillbirth (0.3% vs 0.5%), preterm birth (7.5% vs 7.9%), small for gestational age 
(12.5% vs 17.1%), and premature rupture of membrane (3.6% vs 5.4%). 
Paediatric Population 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least 
5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the 
Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age 
and 17-19 years of age) and by body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, 
patients randomised to varenicline with a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose 
group) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received 
0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received 
treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate 
counseling throughout the study. 
The following table from the above paediatric study shows a comparison of continuous abstinence 
rates (CAR) from weeks 9-12, confirmed by urine cotinine test, for the full analysis set overall study

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Maximum plasma concentrations of varenicline occur typically within 3-4 hours after oral 
administration. Following administration of multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers, steady-state 
conditions were reached within 4 days. Absorption is virtually complete after oral administration and 
systemic availability is high. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day 
dosing. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Varenicline distributes into tissues, including the brain. Apparent volume of distribution averaged 
415 litres (%CV= 50) at steady-state. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (< 20%) and 
independent of both age and renal function. In rodents, varenicline is transferred through the placenta 
and excreted in milk.  
Biotransformation 
Varenicline undergoes minimal metabolism with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine and less than 
10% excreted as metabolites. Minor metabolites in urine include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide 
and hydroxyvarenicline. In circulation, varenicline comprises 91% of drug-related material. Minor 
circulating metabolites include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide and N-glucosylvarenicline. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(IC50 > 6,400 ng/ml). The P450 enzymes tested for inhibition were: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline was shown to not induce the 
activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. Therefore, varenicline is unlikely to alter the 
pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Renal elimination of varenicline is 
primarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion via the organic cationic 
transporter, OCT2 (see section 4.5). 
Linearity/Non linearity 
Varenicline exhibits linear kinetics when given as single (0.1 to 3 mg) or repeated 1 to 3 mg/day 
doses. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
There are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, 
gender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medicinal products, as demonstrated in specific 
pharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Hepatic impairment 
Due to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be 
unaffected in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment  
Varenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated 
creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min and ≤ 80 ml/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment 
(estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 50 ml/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold 
compared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). In 
subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), varenicline 
exposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), varenicline was 
efficiently removed by haemodialysis (see section 4.2).  
Elderly  
The pharmacokinetics of varenicline in elderly patients with normal renal function (aged 65-75 years) 
is similar to that of younger adult subjects (see section 4.2). For elderly patients with reduced renal 
function please refer to section 4.2. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in paediatric patients 
aged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg 
daily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight > 55 kg, 
as assessed by AUC (0-24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. 
When 0.5 mg twice daily was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher 
(by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight ≤ 55 kg compared to that noted in the 
adult population. CHAMPIX is not recommended in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this 
population was not demonstrated (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In male 
rats dosed for 2 years with varenicline, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of hibernoma 
(tumour of the brown fat). In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with varenicline there were 
decreases in fertility and increases in the auditory startle response (see section 4.6). These effects were 
observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure 
indicating little relevance to clinical use. Nonclinical data indicate varenicline has reinforcing 
properties albeit with lower potency than nicotine. In clinical studies in humans, varenicline showed 
low abuse potential.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CHAMPIX is indicated for smoking cessation in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: 
Days 1 – 3: 
Days 4 – 7: 
Day 8 – End of treatment:  1 mg twice daily 
0.5 mg once daily 
0.5 mg twice daily 
The patient should set a date to stop smoking. CHAMPIX dosing should usually start 1-2 weeks 
before this date (see section 5.1). Patients should be treated with CHAMPIX for 12 weeks. 
For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 
weeks treatment with CHAMPIX at 1 mg twice daily may be considered for the maintenance of 
abstinence (see section 5.1). 
A gradual approach to quitting smoking with CHAMPIX should be considered for patients who are 
not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of 
treatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. Patients should then continue taking CHAMPIX 
for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). 
Patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior 
CHAMPIX therapy, or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another quit attempt with 
CHAMPIX (see section 5.1). 
Patients who cannot tolerate adverse reactions of CHAMPIX may have the dose lowered temporarily 
or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately 
following the end of treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be considered 
(see section 4.4).  
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Because elderly patients are 
more likely to have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider the renal status of an elderly 
patient. 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min 
and ≤ 80 ml/min) to moderate (estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 50 ml/min) renal 
impairment. 
For patients with moderate renal impairment who experience adverse reactions that are not tolerable, 
dosing may be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  
For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the 
recommended dose of CHAMPIX is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily for 
the first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based on insufficient clinical experience with 
CHAMPIX in patients with end stage renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient 
population (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
CHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this population 
was not demonstrated (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Method of administration 
CHAMPIX is for oral use and the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. 
CHAMPIX can be taken with or without food 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Effect of smoking cessation 
Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHAMPIX, 
may alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which dosage 
adjustment may be necessary (examples include theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking 
induces CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates. 
Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
Changes in behaviour or thinking, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, aggressive behaviour, depression, 
suicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts have been reported in patients attempting to quit 
smoking with CHAMPIX in the post-marketing experience.  
A large randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare 
the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients with and without a history of psychiatric 
disorder treated for smoking cessation with varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patch (NRT) or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neuropsychiatric adverse 
events that have been reported in post-marketing experience.  
The use of varenicline in patients with or without a history of psychiatric disorder was not associated 
with an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events in the composite primary endpoint 
compared with placebo (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Study in Subjects with and 
without a History of Psychiatric Disorder).  
Depressed mood, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, may be a symptom of 
nicotine withdrawal. 
Clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
patients attempting to quit smoking with or without treatment. If serious neuropsychiatric symptoms 
occur whilst on varenicline treatment, patients should discontinue varenicline immediately and 
contact a healthcare professional for re-evaluation of treatment.  
History of psychiatric disorders 
Smoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has been associated with exacerbation of 
underlying psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). 
CHAMPIX smoking cessation studies have provided data in patients with a history of psychiatric 
disorders (see section 5.1).  
In a smoking cessation clinical trial, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported more frequently in 
patients with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to those without a history of psychiatric 
disorders, regardless of treatment (see section 5.1). 
Care should be taken with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients should be advised 
accordingly. 
Seizures 
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience there have been reports of seizures in patients with or 
without a history of seizures, treated with CHAMPIX. CHAMPIX should be used cautiously in 
patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold.  
Treatment discontinuation 
At the end of treatment, discontinuation of CHAMPIX was associated with an increase in irritability, 
urge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The prescriber should inform the 
patient accordingly and discuss or consider the need for dose tapering. 
Cardiovascular events 
Patients taking CHAMPIX should be instructed to notify their doctor of new or worsening 
cardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and 
symptoms of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 5.1). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients 
treated with varenicline. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), 
neck (throat and larynx) and extremities. There were rare reports of life-threatening angioedema 
requiring urgent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Patients experiencing these 
symptoms should discontinue treatment with varenicline and contact a health care provider 
immediately.  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cutaneous reactions 
There have also been post-marketing reports of rare but severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme in patients using varenicline. As these skin reactions can 
be life threatening, patients should discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash or skin reaction and 
contact a healthcare provider immediately. 
Excipient information 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHAMPIX has no clinically 
meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of CHAMPIX or co-administered medicinal 
products listed below is recommended. 
In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that 
are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active 
substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
varenicline (see section 5.2) and therefore a dose adjustment of CHAMPIX would not be required. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at 
therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion  
(e.g., metformin - see below) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline.  
Metformin 
Varenicline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Metformin had no effect on varenicline 
pharmacokinetics. 
Cimetidine 
Co-administration of cimetidine, with varenicline increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by 
29% due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. No dosage adjustment is recommended based 
on concomitant cimetidine administration in subjects with normal renal function or in patients with 
mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the concomitant use of 
cimetidine and varenicline should be avoided. 
Digoxin 
Varenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. 
Warfarin 
Varenicline did not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected 
by varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics (see 
section 4.4). 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alcohol 
There are limited clinical data on any potential interaction between alcohol and varenicline. There 
have been post marketing reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients treated with 
varenicline. A causal relationship between these events and varenicline use has not been established. 
Use with other therapies for smoking cessation  
Bupropion 
Varenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion. 
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
When varenicline and transdermal NRT were co-administered to smokers for 12 days, there was a 
statistically significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure (mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the 
final day of the study. In this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, 
and fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. 
Safety and efficacy of CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not 
been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women indicated no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity 
of varenicline (see section 5.1). 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of varenicline during pregnancy (see section 5.1). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether varenicline is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that 
varenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or 
to continue/discontinue therapy with CHAMPIX should be made taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of CHAMPIX therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of varenicline on fertility. 
Non-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on standard male and female fertility studies in 
the rat (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CHAMPIX may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
CHAMPIX may cause dizziness, somnolence and transient loss of consciousness, and therefore may 
influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex 
machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal 
product affects their ability to perform these activities.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Smoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with various symptoms. For example, 
dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia, irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty 
concentrating; restlessness; decreased heart rate; increased appetite or weight gain have been reported 
in patients attempting to stop smoking. No attempt has been made in either the design or the analysis 
of the CHAMPIX studies to distinguish between adverse reactions associated with study drug 
treatment or those possibly associated with nicotine withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions are based on 
evaluation of data from pre-marketing phase 2-3 studies and updated based on pooled data from 
18 placebo-controlled pre- and post-marketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated 
with varenicline. 
In patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following an initial titration period 
the adverse event most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the majority of cases nausea 
occurred early in the treatment period, was mild to moderate in severity and seldom resulted in 
discontinuation. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
In the table below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo are listed 
by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)). Within each frequency grouping, 
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose were reported in pre-marketing clinical trials. 
In case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required. 
Varenicline has been shown to be dialyzed in patients with end stage renal disease (see section 5.2), 
however, there is no experience in dialysis following overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; Drugs used in addictive disorders, Drugs 
used in nicotine dependence, ATC code: N07BA03 
Mechanism of action 
Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors, where it acts as a partial agonist - a compound that has both agonist activity, with lower 
intrinsic efficacy than nicotine, and antagonist activities in the presence of nicotine.  
Electrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline 
binds to the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, 
but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Nicotine competes for the same human α4β2 nAChR 
binding site for which varenicline has higher affinity. Therefore, varenicline can effectively block 
nicotine's ability to fully activate α4β2 receptors and the mesolimbic dopamine system, the neuronal 
mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly 
selective and binds more potently to the α4β2 receptor subtype (Ki=0.15 nM) than to other common 
nicotinic receptors (α3β4 Ki=84 nM, α7 Ki= 620 nM, α1βγδ Ki= 3,400 nM), or to non-nicotinic 
receptors and transporters (Ki > 1µM, except to 5-HT3 receptors: Ki=350 nM). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation is a result of varenicline's partial agonist activity at 
the α4β2 nicotinic receptor where its binding produces an effect sufficient to alleviate symptoms of 
craving and withdrawal (agonist activity), while simultaneously resulting in a reduction of the 
rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine binding to α4β2 receptors 
(antagonist activity). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Smoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop 
smoking and who are provided with additional advice and support. 
The efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation was demonstrated in 3 clinical trials involving 
chronic cigarette smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes per day). Two thousand six hundred nineteen (2619) 
patients received CHAMPIX 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week), 669 patients received 
bupropion 150 mg BID (also titrated) and 684 patients received placebo. 
Comparative clinical studies 
Two identical double-blind clinical trials prospectively compared the efficacy of CHAMPIX  
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1 mg twice daily), sustained release bupropion (150 mg twice daily) and placebo in smoking 
cessation. In these 52-week duration studies, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 
40-week non-treatment phase. 
The primary endpoint of the two studies was the carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed, 4-week 
continuous quit rate (4W-CQR) from week 9 through week 12. The primary endpoint for CHAMPIX 
demonstrated statistical superiority to bupropion and placebo. 
After the 40 week non-treatment phase, a key secondary endpoint for both studies was the Continuous 
Abstinence Rate (CA) at week 52. CA was defined as the proportion of all subjects treated who did 
not smoke (not even a puff of a cigarette) from Week 9 through Week 52 and did not have an exhaled 
CO measurement of > 10 ppm. The 4W-CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) 
from studies 1 and 2 are included in the following table:

Patient reported craving, withdrawal and reinforcing effects of smoking 
Across both Studies 1 and 2 during active treatment, craving and withdrawal were significantly 
reduced in patients randomised to CHAMPIX in comparison with placebo. CHAMPIX also 
significantly reduced reinforcing effects of smoking that can perpetuate smoking behaviour in patients 
who smoke during treatment compared with placebo. The effect of varenicline on craving, withdrawal 
and reinforcing effects of smoking were not measured during the non-treatment long-term follow-up 
phase. 
Maintenance of abstinence study 
The third study assessed the benefit of an additional 12 weeks of CHAMPIX therapy on the 
maintenance of abstinence. Patients in this study (n=1,927) received open-label CHAMPIX 1 mg 
twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who stopped smoking by Week 12 were then randomised to receive 
either CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks for a total study duration 
of 52 weeks. 
The primary study endpoint was the CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 13 through 
week 24 in the double-blind treatment phase. A key secondary endpoint was the continuous abstinence 
(CA) rate for week 13 through week 52.  
This study showed the benefit of an additional 12-week treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily 
for the maintenance of smoking cessation compared to placebo; superiority to placebo for CA was 
maintained through week 52. The key results are summarised in the following table:

There is currently limited clinical experience with the use of CHAMPIX among black people to 
determine clinical efficacy. 
Flexible quit date between weeks 1 and 5 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline has been evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility of 
quitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. In this 24-week study, patients received treatment for 
12 weeks followed by a 12 week non-treatment follow up phase. The 4 week (week 9-12) CQR for 
varenicline and placebo was 53.9% and 19.4%, respectively (difference=34.5, 95% CI: 
27.0% - 42.0%) and the CA week 9-24 was 35.2% (varenicline) vs. 12.7% (placebo) 
(difference=22.5%, 95% CI: 15.8% - 29.1%). Patients who are not willing or able to set the target quit 
date within 1-2 weeks, could be offered to start treatment and then choose their own quit date within 
5 weeks. 
Study in subjects re-treated with CHAMPIX  
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 494 patients who had made a 
previous attempt to quit smoking with CHAMPIX, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed 
after treatment. Subjects who experienced an adverse event of a concern during previous treatment 
were excluded. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo 
(N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for up to 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included 
in this study had taken CHAMPIX for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment 
duration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been 
smoking for at least four weeks.  
Patients treated with CHAMPIX had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 
9 through 12 and from weeks 9 through 52 compared to subjects treated with placebo. The key results 
are summarised in the following table:

Gradual approach to quitting smoking 
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 1,510 subjects who 
were not able or willing to quit smoking within four weeks, but were willing to gradually reduce their 
smoking over a 12 week period before quitting. Subjects were randomised to either CHAMPIX 1 mg 
twice daily (n=760) or placebo (n=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. 
Subjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end 
of the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to 
week eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial 
12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with 
CHAMPIX had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo; the key 
results are summarised in the following table:

The CHAMPIX safety profile in this study was consistent with that of pre-marketing studies. 
Subjects with cardiovascular disease 
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with 
stable, cardiovascular disease (other than, or in addition to, hypertension) that had been diagnosed for 
more than 2 months. Subjects were randomised to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (n=353) or placebo 
(n=350) for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The 4 week CQR for 
varenicline and placebo was 47.3% and 14.3%, respectively and the CA week 9-52 was 19.8% 
(varenicline) vs. 7.4% (placebo). 
Deaths and serious cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, committee. The following 
adjudicated events occurred with a frequency ≥ 1% in either treatment group during treatment (or in 
the 30-day period after treatment): nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.1% vs. 0.3% for CHAMPIX and 
placebo, respectively), and hospitalisation for angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 1.1%). During non-treatment 
follow up to 52 weeks, the adjudicated events included need for coronary revascularisation (2.0% vs. 
0.6%), hospitalisation for angina pectoris (1.7% vs. 1.1%), and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular 
disease (PVD) or admission for a PVD procedure (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Some of the patients requiring 
coronary revascularisation underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and 
hospitalisation for angina. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.3% of patients in the CHAMPIX arm 
and 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm over the course of the 52-week study. 
A meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients 
(4190 CHAMPIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the cardiovascular safety of 
CHAMPIX. The study in patients with stable cardiovascular disease described above was included in 
the meta-analysis.  
The key cardiovascular safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and 
nonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent 
committee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred during treatment in the trials included in the 
meta-analysis (CHAMPIX 7 [0.17%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]). Additionally, a small number of MACE 
occurred up to 30 days after treatment (CHAMPIX 13 [0.31%]; placebo 6 [0.21%]). 
The meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHAMPIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 2.83 
(95% confidence interval from 0.76 to 10.55, p=0.12) for patients during treatment and 1.95 (95% 
confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82, p=0.15) for patients up to 30 days after treatment. These are 
equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.5 MACE events and 6.3 MACE events per 
1,000 patient-years, respectively of exposure. The hazard ratio for MACE was higher in patients with 
cardiovascular risk factors in addition to smoking compared with that in patients without 
cardiovascular risk factors other than smoking. There were similar rates of all-cause mortality 
(CHAMPIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and cardiovascular mortality (CHAMPIX 2 [0.05%]; 
placebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHAMPIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis.

Cardiovascular safety assessment study in subjects with and without a history of psychiatric disorder 
The cardiovascular (CV) safety of CHAMPIX was evaluated in the Study in Subjects with and without 
a History of Psychiatric Disorder (parent study; see section 5.1 - Neuropsychiatric safety) and its non-
treatment extension, the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Study, which enrolled 4595 of the 6293 
subjects who completed the parent study (N=8058) and followed them through week 52. Of all 
subjects treated in the parent study, 1749 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 644 (8.0%) had a high 
CV risk, as defined by Framingham score.  
The primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and 
cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. 
The following table shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios vs placebo for all treatment 
groups during treatment, and cumulative for treatment plus 30 days and through end of study.

The use of CHAMPIX, bupropion, and NRT was not associated with an increased risk of CV AEs in 
smokers treated for up to 12 weeks and followed for up to 1 year compared to placebo, although 
because of the relatively low number of events overall, an association cannot be entirely ruled out.   
Subjects with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
The efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for smoking cessation in subjects with  
mild-moderate COPD was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical 
trial. In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week 
non-treatment follow-up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-confirmed, 4-week 
Continuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was the 
Continuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through Week 52. The safety profile of varenicline was 
comparable to what was reported in other trials in the general population, including pulmonary safety.  
The results for the 4W CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) are shown in the

Study in subjects with a history of major depressive disorder 
The efficacy of varenicline was confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of 525 subjects 
with a history of major depression in the past two years or under current stable treatment. The 
cessation rates in this population were similar to those reported in the general population. Continuous 
abstinence rate between weeks 9-12 was 35.9% in the varenicline treatment group versus 15.6% in the 
placebo group (OR 3.35 (95% CI 2.16-5.21)) and between weeks 9-52 was 20.3% versus 10.4% 
respectively (OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.40-3.98)). The most common adverse events (≥ 10%) in subjects 
taking varenicline were nausea (27.0% vs. 10.4% on placebo), headache (16.8% vs. 11.2%), abnormal 
dreams (11.3% vs. 8.2%), insomnia (10.9% vs. 4.8%) and irritability (10.9% vs. 8.2%). Psychiatric 
scales showed no differences between the varenicline and placebo groups and no overall worsening of 
depression, or other psychiatric symptoms, during the study in either treatment group. 
Study in subjects with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  
Varenicline safety and tolerability was assessed in a double-blind study of 128 smokers with stable 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on antipsychotic medication, randomised 2:1 to varenicline 
(1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-drug follow-up.  
The most common adverse events in subjects taking varenicline were nausea (23.8% vs. 14.0% on 
placebo), headache (10.7% vs. 18.6% on placebo) and vomiting (10.7% vs. 9.3% on placebo). Among 
reported neuropsychiatric adverse events, insomnia was the only event reported in either treatment 
group in ≥ 5% of subjects at a rate higher in the varenicline group than in placebo (9.5% vs. 4.7%).  
Overall, there was no worsening of schizophrenia in either treatment group as measured by psychiatric 
scales and there were no overall changes in extra-pyramidal signs. In the varenicline group compared 
to placebo, a higher proportion of subjects reported suicidal ideation or behaviour prior to enrolment 
(lifetime history) and after the end of active treatment period (on Days 33 to 85 after the last dose of 
treatment). During the active treatment period, the incidence of suicide-related events was similar 
between the varenicline-treated and the placebo-treated subjects (11 vs. 9.3%, respectively). The 
percentage of subjects with suicide-related events in the active treatment phase compared to 
post-treatment phase was unchanged in the varenicline group; in the placebo group, this percentage 
was lower in the post-treatment phase. Although there were no completed suicides, there was one 
suicidal attempt in a varenicline-treated subject whose lifetime history included several similar 
attempts. The limited data available from this single smoking cessation study are not sufficient to 
allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the safety in patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder. 
Neuropsychiatric Safety Study in Subjects with and without a History of Psychiatric Disorder:  
Varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that 
included subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4074) and subjects 
without a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3984). Subjects aged 18-75 years, 
smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomised 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion 
SR 150 mg BID, nicotine replacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a 
treatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.  
The primary safety endpoint was a composite of the following neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events: 
severe events of anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, or hostility, and/or moderate or severe events 
of agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, 
psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour or completed suicide. 
The following table shows the rates of the composite NPS adverse event primary endpoint by 
treatment group and the risk differences (RDs) (95% CI) vs placebo in the non-psychiatric cohort.  
In addition, the table shows the subset of the composite NPS AE endpoint of severe intensity:

The rates of events in the composite endpoint were low across all treatment groups and were similar or 
lower for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. The use of varenicline, bupropion and 
NRT in the non-psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk of NPS 
adverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs were lower than 
or included zero). 
The percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based on the Columbia-Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar between the varenicline and placebo groups during

There were more events reported in patients in the psychiatric cohort in each treatment group 
compared with the non-psychiatric cohort, and the incidence of events in the composite endpoint 
was higher for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. However, the use of varenicline, 
bupropion and NRT in the psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk 
of NPS adverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs 
included zero). 
In the psychiatric cohort, the percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based 
on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar between the varenicline and 
placebo groups during treatment and in the non- treatment follow-up, as shown in the following

There were no completed suicides reported in the psychiatric cohort. 
The most commonly reported adverse events in subjects treated with varenicline in this study were 
similar to those observed in premarketing studies.  
In both cohorts, subjects treated with varenicline demonstrated statistical superiority of CO-confirmed 
abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 and 9 through 24 compared to subjects treated with bupropion, 
nicotine patch and placebo (please see table below).

Neuropsychiatric Safety Meta-analyses and Observational Studies:  
Analyses of clinical trial data did not show evidence of an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric 
events with varenicline compared to placebo. In addition, independent observational studies have not 
supported an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline 
compared to patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion.  
Treatment discontinuation  
The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11.4% for varenicline compared with 
9.7% for placebo. In this group, the discontinuation rates for the most common adverse reactions in 
varenicline treated patients were as follows: nausea (2.7% vs. 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs. 
1.0% for placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs. 1.2% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.2% vs. 0.2% for 
placebo). 
Analyses of Clinical Trials:  
A meta-analysis of 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials, including 1907 patients 
(1130 varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported 
on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial 
(N=127) in patients with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial 
(N=525) in patients with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of 
suicidal ideation and/or behaviour in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated 
with placebo, as shown in the table below. Of the 55 patients who reported suicidal ideation or 
behaviour, 48 (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a history 
of schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder, or of depression. Few patients reported these events in the 
other three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo).

A meta-analysis of 18 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to 
assess the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. These trials included the 5 trials described above that 
used the C-SSRS, and a total of 8521 patients (5072 varenicline, 3449 placebo), some of which had 
psychiatric conditions. The results showed a similar incidence of combined neuropsychiatric adverse 
events, other than sleep disorders, in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated with 
placebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89-1.15). Pooled data from these 18 trials showed a 
similar incidence rate of individual categories of psychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline 
compared to patients treated with placebo. The table below describes the most frequently (≥ 1%) 
reported categories of adverse events related to psychiatric safety other than sleep disorders and 
disturbances.

Four observational studies, each including 10,000 to 30,000 users of varenicline in the adjusted 
analyses, compared the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events, including neuropsychiatric 
hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal self-harm, in patients treated with varenicline versus patients 
prescribed NRT or bupropion. All studies were retrospective cohort studies and included patients with 
and without a psychiatric history. All studies used statistical methods to control for confounding 
factors, including preferential prescribing of varenicline to healthier patients, although there is the 
possibility of residual confounding. 
Two of the studies found no difference in risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalisations between varenicline 
users and nicotine patch users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56–2.34 in 
the first study, and 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.46 in the second study). The power to detect differences in 
these two studies was limited. The third study reported no difference in risk of psychiatric adverse 
events diagnosed during an emergency department visit or inpatient admission between varenicline 
users and bupropion users (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55-1.30). Based on post marketing reports, bupropion 
may be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. 
The fourth study showed no evidence of a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal self- harm (HR of 0.88; 
95% CI: 0.52-1.49) in patients prescribed varenicline compared to patients prescribed NRT. The 
occurrence of detected suicide was rare during the three months after patients initiated any drug 
treatment (two cases in 31,260 varenicline users and six cases in 81,545 NRT users). 
Pregnancy Cohort Study 
A population-based cohort study compared infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero (N=335) with 
infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and infants born to non-smoking 
mothers (N=806,438). In this study, infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero as compared to infants 
born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had lower rates of congenital malformations 
(3.6% vs 4.3%), stillbirth (0.3% vs 0.5%), preterm birth (7.5% vs 7.9%), small for gestational age 
(12.5% vs 17.1%), and premature rupture of membrane (3.6% vs 5.4%).  
Paediatric Population 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least 
5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the 
Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age 
and 17-19 years of age) and by body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, 
patients randomised to varenicline with a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose 
group) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received 
0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received 
treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate 
counseling throughout the study.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Maximum plasma concentrations of varenicline occur typically within 3-4 hours after oral 
administration. Following administration of multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers, steady-state 
conditions were reached within 4 days. Absorption is virtually complete after oral administration and 
systemic availability is high. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day 
dosing. 
Distribution 
Varenicline distributes into tissues, including the brain. Apparent volume of distribution averaged 
415 litres (%CV= 50) at steady-state. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (< 20%) and 
independent of both age and renal function. In rodents, varenicline is transferred through the placenta 
and excreted in milk.  
Biotransformation 
Varenicline undergoes minimal metabolism with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine and less than 
10% excreted as metabolites. Minor metabolites in urine include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide 
and hydroxyvarenicline. In circulation, varenicline comprises 91% of drug-related material. Minor 
circulating metabolites include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide and N-glucosylvarenicline. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(IC50 > 6,400 ng/ml). The P450 enzymes tested for inhibition were: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline was shown to not induce the 
activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. Therefore, varenicline is unlikely to alter the 
pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Renal elimination of varenicline is 
primarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion via the organic cationic 
transporter, OCT2 (see section 4.5). 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity/Non linearity 
Varenicline exhibits linear kinetics when given as single (0.1 to 3 mg) or repeated 1 to 3 mg/day 
doses. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
There are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, 
gender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medicinal products, as demonstrated in specific 
pharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Hepatic impairment 
Due to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be 
unaffected in patients with hepatic impairment. (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
Varenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated 
creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min and ≤ 80 ml/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment 
(estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 50 ml/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold 
compared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). In 
subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), varenicline 
exposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), varenicline was 
efficiently removed by haemodialysis (see section 4.2).  
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of varenicline in elderly patients with normal renal function (aged 65-75 years) 
is similar to that of younger adult subjects (see section 4.2). For elderly patients with reduced renal 
function please refer to section 4.2. 
Paediatric population 
Single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in paediatric patients 
aged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg 
daily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight > 55 kg, 
as assessed by AUC (0-24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. 
When 0.5 mg twice daily was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher 
(by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight ≤ 55 kg compared to that noted in the 
adult population. CHAMPIX is not recommended in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this 
population was not demonstrated (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In male 
rats dosed for 2 years with varenicline, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of hibernoma 
(tumour of the brown fat). In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with varenicline there were 
decreases in fertility and increases in the auditory startle response (see section 4.6). These effects were 
observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure 
indicating little relevance to clinical use. Nonclinical data indicate varenicline has reinforcing 
properties albeit with lower potency than nicotine. In clinical studies in humans, varenicline showed 
low abuse potential.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CHAMPIX is indicated for smoking cessation in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: 
Days 1 – 3: 
Days 4 – 7: 
Day 8 – End of treatment:  1 mg twice daily 
0.5 mg once daily 
0.5 mg twice daily 
The patient should set a date to stop smoking. CHAMPIX dosing should usually start at 1-2 weeks 
before this date (see section 5.1). Patients should be treated with CHAMPIX for 12 weeks. 
For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 
12 weeks treatment with CHAMPIX at 1 mg twice daily may be considered for the maintenance of 
abstinence (see section 5.1).  
A gradual approach to quitting smoking with CHAMPIX should be considered for patients who are 
not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of 
treatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. Patients should then continue taking CHAMPIX 
for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks of treatment (see section 5.1). 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior 
CHAMPIX therapy, or who relapsed after treatment, may benefit from another quit attempt with 
CHAMPIX (see section 5.1). 
Patients who cannot tolerate adverse reactions of CHAMPIX may have the dose lowered temporarily 
or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily. 
In smoking cessation therapy, risk for relapse to smoking is elevated in the period immediately 
following the end of treatment. In patients with a high risk of relapse, dose tapering may be considered 
(see section 4.4).  
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2). Because elderly patients are 
more likely to have decreased renal function, prescribers should consider the renal status of an elderly 
patient. 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min 
and ≤ 80 ml/min) to moderate (estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 50 ml/min) renal 
impairment. 
For patients with moderate renal impairment who experience adverse reactions that are not tolerable, 
dosing may be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  
For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the 
recommended dose of CHAMPIX is 1 mg once daily. Dosing should begin at 0.5 mg once daily for 
the first 3 days then increased to 1 mg once daily. Based on insufficient clinical experience with 
CHAMPIX in patients with end stage renal disease, treatment is not recommended in this patient 
population (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
CHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this population 
was not demonstrated (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Method of administration 
CHAMPIX is for oral use and the tablets should be swallowed whole with water. 
CHAMPIX can be taken with or without food 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Effect of smoking cessation 
Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with CHAMPIX, 
may alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of some medicinal products, for which dosage 
adjustment may be necessary (examples include theophylline, warfarin and insulin). As smoking 
induces CYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of plasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
Changes in behaviour or thinking, anxiety, psychosis, mood swings, aggressive behaviour, depression, 
suicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts have been reported in patients attempting to quit 
smoking with CHAMPIX in the post-marketing experience.  
A large randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare 
the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients with and without a history of psychiatric 
disorder treated for smoking cessation with varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy 
patch (NRT) or placebo. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of neuropsychiatric adverse 
events that have been reported in post-marketing experience.  
The use of varenicline in patients with or without a history of psychiatric disorder was not associated 
with an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse events in the composite primary endpoint 
compared with placebo (see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties - Study in Subjects with and 
without a History of Psychiatric Disorder).  
Depressed mood, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, may be a symptom of 
nicotine withdrawal. 
Clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms in 
patients attempting to quit smoking with or without treatment. If serious neuropsychiatric symptoms 
occur whilst on varenicline treatment, patients should discontinue varenicline immediately and 
contact a healthcare professional for re-evaluation of treatment.  
History of psychiatric disorders  
Smoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has been associated with exacerbation of 
underlying psychiatric illness (e.g. depression). 
CHAMPIX smoking cessation studies have provided data in patients with a history of psychiatric 
disorders (see section 5.1).  
In a smoking cessation clinical trial, neuropsychiatric adverse events were reported more frequently in 
patients with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to those without a history of psychiatric 
disorders, regardless of treatment (see section 5.1). 
Care should be taken with patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients should be advised 
accordingly. 
Seizures  
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience there have been reports of seizures in patients with or 
without a history of seizures, treated with CHAMPIX. CHAMPIX should be used cautiously in 
patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. 
Treatment discontinuation  
At the end of treatment, discontinuation of CHAMPIX was associated with an increase in irritability, 
urge to smoke, depression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The prescriber should inform the 
patient accordingly and discuss or consider the need for dose tapering. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular events  
Patients taking CHAMPIX should be instructed to notify their doctor of new or worsening 
cardiovascular symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and 
symptoms of myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 5.1). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients 
treated with varenicline. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), 
neck (throat and larynx) and extremities. There were rare reports of life-threatening angioedema 
requiring urgent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Patients experiencing these 
symptoms should discontinue treatment with varenicline and contact a health care provider 
immediately. 
Cutaneous reactions 
There have also been post-marketing reports of rare but severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme in patients using varenicline. As these skin reactions can 
be life threatening, patients should discontinue treatment at the first sign of rash or skin reaction and 
contact a healthcare provider immediately. 
Excipient information 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on varenicline characteristics and clinical experience to date, CHAMPIX has no clinically 
meaningful drug interactions. No dosage adjustment of CHAMPIX or co-administered medicinal 
products listed below is recommended. 
In vitro studies indicate that varenicline is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds that 
are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
Furthermore since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, active 
substances known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
varenicline (see section 5.2) and therefore a dose adjustment of CHAMPIX would not be required. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at 
therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, active substances that are cleared by renal secretion (e.g., 
metformin - see below) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline.  
Metformin 
Varenicline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Metformin had no effect on varenicline 
pharmacokinetics. 
Cimetidine 
Co-administration of cimetidine, with varenicline increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by 
29% due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. No dosage adjustment is recommended based 
on concomitant cimetidine administration in subjects with normal renal function or in patients with 
mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment, the concomitant use of 
cimetidine and varenicline should be avoided. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Digoxin 
Varenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. 
Warfarin 
Varenicline did not alter the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected 
by varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics (see 
section 4.4). 
Alcohol 
There are limited clinical data on any potential interaction between alcohol and varenicline. There 
have been post marketing reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients treated with 
varenicline. A causal relationship between these events and varenicline use has not been established. 
Use with other therapies for smoking cessation  
Bupropion  
Varenicline did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion. 
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)  
When varenicline and transdermal NRT were co-administered to smokers for 12 days, there was a 
statistically significant decrease in average systolic blood pressure (mean 2.6 mmHg) measured on the 
final day of the study. In this study, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, 
and fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. 
Safety and efficacy of CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not 
been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women indicated no malformative or foetal/neonatal toxicity 
of varenicline (see section 5.1). 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of varenicline during pregnancy (see section 5.1). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether varenicline is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies suggest that 
varenicline is excreted in breast milk. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or 
to continue/discontinue therapy with CHAMPIX should be made taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of CHAMPIX therapy to the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of varenicline on fertility. 
Non-clinical data revealed no hazard for humans based on standard male and female fertility studies in 
the rat (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CHAMPIX may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
CHAMPIX may cause dizziness, somnolence and transient loss of consciousness, and therefore may 
influence the ability to drive and use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex 
machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal 
product affects their ability to perform these activities. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Smoking cessation with or without treatment is associated with various symptoms. For example, 
dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia, irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty 
concentrating; restlessness; decreased heart rate; increased appetite or weight gain have been reported 
in patients attempting to stop smoking. No attempt has been made in either the design or the analysis 
of the CHAMPIX studies to distinguish between adverse reactions associated with study drug 
treatment or those possibly associated with nicotine withdrawal. Adverse drug reactions are based on 
evaluation of data from pre-marketing phase 2-3 studies and updated based on pooled data from 
18 placebo-controlled pre- and post-marketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated 
with varenicline. 
In patients treated with the recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following an initial titration period 
the adverse event most commonly reported was nausea (28.6%). In the majority of cases nausea 
occurred early in the treatment period, was mild to moderate in severity and seldom resulted in 
discontinuation. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
In the table below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo are listed 
by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000)). Within each frequency grouping, 
undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
. 
4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose were reported in pre-marketing clinical trials. 
In case of overdose, standard supportive measures should be instituted as required. 
Varenicline has been shown to be dialyzed in patients with end stage renal disease (see section 5.2), 
however, there is no experience in dialysis following overdose. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs; Drugs used in addictive disorders; Drugs 
used in nicotine dependence, ATC code: N07BA03 
Mechanism of action 
Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors, where it acts as a partial agonist - a compound that has both agonist activity, with lower 
intrinsic efficacy than nicotine, and antagonist activities in the presence of nicotine. 
Electrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline 
binds to the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, 
but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Nicotine competes for the same human α4β2 nAChR 
binding site for which varenicline has higher affinity. Therefore, varenicline can effectively block 
nicotine's ability to fully activate α4β2 receptors and the mesolimbic dopamine system, the neuronal 
mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly 
selective and binds more potently to the α4β2 receptor subtype (Ki=0.15 nM) than to other common 
nicotinic receptors (α3β4 Ki=84 nM, α7 Ki= 620 nM, α1βγδ Ki= 3,400 nM), or to non-nicotinic 
receptors and transporters (Ki > 1µM, except to 5-HT3 receptors: Ki=350 nM). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation is a result of varenicline's partial agonist activity at 
the α4β2 nicotinic receptor where its binding produces an effect sufficient to alleviate symptoms of 
craving and withdrawal (agonist activity), while simultaneously resulting in a reduction of the 
rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking by preventing nicotine binding to α4β2 receptors 
(antagonist activity). 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Smoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop 
smoking and who are provided with additional advice and support. 
The efficacy of CHAMPIX in smoking cessation was demonstrated in 3 clinical trials involving 
chronic cigarette smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes per day). Two thousand six hundred nineteen (2619) 
patients received CHAMPIX 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week), 669 patients received 
bupropion 150 mg BID (also titrated) and 684 patients received placebo. 
Comparative clinical studies 
Two identical double-blind clinical trials prospectively compared the efficacy of CHAMPIX (1 mg 
twice daily), sustained release bupropion (150 mg twice daily) and placebo in smoking cessation. In 
these 52-week duration studies, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week  
non-treatment phase. 
The primary endpoint of the two studies was the carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed, 4-week 
continuous quit rate (4W-CQR) from week 9 through week 12. The primary endpoint for CHAMPIX 
demonstrated statistical superiority to bupropion and placebo. 
After the 40 week non-treatment phase, a key secondary endpoint for both studies was the Continuous 
Abstinence Rate (CA) at week 52. CA was defined as the proportion of all subjects treated who did 
not smoke (not even a puff of a cigarette) from Week 9 through Week 52 and did not have an exhaled 
CO measurement of > 10 ppm. The 4W-CQR (weeks 9 through 12) and CA rate (weeks 9 through 52) 
from studies 1 and 2 are included in the following table:

Patient reported craving, withdrawal and reinforcing effects of smoking 
Across both Studies 1 and 2 during active treatment, craving and withdrawal were significantly 
reduced in patients randomised to CHAMPIX in comparison with placebo. CHAMPIX also 
significantly reduced reinforcing effects of smoking that can perpetuate smoking behaviour in patients 
who smoke during treatment compared with placebo. The effect of varenicline on craving, withdrawal 
and reinforcing effects of smoking were not measured during the non-treatment long-term follow-up 
phase. 
Maintenance of abstinence study 
The third study assessed the benefit of an additional 12 weeks of CHAMPIX therapy on the 
maintenance of abstinence. Patients in this study (n=1,927) received open-label CHAMPIX 1 mg 
twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who stopped smoking by Week 12 were then randomised to receive 
either CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks for a total study duration 
of 52 weeks. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary study endpoint was the CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from week 13 through 
week 24 in the double-blind treatment phase. A key secondary endpoint was the continuous abstinence 
(CA) rate for week 13 through week 52.  
This study showed the benefit of an additional 12-week treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily 
for the maintenance of smoking cessation compared to placebo; superiority to placebo for CA was 
maintained through week 52. The key results are summarised in the following table:

determine clinical efficacy. 
Flexible quit date between weeks 1 and 5 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline has been evaluated in smokers who had the flexibility of 
quitting between weeks 1 and 5 of treatment. In this 24-week study, patients received treatment for 
12 weeks followed by a 12 week non-treatment follow up phase. The 4 week (week 9-12) CQR for 
varenicline and placebo was 53.9% and 19.4%, respectively (difference=34.5%, 95% CI: 27.0% - 
42.0%) and the CA week 9-24 was 35.2% (varenicline) vs. 12.7% (placebo) (difference=22.5%, 95% 
CI: 15.8% - 29.1%). Patients who are not willing or able to set the target quit date within 1-2 weeks, 
could be offered to start treatment and then choose their own quit date within 5 weeks. 
Study in subjects re-treated with CHAMPIX  
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 494 patients who had made a 
previous attempt to quit smoking with CHAMPIX, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed 
after treatment. Subjects who experienced an adverse event of a concern during previous treatment 
were excluded. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo 
(N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for up to 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included 
in this study had taken CHAMPIX for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment 
duration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been 
smoking for at least four weeks.  
Patients treated with CHAMPIX had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 
through 12 and from weeks 9 through 52 compared to subjects treated with placebo. The key results 
are summarised in the following table:

Gradual approach to quitting smoking 
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 1,510 subjects who 
were not able or willing to quit smoking within four weeks, but were willing to gradually reduce their 
smoking over a 12 week period before quitting. Subjects were randomised to either CHAMPIX 1 mg 
twice daily (n=760) or placebo (n=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. 
Subjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end 
of the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to 
week eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial 
12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with 
CHAMPIX had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo; the key 
results are summarised in the following table:

The CHAMPIX safety profile in this study was consistent with that of pre-marketing studies. 
Subjects with cardiovascular disease 
CHAMPIX was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with 
stable, cardiovascular disease (other than, or in addition to, hypertension) that had been diagnosed for 
more than 2 months. Subjects were randomised to CHAMPIX 1 mg twice daily (n=353) or placebo 
(n=350) for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The 4 week CQR for 
varenicline and placebo was 47.3% and 14.3%, respectively and the CA week 9-52 was 19.8% 
(varenicline) vs. 7.4% (placebo). 
Deaths and serious cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, committee. The following 
adjudicated events occurred with a frequency ≥ 1% in either treatment group during treatment (or in 
the 30-day period after treatment): nonfatal myocardial infarction (1.1% vs. 0.3% for CHAMPIX and 
placebo, respectively), and hospitalisation for angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 1.1%). During non-treatment 
follow up to 52 weeks, the adjudicated events included need for coronary revascularisation (2.0% vs. 
0.6%), hospitalisation for angina pectoris (1.7% vs. 1.1%), and new diagnosis of peripheral vascular 
disease (PVD) or admission for a PVD procedure (1.4% vs. 0.6%). Some of the patients requiring 
coronary revascularisation underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and 
hospitalisation for angina. Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.3% of patients in the CHAMPIX arm 
and 0.6% of patients in the placebo arm over the course of the 52-week study. 
A meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients 
(4190 CHAMPIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the cardiovascular safety of 
CHAMPIX. The study in patients with stable cardiovascular disease described above was included in 
the meta-analysis.  
The key cardiovascular safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and 
nonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent 
committee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred during treatment in the trials included in the 
meta-analysis (CHAMPIX 7 [0.17%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]). Additionally, a small number of MACE 
occurred up to 30 days after treatment (CHAMPIX 13 [0.31%]; placebo 6 [0.21%]). 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHAMPIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 2.83 
(95% confidence interval from 0.76 to 10.55, p=0.12) for patients during treatment and 1.95 (95% 
confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82, p=0.15) for patients up to 30 days after treatment. These are 
equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.5 MACE events and 6.3 MACE events per 1,000 
patient-years, respectively of exposure. The hazard ratio for MACE was higher in patients with 
cardiovascular risk factors in addition to smoking compared with that in patients without 
cardiovascular risk factors other than smoking. There were similar rates of all-cause mortality 
(CHAMPIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and cardiovascular mortality (CHAMPIX 2 [0.05%]; 
placebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHAMPIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis. 
Cardiovascular safety assessment study in subjects with and without a history of psychiatric disorder 
The cardiovascular (CV) safety of CHAMPIX was evaluated in the Study in Subjects with and without 
a History of Psychiatric Disorder (parent study; see section 5.1 - Neuropsychiatric safety) and its non-
treatment extension, the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Study, which enrolled 4595 of the 6293 
subjects who completed the parent study (N=8058) and followed them through week 52.  Of all 
subjects treated in the parent study, 1749 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 644 (8.0%) had a high 
CV risk, as defined by Framingham score.  
The primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and 
cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. 
The following table shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios vs placebo for all treatment 
groups during treatment, and cumulative for treatment plus 30 days and through end of study.

The use of CHAMPIX, bupropion, and NRT was not associated with an increased risk of CV AEs in 
smokers treated for up to 12 weeks and followed for up to 1 year compared to placebo, although 
because of the relatively low number of events overall, an association cannot be entirely ruled out.   
Subjects with mild-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
The efficacy and safety of CHAMPIX (1 mg twice daily) for smoking cessation in subjects with  
mild-moderate COPD was demonstrated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical 
trial. In this 52-week duration study, patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a 40-week 
non-treatment follow-up phase. The primary endpoint of the study was the CO-confirmed, 4-week 
Continuous Quit Rate (4W CQR) from week 9 through week 12 and a key secondary endpoint was the 
Continuous Abstinence (CA) from Week 9 through Week 52. The safety profile of varenicline was 
comparable to what was reported in other trials in the general population, including pulmonary safety.

Study in subjects with a history of major depressive disorder 
The efficacy of varenicline was confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled trial in 525 subjects 
with a history of major depression in the past two years or under current stable treatment. The 
cessation rates in this population were similar to those reported in the general population. Continuous 
abstinence rate between weeks 9-12 was 35.9% in the varenicline treatment group versus 15.6% in the 
placebo group (OR 3.35 (95% CI 2.16-5.21)) and between weeks 9-52 was 20.3% versus 10.4% 
respectively (OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.40-3.98)). The most common adverse events (≥ 10%) in subjects 
taking varenicline were nausea (27.0% vs. 10.4% on placebo), headache (16.8% vs. 11.2%), abnormal 
dreams (11.3% vs. 8.2%), insomnia (10.9% vs. 4.8%) and irritability (10.9% vs. 8.2%). Psychiatric 
scales showed no differences between the varenicline and placebo groups and no overall worsening of 
depression, or other psychiatric symptoms, during the study in either treatment group. 
Study in subjects with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder  
Varenicline safety and tolerability was assessed in a double-blind study of 128 smokers with stable 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on antipsychotic medication, randomised 2:1 to varenicline 
(1 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-drug follow-up. 
The most common adverse events in subjects taking varenicline were nausea (23.8% vs. 14.0% on 
placebo), headache (10.7% vs. 18.6% on placebo) and vomiting (10.7% vs. 9.3% on placebo). Among 
reported neuropsychiatric adverse events, insomnia was the only event reported in either treatment 
group in ≥ 5% of subjects at a rate higher in the varenicline group than in placebo (9.5% vs. 4.7%).  
Overall, there was no worsening of schizophrenia in either treatment group as measured by psychiatric 
scales and there were no overall changes in extra-pyramidal signs. In the varenicline group compared 
to placebo, a higher proportion of subjects reported suicidal ideation or behaviour prior to enrolment 
(lifetime history) and after the end of active treatment period (on Days 33 to 85 after the last dose of 
treatment). During the active treatment period, the incidence of suicide-related events was similar 
between the varenicline-treated and the placebo-treated subjects (11 vs. 9.3%, respectively). The 
percentage of subjects with suicide-related events in the active treatment phase compared to 
post-treatment phase was unchanged in the varenicline group; in the placebo group, this percentage 
was lower in the post-treatment phase. Although there were no completed suicides, there was one 
suicidal attempt in a varenicline-treated subject whose lifetime history included several similar 
attempts. The limited data available from this single smoking cessation study are not sufficient to 
allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the safety in patients with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffective disorder. 
Neuropsychiatric Safety Study in Subjects with and without a History of Psychiatric Disorder:  
Varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that 
included subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4074) and subjects 
without a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3984). Subjects aged 18-75 years, 
smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomised 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion 
SR 150 mg BID, nicotine replacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a 
treatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.  
The primary safety endpoint was a composite of the following neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events: 
severe events of anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, or hostility, and/or moderate or severe events 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, 
psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour or completed suicide. 
The following table shows the rates of the composite NPS adverse event primary endpoint by 
treatment group and the risk differences (RDs) (95% CI) vs placebo in the non-psychiatric cohort.

The rates of events in the composite endpoint were low across all treatment groups and were similar or 
lower for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. The use of varenicline, bupropion and 
NRT in the non-psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk of NPS 
adverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs were lower than 
or included zero). 
The percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based on the Columbia-Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was similar between the varenicline and placebo groups during 
treatment and in the non- treatment follow-up, as shown in the following table:

There were more events reported in patients in the psychiatric cohort in each treatment group 
compared with the non-psychiatric cohort, and the incidence of events in the composite endpoint 
was higher for each of the active treatments compared to placebo. However, the use of varenicline, 
bupropion and NRT in the psychiatric cohort was not associated with a significantly increased risk 
of NPS adverse events in the composite primary endpoint compared with placebo (95% CIs 
included zero). 
In the psychiatric cohort, the percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or behaviour based

There were no completed suicides reported in the psychiatric cohort. 
The most commonly reported adverse events in subjects treated with varenicline in this study were 
similar to those observed in premarketing studies. 
In both cohorts, subjects treated with varenicline demonstrated statistical superiority of CO-confirmed 
abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 and 9 through 24 compared to subjects treated with bupropion, 
nicotine patch and placebo (please see table below).

Neuropsychiatric Safety Meta-analyses and Observational Studies:  
Analyses of clinical trial data did not show evidence of an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric 
events with varenicline compared to placebo. In addition, independent observational studies have not 
supported an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline 
compared to patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion.  
Treatment discontinuation  
The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11.4% for varenicline compared with 
9.7% for placebo. In this group, the discontinuation rates for the most common adverse reactions in 
varenicline treated patients were as follows: nausea (2.7% vs. 0.6% for placebo), headache (0.6% vs. 
1.0% for placebo), insomnia (1.3% vs. 1.2% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.2% vs. 0.2% for 
placebo). 
Analyses of Clinical Trials:  
A meta-analysis of 5 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials, including 1907 patients 
(1130 varenicline, 777 placebo), was conducted to assess suicidal ideation and behaviour as reported 
on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This meta-analysis included one trial 
(N=127) in patients with a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and another trial 
(N=525) in patients with a history of depression. The results showed no increase in the incidence of 
suicidal ideation and/or behaviour in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated 
with placebo, as shown in the table below. Of the 55 patients who reported suicidal ideation or 
behaviour, 48 (24 varenicline, 24 placebo) were from the two trials that enrolled patients with a history 
of schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder, or of depression. Few patients reported these events in the 
other three trials (4 varenicline, 3 placebo).

A meta-analysis of 18 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials was conducted to 
assess the neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline. These trials included the 5 trials described above that 
used the C-SSRS, and a total of 8521 patients (5072 varenicline, 3449 placebo), some of which had 
psychiatric conditions. The results showed a similar incidence of combined neuropsychiatric adverse 
events, other than sleep disorders, in patients treated with varenicline compared to patients treated with 
placebo, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89-1.15). Pooled data from these 18 trials showed a 
similar incidence rate of individual categories of psychiatric events in patients treated with varenicline 
compared to patients treated with placebo. The table below describes the most frequently (≥ 1%)

Four observational studies, each including 10,000 to 30,000 users of varenicline in the adjusted 
analyses, compared the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events, including neuropsychiatric 
hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal self-harm, in patients treated with varenicline versus patients 
prescribed NRT or bupropion. All studies were retrospective cohort studies and included patients with 
and without a psychiatric history. All studies used statistical methods to control for confounding 
factors, including preferential prescribing of varenicline to healthier patients, although there is the 
possibility of residual confounding. 
Two of the studies found no difference in risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalisations between varenicline 
users and nicotine patch users (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.56–2.34 in 
the first study, and 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40-1.46 in the second study). The power to detect differences in 
these two studies was limited. The third study reported no difference in risk of psychiatric adverse 
events diagnosed during an emergency department visit or inpatient admission between varenicline 
users and bupropion users (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55-1.30). Based on post marketing reports, bupropion 
may be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. 
The fourth study showed no evidence of a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal self- harm (HR of 0.88; 
95% CI: 0.52-1.49) in patients prescribed varenicline compared to patients prescribed NRT. The 
occurrence of detected suicide was rare during the three months after patients initiated any drug 
treatment (two cases in 31,260 varenicline users and six cases in 81,545 NRT users). 
Pregnancy Cohort Study 
A population-based cohort study compared infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero (N=335) with 
infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and infants born to non-smoking 
mothers (N=806,438). In this study, infants exposed to CHAMPIX in utero as compared to infants 
born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had lower rates of congenital malformations 
(3.6% vs 4.3%), stillbirth (0.3% vs 0.5%), preterm birth (7.5% vs 7.9%), small for gestational age 
(12.5% vs 17.1%), and premature rupture of membrane (3.6% vs 5.4%).  
Paediatric Population 
The efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least 
5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, and had a score of at least 4 on the 
Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale. Patients were stratified by age (12-16 years of age 
and 17-19 years of age) and by body weight (≤55 kg and >55 kg). Following two-week titration, 
patients randomised to varenicline with a body weight >55 kg received 1 mg twice daily (high dose 
group) or 0.5 mg twice daily (low dose group), while patients with a body weight ≤55 kg received 
0.5 mg twice daily (high dose group) or 0.5 mg once daily (low dose group). Patients received

treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate 
counseling throughout the study. 
The following table from the above paediatric study shows a comparison of continuous abstinence 
rates (CAR) from weeks 9-12, confirmed by urine cotinine test, for the full analysis set overall study

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Maximum plasma concentrations of varenicline occur typically within 3-4 hours after oral 
administration. Following administration of multiple oral doses to healthy volunteers, steady-state 
conditions were reached within 4 days. Absorption is virtually complete after oral administration and 
systemic availability is high. Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day 
dosing. 
Distribution 
Varenicline distributes into tissues, including the brain. Apparent volume of distribution averaged 
415 litres (%CV= 50) at steady-state. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (< 20%) and 
independent of both age and renal function. In rodents, varenicline is transferred through the placenta 
and excreted in milk.  
Biotransformation 
Varenicline undergoes minimal metabolism with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine and less than 
10% excreted as metabolites. Minor metabolites in urine include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide 
and hydroxyvarenicline. In circulation, varenicline comprises 91% of drug-related material. Minor 
circulating metabolites include varenicline N-carbamoylglucuronide and N-glucosylvarenicline. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that varenicline does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(IC50 > 6,400 ng/ml). The P450 enzymes tested for inhibition were: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro, varenicline was shown to not induce the 
activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. Therefore, varenicline is unlikely to alter the 
pharmacokinetics of compounds that are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Renal elimination of varenicline is 
primarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion via the organic cationic 
transporter, OCT2 (see section 4.5). 
Linearity/Non linearity 
Varenicline exhibits linear kinetics when given as single (0.1 to 3 mg) or repeated 1 to 3 mg/day 
doses. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
There are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, 
gender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medicinal products, as demonstrated in specific 
pharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Hepatic impairment 
Due to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be 
unaffected in patients with hepatic impairment. (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
Varenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated 
creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min and ≤ 80 ml/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment 
(estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 50 ml/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold 
compared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min). In 
subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), varenicline 
exposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), varenicline was 
efficiently removed by haemodialysis (see section 4.2).  
Elderly  
The pharmacokinetics of varenicline in elderly patients with normal renal function (aged 65-75 years) 
is similar to that of younger adult subjects (see section 4.2). For elderly patients with reduced renal 
function please refer to section 4.2. 
Paediatric population  
Single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in paediatric patients 
aged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg 
daily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight > 55 kg, 
as assessed by AUC (0-24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. 
When 0.5 mg twice daily was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher 
(by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight ≤ 55 kg compared to that noted in the 
adult population. CHAMPIX is not recommended in paediatric patients because its efficacy in this 
population was not demonstrated (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, fertility and embryo-foetal development. In male 
rats dosed for 2 years with varenicline, there was a dose-related increase in the incidence of hibernoma 
(tumour of the brown fat). In the offspring of pregnant rats treated with varenicline there were 
decreases in fertility and increases in the auditory startle response (see section 4.6). These effects were 
observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure 
indicating little relevance to clinical use. Nonclinical data indicate varenicline has reinforcing 
properties albeit with lower potency than nicotine. In clinical studies in humans, varenicline showed 
low abuse potential.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CHAMPIX is and what it is used for

to help them stop smoking. 
CHAMPIX can help to relieve the craving and withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping 
smoking.  
CHAMPIX can also reduce the enjoyment of cigarettes if you do smoke when on treatment. 
2.  What you need to know before you take CHAMPIX 
Do not take CHAMPIX 
- 
If you are allergic to varenicline or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking CHAMPIX. 
There have been reports of depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour and suicide attempts in patients 
taking CHAMPIX. If you are taking CHAMPIX and develop agitation, depressed mood, changes in 
behaviour that are of concern to you or your family or if you develop suicidal thoughts or behaviours 
you should stop taking CHAMPIX and contact your doctor immediately for treatment assessment.

The effects of stopping smoking 
The effects of changes in your body resulting from stopping smoking, with or without treatment with 
CHAMPIX, may alter the way other medicines work. Therefore, in some cases an adjustment of the 
dose may be necessary. See below under ‘Other medicines and CHAMPIX’ for further details. 
For some people, stopping smoking with or without treatment has been associated with an increased 
risk of experiencing changes in thinking or behaviour, feelings of depression and anxiety and can be 
associated with a worsening of psychiatric disorder. If you have a history of psychiatric disorder you 
should discuss this with your doctor.  
Heart symptoms 
New or worse heart or blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems have been reported primarily in people 
who already have cardiovascular problems. Tell your doctor if you have any changes in symptoms 
during treatment with CHAMPIX. Get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of a 
heart attack or stroke.  
Seizures 
Tell your doctor if you have experienced seizures or have epilepsy before your start CHAMPIX 
treatment. Some people have reported seizures while taking CHAMPIX.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Stop taking CHAMPIX and tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following signs 
and symptoms that may indicate a serious allergic reaction: swelling of the face, lips, tongue, gums, 
throat or body and/or difficulty breathing, wheezing.  
Skin reactions 
Potentially life-threatening skin rashes (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Erythema Multiforme) have 
been reported with the use of CHAMPIX. If you develop a rash or if your skin starts to peel or blister 
you should stop taking CHAMPIX and seek emergency medical help. 
Children and adolescents 
CHAMPIX is not recommended for use in paediatric patients as efficacy was not demonstrated. 
Other medicines and CHAMPIX 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In some cases as a result of stopping smoking, with or without CHAMPIX, an adjustment of the dose 
of other medicines may be necessary. Examples include theophylline (a medicine to treat breathing 
problems), warfarin (a medicine to reduce blood clotting), and insulin (a medicine to treat diabetes). If 
in doubt, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you have severe kidney disease you should avoid taking cimetidine (a medicine used for gastric 
problems) at the same time as CHAMPIX as this may cause increased blood levels of CHAMPIX.  
Use of CHAMPIX with other therapies for smoking cessation 
Consult your doctor before using CHAMPIX in combination with other smoking cessation therapies. 
CHAMPIX with food and drink 
There have been some reports of increased intoxicating effects of alcohol in patients taking 
CHAMPIX. However, it is not known if CHAMPIX actually increases alcohol intoxication.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
It is preferable to avoid the use of CHAMPIX while you are pregnant. Talk to your doctor if you are 
intending to become pregnant. 
119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although it was not studied, CHAMPIX may pass into breast milk. You should ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking CHAMPIX. 
Driving and using machines 
CHAMPIX may be linked with dizziness, sleepiness and transient loss of consciousness. You should 
not drive, operate complex machinery or engage in any other potentially hazardous activities until you 
know whether this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities. 
CHAMPIX contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take CHAMPIX 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
You are more likely to stop smoking if you are motivated to stop. Your doctor and pharmacist can 
provide advice, support and sources of further information to help ensure your attempt to stop smoking 
is successful. 
Before starting your course of CHAMPIX you should usually decide on a date in the second week of 
treatment (between day 8 and day 14) when you will stop smoking. If you are not willing or able to set 
a target quit date within 2 weeks, you may choose your own target quit date within 5 weeks after 
starting treatment. You should write this date on the pack as a reminder.  
CHAMPIX comes as a white tablet (0.5 mg) and a light blue tablet (1 mg). You start with the white 
tablet and then usually go to the light blue tablet. See the chart below for the usual dosing instructions 
which you should follow from Day 1. 
Week 1 
Day 1 - 3 
Day 4 - 7 
Week 2 
Day 8 – 14  
Weeks 3 - 12 
Day 15 -  
end of 
treatment 
Dose 
From day 1 to day 3, you should take one white CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablet once 
a day. 
From day 4 to day 7, you should take one white CHAMPIX 0.5 mg film-coated tablet twice 
daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. 
From day 8 to day 14, you should take one light blue CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablet 
twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. 
From day 15 until the end of treatment, you should take one light blue CHAMPIX 1 mg 
film-coated tablet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the 
same time each day. 
After 12 weeks of treatment, if you have stopped smoking, your doctor may recommend an additional 
12 weeks of treatment with CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablets twice daily to help avoid returning 
back to smoking. 
If you are not able or willing to quit smoking straight away, you should reduce smoking during the 
first 12 weeks of treatment and quit by the end of that treatment period. You should then continue to 
120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
take CHAMPIX 1 mg film-coated tablets twice daily for a further 12 weeks resulting in a total of 
24 weeks of treatment. 
Should you experience adverse effects that you cannot tolerate your doctor may decide to reduce your 
dose temporarily or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily.  
If you have problems with your kidneys, you should speak to your doctor before taking CHAMPIX. 
You may need a lower dose. 
Champix is for oral use. 
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and can be taken with or without food. 
If you take more CHAMPIX than you should 
If you accidentally take more CHAMPIX than your doctor prescribed, you must seek medical advice 
or go to the nearest hospital casualty department immediately. Take your box of tablets with you. 
If you forget to take CHAMPIX  
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet. It is important that you take CHAMPIX 
regularly at the same time each day. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If, it 
is within 3-4 hours before your next dose, do not take the tablet that you have missed.  
If you stop taking CHAMPIX 
It has been shown in clinical trials that taking all doses of your medicine at the appropriate times and 
for the recommended duration of treatment described above will increase your chances of stopping 
smoking. Therefore, unless your doctor instructs you to stop treatment, it is important to keep taking 
CHAMPIX, according to the instructions described in the table above. 
In smoking cessation therapy, risk of returning to smoking may be elevated in the period immediately 
following the end of treatment. You may temporarily experience increased irritability, urge to smoke, 
depression and/or sleep disturbances when you stop taking CHAMPIX. Your doctor may decide to 
gradually lower your dose of CHAMPIX at the end of treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Giving up smoking with or without treatment can cause various symptoms. These could include 
changes of mood (like feeling depressed, irritable, frustrated or anxious), sleeplessness, difficulty 
concentrating, decreased heart rate and increased appetite or weight gain. 
You should be aware of the possible emergence of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as 
agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behaviour during a quit attempt with or without CHAMPIX 
and you should contact a doctor or pharmacist if you experience such symptoms. 
Serious side effects of either an uncommon or rare frequency have occurred in people attempting to 
quit smoking with CHAMPIX: seizure, stroke, heart attack, suicidal thoughts, loss of contact with 
reality and unable to think or judge clearly (psychosis), changes in thinking or behaviour (such as 
aggression and abnormal behaviour). There have also been reports of severe skin reactions including 
Erythema Multiforme (a type of rash) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (a serious illness with blistering 
of the skin, mouth, around the eyes or genitals) and serious allergic reactions including angioedema 
(swelling of the face, mouth, or throat).

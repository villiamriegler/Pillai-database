The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0294/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0294/2015 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP regarding the PrEP indication. It should be noted that 
the MAH did not sponsor the studies that are reported in this assessment report to support the PrEP 
indication. 
At a pre-submission meeting with the European Medicines Agency on 19 May 2015 it was explained that 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 5/99 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the principal data source in the application to support the use of Truvada for PrEPs setting would be study 
CO-US-104-0288 (Chemoprophylaxis for HIV Prevention in Men; also known as the Pre-exposure 
Prophylaxis Initiative or iPrEx study). A second study (CO-US-104-0380; Parallel Comparison of Tenofovir 
and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis to Prevent HIV-1 Acquisition within HIV-1 
Discordant Couples; Partner’s PrEP) would provide additional data in support of the application. Important 
data from some other clinical studies would be included where relevant, particularly to add to the safety 
information.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that there were 2 million new 
HIV-1 infections in 2014, despite widespread knowledge of the protective benefits of abstinence, 
monogamy and condoms. In the EU/EEA, the ECDC reported that 29,381 diagnosed cases of HIV infection 
were newly reported in 2012, which equates with 5.8 per 100,000 persons. The principal interventions 
currently in use to prevent HIV-1 transmission in the EU are voluntary testing, risk counselling and the 
promotion of condoms. The effectiveness of these interventions has been variable and the prevalence of 
HIV-1 remains high even in settings with 100% condom promotion policies. In the absence of a 
pre-exposure vaccine, an important medical need exists for a novel approach to augment HIV-1 
prevention services and reduce the spread of HIV. 
Clinical studies to evaluate pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) studies followed on from a demonstration 
that antiretroviral therapy (ART) could decrease HIV-1 seroconversion rates in animal models. ART was 
also found to decrease infection rates when applied to maternal-to-child transmission. Studies of the 
pathogenesis of early infection in primate models infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 
suggested that systemic infection did not occur immediately, leaving a brief window of opportunity during 
which ART may modify or prevent viral replication at the site of infection, specifically in the initial target 
dendritic-like cells or lymph nodes.  
As a subpopulation, men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by the global 
HIV-1 epidemic with a rate of HIV-1 infection reported to be 19.3-fold higher than in the general 
population of adults of reproductive age based on a multinational meta-analysis of data from 38 
low-to-middle income countries. Epidemiologic reports from high-income countries (e.g. US, Australia, 
Western EU) also indicate that MSM are disproportionately impacted. Recent trends showing high rates of 
HIV-1 infection among MSM in the US, particularly in younger or minority subpopulations, provide 
evidence of resurgence in the spread of HIV-1. European populations show a similar trend. 
High risk for HIV-1 transmission is also inherent within stable, sexually active, HIV-1 discordant 
partnerships. In many settings, HIV-1 sero-discordant couples (in which one of the partners is infected 
with HIV-1 and the other is uninfected) comprise 50% of couples with at least one infected partner.  HIV-1 
discordant couples face unique challenges, including the desire to seek pregnancy. Thus, for stable, 
heterosexual, HIV-1 discordant partners, there is a critical public health need to identify simplified, 
non-contraceptive-based interventions that can prevent HIV-1 acquisition. 
Clinical studies have evaluated tenofovir, either as a vaginal gel or as oral TDF or oral FTC/TDF for PrEP 
settings relevant to heterosexual HIV-1 transmission. Coitally-associated use of 1% tenofovir vaginal gel 
decreased the risk of HIV-1 acquisition among heterosexual women by 39%. Initial clinical data 
supporting oral TDF for HIV-1 PrEP were obtained from a Phase 2 US study in uninfected MSM and 
transgender women who have sex with men (CDC 4323) and from a Phase 2 study of TDF for HIV-1 PrEP 
in West African women (the FHI PrEP study). Studies with oral Truvada followed as summarised in the 
figure below. These included a study in heterosexually active adults in Botswana (CDC TDF2), which 
provided supportive evidence for the use of Truvada chemoprophylaxis. 
In contrast, a study of oral FTC/TDF in African women at high-risk for HIV-1 infection was terminated 
early because there was an equal number of HIV-1 infections in the FTC/TDF and placebo groups 
(FEM-PrEP). Subsequently, the VOICE study was modified to eliminate the use of the oral TDF arm and 
Assessment report

later terminated completely when planned reviews of study data concluded that the study would not be 
able to demonstrate that any of oral TDF or Truvada or TDF vaginal gel would be effective in preventing 
HIV in the women enrolled in the study. In both terminated studies the investigators concluded that lack 
of efficacy was due to poor adherence, which was supported by the plasma drug concentrations.  
The EACS 2015 guidelines regarding PrEP are as follows:  
PrEP can be used in adults at high-risk of acquiring HIV infection.  
• Recommended in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender individuals who are 
inconsistent in their use of condoms with casual partners or with HIV-positive partners who are not on 
treatment. A recent STD or use of post-exposure prophylaxis may be markers of increased risk for HIV 
acquisition. 
• May be considered in HIV-negative heterosexual women and men who are inconsistent in their use of 
condoms and likely to have HIV positive partners who are not on treatment. 
While overall recommending a daily administration, the EACS guidelines state that for MSM with high-risk 
sexual behaviour, PrEP may be dosed ‘on demand’ (double dose of drug 2-24 hours before each sexual 
intercourse, followed by two single doses of drug, 24 and 48 hours after the first drug intake). If dosed ‘on 
demand’, the total dose per week should not exceed 7 tablets. 
About the product 
The rationale for development of Truvada for PrEP was based on nonclinical and clinical data, much of 
which was not generated by the MAH and some of which relates to TDF alone rather than Truvada. In 
addition, some of the data relate to daily prophylaxis (as proposed in this variation) and some to 
immediate pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. 
Controlled nonclinical studies in macaques showed that oral or subcutaneous treatment with TDF (with or 
without FTC) prevented or delayed the onset of viraemia when administered either before or shortly after 
rectal, vaginal or intravenous inoculation with SIV or HIV. Macaques that became infected while under 
treatment had a longer median time to infection or lower levels of viral DNA than untreated controls. 
Nonclinical studies regarding use of intermittent PrEP demonstrated that a pre-exposure dose combined 
with a post-exposure dose was highly protective. 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 8/99 
 
  
  
 
The current application to add an indication for use of daily Truvada for PrEP is principally based on 
CO-US-104-0288 (iPrEx), which was conducted in MSM. A second study (CO-US-104-0380) in HIV-1 
discordant couples (Partner’s PrEP) provides additional supportive data. These were the two studies that 
were included in the FDA US application that led to approval of Truvada for PrEP. The data from CDC 4323 
(see figure above) are considered supportive. Since approval of Truvada for PrEP in the US, two additional 
studies (Ipergay and PROUD; not shown in the figure above) reported on the use of Truvada for PrEP. The 
MAH does not have access to the databases for these studies. In publications, both studies reported an 
86% reduction in HIV incidence among subjects who received Truvada as compared with those did not 
receive Truvada.  
The Ipergay study (France/Canada) in high-risk MSM investigated Truvada as event-driven PrEP (dosing 
before and after sex). The PROUD study (UK) in MSM investigated daily Truvada. Both studies selected 
subjects who were highly sexually active and the HIV incidence in the control groups was higher than 
expected. Both studies were discontinued early due to overwhelming evidence of efficacy following review 
by separate external independent data review committees. Regardless of the Truvada PrEP dosing 
regimen used, the safety findings reported across both studies were consistent with its known profile as 
described in the SmPC. 
Truvada is proposed to be suitable for PrEP based on QD dosing, a relatively long half-life, the large 
amount of data on safety and efficacy in HIV treatment and the infrequent selection of drug-resistant 
variants that have mutations associated with diminished capacity for replication.  
Non-clinical and clinical data support use of FTC and TDF together for chemoprophylaxis based on 
increased activity and the barrier to drug resistance. The use of Truvada rather than TDF alone for HIV-1 
prophylaxis is proposed to be supported by the comparison made in CO-US-104-0380. 
The proposed new (additional) indication is as follows: 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): 
Truvada is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the 
risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has not conducted any new nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic or toxicology studies to 
support the PrEP indication. No new non-clinical studies are required. An overview of the previously 
submitted pharmacology/virology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology data with emtricitabine and 
tenofovir DF was provided along with more detailed discussion of the nonclinical bibliographic studies 
assessing the use of the combination for the prevention of HIV-1 infection. This was considered sufficient 
in support of this application.  
Given that there are extensive clinical data with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF 
(Truvada) for the desired indication, only the nonclinical data assessing the use of the combination for the 
prevention of HIV-1 infection are discussed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 9/99 
 
  
  
 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
A  number  of  in-vivo  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  use  of  FTC  and/or  TDF  for  pre-  and 
post-exposure prophylaxis (see table below). These nonclinical studies investigated the use of oral FTC 
and TDF for pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection across multiple routes of transmission; including 
studies aimed at demonstrating that the addition of FTC to TDF administration increased protection from 
infection. 
Oral studies (intended route of administration)  
Non-human primates  
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 
A series of studies was conducted in order to evaluate oral administration of low levels of SIV to infant 
rhesus macaques for 5 days to simulate transmission of HIV via breast milk (Van Rompay et al 2006, Van 
Rompay et al 2002). In the first of the relevant studies TDF at 10 mg/kg given to the animals for 7 days, 
starting from 1 day before to 1 day after the 5 days of inoculation. Five of 6 animals had no detectable 
viraemia and were re-inoculated at 4 weeks of age with oral SIV for 5 days and 10 mg/kg of TDF for 7 
days. Three of the 5 animals remained uninfected. 
Another group of macaques was similarly dosed, but treated continuously through the re-inoculation 4 
weeks later for a total treatment period of 7 weeks. Five of 6 animals had no detectable viraemia 4 weeks 
after the first inoculation; 4 became infected after the second inoculation. Subsequent to this study, the 
pharmacokinetics associated with 10 mg/kg TDF over time was evaluated in healthy infant macaques. 
The levels of TFV in plasma were approximately 65% lower at 4 weeks of age than at 1 week of age, 
suggesting that the increased rate of infection at 4 weeks or greater of age may be related to suboptimal 
TFV levels.

Following  these  proof-of-principle  studies,  an  intra-rectal  repeat exposure  model  of  HIV  infection  was 
developed.  Non-traumatic  rectal  inoculation  was  conducted  on  anaesthetised  macaques;  animals 
remained recumbent for at least 15 minutes after inoculation. The intention was that all control animals 
were infected. The model used a challenge inoculum that is intended to more closely mimic the infection 
risk seen in the clinical setting. Multiple inoculations of virus have been used to mimic high-risk human 
exposures and evaluate protection against multiple transmission events in each animal.

One of the first studies to use this model evaluated Chinese rhesus macaques given 0 (control), 22 mg/kg 
TDF once daily or 22 mg/kg TDF orally once weekly for 36 weeks (4 animals per group) (Subbarao et al. 
2006, Van Rompay et al. 2006).  
All animals received weekly rectal inoculations of 3.8 × 105 of SHIV162p3 (10 TCID) either until they 
became  infected  or  for  14  weeks.  Plasma  levels  of  TFV  were  measured  2  hours  after  oral  TDF 
administration.  
There was no difference in plasma TFV levels between treated groups and the mean and median TFV 
levels were 2003 ng/mL (SD ± 3521) and 499 ng/mL, respectively. Infection occurred after a median of 
1.5 inoculations of the control animals. Infection was delayed in treated animals, occurring after 6 or 7 
weeks  in  the  daily  or  weekly  treated  TDF  animals,  respectively.  One  animal  treated  daily  remained 
uninfected for the 36 week study duration. The low rate of complete protection (13%) may be have been 
due to the small group size, variable TFV plasma levels or the use of only one antiviral agent. 
TDF, emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF or FTC/TFV (Tenofovir) 
In another study daily and intermittent oral and SC administration of FTC and TDF in macaques inoculated 
with SHIV weekly for 14 weeks via rectal administration (Garcia-Lerma et al 2008) was examined. Each 
SHIV162p3 inoculation was 7.6 × 105 RNA copies (10× TCID50), within the range of HIV-1 RNA levels 
observed in semen (103-106 copies/mL) during acute infection in humans and higher than the levels 
(102-104 copies/mL) observed after primary viraemia. Animals were treated daily or intermittently. Daily 
treatment  was  initiated  7-9  days  before  the  first  virus  inoculation.  Treated  animals  that  remained 
negative  during  the  14  weekly  challenges  were  administered  drug  for  an  additional  28  days.  Treated 
animals  that  became  infected  continued  treatment  to  monitor  plasma  viraemia  and  drug  resistance 
emergence. 
Prior to the treatment phase, a single dose oral pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 6 macaques 
using FTC doses of between 12 and 48 mg/kg. An oral FTC dose of 20 mg/kg gave an AUC0-24 of 13.2 
μg•h/mL, similar to that observed after a single 200 mg FTC dose in humans (AUC0-24 of 10 μg•h/mL). 
The PBMC intracellular concentrations of FTC triphosphate were also similar to that observed in clinical 
studies. As a result a dose of 20 mg/kg was selected as the FTC dose.  
A single oral pharmacokinetic study was also conducted in 5 macaques using TDF doses between 15 and 
46 mg/kg. Oral TDF doses of 20 and 24 mg/kg resulted in TFV AUC0-24 values of 3.2 and 3.4 μg•h/mL, 
respectively, similar to the TFV range observed in humans (2.1 to 3.2 μg•h/mL). The PBMC intracellular 
concentrations of TFV diphosphate were also similar to human levels. Therefore, a dose of 22 mg/kg was 
selected as the TDF dose.  
The control group of 18 untreated animals became infected after a median of two rectal exposures. It was 
shown that the dual agent regimens were more efficacious than the single agent regimen.

Table 2.  Daily or Intermittent Prophylaxis of Rhesus Macaques with Oral or Subcutaneous TDF, FTC, 
FTC/TDF or FTC/TFV 
Garcia-Lerma et al, 2008 
In the group that received daily FTC and TDF orally, four animals remained uninfected and infection was 
significantly delayed in the other two macaques (viraemia detected between exposures 9 and 12). All 12 
macaques that received SC injections of FTC and TFV either daily or as a pre/post exposure regimen 
remained uninfected after 14 viral exposures. In the group that was given SC FTC only, two macaques did 
not  become infected.  Infection  was  significantly  delayed  in  the  other  four  animals  (viraemia  detected 
between exposures 5 and 13). The six treated animals with breakthrough infections had attenuated acute 
viraemia which may have helped to preserve immune function. Two macaques (one treated with FTC by 
SC; one treated with FTC and TDF, orally) had FTC resistant mutants emerge (M184V, M184I) but no TFV 
resistance developed. 
A follow-up study was conducted that evaluated intermittent drug dosing modalities. It showed that orally 
administered FTC and TDF to rhesus macaque monkeys could prevent SHIV infection or reduce the early 
viraemia (Garcia-Lerma JG, 2010). Animals were inoculated with SHIV weekly for 14 weeks via rectal 
administration. Various dosing regimens using orally administered 20 mg/kg FTC and 22 mg/kg TDF were 
evaluated.

According to the MAH, all regimens provided a measure of protection from infection. In those treated 
animals that became infected, the mean peak viraemia was lower compared to the controls. Virus loads 
declined faster in infected animals during continued treatment. In the one animal that became infected 
after being administered the higher doses of FTC and TDF, plasma drug concentrations of FTC and TFV 
were consistently low. None of the animals that became infected had virus with detectable resistance. The 
limited plasma and rectal secretion pharmacokinetic data collected from satellite groups of animals given 
20  mg/kg  FTC  orally  and  22  mg/kg  TDF  were  too  variable  to  establish  a  clear  association  between 
protection and drug concentrations. 
The efficacy of intermittent prophylaxis (pre- and post-exposure) of oral 20 mg/kg FTC and 22 mg/kg TDF 
was compared to the effectiveness of a single pre-exposure dose of oral 20 mg/kg FTC and 22 mg/kg TDF 
administered  3  days  prior  to  virus  challenge  (Garcia-Lerma  et  al.  2010).  Macaques  (6/group)  were 
inoculated  with  SHIV  weekly  for  14  weeks  via  rectal  administration.  This  study  also  showed  that  oral 
administration of both FTC and TDF pre- and post-exposure significantly reduced the risk of infection. 
Despite the persistence of TFV-DP in PBMCs and high TFV-DP levels in rectal tissues, a single dose of 
FTC/TDF 3 days prior to exposure was not effective in preventing infection. 
An additional study (Cong et al. 2011b) investigated whether FTC/TDF maintained prophylactic efficacy 
against an FTC-resistant virus containing the M184V mutation.  
Similar  to  that  seen  in  HIV-1  harbouring  M184V,  the  SHIV162p3M184V  isolate  showed  high  level  (> 
100-fold)  resistance  to  FTC  and  hyper-susceptibility  (0.3-fold)  to  TFV  compared  to  the  wild  type, 
SHIV162p3WT (Cong et al. 2011a). Due to reduced transmissibility, the dose of SHIV162p3M184V was 
increased 4-fold to 40 TCID 50 which was shown to infect 5/5 macaques after a median of three intra-rectal 
exposures. 
Macaques  were  inoculated  with  the  SHIV162p3M184V  weekly  for  14  weeks  via  rectal  administration. 
Animals were given 20 mg/kg FTC and 22 mg/kg TDF orally. The antivirals were administered 3 days 
before and 2 hours after each inoculation, which can be compared to the efficacy (83% protected) after 
SHIV162p3WT inoculation using the same treatment regimen.

SHIV162p3M184V 
1 20 mg/kg FTC and 22 mg/kg TDF 
2 Inoculations were via the intrarectal route, once weekly for 14 weeks 
FTC/TDF  maintained  prophylactic  efficacy  against  an  FTC-resistant  SHIV162p3M184V  isolate  in 
macaques after 14 weekly inoculations and a 20-week follow-up period. The residual antiviral activity by 
FTC, the hyper susceptibility of the M184V mutants to TFV and/or the reduced viral fitness of the M184V 
mutants may have contributed to the prophylactic efficacy of FTC/TDF. 
A  macaque  model  was  used  to  evaluate  oral  or  topical  pre-exposure  prophylaxis  via  intravaginal 
inoculation (Teague et al. 2015). Macaques were inoculated with the SHIV162p3 virus weekly for up to 18 
weeks via vaginal administration weekly for up to 18 weeks. Orally administered 20 mg/kg FTC and 22 
mg/kg TDF was evaluated for prophylactic efficacy. The antivirals were administered 22 hours before and 
2  hours  after  each  inoculation,  which  can  be  compared  to  the  efficacy  (83%  protected)  after

SHIV162p3WT inoculation using the same treatment regimen. Five of the 6 exposed uninfected macaques 
developed virus-specific T cells that were detected up to 3 weeks after the last virus challenge. 
Supportive data (other routes of administration) 
Juvenile macaques were inoculated IV with a single high dose (103−105 TCID50) of SIV/SHIV and given 20 
or 30 mg/kg TFV subcutaneously (Tsai et al. 1995). Tenofovir was administered daily for 4 weeks starting 
either  48  hours  before,  4  hours  after  or  24  hours  after  intravenous  virus  inoculation.  Animals  were 
monitored for up to 56 weeks. None of the 25 TFV-treated macaques became infected. In contrast, all 10 
of  the  untreated  animals  became  infected  within  3  weeks  post  inoculation.  The  30  mg/kg  SC  dose, 
however, provided very high plasma TFV concentrations in infant and juvenile macaques (AUCs  > 45 
μg•h/mL; 15 fold higher than TFV after oral TDF clinical exposure) which resulted in renal toxicity with 
chronic administration (Van Rompay, 2008). 
Humanised mice (BLT mice) were given 3.5 mg FTC and 5.2 mg TDF daily for 7 days via intraperitoneal 
injection. Viral exposure via vaginal (Denton et al. 2008), rectal (Denton et al. 2010), or intravenous 
(Denton  et  al.  2010)  HIV-1  administration  occurred  3  hours  after  the  third  FTC/TDF  dose.  The 
administration of FTC and TDF in combination prevented rectal (n = 9), vaginal (n = 8) and intravenous 
(n = 5) HIV-1 infection in all treated animals based on the lack of HIV-1 DNA in blood and tissues. In the 
absence of treatment, 88 to 100% of the mice had evidence of infection.  
BLT mice were administered the 1% TFV gel used in a clinical studies once vaginally 4 hours before and 
once 4 hours after vaginal viral (HIV-1JR-CSF) exposure (Denton et al. 2011). Protection from vaginal 
HIV-1  exposure  transmission  occurred  in  7/8  mice  after  7  weeks.  Additionally,  BLT  mice  were 
administered  28  µM  of  FTC  and  16.5  µM  of  TDF  once  vaginally  4  hours  before  vaginal  viral  exposure 
(Denton et al. 2011). The combination of vaginal FTC/TDF protected 8 of 9 BLT mice from vaginal HIV-1 
infection. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
There  are  extensive  clinical  PK  and  toxicokinetic  (TK)  data  with  the  combination  of  emtricitabine  and 
tenofovir DF (Truvada) and there has been vast human exposure. Thus, non-clinical PK and TK data are 
superseded and will not be discussed in this report.   
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
Due to extensive clinical usage non-clinical toxicology data will not be discussed in this report.   
2.2.5.  Eco toxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  MAH  has  not  provided  an  updated  ERA  as  the  potential  use  of  Truvada  in  adult  patients  for 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is not considered to significantly impact the overall predicted volume of 
use to increase by more than 10%. As detailed in the ERAs for other emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir DF 
containing regimens, the highest RQ is for TDF in fish (0.0009), therefore an increase in use for Truvada 
of 1111 times would be needed to pose an unacceptable risk. 
It is acknowledged that an increase of 10%  has  no impact on the outcome of the environmental risk 
assessment; however the MAH is requested to revisit the environmental risk assessment in view of the 
evolution of the global exposure data within the PSURs. As a consequence the MAH should revisit the RMP 
in  case  of  major  increase  of  the  global  exposure  in  the  PSURs  subsequent  to  approval  of  the  PrEP 
indication.

2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided an adequate non-clinical overview that appropriately focused on the non-clinical 
prophylaxis studies. These were mainly carried in out in NHPs. Although results were variable (probably 
due to small animal numbers) on the whole these studies demonstrated efficacy for prophylactic 
admiration. Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC are in line with the product literature for the approved 
product for HIV-1 treatment and are appropriate.  
The CHMP acknowledged that an increase of 10% has no impact on the outcome of the environmental risk 
assessment; however the MAH is requested to revisit the environmental risk assessment in view of the 
evolution of the global exposure data within the PSURs. In addition, the MAH should also revisit the RMP 
in case of major increase of the global exposure in the PSURs subsequent to approval of the PrEP 
indication. 
2.2.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
The CHMP considered that the submitted non-clinical are satisfactory and dta are adequately reflected in 
Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. The MAH is requested to revisit the environmental risk assessment in 
view of the evolution of the global exposure data within the PSURs. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The two major and the supportive clinical trials were not sponsored by the MAH. The clinical expert does 
not provide a statement to the effect that the trials were performed in accordance with GCP. However, the 
two main studies in this application dossier were conducted under an IND and the CSRs contain detailed 
statements regarding compliance with ICH GCP requirements.  
The MAH provided a separate statement of compliance regarding studies conducted outside of the EU. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Food effect study GS-US-236-0105 
Study title: A Phase 1 Study to Determine the Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Elvitegravir, 
Emtricitabine, Tenofovir DF plus Pharmacoenhancer GS-9350 Fixed-Dose Combination Tablet 
GS-US-236-0105  evaluated the effect of food (fasted, light and high-fat meal) on the PK of EVG, COBI, 
FTC and TFV when the F1 formulation of the QUAD STR (EVG 150 mg, COBI 150 mg, FTC 200 mg, TDF 300 
mg) was administered once daily for 15 days. The AUC TFV increased by about 23-25% in the fed state 
regardless of the type of meal. Cmax increased by 20% after a light meal vs. fasted administration but 
such a difference was not observed after a high fat/high calorie meal.

(PK Analysis Set) 
CI: confidence interval, GLSM: geometric least squares mean, HC: high calorie, HF: high fat 
GLSMs were obtained using a mixed-effects model 
Based on these data and on the wide range of plasma concentrations documented in patients who have 
received TDF in various combinations in clinical trials for treatment of HIV-1 the CHMP considers that 
there is no good reason to persist with demanding that Truvada is given with food. A statement that: It is 
preferable that Truvada is taken with food and has been added in section 4.2 of the SmPC and adequately 
reflected in the PL. 
There were no new additional data except for those used to document the level of adherence in clinical 
trials. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
There are no new data since the efficacy of TFV and FTC within regimens for treatment of HIV-1 is well 
established. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Aspects of the relationship between plasma levels and protection against acquisition of HIV-1 are 
described by study in the section on efficacy. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
For these well-established agents no further clinical pharmacology studies are required. There are some 
published data of relevance to the use of Truvada for PrEP. For example, Patterson et al. (2011) studied 
the concentrations of TFV, FTC, and their active metabolites in mucosal tissues, genital secretions, and 
blood plasma after a single oral dose of Truvada in 8 men and 7 women using an ultrasensitive assay and 
reported that TFV and TFV-DP concentrations were 100-fold higher in rectal tissue compared to vaginal 
and cervical tissues. Cottrell et al. (2016) developed a PK/PD model based on mucosal tissue 
concentrations of TFV, FTC and the phosphorylated active metabolites and competing endogenous 
nucleotides (dATP, dCTP) in 47 healthy women. Colorectal TFV-DP was 10 times higher vs. the female 
Assessment report

genital tract while endogenous nucleotides were 7-11 times lower. The model predicted ≥98% of the 
population would achieve protective mucosal tissue exposure by the third daily dose of Truvada. A 
minimum adherence of 6/7 doses/week was required to protect in the female genital tract while 2/7 
doses/week was required for colorectal tissue, indicating that adherence is even more important for 
efficacy in women than men. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Please refer to the clinical efficacy section for the description of the relationship between detecting plasma 
TFV and/or intracellular TFV-DP and protection against HIV-1 acquisition. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
There were no clinical dose response studies to support selection of the dose for PrEP. The dose of 
TDF/FTC approved for treatment of HIV-1 has been used for PrEP. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
MSM study – iPrEx (CO-US-104-0288) 
The sponsor of this study was NIAID. The MAH provided study drug and matching placebo. 
The interim study report (CSR) covers data from the blinded treatment phase up to the data cut used for 
the study primary efficacy endpoint (through 01 May 2010) and for 8 weeks after the final blinded study 
drug dose. A second final CSR provides the data up to 01 November 2010. 
Methods 
This study was designed to evaluate whether daily emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(TDF)  (FTC/TDF;  Truvada)  has  an  acceptable  safety  profile  and  decreases  the  incidence  of  HIV-1  in 
uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) who are receiving standard prevention interventions.  
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a duration that was event driven, i.e. 
it was to continue until at least 85 seroconversion events had occurred. The blinded treatment phase was 
followed  by  an  open-label,  single-arm  FTC/TDF  dosing  phase  that  initiated  in  2011  following  the 
implementation of Protocol Version 5.  
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the blinded treatment phase were: 
• 
• 
To determine if daily oral FTC/TDF was associated with comparable rates of adverse events (AEs) 
compared with placebo among HIV-1-uninfected MSM 
To determine if daily oral FTC/TDF reduced HIV-1 incidence among HIV-1-uninfected MSM 
The secondary objectives of the blinded treatment phase were:

• 
• 
• 
• 
To  determine  if  hepatic  viral  flares  occurred  in  subjects  who  are  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen 
positive (HBsAg+) during and after FTC/TDF chemoprophylaxis 
To determine if significant changes in bone mineral density, body fat distribution or fasting lipids 
occurred during and after FTC/TDF chemoprophylaxis 
To  determine  if  prior  exposure  to  FTC/TDF  chemoprophylaxis  affected  the  course  of  HIV-1 
infection, as predicted by plasma RNA level, CD4 T-cell counts, drug resistance assays and other 
clinical, virological or immunological parameters 
To  identify  attitudinal  and  behavioural  correlates  of  chemoprophylaxis  failure  or  success, 
including frequency and type of sexual exposure and patterns of adherence. Risk behaviour on- 
and off-study drug was compared. The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was 
used as one index of sexual risk.

Randomisation and treatment  
The  planned  sample  size  was  approximately  3000  subjects  (1500  subjects  per  treatment  group;  see 
below). Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FTC/TDF tablets (Truvada) or matched 
placebo tablets and were to remain on study drug until the target number of seroconversion events was 
identified and the last enrolled subject completed 48 weeks of treatment. All subjects were instructed to 
take their assigned tablets once daily without regard to meals.  
Randomisation  was  locally  administered  and  was  stratified  by  site.  The  randomisation  schedule  was 
developed  the  Division  of  Biostatistics  at  the  University  of  California,  San  Francisco,  using  permuted 
blocks  that  randomly  linked  blinded  study  drug  with  study  numbers.  He  was  not  involved  in  data 
management or statistical analysis of the study.  
Each block consisted of 20 randomised treatment assignments, equally divided into 10 FTC/TDF and 10 
placebo. Extra numbers were given a random assignment, to be used as reserve. Based on enrolment, 
study drugs were shipped to sites in these blocks during the study, and sites were instructed to dispense 
study drug consecutively by using the lowest kit number first (this process was known to be generally 
followed).  
This system maintained treatment balance within sites and also allowed for a dynamic allocation of drug 
across sites to accommodate changes in accrual plans.  
Subjects were to be unblinded to their drug only at the close of the trial. Subjects who developed HIV 
infections  or  discontinued  study  early  were  not  unblinded  at  the  time  of  the  event.  The  DSMB  was 
provided with the unblinded product coding information with study reports upon their request. However, 
the routine work of the DSMB was carried out according to randomisation codes (Group A versus B) and 
without knowledge of treatment.  
Adherence 
Blinded study medication was dispensed at baseline and at each study visit. Pill use was monitored by 
subject  self-report  during  an  interview,  by  clinic-based  pill  counts  at  visits  when  pills  were  either 
dispensed  or  suspended,  and  by  comparing  the  number  of  pills  dispensed  at  each  visit  with  the  time 
interval  between  visits  (dispensation  adherence).  All  subjects  were  instructed  to  return  unused  study 
medication in the original container at each post baseline study visit. Estimates of pill use by pill count 
assumed that no pills were taken from unreturned bottles (lower estimate) or that all pills were taken 
from unreturned bottles (higher estimate). The higher estimate was used in the as treated analysis.  
At  all  on-treatment  visits,  subjects  received  counselling  encouraging  daily  pill  use,  including  the 
importance of taking the pill every day. An interactive, client-centred, motivational interviewing based 
approach  for  study  pill  use  was  implemented  for  all  subjects  starting  between  November  2009  and 
February  2010.  This  approach  separated  adherence  assessment  from  counselling,  to  address  social 
desirability  bias  in  adherence  reporting  and  to  focus  explicitly  on  barriers  and  facilitators  of  pill  use, 
regardless of subjects’ reported level of use. 
Drug concentration measurements were conducted in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 
subjects with documented 2 matched uninfected case controls.  
• 
• 
Plasma  samples  for  possible  assessments  of  FTC/TDF  concentrations  were  collected  from  all 
subjects  at  baseline,  every  12  weeks  during  the  period  of  study  drug  administration,  at  the 
seroconversion visit, at the end-of-study visit and at every post study-drug follow-up visit. 
PBMC  samples  for  possible  assessments  of  FTC/TDF  concentration  were  collected  from  all 
subjects  at  baseline,  every  24  weeks  during  the  period  of  study  drug  administration,  at  the 
seroconversion visit, at the end-of-study visit and at every post study-drug follow-up visit.

At  the  University  of  Colorado  plasma  TFV  and  FTC  concentrations  were  assayed  with  a  validated 
LC-MS-MS method that had a quantification range 10 to 1500 ng/mL for both agents. Intracellular TFV-DP 
and FTC-TP were assayed with a validated LC-MS-MS procedure using viably cryopreserved PBMCs. The 
quantifiable  range  for  TFV-DP  was  2.5  to  2000  fmol/sample  and  that  for  FTC  was  0.10  to  200 
pmol/sample. Results were adjusted for cell viability and reported as fmol or pmol per million viable cells. 
Both assay methods had been reviewed by the DAIDS CPQA.  
Case detection 
An HIV testing algorithm was developed to standardise the process, as shown in Figure 1.  
The algorithm provided a means by which pre-existing HIV infections could be identified after enrolment, 
supporting the validity of the ITT analysis because any seroconversion identified during the study could be 
retrospectively “started” at the time of study entry if it was the result of pre-study infections. Further, an 
HIV Events Committee was established to review all events and to adjudicate any events that could not be 
confirmed through the algorithm.

Other study procedures 
Standard safety monitoring was performed, including assessment of AEs, clinical laboratory tests, and 
periodic physical examinations. Assessments of BMD and bone biochemical markers were performed in a 
subset. 
Statistical approaches 
The  planned  sample  size  of  3000  subjects  (1500  per  group)  was  estimated  to  produce  the  minimum 
target of 85 incident HIV infection events considered sufficient to yield a power of at least 80% with a 
1-sided α = 0.05 to reject a null hypothesis of efficacy of 30% or less if the true efficacy were 60% or 
more.

The all randomised analysis set was used for safety analyses. 
The  ITT  analyses  censored  at  baseline  those  who  did  not  have  at  least  1  on-study  HIV 
assessment. 
The mITT analysis set was used for the primary efficacy analysis and included all available data. 
Those who were not followed and those who had detectable HIV-RNA in their enrolment sample 
were censored at baseline.  
The  secondary  efficacy  analysis  set  was  used  for  the  as-treated  analysis.  This  used  a 
time-dependent  covariate  indication  as  to  whether  the  subject  was  known  to  fall  below  the 
pre-specified level of study-drug adherence (50%) based on records of study drug dispensation, 
pill-use calculation on the basis of study-drug dispensation and returns or subjects’ self-report. 
For the as-treated analysis, pills from unreturned bottles were assumed to have been taken, and 
late visits were included in the analysis if the last dispensation allowed pill use on 50% or more of 
days. 
Adjustments for multiple comparisons were not required because the primary efficacy endpoint of HIV-1 
seroconversion was analysed at the primary analysis time point for the first time. 
The MAH calculated CrCLCG. The iPrEx team calculated treatment adherence.  
The primary analysis of efficacy was based on the incidence of HIV infection (as defined in the algorithm 
shown above) in the mITT analysis set. For cases in which subject infection status could not be resolved 
by the algorithm because of unavailable specimens, the HIV Events Committee adjudicated whether there 
was sufficient evidence to conclude that HIV infection occurred.  
Testing proceeded sequentially, starting with the sample immediately preceding the positive sample. If a 
prior HIV RNA test gave a value that was ≥ LL of its dynamic range, the date of that test was considered 
the date of HIV infection. If all prior tests gave values < LL of the dynamic range or if no prior plasma 
sample  was  available,  the  date  of  first  evidence  of  HIV  infection  was  considered  the  date  of  the  first 
reactive HIV antibody test. Some subjects required additional testing to verify their HIV status and 3 
additional visits could be required to satisfy the requirements of the algorithm. The date of first evidence 
of HIV infection was defined as the date of the first reactive HIV test or date of first positive HIV RNA test, 
whichever was earlier. Subjects who did not test antibody positive were censored at the time of their last 
negative antibody test. 
A Cox model stratified by study site using the Efron method for ties was fit to estimate β, the log hazard 
ratio  comparing  the  observed  infection  incidence  in  subjects  randomized  to  receive  FTC/TDF  to  the 
corresponding incidence observed in subjects assigned to placebo. The estimate was stratified by study

site.  The  efficacy  measure  was  the  relative  effectiveness  (RE),  which  was  identical  to  the  measure 
“vaccine efficacy” used in HIV vaccine studies. The RE was defined as 100 x (1-exp[β]). The estimated RE 
was reported with Wald-based 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Two hypotheses were tested: 
• 
• 
The test of any efficacy  was based on a log-rank test comparing the distributions of infection 
times between treatment groups. The null hypothesis was zero efficacy with a 1-sided alternative 
hypothesis of positive efficacy. The significance level for rejection of the null hypothesis was set 
at 0.025. 
The test of at least 30% efficacy consisted of a 1-sided Wald test of H0: RE = 0.30 (β = -.356) 
versus H1: RE > 0.30 (β < -.356). This test was equivalent to calculating a 1-sided 0.05 level 
Wald-based CI and refuting 30% efficacy if the upper bound of the CI was β <-.356. 
Because there was a theoretical possibility that study treatment masked rather than prevented infection, 
an additional sensitivity analysis was planned (to be conducted at the end of the study) using methods 
described above that included all HIV results up to 8 weeks after the blinded study treatment period, even 
if the subject did not have HIV RNA detected in their last plasma sample taken while on study drug. The 
8-week  window  was  specified  to  provide  for  a  sufficient  duration  of  time  in  which  to  capture 
treatment-emergent HIV infections that occurred during the study period that were not detectable using 
HIV rapid testing through the last on-treatment study visit and confirmatory testing according to the HIV 
testing  algorithm.  This  assessment  was  conducted  in  addition  to  the  seroconversion  assessment 
performed at end of study drug dosing (defined as the monthly visit following the date that the last 30-day 
supply  was  dispensed;  the  “8-weeks-post-stop”  time  point  was  8  weeks  after  the  end  of  study  drug 
dosing. 
Similar methods used for the mITT analysis were utilized to perform an ITT analysis. The p-value from the 
ITT  analysis  is  valid  for  comparing  treatment  groups  as  the  procedure  for  determining  the  time  of 
seroconversion,  as  specified  by  the  follow-up  HIV  testing  algorithm  includes  retrospective  testing  if 
seroconversion occurs within the first 12 weeks after randomisation and study drug dispensation. Thus, 
the  ITT  analysis  considers  all  HIV  infections  (including  those  determined  to  be  at  baseline)  as 
seroconversion events. 
An assessment of the assumption of proportional hazards was performed using the test and graphical 
methods of Grambsch and Therneau and no evidence of non-proportionality was evident through the 1 
May 2010 cut off (p = 0.48). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
Among  subjects  who  acquired  HIV-1  infection  during  the  study,  additional  testing  was  performed  to 
assess  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  mutant  HIV-1  strains.  Formal  comparisons  between  the  2 
populations were based on Fisher’s exact test. The relative risk of occurrence of a resistant virus and the 
associated exact 95% CI also was calculated. 
Interim analysis and DSMB 
The  DSMB  met  at  least  yearly  according  to  the  NIH/DAIDS  multinational  DSMB  schedule  of  meeting 
dates. The DSMB examined safety data, and was provided with information about subject safety including 
abnormal labs, signs and symptoms and social harms. The rates of these were compared between the 
randomisation  groups  (group  A  versus  group  B)  to  allow  continued  blinding  of  the  DSMB  using 
Chi-squared and/or log-rank tests. The treatment groups that were linked to the randomisation codes 
were available in a sealed envelope to the DSMB, and were to be opened at the discretion of the DSMB. 
In addition, listings and tabulations of all study AEs were updated and provided for DSMB review.

The Protocol Safety Review Team examined toxicities and conferred with the principal investigator and 
study  statistician.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  safety  reviews,  the  officer  could  call  for  an  emergency 
meeting of the DSMB to review the safety data. No statistical bounds for recommending a study hold 
based on safety were specified. 
Results – iPrEx interim analysis  
This report includes data for the primary study analysis in the database as of 20 August 2010, which 
comprised study visits completed through 01 May 2010. Available follow-up seroconversion results for the 
end of treatment and through 8-week period after the last dose of study drug are also provided up to the 
cut-off of 21 November 2010. No study drug was dispensed after 31 July 2010.  
Conduct of the study 
The  study  was  conducted  at  11  study  sites  in  6  countries.  Protocol  oversight  was  co-chaired  by  the 
Gladstone  Institute  of  Virology  and  Immunology  (San  Francisco)  and  the  Investigaciones  Medicas  en 
Salud (Lima).   
Table 6.  Randomization Totals by Study Site 
Enrolment started with Version 3 of the protocol. Prior to enrolling the first participant, a decision was 
made  to  expand  the  study  to  allow  observation  of  at  least  85  seroconversion  events.  The  expanded 
protocol projected  that  3000  persons  followed  for  at  least  48  weeks  would  be  needed  to  observe  the 
targeted 85 events. In November 2009, the DAIDS multinational DSMB concluded that the fewer than 
3000 would be sufficient to generate the required number of events and enrolment was closed on 17 
December 2009 at 2499 persons. Without access to interim findings, NIH decided that visits through 01 
May 2010 would comprise the primary analysis of safety and efficacy.  
An additional amendment (Protocol Version 5, implemented March 2011) provided for the termination of 
placebo  administration  and  initiation  of  or  extension  of  FTC/TDF.  Version  5  was  intended  for 
implementation only if FTC/TDF was found to be superior to placebo based on the primary study analysis 
or other studies of chemoprophylaxis.

Important protocol deviations were defined as enrolment of an ineligible subject, dispensation of incorrect 
study medication, or any  subject who  never returned for an on-study visit. There were valid protocol 
violations in 37 subjects (16 [1%] FTC/TDF and 21 [2%] placebo). The 4 events of incorrect study drug 
dispensation occurred in the placebo group and in all cases the subjects received placebo as assigned. 
Most protocol violations were considered to be minor deviations that did not affect the quality of the data. 
Relevant protocol deviations were proportionally distributed between treatment groups and no subject 
violated more than 1 eligibility criterion. 
Population studied  
Subject  disposition  is  shown  in  Table  7.  Of  the  2499  randomised  subjects  12-13%  per  group  had 
discontinued for some reason up to the May 01 2010 cut-off point. 
Attendance at the quarterly study visits was high (~ 90% at each time point). There were no significant 
trends  in  study  visit  completion  rates  over  time.  Overall,  subjects  were  followed  for  assessment  of 
HIV-seroconversion for 3324 person-years with variable duration of observation. The median (Q1, Q3) 
duration of exposure was 62.3 (36.9, 100.3) weeks (FTC/TDF 62.3 weeks and placebo 62.2 weeks).

Most subjects reported that they did not know their randomisation group at Week 12, and those who 
guessed they were assigned to placebo or FTC/TDF were evenly distributed. 
Table 8.  CO-US-104-0288: Perceived Group Assignment At Week 12 By Randomized Treatment Group 
(iPrEx Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
Note: Perceived group assignment was recorded on a computer assisted structured interview at the Week 12 visit. The majority of subjects responded they 
did not know their randomization group. The responses were evenly distributed by group (p = 0.60 by Fisher exact test) indicating the integrity of the blinding. 
Analysis excludes 148 subjects (81 FTC/TDF, 67 placebo) with no Week 12 CASI results. 
The age ranged from 18 to 67 years with means of 27.5 years FTC/TDF and 26.8 years placebo. No 
notable differences between treatment groups were observed in demographics and baseline 
characteristics. Among hepatitis B virus (HBV) susceptible subjects at screening, 94% accepted 
vaccination. Thirteen subjects with chronic HBV infection detected at screening were enrolled in the study 
and 3 additional acute HBV infections were detected as AEs after enrolment when elevated liver 
transaminases were observed (2 in the FTC/TDF group). These events resolved to immunity against HBV. 
Treatment adherence 
There were 21 subjects who temporarily stopped study medication to receive post exposure treatment (8 
FTC/TDF group and 13 placebo; p = 0.28).  
Self-reported pill use was lower in the FTC/TDF group at Week 4 (mean 89% vs. 92%; p < 0.001) and 
Week 8 (93% vs. 94%; p = 0.006) but was comparable thereafter (mean 95% in both groups). At each 
visit ~ 6% did not report numbers of pills missed.  
Pill use estimated by pill count increased over the first 8 weeks, then remained stable at a median of 89% 
(lower estimate) to 95% (upper estimate). According to pill dispensations and quantities, overall pill use 
decreased from 99% to 91% over the first year, a trend that contrasts with pill counts and self-reports, 
in which pill use increased. Mean (SD) adherence by self-reported pill counts through the last visit 
preceding 01 May 2010 was 88.7% (18.1%) for FTC/TDF and 89.6% (17.6%) for placebo. 
In a post hoc assessment of the correlation between subject-reported adherence from the entire study 
cohort (n = approximately 2045) and objective exposure based on drug concentrations using LC/MS/MS 
testing of PBMC samples from a representative subgroup (179 samples obtained at Week 24 from the 
FTC/TDF group), low or missing self-reported adherence was predictive of no quantifiable TFV-DP or 
FTC-TP exposure but high reported adherence was poorly predictive of TFV-DP or FTC-TP drug exposure. 
Among the samples tested, the detection rate for TFV-DP or FTC-TP was 97% for subjects from US sites 
compared with 50% for non-US-based subjects (p < 0.0001). The detection rate for TFV-DP or FTC-TP 
was 73% for those aged ≥ 25 years vs. 44% for those aged < 25 years (p < 0.001).

Primary analysis 
HIV rapid testing was performed at 39,613 visits, among which there were false reactive tests for 3 
subjects at 7 visits; each subject had multiple negative tests afterward. HIV seroconversion was observed 
in 110 persons, of whom 10 had plasma HIV RNA subsequently detected in specimens obtained at the 
enrolment visit. The other 100 HIV-infected subjects had < 40 copies/mL plasma HIV RNA before 
seroconversion and were distributed as shown below

a p-values by logrank test. 
Note: the lower bound of the 1-sided 95% CI is 21% and 27% for the mITT and ITT analyses, respectively (Gilead analysis) 
The iPrEx and MAH analyses gave lower bounds of the 95% CI above zero but below 30% for the mITT 
and ITT datasets.  After adjustment for the difference in age between the 2 groups, the efficacy was 43% 
(95% CI: 14% to 62%).  
There was no evidence of loss of efficacy with longer duration of follow-up, with minimal impact on the 
p-value for testing the null hypothesis of any efficacy.

Figure 2.  CO-US-104-0288: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Time to HIV Infection (iPrEx mITT Analysis) 
The cumulative probability of HIV acquisition is shown for the two groups. The efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (FTC-TDF) was 44 %, as compared with placebo (P-0.005). The inset graph shows a more detailed version of overall graph up to a probability of 
0.10. 
At end of treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment Truvada demonstrated a reduced rate of HIV-1 infection 
relative to placebo in the mITT and ITT analysis sets. As observed in the analysis at the primary time 
point, the null hypothesis of efficacy of 30% or less could not be rejected based on the iPrEx or MAH’s 
analyses.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
HIV RNA concentrations and CD4+ T-cell counts in those with seroconversion were similar over time 
(through Week 60, the last time point available) between treatment groups. 
Among the 10 subjects in whom plasma HIV-1 RNA was subsequently detected in specimens obtained at 
enrolment 2/2 in the FTC/TDF group and 1/8 in the placebo group had FTC-resistant virus. FTC resistance 
waned rapidly after FTC/TDF was discontinued. No TDF-resistant virus was observed in either treatment 
group. Five of the 10 had symptoms of an acute viral syndrome at enrolment, 2 had symptoms 1 week 
later, 1 had an anal sore and 2 had leukopenia at enrolment. 
Among the subjects with HIV-1 seroconversion in the primary analysis, no FTC or TDF resistance was 
detected. In a post hoc assessment using drug-resistance assays based on allele-specific PCT (LLQ 0.5%) 
sensitive for the detection of minor sequence variants (RT K65R, K70E, M184V and M184I), no minor drug 
resistant variants were detected among subjects in the FTC/TDF group.  
After discontinuation of study drug, seroconversion rates were similar among 320 subjects (161 FTC/TDF, 
159 placebo through the 01 May 2010 cut-off; p = 0.42). These 320 subjects had a total of 1173 visits for 
HIV-1 testing after the discontinuation of a study drug (642 FTC/TDF, 531 placebo) through the 01 May 
2010 cut-off. During this timeframe, 5 had seroconversion (2 FTC/TDF). 
Other analyses of efficacy 
As with the mITT and ITT analyses, efficacy of < 30% could not be ruled out in the pre-specified 
as-treated analysis at 50% pill use (p = 0.09). However, among subjects who reported a high degree (≥ 
90%) of adherence the null hypothesis was rejected.

Further support for the correlation between adherence and treatment effect was derived from 
pre-specified evaluations of HIV-1 seroconversion rates by plasma TFV or intracellular TFV=DP levels. 
Subjects without quantifiable PBMC TFV-DP but with high TFV plasma levels were assumed to have 
missed several days/weeks but to have taken study drug just prior to the study visit. 
Figure 3 demonstrates a high correlation between quantifiable intracellular TFV-DP and FTC-TP or plasma 
FTC and TFV concentrations and reductions in HIV-1 infection with FTC/TDF vs. placebo and vs. subjects 
with no quantifiable concentrations. In the FTC/TDF group, the odds of HIV-1 infection was reduced by a 
factor of 12.9 (95% CI: 1.7 to 99.3; p < 0.001) for those with quantifiable concentrations. This finding 
corresponds to a relative reduction in HIV risk of 92% (95% CI: 40% to 99%; p < 0.001) in subjects with 
quantifiable levels. After adjusting for unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) the effect persisted, 
with a 95% relative risk reduction (95% CI: 70% to 99%; p < 0.001) in subjects with quantifiable levels 
compared with those without quantifiable levels.

The figure below summarises the findings. In particular, efficacy was higher among subjects who reported 
at screening that they had previously had URAI (58%; 95% CI: 32% to 74%) than among those who did 
not (-59%; 95% CI: -284% to 34%). There was no significant between-group difference in protection on

confidence intervals (shown by horizontal lines) that do not cross 1 indicate significant evidence of efficacy. All subgroup analyses were prespecified except for 
testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) at screening and pill use at the rate of 90%. P values for the intention-to-treat analysis and the modified 
intention-to-treat analysis apply to the hypothesis of any evidence of efficacy; P values for other comparisons refer to the hypothesis that efficacy differed 
between the two strata. NA denotes not applicable, and URAI unprotected receptive anal intercourse.

The  addendum  includes  cumulative  efficacy  data  through  21  November  2010  (double-blind  primary 
analysis  plus  data  through  the  end  of  the  double-blind  treatment  period).  This  is  referred  to  as  the 
complete  double-blind  analysis.  After  31  July  2010  subjects  were  asked  to  return  any  unused  study 
medication and to present to the clinic for 2 more monthly visits to monitor HIV-1 seroconversion. 
Between 01 May 2010 and 21 November 2010 an additional 304 subjects (149 FTC/TDF, 155 placebo) 
had discontinued from the study, giving a total of 613 discontinuations.

Overall, median (Q1, Q3) adherence by self-reported pill counts through the last visit preceding 21

The ITT analytic approach utilized by UCSF considered all seroconversion events up to the first visit after 
01 August 2010 as part of the End of Treatment analysis. The cut-off date for the End of Treatment + 8 
Weeks analysis is 21 November 2010. Similar trends in relative risk reduction to those observed for the

Between 21 November 2010 and 28 February 2011, 4 participants in the DEXA sub-study additionally 
tested positive for HIV infection at their DEXA 24-week post-stop study drug scan. The iPrEx endpoint 
committee adjudicated 3 as events (one in the FTC/TDF group). The HIV test result from the fourth 
subject (FTC/TDF group) was considered to be a false positive but the case was awaiting further testing 
and final adjudication by the endpoint committee. These 3 adjudicated seroconversion events were not 
included in the complete double-blind analysis but they were included in the database provided to the US 
FDA.  
The MAH performed sensitivity analyses of relative risk reduction that only included data from subjects 
while on treatment during the double-blind period (data through the last dose of study drug; mITT 
analysis set). For the On-Treatment analysis, the cut-off was therefore the last dose of study drug. For the 
On-Treatment + 8 Weeks analysis, the cut-off was the last dose of study drug plus 56 days. Results for 
the On-Treatment and On-Treatment + 8 Weeks analyses of relative risk reduction were consistent with 
the corresponding mITT analyses performed by the UCSF statistical team. 
Updated analyses in the addendum include the plasma or intracellular FTC/TDF levels in the nested 
case-control study. The original design included all with HIV seroconversion regardless of treatment 
assignment. Each subject with HIV seroconversion was matched by site and weeks since enrolment to two 
controls (one from the FTC/TDF arm and one from the placebo arm). In September 2010 the study chair, 
at the request of the protocol pharmacologist, who had no knowledge of or access to the data, approved 
the discontinuation of all testing on placebo-treated subjects with seroconversion and their corresponding 
controls. The FTC/TDF-treated subjects with seroconversion and their corresponding controls were 
included in the updated design, which included testing plasma and PBMCs in specimens obtained closest 
to the time of infection. Each FTC/TDF-treated subject with seroconversion was matched (by site and 
weeks since enrolment) with 2 random controls and 1 control who reported URAI in a period that covered 
the specimen date for the control.

Other outcome measures 
To assess whether participation in the study impacted attitudinal and behavioural correlates that could 
impact failure or success of chemoprophylaxis the study included pre-specified evaluations of sexual 
practices and an assessment of the prevalence of STIs. The number of sexual partners with whom 
respondents had receptive anal intercourse decreased after study enrolment, and the percentage of those 
partners who used a condom increased with similar results in each treatment group at each time point. No 
significant between-group differences were found in the incidence of syphilis (p = 0.49), gonorrhoea (p = 
0.74), chlamydia (p = 0.43), genital warts (p = 0.53) or genital ulcers (p = 0.62) during follow-up. 
iPrEx Open Label Extension (Grant et al., Lancet ID 2014) 
In this open label cohort study 1526/1678 eligible subjects were MSM who had previously been enrolled 
in iPrEx and avoided acquisition of HIV-1. Other subjects came from two other studies in men and 
transgender women who have sex with men.   
Participants were told their randomised assignment in the prior study before enrolment at which time they 
were offered daily Truvada. Subjects were followed in the same way irrespective of whether they chose to 
take PrEP. Visits were at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 and subjects could start PrEP at any visit 
up to 48 weeks, after which they were followed up to 72 weeks on study (off or on PrEP). Counselling was 
provided. Drug concentrations were assessed in plasma at one visit during the first 12 weeks after 
receiving PrEP and analysed in case-cohort design. Subjects were tested for HIV antibodies at all visits 
and for STIs every 24 weeks or if they had symptoms. HIV incidence on and off PrEP was assessed using 
a Poisson model (with a robust SE), enabling comparison between randomised and open-label periods.  
The study finally enrolled 1603 HIV-negative subjects of whom 1225 (76%) received PrEP. Uptake was 
higher in those reporting URAI (416/519 [81%] vs. 809/1084 [75%], p=0.003). Retention in the study 
was not associated with receipt of PrEP (945/1128 [84%] vs. 312/378 [83%], p=0.42). PrEP treatment 
was interrupted 380 times in 365 subjects due to reasons other than LTFU, end of study or HIV infection.  
There were 41 subjects infected with HIV during the study, including 13 not receiving PrEP and 28 
receiving PrEP. Of those receiving PrEP, HIV incidence was 1.8 infections per 100 p-y, compared with 2.6 
infections per 100 p-y in those who concurrently did not choose PrEP (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–1.01, 
adjusted for sexual behaviours). These rates compare with 3.9 infections per 100 p-y in the placebo group 
of the previous randomised phase in iPrEx (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31–0.77).  
Considering only participants from iPrEx, the HIV incidence on PrEP was 53% (95% CI 26 to 70) lower 
than in the placebo group of the randomised phase (3.93 infections per 100 p-y) and 51% (95% CI 23 to 
69) lower than during the gap between the randomised phase and the OLE (3.81 infections per 100 p-y). 
Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in dried blood spots were strongly associated with HIV 
incidence among those receiving PrEP. HIV incidence was 4.7 infections per 100 p-y if drug was not 
detected in dried blood spots, 2.3 infections per 100 p-y if concentrations suggested use of <2 tablets per 
week, 0.6 per 100 p-y for use of 2-3 tablets per week and zero for use of ≥ 4 tablets per week 
(p<0.0001).

Figure 4.  Pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV incidence 
For those visits on PrEP, the incidence of HIV is estimated by exponential regression by tenofovir diphosphate in dried blood spots. The incidence for the concomitant off -PrEP group is 
depicted as a constant for reference. The dotted lines represent the estimate bounded by 1 SE. Dosing for each interval is estimated by pharmacokinetic modelling. LLOQ=lower limit of 
quantitation. 
TFV-DP concentrations in dried blood spots were higher among subjects of older age, with more years of 
schooling, reporting URAI, with more sexual partners, a history of syphilis or herpes, any HIV-positive 
sexual partner or lower estimated CrCL. The effect of age was not explained by differences in estimated 
CrCL.

Table 19.  Predictors of drug concentration in dried blood spot 
Plasma TFV was determined at one of weeks 4 (n=305), 8 (n=851) or 12 (n=33). In those who received 
PrEP TFV was detected in 71% but varied by study region (83% in the USA, 77% in Brazil, 63% in Peru, 
62% in Ecuador, 68% in South Africa and 80% in Thailand. These proportions were similar to that in the 
first 8 weeks of the randomised phase of iPrEx trial (70%; 60% after weighing for sampling fraction). In 
63 subjects who were tested during both phases of the iPrEx study, drug detection increased in Peru from 
44% (28/63) in the randomised phase to 63% (40/63) in the OLE (p=0.02).

The authors concluded that PrEP uptake was high when made available free of charge by experienced 
providers. The effect of PrEP was increased by greater uptake and adherence during periods of higher 
risk. Drug concentrations in dried blood spots were strongly correlated with protective benefit.  
People who more often engaged in risky sexual practices and who had sexually transmitted infections 
were more likely to join the study, more likely to choose PrEP, and more likely to have sustained 
protective levels of PrEP use. Such preferential use of PrEP during times of greater risk shows subject’s 
capacity to recognise and respond appropriately to risks.   
Discordant couples study – Partner’s PrEP (CO-US-104-0380) 
The sponsor of this study was the University of Washington, Seattle. The MAH provided study drug and 
matching placebo. 
The CSR covers data from the blinded treatment phase up to the data cut used for the study primary 
efficacy endpoint (through 10 July 2011; data are reported up to 18 August 2011). On July 2010 the 
placebo group was discontinued but the active treatment groups remained blinded to assignment.  
Methods 
This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of PrEP with either TDF or FTC/TDF administered once daily. The study evaluated the prevention 
of  HIV-1  acquisition  among  HIV-1  uninfected  individuals  within  a  known  HIV-1  sero-discordant 
heterosexual partnership. The study was initiated in July 2008 and was conducted in Kenya (4 sites) and 
Uganda (5 sites). In this endpoint-driven study subjects were to be followed for a minimum of 24 months 
and a maximum of 36 months.  
The primary objectives were: 
• 
• 
To determine if PrEP with TDF or FTC/TDF provides additional protection over standard measures 
against HIV-1 acquisition in uninfected persons within heterosexual HIV-1 discordant couples 
To assess the safety of TDF or FTC/TDF by comparing rates of AEs vs. placebo 
The secondary objectives were: 
1) Factors influencing efficacy 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate efficacy by frequency of sexual activity and HIV-1 viral load in the infected partner 
To assess efficacy by gender of the HIV-1 uninfected partner 
To  measure  the  effect  on  efficacy  of  CD4  count  of  the  HIV-1  infected  partner  and,  for  both 
partners, HSV-2 serostatus, STIs and male circumcision 
2) Adherence 
• 
• 
To assess adherence and the effect of adherence on efficacy  
To evaluate the frequency of PrEP drug sharing between the HIV-1 uninfected and HIV-1 infected 
partners by drug assays  
3) Risk compensation 
• 
• 
To characterise sexual behaviour change of HIV-1 uninfected individuals  
To compare risk behaviours among HIV-1 discordant couples previously enrolled in the Partners 
in Prevention study (which evaluated the efficacy of HSV-2 suppressive therapy when given to the 
HIV-1  infected  partner  for  preventing  HIV-1  transmission),  by  examining  changes  in  sexual 
behaviours when the HIV-1 infected versus HIV-1 uninfected partner is receiving a study drug

4) Safety 
To assess the effect of chemoprophylaxis on the rate of congenital abnormalities  
5) Effect of PrEP on early HIV-1 disease 
To assess the effect of study drug on plasma HIV-1 viral load and CD4 cell counts in the first 12 months 
after seroconversion and assess phenotypic antiretroviral drug resistance 
Selection criteria 
The study was conducted in heterosexual HIV-1 sero-discordant couples in which the uninfected partner 
could be male or female. Enrolment criteria were evaluated through study screening procedures. Eligible 
partners were enrolled within 56 days of screening and were followed at 4-week intervals for evidence of 
HIV-1 seroconversion, adherence to the study drug and clinical toxicity. Laboratory measures of safety 
were performed quarterly.  
Partner subjects (HIV-1 Uninfected) 
•  Aged 18-65 years with negative HIV-1 rapid tests at screening and enrolment  
• 
Part  of  a  heterosexual  couple  in  which  one  partner  met  the  study  eligibility  criteria  for  index 
subjects (see below). The couple had to be sexually active (vaginal intercourse at least 6 times in 
Total bilirubin ≤1.5xULN AND ALT and AST <2xULN 
prior 3 months with plans to remain in the relationship for the duration of the study period. 
•  CrCLCG ≥60 mL/min AND serum creatinine ≤1.3 mg/dL for men and 1.1 mg/dL for women 
• 
•  ANC >1300/mm3, platelets >125,000/mm3 and Hb >11 g/dL 
•  Negative hepatitis B surface antigen test 
•  Not pregnant or breastfeeding 
•  Other exclusion criteria were similar to those in the iPrEx study 
Index Subjects (HIV-1 Infected) 
As above except HIV-1 infected (positive EIA), CD4 cell count ≥250 cells/mm3 and did not otherwise meet 
national  guidelines  for  initiation  of  ART  with  no  history  of  AIDS-defining  diagnoses.  Subjects  were 
excluded if they were on ART.  
Randomisation and treatment 
The  randomisation  code  was  generated  and  maintained  by  the  Protocol  Biostatistician  or  designee.  A 
block randomisation scheme using a block size of 30 was implemented. Blocks were assigned to sites and 
drug  kits  were  shipped  as  needed  to  ensure  reliability  of  the  drug  supply.  Subjects  received  their 
identification numbers in sequential order as they entered the study at each site and were randomized to 
study kit in block order within each site using a telephonic system. Every 6 months, designated study staff 
members accessed the telephonic system to dispense an appropriate kit to each subject.  
The HIV-1 uninfected partner within each couple was randomised (1:1:1) to TDF, FTC/TDF or placebo. 
Because TDF and FTC/TDF tablets are dissimilar each subject ingested two tablets daily (either one active 
and one placebo or two placebo).  
At each monthly visit, the study staff assessed subject adherence through a structured interview and 
tablet count and provided adherence counselling to both partners. Adherence messaging was reinforced 
by counsellors, clinicians and pharmacy staff. Weekly pill boxes and other adherence aids were provided.   
No formal pharmacokinetic endpoints were evaluated but a preliminary comparison was conducted of 
detection of tenofovir in plasma among a case-cohort sample of partner subjects who acquired HIV-1 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016

relative  to  partner  subjects  who  did  not  acquire  HIV-1  during  the  study.  No  drug  concentration 
measurements were conducted. 
Blinding 
None of the study staff or investigators had access to the randomisation schedule. At the MAH’s facility 
packaging  and  QA  staff  members  were  unblinded  to  the  bottle  assignments.  Programmers  and 
statisticians at the sponsor were unblinded to provide QA review of the drug kit dispensing system and to 
prepare the DSMB reports.  
Statistical methods 
The  study  used  a  common  placebo  group  for  comparison  to  each  of  the  active  arms  and  aimed  to 
demonstrate efficacy of each regimen separately vs. placebo. Concordant with Phase 3 study designs for 
HIV vaccines, the minimum level of efficacy was considered to be 30%. Therefore the null hypothesis of 
efficacy evaluated in this study was 30% (or less) for each active study drug with the standard Type I 
error rate of 0.05. It was further anticipated that the loss to follow-up rate would be approximately 18% 
(i.e.  7%  per  year)  based  on  results  of  previous  HIV-1  studies  conducted  with  HIV-1  sero-discordant 
couples in East Africa. 
Assuming that the true efficacy of TDF or FTC/TDF would be 60% and HIV-1 incidence rates in the placebo 
group would be between 3.2 and 4 per 100 person-years, calculations indicated that a sample size of 
3900 HIV-1 uninfected subjects (1300 per group) would be expected to yield 191 HIV-1 seroconversion 
events, which would result in 80% power to detect an efficacy between 57% and 60% for each active 
study drug relative to placebo (against the null hypothesis of 30%). Under the same assumptions, 191 
seroconversion events would provide 90% power to detect a true efficacy between 61% and 65%.  
Once the study had initiated, after discussion with the DSMB, the estimated sample size was revised to 
4700  HIV-1  uninfected  subjects  (1566  per  group).  This  decision  was  based  on  new  information  from 
another PrEP study in discordant couples in which the HIV-1 incidence rate was 2.8 per 100 person-years 
in the placebo group. 
The analysis sets were: 
• 
ITT  -  all  randomised  partner  subjects  who  met  the  entry  criteria.  The  safety  analysis  was 
conducted in the ITT cohort 
•  mITT – this cohort was used for the primary efficacy analyses and excluded any partners found to 
be HIV positive at the time of randomisation 
• 
Index subject cohort – used for evaluating correlates of efficacy, drug sharing and transmitted 
resistance 
The  primary  analysis  was  stratified  by  site.  The  only  covariate  included  in  the  model  was  the 
randomisation group. Analyses of the primary study endpoint were performed to test the rate of HIV-1 
acquisition, both combined and separately, between each TDF and FTC/TDF group versus placebo using 
a Cox regression analysis. The randomisation group was the only predictor used in each analysis. The 
same reference group (placebo) was used for each study drug group; however, no multiple comparison 
adjustment was performed.  
Individuals who dropped out of the study, were terminated, refused further testing prior to completion of 
follow-up or died prior to completion of follow-up were non-informatively censored as of their last HIV-1 
test. Following death, subjects were assessed as not expected at all follow-up visits. For all other early 
terminations,  subjects  were  assessed  as  expected  at  all  follow-up  visits,  but  were  not  retained.  No 
imputations for missing data were made in the analyses.  
The  primary  endpoint  was  HIV-1  detection,  calculated  using  the  date  of  first  site-detected 
seroconversion, which was assessed monthly. The event time for HIV infection was the time of the first 
site-detected  positive  HIV-1  antibody  test.  Final  determination  of  seroconversion  and  whether  it

happened after enrolment was based on the Endpoint Committee’s assessment. Consistent with an ITT 
analysis, women who were taken off drug because of pregnancy and breastfeeding, subjects who missed 
follow-up  visits  and  non-adherent  subjects  were  included  in  the  analysis  within  their  original 
randomisation  group  if  endpoint  information  was  available  within  the  protocol-specified  timeframe  of 
follow-up.  
The additional post-study follow-up after the final on-drug visit at 4 and 8 weeks after cessation of study 
drug was not included in on-study follow-up time so test results from this period were excluded from the 
primary analysis. 
If multiple positive tests were available for an individual, the first positive confirmed test was used as the 
time of  seroconversion,  unless  the  endpoints  review  committee  determined another  visit  should  have 
been  used.  Follow-up  time  for  subjects  who  never  seroconverted  to  HIV-1  was  measured  from 
randomisation to last on-study negative HIV-1 test.  
Two formal statistical comparisons between each active study drug and the placebo were performed. The 
first comparison considered the hypothesis of any efficacy (testing the null hypothesis of the hazard ratio 
[HR] being 1). The second comparison considered the hypothesis of less than 30% efficacy (testing the 
null hypothesis of the HR being 0.7); this comparison corresponded to the premise for which the study 
was powered. The significance level for rejection was set at p = 0.05 (2-sided). Thus, 1-sided tests with 
α = 0.025 were used for comparison of each active study drug group with the placebo, with no adjustment 
for multiple comparisons. 
The DSMB was established as a group of independent experts who advised the sponsor and the study 
investigators.  The  primary  responsibility  of  the  DMSB  was  to  periodically  review  and  evaluate  the 
accumulated  study  data  for  safety,  study  conduct  and  progress  and  efficacy.  The  DSMB  also  made 
recommendations to the study investigators and the sponsor concerning the continuation, modification or 
termination of the study. The DSMB considered study-specific data, along with all relevant background 
knowledge about the disease, study drugs and/or patient population under study. The DSMB maintained 
the confidentiality of its internal discussions and activities, as well as the contents of all provided reports. 
Prior  to  study  initiation,  the  DSMB  defined  its  stopping  guidelines,  procedures  for  unblinding,  event 
triggers that would call for an unscheduled review and voting procedures. Guidelines for evaluation of 
futility  were  also  developed.  During  the  study  the  DSMB  reviewed  all  reported  data  at  meetings  that 
occurred  approximately  every  6  months.  Prior  to  study  initiation,  the  schedule  of  efficacy  review  was 
established. It was anticipated that there could be 2-3 interim scheduled efficacy reviews. In developing 
procedures related to study continuation or discontinuation as part of the DSMB charter, several scenarios 
were considered, including: 
•  Decision rules for stopping if both active study drug groups demonstrated efficacy 
•  Decision rules for stopping the study if both active study drug groups demonstrated substantial 
AE rates, compared with the placebo group, including rare but significant AEs 
•  Demonstration  of  efficacy  in  1  of  the  2  active  study  drug  groups  without  (or  prior  to) 
demonstration of efficacy in the other active study drug group, including parameters for the level 
of efficacy to stop follow-up in one group early while continuing follow-up of the remaining group 
•  Demonstration of efficacy in another ongoing PrEP study 
•  Differential rates of AEs, including rare but significant AEs, in either or both of the active study 
drug groups 
Lower than expected HIV-1 incidence rates, lower than expected study drug adherence or higher 
than expected loss to follow-up in any of the study groups 
Possible futility in one or both of the active study drug groups 
• 
• 
Interim monitoring stopping boundaries for proven efficacy were established based on ruling out efficacy 
lower than 30%.

Results – Partner’s PrEP  
Protocol  amendment  version  3.0  was  applied  at  study  initiation.  Version  3.0  was  amended  7  times 
between 03 November 2008 and 14 February 2011, mostly for administrative issues. Substantial changes 
included adding the Jinja site, adding PBMC collection and increasing the study sample size from 3900 to 
4700 (see above). 
There were 4758 couples that met the selection criteria from which ~1580 ITT subjects were assigned to 
each treatment group. Retention of the partner subjects in each study drug group was at least 96% over 
the course of the study. There were 7830 person-years of follow-up for assessment of HIV-1 incidence 
accrued, with a median 23 months of follow-up (IQR 16–28 months). 
Figure 5.  CO-US-104-0380: Disposition of Study Subjects 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the enrolled couples were similar across study groups. 
Partner subjects were predominantly male (61%–64%) with median age of 33 to 34 years. These 
subjects generally had an income (at least 78%), had a median education of 7 years and >90% had not 
had sex with an outside partner in the eligibility period. In general the presence of income was lower 
among the index subjects but was still 67%–68%. Among the index subjects, the median baseline CD4 
count ranged from 491 to 499 cells/mm3 and the median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 3.9 log 10 
copies/mL. 
Couples reported a median of 4 sex acts with 26% to 28% unprotected sex during the month prior to 
enrolment. Most were married (97%–98%) with a median partnership duration of 7.0 to 7.1 years. HIV-1 
sero-discordance had been detected within a median of 0.4–0.5 years prior to study. Similar percentages 
of partner and index subjects (6%–9%) had a curable STI at enrolment and none was pregnant.

Study medication was dispensed at 96% of all attended visits. The most common reasons for not 
dispensing study medication at any visit were pregnancy (30%), possible seroconversion (22%) and 
subject refusal (16%). Renal toxicity accounted for 10% of the reasons for withholding study drug, while 
other AEs accounted for 11% of the reasons.  
Overall, 98% of the dispensed study bottles were returned and 97% of the dispensed study tablets were 
calculated to have been taken (based on pill counts of returned, unused study drug). At 15% of visits it 
was reported that at least 1 dose of study drug had been missed during the prior month, but missing 2 or 
more consecutive doses was reported at only 4% of the visits. Three partner subjects reported that they 
thought their index partner used their study drug. Overall, 87% of the visits at which adherence was 
calculated showed study drug coverage of 90% or more. 
Eleven partner subjects were ineligible and were therefore excluded from the ITT cohort. As of 10 July 
7830 person-years of follow-up time had accumulated in the 4747 eligible HIV-1 partner subjects. During 
this time, 99 site-reported seroconversion events were recorded. Three of the 99 were determined by the 
study endpoint committee based on central laboratory confirmatory testing to be false positives. It was 
later determined that 14 site-reported seroconversion events occurred in partner subjects who were 
HIV-1 RNA PCR-positive at enrolment, leaving 82 seroconversion events in the mITT cohort and a rate of 
1.05 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.30). 
In the mITT cohort, both TDF and FTC/TDF demonstrated significant efficacy compared with placebo while 
TDF and FTC/TDF were not significantly different from one another.

b 0% efficacy represents the p-value for the evaluation of the hypothesis of any efficacy. 30% efficacy represents the p-value for the evaluation of the 
hypothesis of less than 30% efficacy (the premise for which the study was powered). 
Both TDF and FTC/TDF ruled out efficacy of less than 30% relative to placebo, thereby meeting the 
predefined primary efficacy endpoint (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0004, respectively). The HRs for TDF relative 
to placebo indicated a 67% reduction (95% CI: 44%–81%) in risk of HIV-1 acquisition, and the HRs for 
FTC/TDF relative to placebo indicated a 75% reduction (95% CI: 55%–87%) in risk of HIV-1 acquisition. 
In general, results of the efficacy analyses obtained using the ITT cohort were similar to those obtained 
using the mITT cohort.

Abbreviation: CI = 95% confidence interval 
Note: Efficacy (risk reduction) is 1 minus the HR. P-values for heterogeneity of effect. 
The test for homogeneity of treatment effect was statistically significant for the difference in the effect of 
TDF versus placebo in the subgroup defined by CD4 level of the index subjects at enrolment (HR = 0.79 
for < 350 vs. 0.21 for ≥ 350 cells/mm3; p = 0.03) and in the subgroup defined by the partner’s report of 
unprotected sex at enrolment (HR = 0.13 with unprotected sex vs. 0.47 without; p = 0.05).  
Using a case-cohort analysis, detection of tenofovir in plasma samples was compared for partners who 
received active therapy and did or did not acquire HIV-1. The evaluation included all 17 who had taken 
TDF and 12/13 who had taken FTC/TDF. The cohort comparison included 100 randomly-selected partner 
subjects from each of the TDF and FTC/TDF groups (200 subjects in total). Overall, 128 samples were

collected from the case subjects and 902 samples from the controls. Cases were much less likely than 
controls to have detectable TFV in plasma (actual concentrations were not determined). 
Table 23.  CO-US-104-0380: Detection of Tenofovir in Plasma and HIV-1 Prophylactic Effects 
Percentages of HIV-1 seronegative partners who reported having sex without condoms with their HIV-1 
infected partner during the prior month decreased from 27% at baseline to 13% and 9% at 12 and 24 
months, respectively. The results were similar across study drug groups. The percentages who reported 
having sex with an outside partner for any prior month increased from 9% (13% men, 0.4% women) at 
baseline to 30% (42% men, 9% women) during the study, with similar percentages across study drug 
groups.  
Plasma samples for HIV-1 antiretroviral resistance testing were obtained at the visit at which HIV-1 
seroconversion was detected (at which time study medication was withdrawn) and at a second visit within 
1 month of seroconversion. An assessment was possible for 92/96 subjects who seroconverted. Two of 
the 8 in the TDF and FTC/TDF groups found to be infected at randomisation developed resistance to study 
medications, including one with the K65R mutation and one with the M184V mutation. No subjects who 
acquired HIV-1 after randomisation either of these mutations but one in the TDF group developed a rare 
RAM (K65N). Four subjects had virus with mutations K103N or V016A conferring high-level resistance to 
NNRTIs (2 TDF group, 1 FTC/TDF, 1 placebo).  
Approximately 30% of the index subjects reported using ART at some time during study, including 
short-term use for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV-1.  
Partners PrEP OLE (Baeten et al. Lancet Infectious Diseases 2014) 
On July 10 2011 the DSMB recommended that the placebo group should be discontinued because of the 
demonstration of efficacy reported above. The DSMB recommended that follow-up of subjects assigned to 
the active PrEP groups be continued in accordance with protocol-defined procedures and that subjects 
originally assigned to the placebo group should be offered re-randomisation (in a 1:1 ratio) to one of the 
two treatments in a blinded fashion. At the same time, all study subjects were informed of the interim 
efficacy results and those assigned to TDF or Truvada were told they were on active treatment but not 
which one. Thus, all subjects continuing on treatment regardless of the initial randomisation group were 
kept unaware of the exact treatment they received. 
By this means the OLE continued until 30 Dec 2012 and the cumulative data include an additional 3569 
p-y of follow-up and 26 additional HIV-1 infections. 
Overall, 89% of 1418 placebo subjects consented to re-randomisation to TDF or FTC/TDF.  During the 
entire study there were 64 HIV-1 seroconversion events in individuals assigned to active PrEP (39 TDF 
and 25 Truvada). Of the 26 (41%; 17 TDF and 9 Truvada) infections that occurred after 10 July 2011 
there were 12 subjects (8 TDF; 4 Truvada) for whom the archived plasma showed that they had been 
infected at the time of initial randomisation (8) or re-randomisation (4). Thus, 52 infections occurred after

randomisation including 31 in the TDF arm (0.71 per 100 p-y) and 21 in the Truvada arm (0.48 per 100 
p-y); not significant (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39–1.17; p=0.16). HIV-1 incidences in subjects receiving PrEP 
were similar before and after 10 July 2011. HIV-1 incidence in the placebo group before 10 July 2011 was 
2 per 100 p-y. Subgroup analyses also showed no significant differences between active treatments as 
shown below. 
In a per-protocol sensitivity analysis of the periods when study medication was dispensed, 33 HIV-1 
infections occurred (20 TDF; 0.52 per 100 p-y and 13 Truvada; 0.33 per 100 p-y [HR 0.63, 95% CI 
0.31–1.27; p=0.20]). Results were similar for the comparison of HIV-1 incidence in the two PrEP groups 
restricted to periods with a product adherence of at least 80%. 
Tenofovir was detected in a plasma sample obtained during the visit at which HIV-1 seroconversion was 
detected in 14 (27%) of 51 who acquired HIV-1 compared with 1047 (78%) of 1334 samples from 
subjects who did not acquire HIV-1 (see below). Having detectable plasma TFV was associated with an 
estimated relative risk reduction for acquiring HIV-1 of 85% for TDF and 93% for Truvada. 
In most individuals, PrEP use was consistent during follow-up, with a slight decrease in use over time. 
Subjects who acquired HIV-1 generally seroconverted during PrEP non-use.

Viral RNA was amplified for assessment of ART resistance from 60/64 (94%) who acquired HIV-1. Two of 
the 8 subjects retrospectively found to HIV-1 infected at initial randomisation developed HIV-1 with 
resistance to study medications (one K65R and one M184V mutation). Of the 52 who acquired HIV-1 after 
randomisation or re-randomisation, 48 had resistance data and mutations K65R, K70E, M184V or M184I 
were not detected.  
The authors concluded that the results did not rule out the potential for a slight difference in HIV-1 
protection with TDF vs. Truvada. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Resistance 
*In pre-treatment sample 
iPrEx  – Ten subjects had HIV-1 RNA detected in pre-treatment specimens after they were enrolled, of 
which 3 (2 Truvada) had FTC resistance but none had TFV resistance. No resistance was detected in 48 
post-infection samples.  
Partner’s  PrEP – Eight subjects had HIV-1 RNA detected in pre-treatment specimens after they were 
enrolled of which one in the TDF group had the K65R mutation and one in the Truvada group had the 
M184V mutation. No resistance was detected in 24 post-infection samples.

CDC TDF2 – one subject had high-levels of K65R, M184V and A62V (conferring cross-NRTI resistance) 
but this subject had entered the study with unrecognised acute HIV infection. The study team informed 
the  MAH  that  the  subject  had  received  approximately  5  months  of  blinded  Truvada  before  HIV  was 
confirmed. 
•  No resistance was observed in FHI PrEP for 1 of 2 subjects in the TDF group who seroconverted 
and for whom a sample was available.  
•  None of the female subjects who acquired HIV-1 infection developed TFV resistance in CAPRISA 
004.  
•  No subject receiving TDF became infected in CDC 4323. 
Persistence of efficacy 
To  date,  long-term  efficacy  data  on  use  of  Truvada  for  PrEP  do  not  indicate  any  loss  of  effect  or 
detrimental impact on sexual risk factors. The iPrEx OLE study supported efficacy of 84% in subjects who 
were modestly adherent (2 to 3 doses per week) and 86-100% in subjects with higher adherence (≥ 4 
doses per week). Self-reported sexual risk behaviour declined during the study. For example, 34% in the 
Truvada C/TDF group reported URAI at study start compared with 25% at the end of the OLE.  
Supportive studies 
Up to the time of the US filing, the main studies in which daily oral Truvada had been evaluated for PrEP 
were as shown below. The three studies for which CSRs are included in the current application dossier are 
ringed in orange. The CDC4323 study was primarily designed to assess safety although it also reported on 
HIV-1 infection rates. Efficacy data from the CDC TDF2 study are described in the summary of efficacy 
and results are outlined below. 
The FEM-PrEP and VOICE studies were terminated early. Failure to show efficacy was ascribed to low 
adherence.  
The FHI PrEP study evaluated TDF only. It enrolled 936 HIV-negative women at high HIV risk in Ghana, 
Cameroon and Nigeria who were randomised 1:1 to daily TDF or placebo in a double-blind design. There 
were two seroconversion events in the TDF arm (0.86 per 100 person-years) and 6 in the placebo arm 
(2.48 per 100 person-years). This gives a rate ratio 0.35 (95% CI: 0.03 – 1.93). However, the Cameroon

and Nigeria sites closed early due to controversy and logistic issues, respectively, and the trial was not 
powered to demonstrate efficacy. 
Studies  that  evaluated  only  topical  usages  (such  as  CAPRISA)  are  not  relevant  to  daily  oral 
administrations and are not described. 
Since the US approval of Truvada for PrEP there have been very many additional PrEP trials initiated using 
a wide range of strategies including further evaluation of oral Truvada. One of these (PROUD) is described 
briefly based on publications only. 
CDC 4323 (CO-US-104-0277) 
This was a Phase 2 study in MSM sponsored by CDC. The MAH has not received a clinical study report or 
final  datasets  from  the  CDC  4323  study  team  but  provides  a  report  on  the  most  relevant  study 
information that was shared between CDC and the MAH in 2010 and also publications of the study. 
This was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with four equal groups who received TDF 300 
mg orally once daily or matching placebo, either immediately or after a nine-month delay. Subjects were 
followed for two years. It was determined that overall sample size of 400 would be sufficient to have 72% 
to 90% chance of observing at least 5 severe AEs in each treatment group, given 3% to 4% baseline risk 
of severe AE, two-year follow up, and nine-month lead in period for a half of the sample. The delayed 
arms were designed to help assess potential changes in risk behaviour associated with taking study drug 
and the results were reported separately. 
Participants were recruited in San Francisco, Atlanta and Boston. Subjects were to be healthy biologic 
males aged 18-60 years who reported any anal sex with another male in the preceding 12 months. They 
were to be HIV-1 negative by whole blood rapid EIA and HBsAg negative. They were to have calculated 
CrCLCG ≥70 mL/min with normal haematological, biochemical and urinalysis profiles. Exclusion criteria 
included active untreated syphilis; uncontrolled hypertension; mutual monogamy for over one year with 
an  HIV-negative  partner;  history  of  chronic  renal  disease;  osteoporosis,  osteomalacia  or  osteopenia; 
bone mineral density (BMD) Z score < -2.5 at the total spine, total hip or femoral neck on screening 
(DEXA scans done at SFO study site only); current treatment for secondary causes of low bone mineral 
density. 
After randomisation subjects were followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months post- enrolment. 
Delayed arm recipients had an additional visit at ten months (after the first month on study drug). Visits 
included  behavioural  assessment  via  ACASI  and  risk  reduction  and  adherence  counselling.  AEs  and 
laboratory abnormalities (except serum creatinine) were graded using the DAIDS toxicity grading tables 
(January,  2004).  Serum  creatinine  elevations  were  graded  according  to  the  Gilead  Sciences  Modified 
NIAID Common Toxicity Grading Scale, with the additional modification that Grade 1 was defined as ≥0.5 
mg/dL over baseline. For confirmed Grade 1 or 2 creatinine elevations (2.1-3.0 mg/dL), study drug was 
withheld and restarted with return of the serum creatinine to within 0.3 mg/dL above baseline. Confirmed 
recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 elevations led to permanent discontinuation of study product. Confirmed Grade 
3 (3.1-6.0 mg/dL) or Grade 4 (>6.0 mg/dL) elevations led to permanent discontinuation. There were 15 
pre-defined AESIs. 
HIV  testing  with  an  FDA-approved  rapid  test  was  performed  at  each  visit,  followed  by  an  approved 
confirmatory  test  for  preliminary  positives.  Participants  with  positive  rapid  tests  were  immediately 
discontinued  from  study  drug.  Confirmed  seroconversion  led  to  follow-up  every  three  months  for  an 
additional year for safety assessments and referral for appropriate clinical care.

Adherence was assessed by pill counts at each visit, Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps 
and  self-reporting  via  ACASI.  Pill  count  or  MEMS  data  were  used  to  estimate exposure  to  study  drug 
(ESD).  
For pill count and MEMS adherence estimates the time covered by directed temporary drug interruptions 
were excluded from denominators. 
All  participants  were  included  in  baseline  analyses.  The  Treatment  Emergent  (TE)  cohort  included  all 
subjects dispensed study drug. Time in the TE cohort began with first dispensing and ended with the first 
occurrence of completion of follow-up (24 months), 30 days after date of permanent drug interruption or 
30 days after last recorded study visit.  
Analyses considered each individual AE as an outcome variable regardless of relatedness to study drug 
and compared treatment groups by time to first reported AE as well as by occurrence of recurrent AEs. 
In  univariate  analyses,  simple  association  of  each  AE  with  treatment  assignment  was  studied  by 
modelling time to first reported AE using Cox proportional hazards regression. Furthermore, incidence of 
recurrent  AEs  was  compared  between  groups  by  modelling  AE  count  using  generalised  estimating 
equation (GEE) formulation of Poisson regression with total follow-up time used as an offset variable.  
In  multivariable  analysis,  in  addition  to  treatment  assignment  as  the  main  predictor  or  interest  the 
following covariates were included: study site, immediate or delayed arm assignment, age, race, ethnicity 
and EST. Multivariable comparison of time to first AE was performed using the extended Cox model which 
accommodated time-dependent covariate EST. 
To avoid underestimating risk, time to first event analysis was performed by selecting the lowest value of 
ESD between MEMS and pill count estimates calculated for each visit interval. Lowest values were was 
dichotomised at 80%. The choice of such a threshold was arbitrary given currently evolving knowledge on 
PrEP  effectiveness  and  absence  of  established  recommendations.  For  analyses  of  recurrent  events,  a 
summary measure of ESD was obtained by taking the mean value of all available visit-specific estimates 
for each participant. These were also dichotomised at 80%.  
All  statistical  tests  were  two-sided  and  interpreted  at  alpha=0.05  level  of  significance.  Statistical  test 
results were not adjusted for multiplicity.  
Results – CDC 4323 
There were 201 randomised to TDF and 199 to placebo of which 331 (83%) completed all study visits. A 
higher proportion of participants completed all study visits in SFO (180/200; 90%) compared with Atlanta 
(91/121; 75%) and Boston (60/79; 76%) (p=0.0006). There were 373 (93%) in the TE cohort. All 200 in 
the  immediate  arms  initiated  study  drug,  compared  with  173  (87%)  of  200  delayed  arm  participants 
(p<0.001) and 325/373 (87%) completed all study visits. 
Demographic and selected baseline characteristics were distributed similarly among the four study arms 
except for higher proportions of African-American race in the placebo arms.

There were 178 temporary drug interruptions among the 373 participants (84 on TDF and 94 on placebo). 
The median length of temporary drug interruptions for TDF was 37 days (range 2-428 days) vs. 47 days 
(range 1-533 days; p=0.055) for placebo. There were 66 permanent drug interruptions. 
Median exposure to study drug estimated from pill count was 92% (range 79-98 percent). Estimated 
exposure  on  drug  from  MEMS  was  77%  (range  57-92  percent).  When  periods  of  directed  drug 
interruption were removed from this calculation to estimate adherence, results were similar (93% and 
79%, respectively).

There were 7 seroconversion events, all in subjects randomised to placebo. Three occurred while subjects 
were taking placebo, three occurred in delayed arm subjects who had not yet started study drug and one 
was discovered in a screen negative subject found to be seropositive at the one-month visit with a positive 
confirmatory Western blot. Viral load in a stored specimen from the enrolment visit of this subject was 
1,770 copies/mL. No K65R mutations occurred in seroconverting subjects. 
When comparing those subjects who began TDF at enrolment with the groups that commenced treatment 
at 9 months after enrolment, there was no evidence of sexual risk compensation during the study. There 
were greater decreases in the number of occurrences of unprotected anal sex during the first 9 months in 
the former group vs. the latter group (p = 0.04). The plasma concentrations of TDF were not available at 
the time of these analyses and the assessor does not find them reported in the literature.  
CDC TDF2 
The  study  was  conducted  in  high-risk  heterosexual  young  men  and  women.  FTC/TDF  had  an  overall 
protective efficacy of 62.2% (95% CI: 21.5%-83.4%; p = 0.013 vs. placebo [mITT]). In the as-treated 
population, where follow-up was censored at 30 days after the last reported dose of study drug, FTC/TDF 
had a protective efficacy of 77.9% (95% CI: 41.2%-93.6%; p < 0.001).  
In  the  overall  analysis  of  the  33  subjects  who  seroconverted  (mITT;  9  Truvada  and  24  placebo),  the 
number of men using PrEP who became infected with HIV was significantly smaller in the FTC/TDF group 
than in the placebo group (p = 0.026); the treatment group difference for women in the overall analysis 
was not significant (p = 0.107). In the as-treated analysis of the 23 subjects who seroconverted and 
reported taking study drug within 30 days prior to seroconversion, the number of women using PrEP who 
became infected with HIV was significantly smaller in the Truvada group than in the placebo group (p = 
0.021); the treatment group difference for men in the as-treated analysis was not significant (p = 0.065). 
While the p-value for men in the as-treated analysis did not reach significance, the study was not powered 
to draw conclusions based on gender.  
Subjects who received Truvada showed correlations between treatment adherence and protection against 
HIV-1 infection. Among participants randomised to Truvada, TFV was detected in the plasma of 50% of 
seroconverting subjects at the seroconversion visit and in 79.7% of uninfected controls at similar time

points.  Similarly,  FTC  was  detected  in  50%  and  81.2%  of  seroconverting  subjects  and  uninfected 
subjects, respectively.

seroconversion status 
Note: Horizontal black bars indicate estimated geometric mean drug concentrations accounting for all subjects tested (not only those above limits of detection) 
and according HIV seroconversion status. 
Among  those  with  measurable  drug  levels,  the  GMCs  for  plasma  TFV  were  significantly  lower  in 
seroconverting subjects vs. uninfected subjects (0.30 ng/mL [95% CI 0.01-8.02 ng/mL] vs. 30.58 ng/mL 
[95% CI 16.25-57.51 ng/mL]; p = 0.007). The plasma FTC GMC also differed significantly between the 
two groups (0.54 ng/mL [95% CI 0.01-25.32 ng/mL] vs. 103.3 ng/mL [95% CI 45.44-234.86 ng/mL]; p 
= 0.009). Neither TDF nor FTC was detected in plasma of the 19 who seroconverted on placebo. 
Other studies of Truvada for PrEP 
The  HIV  Prevention  Research  and  Development  Database  lists  numerous  completed,  ongoing  and 
planned studies involving the use of Truvada for PrEP in various at-risk populations and in one or both 
genders.  Some  of  these  have  already  reported  important  results,  including  the  PROUD  and  IPERGAY 
studies. IPERGAY concerned “on demand” use of Truvada and not daily prophylaxis and this study has not 
been included or discussed in this application and as a consequence is not described. 
PROUD study in MSM 
The MAH did not provide a CSR for this study conducted by the UK MRC and published in 2015. The MAH 
part funded this study. Since the study evaluated the use of Truvada in MSM a short summary of this 
study is merited in support of the iPrEx study results. In contrast to iPrEx, PROUD was open-label in a 
deliberate  attempt  to  assess  efficacy  in  the  setting  in  which  PrEP  would  be  introduced  into  a 
region/population in which PrEP was not a routine part of risk management in MSM.  
This  open-label  randomised  study  was  conducted  at  13  sexual  health  clinics  in  England  and  enrolled 
HIV-negative MSM who reported anal intercourse without a condom in the previous 90 days. Participants 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily Truvada immediately or after a deferral period of 1 year.

Randomisation was conducted using web-based access to a central computer-generated list with variable 
block sizes (4, 6 or 8; stratified by clinical site). Follow-up was quarterly.  
The study was conducted in a fashion intended to mimic real-life use so that results from local clinical 
laboratories were used and there was no study screening visit. There was an enrolment visit at which the 
relevant data were collected and eligibility criteria were checked.  
PROUD was initially designed to enrol 5000 participants, which would give adequate power to detect a 
50% reduction in HIV incidence from 2.5 to 1.25 infections per 100 person-years. The primary outcomes 
for  the  pilot  phase  were time  to  accrue  500  participants  and  retention;  secondary  outcomes  included 
incident HIV infection during the deferral period, safety, adherence, and risk compensation. For the pilot 
study  there  was  an  arbitrary  10%  sample  size  of  500  and  data  were  initially  monitored  by  a  single 
independent expert not masked to allocation. As it emerged that HIV incidence was much higher than 
anticipated,  an  independent  DMC  was  set  up  in  June,  2014.  The  committee  regarded  the  difference 
between groups in rate of HIV infection as the important measure for public health policy, and adopted a 
lower 2.5% confidence limit greater than two infections per 100 person-years as a threshold for notifying 
the steering committee, although this was not a formal stopping rule. 
Analyses included all participants according to their randomised allocation (ITT) and all except individuals 
with  a  reactive  HIV  antigen–antibody  result  at  enrolment  (mITT).  Incidence  rates  were  compared 
between the two groups by the rate difference and the rate ratio. Exact 90% CIs were used rather than 
95% CIs because the primary interest was in the lower confidence limit. All analyses used data collected 
up to the date of extraction on June 10, 2015. 
Results - PROUD 
The pilot phase enrolled 544 subjects from November 2012 to April 30 2014. There were 275 in the 
immediate group and 269 in the deferred group. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the 
two groups. The median age was 35 years (29–43), 61% were university graduates, 40% were born 
outside of the UK and 30% were living with a partner. In the previous 12 months, 64% had at least one 
STI and 36% had received at least one course of PrEP. Also, 44% had used one or more drugs associated 
with sexual disinhibition in the past 90 days. 
On Oct 13 2014 the steering committee recommended that all deferred participants should be offered 
PrEP. At that time follow-up for HIV incidence was complete for 243 (94%) of 259 patient-years in the 
immediate group versus 222 (90%) of 245 patient-years in the deferred group. Three HIV infections had 
occurred in the immediate group (1.2/100 person-years) vs. 20 in the deferred group (9.0/100 
person-years) despite 174 non-study prescriptions for PrEP in the deferred group (leaving 167 without 
prior use of PrEP). These results give a relative reduction of 86% (90% CI 64–96, p=0·0001) and an 
absolute difference of 7.8/100 person-years (90% CI 4.3–11.3).

participants in the deferred group became eligible for pre-exposure prophylaxis under the original protocol. *Had a stored enrolment sample that tested 
positive for HIV RNA but was retained in the analysis. 
The three incident infections in the PrEP group concerned one subject with a reactive HIV test at the 
4-week visit whose infection is thought to have pre-dated the start of PrEP, one who was HIV reactive at 
61 weeks but had not been prescribed study drug since enrolment and one who had a seroconversion 
illness at 53 weeks but had not been prescribed drug that would have covered use beyond ~week 24.  
Questionnaires about sexual behaviour in the previous 90 days were available for 534 at baseline and 406 
participants at 1 year. The total number of different anal sex partners showed no significant difference 
between groups at 1 year (p=0.57) but a larger proportion allocated to PrEP reported URAI (21% vs 12%; 
p=0.03, test for trend). 
As shown In Table 24, there was no difference in the occurrence of STIs, including rectal gonorrhoea and 
chlamydia, between groups, despite a suggestion of risk compensation among some PrEP recipients. The 
randomised comparison was biased by the greater number of screens for STIs in the PrEP group (mean 
4.2 vs 3.6), a consequence of more regular clinic attendance to collect prescriptions.

There were no serious adverse drug reactions. There were 28 AEs (most commonly nausea, headache and 
arthralgia) that resulted in interruption of PrEP.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The two main studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled. Testing for new HIV 
infections was conducted monthly and there was counselling provided on adherence and other preventive 
measures as well as testing for STIs and assessment of drug concentrations as an indicator of adherence. 
Safety monitoring included relevant laboratory testing as discussed under Safety. 
Both studies were powered to show at least 30% efficacy. The results of Partner’s PrEP met the 
pre-defined primary endpoint. The results of iPrEx did not meet the pre-defined primary endpoint but 
there were clearly fewer HIV-1 infections in the Truvada group and >30% efficacy was shown in 
secondary analyses in subsets. Both studies showed a strong association between adherence and 
protection. The CHMP considered information from the primary FDA review to further explore the studies.  
Efficacy in iPrEx 
In the mITT population up to the end of the double blind phase, with a median exposure of 77 weeks, 
subjects had been followed for 4237 person-years. The vast majority was enrolled in Peru. 
According to the primary efficacy analysis in the CSR Truvada was associated with a 44% lower incidence 
of HIV-1 acquisition compared with placebo in the mITT analysis set (95% CI 15% to 63%; p = 0.005) but 
the analysis did not exclude the null hypothesis of 30% efficacy or less. Results for the ITT analysis set 
were consistent 47% risk reduction (95% CI: 22% to 64%; p = 0.001). Similar findings applied to 
analyses based on end of treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment. However, the lower bound of the 95% 
CI for the relative risk exceeded 30% in those reporting URAI at screening. 
According to the FDA review, at the end of treatment, emergent HIV-1 seroconversion was observed in 
131 subjects, 48 in the Truvada group and 83 in the placebo group, indicating a 42% (95% CI: 18% to 
60%) reduction in risk. Risk reduction was higher (53%; 95% CI: 34% to 72%) in the 732 Truvada and 
753 placebo subjects who reported URAI within the last 12 weeks at screening. Hence, as acknowledged 
by FDA, their own review gave results very similar to those of the iPrEx team. 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 63/99 
 
  
  
 
Both the FDA and the CSR concluded that the reduction in the rate of HIV-1 acquisition was substantially 
impacted by study drug adherence. Among subjects for whom ≥ 90% study drug adherence was 
reported, the relative risk reduction for HIV-1 acquisition was 73% (95% CI: 41% to 88%; p < 0.001).  
The post hoc case control study of plasma and intracellular drug levels in about 10% of study subjects 
showed that risk reduction was greatest in subjects with detectable drug in plasma and intracellularly. 
The FDA figure shows the findings for intracellular TFV-DP as an example. 
Furthermore, the reduction in risk for HIV-1 infection was 92% (95% CI: 40% to 99%; p < 0.001) among 
Truvada subjects with quantifiable concentrations vs. those without quantifiable concentrations. The 
relative risk reduction after adjustment for URAI was 95% (95% CI: 70% to 99%; p < 0.001). The figure 
below shows efficacy by measurable intracellular TFV-DP.  
The FDA also looked at the relationship between plasma TFV and HIV-1 infection according to whether 
levels were above or below the median of 15.6 pmol/L. Results suggested that those with >median levels 
had the best protection but even levels that were < median but measurable were associated with better 
protection than placebo.

Furthermore, better adherence based on intracellular TFV-DP in some subgroups, which was associated 
with protection. 
However, the CSR states that there was no significant between-group difference in protection observed 
on the basis of region (important due to preponderance in Peru), race or ethnicity, male circumcision, 
level of education, alcohol use or age. Only a report of URAI at screening was associated with significant 
risk reduction.

As of 10 July 2011, the date at which the DSMB declared that the stopping rules for the study to had been 
met, 7830 person-years of follow-up time had accumulated in the 4747 eligible HIV-1 partner subjects.  
According to the CSR 99 site-reported seroconversion events were recorded during this period. Of these, 
3 were false positives and 14 were in partners who were PCR-positive at enrolment. Thus, 82 
seroconverting subjects were included in the mITT cohort, giving a sero-incidence rate of 1.05 per 100 
person-years (95% CI: 0.83–1.30). These 82 HIV-1 infections comprised 17 TDF, 13 Truvada and 52 
placebo patients, with corresponding incidence rates per 100 person-years of 0.65, 0.50 and 1.99. Thus, 
TDF and Truvada reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection by 67% (95% CI: 44%–81%; p = 0.0031) and 75% 
(95% CI: 55%–87%; p = 0.0004), respectively. These results met the underlying study premise of > 
30% efficacy. The degree of HIV-1 protection was comparable by gender and for most other subgroups.  
The test for homogeneity of treatment effects across subgroups achieved statistical significance only for 
the difference in the effect of TDF vs. placebo by CD4 level of the index subjects at enrolment.   
According to the FDA review there were 82 events (same numbers per group as in the CSR) in 7827 
person-years of follow up. It is also pointed out 2/13 seroconversion events in the Truvada arm and 3/52 
in the placebo arm occurred in women during treatment interruptions for pregnancy. The risk reduction 
rate agrees with that in the CSR. The FDA conducted additional sensitivity analyses taking into account 
initiation of ART in the index cases and treatment interruptions due to pregnancy or breastfeeding and 
found no impact on efficacy. The FDA analysis of efficacy by gender showed the following: 
The post hoc case control study of plasma drug levels in about 10% of study subjects (13 seroconverting 
subjects and 100 randomly selected uninfected subjects in the Truvada arm) showed that risk reduction 
was greatest in subjects with detectable plasma TFV. Efficacy was therefore strongly correlated with 
adherence.

EMA/561440/2016 
Page 66/99 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
There was no difference in HIV infection rate between placebo subjects and those with no measurable 
plasma TFV. 
Behavioural changes 
Rates of unprotected intercourse reported by study subjects appeared to decrease from baseline in both 
of the main studies over time, as shown in the figure below.  
In these two double blind studies there was no appreciable difference in risky behaviours between 
Truvada and placebo groups as measured by the STI rates.

The published OLE data support the core study report. After re-randomisation of a large proportion of 
subjects initially assigned to placebo the HIV-1 incidences in subjects receiving PrEP were similar before 
and after 10 July 2011. Overall, TFV was detected in a plasma sample obtained during the visit at which 
HIV-1 seroconversion was detected in 14 (27%) of 51 who acquired HIV-1 compared with 1047 (78%) of 
1334 samples from subjects who did not acquire HIV-1. Having detectable plasma TFV was associated 
with an estimated relative risk reduction for acquiring HIV-1 of 85% for TDF and 93% for Truvada. In 
most individuals, PrEP use was consistent during follow-up, with a slight decrease in use over time. 
Subjects who acquired HIV-1 generally seroconverted during PrEP non-use. 
Overall the core study and OLE showed trends favouring use of Truvada over TDF alone. Since TDF is the 
main driver of the safety profile of Truvada, there is no strong reason to select TDF alone when it could be 
associated with lesser protection. 
Supportive efficacy data 
CDC 4323 was primarily a safety study but it did demonstrate no HIV-1 infections in the Truvada group 
vs. 7 in the placebo group. 
CDC TDF2 provides data on high-risk heterosexuals, in whom Truvada had an overall protective efficacy 
of 62.2% (95% CI: 21.5%-83.4%; p = 0.013 vs. placebo [mITT]). In the as-treated population, where 
follow-up was censored at 30 days after the last reported dose of study drug, FTC/TDF had a protective 
efficacy of 77.9% (95% CI: 41.2%-93.6%; p < 0.001). The rather contrary findings for within-gender 
efficacy in the mITT and as-treated analyses need to be viewed with caution since the study was not 
powered to draw conclusions based on gender. This study again showed correlations between treatment 
adherence and protection against HIV-1 based on plasma TFV and FTC analyses.  
The results of PROUD, which evaluated daily Truvada, are also relevant to the current application. In 
contrast to iPrEx, PROUD was open-label in a deliberate attempt to assess efficacy in the setting in which 
PrEP would be introduced into a region/population in which PrEP was not a routine part of risk 
management in MSM. Up to the time when the steering committee recommended that all deferred 
participants should be offered PrEP there had been 3 infections in the immediate group (1.2/100 
person-years) vs. 20 in the deferred group (9.0/100 person-years). This difference was detected despite 
non-study prescriptions for PrEP in the deferred group. The relative risk reduction was 86% (90% CI 
64–96, p=0.0001). It was noted in this open-label study that a larger proportion allocated to PrEP 
reported URAI (21% vs 12%; p=0.03, test for trend) but there was no difference in the occurrence of 
STIs.  
It cannot be dismissed that there have been studies terminated early due to lack of efficacy for TDF or 
Truvada. In particular, two studies in women (FEM-PrEP and VOICE). It must also be noted that these 
studies were conducted in African women who may have had relatively low educational levels and that 
iPrEx showed an association of educational level and age with adherence as measured by drug levels and 
protection. Overall it seems to be a very consistent finding that if subjects actually take Truvada regularly 
they can be protected and that the higher the adherence the better the protection.

Finally, this application concerns daily Truvada use. The MAH has reviewed the published results from the 
Ipergay study but has not been given access to the data for independent evaluation. As a result, the MAH 
is unable to confirm the findings and an alternative posology cannot be recommended.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The available data from the two main studies support the efficacy of Truvada for HIV-1 PrEP usage. The 
better the adherence to daily treatment the better is the protection that is afforded. More information on 
very long-term adherence and behavioural changes are still required. A drug utilisation study is planned 
in the EU as described in the RMP.  Behavioural changes may or may not lead to an increased risk of HIV-1 
infection when adherence is high but it will lead to higher rates of other STIs, which is also highly 
undesirable especially in light of the current problems of resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to first-line and 
sometimes second line treatments. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This application dossier rests on data from studies that were not sponsored by the MAH. An integration of 
safety data across studies has not been provided and it is agreed that this would not be appropriate due 
to lack of consistency. However, the MAH has re-analysed some of the safety data in accordance with 
internal standard operating procedures such that the CSRs for the two main studies show tabulations 
derived from the MAH database. Safety data is described separately for the two main studies and for the 
CDC 4323 study for which the MAH provided a summary report.  
Safety in iPrEx - interim CSR 
Safety data presented in the interim CSR include events with onset through 01 May 2011. The focus is on 
analyses conducted using the MAH’s standard analysis methods. Through 01 May 2010, 1540 (62%) of 
the total subjects had received study drug for at least 1 year (772 [62%] FTC/TDF; 768 [62%] placebo). 
Table 25.  CO-US-104-0288: Summary of Exposure (Gilead Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
a Exposure is calculated as the number of weeks from the date of first bottle dispensed to the first occurrence between date of recorded study drug termination 
or positive HIV-1 test. If neither of these events occurred, the exposure is calculated as the number of weeks from the date of first bottle dispensed to the first 
occurrence between final study treatment suspension, last bottle dispensing, or study termination.

Table 26.  CO-US-104-0288: Overall Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Gilead 
Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
a Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs occurring on or after the first dose dispense date and on or before the last dose date + 30 days through 01 
May 2010; results for death comprise all reported events, including 1 event in the placebo group (Subject 9116736) who died > 30 days after the last dose 
of study drug. Two additional AEs with fatal outcomes (1 fatal event of hepatobiliary failure and 1 fatal motor vehicle accident in the FTC/TDF group) were 
reported in the database through 20 May 2010 with onset dates after the 01 May 2010 cutoff. 
Adverse events  
Using the MAH’s windows for AE analyses (TEAEs through 30 days post last dose), TEAEs occurred most 
commonly in Infections and Infestations (36% per group) and Gastrointestinal Disorders SOCs (13% 
FTC/TDF, 12% placebo). Three TEAEs were reported for ≥  5% subjects in either treatment group.

Subjects in Either Treatment Group (Gilead Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
a AEs are coded using MedDRA Version 10 Preferred Terms and SOC classifications. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs occurring on or after the 
first dose dispense date and on or before the last dose date + 30 days through 01 May 2010. 
Depression was the only MedDRA preferred terms with an absolute difference in incidence of ≥ 2% 
between treatment groups.

TEAEs that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 2% and with higher incidence in the FTC/TDF vs. placebo group 
were headache and syphilis (each 4% FTC/TDF, 3% placebo), abdominal pain and weight decreased 
(each 2% FTC/TDF, 1% placebo) and nausea (2% FTC/TDF, < 1% placebo). No differences in the overall 
safety profile of FTC/TDF vs. placebo were apparent by age, race or region. In both treatment groups the 
incidence of clinical AEs was higher among subjects aged ≥  40 years (n = 258; 66% FTC/TDF and 78% 
placebo) vs. younger subjects (n = 2241; 53% FTC/TDF and 54% placebo). 
Using the DAIDs grading, most clinical AEs were mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity. Grade 
3 or 4 TEAEs occurred in 9% (111 FTC/TDF, 112) but no PT exceeded 1% per group.  
The most common treatment-related AEs by PT were headache (14 FTC/TDF, 6 placebo), upper 
abdominal pain (9 vs. 8) and diarrhoea (10 vs. 4). Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs considered by the investigator to 
be related to study drug were reported for 3 FTC/TDF (attempted suicide, headache and tooth fracture) 
and 4 placebo (major depression, suicidal ideation, peripheral sensory neuropathy, arthralgia, and pain in 
extremity) subjects.  
No AEs of interest were predefined but rates of the commonest events in the SmPC are shown in Table 28. 
Table 28.  CO-US-104-0288: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Clinical AEs for Key Events Identified in 
the FTC/TDF Reference Safety Information (Gilead Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
a AEs are coded using MedDRA Version 10 Preferred Terms and SOC classifications. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs occurring on or after the 
first dose dispense date and on or before the last dose date + 30 days through 01 May 2010. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Nausea was more commonly reported on the monthly medical history questionnaires during the first 4 
weeks of study drug use in the FTC/TDF group (9% vs. 5% for placebo) and then decreased to 
comparable levels at subsequent visits.  
TEAEs in the Renal and Urinary Disorders MedDRA SOC were balanced between treatment groups (42 
[3%] vs. 50 [4%]) with no Grade 3 or 4 AEs in the FTC/TDF group and no treatment-emergent SAEs. 
Bone fractures occurred in 13 [1%] FTC/TDF and 9 [< 1%] placebo subjects. Bone fractures were 
generally reported to be traumatic and did not appear to be pathologic. A review of BMD results (hip and 
spine; see below for subset findings) showed no apparent correlation between BMD and the fracture 
events.  
Deaths 
Five subjects had fatal AEs (1 FTC/TDF and 4 placebo) but none was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug. The subject in the FTC/TDF group had a motor vehicle accident.  
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 71/99 
 
  
  
 
SAEs 
By MedDRA PT the most common SAEs were suicide attempt (10 FTC/TDF, 9 placebo), depression (2 vs. 
7) and suicidal ideation (2 vs. 5). SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were 
reported for 3 vs. 2 subjects. Serious laboratory toxicities were reported for 11 (< 1%) vs. 12 (< 1%). 
The rate of SAEs was higher in both treatment groups among subjects aged ≥ 40 years (11% vs. 5%) 
compared to those < 40 years (3% vs. 4%). 
Discontinuations due to AEs 
Laboratory toxicities leading to study drug discontinuation were reported for 3 FTC/TDF and 5 placebo 
subjects with no notable pattern for types of events or associated MedDRA SOCs. 
Laboratory findings 
No statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of abnormalities of key laboratory 
assessments of any toxicity grade. A higher incidence of mild-to-moderate elevations in serum creatinine 
was observed in the FTC/TDF group (25 [2%] vs. 14 [1%]) but no Grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine results 
were observed in the FTC/TDF group. Seven FTC/TDF and 3 placebo patients had a treatment interruption 
due to serum creatinine but 6/7 resumed FTC/TDF without further problems. 
The MAH’s severity grading scale for serum creatinine showed no Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities. No events 
of Fanconi syndrome were reported and no subjects had renal TEAEs leading to discontinuation.   
Other observations 
No patterns in vital sign changes or physical findings suggestive of a treatment-related effect were 
apparent with the exception of assessments of weight. The average weight increased at Week 12 in the 
placebo group, but not the FTC/TDF group (0.9% vs. 0%, p = 0.002), and then increased about 1.5% per 
year in both groups. Weight loss > 5%, intentional or unintentional, was recorded for 15% in each group.  
DEXA analyses of BMD 
There were 503 participants (247 FTC/TDF) in the optional BMD sub-study. Approximately half (48%) 
were between 18 and 24 years of age and thus considered likely to still be accruing bone mass. At 
baseline, 38% had low BMD (T-score < -1) in the spine and 16% had low BMD at the hip with no 
differences between groups. Mean BMD tended to increase in the placebo group and decrease in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016

FTC/TDF group, resulting in statistically significant differences (-0.4 to -1.0% across total hip, spine, 
femoral neck and trochanter) between the groups by Week 24.  
There was no difference between groups at any time point evaluated in the incidence of low BMD using 
World Health Organization (WHO) or International Society for Clinical Densitometry criteria. The subject 
incidence of total hip BMD T-score definitive of osteoporosis (< -2.5) at any time point was 0/202 vs. 
1/202 and the rate for osteopenia (1.0 to -2.5) was 39 (19%) vs. 34 (17%). 
Table 29.  CO-US-104-0288: Mean (Standard Error) Percentage Change in BMD (data from the iPrEx 
Study Team) (iPrEx Analysis; Subjects Who Participated in the DEXA Substudy) 
At least a 7% decrease from baseline in total hip BMD was observed in 6 subjects [3%] in each treatment 
group. Results were generally consistent for categorical analyses of the spinal BMD although numbers 
with a ≥ 5% decrease from baseline were higher (22/202 [11%] vs. 12/203 [6%]). Numbers with a 
“marked change” were 3/202 vs. 2/203. 
DEXA analyses of body fat 
In the 503 sub-study subjects the mean limb fat at baseline was comparable between treatment groups. 
Modest gains were observed in both treatment groups at 24-week assessments, with smaller gains in the 
FTC/TDF group through Week 48. These results were consistent with the assessments of trunk fat and 
total body fat.

Table 30.  CO-US-104-0288: Summary of Exposure (Gilead Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
Through the 21 November 2010 data cut-off, 950 (76%) FTC/TDF subjects had been exposed for at least 
1 year and 392 (31%) for at least 2 years.  
Using the MAH’s standard approach (window definitions) there were no major differences between 
treatment groups although the reporting rates did increase, including a 16% increase over the number of 
subjects reporting at least 1 clinical AE.  Similar findings applied when using the iPrEx team approach. 
Table 31.  CO-US-104-0288: Overall Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Gilead 
Analysis; Randomized Subjects) 
Using the MAH’s evaluation windows for AE analyses TEAEs occurred most commonly in SOCs of 
infections and infestations (55% FTC/TDF, 56% placebo), gastrointestinal disorders (20% vs. 19%) and 
psychiatric disorders (12% vs. 13%). By PT, 10 TEAEs were reported in ≥ 5% of subjects in either group.

TEAEs that occurred at a frequency ≥ 2% and with a higher frequency in the FTC/TDF group were syphilis 
and secondary syphilis (each 5% FTC/TDF vs. 4% placebo), abdominal pain (4% vs. 2%), tinea cruris and 
gastroenteritis (3% vs. 2%), weight decreased (3% vs. 1%) and fungal skin infection, cellulitis, 
gastrointestinal infection, tinea pedis, nausea, dyspepsia and insomnia (each 2% vs. 1%). By MedDRA PT 
all Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurred in < 1% in both treatment groups. No differences in the overall safety 
profile of FTC/TDF compared with placebo were apparent when TEAEs were evaluated by age, race or 
region. As before, the frequency of clinical AEs was higher among older subjects in both treatment 
groups.  
Headache (14 [1%] FTC/TDF, 10 [< 1%] placebo) was the only treatment-related AE reported in 1% of 
the FTC/TDF group. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug were 
reported for 3 in the FTC/TDF group and 4 in the placebo group. For the AEs that predominate in the 
Truvada SmPC, the frequency was low with small differences in the rates reported for nausea and weight 
decreased.

[6%] FTC/TDF vs. 64 [5%] placebo) and none was Grade 3 or 4 in the FTC/TDF group. 
Up to 01 May 2010 there had been 5 deaths (one FTC/TDF). However, as noted in the interim CSR, 
another two deaths (one FTC/TDF) occurred shortly after the cut-off date and were mentioned in the prior 
report. The additional FTC/TDF patient had experienced acute hepatic failure and died on 05 August 2010 
(Study Day 603) but study drug levels were <LLQ a year before the onset of acute hepatic failure. The 
cause of death was reported as upper digestive haemorrhage, associated with liver failure and 
angiocentric T cell lymphoma. The following liver function parameters increased ~2 to 8 fold from 29 April 
2010 (Study Day 504) to 22 July 2010 (Study Day 589; the last recorded values): alkaline phosphatase 
(107 to 188 IU/L), ALT (22 to 178 IU/L) and AST (29 to 167 IU/L). Death was considered unrelated to 
study drug by the investigator and probably not related to study drug by the DAIDS medical officer. The 
additional placebo patient had pulmonary TB. 
In the final report a further 2 deaths are reported, both in the placebo group, taking the total to 2 FTC/TDF 
and 7 placebo subjects. None was considered drug-related. 
Clinical SAEs were reported for 70 (6%) in the FTC/TDF group and 68 (5%) in the placebo group. 
Laboratory SAEs were reported for 19 (2%) and 18 (1%), respectively. By MedDRA PT SAEs were 
reported for ≤  1% per treatment group. The most common were suicide attempt (14 [1%] FTC/TDF, 12 
[< 1%] placebo, depression (6 vs. 11) and suicidal ideation (4 vs. 6). Clinical SAEs considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug occurred in one subject per group Suicide attempt in FTC/TDF 
subject). The rates of SAEs in those aged ≥ 40 years were 11% FTC/TDF vs. 6% placebo but the rates for 
those < 40 years were 5% in both groups. No pattern in the types of events among the older subjects was 
apparent.  
Nearly twice as many subjects had permanently discontinued study drug due to a clinical AE or laboratory 
AE at the time of the final CSR compared to the interim CSR data cut-off dates but rates remained similar 
between the treatment groups (3% due to clinical AEs and <1% due to laboratory AEs. By MedDRA PT all 
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported for < 1% per treatment group. Approximately 
half of the subjects (44/83) who discontinued study drug due to a clinical AE did so due to a psychiatric 
disorder, as required by the protocol (any suicidal ideation is regarded as Grade 4 according to the DAIDS 
grading table, and study drug had to be discontinued for Grade 4 AEs).  
Laboratory AEs are shown in Table 34. No statistically significant differences were observed in the 
frequency of abnormalities of laboratory assessments. A greater number of subjects in the FTC/TDF

treatment group had Grade 1 or Grade 2 elevations in serum creatinine but there were no higher Grade 
abnormalities.

FTC and TDF decrease HBV viral load. Subjects with total bilirubin, ALT or AST >2xULN or with clinical 
signs of cirrhosis were excluded from the study. The occurrence of hepatic flares (increase in AST or ALT 
to >5×ULN at any visit or an increase to >2.5×ULN for 3 months, within 24 weeks of permanently 
stopping study drug) in HBsAg+ subjects who discontinued study drug was assessed by post-treatment 
laboratory evaluations. The CSR reports these data up until September 2011. There were only 16 HBsAg+ 
subjects, of which 12 had chronic infection (6 in each group) and 4 had acute infection (2 in each group). 
None was infected with HCV. None of these subjects experienced a hepatic flare after stopping study 
drug. 
Assessment of BMD via DEXA showed that a total hip BMD T-score definitive of osteoporosis at any 
post-baseline on-study drug time point occurred in 0/211 FTC/TDF and 2/214 placebo subjects while 
osteopenia was described for 41/211 (19%) and 38/214 (18%), respectively. One FTC/TDF subject had 
at least a 7% decrease from baseline in total hip BMD. Results were generally consistent for categorical 
analyses of the spinal BMD although the numbers with a ≥ 5% decrease from baseline at any 
post-baseline on-study drug time point were higher (30/214 [14%]) for the FTC/TDF vs. placebo group 
(14/216 [6%]). Despite this, marked changes occurred in 7/214 subjects [3%] vs. 4/216 subjects [2%]. 
Statistically significant mean (SE) percent decreases from baseline in total hip BMD were noted in the 
FTC/TDF group compared with the placebo group at last post-stop scan and at all post-stop scans. No 
other statistically significant mean (SE) percent changes from baseline or stop-study drug scans to 
post-stop scans in BMD were noted during the study. In the interval between the last on-study-drug BMD 
evaluation and the last post-stop BMD evaluation the mean BMD for total hip and spine increased in the 
FTC/TDF group but remained stable in the placebo group.

Modest gains in limb fat were observed in both treatment groups through the study, at each of the 
24-week on-drug assessments, with smaller gains observed in the FTC/TDF group compared with placebo 
through Week 72. Although the number of subjects with assessments was smaller at the Week 96 visit, 
the mean increases in limb fat were similar between both treatment groups at that time point.  Likewise, 
mean increases in limb fat were similar between both treatment groups when measured from the last 
dose of study drug to the Week 24 Post-Stop Drug assessment.

a Percentage based on the number of partner subjects. 
b Percentage based on the number of serious adverse events. 
c Assessments of treatment-relatedness were performed by the investigators. The coordinating center’s safety monitor assessed all serious adverse events, 
on behalf of the study sponsor, with the exception of 2 events in the placebo group, as probably not related or not related. The 2 events that were assessed 
as possibly related by the site investigators and the safety monitor were both Grade 4 increases in ALT and AST, unaccompanied by clinical symptoms/signs. 
In both cases, the Grade 4 measurement did not confirm on repeat testing, performed within 7 days of the initial measurement; both repeat counts were within 
normal limits. Study medication was briefly withheld and then resumed in both cases. A subsequent Grade 3 or 4 adverse event did not occur in relation to 
these laboratory assessments 
The only individual events reported by ≥10% in the TDF group were neutrophil count decreased (38%), 
blood phosphorous decreased (28%), malaria (19%), haemoglobin decreased (16%) and platelet count 
decreased (12%). These same events were reported by generally similar percentages in the FTC/TDF and 
placebo groups but a slightly greater percentage in the FTC/TDF group had decreases in neutrophil count 
(44% vs. 37%–38%). URTI was reported in 10% in the FTC/TDF group and 8% to 9% in the other study 
drug groups. Non-serious AEs were not assessed for severity.

Table 38.  CO-US-104-0380: Adverse Events Reported for at Least 3% of the Partner Subjects in Any 
Treatment Group (ITT) 
For the AESIs, 269 subjects (5-7% per group) had AEs associated with increases in blood creatinine levels 
of which none was serious but in 1% per group these were EAEs. Of all reported increases in blood 
creatinine only 19, 20 and 13 per group were confirmed on repeat testing, none was Grade 4 and nearly 
all were Grade 1 (50% increase over baseline but WNL). Decreases in blood phosphorous levels were 
experienced in 28-30% per group and 6-7% had EAEs. One in the FTC/TDF group was serious but it 
resolved and did not result in a change in study drug administration. None of the confirmed events were 
Grade 4, and most were Grade 2. 
Of the 34 (0.7%) bone fractures (all EAEs; 12, 9 and 13 per group) 10 were serious but were considered 
not related to study drug and were due to trauma. Diarrhoea was reported infrequently in 2%–3% per 
group. A decrease in weight was reported as an AE for 9, 4 and 6 per group with EAEs in 6 TDF subjects 
and in 1 in each of the other groups. The most common EAEs are shown below.

Table 39.  CO-US-104-0380: Expedited Adverse Events Reported for at Least 1% of the Partner Subjects 
in Any Treatment Group (ITT) 
In the TDF, FTC/TDF, and placebo groups, 8, 8, and 9 partner subjects, respectively, died during the 
study. There were no clear trends of concern. 
Most SAEs were associated with abnormal clinical laboratory findings, especially decreased neutrophils or 
Hb and increased transaminases. There was no clear trend by treatment group. 
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in only 6 subjects and all were due to increases in blood creatinine 
that were confirmed on repeat testing. All except one Grade 1 increase were of Grade 2 and none was 
considered related to the study drug by the safety monitor. These Grade 2 increases were associated with 
estimated CrCL drops to <50 mL/min, in most cases from a baseline of just greater than 50 mL/min. 
Abnormal laboratory results were repeated on a different sample for confirmation. In the vast majority of 
cases, confirmatory testing was of lower grade or normal. The following is based on any rather than 
confirmed abnormalities. 
Using the MAH’s definitions, nearly all abnormal creatinine or phosphorous results were Grade 1.

Table 40.  CO-US-104-0380: Post-baseline Creatinine and Phosphorus Laboratory Toxicities (ITT) 
Other clinical laboratory toxicities concerned abnormal ANC count (15.3%), Hb (5.6%), platelet count 
(3.6%), AST (2.0%) and ALT (1.4%). Toxicities associated with neutrophils were seen more commonly in 
the FTC/TDF group (17.8% and 3.9% Grade 3 or 4) than in the TDF group (15.0%; 2.6% Grade 3 or 4) 
or placebo group (13.2%; 1.8% Grade 3 or 4). No other noteworthy differences were observed between 
study groups. 
Pregnancy occurred in 18%, 13% and 14% in the TDF, FTC/TDF and placebo groups, respectively. Of 
these 288 pregnancies, 178 have completed with 90 live births. The pregnancy loss rate across all 
completed pregnancies was lower in TDF group (40% vs. 57% FTC/TDF and 54% placebo). Spontaneous 
abortions occurred almost entirely at < 20 weeks. Five of the 90 live births died within 1 to 3 months of 
birth.  Medical abortion is not legal in either Kenya or Uganda and women terminating unwanted 
pregnancies may instead report spontaneous abortion/miscarriage. 
Safety in CDC 4323 (CO-US-104-0277) 
A total of 2,428 TEAEs were reported by 334 (90%) participants of which 76% were Grade 1/mild and 
21% were Grade 2/moderate. There were 62 Grade 3 or 4 AEs in 37 subjects. The pre-defined AESIs are 
shown in Table 41.

Table 41.  Adverse events of interest: frequencies and rates per 100 person-years 
In multivariate analyses, back pain was noted to be significantly associated with receipt of TDF. Review of 
study records of participants reporting back pain revealed no recorded fractures. Those with back pain did 
not show an association with markers as shown below (but BMD was only assessed in a subset; see 
below). 
There were 9 TDF and 5 placebo subjects with fractures, of which 4 and 2 involved the foot. The others 
were at scattered sites.  
No grade 3 or 4 creatinine elevations were recorded while grade 1 and 2 elevations were uncommon, and 
occurred with similar frequency in the TDF and placebo groups (Grade 1 - 1 TDF vs. 4 placebo; Grade 2 
– 1 vs. 2. Confirmed elevated creatinine values ≥0.5 mg/dL over baseline occurred in two placebo 
subjects. Mild to moderate hypophosphatemia was relatively common and occurred with similar rates in 
TDF vs. placebo arms. Grade 3 hypophosphatemia occurred in 4 TDF vs. 1 placebo subject and grade 4 
was reported in one placebo subject. 
There were 29 SAEs reported by 10 TDF and 8 placebo subjects, of which the most common was 
depression (4 vs. 2). One TDF subject had pulmonary oedema, appendicitis, prostate cancer, coronary 
artery disease, hypercholesterolaemia, mania, poisoning, seroma and spinal fracture. One SAE resulted 
in death in a TDF subject secondary to combined opiate and alcohol intoxication. 
In the SFO subset, low BMD (Z score ≤-2.0) was observed more frequently than expected in this MSM 
population with median age 41 years. Significant baseline correlates were amphetamine use (OR 5.9), 
inhalants (OR 4.6) and MVI/calcium/Vitamin D use (OR -0.26). Two with low baseline BMD had vitamin D

deficiency and one had hypogonadism. TDF was associated with small but statistically significant 
decreases in BMD at the femoral neck (1.1% decrease) and total hip (0.8% decrease).  
Overall bone fractures at any site were not significantly associated with receipt of TDF but the power to 
detect differences in fracture rates is limited by the sample size. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Truvada when used for PrEP was entirely as expected based on the wealth of 
experience with this combination within complete ART regimens. The CHMP considered information from 
the FDA safety review. 
With regard to the known renal effects of TFV it should be noted that the study populations generally 
anticipated to use PrEP are likely to have low rates of factors that have been associated with renal 
abnormalities during TDF treatment (including higher age, lower CrCL, underlying diabetes and 
concomitant nephrotoxic agents). The FDA’s table summarises the effects on creatinine and phosphorus. 
The data are shown below for categorical changes in serum creatinine. Essentially there were no major 
differences between active and placebo groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 85/99 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
This finding also applied to urinalysis findings (FDA summary table).  
As described above for CDC 4323, there was a trend to greater decreases in BMD in subjects who received 
TDF in this study. When data were examined for those with ≥ or < 20% increases in serum creatinine 
from baseline, associations were apparent with effects on BMD and ALP.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Truvada for PrEP can be expected to be similar to that already very well recognised 
when it is used for treatment of HIV-1. The difference is therefore not in the safety profile per se when 
Truvada is used for treatment vs. prophylaxis but in the benefit-risk relationship when Truvada is given to 
subjects who are not yet infected and in whom HIV-1 infection could be wholly prevented if appropriate 
non-pharmacological measures were to be adequately and consistently employed.  
The main point is that PrEP is used entirely because human behaviour is fallible. Ultimately, since it has 
been concluded that Truvada works if it is taken, it is for subjects and their physicians to discuss to what 
extent it is acknowledged that adequate preventive measures will not always be applied and to weigh up 
the benefit of the additional protection that may be afforded by daily oral prophylaxis against the risks of 
renal and bone effects as well as the lesser and more minor side effects that can occur. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 12 is acceptable. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 12 with the following content:

discontinuation of Truvada. 
None 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC and the Truvada Package Leaflet

prevention strategy and that the individual should be counselled to 
strictly adhere to the recommended Truvada dosing schedule. 
Development of 
resistance in patients 
with unrecognized or 
acute HIV-1 infection 
(TVD – PrEP) 
Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC and the Truvada Package 
Leaflet warn that Truvada should only be used in individuals 
confirmed to be HIV-negative prior to initiating and routinely while 
taking Truvada for PrEP. 
Renal toxicity (TDF) 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada should only be 
used in individuals with creatinine clearance below 80 mL/min if the 
potential benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the 
potential risks. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC provides guidance on calculating 
creatinine clearance at baseline and the regular monitoring of renal 
function during Truvada use. In individuals at risk for renal 
impairment, more frequent monitoring of renal function is required. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that use of Truvada should 
be avoided with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal 
products and that if concomitant use of Truvada and nephrotoxic 
agents is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that cases of acute renal 
failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been 
reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with TDF and with risk 
factors for renal dysfunction. If Truvada is coadministered with an 
NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that the potential risks and 
benefits associated with coadministration of LDV/SOF with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease 
inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be considered, 
particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction, and that 
patients receiving LDV/SOF concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored 
for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Section 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC provides guidance that 
coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with LDV/SOF and 
atazanavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir should be used with 
caution with frequent renal monitoring if other alternatives are not 
available, and that when LDV/SOF is coadministered with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz or rilpivirine no dose adjustment is 
recommended but renal function should be closely monitored. 
Section 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC provides information on 
interactions due to elimination of FTC and TDF by the kidneys and 
provides recommendations against the use of Truvada with 
nephrotoxic medications. 
Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC recommends that renal function 
should be monitored in any individual receiving Truvada as Truvada 
may cause renal damage.

Minimization 
Measures 
Renal ADRs associated with the TDF component of Truvada are 
provided in Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC. 
Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC states that proximal renal 
tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate discontinuation. Individuals at risk of renal impairment 
(such as individuals with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV 
disease, or individuals receiving concomitant nephrotoxic 
medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete 
recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
discontinuation. 
For treatment of HIV-1 infection: 
Section 4.2 of the Truvada SmPC also contains recommendations on 
dosing in mild renal impairment (Clcr 50-80 mL/min) and moderate 
renal impairment (Clcr 30-49 mL/min) and states that Truvada is not 
recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <30 mL/min) and patients who require hemodialysis. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that a higher risk of renal 
impairment has been reported in patients receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat 
boosted protease inhibitor. A close monitoring of renal function is 
required in these patients. In patients with renal risk factors, the 
coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with a boosted 
protease inhibitor should be carefully evaluated. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a warning statement that 
renal function should be re-evaluated within a week should serum 
phosphate decrease < 1.5 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance decrease 
to < 50 mL/min in any patient receiving Truvada. Consideration 
should be given to interrupting treatment with Truvada in patients 
with creatinine clearance < 50mL/min or decreases in serum 
phosphate to <1.0mg/dL (0.32mmol/L). Interrupting treatment with 
Truvada should also be considered in case of progressive decline of 
renal function when no other cause has been identified. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a recommendation that 
dose interval adjustments for HIV-1 patients with creatinine 
clearance 30-49 mL/min should be made. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a warning that a careful 
benefit-risk assessment is needed when Truvada is used in patients 
with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and that renal function should 
be closely monitored. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC contains a warning that the clinical 
response to treatment should be closely monitored in patients 
receiving Truvada at a prolonged dosing interval. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada is not 
recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min) or on dialysis as the appropriate dose dose 
adjustments cannot be achieved with the combination tablet. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada is not 
recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min) or on dialysis as the appropriate dose  
adjustments cannot be achieved with the combination tablet. 
For PrEP: 
Section 4.2 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC states that Truvada has not 
been studied in HIV-1 uninfected individuals with creatinine 
clearance < 60 mL/min and is therefore not recommended for use in 
this population. 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC also contains a warning statement 
that renal function should be re-evaluated within a week should 
serum phosphate decrease < 1.5 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance 
decrease to < 60 mL/min in any individual receiving Truvada. 
Consideration should be given to interrupting use of Truvada in

BMD (TDF) 
Section 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC warns about loss of BMD associated 
with TDF and that more pronounced decreases in BMD were seen in 
patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of a 
regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor and provides 
guidance that alternative treatment regimens should be considered 
for patients with osteoporosis that are at a high risk for fractures.

Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC warn that 
coadministration of tenofovir DF and didanosine is not recommended 
and there is a statement in Section 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC 
regarding the risk of lactic acidosis and pancreatitis associated with 
the interaction between TDF and didanosine. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Truvada SmPC warn about the risk of 
pancreatitis associated with the interaction between TDF and 
didanosine and state that co-administration is not recommended. 
Pancreatitis is included as an ADR to TDF in Section 4.8 of the 
Truvada SmPC. 
Missing Information 
Safety in children 
(including long-term 
safety (TDF) 
Sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the Truvada SmPC note that the safety and 
efficacy of Truvada has not yet been studied in children < 18 years 
old and therefore Truvada is not recommended in this population. 
Safety in elderly 
patients (FTC, TDF) 
Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the Truvada SmPC note that Truvada has not 
been studied in individuals over the age of 65 years, and should be 
administered with caution in this patient population. 
Safety in pregnancy 
(FTC, TDF) 
Section 4.6 of the Truvada SmPC provides information on pregnancy 
in humans for the FTC and TDF components and in animals for all 
components of Truvada and notes that Truvada may be considered 
during pregnancy, if necessary.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The current application to add an indication for use of daily Truvada for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP) is principally based on CO-US-104-0288 (iPrEx), which was conducted in MSM. This was an 
event-driven study such that by the cut-off date for the primary analysis 1540/2499 (62%) of subjects 
had been on study for ≥ 1 year. 
The study reported relative effectiveness of 44% (mITT) and 47% (ITT) in the primary analysis. The lower 
bounds of the 95% CI were above zero but below the pre-defined cut-off of 30%. Results for EOT and 8 
weeks post-EOT gave very similar results to those for the primary analysis. However, in mITT subjects 
reporting ≥90% pill adherence the relative efficacy was 73% (41%, 88%) and for those with quantifiable 
plasma or intracellular drug levels the relative efficacy was 92% (40%, 99%), even in those reporting 
URAI. Thus, as in previous studies, efficacy of oral Truvada depended on adherence. Adherence and 
efficacy were related to age, level of education and reporting URAI at screening. 
The number of sexual partners with whom respondents had receptive anal intercourse decreased after 
study enrolment, and the percentage of those partners who used a condom increased with similar results 
in each treatment group at each time point. No significant between-group differences were found in the 
incidence of syphilis (p = 0.49), gonorrhoea (p = 0.74), chlamydia (p = 0.43), genital warts (p = 0.53) or 
genital ulcers (p = 0.62) during follow-up. 
A second study (CO-US-104-0380; Partner’s PrEP) provides efficacy data in HIV-1 discordant couples. At 
the time the study was conducted and at the locations involved the index cases were not to be considered 
in need of HIV treatment. In reality, most if not all of them would now be given ART if resident in the EU. 
With 4758 couples involved, there were 7830 person-years and median 23 months of follow-up for 
assessment of HIV-1 incidence.  
In the mITT population the HRs for TDF relative to placebo indicated a 67% reduction (95% CI: 
44%–81%) in risk of HIV-1 acquisition while the HRs for FTC/TDF relative to placebo indicated a 75% 
reduction (95% CI: 55%–87%) in risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Overall, similar protective trends for TDF and 
FTC/TDF compared with placebo were observed in each sub-group including gender. Using a case-cohort 
analysis, detection of tenofovir in plasma samples was compared for partners who received active therapy 
and did or did not acquire HIV-1. Cases were much less likely than controls to have detectable TFV in 
plasma (actual concentrations were not determined).  
Percentages of HIV-1 seronegative partners who reported having sex without condoms with their HIV-1 
infected partner during the prior month decreased from 27% at baseline to 13% and 9% at 12 and 24 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 93/99 
 
  
  
months, respectively. In contrast, the percentages who reported having sex with an outside partner for 
any prior month increased from 9% at baseline to 30% during the study.  
Both these studies had extensions, which have been reported in the literature. Participants in iPrEx were 
offered open label Truvada. The HIV incidence on PrEP was 53% (95% CI 26 to 70) lower than in the 
placebo group of the randomised phase (3.93 infections per 100 p-y) and 51% (95% CI 23 to 69) lower 
than during the gap between the randomised phase and the OLE (3.81 infections per 100 p-y). HIV 
incidence was strongly inversely related to detection of TFV-DP in dried blood spots. 
Participants in Partner’s PrEP who had been assigned to placebo were offered re-randomisation (in a 1:1 
ratio) to TDF or Truvada in a blinded fashion. All subjects continuing on treatment regardless of the initial 
randomisation group were kept unaware of the exact treatment they received until 30 Dec 2012. The 
cumulative data include an additional 3569 p-y of follow-up and 26 additional HIV-1 infections. Of the 
additional 26 (17 TDF and 9 Truvada) infections 12 (8 TDF; 4 Truvada) had been infected at the time of 
initial randomisation (8) or re-randomisation (4). Thus, 52 infections occurred after randomisation in 
subjects on active treatment, including 31 in the TDF arm (0.71 per 100 p-y) and 21 in the Truvada arm 
(0.48 per 100 p-y); not significant (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39–1.17; p=0.16). Having detectable plasma TFV 
was associated with an estimated relative risk reduction for acquiring HIV-1 of 85% for TDF and 93% for 
Truvada. HIV-1 incidences in subjects receiving PrEP were similar before and after the DSMB intervened 
to stop the placebo group, in which HIV-1 incidence was 2 per 100 p-y.  
Other supportive data come from CDC TDF2 in heterosexual men and women and CDC 4323 in MSM only. 
CDC TDF2 compared Truvada with placebo and reported HIV seroconversion in 9 Truvada and 24 placebo 
group subjects. These numbers gave an overall protective efficacy of 62.2% (95% CI: 21.5%-83.4%; p 
= 0.013 [mITT]). In the as-treated population FTC/TDF had a protective efficacy of 77.9% (95% CI: 
41.2%-93.6%; p < 0.001). Among participants randomised to Truvada, TFV was detected in the plasma 
of 50% of seroconverting subjects at the seroconversion visit and in 79.7% of uninfected controls at 
similar time points. Similarly, FTC was detected in 50% and 81.2% of seroconverting subjects and 
uninfected subjects, respectively. CDC 4323 was not powered for efficacy but it demonstrated no HIV-1 
infections in the daily TDF group vs. 6 infections in subjects randomised to the placebo group. 
More recently, data were reported from the pilot phase of PROUD in MSM. At the time when the steering 
committee recommended that all deferred participants should be offered PrEP follow-up for HIV incidence 
was complete for 243 (94%) of 259 patient-years in the immediate daily Truvada group versus 222 
(90%) of 245 patient-years in the deferred group. Three HIV infections had occurred in the immediate 
group (1.2/100 person-years) vs. 20 in the deferred group (9.0/100 person-years) despite 174 non-study 
prescriptions for PrEP in the deferred group (leaving 167 without prior use of PrEP). These results give a 
relative reduction of 86% (90% CI 64–96, p=0·0001) and an absolute difference of 7.8/100 person-years 
(90% CI 4.3–11.3). In this open-label study the total number of different anal sex partners showed no 
significant difference between groups at 1 year (p=0.57) but a larger proportion allocated to PrEP 
reported URAI (21% vs 12%; p=0.03, test for trend). There was no difference in the occurrence of STIs, 
including rectal gonorrhoea and chlamydia, between groups.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are two issues that are expected to impact on the benefit of once daily Truvada in routine use over 
longer periods than have been studied within formal clinical trial settings.  
The first is the potential for dwindling adherence to daily dosing, which has already been shown very 
clearly to impact on efficacy. The second is that taking an oral PrEP will prompt at least some individuals 
to engage in more risky behaviours, which could result in a higher rate of seroconversion despite PrEP 
compared to the trial settings, especially if also accompanied by dwindling adherence. In iPrEx and 
Assessment report  
EMA/561440/2016 
Page 94/99 
 
  
  
Partner’s PrEP the assessment of behavioural change suggested that being on a study without knowledge 
of treatment assignment actually reduced risky behaviours to some extent from screening visit reports.  
The most relevant investigation of these risks within a clinical trial setting was in the open label PROUD 
study. However, in this study that was specifically intended to mimic routine use, a proportion of subjects 
in the delayed group acquired access to PrEP anyway. Therefore it is difficult to interpret the overall 
findings but, despite some access to PrEP in the delayed group, a larger proportion allocated to PrEP 
reported URAI (21% vs 12%; p=0.03, test for trend). On the other hand, several studies found that those 
engaging in URAI were more likely to be adherent and derived high levels of protection despite this 
behaviour.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Truvada is very well known. When used for PrEP in HIV-1 uninfected subjects the 
safety profile was entirely as expected based on the wealth of experience with this combination within 
complete ART regimens.  
With regard to the known renal effects of TFV it should be noted that the study populations generally 
anticipated to use PrEP are likely to have low rates of factors that have been associated with renal 
abnormalities during TDF treatment (including higher age, lower CrCL, underlying diabetes and 
concomitant nephrotoxic agents). This may explain why there were not major differences in renal 
markers between active and placebo groups in the two main PrEP studies reported in this application. 
There was a consistent trend to greater decreases in BMD vs. placebo in subjects who received TDF or 
Truvada for PrEP. These observations are described in the SmPC and adequately reflected in the RMP. 
There is no reason to think that subjects taking TDF as part of PrEP are at any different risk to those taking 
it for treatment.  
Another important risk not directly related to safety is that subjects could acquire HIV-1 despite PrEP and 
continue to expose the virus to Truvada until such time as the infection is discovered and a full ART 
regimen is commenced as necessary. This raises the risk of development of clinically important 
resistance. Thus far it appears that the risk is likely low but it is adequately addressed in the SmPC and PL 
so that subjects prescribed PrEP are tested for HIV-1 acquisition at frequent intervals. There is an 
additional risk that this could occur in persons who have an acute HIV-1 infection when initially prescribed 
PrEP with negative laboratory tests. Thus the SmPC includes a warning against starting PrEP if there is any 
clinical suspicion of acute infection at the time. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
With long term PrEP use the safety profile can be expected to resemble that already documented for use 
of Truvada within treatment regimens. The risk of selecting for resistance as described above cannot be 
predicted at this time.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Truvada has been shown to provide some degree of protection against HIV-1 infection in persons who put 
themselves  at  risk.  The  degree of  protection  has  been  repeatedly  shown  to be  related to the  level  of 
adherence,  supported  by  finding  drug  in  plasma  and/or  intracellularly,  although  the  minimum 
concentrations that are needed to provide protection have not been identified. Thus, if taken regularly, 
Truvada can be regarded as having benefit in persons unwilling or unable to take adequate behavioural 
steps to prevent infection.  
The safety profile of Truvada for PrEP can be expected to be similar to that already very well recognised 
when it is used for treatment of HIV-1.  
The  difference  in  the  benefit  risk  relationship  when  Truvada  is  used  for  treatment  vs.  prophylaxis  is 
therefore not in the safety profile per se but in the benefit that may be expected when Truvada is given 
to subjects who are not yet infected and in whom HIV-1 infection could be wholly prevented if appropriate 
non-pharmacological measures were to be adequately and consistently employed.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Ultimately, since it has been concluded that Truvada works if it is taken, it is for subjects and their 
physicians to discuss to what extent it is acknowledged that adequate preventive measures will not 
always be applied and to weigh up the benefit of the additional protection that may be afforded by daily 
oral prophylaxis against the risks of renal and bone effects as well as the lesser and more minor side 
effects that can occur.

Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit-risk balance is favourable provided that PrEP use is considered by experienced physicians to 
be appropriate for individual patients and provided that monitoring of the individual for HIV-1 infection 
and ADRs of TDF is adequate.

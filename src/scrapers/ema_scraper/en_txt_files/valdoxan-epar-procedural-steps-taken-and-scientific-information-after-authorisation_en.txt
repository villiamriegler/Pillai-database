Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II, Labelling 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Thymanax 
remains positive, but that there are outstanding safety 
concerns with agomelatine THYMANAX in the treatment of 
major depressive episodes which require an additional five 
year renewal on the basis of the following 
Page 7/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacovigilance grounds: 
• 
Uncertainty concerning the risk of liver toxicity and 
the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures 
introduced which are as follows: 
The observed reactions of serious liver toxicity indicated a 
lack of compliance with treatment recommendations. 
Consequently, updated treatment recommendations, a 
DHPC and updated educational materials had been 
distributed to potential prescribers to inform of the risk of 
liver toxicity and remind prescribers of the necessity to 
comply with the treatment recommendations. Due to the 
short period of time since these risk minimisation measures 
were set out in practice, the effectiveness of these 
measures could not be properly evaluated.   
• 
Uncertainty regarding the potential association 
between agomelatine and QT prolongation (on-going signal 
evaluation on potential effect on the heart).

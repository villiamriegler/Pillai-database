Brief description of the product
Chemical class: CMV viral DNA terminase complex inhibitor
Hyperlink to the Prescribing
Information
Indication(s) in the EEA
Summary of mode of action: Letermovir inhibits the CMV DNA terminase 
complex, which is required for viral DNA replication
Important information about its composition: Letermovir Concentrate for 
solution for infusion contains hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (also called 
hydroxypropylbetadex)
The current version of the Prescribing Information (PI) was approved on 4-Jan-
2022 via procedure EMEA/H/C/004536/ R/0027 and is available at the 
following hyperlink: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-
information/prevymis-epar-product-information_en.pdf
Current: PREVYMIS is indicated for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
reactivation and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an 
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
Proposed: 
PREVYMIS is indicated for prophylaxis of CMV disease in CMV-seronegative 
adults who have received a kidney transplant from a CMV-seropositive donor 
[D+/R-].
 
 
Table I.1:
Product Overview
Dosage in the EEA
Current:
PREVYMIS is available as oral tablets and concentrate for solution for infusion 
(240mg and 480mg).
PREVYMIS tablets and concentrate for solution for infusion may be used 
interchangeably at the discretion of the physician, and no dose adjustment is 
necessary.
The recommended dosage of PREVYMIS is 480mg once daily.
PREVYMIS should be started after HSCT. PREVYMIS may be started on the 
day of transplant and no later than 28 days post-transplant. PREVYMIS may be 
started before or after engraftment. Prophylaxis with PREVYMIS should 
continue through 100 days post-transplant.
The safety and efficacy of letermovir use for more than 100 days has not been 
studied in clinical trials. Prolonged letermovir prophylaxis beyond 100 days post-
transplant may be of benefit in some patients at high risk for late CMV 
reactivation (see section 5.1). Use of letermovir prophylaxis for greater than 100 
days requires a careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance.
Dosage adjustment
• If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of 
PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily (see sections 4.5 and 
5.2). 
• If cyclosporine is initiated after starting PREVYMIS, the next dose of 
PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily. 
• If cyclosporine is discontinued after starting PREVYMIS, the next dose of 
PREVYMIS should be increased to 480 mg once daily. 
• If cyclosporine dosing is temporarily interrupted due to high cyclosporine 
levels, no dose adjustment of PREVYMIS is needed. 
Proposed:
HSCT (revision to use post 100 days is proposed as follow):
Prolonged PREVYMIS prophylaxis beyond 100 days post-HSCT may be of 
benefit in some patients at high risk for late CMV reactivation (see section 
5.1). The safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS use for more than 200 days has not 
been studied in clinical trials.
Kidney Transplant (addition of subsection on dosing in kidney transplant patients 
is proposed):
PREVYMIS should be started on the day of transplant and no later than 7 days 
post-kidney transplant and continued through 200 days post-transplant.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
Indication: PREVYMIS is indicated for the prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
Incidence: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is ubiquitous and generally acquired early in life, with 
the majority of the adult population being CMV-seropositive in most countries worldwide.  
Allogeneic HSCT recipients are immune-compromised, which increases the risk for CMV 
infection (as measured by CMV viremia), mostly due to reactivation of latent CMV 
infection. PREVYMIS prophylaxis in the first 100 days post-HSCT has been shown to be 
effective in preventing CMV infection and disease following HSCT [Ref. 5.4: 085RKS]. 
However, after completion of prophylaxis with PREVYMIS, clinically significant late CMV 
infection (i.e., CMV infection and or disease occurring beyond day 100 post-transplantation) 
can occur in some patients.
Among allogeneic HSCT recipients who are CMV seropositive (R+), 80% of recipients 
develop CMV reactivation, and 20% to 35% of this population progress to CMV disease in 
the absence of preventive measures [Ref. 5.4: 03RRN9]. The highest risk period for 
developing CMV infection (as defined by detectable CMV DNA) is during the first 100 days 
post-transplant [Ref. 5.4: 03RTB5].
Prevalence: In 2019, the median HSCT rate (TR) per 10 million in Europe was 144 
[Ref. 5.4: 07YS3Z]). According to available studies, adult HSCT recipients who have 
evidence of prior CMV infection (R+) are at risk for CMV reactivation and disease post-
HSCT [Ref. 5.4: 03RRN9, 04HYZL, 04HYZR, 04J8SK]. In the review of three studies from 
the USA and Sweden, [Ref. 5.4: 07YS42] a CMV seropositive rate of 55.9% (2114/3780) 
was reported in all-HSCT; 13% of the seropositive patients developed CMV disease versus 
1.7% of CMV seronegative recipients. Thus, the CMV-seropositive recipients had ninefold 
higher odds of CMV disease than the CMV-seronegative recipients (OR 9.12, 95% CI 6.19–
13.43, p < 0.0001). 
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication and risk factors for the 
disease: 
From 2006 to 2012, approximately 400,000 allogeneic HSCTs were reported by 1,516 
transplant centers in 75 countries [Ref. 5.4: 04J8SG], including approximately 10,000 
subjects in the U.S. The numbers from the US remain the same annually for more recent 
years (2013-2019) [Ref. 5.4: 05N82D]. In Europe, 19,800 allogeneic HSCTs were performed 
in 30 European and 11 non-European countries in 2019 [Ref. 5.4: 07YS3Z]. From 2006 to 
2012, in Southeast Asia and Western Pacific region, there were (on average) approximately 
6,400 allogeneic HSCTs performed annually [Ref. 5.4: 04J8SG]. According to one large 
retrospective study of over 28,000 HSCTs, patients were on average 43 years old 
(interquartile range: 31 to 53 years) and were more often male (55% male vs 45% female) 
 
 
[Ref. 5.4: 04L9MF]. There is no evidence demonstrating regional or gender differences in 
CMV infection or disease among HSCT patients.
The main existing treatment options: 
There are currently two approaches to preventing CMV infection or disease in HSCT 
recipients: 
1) Prophylaxis with PREVYMIS, and 2) pre-emptive therapy (PET), which refers to the 
practice of active surveillance for viral replication and initiating treatment with anti-CMV 
agents when CMV viremia is detected [Ref. 5.4: 03RT9X]. 
Prior to PREVYMIS, all available anti-CMV agents, whether used for prophylaxis or PET, 
are nucleoside analogues which have toxicities, including myelosuppression and 
nephrotoxicity, that limit their clinical utility.  The most widely used agents, ganciclovir 
(GCV) and valganciclovir (VGCV), are associated with myelosuppression, which is 
problematic in the HSCT setting.  The use of foscarnet, a second-line agent, is often 
associated with nephrotoxicity.  Cidofovir, typically used as a third-line agent, is associated 
with both myelosuppression and renal impairment.  High doses of acyclovir or valacyclovir
are sometimes used for prophylaxis, but their role in the management of CMV is 
questionable and they are not approved as anti-CMV therapy [Ref. 5.4: 03V285, 03RSYS]. 
In patients at high risk for late CMV infection or disease after 100 days post-transplant, PET 
has been a standard approach. However, PET may be suboptimal for several reasons, 
including: 
•
PET is initiated after patients develop CMV viremia.  A recent study concluded that 
CMV viremia is associated with an increased risk of overall mortality regardless of the 
initiation of PET [Ref. 5.4: 04HYZH].
• Given the toxicities associated with anti-CMV agents, it is important not to initiate PET 
unless it is clear that the benefit outweighs the risks.  However, there is no universally 
accepted viral load threshold for the initiation of PET to guide clinicians when to initiate 
PET [Ref. 5.4: 04JBHN].
•
PET requires frequent monitoring for CMV viremia, which is both burdensome and 
costly [Ref. 5.4: 04JBGP].
Based on the limitations of PET for late CMV infection or disease, a safe and efficacious 
prophylaxis strategy represented a significant advantage.  Thus, there was an unmet medical 
need for an effective and well-tolerated antiviral agent for the prevention of CMV infection 
and disease in HSCT recipients [Ref. 5.4: 04JBGP, 04JBHS, 04HYZL]. Such an agent 
fulfills the need to prevent the direct and indirect effects of CMV viremia. A recent study has 
also found that extending PREVYMIS use beyond week 14 (~100 days) post-allogeneic 
HSCT led to reduced CMV reactivation and could be warranted in patients at high risk of 
developing late-onset CMV disease [Ref. 5.4: 085RL2].
 
 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
The highest risk period for developing CMV infection is during the first 100 days post HSCT 
[Ref. 5.4: 03RTB5]. Risk factors that can further increase probability of CMV infection 
(defining a subset of “high risk” patients) include: older age of recipient, CMV positivity of 
the donor (D+) and transplant-related factors including use of high dose corticosteroids, T-
cell depletion, use of mismatched or unrelated donor and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 
use of T cell depleting agents (antithymocyte globulin, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab), use 
of CD 34+ selected (T cell depleted) transplant, and total body irradiation for conditioning in 
preparation of HSCT transplantation, GVHD, a low CD4 count, and undetectable CMV-
specific T-cell immunity [Ref. 5.4: 04LLX2, 03W7QK, 04J8SD]. The clinical effects of 
CMV infection can be divided into direct and indirect effects [Ref. 5.4: 03RT9X, 03RVMQ].  
The direct effects, which have been extensively described, include the spectrum of CMV 
disease manifestations.  CMV gastroenteritis is a common clinical presentation in this 
population.  While pneumonia is the most serious manifestation, it has become relatively 
infrequent with current pre-emptive therapy strategies for CMV disease [Ref. 5.4: 03RVMQ, 
03RVMS].  Other rarer manifestations of CMV disease include hepatitis, retinitis, and 
encephalitis [Ref. 5.4: 03RT9X, 03RVMQ]. The indirect effects of CMV infection include 
increased risk of opportunistic bacterial and invasive fungal infections, GVHD, and non-
relapse mortality as well as all-cause mortality [Ref. 5.4: 03RVN2, 03RVN6, 03RTB5, 
03RVN7, 03RVN8, 03RVNB, 03RVNC, 04J8SD, 04HYZH].
Important co-morbidities:
Of the 118,782 allogeneic HSCTs reported to have been performed globally from 2006 to 
2010, 85,550 (72%) were associated with underlying leukemias, 17,427 (15%) with 
lymphoproliferative disorders, 14325 (12%) with non-malignant disorders, 722 (<1%) with 
solid tumors and 758 (<1%) had other underlying conditions for receiving HSCT 
[Ref. 5.4: 04J8SG].
In the U.S., acute leukemias (AML, ALL) and MSD accounted for 76% of allo-HSCTs 
[Ref. 5.4: 05N82D].  Similarly in Europe, the main indications for allo-HSCT in 2019 were 
myeloid malignancies (98%) with AML accounting for 38% [Ref. 5.4: 07YS3Z].
HSCT recipients receive cytotoxic antineoplastic agents as components of the pre-HSCT 
conditioning regimen and thereafter experience a prolonged and profound period of 
neutropenia between HSCT and engraftment, during which the HSCT recipient is at high risk 
for infectious post-procedure complications (i.e., bacterial, fungal and/or viral infections).  
HSCT recipients also require immunosuppressive agents such as CsA and tacrolimus to 
prevent rejection and are at risk for GVHD requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids 
(see SI.2).  
HSCT recipients are at increased risk of post-transplant complications including: 
cardiovascular disease [Ref. 5.4: 04M5Z2]; liver disease, including hepatic complications 
due to chronic graft versus host disease [Ref. 5.4: 04M5YV]; renal dysfunction 
 
 
[Ref. 5.4: 04M5YV]; diabetes/metabolic syndrome due to the use of corticosteroids and/or 
calcineurin inhibitors [Ref. 5.4: 04M5YH]; and infectious complications, including those due 
to CMV in CMV seropositive HSCT recipients [Ref. 5.4: 04M5Z8, 04M5YM].
Indication: PREVYMIS is indicated for the prophylaxis of CMV disease in adult kidney 
transplant recipients at high risk (Donor CMV seropositive/Recipient CMV seronegative 
[D+/R-]).
Incidence: D+/R- kidney transplant recipients may acquire CMV infection and disease if the 
virus is transmitted by the transplanted organ to a recipient who does not carry the virus 
[Ref. 5.4: 085JLC]. 
Among all kidney transplant recipients, 64% developed CMV infection and 24% progressed 
to CMV disease in the absence of prophylaxis [Ref. 5.4: 085JLC]. Even with the use of 
current preventive strategies, the incidence of CMV infection and disease may range between 
17%-92% and 0%-37%, respectively [Ref. 5.4: 085RKW]. The subgroup at highest risk of 
post-transplant complications is D+/R- recipients, who have a 28% higher risk of graft loss, 
36% higher risk of all-cause mortality, and eight times the risk of mortality from viral 
infection compared to that of D-/R- recipients (i.e., patients who receive CMV-negative 
blood or leukocyte-depleted blood products during and after transplantation) 
[Ref. 5.4: 085JLC, 085RKW].
Prevalence: In 2016, the kidney transplantation rate in Europe ranged from 17.8 per million 
people in non-EU member states to 38.1 per million people in EU member states 
[Ref. 5.4: 085RLF]. Prevalence was higher in the U.S., where there were 678 kidney 
transplant recipients per million people in 2018 [Ref. 5.4: 085RLJ]. CMV disease occurrence 
was nearly three times higher (56% versus 20%) in D+/R- recipients compared to the D-/R+ 
and D+/R+ subgroups [Ref. 5.4: 04GCTW]. Based on a prior study of 20,000 transplanted 
patients in the US, D+/R- recipients may account for at least 18% of the total kidney 
transplant population [Ref. 5.4: 085JLC].  
Demographics of the population in the authorized Indication and risk factors for the 
disease: 
Based on a study conducted in Norway, kidney transplant recipients who developed CMV 
infection were more likely to have D+/R- CMV IgG antibody status (60.8%) and to be of 
older age (mean age of 50.2 years (standard deviation of 15.0 years)) relative to recipients 
who did not develop CMV infection [Ref. 5.4: 085RLB]. Other risk factors for CMV 
infection across multiple studies included the presence of acute rejection episodes; older 
donor age; use of CsA, antilymphocyte antibodies, or other immunosuppressive drugs; and 
impaired transplant function [Ref. 5.4: 085RLB, 085RKW].
The main existing treatment options: 
There is currently one approach to preventing CMV infection and disease in D+/R- kidney 
transplant recipients: prophylaxis, which involves the administration of VGCV to D+/R-
kidney transplant recipients starting within 10 days post-transplant and continuing for 3-6 
 
 
months or for 1-3 months after treatment with antilymphocyte antibodies or high-dose 
steroids [Ref. 5.4: 085RKW, 085JLC]. 
VGCV is a nucleoside analogue that has toxicities limiting its clinical utility. 
Based on the high occurrence of drug-related toxicity associated with prophylaxis, a safe and 
efficacious preventive strategy would represent a significant advantage over the existing 
treatment option. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for an effective and well-tolerated 
antiviral agent for the prevention of CMV infection and disease in D+/R- kidney transplant 
recipients [Ref. 5.4: 04JBGP, 04JBHS, 04HYZL, 085RKW]. Such an agent fulfills the need 
to prevent the direct and indirect effects of CMV viremia and could be used prophylactically.
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
The subgroup of kidney transplant recipients at highest risk of developing CMV infection 
and disease includes D+/R- patients [Ref. 5.4: 085JLC]. In addition to CMV IgG antibody 
status, risk factors that can increase the probability of CMV infection are older age of the 
recipient, older age of the donor, presence of acute rejection episodes, exposure to 
immunosuppressive drugs, and impaired transplant function [Ref. 5.4: 085RLB, 085RKW]. 
The clinical effects of CMV infection can be divided further into direct and indirect effects 
[Ref. 5.4: 03RT9X, 03RVMQ, 085JLC].  
The direct effects, which have been extensively described, include the spectrum of CMV 
disease manifestations.  CMV gastroenteritis is a common clinical presentation in this 
population.  While pneumonia is the most serious manifestation, it has become relatively 
infrequent with current PET strategies for CMV disease [Ref. 5.4: 03RVMQ, 03RVMS].  
Other manifestations of CMV disease include hepatitis, pancreatitis, retinitis, encephalitis, 
and invasive disease in other tissues [Ref. 5.4: 03RT9X, 03RVMQ, 085JLC]. The indirect 
effects of CMV infection include increased risk of opportunistic bacterial and invasive fungal 
infections, GVHD, and non-relapse mortality as well as all-cause mortality 
[Ref. 5.4: 03RVN2, 03RVN6, 03RTB5, 03RVN7, 03RVN8, 03RVNB, 03RVNC, 04J8SD, 
04HYZH, 085JLC].
In a series of prospective studies of a large Norwegian cohort of kidney transplant recipients 
who did not receive universal prophylaxis or PET, both CMV infection and disease were 
associated with several post-transplant complications. CMV infection may increase the risk 
of new-onset post-transplant diabetes through reduced insulin secretion. In a subgroup 
analysis, the incidence of new-onset diabetes was four times higher in kidney transplant 
recipients with CMV infection relative to those without CMV infection (26% versus 6%) 
[Ref. 5.4: 04GCTW]. CMV occurrence was a significant risk factor for clinical acute 
allograft rejection during the first 100 days post-transplantation [Ref. 5.4: 04GCTW]. 
Relative to no CMV infection, asymptomatic CMV infection and disease were independent 
risk factors for overall renal recipient mortality more than 100 days after transplantation and 
significantly reduced graft survival when deaths with functioning grafts were included 
[Ref. 5.4: 04GCTW]. CMV disease was also a significant predictor of biopsy-verified acute 
 
 
tubulointerstitial rejection and has been associated with an increased risk of long-term 
mortality across several studies [Ref. 5.4: 04GCTW].
Important co-morbidities:
Patients eligible for kidney transplantation typically have end stage renal disease (ESRD) 
with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 [Ref. 5.4: 085RLJ]. Among 
kidney transplant recipients in the U.S. in 2019, half had either diabetes mellitus (30%) or 
hypertension (20%) as the listed cause of ESRD, whereas glomerulonephritis (18%) and 
cystic kidney disease (13%) were less common [Ref. 5.4: 085RLJ].
 
 
PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage:
An extensive nonclinical safety pharmacology and toxicological program was conducted to 
support the filing and registration of letermovir.  This program included safety pharmacology 
studies in both in vitro and in vivo test systems to assess potential effects on main 
physiological functions, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, oral and IV acute 
toxicity studies in rats and mice, repeat-dose oral toxicity studies (up to 3, 6, and 9 months in 
duration in mice, rats, and monkeys, respectively), 4-week intravenous dose toxicity studies 
in rats and monkeys, local IV tolerability studies in rats and rabbits, and a 6-month 
carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice.  In addition, a series of reproductive and 
developmental studies in rats and rabbits, and a juvenile male toxicity study in rats were 
conducted.  
The important nonclinical safety findings are summarized in Table SII.1.  In this document, 
the nonclinical/clinical exposure (AUC) and Cmax ratios are calculated based on the clinical 
AUC for letermovir of 99,960 nghr/mL and Cmax of 21,570 ng/mL achieved at 480 mg IV 
in HSCT patients, which is the most conservative approach for safety margin calculation as 
this regimen resulted in the highest exposures in patients. The projected IV exposure of LET 
in the kidney transplant population is comparable to the IV exposure in HSCT recipients (see 
[Sec. 2.7.2.3.1.1]).
Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies)
Single and repeat-dose toxicity:
Relevance to human usage
In controlled Phase 3 P001 clinical trial in HSCT 
patients, the most commonly reported gastrointestinal 
adverse events in the letermovir group were diarrhea 
(26.0%), nausea (26.5%), and vomiting (18.5%). In 
Phase 3 P040 clinical trial in HSCT patients, nausea, 
diarrhea and vomiting were reported (11.1%, 11.8% 
and 4.2%, respectively). The overall rate for these 
adverse events was generally similar to or lower than 
the rate observed in the placebo group in both studies.
In Phase 3 P002 clinical trial in kidney transplant 
patients, the most frequently reported gastrointestinal 
adverse events were also nausea (8.6%), diarrhea 
(31.5%) and vomiting (6.2%) that were reported in 
lower proportions compared to the active comparator.
Therefore, gastrointestinal adverse effects are not 
considered important risks for the product.
 
 
Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies)
Tolerability
Letermovir, when administered orally to mice for 13 
weeks, was well tolerated up to the highest dose 
tested, 250 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 
357,250 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~3.5X).
Letermovir was also well tolerated in rats, when 
administered orally up to 150 mg/kg/day (high dose)
for 26 weeks (mean systemic exposure: 657,750 
ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~6.5X), or intravenously 
up to 100 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks (mean systemic 
exposure: 682,934 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~7X).  
Dose-limiting toxicity, characterized by emesis, loss 
of appetite, soft and watery feces, body weight 
loss/reduced body weight gain at ≥250 mg/kg/day 
(mean systemic exposure: 609,500 ng.hr/mL; 
exposure margin ~6X) or intravenous doses ≥150 
mg/kg/day (systemic exposure not measured), 
resulting in morbidity/mortality at oral doses 
≥300 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 
1,435,120 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~14X) was 
achieved in monkeys.  Oral or IV doses up to 100 
mg/kg/day (exposure multiples of <1X for oral and 
4X for oral) were well tolerated by monkeys.
Toxicity target organs
The letermovir toxicity target organs, the testes, 
appear to be species-specific (identified in rats only).  
The testicular toxicity consisted of vacuolation of the 
germinal epithelium, germ cell exfoliation, tubular 
atrophy and damage to Sertoli cells, associated with 
oligospermia and cell debris in the epididymides,
and decreased testes and epididymides weights at 
doses ≥180 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 
329,865 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~3X).  In a male 
fertility study, the testicular toxicity observed after 
approximately 15 weeks of dosing at 180 mg/kg/day 
was shown to be associated with decreased Inhibin B 
plasma concentrations and was shown to not be 
reversible after a 15-week treatment-free period.  
There were no male reproductive organ changes at 
60 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 80,628 
ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~1X). Importantly, there 
were no male reproductive organ changes and no 
changes in any male sexual hormones, including 
Inhibin B, in Cynomolgus monkeys administered 
letermovir up to 250/200 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks 
(mean systemic exposure: 204,900 ng.hr/mL; 
exposure margin ~2X), and no male reproductive 
toxicity in mice administered letermovir up to 
Relevance to human usage
Testicular toxicity in rats appears to be species-
specific. In the Phase 3 trials in HSCT recipients 
(P001) and in kidney transplant recipients (P002), there 
was no evidence of letermovir-related testicular 
toxicity in male subjects based on analysis of 
biomarkers used to monitor gonadotoxicity (serum 
inhibin B, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone).  In 
P001, the shift in values for each of the four hormone 
levels from baseline was comparable in the letermovir 
and the placebo groups, both at the end of treatment 
(EOT) and the Week 24 post-transplant visit.  The 
proportions of subjects with markers indicative of 
abnormal testicular function (low inhibin B and high 
FSH) were similar in the letermovir and placebo 
groups at the Week 24 post-transplant visit. However, 
these findings were confounded by the impact of 
induction chemotherapy on testicular function. Further
evaluation of biomarkers of testicular toxicity in 
kidney transplant recipients was conducted in the 
Phase 3 study (P002). There was no indication of 
abnormal testicular function (low inhibin B and high 
FSH), based on the absence of clinically relevant shift 
from baseline in mean inhibin B and FSH levels in the 
letermovir group at weeks 28 and 52. Letermovir 
treatment had no observed impact on sex hormone

Studies
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies)
250 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 357,250 
ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~4X) for 13 weeks.  
There were no male reproductive organ changes 
noted in a 2-week juvenile toxicity study conducted 
in rats of 14-day up to 180 mg/kg/day (age at study 
start: 14-days).  
In the intravenous study in rats with letermovir, non-
adverse vacuolation noted in the kidneys was 
attributed to the high dose of 1500 mg/kg/day of 
cyclodextrin excipient, hydroxypropylbetadex. It is 
known that cyclodextrins can cause kidney 
vacuolation in rats when given intravenously at 
doses > 50 mg/kg/day. 
Reproductive and embryo-fetal developmental 
toxicity: 
In the fertility and early embryonic development 
study in the rat, there were no effects of letermovir 
on female fertility up to the highest dose tested, 
240 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 482,910 
ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~5X).  Decreased male 
fertility was observed in rats at ≥180 mg/kg/day 
(mean systemic exposure: 355,000 ng.hr/mL; 
exposure margin ~3X) and were likely secondary to 
the testicular toxicity.
There was no male reproductive organ toxicity 
observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys 
and mice even though these animals had higher 
systemic exposures to letermovir than those achieved 
in rat studies of similar duration.
Relevance to human usage
(LH, FSH, testosterone, and inhibin B) levels in male 
kidney transplant recipients in P002.
Therefore, the nonclinical finding of testicular toxicity 
is not considered an identified or potential risk for 
human use.
The anticipated clinical exposure to 
hydroxypropylbetadex with intravenously administered 
letermovir is expected to be approximately 3600 
mg/day (72 mg/kg/day, for a human weight of 50 kg) 
for a letermovir dose of 480 mg.  In patients with 
moderate to severe renal dysfunction accumulation of 
cyclodextrin is expected to occur. 
Hydroxypropylbetadex amounts of approximately 250 
mg/kg/day for 21 days were found to be safe in humans 
older than 2 years [Ref. 5.4: 04KNRJ].  There were no 
cases of kidney injury in human studies of 
intravenously administered letermovir with treatment 
durations of up to 47 days.  The numbers of patients 
with moderate or severe renal impairment (at time of 
enrollment) in the Phase 3 P001 trial in HSCT 
recipients were limited. In Phase 3 P002 and P040 
clinical trials, exposure to IV formulation was 
infrequent: 1 participant received IV letermovir for a 
duration of 2 days in P040, and 3 participants received 
IV letermovir with the mean duration of 1.7 days in 
P002.
Therefore, the nonclinical finding is not considered an 
identified or potential risk for human use.
Testicular toxicity in rats appears to be species-
specific. In the Phase 3 trials in HSCT recipients
(P001) and kidney transplant recipients (P002), there

biomarkers used to monitor gonadotoxicity (serum 
inhibin B, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-

Therefore, the nonclinical finding is not considered an

Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies)
In the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies in 
rats and rabbits, developmental toxicity including 
common spontaneous malformations (additional 
lumbar/pelvic shift) and common skeletal variations 
(additional rib), was observed at doses associated 
with maternal toxicity (body weight loss, vaginal 
discharge, and morbidity (in rabbits only)), 
250 mg/kg/day in rats (mean systemic exposure:
1,095,279 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~11X) and 
225 mg/kg/day in rabbits (mean systemic exposure:
170,211ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~2X).  The 
maternal and developmental NOAEL was 
50 mg/kg/day in rats (mean systemic exposure: 
258,731 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~2.5X) and 
75 mg/kg/day in rabbits (mean systemic exposure: 
47,355 ng.hr/mL; exposure margin: <1X).  
Importantly, in the embryo-fetal toxicity 
developmental studies in rats and rabbits, there were 
no letermovir-related effects on developing male 
reproductive organs.  Moreover, in the pre- and 
postnatal development study in rats, there was no 
developmental toxicity up to the highest dose tested 
of 180 mg/kg/day (mean systemic exposure: 225,157 
ng.hr/mL; exposure margin ~2X).
Genotoxicity: 
There was no evidence for genotoxicity in in vitro or 
in vivo testing, including Ames assay (bacterial 
reverse mutation assay), Chinese hamster lung cell 
chromosomal aberration assay and an in vivo assay 
for micronucleus induction in mouse bone marrow. 
The top dose was the limit dose or was limited by 
cytotoxicity in the in vitro genetic toxicity studies 
and was the maximum tolerated dose in the in vivo 
genetic toxicity study in mice.
Carcinogenicity:
The 6-month oral carcinogenicity study in rasH2 
transgenic mice showed no evidence of human-
relevant carcinogenic potential.
Relevance to human usage
No adequate human data are available to establish 
whether or not letermovir poses a risk to pregnancy 
outcomes. Therefore, letermovir should be used in 
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.
Letermovir does not present a genotoxic risk to 
humans. 
Letermovir does not represent a risk of carcinogenicity 
to humans, based on results of the 6-month oral 
carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice which 
showed no evidence of human-relevant carcinogenic 
potential, the absence of genotoxicity in in vitro or in 
vivo testing, and the absence of a proliferative signal in 
the chronic toxicity studies.
 
 
Table SII.1:
Summary of Important Safety Findings from Non-clinical 
Studies
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies)
Safety Pharmacology:
Letermovir was tested for potential effects on 
cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous 
systems in well characterized safety pharmacology 
experimental models.  There were no changes of 
concern, specifically no changes in blood pressure, 
heart rate and ECG parameters in non-clinical 
studies with letermovir. Therefore, letermovir was 
devoid of any effects of concern.
Intravenous (IV) local tolerance:
Local tolerance of the hydroxypropylbetadex clinical 
letermovir IV formulation (20% 
hydroxypropylbetadex solution) was evaluated in 28-
day rat and monkey IV studies and in a local 
tolerability IV study in rabbits. In these studies, there 
was no evidence of major local intolerability of the 
formulations up to the highest letermovir 
concentration tested (20 mg/mL), the only local 
changes consisting of microscopic findings of 
myopathy / myositis and cellulitis at the injection 
sites in monkeys administered the formulation 
containing 20 mg/mL of letermovir. There was 
evidence of partial reversal of these microscopic 
changes after the 2-week treatment-free period. .
Relevance to human usage
The nonclinical data do not indicate a potential for 
neurological, cardiovascular or respiratory effects in 
humans.
Letermovir specifically targets the CMV-encoded 
terminase, for which there is no human homologue.  
There were no preclinical cardiac findings and no 
findings in the Phase 1 thorough QT trial to indicate 
that letermovir prolongs the QTc interval to a clinically 
relevant extent or has a pro-arrhythmic potential.  
Animal data did not indicate any concern relative to the 
local tolerance of the clinical IV formulation of 
letermovir.  Infusion-site AEs were reported in two 
Phase 1 studies (n=50 subjects; P017 and P018) with 
the arginine formulation leading to premature 
discontinuation of the formulation.  Phase 1 studies 
(n=90 subjects) with single doses of IV letermovir 
(hydroxypropylbetadex formulation) up to 960 mg and 
multiple doses up to 480 mg once daily were 
specifically evaluated for venous tolerability. No dose-
limiting administration site toxicity was observed over 
this range of doses up to a maximum of 7 days of IV 
dosing. In the Phase 3 trial P001, infusion site reactions 
were unusual, and infusions were generally well 
tolerated for durations up to 47 days. Only 2 subjects 
in the letermovir group reported mild drug-related 
injection site AEs (erythema and inflammation).   The 
infusion site thrombosis AEs observed in 13 (26%) of 
subjects who received the arginine formulation in 
Phase 1 was not observed with the 
hydroxypropylbetadex formulation. 
In Phase 3 P002 and P040 clinical trials, exposure to 
IV formulation was infrequent: 1 participant received 
IV letermovir for a duration of 2 days in P040, and 3 
participants received IV letermovir with the mean 
duration of 1.7 days in P002. No administration site 
reactions were reported in P040. In P002, one subject 
had infusion site bruising.
Therefore, infusion site reactions are not considered 
important identified or potential risks for the 
formulation of intravenous letermovir.
 
 
Conclusions on Non-clinical Data
The nonclinical safety profile of letermovir has been well characterized in a series of in vitro
and in vivo studies in multiples species (rodent and non-rodent). The only target organ of 
toxicity identified at microscopic examination was the male reproductive system, which 
appears to be species specific (rat only).  The lack of findings in the male reproductive 
system following letermovir dosing in monkeys for 39 weeks and mice for 13 weeks, and the 
results of the evaluation of biomarkers of testicular toxicity in the Phase 3 studies in HSCT 
and kidney transplant recipients which showed no evidence of letermovir-related testicular 
toxicity in humans supports the argument that the findings were species-specific. Therefore, 
the missing information of “Abnormal findings in rat fertility studies with an unknown 
significance to male patients” is proposed for removal from the Summary of important safety 
findings from non-clinical studies.
Embryofetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternally toxic systemic exposures 
(approximately 11- and 2-fold, respectively, the exposure at the recommended human dose 
(RHD)). No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not letermovir poses a 
risk to pregnancy outcomes.  The potential risk for humans is unknown.  
In conclusion, the nonclinical profile supports the safe use of letermovir at the approved 
clinical dose for the prevention of CMV infection in hematopoietic stem cell and kidney 
transplant recipients administered via both the oral and the intravenous route.

PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
A summary of the overall extent of exposure to letermovir, placebo and active control in the 
clinical development program is presented in Table SIII.1.  These data include completed
Phase 1 trials in healthy adult subjects and subjects with renal or hepatic impairment and 
completed Phase 2 and 3 trials in mainly kidney/pancreatic transplant (P019), HSCT (P020, 
P001, P040) and kidney transplant (P002) recipients.  The summary of subject exposure in 
the following tables includes data from 1675 subjects exposed to letermovir in the clinical 
development program; of these, 750 were healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic or renal 
impairment in Phase 1 trials, and 925 were subjects in Phase 2 and 3 trials. In the completed 
Phase 3 trials (P001, P002, and P040), the protocol-specified dose of letermovir was 480 mg 
QD with a dose adjustment of 240 mg QD when administered in combination with CsA.  For 
the purposes of presenting exposure by indication, both dose regimens of letermovir (480 mg 
and 240 mg + CsA) are summarized together in Table SIII.1.

Includes 32 Phase 1 trials. 
The Phase 2 trials were P019 and P020.
The Phase 3 trials were P001 , P002 and P040.  
Letermovir treatment includes the treatment groups of letermovir alone and letermovir + other drugs in Phase 1 trials, and  
letermovir alone in Phase 2 and 3 trials.  In the Phase 1 trials, n=12 subjects received both oral tablet and IV arginine formulations 
of letermovir and are therefore included in both the oral and IV categories. Of those who received IV in the Phase 3 trials, only 6 
received IV only. All others received IV and oral.
|| Other treatment includes comparators for Phase 1 DDI trials.
¶
Subjects in the active control group (observational) of the Phase 2a trial (P019) received local Standard of Care (SOC).  
Phase 1
The exposure data from Phase 1 trials includes 32 Clinical Pharmacology trials for letermovir 
in which 848 subjects (including special populations) were enrolled and received at least 1 
dose of study drug (letermovir, other drug or placebo).  Data are available from healthy 
subjects and subjects with hepatic or renal impairment; all are referred to as ‘subjects’.
Single dose (SD) administration of letermovir up to 960 mg once daily (QD) and multiple 
dose (MD) administration up to 720 mg twice daily (BID) were evaluated across the 32 trials.  
Of the 848 subjects administered at least one dose of trial drug, 750 received at least one dose 
of letermovir (either alone or in combination with another drug).  Of these, 710 received the 
 
 
dose of 480 mg letermovir and 26 received the dose of 240 mg letermovir coadministered 
with CsA.  This overall exposure to letermovir includes both oral (oral solution and oral 
tablet) and intravenous (IV; arginine and hydroxypropyl betadex) formulations. 
Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial Exposure by Duration of Exposure
The durations of exposure in phase 2 and 3 trials for letermovir are shown in Table SIII.2
through Table SIII.5.  Both dosing regimens (480 mg once daily and 240 mg once daily with 
CsA) were summarized as one letermovir treatment group for the analysis of extent of 
exposure and safety.  
Phase 2
P019 was an open-label, proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of letermovir compared to active control (oral valganciclovir), when given 
over a period of 14 days.  Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:  40 
mg BID letermovir; 80 mg QD letermovir; or an active control.  
P020  was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of letermovir versus placebo as prophylaxis in a total of 131 subjects. Subjects were 
randomized to 1 of 3 different dose groups of letermovir (60, 120, or 240 mg QD) or placebo. 
Treatment was given orally for 84 days. 
Phase 3
P001 was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of letermovir versus placebo for prophylaxis of clinically significant CMV infection in 
adult, CMV-seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients (R+). A total of 570 allogeneic HSCT 
recipients (R+) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive letermovir or placebo at any time 
from the day of transplant through 28 days post-transplant. The dose of letermovir used in 
P001 was 480 mg QD with a dose adjustment to 240 mg QD when given concomitantly with 
CsA. The duration of treatment for an individual participant varied from 10 to 14 weeks post-
transplant because a subject could be randomized to treatment at any time over a period of 28 
days following transplantation. However, all subjects were to complete treatment at the same 
time point post-transplant, i.e. Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant.  
P002 was a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of letermovir versus valganciclovir for the prevention of CMV Disease in 
Adult [D+/R-] kidney transplant recipients. A total of 601 D+/R- kidney transplant recipients
were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to letermovir or VGCV at any time from the day of transplant 
through 7 days post-transplant. The dose of letermovir used was 480 mg QD with a dose 
adjustment to 240 mg QD when given concomitantly with CsA. Each individual participant 
received study medication for 200 days post-transplant.
P040 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment, multicenter, double-blind, 
efficacy and safety study evaluating extending letermovir prophylaxis to 200 days post-
transplant in CMV-seropositive recipients (R+) of an allogeneic HSCT who had received 
letermovir prophylaxis through Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant and who were at high 
 
 
risk for CMV infection and/or disease after completion letermovir prophylaxis through 100 
days posttransplant. Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive letermovir 
through Week 28 (LET through 200 days) post-transplant or to receive placebo through 
Week 28 (LET through 100 days) post-transplant. The dose of letermovir used was 480 mg 
QD with a dose adjustment to 240 mg QD when given concomitantly with CsA.

PART II: MODULE SIV - POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL TRIALS
SIV.1
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Program
There were exclusion criteria in the phase 3 trials (P001, P002, ad P040) that had the aim of 
facilitating evaluation of efficacy and ensuring that patients were able to complete the study. 
Most of the exclusion criteria are not relevant to post-approval treatment with letermovir and 
none of these criteria reflects a safety concern with letermovir.
Table SIV.1.1:
Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the 
Development Program
Rationale (if not Included as 
Missing Information)
These patients would receive the 
same recommended regimen for 
CMV prophylaxis as first-time or 
single organ transplant recipients.
There are no data to support dosing 
recommendations for patients with 
creatinine clearance less than 10 
mL/min or on dialysis or 
plasmapheresis.  This limitation 
has been included in product 
labeling.
No additional studies are planned 
in this population.

transplant, or multi 
organ recipient (P002)
Creatinine clearance

Potential to confound study results
No
No
No data were available from 
clinical studies to support safety in 
patients with creatinine clearance 
less than 10 mL/min or on dialysis 
or plasmapheresis. 
However, there are PK data 
available from the Phase 1 renal 
impairment study  in  8 patients 
with severe renal impairment. 
(creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). 
The IV formulation of letermovir 
contains the excipient 
hydroxypropylbetadex 
(hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin), 
which may accumulate in patients 
with severe renal impairment.  At 
high doses (> 50 mg/kg/day) 
accumulation of cyclodextrins can 
cause kidney vacuolation in animals 
when given intravenously. It is 
unknown whether accumulation can 
result in toxicity in humans.
Patients with post-transplant 
creatinine clearance less than 10 
mL/min or on dialysis or 
plasmapheresis suggests the 
transplant was compromised the 
results of which could have 
confounded study analyses. 
Additionally, the effect of dialysis 
on letermovir exposure is not 
known.

Exclusion Criterion
Reason for Exclusion
Severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh 
Class C)
Based on Phase 1 PK data the 
increase in letermovir exposures is 
> 3-fold for subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment.
Moderate hepatic 
impairment AND 
moderate or severe 
renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance of 
less than 50 mL/min)
History of CMV end-
organ disease or 
initiation of PET for 
CMV (P001) history of 
CMV disease or 
suspected CMV disease 
(P002) within 6 months 
HIV or active chronic 
HBV/HCV co infection
(P001/P040)
No data are available in subjects 
with moderate hepatic AND 
moderate to severe renal 
insufficiency Based on Phase 1 PK 
data, the suggested increase in 
letermovir exposure is  > 3-fold for 
subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh-B) 
combined with moderate or severe 
renal impairment. 
Pre-existing or recent CMV end 
organ disease could confound the 
assessment of clinically significant 
CMV infection as well as 
assessment of safety during the 
placebo-controlled trial 
Pre-existing diseases would 
confound the assessment of efficacy 
and safety endpoints during the 
study.
No
Pediatric patients
The safety and efficacy of 
letermovir in adolescents and 
children < 18 years of age have not 
been established.
No
Pregnant women
The safety and efficacy of 
letermovir in pregnant women have 
not been established. 
No
Rationale (if not Included as 
Missing Information)
There are no data to support dosing 
recommendations for patients with 
severe hepatic impairment.
Administration of letermovir to 
patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is not recommended in 
product labeling.
Administration of letermovir is not 
recommended in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment 
combined with moderate or severe 
renal impairment (SmPC Sec. 2.7).
Patients remain at high risk for 
clinically significant CMV 
infection or disease and may 
benefit from prophylaxis. The 
safety and efficacy established in 
completed clinical trials is relevant 
to this population
Such patients remain at high risk 
for clinically significant CMV 
infection or disease and may 
benefit from prophylaxis. The 
safety and efficacy of letermovir 
prophylaxis established in 
completed clinical trials is relevant 
to this population
The completed Phase 3 clinical 
trials were conducted in adult 
HSCT and kidney transplant
recipients only.
Letermovir is not indicated in 
children and adolescents under 18 
years of age (SmPC Sec 6.4).
It is unlikely that pregnant women 
will undergo HSCT or a kidney 
transplant. It is also unlikely that
patients post-HSCT or kidney 
transplantation would become 
pregnant within the first year post-
transplant due to the use of other 
concomitant medications and 
therapies with significant risk to 
the fetus (SmPC Sec 6.1)

Exclusion Criterion
Reason for Exclusion
Breastfeeding Mothers
The safety and efficacy of 
letermovir in women who are 
breastfeeding have not been 
established.  
Is it Considered to 
be Missing 
Information?
No
Rationale (if not Included as 
Missing Information)
It is unlikely that women will 
continue to breastfeed during 
HSCT or kidney transplantation
and the post transplantation phase 
due to the use of 
immunosuppressive therapies that 
carry risk to the infant (SmPC Sec 
6.2).

PART II: MODULE SV - POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPERIENCE
SV.1 Post-Authorisation Exposure
SV.1.1
Method Used to Calculate Exposure
A summary of the worldwide distribution of letermovir for the cumulative period from 
market introduction to 01-NOV-200221 is presented in Table SV1.2.1 based on the available 
data. This estimation was based upon the usual dose of letermovir of 480 mg once daily (or 
240 mg once daily for patients who receive cyclosporine) and the usual duration of therapy 
of up to 100 days post-transplant, depending on the degree of immunosuppression. This 
estimation was based upon clinical trial experience with prophylaxis in HSCT recipients 
where patient exposure was comprised of a mean duration of 14.1 days of intravenous 
administration of letermovir, 66.7 days of oral tablet administration, and a mean duration of 
69.4 days of exposure to either formulation for both strengths of letermovir (480 mg once 
daily, or 240 mg once daily for patients receiving co-administration of cyclosporine, which 
was approximately 50% of the HSCT patients). 
The estimated patient exposure is based upon Patient Years of Treatment (PYT) = Patient 
Treatment Days /365.25 (1 Patient Treatment Day is one vial or one tablet of either 240 mg 
or 480 mg strength), therefore the total number of tablets and total number of vials (patient 
treatment days) was divided by 365.25 to estimate patient treatment years.
Patient exposure estimates were calculated from our Company’s internal distribution data 
from the Worldwide Financial Reporting System (WFRS), and the Financial Sharing Area 
database(s). Patient exposure estimates were calculated from expanded distribution 
categories to provide a more accurate estimate of patient exposure worldwide. The effects of 
this update may be apparent when comparing current estimates of patient exposure to those 
of prior reporting periods. 
It is important to note the estimated PYT are not equivalent to the absolute number of 
patients treated. Overall PYT estimates are likely to underestimate the true number of 
patients exposed to letermovir due to the fact that PYT estimates are calculated assuming one 
year of treatment.
SV.1.2
Exposure
The estimated number of doses of letermovir distributed worldwide from market introduction 
through 01-NOV-2022 is 8,062,246. This corresponds to 22,073 estimated PYT.
1
The estimate of patient exposure from market introduction is based on the availability of monthly drug distribution figures; hence, this 
estimate has been calculated from market introduction to 31-OCT-2022, rather than from market introduction to 01-NOV-2022

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT
Summary of risk management plan for Prevymis® (letermovir)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Prevymis®. The RMP details 
important risks of Prevymis®, and how more information will be obtained about 
Prevymis®’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Prevymis®'s summary of product characteristics SmPC and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Prevymis® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Prevymis® should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Prevymis® 's RMP.
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used for
Prevymis® is authorised for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and disease 
in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT). PREVYMIS is also indicated for prophylaxis of CMV disease in CMV-
seronegative adults who have received a kidney transplant from a CMV-seropositive donor 
[D+/R-] (see SmPC for the full indication).
It contains letermovir as the active substance and it is given by oral tablets (240mg and 
480mg) and as concentrate for solution for infusion (20mg/mL, 240mg and 20mg/mL, 
480mg).
Further information about the evaluation of Prevymis®’s benefits can be found in 
Prevymis®’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/rmp-
summary/prevymis-epar-risk-management-plan-summary_en.pdf.
II.
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Prevymis®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the
proposed studies for learning more about Prevymis®'s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken 
as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Prevymis® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Prevymis®. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

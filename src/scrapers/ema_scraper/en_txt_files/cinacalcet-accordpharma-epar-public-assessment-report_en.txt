2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Abnormal parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, both as a primary or secondary condition, is one of 
the most common endocrine derangements. 
Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is an endocrinopathy characterised by overproduction of 
parathormone (PTH) due to a solitary adenoma (80%) or to multiple adenomas (5%), to hyperplasia 
(15%) and, rarely, (<1%) to carcinoma of the parathyroid glands. It is the third most common 
endocrine disorder, with a prevalence of 3 per 1,000 in the general population. The condition is 
characterised by hypercalcaemia and is variably associated with mineral bone loss and nephrolithiasis. 
Parathyroidectomy is the most commonly proposed therapy for primary HPT. There are currently only 
few nonsurgical treatment alternatives for patients for whom surgery failed or for whom surgery is 
precluded because of contraindications. 
Secondary HPT related to chronic renal failure (chronic kidney disease, CKD) is the most common 
secondary form of parathyroid gland dysfunction. Secondary HPT is characterised as a maladaptive 
process that develops in response to declining kidney and myocardial function, primary aldosteronism, 
impaired phosphate elimination, and failure to bioactivate vitamin D. The hallmarks of secondary HPT 
are a relative deficiency of extracellular calcium (Ca), elevated extracellular phosphate and reduced 
serum calcitriol. Secondary HPT is a common and serious disease that develops early in CKD when 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) drops below 80 mL/min. Untreated, secondary HPT in CKD leads to 
significant skeletal toxicity including osteomalacia and osteodystrophy, as well as to extraskeletal 
damage including vascular calcification, peri-articular Ca deposits and an impaired cardiac function 
seriously increasing the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Conventional treatment options include dietary 
phosphate restriction, use of Ca and non-Ca based phosphate binders and vitamin D sterols, all of 
which targets a normalisation of the Ca/P/vitamin D axis and as a consequence, PTH levels. However, 
conventional treatments may lead to increases in Ca and/or phosphorus (P), which may preclude 
continuous, effective therapy. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The  active  substance  in  the  medicinal  product  in  question  is  cinacalcet  hydrochloride.  The 
pharmacotherapeutic  group  of  cinacalcet  is  calcium  homeostasis  (ATC-code  H05),  anti-parathyroid 
agents (ATC-code H05B). 
Cinacalcet is approved in the EU for  
- 
Treatment  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  (HPT)  in  adult  patients  with  end-stage  renal 
disease 
(ESRD)  on  maintenance  dialysis 
therapy  and 
treatment  of 
secondary 
hyperparathyroidism  (HPT)  in  children  aged  3  years  and  older  with  end-stage  renal  disease 
(ESRD)  on  maintenance  dialysis  therapy  in  whom  secondary  HPT  is  not  adequately  controlled 
with standard of care therapy 
-  Reduction of hypercalcaemia in adult patients with parathyroid carcinoma or with primary HPT 
for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels (as defined 
by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate 
or is contraindicated. 
This is also the indication applied for by Accord Healthcare S.L.U.. 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 10/33 
 
 
 
Cinacalcet is taken orally and comes in tablet form in three strengths (30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg) or, 
for the Originator Mimpara, in granules in capsules (1 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg). The tablet should not be 
split, chewed, or crushed. Cinacalcet should be taken with food or after a meal for increased absorption 
of the medication. Cinacalcet dosing is patient dependent and individualized.  
Cinacalcet  is  a  drug  that  acts  as  a  calcimimetic  (i.e.  it  mimics  the  action  of  calcium  in  the  body)  by 
allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues. 
The calcium-sensing receptors on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland are the principal 
regulator  of  parathyroid  hormone  secretion  (PTH).  Cinacalcet  increases  the  sensitivity  of  calcium 
receptors  on  parathyroid  cells  to  reduce  parathyroid  hormone  (PTH)  levels  and  thus  decrease  serum 
calcium levels. The reduction in PTH levels also leads to a decrease in blood calcium levels. Reduction in 
PTH levels correlate with cinacalcet concentration. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The applicable CHMP Guidelines were mostly followed.  
The Applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg of cinacalcet 
hydrochloride as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
-  Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, magnesium stearate 
-  Tablet coat: hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin, FD&C blue/indigo carmine 
aluminum lake (E132), iron oxide yellow (E172)  
The product is available in a clear PVC/Aluminium blister or in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle 
with a child-resistant polypropylene (PP) cap.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The INN of the active substance is cinacalcet. It is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph 
Eur). A draft monograph is however available in United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary (USP 
NF) 42(4). 
The chemical name of cinacalcet hydrochloride is [(1R)-1-(naphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]({3-[3-
(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propyl})amine hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula 
C22H22F3N · HCl. It has a relative molecular mass 393.9 and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 11/33 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Structure of cinacalcet hydrochloride 
Cinacalcet hydrochloride is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, BCS class IV 
drug, soluble in methanol and ethanol, insoluble in water. The pH of a suspension of cinacalcet in water 
at a concentration of 1% w/v at about 25°C is 5.80 – 5.81. 
The chemical structure has been adequately demonstrated by elemental analysis, ultraviolet (UV) 
spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1H- and 13C- nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and thermal analysis by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). 
Cinacalcet exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre. The R-enantiomer is 
the more potent enantiomer and has been shown to be responsible for the pharmacodynamic activity. 
The S-isomer is controlled in the active substance specification as an impurity by HPLC analysis.  
Polymorphism has been observed for cinacalcet hydrochloride. Three different polymorphic forms of 
the active substance have been identified in literature. Of these polymorphs, only one form is stable at 
ambient temperature. Consistent manufacture of this desired polymorphic form has been confirmed by 
the manufacturer. It has also been shown that the polymorphic form remains stable during storage 
conditions and there is no conversion to other polymorphs.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The information on the active substance has been provided according to the Active Substance Master 
File (ASMF) procedure. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been 
provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance intended for the proposed commercial process is obtained from a single 
manufacturer. 
The active substance is synthesized in 7 main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. This includes two steps to obtain the intermediate and five steps to obtain 
the active substance. 
Two starting materials were proposed. A major objection was raised in relation to one of the proposed 
starting materials as it is only introduced in the last chemical synthesis step and therefore not in line 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 12/33 
 
 
 
 
 
with the principles outlined in ICH Q11. In response, the applicant redefined the starting material 
which was considered acceptable.  
Characterization data, specifications, test methods, name and addresses of suppliers and a flow chart 
of the synthesis are provided for the defined starting materials. The potential impurities identified from 
the route of synthesis are discussed. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. The 
discussion on impurities included organic and inorganic impurities, metal catalysts/elemental impurities 
and residual solvents. The proposed limits for related substances are in general in line with the USP NF 
Draft Monograph. However, a major objection was raised in relation to one impurity for which a higher 
limit as compared to the monograph was proposed. The manufacturer presented batch analysis data, 
stability data and a purging study to demonstrate the absence of the impurity in the final active 
substance. The method description, typical chromatograms and validation report were also provided 
upon request and the major objection was thereby considered resolved.  
In the context of the on-going review under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 related to the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-information-
nitrosamines-marketing-authorisation-holders_en.pdf, 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-questions-
answers-information-nitrosamines-marketing-authorisation_en.pdf), MAHs of products containing 
chemically-synthesized active substances are being asked to review their products for potential 
presence of nitrosamine impurities and to conduct risk evaluations/risk assessments as appropriate.  
No risk evaluation has been submitted for Cinacalcet Accordpharma within the current procedure. 
Therefore, it is recommended that a risk evaluation on the potential risk of presence of nitrosamine in 
Cinacalcet Accordpharma is conducted after the marketing authorisation, within six months of the 
publication of the call for review (19th September 2019). In the event that a risk of presence of 
nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out 
using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within 3 years of the publication of the call for 
review (19th September 2019), or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are 
found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented. (See “Recommendations 
for future quality development”) 
Cinacalcet hydrochloride is packed in a clear low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag and tied using 
thread or strip. This bag is placed in a black colour LDPE bag and tied using thread or strip. This double 
polyethylene bag is placed inside a triple laminated bag. The sealed triple laminated bag is placed 
inside a HDPE container. Specifications and appropriate certificates of analysis for the primary and 
secondary packaging have been provided.  
The primary packing (LDPE bag) complies with Ph. Eur. Monograph 3.1.3 Polyolefines and with 
Commission regulation (EU) No 10/2011 as amended.

The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, 
HPLC), water content (KF), chloride content (potentiometric titration), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy 
metals (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), chiral purity (HPLC), residual solvents

(GC), triethylamine content (GC), acetic acid content (HPLC) and particle size (By Malvern 
mastersizer). 
All tested parameters are considered relevant and adequate for control of the active substance. The 
proposed tests and acceptance criteria have been established based on relevant guidelines and batch 
analysis data.  
Absence of tests identification by XRD and microbial contamination have been adequately justified. The 
proposed limits for related substances are in line with ICH Q3A (R2) (reporting threshold 0.05%, 
identification threshold 0.10%, qualification threshold 0.15%). Control of mesylated impurity was 
removed from the specification based on data demonstrating the absence of mesylated impurity in the 
active substance. Cinacalcet hydrochloride exhibits stereoisomerism, therefore a test for S-isomer 
content has been included in the specification.  
The analytical methods have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Cinacalcet hydrochloride working standard and impurity standards are routinely used in HPLC methods 
for  identification,  related  substances,  assay,  and  chiral  purity.  The  standards  have  been  well 
characterized and analysed. 
Batch analysis data for validation batches have been provided. The results are within the specifications 
and consistent from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data in accordance with ICH guidelines from process validation batches stored under long 
term condition (25±2 °C/60±5% RH) and accelerated condition (40±2 °C/75±5% RH) in the intended 
commercial package were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR, HPLC), water content (KF), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), and chiral purity (HPLC). 
Forced degradation studies have been provided to prove the specificity of HPLC methods used for 
related substances, assay and chiral purity.  
All available stability results were within the specification and no trends have been observed. 
Based on the current available stability data a retest period of 48 months is proposed and accepted for 
the active substance.

•  Cinacalcet 90 mg film-coated tablets 
Light green coloured, oval shaped, biconvex, film-coated tablets debossed with "HB3" on one side and 
plain on other side. Dimension: approximately 14.00 x 8.70 mm. 
Other ingredients are:  
-  Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, magnesium stearate 
-  Tablet coat: hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), triacetin, FD&C blue/indigo carmine 
aluminum lake (E132), iron oxide yellow (E172)  
The different strengths are fully dose proportional.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable solid oral dosage formulation that is 
bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product Mimpara film-coated tablets.  
The active substance was adequately characterized, taking into account its low solubility (class IV 
BCS). The particle size of cinacalcet hydrochloride is controlled by the finished product manufacturer as 
part of the active substance specification.  
Cinacalcet exhibits polymorphism. The active substance manufacturer has proven the consistent 
manufacturing of crystalline form I. The applicant has confirmed that the polymorphic form of the 
active substance is maintained throughout the tablet manufacturing process and during stability. 
The choice and function of the excipients has also been described, including information regarding the 
functionality related characteristics of the excipients. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph Eur, except the coating agent which is a premixture, 
but its components comply with Ph. Eur, where available. Iron oxide yellow (E172) and FD&C Blue 
#2/indigo carmine aluminum lake (E132) are not described in Ph. Eur. but they comply with 
Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. 
The results of compatibility studies of the active substance with the excipients are provided showing 
that the active substance is compatible with the selected excipients. 
Formulation development was done by a conventional approach based on the literature search and the 
characterization of reference product i.e. Mimpara 30 mg, 60mg and 90 mg film-coated tablets. The 
formulation of Cinacalcet Accord is different from the formulation of the reference product. Povidone 
and colloidal anhydrous silica are used for Mimpara but not for Cinacalcet Accordpharma. In addition 
there are differences in the composition of the film-coating and in diluents used: whereas 
microcrystalline cellulose is used as a diluent in Cinacalcet Accord, both microcrystalline cellulose and 
pregelatinised starch were used in Mimpara. These differences are not considered significant, which 
was demonstrated by comparable dissolution profiles as in the originator and performance in vivo 
(bioequivalence studies). The tablets of the different strengths are dose-proportional and 
manufactured from a common blend. 
The proposed dissolution method was adequately justified. The demonstration of the discriminative 
power of the dissolution method is considered sufficient.    
A bioequivalence study has been carried out for the highest strength 90 mg. The reference product is 
Mimpara 90 mg film-coated tablets (EU/1/04/292) marketed by Amgen Europe B.V. The reference 
product is sourced from the EU market. The test product used in the bioequivalence study has the 
same quantitative composition and is manufactured by the same process as proposed for 
commercialisation. The comparative in-vitro dissolution profile between the test and the reference 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 15/33 
 
 
 
product used in bioequivalence studies has been generated in 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and pH 
6.8 Phosphate buffer performed using a paddle stirring speed of 50 rpm and, in 0.05 N HCl performed 
using a paddle stirring speed of 75 rpm. This is in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence.  
For the additional 30 mg and 60 mg strengths a bio-waiver is claimed. All three strengths are 
qualitatively similar, quantitatively proportional and manufactured out of the same bulk granule. 
Furthermore, all three strengths are manufactured according to the same manufacturing process. 
Comparative in vitro dissolution studies between the 90 mg bio-batch versus the additional 60 mg and 
30 mg strengths were performed in 0.1N HCl, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 media using the paddle apparatus, 
showing comparable dissolutions throughout the tested pH range. For the 30 mg strength however, the 
f2 value was just near the 50 limit in one of the buffers and the lower dose level did not reach a 
plateau. To address the issue of dissolution dissimilarity for the lowest strength, which triggered a 
major objection, a comparison study with the reference medicinal product, Mimpara 30 mg vs test 
product, Cinacalcet Accordpharma 30 mg film coated tablets was conducted. Similarity between 
reference and test product was demonstrated. Additionally, the applicant showed similar profiles at the 
same dose (three tablets of 30 mg versus one tablet of 90 mg). Based on the data provided the bio-
waiver for the 30 mg and 60 mg strengths is considered justified.  
Manufacturing process development 
As the flow property of the active substance is very poor, a wet granulation technique was adopted to 
start the development trials. The manufacturing process comprised of granulation, lubrication, 
compression and coating. All these process variables might have a direct impact on quality attributes 
of the finished product so the following process parameters have been optimised during process 
development: granulation parameters, lubrication time, compression parameters and coating. 
Container closure system 
The primary packaging consists of a clear PVC/Aluminium blister (pack sizes of 14, 28 or 84 tablets) or 
a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a child-resistant polypropylene cap (pack size of 30 
tablets). The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. The materials comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements.  
The bulk pack for transportation and further re-packaging into final container closure system consists 
of a clear, transparent LDPE bag in a high molecular weight high density polyethylene (HMHDPE) 
container. Stability data and appropriate information regarding the bulk pack for transportation have 
been provided. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is considered a standard process and it consists of the following main 
steps: 
-  wet granulation  
-  pre-compression blending 
- 
- 
compression 
coating 
The manufacturing steps have been described in detail.

The applicant has confirmed that the shelf-life of the finished product will be set in accordance with the 
NfG on start of the shelf-life of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96).  
Process validation has been carried out on three consecutive commercial scale batches of Cinacalcet 30 
mg, 60 mg and 90 mg film-coated tablets. The batches were manufactured by using common 
granulation. The common granules were further divided into three parts for the compression of the 
individual strengths. The process validation report shows that the proposed process is capable of 
consistently produce finished product that meets the specifications.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this dosage form: description, 
tablet weight, identification (UV, HPLC), loss on drying (in-house), dissolution (UV), uniformity of 
dosage units (content uniformity, HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbial 
examination (Ph Eur).  
The applicant provided a discussion regarding the impurities of the finished product focusing on 
degradation products arising from the manufacturing process and those expected during storage.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
The reference standards (cinacalcet hydrochloride standards and impurity standards) used by the 
finished product manufacturer are adequately characterised.  
Batch analysis results for three validation batches of each strength of the finished product are 
presented. The batch analysis data are acceptable and indicate that all tested parameters are within 
set specifications, showing low variations and indicating the reliability of the production process. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches for each of the tablet strength of finished product 
stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches 
of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in both primary 
packaging systems (PVC-Alu blister and HDPE bottle) proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance (visual inspection), dissolution (UV), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), water content (loss of drying), and microbiological test (Ph. Eur.). The analytical 
procedures used were the same as for release. The methods for related substances and assay were 
shown to be stability indicating. 
Photostability study has been performed on one batch of cinacalcet hydrochloride 90 mg film-coated 
tablet (direct exposure) by exposure to 1.2 million lux hours and then to near UV energy of 200 watt 
hours/square meter. No out of specification results were observed. Cinacalcet hydrochloride film coated 
tablets are therefore not considered to be photosensitive. 
An in-use stability study was performed for one batch of each tablet strength stored in the HDPE 
bottle. The results showed that the finished product was stable and no trends were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020

Based on the data provided, the shelf life claim of 36 months without special storage conditions can be 
accepted for both PVC-Alu blister and HDPE bottle.  
Based on stability data provided for the bulk shipment pack (6 months at accelerated conditions (40°C 
± 2°C/75% ± 5 %RH) and 12 months at long term conditions (25°C ± 2°C/60% ± 5 %RH)), the shelf 
life claim of 12 months without special storage conditions can be accepted.  
Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in this formulation are of human or animal origin. Magnesium stearate is of 
vegetable origin. TSE-BSE free statements were provided for following excipients: microcrystalline 
cellulose, crospovidone, magnesium stearate (vegetable origin) and opadry 03K510007 green. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Three major objections relating to quality aspects were raised during the procedure.  
One major objection was raised in relation to one of the proposed starting materials. Following a 
redefinition of the starting material the major objection was considered resolved. 
Another major objection was raised in relation to the proposed limit for an impurity. The manufacturer 
presented batch analysis data, stability data and a purging study to demonstrate the absence of the 
impurity in the final active substance. The method description, typical chromatograms and validation 
report were also provided upon request and the major objection was thereby considered resolved.  
A third major objection was raised in relation to the data provided to support the biowaiver for the 30 
mg strength. To address the issue of dissolution dissimilarity for between the bio-batch and the 30 mg 
strength, a comparison study with the reference medicinal product, Mimpara 30 mg vs test product, 
Cinacalcet Accordpharma 30 mg film coated tablets was conducted. Additionally, the applicant showed 
similar profiles at the same dose (three tablets of test product of 30 mg versus one tablet of 90 mg). 
Based on the data provided the bio-waiver for the 30 mg and 60 mg strengths is considered justified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended points for investigation, including a risk evaluation on the potential presence 
of nitrosamine impurities.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride are well 
known. As Cinacalcet Hydrochloride is a widely used, well-known active substance, the Applicant has 
not provided additional studies and further studies are not required. This application is based on a 
literature overview, which is considered appropriate.  
The impurity profile has not been discussed in the non-clinical overview. For the relevance of impurities 
the reader should refer to the quality sections of this report.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the Applicant as follows: 
This product is already available as a generic product on the market. Hence, marketing authorization of 
the proposed product will not lead to any increased environmental risk. The risk assessment is based 
on the following assumptions: 
• 
• 
• 
The proposed marketing authorization will not lead to increase the use of this product. This 
would rather replace some of the product already available on the market. 
There are no additional precautionary or safety measures required for generic form, if the 
product is available on the market for more than 10 years.  
There is no specific requirement to be included in the SmPC and PIL in line with the reference 
product. 
•  Generic products are not exempted from providing an ERA according to the current guideline.  
The Applicant’s justification for not submitting ERA data (see EMA document 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1) was substantiated by suitable information. It is noted that 
according to the AR of the latest Cinacalcet PSUSA, the market exposure (in patient years) did not 
increase significantly. An additional impact of Cinacalcet Accordpharma on the environment is 
considered unlikely.   
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical sections of the SmPC of Cinacalcet Accordpharma are identical to the non-clinical 
sections of the SmPC of the reference product (Mimpara) and hence acceptable. Additionally, the 
grounds for not providing new data is justified adequately. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Cinacalcet Accordpharma from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided an overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of cinacalcet based on published literature, which is considered acceptable. The 
SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The indications, posology and method of 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 19/33 
 
 
 
administration in the proposed SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product Mimpara, 
including the paediatric indication. 
As there is no paediatric formulation available for Cinacalcet Accordpharma and exact dosing/titration 
is not possible below 30 mg, the inclusion of a respective statement in the SmPC was implemented: 
‘Note: Cinacalcet Accordpharma is only available as film-coated tablet. Thus, it is not possible to 
administer Cinacalcet Accordpharma to paediatric patients that require less than a full 30 mg dose. If 
an alternate dose is required, other cinacalcet products offering such an option should be used.’ 
The Applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. Relevant for 
the assessment are the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence ((CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev 01 – January 2010; = BE Guideline) and Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
The Applicant conducted a single bioequivalence study in which only the highest strength (90 mg 
tablets Cinacalcet Accordpharma) was evaluated. The Applicant applies for a biowaiver for the 30 mg 
and 60 mg strengths.  
Pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet has been shown to be dose-proportional between 30 and 180 mg (see 
EPAR of reference product Mimpara and literature on the matter). According to the BE guideline the 
following criteria have to be met in addition to qualify for a biowaiver: 
a) The pharmaceutical products have to be manufactured by the same manufacturing process, this 
requirement is met according to documentation provided by the Applicant. 
b) The qualitative composition of different strengths of the test product is the same and thus adequate 
to qualify for a biowaiver. 
c) the composition of the strengths is quantitatively proportional, i.e. the ratio between the amount of 
each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all strengths. 
d) appropriate in vitro dissolution data should confirm the adequacy of waiving additional in vivo 
bioequivalence testing: 
Similarity of in vitro dissolution should be demonstrated at all conditions within the applied product 
series, i.e. between additional strengths and the strength(s) (i.e. batch(es)) used for bioequivalence 
testing. 
In-vitro dissolution tests have been provided with Cinacalcet Tablets 30/60/90 mg in 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 
Acetate buffer and pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer. This is in line with what is proposed in the applicable 
guideline.  
As for no strength (30/60 or 90mg) > 85% of drug is dissolved within 15 minutes (irrespective of pH), 
further mathematical evaluation has been conducted to justify qualification for a biowaiver: 
The f2-values calculated at pH 1.2, 4.5 & 6.8 are in the range of 50 to 100 and thus in accordance with 
the respective limits of acceptability according to the BE Guideline. For the 30 mg strength at pH 6.8 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 20/33 
 
 
 
however, the f2 value is just near the 50 limit (50.4). The Applicant provided results of a comparison 
analysis with the reference medicinal product (Mimpara 30 mg) vs. the test product (Cinacalcet 30 mg 
film coated tablets) conducted at 50 rpm at pH 4.5 and pH 6.8 (see assessment in the quality part).  
RSD values were calculated and all values were less than 20% for the first point and less than 10% 
from second to last time point which is in accordance with the respective guideline. 
It is noted that the excipients for Cinacalcet Accordpharma enlisted by the Applicant are not listed in 
the Annex to the European Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the labelling and package leaflet of 
medicinal products for human use’ (SANTE-2017-11668) (EMA/CHMP/302620/2017) and hence 
considered to not be an issue. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted a single bioequivalence study. 
Table 1:  
Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
To support the application, the applicant submitted one bioequivalence study (Study/Project No. 0418-
17) which is discussed in the following sections of this report.  
Methods 
Study design  
The study was an open label, balanced, randomized, two-sequence, two-treatment, two-period, single 
oral dose, crossover, bioequivalence study of two products of Cinacalcet Tablets 90 mg in normal, 
healthy, adult, male human subjects under fed condition, with a screening period of 28 days prior to 
the dosing in Period-I. In each study period, 33 blood samples including one pre-dose blood sample 
were collected from each subject (except for the discontinued/withdrawn subjects and missing 
samples) to analyse the pharmacokinetic profile of the test as well as the reference products. 
The design of the study is in line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bio-equivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01 – January 2010) and thus considered appropriate to investigate 
bioequivalence between immediate release formulations of the test and reference products.  
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 21/33 
 
 
 
 
After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the subjects were served a standardized high fat and high 
calorie vegetarian breakfast, which they consumed within 30 minutes. A single oral dose (90 mg) of 
either the test product or the reference product was administered to the subjects at 30 minutes after 
serving the breakfast. Since the SmPC of the reference product Mimpara recommends administration 
with food, it is appropriate that the study was conducted under fed conditions. 
Considering the decline of the cinacalcet concentration in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of 
approximately 6 hours and a terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours, the washout period was more than 5 
half-lifes of the active substances’, and thus enough to avoid potential carry-over effects and in line 
with the guideline.  
The sampling period and sampling scheme seems adequate to estimate the primary PK parameters of 
cinacalcet. The sampling is frequent enough around the expected Tmax (mean ~6 hours) to sufficiently 
approximate Cmax. Considering the rather long terminal half-life of cinacalcet, it is considered 
acceptable to collect blood samples until 192 hours post-dose to calculate the AUC. The majority of the 
subject’s samples at 192 hours post-dose were below the Limit of Quantification Quality Control (LOQ 
QC, 0.261 ng/mL). The AUC(0-t) seems to easily cover over 80% of the AUC(0-∞). 
According to the Applicant, the major circulating metabolites are inactive and thus considered not an 
issue. They have not been evaluated separately in the experiment. The SmPC of the Originator 
Mimpara does not mention relevant metabolites. 
A block-randomization scheme was used (block size of two).  
Test and reference products  
The choice of reference product is appropriate.  
The batch size of the test product applied in the bioequivalence study is in accordance with the BE 
Guideline where a production scale above 100,000 is recommended. Certificates of analysis have not 
been provided, however since only one batch was used for either test or reference product this seems 
acceptable. 
In contrast to the reference product Mimpara, the test product Cinacalcet Accordpharma does not 
include Lactose. Therefore, the excipient warning as outlines in the Excipients guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/302620/2017) does not apply here and has been deleted from the product information. 
According to the Applicant the formulation of the test product batch used in the BE study is identical to 
the formulation of the batches for the market. 
Population(s) studied   
Subjects participated in the study were non-smokers, normal, healthy, adult, male human volunteers 
between 18 to 45 years of age (both inclusive), having a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 to 30.0 
kg/m2 (both inclusive), were able to understand and comply with the study procedures and given their 
written informed consent were checked in for the study. They did not have any significant diseases or 
clinically significant abnormal findings during screening, medical history, clinical examination, 
laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECG and chest X-ray (posterior-anterior view) recordings. Subjects had 
clinically acceptable values for tests of serum calcium, serum phosphorus and iPTH at the time of 
screening. The inclusion and exclusion criteria have been adequately described and seem acceptable.

Table 2: 
Demographics 
No female volunteers were enrolled in the study. According to the BE guideline, the subjects could belong 
to either sex; however, the risk to women of childbearing potential should be considered. A subgroup 
analysis  by  age,  sex,  race  and  geographic  region  showed  no  differences  in  the  magnitude  of  the 
treatment effect of cinacalcet across subgroups (see EMA EPAR Mimpara 2005). Hence, the inclusion of 
only male subjects is acceptable. 
The criteria for restrictions, concomitant medication, subject screening and examination, investigations 
and post study procedures seem to be adequately defined. 
As per the protocol, the subjects were instructed not to take any medicine [prescribed and over the 
counter (OTC) medication including herbal remedies, CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole)] at any time within 14 days prior to the drug administration in Period-I until completion 
of the study (i.e. until the last pharmacokinetic sample of Period-II). Any such subjects could have 
been removed from the study.  
Patient disposition 
A  total  of  73  subjects  including  three  additional  subjects  were  checked  in  for  the  study.  They  were 
checked in for the study in order to compensate for any dropout prior to dosing in Period-I. According to 
the Applicant, one of these additional subjects was checked out of the facility prior to dosing in Period-I 
as no more subject discontinued/was withdrawn from the study and he was not needed. As this subject 
has not been dosed within the study, this approach seems acceptable.

Determination of sample size 
Based on the applicant’s in-house study data, the maximum intra-subject variability observed for 
primary pharmacokinetic parameter was found to be approximately 25%; the sample size computation 
was determined using SAS by considering the following assumptions: T/R ratio = 90.0-110.0%, intra-
subject coefficient of variation (%) approximately 25%, significance level 5%, power ≥ 80% and 
bioequivalence limits 80.00-125.00%.  
Based on the above estimates, a sample size of 56 subjects was required to establish bioequivalence 
between formulations with adequate power. Considering approximately 20% drop-outs and/or 
withdrawals, a sample size of 70 subjects was sufficient to establish bioequivalence between 
formulations with adequate power for this pivotal study. 
Determination of sample size is rather conservative and acceptable. 
Analytical methods   
The plasma concentrations of the analyte Cinacalcet in the subject samples were determined by a 
validated LC-MS/MS method. The analyte and internal standard were extracted from a 0.250 mL 
aliquot of K2EDTA (Dipotassium Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetate) human plasma using liquid-liquid 
extraction method. The extracted samples were injected into a liquid chromatograph. 
The detection method used was tandem mass spectrometry detector. Quantitation is determined by 
peak area ratio method. A weighted (1/c2) linear regression is performed to determine the 
concentration of the analytes. 
The validation of the analytical methods was adequately explained and is acceptable  
The analytical method for the determination of Cinacalcet in K2EDTA human plasma as well as 
respective validations (including partial validations) are described adequately; the validation including 
two annexes was performed according to the requirements of the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical 
method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). Acceptance criteria are in a plausible range and 
are fulfilled. 
The bioanalytical method demonstrates acceptable performance and is suitable for the determination 
of Cinacalcet in K2EDTA human plasma over the calibration range. 
All chromatograms of all subjects have been provided. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters were Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. 
The secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were Tmax, λz, t½ and AUC_%Extrap_obs. These 
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for Cinacalcet by using non-compartmental model of 
Phoenix® WinNonlin® Version 6.4 software (Certara L.P.). 
The chosen (primary and secondary) parameters and the software used seem adequate.  
In addition, the AUC(0-t) and the sampling time (last sample taken 192 hours after dosing) is 
considered adequate as 80% of the AUC0-∞ are apparently covered.  
Statistical methods   
The following parameters were pre-specified: 
Assessment report  
EMA/92635/2020  
Page 24/33 
 
 
 
• T/R ratio = 90.0-110.0% 
• Intra-Subject C.V (%) ~ 25% 
• Significance Level = 5% 
• Power ≥ 80% 
• Bioequivalence Limits = 80.00 - 125.00% 
Descriptive statistics were computed and reported for the pharmacokinetic parameters for Cinacalcet. 
As the study was conducted in groups, ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞ from all the groups were to be subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for Cinacalcet. The 
ANOVA model included Group, Sequence, Sequence*Group, Subject (Sequence*Group), Period 
(Group) and Formulation effects. Each analysis of variance included the calculation of least-squares 
mean values, the difference between the adjusted formulation mean values and the standard error 
associated with the differences. If the number of subjects for BE-evaluation was <5 subjects in any 
group, then that group was combined to another group. 
According to the BE Guideline, the ANOVA model is acceptable for analysis of logarithmically 
transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC. In addition, the pre-specified parameter are in 
line with the Guideline. 
An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at 
a significance level of 5% (alpha=0.05).  
The power of the single BE-study was computed and reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Cinacalcet.  
Ratio of geometric least squares mean values of the test and reference formulations was computed and 
reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Cinacalcet.  
Intra-subject variability was computed and reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Cinacalcet.  
Using two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric least 
squares mean values between drug formulations were computed for ln-transformed data of Cmax, AUC0-
t and AUC0-∞ for Cinacalcet. 
There were no Bioanalytical Protocol deviations during subject sample analysis. 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, “subjects in a crossover trial who do 
not provide evaluable data for both of the test and reference products (or who fail to provide evaluable 
data for the single period in a parallel group trial) should not be included”. However, in the study 
report, the Applicant used and included data from subjects who failed to provide such data. The 
Applicant provided re-calculated data without the results from these subjects as requested and only 
these data are presented below. Aberrations to the results initially provided are marginal and do not 
change the outcome of the BE exercise.

ANOVA p-values for Cinacalcet 
The pharmacokinetic parameter data including confidence intervals and point estimates presented by 
the Applicant in table 4-6 are well in line with the acceptance criteria set in the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr – revised 2010) and support 
the notion of bioequivalence between the reference and test product. This is supported by the p-values 
calculated in table 7.

The 90% confidence interval for the ln-transformed values for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞) and Cmax were within 
the 80.00-125% limit and are thus considered acceptable. 
The SD seems rather high (and the CV% rather low) which likely reflects a high inter-individual - and a 
low intra-individual variability. This is seen for both, the test- and the reference product. It is unknown 
whether SD could also be influenced by the observed sequence effect in ln Cmax: 
Statistical analysis was performed with the samples of totally 60 subjects.  
Cmax was not observed in any subject in the first sample time point (=pre-dose), which is reassuring.  
Safety data 
According to the Applicant, safety was assessed from the screening period to the end of the study. It 
was assessed through clinical examination, vital signs assessment, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), 
chest X-ray (posterior-anterior view) recording, clinical laboratory parameters [e.g. biochemistry 
(including serum calcium and serum phosphorus), haematology, immunology (including iPTH) and 
urine analysis], subjective symptomatology and monitoring of adverse events. Monitoring practices 
seem adequate.

Nine (9) adverse events (AEs) were reported by nine (9) subjects during the conduct of the study. The 
Applicant states that four (4) AEs were reported in Period-I, four (4) AEs were reported in Period-II 
and one (1) AE was reported during post-study safety assessment.  
According to the Applicant, all the AEs were mild in nature and all the subjects were followed up until 
resolution of their AEs.  
There were no deaths or serious AEs reported during the conduct of the study.  
Out of the total reported nine (9) AEs, one (1) AE was significant. Subject (No. 1070) had a single 
episode of vomiting during a high fat high calorie vegetarian breakfast prior to dosing in Period-II and 
was thus withdrawn from the study on medical grounds. He was treated appropriately and followed up 
until resolution of his AE. The causality assessment was judged as unlikely related for this AE.  
According to the Applicant, seven (7) AEs were reported after administration of test-product and two 
(2) AEs were reported after administration of reference-product, indicating a slight imbalance between 
the arms. Of the 7 AEs in the test-product group, 5 were ‘vomiting’ (4 of them possibly related), one 
was ‘pyrexia’ and one was ‘blood creatinine increase’ (both unrelated), whereas the 2 AEs in the 
reference-product group were ‘vomiting’ (both considered possibly related).  
Due to the small sample sizes of the two compared groups and the overall small number of events, the 
impact of the factor ‘product’ on the frequency of AEs cannot be definitively assessed. Taking into 
account the causality assessment of the AEs and the similarity of the products in terms of qualitative 
and quantitative composition, a clinically relevant difference seems unlikely, however.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetic Conclusion   
The bioequivalence study appears to have been well conducted. Based on the presented 
bioequivalence study Cinacalcet Accordpharma is considered bioequivalent with Cinacalcet Mimpara. 
The results of the study can be extrapolated to other strengths, according to conditions in the 
Guidelines. 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.5.  Post-marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
The originator has been licensed in 2004 and several generic products are on the marked. 
In general, adverse reactions observed in clinical practice are concordant with the safety profile of the 
drug in the clinical studies. In addition to nausea and vomiting, the following adverse reactions have 
been identified during post-marketing use of cinacalcet, the frequencies of which cannot be estimated 
from available data; There have been reports of isolated, idiosyncratic cases of hypotension and/or 
worsening heart failure in cinacalcet-treated patients with impaired cardiac function in postmarketing 
safety surveillance, cases of allergic reactions, including angioedema and urticaria as well as QT 
prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcaemia.

2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support this application, the Applicant submitted the data of one open label, balanced, randomized, 
two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single oral dose, crossover, bioequivalence study (Study 
No. 0418-17) of two products of Cinacalcet Tablets 90 mg (Test product: Cinacalcet Accordpharma 
90mg tablets and Reference product: Mimpara 90 mg film-coated tablets) in normal, healthy, adult, 
human subjects under fed conditions. 73 subjects were checked in for the study and the data of 60 
subjects were analysed. The parameters for evaluation of bioequivalence are considered adequate. The 
results of this study, namely AUC(0-t) (point estimate: 100.2, CI: 95.52 - 105.15), AUC(0-∞) (point 
estimate: 100.4, CI: 95.86 - 105.18) and Cmax (point estimate: 98.6, CI: 92.55 - 105.15), well support 
the notion of bioequivalence between the test and the reference product.  
Overall, the study seems to be well conducted and straight forward. The design of the single 
bioequivalence study is in line with the regulatory guidance and considered appropriate. The grounds 
to justify the biowaiver for the 30 mg and 60 mg seem to be in accordance with the Guideline. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The bioequivalence study appears to have been well conducted and the results of the single 
bioequivalence study support bioequivalence between the reference product Mimpara and the test 
product Cinacalcet Accordpharma.

Posology 
Asthma 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is not intended for the initial management of asthma.  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is not an appropriate treatment for the adult patient with only 
mild asthma who is not adequately controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid and “as needed” inhaled short-
acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonists.  
The dosage of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is individual and should be adjusted to the severity 
of the disease.  This should be considered not only when treatment with combination medicinal products is 
initiated but also when the maintenance dose is adjusted.  If an individual patient should require a 
combination of doses other than those available in the combination inhaler, appropriate doses of β2 
adrenoceptor agonists and/or corticosteroids by individual inhalers should be prescribed. 
Once asthma symptoms are controlled, consideration may be given to gradually reducing the dose of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. Patients should be reassessed regularly by their prescriber/health 
care provider so that the dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. remains optimal. The dose 
should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.  
When it is appropriate to titrate down to a lower strength than is available for Budesonide/Formoterol Teva 
Pharma B.V., a change to an alternative fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
containing a lower dose of the inhaled corticosteroid is required. When long-term control of symptoms is 
maintained with the lowest recommended dose, then the next step could include a test of inhaled 
corticosteroid alone.  
In usual practice when control of symptoms is achieved with the twice daily dose regimen with a lower 
strength product, titration to a lower effective dose could include once daily dosing when, in the opinion of 
the prescriber, a long-acting bronchodilator is required to maintain control rather than treatment with an 
inhaled corticosteroid alone. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is taken as regular maintenance treatment with a separate rapid-
acting bronchodilator reliever inhaler.   
Patients should be advised to have their separate rapid-acting bronchodilator reliever inhaler available for 
rescue use at all times. 
Recommended doses: 
Adults (18 years and older):  1-2 inhalations twice daily.  Some patients may require up to a maximum of 4 
inhalations twice daily. 
Increasing use of a separate rapid-acting bronchodilator indicates a worsening of the underlying condition 
and warrants a reassessment of the asthma therapy. 
Special populations: 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
There are no special dosing requirements for elderly patients.   
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
There are no data available for use of a fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  As budesonide and formoterol are primarily 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eliminated via hepatic metabolism, an increased exposure can be expected in patients with severe liver 
cirrhosis. 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. in children, 12 years and younger and 
adolescents, 13 to 17 years of age has not yet been established. No data are available.  
This medicinal product is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. 
Method of administration 
Inhalation use. 
Spiromax is a breath actuated, inspiratory flow-driven inhaler, which means that the active substances are 
delivered into the airways when the patient inhales through the mouthpiece. Moderate and severe asthmatic 
patients were shown to be able to generate sufficient inspiratory flow rate for Spiromax to deliver the 
therapeutic dose (see section 5.1).  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. should be used correctly in order to achieve effective treatment. 
As such, the patients should be advised to read the patient information leaflet carefully and follow the 
instructions for use as detailed in the leaflet.  
The use of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. follows three simple steps: open, breathe and close 
which are outlined below. 
Open:  Hold the Spiromax with the mouthpiece cover at the bottom and open the mouthpiece cover by 
folding it down until it is fully opened when one click is heard. 
Breathe: Place the mouthpiece between the teeth with the lips closed around the mouthpiece, do not bite the 
mouthpiece of the inhaler. Breathe in forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece. Remove the Spiromax 
from mouth and hold the breath for 10 seconds or as long as comfortable for the patients. 
Close: Breathe out gently and close the mouthpiece cover. 
It is also important to advise patients not to shake the inhaler before use and not to breathe out through the 
Spiromax and not to block the air vents when they are preparing the “Breathe” step.  
Patients should also be advised to rinse their mouth with water after inhaling (see section 4.4) 
The patient may notice a taste when using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. due to the lactose 
excipient. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or the excipient listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
It is recommended that the dose is tapered when the treatment is discontinued and should not be stopped 
abruptly.

If patients find the treatment ineffective, or exceed the highest recommended dose of Budesonide/Formoterol 
Teva Pharma B.V., medical attention must be sought (see section 4.2). Sudden and progressive deterioration 
in control of asthma is potentially life-threatening and the patient should undergo urgent medical assessment.  
In this situation, consideration should be given to the need for increased therapy with corticosteroids, e.g. a 
course of oral corticosteroids, or antibiotic treatment if an infection is present. 
Patients should be advised to have their rescue inhaler available at all times.  
Patients should be reminded to take their Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. maintenance dose as 
prescribed, even when asymptomatic.   
The prophylactic use of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V., e.g. before exercise, has not been 
studied.  A separate rapid-acting bronchodilator should be considered for such prophylactic use . 
Asthma symptoms 
Patients should be reassessed regularly by their prescriber/healthcare provider so that the dose of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. remains optimal.  The dose should be titrated to the lowest dose 
at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.  Once asthma symptoms are controlled, consideration 
may be given to gradually reducing the dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.  When it is 
appropriate to titrate down to a lower strength than is available for Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma 
B.V., a change to an alternative fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate containing a 
lower dose of the inhaled corticosteroid is required. 
Regular review of patients as treatment is stepped down is important.  
Patients should not be initiated on Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. during an exacerbation, or if 
they have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma.  
Serious asthma-related adverse reactions and exacerbations may occur during treatment with 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek 
medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation with 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath, after 
dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchopasm Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and an alternative therapy instituted, if 
necessary. Paradoxical bronchopasm responds to a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated 
straightaway (see section 4.8). 
Systemic effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long 
periods.  These effects are much less likely to occur with inhalation treatment than with oral corticosteroids.  
Possible systemic effects include Cushing´s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth 
retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma and more 
rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, 
anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children)  (see section 4.8). 
It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is 
regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of 
inhaled corticosteroid to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained, if possible. The 
benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. 
In addition consideration should be given to  referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Limited data from long-term studies suggest that most children and adolescents treated with inhaled 
budesonide will ultimately achieve their adult target height. However, an initial small but transient reduction 
in growth (approximately 1 cm) has been observed. This generally occurs within the first year of treatment. 
Effects on bone density 
Potential effects on bone density should be considered, particularly in patients on high doses for prolonged 
periods that have co-existing risk factors for osteoporosis.  
Long-term studies with inhaled budesonide in children at mean daily doses of 400 micrograms (metered 
dose) or in adults at daily doses of 800 micrograms (metered dose) have not shown any significant effects on 
bone mineral density. No information regarding the effect of a  budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
fixed-dose combination at higher doses is available. 
Adrenal function 
If there is any reason to suppose that adrenal function is impaired from previous systemic steroid therapy, 
care should be taken when transferring patients to a budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed-dose combination 
therapy.  
The benefits of inhaled budesonide therapy would normally minimise the need for oral steroids, but patients 
transferring from oral steroids may remain at risk of impaired adrenal reserve for a considerable time. 
Recovery may take a considerable amount of time after cessation of oral steroid therapy and hence oral 
steroid-dependent patients transferred to inhaled budesonide may remain at risk from impaired adrenal 
function for some considerable time. In such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) 
axis function should be monitored regularly. 
High dose corticosteroids 
The prolonged treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly higher than recommended 
doses, may also result in clinically significant adrenal suppression. Therefore additional systemic 
corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress such as severe infections or elective 
surgery. Rapid reduction in the dose of steroids can induce acute adrenal crisis. Symptoms and signs which 
might be seen in acute adrenal crisis may be somewhat vague but may include anorexia, abdominal pain, 
weight loss, tiredness, headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, hypotension 
and hypoglycaemia. 
Treatment with supplementary systematic steroids or inhaled budesonide should not be stopped abruptly. 
Transfer from oral therapy 
During transfer from oral therapy to a budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed-dose combination therapy, a 
generally lower systemic steroid action will be experienced which may result in the appearance of allergic or 
arthritic symptoms such as rhinitis, eczema and muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment should be initiated 
for these conditions. A general insufficient glucocorticosteroid effect should be suspected if, in rare cases, 
symptoms such as tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting should occur. In these cases a temporary 
increase in the dose of oral glucocorticosteroids is sometimes necessary. 
Oral infections 
To minimise the risk of oropharyngeal candida infection, the patient should be instructed to rinse their mouth 
out with water after inhaling the dose.  If oropharyngeal thrush occurs, patients should also rinse their mouth 
with water after the as-needed inhalations.

Interaction with other medicinal products 
Concomitant treatment with itraconazole, ritonavir or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided 
(see section 4.5).  If this is not possible the time interval between administrations of the interacting medicinal 
products should be as long as possible.  In patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, a budesonide/formoterol 
fumarate fixed-dose combination is not recommended. 
Caution with special diseases 
A fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should be administered with 
caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus, untreated hypokalaemia, 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic subvalvular aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, 
aneurysm or other severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmias or 
severe heart failure. 
Caution should be observed when treating patients with prolongation of the QTc-interval. Formoterol itself 
may induce prolongation of the QTc-interval. 
The need for, and dose of inhaled corticosteroids should be re-evaluated in patients with active or quiescent 
pulmonary tuberculosis, fungal and viral infections in the airways. 
Additional blood glucose controls should be considered in diabetic patients. 
β2 adrenoreceptor agonists 
Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from high doses of β2 adrenoceptor agonists.  Concomitant 
treatment of β2 adrenoceptor agonists with medicinal products which can induce hypokalaemia or potentiate 
a hypokalaemic effect, e.g. xanthine-derivatives, steroids and diuretics, may add to a possible hypokalaemic 
effect of the β2 adrenoceptor agonist.   
Treatment with β2 adrenoceptor agonists may result in an increase in blood levels of insulin, free fatty acids, 
glycerol and ketone bodies. 
Particular caution is recommended in unstable asthma with variable use of rescue bronchodilators, in acute 
severe asthma as the associated risk may be augmented by hypoxia and in other conditions when the 
likelihood for hypokalaemia is increased.  It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored 
during these circumstances. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the 
Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The excipient 
lactose contains small amounts of milk proteins which may cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, nefazodone and HIV protease inhibitors) are likely to markedly increase plasma levels of 
budesonide and concomitant use should be avoided. If this is not possible the time interval between 
administration of the inhibitor and budesonide should be as long as possible (see section 4.4).  
The potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, 200 mg once daily, increased plasma levels of concomitantly 
orally administered budesonide (single dose 3 mg) on average six-fold. When ketoconazole was 
administered 12 hours after budesonide the concentration was on average increased only three-fold showing 
that separation of the administration times can reduce the increase in plasma levels. Limited data about this 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interaction for high-dose inhaled budesonide indicates that marked increases in plasma levels (on average 
four fold) may occur if itraconazole, 200 mg once daily, is administered concomitantly with inhaled 
budesonide (single dose of 1000 micrograms). 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
β adrenergic blockers can weaken or inhibit the effect of formoterol. A fixed-dose combination therapy of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should therefore not be given together with β adrenergic 
blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons. 
Concomitant treatment with quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, phenothiazines, antihistamines 
(terfenadine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants can prolong the QTc-interval and 
increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.  
In addition L-Dopa, L-thyroxine, oxytocin and alcohol can impair cardiac tolerance towards β2 
sympathomimetics. 
Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors including medicinal products with similar 
properties such as furazolidone and procarbazine may precipitate hypertensive reactions. 
There is an elevated risk of arrhythmias in patients receiving concomitant anaesthesia with halogenated 
hydrocarbons. 
Concomitant use of other   β adrenergic medicinal products and anticholinergic medicinal products can have 
a potentially additive bronchodilating effect. 
Hypokalaemia may increase the disposition towards arrhythmias in patients who are treated with digitalis 
glycosides. 
Budesonide and formoterol have not been observed to interact with any other medicinal products used in the 
treatment of asthma. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For a fixed-dose combination therapy of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate or the concomitant 
treatment with formoterol and budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.  Data from 
an embryo-fetal development study in the rat, showed no evidence of any additional effect from the 
combination. 
There are no adequate data from use of formoterol in pregnant women.  In animal studies formoterol has 
caused adverse reactions in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels (see section 5.3). 
Data on approximately 2000 exposed pregnancies indicate no increased teratogenic risk associated with the 
use of inhaled budesonide.  In animal studies glucocorticosteroids have been shown to induce malformations 
(see section 5.3).  This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended doses. 
Animal studies have also identified an involvement of excess prenatal glucocorticoids in increased risks for 
intrauterine growth retardation, adult cardiovascular disease and permanent changes in glucocorticoid 
receptor density, neurotransmitter turnover and behaviour at exposures below the teratogenic dose range.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During pregnancy, a fixed-dose combination therapy of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
should only be used when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  The lowest effective dose of budesonide 
needed to maintain adequate asthma control should be used. 
Breast-feeding 
Budesonide is excreted in breast milk.  However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are 
anticipated.  It is not known whether formoterol passes into human breast milk.  In rats, small amounts of 
formoterol have been detected in maternal milk.  Administration of a fixed-dose combination therapy of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate  to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered 
if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child. 
Fertility 
No data on fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Since Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. contains both budesonide and formoterol, the same pattern 
of adverse reactions as reported for these substances may occur.  No increased incidence of adverse reactions 
has  been  seen  following  concurrent  administration  of  the  two  compounds.    The  most  common  adverse 
reactions  are  pharmacologically  predictable  adverse  reactions  of  β2  adrenoceptor  agonist  therapy,  such  as 
tremor and palpitations.  These tend to be mild and usually disappear within a few days of treatment.   
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is not indicated in children and adolescents under the age of 18 
years (see section 4.2). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions, which have been associated with budesonide or formoterol, are given below and listed by

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Candida infection in the oropharynx is due to active substance deposition. Advising the patient to rinse the 
mouth  out  with  water  after  each  dose  will  minimise  the  risk.  Oropharyngeal  Candida  infection  usually 
responds to topical anti-fungal treatment without the need to discontinue the inhaled corticosteroid. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur very rarely, affecting less than 1 in 10,000 people, with an immediate 
increase  in  wheezing  and  shortness  of  breath  after  dosing.  Paradoxical  bronchopasm  responds  to  a  rapid-
acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated straightaway. Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and an alternative therapy is instituted if 
necessary (see section 4.4). 
Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods.  
These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include 
Cushing´s  syndrome,  Cushingoid  features,  adrenal  suppression,  growth  retardation  in  children  and 
adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Increased susceptibility to infections 
and  impairment  of  the  ability  to  adapt  to  stress  may  also  occur.  Effects  are  probably  dependent  on  dose, 
exposure time, concomitant and previous steroid exposure and individual sensitivity. 
Treatment with β2 adrenoceptor agonists may result in an increase in blood levels of insulin, free fatty acids, 
glycerol and ketone bodies.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose of formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for β2 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, 
headache, palpitations.  Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, 
hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting.  Supportive and symptomatic 
treatment may be indicated.  A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute 
bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute overdose with budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem.  When 
used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal 
suppression, may appear. 
If Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. therapy has to be withdrawn due to overdose of the formoterol 
component of the medicinal product, provision of appropriate inhaled corticosteroid therapy must be 
considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics and other drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases. 
ATC code: R03AK07 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. contains formoterol and budesonide, which have different modes 
of action and show additive effects in terms of reduction of asthma exacerbations.  The specific properties of 
budesonide and formoterol allow the combination to be used as maintenance treatment of asthma.  The 
mechanisms of action of the two substances respectively are discussed below. 
Budesonide 
Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in 
the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations.  Inhaled budesonide has less 
severe adverse reactions than systemic corticosteroids.  The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-
inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. 
Formoterol 
Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting 
relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction.  The bronchodilating 
effect is dose-dependant, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes.  The duration of effect is at least 12 
hours after a single dose. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Asthma  
Budesonide/formoterol maintenance therapy 
Clinical studies in adults have shown that the addition of formoterol to budesonide improved asthma 
symptoms and lung function, and reduced exacerbations.   
In two 12-week studies the effect on lung function of budesonide/formoterol was equal to that of the free 
combination of budesonide and formoterol, and exceeded that of budesonide alone.  All treatment arms used 
a short-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist as needed.  There was no sign of attenuation of the anti-asthmatic 
effect over time. 
Two 12-week paediatric studies have been performed in which 265 children aged 6-11 years were treated 
with a maintenance dose of budesonide/formoterol (2 inhalations of 80 micrograms /4.5 micrograms 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
/inhalation twice daily), and a short acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist as needed. In both studies, lung function 
was improved and the treatment was well tolerated compared to the corresponding dose of budesonide alone. 
Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate through the Spiromax Device 
A randomised, open-label placebo study was performed in children and adolescents with asthma (aged 6-17 
years), adults with asthma (aged 18-45 years), and healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) to evaluate the peak 
inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) and other related inhalation parameters following inhalation from a Spiromax 
device (containing placebo) compared with inhalation from an already marketed multi-dose dry powder 
inhaler device (containing placebo). The impact of enhanced training in dry powder inhaler inhalation 
technique on inhalation speed and volume was also assessed in these subject groups. The data from the study 
indicated that regardless of age and underlying disease severity, children, adolescents and adults with asthma 
were able to able to achieve inspiratory flow rates through the Spiromax device that were similar to those 
generated through the marketed multi-dose dry powder inhaler device. The mean PIFR achieved by patients 
with asthma was over 60L/min, a flow rate at which both devices studied are known to deliver comparable 
amounts of drug to the lungs. Very few patients had PIFRs below 40L/min; when PIFRs were less than 
40L/min there appeared to be no clustering by age or disease severity. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol, and the corresponding monoproducts have been 
shown to be bioequivalent with regard to systemic exposure of budesonide and formoterol, respectively.  In 
spite of this, a small increase in cortisol suppression was seen after administration of fixed-dose combination 
compared to the monoproducts.  The difference is considered not to have an impact on clinical safety. 
There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interactions between budesonide and formoterol. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for the respective substances were comparable after the administration of 
budesonide and formoterol as monoproducts or as the fixed-dose combination.  For budesonide, AUC was 
slightly higher, rate of absorption more rapid and maximal plasma concentration higher after administration 
of the fixed combination.  For formoterol, maximal plasma concentration was similar after administration of 
the fixed combination. Inhaled budesonide is rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is 
reached within 30 minutes after inhalation.  In studies, mean lung deposition of budesonide after inhalation 
via the powder inhaler ranged from 32% to 44% of the delivered dose.  The systemic bioavailability is 
approximately 49% of the delivered dose.  In children 6-16 years of age the lung deposition falls in the same 
range as in adults for the same given dose. The resulting plasma concentrations were not determined. 
Inhaled formoterol is rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is reached within 10 minutes 
after inhalation.  In studies the mean lung deposition of formoterol after inhalation via the powder inhaler 
ranged from 28% to 49% of the delivered dose.  The systemic bioavailability is about 61% of the delivered 
dose.  
Distribution  
Plasma protein binding is approximately 50% for formoterol and 90% for budesonide.  Volume of 
distribution is about 4 L/kg for formoterol and 3 L/kg for budesonide.  Formoterol is inactivated via 
conjugation reactions (active O-demethylated and deformylated metabolites are formed, but they are seen 
mainly as inactivated conjugates).  Budesonide undergoes an extensive degree (approximately 90%) of 
biotransformation on first passage through the liver to metabolites of low glucocorticosteroid activity.  The 
glucocorticosteroid activity of the major metabolites, 6-beta-hydroxy-budesonide and 16-alfa-hydroxy-
prednisolone, is less than 1% of that of budesonide.  There are no indications of any metabolic interactions or 
any displacement reactions between formoterol and budesonide. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
The major part of a dose of formoterol is transformed by liver metabolism followed by renal elimination.  
After inhalation, 8% to 13% of the delivered dose of formoterol is excreted unmetabolised in the urine.  
Formoterol has a high systemic clearance (approximately 1.4 L/min) and the terminal elimination half-life 
averages 17 hours. 
Budesonide is eliminated via metabolism mainly catalysed by the enzyme CYP3A4.  The metabolites of 
budesonide are eliminated in urine as such or in conjugated form.  Only negligible amounts of unchanged 
budesonide have been detected in the urine.  Budesonide has a high systemic clearance (approximately 1.2 
L/min) and the plasma elimination half-life after i.v. dosing averages 4 hours. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
The pharmacokinetics of budesonide or formoterol in children and patients with renal failure are unknown.  
The exposure of budesonide and formoterol may be increased in patients with liver disease. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. pharmacokinetic profile 
In pharmacokinetic studies with and without a charcoal blockage, Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
was evaluated by comparing it with an alternative authorised fixed-dose combination inhaled product 
containing the same active substances, budesonide and formoterol and has been shown to be equivalent in 
both systemic exposure (safety) and pulmonary deposition (efficacy). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The toxicity observed in animal studies with budesonide and formoterol, given in combination or separately, 
were effects associated with exaggerated pharmacological activity. 
In animal reproduction studies, corticosteroids such as budesonide have been shown to induce malformations 
(cleft palate, skeletal malformations).  However, these animal experimental results do not seem to be relevant 
in humans at the recommended doses.  Animal reproduction studies with formoterol have shown a somewhat 
reduced fertility in male rats at high systemic exposure and implantation losses as well as decreased early 
postnatal survival and birth weight at considerably higher systemic exposures than those reached during 
clinical use.  However, these animal experimental results do not seem to be relevant in humans.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated in adults 18 years of age and older only.  
Asthma 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma, where use of a 
combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist) is appropriate: 
- in patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting β2 
adrenoceptor agonists. 
or 
- in patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 adrenoceptor 
agonists. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.is indicated in adults 18 years of age and older only.  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.is not indicated for use in children, 12 years of age and younger or 
adolescents, 13 to 17 years of age.

Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is not intended for the initial management of asthma. 
Budesonide/Formoterol  Teva  Pharma  B.V.  is  not  an  appropriate  treatment  for  the  adult  patient  with  only 
mild asthma who is not adequately controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid and “as needed” inhaled short-
acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonists.   
The dosage of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is individual and should be adjusted to the severity 
of the disease.  This should be considered not only when treatment with combination medicinal products is 
initiated  but  also  when  the  maintenance  dose  is  adjusted.    If  an  individual  patient  should  require  a 
combination  of  doses  other  than  those  available  in  the  combination  inhaler,  appropriate  doses  of  β2 
adrenoceptor agonists and/or corticosteroids by individual inhalers should be prescribed. 
Once asthma symptoms are controlled, consideration may be given to gradually reducing the dose of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.  Patients should be reassessed regularly by their prescriber/health 
care provider so that the dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. remains optimal. The dose 
should be titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.  
When it is appropriate to titrate down to a lower strength than is available for Budesonide/Formoterol Teva 
Pharma  B.V.,  a  change  to  an  alternative  fixed–dose  combination  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate 
containing  a  lower  dose  of  the  inhaled  corticosteroid  is  required.  When  long-term  control  of  symptoms  is 
maintained  with  the  lowest  recommended  dose,  then  the  next  step  could  include  a  test  of  inhaled 
corticosteroid alone. 
In  usual  practice  when  control  of  symptoms  is  achieved  with  the  twice  daily  dose  regimen  with  a  lower 
strength product, titration to a lower effective dose could include once daily dosing when, in the opinion of 
the  prescriber,  a  long-acting  bronchodilator  is  required  to  maintain  control  rather  than  treatment  with  an 
inhaled corticosteroid alone. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is taken as regular maintenance treatment with a separate rapid-
acting bronchodilator reliever inhaler.   
Patients  should  be  advised  to  have  their  separate  rapid-acting  bronchodilator  reliever  inhaler  available  for 
rescue use at all times. 
Recommended doses:  
Adults  (18  years  and  older):  1  inhalation  twice  daily.    Some  patients  may  require  up  to  a  maximum  of  2 
inhalations twice daily. 
Increasing  use  of  a  separate  rapid-acting  bronchodilator  indicates  a  worsening  of  the  underlying  condition 
and warrants a reassessment of the asthma therapy. 
Budesonide/Formoterol  Teva  Pharma  B.V.320 micrograms/9 micrograms  should  be  used  as  maintenance 
therapy only.   
Special populations: 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
There are no special dosing requirements for elderly patients.   
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
There  are  no  data  available  for  use  of  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate 
dihydrate  in  patients  with  hepatic  or  renal  impairment.    As  budesonide  and  formoterol  are  primarily 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eliminated  via  hepatic  metabolism,  an  increased  exposure  can  be  expected  in  patients  with  severe  liver 
cirrhosis. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. in children, 12 years and younger and 
adolescents, 13 to 17 years of age has not yet been established. No data are available.  
This medicinal product is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. 
Method of administration 
Inhalation use. 
Spiromax  is a  breath actuated, inspiratory  flow-driven  inhaler,  which  means  that  the  active  substances  are 
delivered into the airways when the patient inhales through the mouthpiece. Moderate and severe asthmatic 
patients  were  shown  to  be  able  to  generate  sufficient  inspiratory  flow  rate  for  Spiromax  to  deliver  the 
therapeutic dose (see section 5.1).  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. should be used correctly in order to achieve effective treatment. 
As  such,  the  patients  should  be  advised  to  read  the  patient  information  leaflet  carefully  and  follow  the 
instructions for use as detailed in the leaflet.  
The  use  of  Budesonide/Formoterol Teva  Pharma  B.V.  follows  three  simple  steps:  open,  breathe  and close 
which are outlined below. 
Open:    Hold  the  Spiromax  with  the  mouthpiece  cover  at  the  bottom  and  open  the  mouthpiece  cover  by 
folding it down until it is fully opened when one click is heard. 
Breathe: Place the mouthpiece between the teeth with the lips closed around the mouthpiece, do not bite the 
mouthpiece of the inhaler. Breathe in forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece. Remove the Spiromax 
from mouth and hold the breath for 10 seconds or as long as comfortable for the patients. 
Close: Breathe out gently and close the mouthpiece cover 
It is also important to advise patients not to shake the inhaler before use and not to breathe out through the 
Spiromax and not to block the air vents when they are preparing the “Breathe” step.  
Patients should also be advised to rinse their mouth with water after inhaling (see section 4.4) 
The  patient  may  notice  a  taste  when  using  Budesonide/Formoterol  Teva  Pharma  B.V.  due  to  the  lactose 
excipient. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or the excipient listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
It is recommended that the dose is tapered when the treatment is discontinued and should not be stopped 
abruptly. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If patients find the treatment ineffective, or exceed the highest recommended dose of Budesonide/Formoterol 
Teva Pharma B.V., medical attention must be sought (see section 4.2). Sudden and progressive deterioration 
in control of asthma is potentially life-threatening and the patient should undergo urgent medical assessment.  
In this situation, consideration should be given to the need for increased therapy with corticosteroids, e.g. a 
course of oral corticosteroids, or antibiotic treatment if an infection is present. 
Patients should be advised to have their rescue inhaler available at all times.  
Patients should be reminded to take their Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. maintenance dose as 
prescribed, even when asymptomatic.   
The prophylactic use of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V., e.g. before exercise, has not been 
studied.  A separate rapid-acting bronchodilator should be considered for such prophylactic use . 
Asthma symptoms 
Patients should be reassessed regularly by their prescriber/healthcare provider so that the dose of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. remains optimal. The dose should be titrated to the lowest dose at 
which effective control of symptoms is maintained. Once asthma symptoms are controlled, consideration 
may be given to gradually reducing the dose of Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. When it is 
appropriate to titrate down to a lower strength than is available for Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma 
B.V., a change to an alternative fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate containing a 
lower dose of the inhaled corticosteroid is required. 
Regular review of patients as treatment is stepped down is important.   
Patients should not be initiated on Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. during an exacerbation, or if 
they have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma.  
Serious asthma-related adverse reactions and exacerbations may occur during treatment with 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek 
medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation with 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath, after 
dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchopasm Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and an alternative therapy instituted, if 
necessary. Paradoxical bronchopasm responds to a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated 
straightaway (see section 4.8). 
Systemic effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long 
periods.  These effects are much less likely to occur with inhalation treatment than with oral corticosteroids.  
Possible systemic effects include Cushing´s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth 
retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma and more 
rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, 
anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children) (see section 4.8). 
It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is 
regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of 
inhaled corticosteroid to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained, if possible. The 
benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. 
In addition consideration should be given to  referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Limited data from long-term studies suggest that most children and adolescents treated with inhaled 
budesonide will ultimately achieve their adult target height. However, an initial small but transient reduction 
in growth (approximately 1 cm) has been observed. This generally occurs within the first year of treatment. 
Effects on bone density 
Potential effects on bone density should be considered, particularly in patients on high doses for prolonged 
periods that have co-existing risk factors for osteoporosis.  
Long-term studies with inhaled budesonide in children at mean daily doses of 400 micrograms (metered 
dose) or in adults at daily doses of 800 micrograms (metered dose) have not shown any significant effects on 
bone mineral density. No information regarding the effect of a budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 
fixed-dose combination at higher doses is available. 
Adrenal function 
If there is any reason to suppose that adrenal function is impaired from previous systemic steroid therapy, 
care should be taken when transferring patients to a  budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed- dose 
combination therapy.  
The benefits of inhaled budesonide therapy would normally minimise the need for oral steroids, but patients 
transferring from oral steroids may remain at risk of impaired adrenal reserve for a considerable time. 
Recovery may take a considerable amount of time after cessation of oral steroid therapy and hence oral 
steroid-dependent patients transferred to inhaled budesonide may remain at risk from impaired adrenal 
function for some considerable time. In such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) 
axis function should be monitored regularly. 
High dose corticosteroids 
The prolonged treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly higher than recommended 
doses, may also result in clinically significant adrenal suppression. Therefore additional systemic 
corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress such as severe infections or elective 
surgery. Rapid reduction in the dose of steroids can induce acute adrenal crisis. Symptoms and signs which 
might be seen in acute adrenal crisis may be somewhat vague but may include anorexia, abdominal pain, 
weight loss, tiredness, headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, hypotension 
and hypoglycaemia. 
Treatment with supplementary systematic steroids or inhaled budesonide should not be stopped abruptly. 
Transfer from oral therapy 
During transfer from oral therapy to a budesonide/formoterol fumarate fixed-dose combination therapy, a 
generally lower systemic steroid action will be experienced which may result in the appearance of allergic or 
arthritic symptoms such as rhinitis, eczema and muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment should be initiated 
for these conditions. A general insufficient glucocorticosteroid effect should be suspected if, in rare cases, 
symptoms such as tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting should occur. In these cases a temporary 
increase in the dose of oral glucocorticosteroids is sometimes necessary. 
Oral infections 
To minimise the risk of oropharyngeal candida infection, the patient should be instructed to rinse their mouth 
out with water after inhaling the dose.  If oropharyngeal thrush occurs, patients should also rinse their mouth 
with water after the as-needed inhalations. 
Interaction with other medicinal products 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant treatment with itraconazole, ritonavir or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided 
(see section 4.5).  If this is not possible the time interval between administrations of the interacting medicinal 
products should be as long as possible.  In patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, a budesonide/formoterol 
fumarate fixed-dose combination is not recommended. 
Caution with special diseases 
A fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate should be administered with 
caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus, untreated hypokalaemia, 
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, idiopathic subvalvular aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, 
aneurysm or other severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmias or 
severe heart failure. 
Caution should be observed when treating patients with prolongation of the QTc-interval. Formoterol itself 
may induce prolongation of the QTc-interval. 
The need for, and dose of inhaled corticosteroids should be re-evaluated in patients with active or quiescent 
pulmonary tuberculosis, fungal and viral infections in the airways. 
Additional blood glucose controls should be considered in diabetic patients. 
β2 adrenoreceptor agonists 
Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from high doses of β2 adrenoceptor agonists.  Concomitant 
treatment of β2 adrenoceptor agonists with medicinal products which can induce hypokalaemia or potentiate 
a hypokalaemic effect, e.g. xanthine-derivatives, steroids and diuretics, may add to a possible hypokalaemic 
effect of the β2 adrenoceptor agonist.   
Treatment with β2 adrenoceptor agonists may result in an increase in blood levels of insulin, free fatty acids, 
glycerol and ketone bodies. 
Particular caution is recommended in unstable asthma with variable use of rescue bronchodilators, in acute 
severe asthma as the associated risk may be augmented by hypoxia and in other conditions when the 
likelihood for hypokalaemia is increased.  It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored 
during these circumstances. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the 
Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.  The excipient 
lactose contains small amounts of milk proteins which may cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Potent  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  (e.g.  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  voriconazole,  posaconazole,  clarithromycin, 
telithromycin,  nefazodone  and  HIV  protease  inhibitors)  are  likely  to  markedly  increase  plasma  levels  of 
budesonide  and  concomitant  use  should  be  avoided.  If  this  is  not  possible  the  time  interval  between 
administration of the inhibitor and budesonide should be as long as possible (see section 4.4).  
The  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor  ketoconazole,  200  mg  once  daily,  increased  plasma  levels  of  concomitantly 
orally  administered  budesonide  (single  dose  3  mg)  on  average  six-fold.  When  ketoconazole  was 
administered 12 hours after budesonide the concentration was on average increased only three-fold showing 
that separation of the administration times can reduce the increase in plasma levels. Limited data about this 
interaction  for  high-dose  inhaled  budesonide  indicates  that  marked  increases  in  plasma  levels  (on  average 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
four  fold)  may  occur  if  itraconazole,  200 mg  once  daily,  is  administered  concomitantly  with  inhaled 
budesonide (single dose of 1000 micrograms). 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
β adrenergic blockers can weaken or inhibit the effect of formoterol. A fixed-dose combination therapy of 
budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate  should  therefore  not  be  given  together  with  β  adrenergic 
blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons. 
Concomitant  treatment  with  quinidine,  disopyramide,  procainamide,  phenothiazines,  antihistamines 
(terfenadine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants can prolong the QTc-interval and 
increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.  
In  addition  L-Dopa,  L-thyroxine,  oxytocin  and  alcohol  can  impair  cardiac  tolerance  towards  β2 
sympathomimetics. 
Concomitant  treatment  with  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors  including  medicinal  products  with  similar 
properties such as furazolidone and procarbazine may precipitate hypertensive reactions. 
There  is  an  elevated  risk  of  arrhythmias  in  patients  receiving  concomitant  anaesthesia  with  halogenated 
hydrocarbons. 
Concomitant use of other β adrenergic medicinal products and anticholinergic medicinal products can have a 
potentially additive bronchodilating effect. 
Hypokalaemia  may  increase  the  disposition  towards  arrhythmias  in  patients  who  are  treated  with  digitalis 
glycosides. 
Budesonide and formoterol have not been observed to interact with any other medicinal products used in the 
treatment of asthma. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For  a fixed-dose combination therapy of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate or the concomitant 
treatment with formoterol and budesonide, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.  Data from 
an  embryo-fetal  development  study  in  the  rat,  showed  no  evidence  of  any  additional  effect  from  the 
combination. 
There  are  no  adequate  data  from  use  of  formoterol  in  pregnant  women.    In  animal  studies  formoterol  has 
caused adverse reactions in reproduction studies at very high systemic exposure levels (see section 5.3). 
Data on approximately 2000 exposed pregnancies indicate no increased teratogenic risk associated with the 
use of inhaled budesonide.  In animal studies glucocorticosteroids have been shown to induce malformations 
(see section 5.3).  This is not likely to be relevant for humans given recommended doses. 
Animal studies have also identified an involvement of excess prenatal glucocorticoids in increased risks for 
intrauterine  growth  retardation,  adult  cardiovascular  disease  and  permanent  changes  in  glucocorticoid 
receptor density, neurotransmitter turnover and behaviour at exposures below the teratogenic dose range.  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During  pregnancy,  a  fixed-dose  combination  therapy  of  budesonide  and  formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate 
should only be used when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  The lowest effective dose of budesonide 
needed to maintain adequate asthma control should be used. 
Breast-feeding 
Budesonide is excreted in breast milk.  However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are 
anticipated.  It is not known whether formoterol passes into human breast milk.  In rats, small amounts of 
formoterol  have  been  detected  in  maternal  milk.    Administration  of  a  fixed-dose  combination  therapy  of 
budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate to women who are breast-feeding should only be considered 
if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child. 
Fertility 
No data on fertility are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Since Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. contains both budesonide and formoterol, the same pattern 
of adverse reactions as reported for these substances may occur.  No increased incidence of adverse reactions 
has  been  seen  following  concurrent  administration  of  the  two  compounds.    The  most  common  adverse 
reactions  are  pharmacologically  predictable  adverse  reactions  of  β2  adrenoceptor  agonist  therapy,  such  as 
tremor and palpitations.  These tend to be mild and usually disappear within a few days of treatment.   
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is not indicated in children and adolescents under the age of 18 
years (see section 4.2). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Candida infection in the oropharynx is due to active substance deposition. Advising the patient to rinse the 
mouth  out  with  water  after  each  dose  will  minimise  the  risk.  Oropharyngeal  Candida  infection  usually 
responds to topical anti-fungal treatment without the need to discontinue the inhaled corticosteroid. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur very rarely, affecting less than 1 in 10,000 people, with an immediate 
increase  in  wheezing  and  shortness  of  breath  after  dosing.  Paradoxical  bronchopasm  responds  to  a  rapid-
acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated straightaway. Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and an alternative therapy is instituted if 
necessary (see section 4.4). 
Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods.  
These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include 
Cushing´s  syndrome,  Cushingoid  features,  adrenal  suppression,  growth  retardation  in  children  and 
adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Increased susceptibility to infections 
and  impairment  of  the  ability  to  adapt  to  stress  may  also  occur.  Effects  are  probably  dependent  on  dose, 
exposure time, concomitant and previous steroid exposure and individual sensitivity. 
Treatment with β2 adrenoceptor agonists may result in an increase in blood levels of insulin, free fatty acids, 
glycerol and ketone bodies.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose of formoterol would likely lead to effects that are typical for β2 adrenoceptor agonists: tremor, 
headache, palpitations.  Symptoms reported from isolated cases are tachycardia, hyperglycaemia, 
hypokalaemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting.  Supportive and symptomatic 
treatment may be indicated.  A dose of 90 micrograms administered during three hours in patients with acute 
bronchial obstruction raised no safety concerns. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute overdose with budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem.  When 
used chronically in excessive doses, systemic glucocorticosteroid effects, such as hypercorticism and adrenal 
suppression, may appear. 
If Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. therapy has to be withdrawn due to overdose of the formoterol 
component of the medicinal product, provision of appropriate inhaled corticosteroid therapy must be 
considered.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic  group:  Drugs  for  obstructive  airway  diseases,  adrenergics  and  other  drugs  for 
obstructive airway diseases. 
ATC code: R03AK07 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. contains formoterol and budesonide, which have different modes 
of action and show additive effects in terms of reduction of asthma exacerbations. The mechanisms of action 
of the two substances respectively are discussed below. 
Budesonide 
Budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid which when inhaled has a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in 
the airways, resulting in reduced symptoms and fewer asthma exacerbations.  Inhaled budesonide has less 
severe adverse reactions than systemic corticosteroids.  The exact mechanism responsible for the anti-
inflammatory effect of glucocorticosteroids is unknown. 
Formoterol 
Formoterol is a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist that when inhaled results in rapid and long-acting 
relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle in patients with reversible airways obstruction.  The bronchodilating 
effect is dose-dependant, with an onset of effect within 1-3 minutes.  The duration of effect is at least 12 
hours after a single dose. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Asthma  
Budesonide/formoterol maintenance therapy 
Clinical  studies  in  adults  have  shown  that  the  addition  of  formoterol  to  budesonide  improved  asthma 
symptoms and lung function, and reduced exacerbations.   
In two 12-week studies the effect on lung function of budesonide/formoterol was equal to that of the free 
combination of budesonide and formoterol, and exceeded that of budesonide alone.  All treatment arms used 
a short-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist as needed.  There was no sign of attenuation of the anti-asthmatic 
effect over time. 
Two 12-week paediatric studies have been performed in which 265 children aged 6-11 years were treated 
with a maintenance dose of budesonide/formoterol (2 inhalations of 80 micrograms/4.5 micrograms 
/inhalation twice daily), and a short acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist as needed. In both studies, lung function 
was improved and the treatment was well tolerated compared to the corresponding dose of budesonide alone. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate through the Spiromax Device  
A randomised, open-label placebo study was performed in children and adolescents with asthma (aged 6-17 
years), adults with asthma (aged 18-45 years)and healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) to evaluate the peak 
inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) and other related inhalation parameters following inhalation from a  Spiromax 
device (containing placebo) compared with inhalation from an already marketed multi-dose dry powder 
inhaler device (containing placebo). The impact of enhanced training in dry powder inhaler inhalation 
technique on inhalation speed and volume was also assessed in these subject groups. The data from the study 
indicated that regardless of age and underlying disease severity, children, adolescents and adults with asthma 
were able to able to achieve inspiratory flow rates through the Spiromax device that were similar to those 
generated through the marketed multi-dose dry powder inhaler device. The mean PIFR achieved by patients 
with asthma was over 60L/min, a flow rate at which both devices studied are known to deliver comparable 
amounts of drug to the lungs. Very few patients had PIFRs below 40L/min; when PIFRs were less than 
40L/min there appeared to be no clustering by age or disease severity. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The fixed-dose combination of budesonide and formoterol, and the corresponding monoproducts have been 
shown to be bioequivalent with regard to systemic exposure of budesonide and formoterol, respectively.  In 
spite of this, a small increase in cortisol suppression was seen after administration of fixed-dose combination 
compared to the monoproducts.  The difference is considered not to have an impact on clinical safety. 
There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interactions between budesonide and formoterol. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for the respective substances were comparable after the administration of 
budesonide and formoterol as monoproducts or as the fixed-dose combination.  For budesonide, AUC was 
slightly higher, rate of absorption more rapid and maximal plasma concentration higher after administration 
of the fixed combination.  For formoterol, maximal plasma concentration was similar after administration of 
the fixed combination. Inhaled budesonide is rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is 
reached within 30 minutes after inhalation.  In studies, mean lung deposition of budesonide after inhalation 
via the powder inhaler ranged from 32% to 44% of the delivered dose.  The systemic bioavailability is 
approximately 49% of the delivered dose.  In children 6-16 years of age the lung deposition falls in the same 
range as in adults for the same given dose. The resulting plasma concentrations were not determined. 
Inhaled formoterol is rapidly absorbed and the maximum plasma concentration is reached within 10 minutes 
after inhalation.  In studies the mean lung deposition of formoterol after inhalation via the powder inhaler 
ranged from 28% to 49% of the delivered dose.  The systemic bioavailability is about 61% of the delivered 
dose.  
Distribution  
Plasma protein binding is approximately 50% for formoterol and 90% for budesonide.  Volume of 
distribution is about 4 L/kg for formoterol and 3 L/kg for budesonide.  Formoterol is inactivated via 
conjugation reactions (active O-demethylated and deformylated metabolites are formed, but they are seen 
mainly as inactivated conjugates).  Budesonide undergoes an extensive degree (approximately 90%) of 
biotransformation on first passage through the liver to metabolites of low glucocorticosteroid activity.  The 
glucocorticosteroid activity of the major metabolites, 6-beta-hydroxy-budesonide and 16-alfa-hydroxy-
prednisolone, is less than 1% of that of budesonide.  There are no indications of any metabolic interactions or 
any displacement reactions between formoterol and budesonide. 
Elimination 
The major part of a dose of formoterol is transformed by liver metabolism followed by renal elimination.  
After inhalation, 8% to 13% of the delivered dose of formoterol is excreted unmetabolised in the urine.  
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Formoterol has a high systemic clearance (approximately 1.4 L/min) and the terminal elimination half-life 
averages 17 hours. 
Budesonide is eliminated via metabolism mainly catalysed by the enzyme CYP3A4.  The metabolites of 
budesonide are eliminated in urine as such or in conjugated form.  Only negligible amounts of unchanged 
budesonide have been detected in the urine.  Budesonide has a high systemic clearance (approximately 1.2 
L/min) and the plasma elimination half-life after i.v. dosing averages 4 hours. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
The pharmacokinetics of budesonide or formoterol in children and patients with renal failure are unknown.  
The exposure of budesonide and formoterol may be increased in patients with liver disease. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. pharmacokinetic profile 
In pharmacokinetic studies with and without a charcoal blockage, Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
was  evaluated  by  comparing  it  with  an  alternative  authorised  fixed-dose  combination  inhaled  product 
containing the same active substances, budesonide and formoterol and has been shown to be equivalent in 
both systemic exposure (safety) and pulmonary deposition (efficacy). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The toxicity observed in animal studies with budesonide and formoterol, given in combination or separately, 
were effects associated with exaggerated pharmacological activity. 
In animal reproduction studies, corticosteroids such as budesonide have been shown to induce malformations 
(cleft palate, skeletal malformations).  However, these animal experimental results do not seem to be relevant 
in humans at the recommended doses.  Animal reproduction studies with formoterol have shown a somewhat 
reduced fertility in male rats at high systemic exposure and implantation losses as well as decreased early 
postnatal survival and birth weight at considerably higher systemic exposures than those reached during 
clinical use.  However, these animal experimental results do not seem to be relevant in humans.

1.  What Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is and what it is used for 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. contains two different active substances: budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate. 
•  Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called ‘corticosteroids’ also known as ‘steroids’.  It works 
by reducing and preventing swelling and inflammation in your lungs and helps you to breathe more 
easily.  
•  Formoterol fumarate dihydrate belongs to a group of medicines called ‘long-acting β2 adrenoceptor 
agonists’ or ‘bronchodilators’.  It works by relaxing the muscles in your airways. This will help to open

3. 
 How to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
•  It is important to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day, even if you have no 
asthma symptoms at the time.  
•  If you are using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. for asthma, your doctor will want to 
regularly check your symptoms.  
Using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. and a separate ‘reliever inhaler’  
Use your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms 
from occurring. 
Recommended dose:  
Adults (18 years and older) 
1 or 2 inhalations (actuations), twice a day.  
Your doctor may increase this to 4 inhalations, twice a day. 
If your symptoms are well controlled, your doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. 
Your doctor will help you to manage your asthma and will adjust the dose of this medicine to the lowest dose 
that controls your asthma.  If your doctor feels that you need a lower dose than is available from your 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V., your doctor may prescribe an alternative inhaler containing the 
same active substances as your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. but with a lower dose of the 
corticosteroid. However, do not adjust the number of inhalations your doctor has prescribed without talking 
to your doctor first. 
Use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’ to treat asthma symptoms when they happen.  
Always keep your ‘reliever inhaler’ with you and use it to relieve sudden attacks of breathlessness and 
wheezing.  Do not use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. to treat these asthma symptoms. 
Use of your ‘reliever inhaler’ should not exceed 8 inhalations (puffs) in any 24 hours and you should 
not use your ‘reliever inhaler’ more often than every 4 hours.  If you are regularly using up to 8 
inhalations a day or you need to increase the amount of ‘reliever inhaler’ you require, you should see 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your doctor as soon as possible.  Your doctor may need to change your treatment in order to reduce 
your symptoms of asthma (breathlessness, wheezing and cough) and improve your asthma control and 
make your breathing easier.  
If you are doing exercise and you get asthma symptoms, use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’ to relieve these 
symptoms. Do not use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. just before exercise to stop asthma 
symptoms from occurring, use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’. 
Preparing your new Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.  
Before using your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. for the first time, you need to prepare it for 
use as follows: 
•  Check the dose indicator to see that there are 120 inhalations in the inhaler. 
•  Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label of the inhaler. 
•  Do not shake your inhaler before use. 
How to take an inhalation 
Every time you need to take an inhalation, follow the instructions below. 
1.    Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent wine red mouthpiece cover at the bottom. 
2.  Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until one loud click is heard. Your medicine is actively 
metered. Your inhaler is now ready for use. 
3.  Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. 
4.   Place the mouthpiece between your teeth. Do not bite the mouthpiece. Close your lips around the 
mouthpiece. Take care not to block the air vents. 
Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you can. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.   Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. 
6.  Remove your inhaler from your mouth.  You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation.  
7. Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler).  Close the mouthpiece cover.  
If you are to take a second inhalation, repeat steps 1 to 7. 
Rinse your mouth with water after every dose, and spit it out.  
Do not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover, it is fixed to your inhaler and 
must not be taken off.  Do not use your Spiromax if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has come apart 
from your Spiromax. Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to use your inhaler.  
Cleaning your Spiromax 
Keep your Spiromax dry and clean. 
If necessary you may wipe the mouthpiece of your Spiromax after use with a dry cloth or tissue. 
When to start using a new Spiromax 
•  The dose indicator tells you how many doses (inhalations) are left in your inhaler, starting with 120 
inhalations when it is full.  
45 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The dose indicator, on the rear of the device, shows the number of inhalations remaining in even 
numbers only. 
•  For inhalations remaining from 20 downwards to ‘8’, 6’,’4’,’2’  the numbers are displayed in red on a 
white background. When the numbers become red in the window, you should consult your doctor and 
obtain a new inhaler. 
Note:  
•  The mouthpiece will still ‘click’ even when your Spiromax is empty.  
• 
If you open and close the mouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose indicator will still register it 
as a count.  This dose will be securely held inside the inhaler for when the next inhalation is due. It is 
impossible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation.  
•  Keep the mouthpiece closed all the time unless you are about to use your inhaler.  
Important information about your asthma symptoms 
If you feel you are getting breathless or wheezy while using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V., you 
should continue to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.  but go to see your doctor as soon as 
possible, as you may need additional treatment. 
Contact your doctor immediately if: 
•  Your breathing is getting worse or you often wake up at night with breathlessness and wheezing. 
•  Your chest starts to feel tight in the morning or your chest tightness lasts longer than usual. 
These signs could mean that your asthma is not being properly controlled and you may need different or 
additional treatment immediately. 
Once your asthma is well controlled your doctor may consider it appropriate to gradually reduce the dose of 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
If you use more Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. than you should 
It is important that you take your dose as advised by your doctor. You should not exceed your prescribed 
dose without seeking medical advice. 
If you use more Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. than you should, contact your doctor, pharmacist 
or nurse for advice. 
The  most  common  symptoms  that  may  occur  after  if  you  use  more  Budesonide/Formoterol  Teva  Pharma 
B.V. than you should are trembling, headache or a rapid heartbeat.  
If you forget to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However do not take a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. If it is nearly time for your next dose just take your next dose at the usual time.  
If you become wheezy or breathless, or develop any other symptoms of an asthma attack, use your ‘reliever 
inhaler’, then seek medical advice.  
If you stop using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
Do not stop using your inhaler without telling your doctor first.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

1.  What Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is and what it is used for 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. contains two different active substances: budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate. 
• 
• 
Budesonide belongs to a group of medicines called ‘corticosteroids’ also known as ‘steroids’.  It 
works by reducing and preventing swelling and inflammation in your lungs and helps you to breathe 
more easily.  
Formoterol fumarate dihydrate belongs to a group of medicines called ‘long-acting β2 adrenoceptor 
agonists’ or ‘bronchodilators’.  It works by relaxing the muscles in your airways. This will help to 
open the airways and help you to breathe more easily. 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated for use in adults 18 years of age and older only.  
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. is NOT indicated for use in children, 12 years of age and 
younger or adolescents, 13 to 17 years of age. 
Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat asthma.  
Asthma 
To treat your asthma your doctor will prescribe Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. together 
with a separate ‘reliever inhaler’ such as salbutamol. 
•  Use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms such 
as breathlessness and wheezing from occurring.  
•  Use the ‘reliever inhaler’ when you get asthma symptoms, to make it easier to breathe again.  
Do not use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 320/9 micrograms as a ‘reliever inhaler’. 
51

you may feel generally unwell even though your chest symptoms may be improving. You might experience 
symptoms such as a stuffy or runny nose, weakness or joint or muscle pain and rash (eczema). If any of these 
symptoms bother you, or if symptoms such as headache, tiredness, nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting (being 
sick) occur, please contact your doctor immediately. You may need to take other medicines if you develop

 How to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. 
•  It is important to use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day, even if you have no 
asthma symptoms at the time.  
•  If you are using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. for asthma, your doctor will want to 
regularly check your symptoms.  
Using Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. and a separate ‘reliever inhaler’  
Use your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. every day. This helps to prevent asthma symptoms 
from occurring.  
 Recommended dose:  
Adults (18 years and older ) 
1 inhalation (actuation), twice a day.  
Your doctor may increase this to 2 inhalations, twice a day. 
If your symptoms are well controlled, your doctor may ask you to take your medicine once a day. 
Your doctor will help you to manage your asthma and will adjust the dose of this medicine to the lowest dose 
that  controls  your  asthma.    If  your  doctor  feels  that  you  need  a  lower  dose  than  is  available  from  your 
Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V., your doctor may prescribe an alternative inhaler containing the 
same  active  substances  as  your  Budesonide/Formoterol  Teva  Pharma  B.V.  but  with  a  lower  dose  of  the 
corticosteroid. However, do not adjust the number of inhalations your doctor has prescribed without talking 
to your doctor first. 
Use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’ to treat asthma symptoms when they happen.  
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always  keep  your  ‘reliever  inhaler’  with  you  and  use  it  to  relieve  sudden  attacks  of  breathlessness  and 
wheezing. Do not use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. to treat these asthma symptoms.  
Use of your ‘reliever inhaler’ should not exceed 8 inhalations (puffs) in any 24 hours and you should 
not use your ‘reliever inhaler’ more often than every 4 hours.  If you are regularly using up to 8 
inhalations a day or you need to increase the amount of ‘reliever inhaler’ you require, you should see 
your doctor as soon as possible.  Your doctor may need to change your treatment in order to reduce 
your symptoms of asthma (breathlessness, wheezing and cough) and improve your asthma control and 
make your breathing easier.  
If you are doing exercise and you get asthma symptoms, use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’ to relieve these 
symptoms. Do not use Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.  just before exercise to stop asthma 
symptoms from occurring, use your separate ‘reliever inhaler’. 
Preparing your new Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V. 
Before using your Budesonide/Formoterol Teva Pharma B.V.for the first time, you need to prepare it for 
use as follows: 
•  Check the dose indicator to see that there are 60 inhalations in the inhaler.  
•  Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label of the inhaler. 
•  Do not shake your inhaler before use. 
How to take an inhalation 
Every time you need to take an inhalation, follow the instructions below. 
1.    Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent wine red mouthpiece cover at the bottom. 
2.  Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until one loud click is heard. Your medicine is actively 
metered. Your inhaler is now ready for use. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. 
4.   Place the mouthpiece between your teeth. Do not bite the mouthpiece. Close your lips around the 
mouthpiece. Take care not to block the air vents. 
Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you can.  
5.   Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. 
6.    Remove your inhaler from your mouth. You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation.    
7.  Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler). Close the mouthpiece cover.  
If you are to take a second inhalation, repeat steps 1 to 7. 
Rinse your mouth with water after every dose and spit it out.  
Do not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover, it is fixed to your inhaler and 
must not be taken off.  Do not use your Spiromax if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has come apart 
from your Spiromax. Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to use your inhaler.  
Cleaning your Spiromax 
Keep your Spiromax dry and clean. 
If necessary you may wipe the mouthpiece of your Spiromax after use with a dry cloth or tissue. 
When to start using a new Spiromax 
•  The  dose  indicator  tells  you  how  many  doses  (inhalations)  are  left  in  your  inhaler,  starting  with  60 
inhalations when it is full. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The dose indicator, on the rear of the device, shows the number of inhalations remaining in even 
numbers only. 
•  For inhalations remaining from 20 downwards to ‘8’, ‘6’, ‘4’, ‘2’ the numbers are displayed in red on a 
white background. When the numbers become red in the window, you should consult your doctor and 
obtain a new inhaler. 
Note:  
•  The mouthpiece will still ‘click’ even when your Spiromax is empty.  
• 
If you open and close the mouthpiece without taking an inhalation, the dose indicator will still register it 
as a count. This dose will be securely held inside the inhaler for when the next inhalation is due. It is 
impossible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation.  
•  Keep the mouthpiece closed all the time unless you are about to use your inhaler.

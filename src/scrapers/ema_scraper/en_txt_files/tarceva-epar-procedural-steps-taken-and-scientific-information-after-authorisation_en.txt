The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 7.1 has been agreed, as part of this

holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor 
editorial changes in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1

years) with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in the 
second-line setting after failure on chemotherapy, the 300 
mg dose of Tarceva demonstrated no PFS benefit over the 
recommended dose (7.00 vs 6.86 weeks, respectively). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were all consistent with the 
primary endpoint and no difference was detected for OS 
between patients treated with erlotinib 300 mg and 150 mg 
daily (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.32). 
Safety data were comparable between the 300 mg and 150 
mg doses; however, there was a numerical increase in the 
incidence of rash, interstitial lung disease and diarrhoea, in 
patients receiving the higher dose of erlotinib. Based on the 
data from the CURRENTS study, no evidence was seen for 
any benefit of a higher erlotinib dose of 300 mg when 
compared with the recommended dose of 150 mg in active 
smokers. 
Patients in this study were not selected based on EGFR 
mutation status.

A validated, robust, reliable and sensitive test with a 
prespecified positivity threshold and demonstrated utility 
for the determination of EGFR mutation status, using either 
tumor DNA derived from a tissue sample or circulating free 
DNA (cfDNA) obtained from a blood (plasma) sample, 
should be performed according to local medical practice.  
If a plasma-based cfDNA test is used and the result is 
negative for activating mutations, perform a tissue test 
wherever possible due to the potential for false negative 
results from a plasma-based test.

Very rare cases of corneal perforation or ulceration have 
been reported during use of Tarceva. Other ocular 
disorders including abnormal eyelash growth, 
keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis have been observed 
with Tarceva treatment which are also risk factors for 
corneal perforation/ulceration. Tarceva therapy should be 
interrupted or discontinued if patients present with 
acute/worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain.  
Patients receiving Tarceva are at increased risk of 
developing gastrointestinal perforation, which was observed 
uncommonly. Patients receiving concomitant anti-
angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and/or taxane 
based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic 
ulceration or diverticular disease are at increased risk. 
Tarceva should be permanently discontinued in patients 
who develop gastrointestinal perforation. 
Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been 
reported, including very rare cases suggestive of Stevens-
Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis, which in 
some cases were fatal Tarceva treatment should be 
interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops severe 
bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions.

As a part of the opinion for the original application for 
information on the use of Tarceva in patients with

The package leaflet has been revised accordingly. 
The MAH has also applied to amend the Labelling

several editorial changes to the Package Leaflet to 
improve readability as well as to update the contact 
details in the list of local representatives for Estonia 
and Finland.

Open-Label Study to Characterize the Pharmacokinetic 
Parameters of Erlotinib (Tarceva®, OSI-774) in Cancer 
Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors with Adequate and 
Moderately Impaired Hepatic Function". Based on these 
available study results the MAH applied for an update of 
section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC.  
SPC sections 4.2 and 5.2 as well as the respective PL 
sections have been updated appropriately to reflect the 
results of study OSI-774-104 investigating the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of a single oral 150 mg dose 
of erlotinib in cancer patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7 to 9) compared to 
patients with adequate hepatic function.  
The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of erlotinib in 
moderately hepatic-impaired patients suggest that initiation 
of erlotinib treatment at a reduced dose is not required in 
cancer patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Nevertheless caution is advised when Tarceva is 
administered to patients with moderately impaired hepatic 
function, reflecting the limited clinical data available.

relation to hair and nail changes as an association of 
certain hair and nail changes such as paronychia, hirsutism, 
eyelash/eyebrow changes, brittle and loose nails with 
erlotinib is suspected. 
The MAH also applied to update the Labelling to include 
information in Braille. The package leaflet was updated 
accordingly to reflect the SPC changes. In addition, editorial 
changes to the Package Leaflet were introduced to improve 
readability and to update the contact details in the list of

adequately designed interaction study evaluating the effect 
of ciprofloxacin 750 mg BID on a single dose of 100 mg 
erlotinib.  
Ciprofloxacin leads to a significant increase in erlotinib AUC 
while no statistically significant changes in Cmax were 
found. The active metabolite exposure also increased about 
60% and 48% for the AUC and Cmax respectively.  These 
results were adequately reflected in the SPC. 
The marketing authorisation holder has also conducted an 
adequately designed interaction study evaluating the effect 
of omeprazole 40 mg daily for 7 days on a single dose of 
150 mg erlotinib. AUC exposure was reduced by about 46 
and 58% for erlotinib and metabolite, respectively. For 
Page 19/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cmax reductions of 61 and 69% for erlotinib and the 
primary metabolite, respectively, was found. No adverse 
reactions could be attributed to the combination of drugs.  
These reductions are of a moderate to substantial order of 
magnitude. The clinical significance is unknown, but a 
reduced clinical effect cannot be excluded as in practise the 
outcome of the interaction study, leads to the advice to 
avoid concomitant use of PPIs. This would mean that 
certain gastrointestinal conditions may be undertreated 
when Tarceva is to be administered. 
It can be considered that the general risk of underexposure 
to Tarceva used for the treatment of life threatening 
conditions (non-small cell lung cancer or pancreatic cancer) 
outweighs the risk of undertreatment of e.g. acid burn, 
ulcus ventriculi, reflux-oesophagitis, reflux and dyspepsia, 
particularly in light of the fact that alternative treatment 
regimens could be envisaged for these diseases. Depending 
on the severity of the upper GI condition opposite the need 
to treat the underlying cancer (NSCLC or pancreatic cancer) 
effectively, the treating physician may still assess the 
risk/benefit for their individual patient and give appropriate 
treatment guidance.

minor editorial changes to the SPC and Package Leaflet. 
The MAH proposed to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SPC to include clarification on events of dehydration, 
hypokalaemia and renal failure. 'Alopecia' has been added 
as a common undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Further details are provided in section 4.8 of the SPC with 
regards to "infection" where severe infections, with or 
without neutropenia, have included pneumonia, sepsis and 
cellulitis. In section 4.8 of the SPC, it was clarified that the 
term 'rash' included dermatitis acneiform. Information on 
rare cases of hepatic failure is also added in sections 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP considers that sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC 
have been updated appropriately to reflect the outcome of 
the 3rd PSUR assessment. The additional information 
included in section 4.4 and section 4.8 of the SPC and 
section 4 of the Package Leaflet in relation to hepatic failure 
is also considered acceptable.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Based on the results of these interaction studies, the MAH 
proposed to include the following statements in section 4.5 
of the SPC: 
Page 21/24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
'Pretreatment or coadministration of Tarceva did not alter 
the clearance of the prototypical CYP3A4 substrates, 
midazolam and erythromycin, but did appear to decrease 
the oral bioavailability of midazolam by up to 24%. In 
another clinical study, erlotinib was shown not to affect 
pharmacokinetics of the concomitantly administered 
CYP3A4/2C8 substrate paclitaxel. Significant interactions 
with the clearance of other CYP3A4 substrates are therefore 
unlikely.' 
[_] 
'Co-administration of rifampicin with a single 450 mg dose 
of Tarceva resulted in a mean erlotinib exposure (AUC) of 
57.5% of that after a single 150 mg Tarceva dose in the 
absence of rifampicin treatment. Co-administration of 
Tarceva with CYP3A4 inducers should therefore be avoided. 
For patients who require concomitant treatment with 
Tarceva and a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin an 
increase in dose to 300 mg should be considered while their 
safety (including renal and liver functions and serum 
electrolytes) is closely monitored, and if well tolerated for 
more than 2 weeks, further increase to 450 mg could be 
considered with close safety monitoring.' 
[_] 
'Erlotinib increases platinum concentrations. In a clinical 
study, the concomitant use of erlotinib with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel led to an increase of total platinum AUC0-48 of 
10.6%. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of 
this difference is not considered to be clinically relevant. In 
clinical practice, there may be othe

1.  Introduction 
On 02 June, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Takhzyro, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that SHP643-302: A Phase 3 Multi-center, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy 
and Safety of Lanadelumab (SHP643) in Japanese Subjects with Hereditary Angioedema is a stand-
alone study. 
Of note, a procedure to extend the indication to children from the age of 2 years is currently under 
assessment in the EU (EMEA/H/C/004806/X/0034/G). 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
SHP643-302: A Phase 3 Multi-center, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Lanadelumab (SHP643) in Japanese Subjects with Hereditary Angioedema 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
SHP643-302: A Phase 3 Multi-center, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Lanadelumab (SHP643) in Japanese Subjects with Hereditary Angioedema 
Description 
SHP643-302 was an open-label Phase 3 study planned to enrol approximately eight Japanese subjects, 
12 years of age and older, with HAE Type I or II.  
The study was intended to bridge the clinical data from global registration studies to Japanese HAE 
subjects; therefore, the study design for SHP643-302 was similar to that of the global pivotal study, 
DX-2930-03, with respect to readout of primary endpoint (26 weeks), dosing regimen (lanadelumab 
300 mg q2wks), and efficacy outcome measures (e.g., reduction in HAE attacks).  
Assessor’s comment 
Takhzyro was approved in the EU in 2018 (EMEA/H/C/4806) for Routine prevention of recurrent 
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. Study DX-2930-03 is 
thoroughly described and assessed in that procedure.

Results 
Recruitment 
Eight subjects were recruited to the study. One subject (8.3%) was aged <18 years. 
Baseline data 
The age of onset of angioedema symptoms for the paediatric patient was <5 years. This subject 
experienced 27 attacks in the 12 months prior to screening and had an attack rate of 4.24 during the 
run-in period. The primary location of attacks was peripheral. 
Efficacy results 
The paediatric patient had no HAE attacks during the period of Day 0 through Day 182 (i.e., Treatment 
Period A). The subject switched to q4wks dosing in Treatment Period B and subsequently had 1 HAE 
attack corresponding to an attack rate of 0.08 per month for the period of Day 0 through Day 364 
(i.e., the 52-week treatment period). The HAE attack was moderate in severity. The investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) dose was not changed in response to the attack. 
Assessor’s comment 
There is no indication of lack of efficacy in the single subject < 18 years of age in Study SHP643-302. 
Safety results 
The paediatric patient had 5 non-HAE attack AEs during the overall treatment period (Day 0 through 
Day 364): 1 event of injection site swelling and 2 events of injection site reaction (all classified as

AESIs); 1 event of intercostal neuralgia; and 1 event under the System Organ Classes (SOC) 
Reproductive system and breast disorders.  
The AEs of injection site swelling, and injection site reaction were all considered by the investigator to 
be related to the IMP. The other 2 AEs were considered to be not related to the IMP.  
All of the AEs were mild in severity and were not reported as an SAE. All of the AEs resolved, and no 
action was taken with the IMP. 
The subject also had 1 HAE attack AE during the overall treatment period. This event was moderate in 
severity and considered not related to the IMP. The event was not reported as an SAE and was not 
classified as an AESI. The event resolved and no action was taken with the IMP. 
Assessor’s comment 
Injection site reactions are well-known adverse reactions to Takhzyro.  
No new safety concerns were reported in the single subject < 18 years of age in Study SHP643-302. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
One subject < 18 years of age was included in the Japanese Study SHP643-302 to bridge the clinical 
data from global registration studies to Japanese HAE subjects. Efficacy and safety in this subject were 
fully in line with the new profile for Takhzyro. No additional actions are considered needed.  
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No additional actions are considered needed. The B/R for Takhzyro remains unchanged. 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  HBVAXPRO.  This 
scientific  discussion  has  been  updated  until  01  September  2004.    For  information  on  changes 
after this date please refer to module 8B

Introduction 
HBVAXPRO is a thiomersal free vaccine which is indicated for active immunisation against hepatitis 
B virus infection caused by all known subtypes in all age categories considered at risk of exposure to 
hepatitis B virus. 
It  is  prepared  by  recombinant  DNA  technology,  in  yeast  culture  of  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, 
permitting the large scale production of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) particles similar to 
naturally occurring particles; the manufacturing process minimises risk of contamination.  
This vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs). Development of an anti-
HBs titre above 10 IU/l measured 1-2 months after the last injection correlates with protection against 
hepatitis B virus infection.  
The rationale for the development of HBVAXPRO takes into account the EMEA´s public statement 
from  July  1999  (EMEA/20962/99)  on  thiomersal  containing  medicinal  products.  It  is  currently 
licensed as the thiomersal-containing version in all member states as a MRP product, due to its former 
ex-concertation status.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Hepatitis  B  Vaccine  (Recombinant)  is  composed  of  highly  purified  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen 
(HBsAg)  adsorbed  to  an  aluminum  adjuvant.  The  antigen  is  produced  from  the  fermentation  of  a 
recombinant  strain  of  yeast,  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae.  Following  purification,  the  antigen  is 
formulated  and  filled  into  one  of  three  final  container  formulations.  No  thiomersal  is  added  to  the 
finished product. 
The  pharmaceutical  form  of  this  vaccine  is  a  suspension  for  intramuscular  injection  and  the  final 
product is presented in a pre-filled syringe (with or without needle) or in a vial. The proposed shelf life 
is three years for the vial and syringe presentations when stored between +2°C and + 8°C. 
The 3 mL glass vials are closed by rubber stoppers and capped with aluminum seals with plastic caps.  
The 1.5 mL glass barrel pre-filled syringe is presented with or without an attached needle. The seal is 
a  deep  threaded  grey  butyl  stopper  and  a  polypropylene  plunger  rod  is  screwed  into  the  stopper. 
Stopper  and  plunger  rod  specifications  remain  the  same  for  both  the  fixed-needle  and  needleless 
images.  
Syringes  equipped  with  a  fixed  needle:  Needlelength=5/8  inch.  A  needle  guard  is  placed  over  the 
needle and a polypropylene needle shield is placed over the needle guard.  
Syringes without  a needle: Glass container is a Luer Tip syringe with a plastic Luer-Lok™ Adapter 
and gray E-Z grip tip cap. The needleless syringe barrel is composed of identical material, but lacks 
the fixed needle. A Luer-Lok™ adapter covered with a rubber tip cap  maintains sterility and allows 
flexibility in needle gauge and length chosen for administration. 
Active substance 
HBVAXPRO  contains  Hepatitis  B  virus  surface  antigen  (HBsAg).  This  is  a  hydrophobic  24  kDa 
membrane proteine called the S protein which is the active immunogen in the vaccine.

Expression system and cell banks 
The  biosynthesis  of  the  HBsAg  utilizes  a  recombinant  plasmid  expressed  in  the  host  cell 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae   The plasmid codes for a 24 kDa membrane protein called the S protein. 
The  Pre-Master,  Master,  and  Working  Seed  lots  were  prepared  according  to  the  same  procedure 
consisting  of  re-suspension  in  a  medium  containing  17%  glycerol.  The  cultures  obtained  were 
aliquoted, frozen and stored at a temperature of ≤ -60 °C.  
Fermentation and Purification 
The  fermentation  process  yields  approximately  2100  L  of  final  culture.  The  yeast  cells  are 
concentrated  and  diafiltered  to  produce  an  approximately  40%  cell  suspension.  The  purification 
process  includes  two  phases,  Phase  1  Purification  (from  cell  lysate  to  Concentrated  Silica  Product, 
CSP) and Phase 2 Purification (from CSP to Sterile Filtered Product, SFP). The formulation process 
also  includes  two  phases,  Formaldehyde  Treatment  (from  SFP  to  Final  Aqueous  Product,  FAP)  and 
Alum Co-precipitation (from FAP to Bulk Alum Product, BAP). 
Product development and finished product 
In  July  1999,  the  EMEA  made  a  public  statement  on  thiomersal  containing  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/20962/99) recommending  the  promotion  for general  use of vaccines  without thiomersal and 
other  mercurial  containing  preservatives,  particularly  for  single  dose  vaccines,  and  this  within  the 
shortest possible timeframe. Merck & Co., Inc. therefore eliminated thiomersal from the monovalent 
Hepatitis  B  vaccine.  The  preservative  free  product  is  manufactured  using  the  same  intermediate, 
thiomersal free 40 µg Bulk Alum Product, already licensed and used in the preservative free vaccines, 
PROCOMVAX  and  HEXAVAC.  For  Hepatitis  B  Vaccine  (Recombinant),  this  intermediate  will  be 
diluted to obtain the concentration of 10 µg/ml for the final product (for the 5 µg/0.5 ml and 10 µg/1.0 
ml formulation) or used undiluted for the 40 µg/1.0 ml formulation. 
The  formulation  of  Hepatitis  B  Vaccine  (Recombinant)  used  in  clinical  studies  contained  the 
preservative, thiomersal (1:20,000). The formulation of the vaccine proposed for marketing does not 
contain thiomersal. With the exception of the absence of thiomersal, the formulation for the finished 
recombinant vaccine is the formulation developed for the Hepatitis B vaccine currently marketed by 
Aventis Pasteur MSD. 
Status of GMP inspection 
Manufacture  of  the  hepatitis  B  vaccine  is  in  compliance  with  GMP  regulations.  Current  production 
facilities have been inspected by EEC inspectors during the past 2 to 3 years. As a follow up measure 
the Rapporteur has requested inspection of the bulk manufacturing and filling facilities which have not 
yet been inspected. 
Product characterisation and process validation 
An  extensive  characterization  was  performed  on  products  from  four  demonstration  lots.  The  same 
tests and procedures used to characterize the demonstration lots were used for the previous analysis of 
the pilot lots described in the Type II variation n° FR\H\23\01-05\W13.  
The  process  was  validated  using  critical  process  parameters  (CPP)  and  critical  quality  attributes 
(CQA) based on historical data  
The  high  level  of  product  purity  was  supported  by  the  characterization  studies.  In  addition,  process 
validation  was  used  to  show  the  decrease  in  levels  of  cell-derived  biomolecules  through  the 
purification. Release testing monitored the clearance of any reagents added during processing. It was 
concluded from these analyses that product purity was high and consistent. 
In  addition,  preclinical  studies  in  C3H  mice  showed  that  the  BAP  was  equivalent  in  potency  to  a 
process standard. 
Control of the Finished Product 
Specifications  and  routine  testing  are  performed  on  each  batch  of  final  container  product.    Testing 
includes: sterility, fill volume, LAL, Identity, In Vitro Relative Potency, aluminum, pH, and sodium 
chloride.

Stability of the Product 
Both  real  time  data  (2-8  (cid:31)C
Preservative Free BAP stability lots.  
and  data  from  accelerated  stability  studies  (25  (cid:31)C)  are  provided  on 
To  date,  test  results  for  In  Vitro  Relative  Potency,  pH,  sterility,  and  LAL  all  remain  within  release 
specifications for all three lots stored at 4 (cid:31)C. Stability studies are ongoing. 
Stability  data  from  an  accelerated  study  show  a  stability  profile  which  is  consistent  with  historical 
stability  data  for  Thiomersal  Containing  final  container  product  stored  at  25  (cid:31)C.  Therefore,  the 
presence or absence of thiomersal is not considered to have an impact on the stability of HBsAg. 
In  addition,  historical  data  are  provided  to  demonstrate  consistently  stable  potency  of  the  active 
ingredient  when  stored  at  4  (cid:31)C  by  comparing  Preservative  Free  and  Thiomersal  Containing  BAP. 
Statistical  comparison  shows  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  difference  in  IVRP,  level  of  response  or 
degradation profile among formulations (Preservative Free versus Thiomersal Containing). 
Based on the satisfactory real time stability  data from the three  Preservative  Free BAP lots and that 
there are ongoing stability studies, a 36 month shelf life is warranted. This dating is supported by the 
fact that accelerated data on these three BAP lots are consistent with Thiomersal Containing product 
and that historical stability database provides no difference in level of response or degradation profile 
for Preservative Free or Thiomersal Containing BAP.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Most of the data  presented are derived from studies conducted on the applicant´s currently licensed, 
thiomersal-containing, hepatitis B vaccine, hereafter referred to as HBVAX or RECOMBIVAX. 
Potency 
The manufacturer performed preclinical studies comparing HBVAXPRO with their currently licensed 
thiomersal-containing  recombinant  hepatitis  B  vaccine.  All  4  tested  lots  had  ED50  values  that  were 
lower (i.e., more potent) or equivalent to those of the control vaccine.

Toxicology 
The tested substance was Hep B Thiomersal-Free Bulk Vaccine as Part of HEXAVAC development 
which  was carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  current guideline (CPMP/SWP/465/95) for  preclinical 
pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of  vaccines.  Its  assessment  included  acute  toxicology  and 
repeat dose toxicology studies. 
Single dose toxicity 
HEXAVAC® safety was evaluated in the mouse by subcutaneous route to mimic the human route of 
exposure  (injected  dose:  40  human  dose/kg)  and  in  the  rat  by  intraperitoneal  route  to  obtain  a  rapid 
bioavailability (injected dose: 12.5 human dose/kg). Both studies were performed according to Good 
3/10 
EMEA 2005   
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Laboratory Practices. The doses tested are relatively high considering that one human dose for a 6 kg 
infant is equivalent to 0.17 human dose/kg of human body weight. 
No  signs  of  toxicity  were  noted  in  both  species  through  clinical  observation  and  gross  necropsy 
examination.  The  local  reactions  observed  in  the  mouse  at  the  subcutaneous  injection  site  were  as 
expected for an adjuvanted vaccine. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The absence of toxicity was evaluated after repeated administrations in the rat according to treatment 
schedules mimicking a human vaccination scheme (i.e., 3 injections at monthly intervals). 
The  fourth  dose  which  was  administered  6  months  to  1  year  after  the  third  dose  in  the  human 
vaccination scheme for HEXAVAC® was not included in this toxicology study design. However, it is 
considered that the second and the third injections were sufficient to boost the immune response and to 
reveal  potential  adverse  reactions.  The  subcutaneous  route  was  considered  equivalent  in  terms  of 
bioavailability to the intramuscular clinical route and a dose level of 5 human doses per kg was tested 
(human  dose  level:  0.17  human  dose/kg  of  human  body  weight).  A  control  group  only  received 
aluminium  adjuvant,  while  a  reference  group  received,  in  an  identical  manner,  a  pentavalent 
adjuvanted  vaccine  lot  which  is  already  marketed  (differs  from  HEXAVAC®  by  the  presence  of 
cellular  (whole  cell)  pertussis  antigens  and  the  absence  of  HBs  antigen).  All  clinical  observations 
followed  by  gross  and  histopathologic  examinations  and  blood  assays  (haematological  and 
biochemical)  at  completion  of  treatment  revealed  changes  attributed  to  the  vaccine  properties  of  the 
reference and tested vaccines. None of these findings had a toxicological significance. 
Based on the design of this repeated dose toxicology study, no immuno-toxicological findings such as 
autoimmune reactions were observed. It is noted that this animal study revealed no kidney or vascular 
lesions justifying further examinations or indicating potential immune complex deposition. 
No hypersensitivity reactions were noted after the second or the third administrations. 
Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects 
The comparative mouse immunogenicity test performed with the hepatitis B vaccine with and without 
thiomersal indicates that there is at least equivalent immunogenicity of both products. However, it is 
controversial to what extent these data can be extrapolated to humans.  
There  is  no  clinical  evidence  that  increased  immunogenicity  is  correlated  with  increased 
reactogenicity. 
Pre-clinical  data  are  considered  to  be  sufficent.  The  data  from  the  HEXAVAC  and  PROCOMVAX 
studies  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  monovalent,  thiomersal-free  hepatitis  B  vaccine.  Separate  studies 
would not provide any new knowledge on the pre-clinical safety profile of HBVAXPRO. 
The  thiomersal-free  monovalent  hepatitis  B  vaccine  that  is  the  subject  of  this  application  has  been 
shown to be both safe and immunogenic in preclinical animal models. 
The  thiomersal-containing  vaccine  was  shown  to  have  no  detectable  acute  toxicity  in  mice  and  rats 
and  to  pass  the  general  safety  test  in  guinea  pigs.  In  addition,  a  special  assay  was  run  to  test  for 
possible anaphylactic reactions to potential yeast antigen contaminants of the HBs vaccine. 
No  anaphylactic  reactions  were  detected  when  multiple  lots  of  the  vaccine  were  tested.  In  addition, 
recent  studies  with  the  thiomersal-free,  hepatitis  B-containing  combination  vaccine,  HEXAVAC® 
showed no detectable toxicity in acute or repeated dose studies.  
In-vivo  potency  testing  in  C3H  mice  showed  the  thiomersal-free  vaccine  to  be  highly  potent  and 
comparable  to  that  of  the  thiomersal-containing  formulation.  Therefore,  based  on  historic  (indirect) 
and on product related data there is no scientific basis for contraindications to the use of HBVAXPRO. 
4. 
Part IV: Clinical aspects 
No  formal  clinical  trial  has  been  performed  with  HBVAXPRO  in  most  of  the  target  populations 
included in the proposed indications e.g. newborns of HBsAg positive mothers, infants, toddlers and 
adult persons at risk.  
4/10 
EMEA 2005   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However,  there  are  extrapolated  clinical  data  on  the  efficacy,  immunogenicity  and  safety  of 
HBVAXPRO which are based on different sources:  
PROCOMVAX  pre-  and  post-authorisation  safety  and  immunogenicity  data  (evaluated  in  the 
Centralized Procedure) 
HEXAVAC pre-licensure data (idem) 
Post-marketing surveillance data of the thiomersal-free vaccine in high risk infants in the U.S. 
Post-marketing safety data of the thiomersal-free vaccine in the U.S. 
A  post-authorisation  study  will  be  performed  in  young  adults  to  confirm  non-inferiority  of  the 
thiomersal free vaccine towards the thiomersal containg regarding efficay and safety. 
Clinical efficacy  
Efficacy in high risk infants 
• 
Surveillance data by New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) on vaccination of high 
risk infants 
Infants  born  to  HBsAg  positive  mothers  are  vaccinated  while  their  immune  systems  are  premature. 
Therefore, the high risk infant population provides a stringent test of the effectiveness of a hepatitis B 
vaccine.  
Surveillance data on the efficacy of the thiomersal-free hepatitis B vaccine in high-risk infants born to 
HBsAg positive mothers were provided by the New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH). 
The NYCDOH provides services to over 7 million residents of New York with an annual birth cohort 
of  approximately  125.000.  The  recommended  vaccination  regime  is  HBIG  at  birth  plus  a  3-dose 
course of vaccine beginning while the infant is in the hospital with subsequent doses at approximately 
1 and 6 months of age. Serological assessment of hepatitis B antigen and antibody status in these high-
risk infants is conducted 1 to 3 months after completion of the vaccine series. Thus, a high proportion 
of  infants  in  the  2000  time  period  has  not  been  serologically  checked  for  hepatitis  B  antigen  and 
antibody status.

Extrapolated studies 
• 
Post-marketing study on PROCOMVAX (Preliminary assessment report September 2000) 
entiteld: ”Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity probe study of COMVAX using various 
levels of PRP in South African infants” (study protocol 10) 
PROCOMVAX Protocol 10 was a single-blind, randomised, single-centre study of 4 formulations of 
Haemophilus  influenzae  type  b/  hepatitis  B  combination  vaccine  to  probe  the  immunogenicity  of 
varying PRP dosage (0.5 µg, 1.0 µg, 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg (licensed formulation) in combination with 5 
µg HBsAg. South African infants (4 to 8 weeks of age) were randomised to receive one of the four 
formulations. The formulations  1.0  µg  and  7.5 µg PRP did  not  contain thiomersal.  The preparations 
0.5  µg  and  3.75  µg  were  prepared  as  field  mixes  and  contained  11.48  µg  thiomersal/  0.5  ml  dose 
which is approximately half of the amount of in the paediatric formulation of the licensed monovalent 
hepatitis B vaccine, HBVAX. The vaccine formulations were administered at 6, 10, 14 and 36 weeks 
of age. Serum samples were obtained prior to and 4 weeks following dose 3 and prior to and 4 weeks 
following dose 4. Safety data were collected for 14 days following each dose of the study vaccine. The 
study  was  intended  for  infants  born  to  non-carrier  mothers.  Between  51  and  53  vaccinees  were 
enrolled per group. 
As shown in the table, the anti-HBs responses (%≥ 10 mIU/mL and GMTs) appeared similar for the 
PRP dosage ranged from 0.5 µg to 3.75 µg with a very slight trend towards a lower immune response 
of the 1.0 µg formulation. After dose 4, 100 % of these subjects developed an anti- HBs response of 10 
mIU/mL  with  GMTs  ranging  from  3177.2  mIU/mL  to  3390.3  mIU/mL.  However,  the  anti-HBs 
responses to the formulation with 7.5  µg PRP (thiomersal-free)  appeared decreased compared to the 
other formulations. The post dose 4 anti-HBs response was 97.6 % with a GMT of 1566.2 mIU/mL.

Notably, the formulations with 3.75 µg and 7.5 µg PRP appeared to be modestly more immunogenic 
after dose 3 than the formulations with lower PRP dosages. After dose 4, no clear dose effect could be 
observed. The applicant concluded that the GMT of the  7.5 µg formulation was less robust than the 
GMTs of the other formulations and that the trends observed seem consistent with a PRP dose effect 
as opposed to a thiomersal effect. 
Interestingly, there were 4 infants (three in the groups with thiomersal-free hepatitis B vaccine) born 
to HBsAg positive mothers who were tested HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative at 40 weeks of age.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
High risk infants 
The  NYCDH  data  do  not  indicate  that  the  introduction  and  use  of  the  thiomersal  free  monovalent 
hepatitis B vaccine has a negative impact on the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent HBV infection 
in a public health setting. However, the surveillance data are considered to be limited and subject of 
several  biases  (see  CPMP/4167/00  adopted).  Of  some  concern  are  the  3  infants  who  remained  anti-
HBsAg negative despite regular vaccination with the thiomersal-free hepatitis B vaccine (period 2). 
A valid classification of the mothers’ HBsAg status derived from the NYCDOH has not been possible 
due to the limited number of infants for which serological data could be obtained. 
Extrapolated studies 
Data from HEXAVAC and PROCOMVAX clinical documentation indicate  
• 
a decrease of the immune response of anti-HBs with regard to lower GMTs  
• 
a lower percentage of infants ≥ 10 mIU/mL just prior to the booster  
Compared to the monovalent, thiomersal-containing, Hepatitis B vaccine. 
Although there is no  evidence that  the  thiomersal free  vaccine  would  be less immunogenic than the 
thiomersal  containing  vaccine,  clinical  data  from  PROCOMVAX  and  HEXAVAC  suggest  a  lower 
immune  response  of  the  hepatitis  B  component  of  the  vaccines.  Whether  this  is  a  result  of  an 
interaction  with  the  Hib-component  of  the  vaccines  or  due  to  the  omission  of  thiomersal  in  the 
finished product is at present not known.  
Although  the  PROCOMVAX  study  is  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  variable  PRP  dosage,  variable 
thiomersal- content, low sample size per group and the different vaccination schedule it could suggest 
that there is both a PRP dose and a thiomersal effect in terms of a decrease of the immune response. If 
a possible lower immune response is only caused by an interaction with the PRP component or is also 
the  result  of  the  avoidance  of  thiomersal  in  the  bulk  alum  product  (BAP)  of  the  HBsAg  used  in 
HEXAVAC and PROCOMVAX, is not known at present. 
A possible lower immune response in infants and toddlers as seen within those combination vaccines 
is not considered to be of clinical relevance because infants and toddlers in the EU are not considered 
to be at high risk immediately after vaccination. However, the results raised some concern with regard 
to  the  persistence  of  the  immune  response.  Notably,  the  immunogenicity  data  obtained  with 
PROCOMVAX and HEXAVAC are from infants in their first and second year of life. It is not clear to 
what extent potential reduced immunogenicity of the thiomersal-free, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine 
may  affect  pre-maturely  born  infants,  adolescents,  adults,  older  persons,  persons  at  risk  and  (pre) 
dialysis  patients  since  no  hard  clinical  efficacy/  immunogenicity  data  for  the  thiomersal-free 
formulation are provided for these populations.  
For  all  reasons  stated  above,  the  proposed  clinical  study  in  younger  adults  is  deemed  necessary  to 
adequately answer the question of comparability of the thiomersal- free hepatitis B vaccine with the 
currently licensed vaccine.

Clinical safety

Post-marketing safety data of the thiomersal-free vaccine in the U.S. 
The company’s database was queried to determine if there is any difference in the number and type of 
reported suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) with the thiomersal-containing and the thiomersal-
free formulation of the applicant’s hepatitis B vaccine (RECOMBIVAX). The time periods between 1 
January 1999 to 31 August 1999 and 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2000 was chosen because they best 
reflect  the  reporting  AEs  with  thiomersal-containing  and  thiomersal-free  RECOMBIVAX  HB 
formulations,  respectively.  Thiomersal-free  RECOMBIVAX  HB  has  been  approval  by  the  FDA  in 
August  1999.  All  adverse  experiences  reported  in  patients  less  than  20  years  with  reported 
RECOMBIVAX  HB  lot  number  were  identified.  These  inclusion  criteria  were  selected  because 
persons under 20 years are most likely to have received thiomersal-free hepatitis B vaccine. Notably, 
in 2000 both hepatitis B formulations were on parallel on the US market. The data are shown in Table 
5: 
Overview  of  spontaneous  ADR  reports  between  the  thiomersal-containing  and  thiomersal-free 
hepatitis B vaccine in the US.

The applicant concluded that the number of suspected ADR in the WAES database are low and that 
the  data  provide  evidence  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  number  and  type  of  reported  adverse 
experiences  following  the  administration  of  the  sponsors  monovalent  thiomersal-free  vaccine  is 
different from the recent formulation.

Post-Marketing Safety Study of PROCOMVAX 
Post-Marketing Safety Study of PROCOMVAX 
PROCOMVAX  Protocol  012,  entitled  ”Post  Marketing  Evaluation  of  the  Short  Term  Safety  of 
COMVAX,”  assesses  uncommon  adverse  experiences  (i.e.,  those  that  might  not  be  detected  during 
pre-licensure  clinical  trials),  which  could  be  associated  with  this  thiomersal-free,  hepatitis  B-
containing combination vaccine. The study is being conducted at Group Health Cooperative of Puget 
Sound (GHC), a managed care plan that provides medical care for over 530,000 children and adults in 
Washington  State.  Study  methods  involve  comparing  adverse  experience  rates,  as  measured  by 
diagnostic  codes  for  hospital,  emergency  room,  or  outpatient  visits,  during  different  time  periods 
following vaccination.  Two types of  control  groups are presented in this study: self-comparison and 
historical.  For  the  self-comparison  control,  the  rates  of  medical  events  related  to  PROCOMVAX 
occurring in the 0, 1 to 5, 6 to 14, and 0 to 30 day risk periods were compared to the rate of the same 
clinical events occurring  in a  comparison time  period 31 to  60  days post  vaccination. The  historical 
control  group  matches  children  who  received  Hib  conjugate  vaccine  in  the  2  years  prior  to  the 
introduction  of  PROCOMVAX  at  GHC  (Jul-1995  to  Jul-1997)  to  recipients  of  PROCOMVAX 
according to birth month, shot month, and shot number. The rates of medical events occurring in the 0, 
1  to  5,  6  to  14,  and  0  to  30  day  risk  periods  for  PROCOMVAX  were  compared  to  the  same  time 
windows following Hib vaccination. A total of 11,680 doses of PROCOMVAX were administered to 
children 6 weeks to 36 months of age between Jul-1997 and Feb-1999. Of these, 6206 doses were first 
doses of PROCOMVAX, 4485 were second doses, and 979 were third doses. The analyses identified 4 
main categories of elevated relative risks that were statistically significant at the p<0.05 level:  
”Respiratory Abnormality, Not Elsewhere Coded” (Days 6 to 14 post-vaccination 1 and 2);  
”Non-infectious Gastroenteritis” (Days 1 to 5 post-vaccination 3) and  
”Viral Enteritis” (Days 6 to 14 post-vaccination 2);  
8/10 
EMEA 2005   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
”Unspecified  Adverse  Effect  of  Drug,  Medicinal,  and  Biological  Substance  (Days  1  to  5  post-
vaccination 2);”  
and ”Pyrexia Unknown Origin” (Days 6 to 14 post-vaccination 1 and 3).  
There were two categories with significantly decreased relative risks at the p<0.05 level:  
”Convulsions (Days 6 to 14 post-vaccination 1)” and  
”Non-infectious gastroenteritis (Days 6 to 14 post-vaccination 2).”  
Specifically with respect to pyrexia (14/ 5703 infants), there was an increased rate of outpatient visits 
6 to 14 days following shot 1 in the outpatient setting versus the historical control group but not versus 
the  self-comparison  group.  There  were  no  increased  risks  for  serious  adverse  outcomes  associated 
with  pyrexia,  such  as  emergency  department  visits  or  hospitalisation.  Furthermore,  there  was  no 
increased  risk  of  outpatient  visits  for  pyrexia  following  shot  2  or  shot  3  compared  to  the  historical 
control group. PROCOMVAX was associated with an increased rate for pyrexia 6-14 days after shot 3 
compared to the self-comparison group but not when compared to the historical control group. Since 
shot  3  is  generally  given  concomitantly  with  M-M-R®II  at  approximately  15  months  of  age,  the 
analysis was stratified by concomitant M-M-R®II administration. Among children who received M-
M-R®II  with PROCOMVAX, there was an increased risk of outpatient  visits  for  pyrexia 6-14  days 
after shot 3 compared to self comparison, but not when compared to historical controls. This suggests 
that  the  increased  risk  was  due  to  concomitant  M-M-R®II  administration.  Among  children  who 
received  PROCOMVAX  without  M-M-R®II  at  shot  3,  there  was  no  statistically  increased  risk  of 
health care visits for pyrexia. 
While  the  data  from  this  post-marketing  study  are  preliminary,  they  reconfirm  the  excellent  safety 
profile  of  the  thiomersal-free  vaccine  PROCOMVAX  and,  by  extension,  the  thiomersal-free 
monovalent hepatitis B vaccine. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The PROCOMVAX-study revealed no evidence of any new safety signal but the data are considered 
preliminary and reporting will be continued. 
The selection criteria for the analysis of spontaneous ADR reports have been accepted but the safety 
data  provided  for  the  thiomersal  –free  hepatitis  B  vaccines  are  considered  limited  and  will  be  dealt 
with in an active PMS program.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Batch to batch consistency has been documented and the relevant tests will be performed according to 
the agreed specifications. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall,  the  toxicology  programme  revealed  that  the  thiomersal  free  Hepatitis  B  vaccine  can  be 
considered safe and immunogenic. Extrapolated study results from other thiomersal free vaccines have 
shown  no  acute  and  repeated  dose  toxicity.  Animal  reproduction  studies  have  not  been  conducted. 
This information has been included in the SPC. 
Efficacy and safety 
Since  no  formal  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  thiomersal  free  vaccine,  the  proposed  post-
licensure,  randomised,  double-blind  study  comparing  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  thiomersal-
free  and  thiomersal-containing  monovalent  hepatitis  B  vaccines  in  healthy  adolescents  and  younger

adults (16 to 35 years of age) is considered to be of inherent importance to ensure that the thiomersal-
free vaccine is not-inferior to the thiomersal-containing vaccine.  
Immunogenicity data obtained from the HEXAVAC and the PROCOMVAX file can be linked to the 
new application for infants (< 2 months of age) and toddlers. For ethical reasons no additional trial is 
deemed necessary in this particular age groups. 
In the light of the conclusion of the CPMP (CPMP/4167/00 adopted) that there should be no further 
delay  to  provide  the  vaccine  to  the  EU  population  taking  into  account  the  public  health  interests 
regarding thiomersal-free vaccines and the fact that no negative experiences with HBVAXPRO given 
to infants at risk in the U.S. the benefit/risk ratio is considered positive. 
Safety 
An active PMS program including surveillance on both effectiveness and safety of the thiomersal free 
vaccine is considered necessary.  
Benefit/risk assessment 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CPMP  concluded  that  the 
benefit/risk  profile  of  HBVAXPRO  in  the  prophylaxis  of  Hepatitis  B  infection  was  favourable  and 
therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

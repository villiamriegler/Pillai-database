VEYVONDI 1300 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
VEYVONDI 650 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection 
Each vial of powder contains nominally 650 International Units (IU) vonicog alfa. 
After reconstitution with the 5 mL solvent provided, VEYVONDI contains approximately 130 IU/mL 
vonicog alfa. 
VEYVONDI 1300 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection 
Each vial of powder contains nominally 1300 International Units (IU) vonicog alfa. 
After reconstitution with the 10 mL solvent provided, VEYVONDI contains approximately 130 IU/mL 
vonicog alfa. 
The specific activity of VEYVONDI is approximately 110 IU VWF:RCo/mg protein. 
The potency of VWF (IU) is measured using the European Pharmacopeia ristocetin cofactor activity 
assay (VWF: RCo). The ristocetin cofactor activity of recombinant human von Willebrand factor was 
determined against the International Standard for von Willebrand factor concentrate (WHO). 
Vonicog alfa is a purified recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF). It is manufactured by 
recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line without the 
addition of any exogenous human-or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, purification or 
final formulation.  
The product contains only trace amounts of human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (≤ 0.01 IU 
FVIII / IU VWF: RCo) as determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay for 
factor VIII (FVIII).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prevention and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in adults (age 18 years and older) with 
von Willebrand disease (VWD), when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or 
contraindicated. 
VEYVONDI should not be used in the treatment of haemophilia A. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD) should be supervised by a physician experienced in the 
treatment of haemostatic disorders.  
Posology 
Dose and frequency of administration must be individualized according to clinical judgement and 
based on the patient´s weight, type and severity of the bleeding episodes/surgical intervention and 
based on monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. Dose based on bodyweight may 
require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. 
Generally, 1 IU/kg (VWF:RCo/VEYVONDI/vonicog alfa) raises the plasma VWF:RCo by 
0.02 IU/mL (2%). 
Haemostasis cannot be ensured until Factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) is at least 0.4 IU/mL 
(≥ 40% of normal activity). Depending on the patient’s baseline FVIII:C levels, a single infusion of 
rVWF will, in a majority of patients, lead to an increase above 40% in endogenous FVIII:C activity 
within 6 hours and will result in sustaining this level up to 72 hours post infusion. The dose and 
duration of the treatment depend on the clinical status of the patient, the type and severity of the 
bleeding, and both VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels. If the patient’s baseline plasma FVIII:C level is 
< 40% or is unknown and in all situations where a rapid correction of haemostasis should be achieved, 
such as treatment of an acute haemorrhage, severe trauma or emergency surgery, it is necessary to 
administer a recombinant factor VIII product with the first infusion of VEYVONDI, in order to 
achieve a haemostatic plasma level of FVIII:C. 
However, if an immediate rise in FVIII:C is not necessary, or if the baseline FVIII:C level is sufficient 
to ensure haemostasis, the physician may decide to omit the co-administration of rFVIII at the first 
infusion with VEYVONDI. 
In case of major bleeding events or major surgeries requiring repeated, frequent infusions, monitoring 
of FVIII:C levels is recommended, to decide if rFVIII is required for subsequent infusions to avoid 
excessive rise of FVIII:C. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes (On-demand treatment) 
Start of treatment: 
The first dose of VEYVONDI should be 40 to 80 IU/kg body weight. Replacement levels of 
VWF:RCo > 0.6 IU/mL (60%) and FVIII:C > 0.4 IU/mL (40%) should be achieved. Dosing guidelines 
for treatment of minor and major haemorrhages are provided in Table 1. 
VEYVONDI should be administered with recombinant factor VIII if the FVIII:C levels are < 40%, or 
are unknown, to control bleeding. The rFVIII dose should be calculated according to the difference 
between the patient’s baseline plasma FVIII:C level, and the desired peak FVIII:C level to achieve an 
appropriate plasma FVIII:C level based on the approximate mean recovery of 0.02 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). 
The complete dose of VEYVONDI should be administered followed by rFVIII within 10 minutes. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Calculating dose: 
VEYVONDI dose [IU] = dose [IU/kg] x body weight [kg] 
Subsequent infusions: 
A subsequent dose of 40 IU to 60 IU/kg of VEYVONDI should be infused every 8 to 24 hours as per 
the dosing ranges in Table 1, or as long as clinically appropriate. In major bleeding episodes, maintain 
trough levels of VWF:RCo greater than 50% for as long as deemed necessary. 
Based on experience from clinical trials, once VWF has been replaced, endogenous FVIII levels will 
remain normal or near normal as long as VEYVONDI is continued to be administered.

bA bleed could be considered major if red blood cell transfusion is either required or potentially indicated or if 
bleeding occurs in a critical anatomical site (e.g., intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage). 
Prevention of bleeding/haemorrhage and treatment in case of elective surgery 
Prior to surgery: 
In patients with inadequate levels of FVIII, a dose of 40-60 IU/kg VEYVONDI should be 
administered 12-24 hours prior to initiating elective surgery (pre-operative dose), to ensure pre-
operative endogenous FVIII levels of at least 0.4 IU/mL for minor and at least 0.8 IU/mL for major 
surgery. 
For prevention of excessive bleeding in case of elective surgery, within 3 hours prior to initiation of 
any surgical procedure, the FVIII:C levels should be assessed. If the FVIII:C levels are at the 
recommended target level of:  
-  at least 0.4 IU/mL for minor and oral surgery and 
-  at least 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery, 
a dose of VEYVONDI alone should be administered within 1 hour prior to the procedure.  
If the FVIII:C levels are not at the recommended target levels, rFVIII should be administered in 
addition to vonicog alfa to raise VWF:RCo and FVIII:C, within 1 hour prior to the procedure. Please 
refer to Table 2 for FVIII:C recommended target levels. The dose depends on VWF and FVIII levels 
of the patient, the type and severity of the expected bleeding.

During and after surgery: 
After the initiation of the surgical procedure, the VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels should be 
monitored and the intra- and post-operative substitution regimen should be individualised according to 
the PK results, intensity and duration of the haemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of 
care. In general, the frequency of VEYVONDI dosing for post-operative substitution should range 
from twice a day to every 48 hours. Please refer to Table 3 for treatment recommendations for 
subsequent maintenance doses.

Prophylactic treatment 
For initiation of long-term prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with VWD, doses of 40 to 60 IU/kg 
of VEYVONDI administered twice weekly should be considered. Depending on the patient’s 
condition and clinical response, including breakthrough bleeds, higher doses (not exceeding 80 IU/kg) 
and/or an increased dose frequency (up to three times per week) may be required. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of VEYVONDI in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available.  
Method of administration 
VEYVONDI is for intravenous use. The reconstituted product should be inspected visually prior to 
administration.  
The rate of administration should be slow enough to ensure the comfort of the patient, up to a 
maximum of 4 mL/min. The patient should be observed for any immediate reaction. If any reaction, 
such as tachycardia, occurs that might be related to the administration of the product, the rate of 
infusion should be reduced or stopped as required by the clinical condition of the patient.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Known allergic reaction to mouse or hamster proteins. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
In actively bleeding patients it is recommended to co-administer a FVIII product with VEYVONDI as 
a first line treatment and depending on the FVIII activity levels (see section 4.2). 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) have occurred. Patients and/or their caregivers 
should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, which may include but are not 
limited to tachycardia, tightness of the chest, wheezing and/or acute respiratory distress, hypotension, 
generalised urticaria, pruritus, rhinoconjunctivitis, angioedema, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, 
paresthesia, restlessness, and may progress to anaphylactic shock. In case of shock, standard medical 
treatment for shock should be implemented.  
Patients should be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion 
period. If signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue 
administration of VEYVONDI and provide appropriate supportive care. 
Adequate medical treatment and provisions should be available for immediate use for a potential 
anaphylactic reaction, especially for patients with a history of allergic reactions. 
VEYVONDI contains trace amounts of mouse immunoglobulin G (MuIgG) and Hamster proteins 
(less than or equal to 2 ng/IU VEYVONDI). Patients treated with this product may develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to these non-human mammalian proteins. VEYVONDI contains trace 
amounts of recombinant coagulation factor VIII.  
Thrombosis and embolism 
There is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly in patients with known clinical or 
laboratory risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, patients at risk 
have to be monitored for early signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against 
thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care.  
In patients requiring frequent doses of VEYVONDI in combination with recombinant factor VIII, 
plasma level for FVIII:C activity should be monitored to avoid sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma 
level, which may increase the risk of thrombotic events. 
Any FVIII that would be administered along with VEYVONDI should be a pure FVIII product. A 
combination with a FVIII product containing VWF would pose an additional risk of thrombotic 
events.

Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) 
Patients with VWD, especially Type 3, may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to von 
Willebrand factor. If the expected plasma level of (VWF:RCo) is not attained, or if bleeding is not 
controlled with an appropriate dose, an appropriate assay should be performed to determine if a von 
Willebrand factor inhibitor is present. In patients with high levels of anti-VWF neutralising antibodies, 
von Willebrand factor therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered 
to establish haemostasis. 
Treatment of VWD patients who have high-titer binding antibodies (due to previous treatment with 
pdVWF) may require a higher dose to overcome the binding antibody effect and such patients could 
be managed clinically by administration of higher doses of vonicog alfa based on the PK data for each 
individual patient. 
Excipient related considerations 
This medicinal product contains 5.2 mg sodium in each 650 IU vial or 10.4 mg sodium in each 
1300 IU vial, equivalent to 2.2% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for 
an adult, assuming a body weight of 70 kg and a dose of 80 IU/kg body weight. This is to be taken into 
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of human von Willebrand factor products with other medicinal products are known. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with VEYVONDI. 
Pregnancy 
Experience in the treatment of pregnant or breast-feeding women is not available. VEYVONDI should 
be administered to pregnant woment only if clearly indicated, taking into consideration that delivery 
confers an increased risk of haemorrhagic events in these patients. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether VEYVONDI is excreted in human milk.Therefore, VEYVONDI should be 
administered to lactating von Willebrand factor deficient women only if clearly indicated. Healthcare 
professionals should balance the potential risks and only prescribe VEYVONDI if needed 
Fertility 
The effects of VEYVONDI on fertility have not been established. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
VEYVONDI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
During treatment with VEYVONDI the following adverse reactions may occur: 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, thromboembolic events, inhibitor formation against VWF.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In clinical trials, one case of clinically asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported for a 
subject in the surgery study who had total hip replacement. 
In addition, one post-marketing case of DVT has been reported spontaneously for an elderly patient. 
Hypersensitivity 
There is a possibility of developing hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include 
angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, rhinoconjunctivitis, generalised 
urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) which may in some cases progress to anaphylaxis (including 
shock). 
Patients with von Willebrand disease, especially Type 3, may very rarely develop neutralising 
antibodies (inhibitors) to von Willebrand factor. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest 
itself as an inadequate clinical response. Such antibodies may occur in close association with 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing hypersensitivity or 
anaphylactic reactions should be tested and evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. 
In all such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. 
Thrombogenicity 
There is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events, particularly in patients with known clinical or 
laboratory risk factors including low ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, patients at risk have to be 
monitored for early signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should 
be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care.  
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of VEYVONDI was assessed in clinical trials by monitoring the development of 
neutralizing antibodies against VWF and FVIII, as well as binding antibodies against VWF, Furin, 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) protein and mouse IgG. No treatment-emergent development of 
neutralizing antibodies against human VWF or neutralizing antibodies against human rFVIII was 
observed. One of the 100 subjects who received VEYVONDI peri-operatively in clinical trials 
developed treatment-emergent binding antibodies against VWF following a surgery for whom no 
adverse events or lack of haemostatic efficacy has been reported. Binding antibodies against impurities 
such as rFurin, CHO-protein or mouse IgG were not observed after treatment with VEYVONDI. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No symptoms of overdose with von Willebrand factor have been reported. Thromboembolic events 
may occur in case of major overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor von Willebrand factor, ATC 
code: B02BD10 
Mechanism of action 
VEYVONDI is a recombinant human von Willebrand factor (rVWF). VEYVONDI behaves in the 
same way as endogenous von Willebrand factor. 
Administration of VEYVONDI allows correction of the haemostatic abnormalities exhibited by 
patients who suffer from von Willebrand factor deficiency (von Willebrand's disease) at two levels: 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
VEYVONDI re-establishes platelet adhesion to the vascular sub-endothelium at the site of 
vascular damage (as it binds both to the vascular sub-endothelium matrix (e.g. collagen) and to 
the platelet membrane), providing primary haemostasis as shown by the shortening of the 
bleeding time. This effect occurs immediately and is known to depend to a large extent on the 
level of polymerisation of the protein. 
VEYVONDI produces delayed correction of the associated factor VIII deficiency. Administered 
intravenously, VEYVONDI binds to endogenous factor VIII (which is produced normally by the 
patient), and by stabilising this factor, avoids its rapid degradation. Because of this, 
administration of VEYVONDI restores the FVIII:C level to normal as a secondary effect. After 
the first infusion, the FVIII:C level is expected to rise above 40% within 6 hours and to peak 
within 24 hours in most patients, depending on the baseline FVIII:C level. 
VEYVONDI is a rVWF that contains ultra-large multimers in addition to all of the multimers found in 
plasma as it is not exposed to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 during the manufacturing process. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical safety, efficacy and PK data were assessed in 4 completed trials, (070701, 071001, 071101 
and 071301) which enrolled patients with VWD. A total of 112 unique subjects (100 unique subjects 
with VWD in studies 070701, 071001, 071101 and 071301, and 12 subjects with haemophilia A in 
study 071104) were exposed to VEYVONDI during clinical development. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
VEYVONDI in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of von Willebrand Disease (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of VEYVONDI were determined in three clinical trials by assessing the 
plasma levels of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand Factor Antigen (VWF:Ag), and von Willebrand Collagen 
Binding Activity (VWF:CB). In all three studies, subjects were evaluated in the non-bleeding state. 
Sustained increase of FVIII:C was observed by six hours after a single infusion of VEYVONDI.  
Table 5 summarizes the PK of VEYVONDI after 50 IU/kg VWR:RCo (PK50) or 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo 
(PK80) infusions. The mean duration of infusion was 16.5 minutes (SD ± 3.51 minutes) for 50 IU/kg 
(PK50) and 11.8 minutes (± 2.86 minutes) for 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo (PK80).

An exploratory analysis of combined data from studies 070701 and 071001 indicated a statistically 
significantly (at the 5% level) longer mean residence time, a statistically significantly (at the 5% level) 
longer terminal half-life and statistically significantly (at the 5% level) larger AUC0-inf regarding 
VWF:RCo following administration with VEYVONDI (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo) and combined 
administration of VEYVONDI and octocog alfa (50 IU/kg VWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg rFVIII) than 
after administration of pdVWF and pdFVIII (50 IU/kg pdVWF:RCo and 38.5 IU/kg pdFVIII).  
In addition, full PK assessments of VEYVONDI were performed following single and multiple dosing 
in Study 071301, which investigated long-term prophylactic treatment in a total of 23 subjects with 
severe VWD (N=3 type 1, N=1 type 2A, N=1 type 2B, N=18 type 3). PK parameters derived from 
these assessment confirmed the results of previous trials (see Table 5 above) and a statistical 
comparison of key VWF PK parameters between initiation and month 12 of prophylactic treatment did 
not reveal any significant differences. 
PK data of VWF (N=100) across the different studies were evaluated using a population PK modelling 
and simulation approach. These results confirmed that the PK of VWF:RCo is both dose-independent 
(range: 2.0 to 80 IU/kg) and time-independent (up to 1.5 years). Covariate evaluations indicated no 
clinically meaningful effect of gender and race on VWF:RCo PK; body weight was identified as a 
significant covariate. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development. 
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and fetal development have been conducted. 
In a human ex vivo placenta perfusion model, it has been demonstrated that VEYVONDI does not 
cross the human placenta barrier.

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Check the expiry date, and ensure that the VEYVONDI powder and water for injections 
(solvent) are at room temperature prior to preparation. Do not use after the expiry date stated on 
the labels and carton. 
Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the 
reconstitution procedure. Wash your hands and put on clean exam gloves (the use of gloves is 
optional). 
Use the reconstituted product (after mixing the powder with the supplied water) as soon as 
possible and within three hours. You can store the reconstituted product at room temperature not 
to exceed 25 °C for up to three hours. 
Ensure that the VEYVONDI powder vial and the sterilised water for injections (solvent) are at 
room temperature prior to preparation. 
Use plastic syringes with this product because proteins in the product tend to stick to the surface 
of glass syringes.

Do not mix vonicog alfa with other medicinal products except for octocog alfa (ADVATE). 
Instructions for reconstitution and application 
1  Remove the caps from the VEYVONDI powder and solvent 
vials to expose the centre of the rubber stoppers. 
Steps 
Image example 
NA 
2  Disinfect each stopper with a separate sterile alcohol swab (or 
other suitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or 
haemophilia treatment centre) by wiping the stopper for 
several seconds. Allow the rubber stopper to dry. Place the 
vials on a flat surface. 
3  Open the Mix2Vial device package by completely peeling 
away the lid, without touching the inside of the package. Do 
not remove the Mix2Vial device from the package. 
4  Turn the package with the Mix2Vial device upside down and 
place it over the top of the solvent vial. Firmly insert the blue 
plastic spike of the device into the centre of the solvent vial 
stopper by pushing straight down. Grip the package at its edge 
and lift it off the Mix2Vial device. Be careful not to touch the 
clear plastic spike. The solvent vial now has the Mix2Vial 
device connected to it and is ready to be connected to the 
VEYVONDI vial. 
5  To connect the solvent vial to the VEYVONDI vial, turn the 
solvent vial over and place it on top of the vial containing 
VEYVONDI powder. Fully insert the clear plastic spike into 
the VEYVONDI vial stopper by firmly pushing straight down. 
This should be done right away to keep the liquid free of 
germs. The solvent will flow into the VEYVONDI vial by 
vacuum. Check that all the solvent has transferred. Do not use 
if the vacuum has been lost and the solvent does not flow into 
the VEYVONDI vial. 
6  Gently and continuously swirl the connected vials or allow the 
reconstituted product to stand for 5 minutes then gently swirl 
to ensure the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake. 
Shaking will adversely affect the product. Do not refrigerate 
after reconstitution. 
7  Disconnect the two sides of the Mix2Vial from each other by 
holding the clear plastic side of the Mix2Vial device attached 
to the VEYVONDI vial with one hand and the blue plastic 
side of the Mix2Vial device attached to the solvent vial with 
the other hand. Turn the blue plastic side counterclockwise 
and gently pull the two vials apart. Do not touch the end of the 
plastic connector attached to the VEYVONDI vial containing 
the dissolved product. Place the VEYVONDI vial on a flat 
work surface. Discard the empty solvent vial. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps 
Image example 
8  Draw air into the empty, sterile disposable plastic syringe by 
pulling back on the plunger. The amount of air should equal 
the amount of reconstituted VEYVONDI that you will 
withdraw from the vial. 
9  Leaving the VEYVONDI vial (containing the reconsituted 
product) on your flat work surface, connect the syringe to the 
clear plastic connector and turning the syringe clockwise. 
10  Hold the vial with one hand and use the other hand to push all 
the air from the syringe into the vial.  
11  Flip connected syringe and VEYVONDI vial so the vial is on 
top. Be sure to keep the syringe plunger pressed in. Draw the 
VEYVONDI into the syringe by pulling plunger back slowly. 
12  Do not push and pull solution back and forth between syringe 
and vial. Doing so may harm medicine. When ready to infuse, 
disconnect the syringe by turning it counterclockwise. Inspect 
the syringe visually for particulate matter; the solution should 
be clear and colourless. If flakes or particles are seen, do not 
use the solution and notify your doctor. 
13 
If you need more than one vial of VEYVONDI to make up 
your dose: 
  Leave the syringe attached to the vial until an 
additional vial is prepared. 
  Use the reconstitution steps above (2 to 8) to prepare 
the additional vial of VEYVONDI using a fresh 
Mix2Vial device for each vial.  
14  The contents of two vials may be drawn into a single syringe.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps 
NOTE: When pushing air into a second vial of VEYVONDI 
to be pooled into a syringe, orient the vial and connected 
syringe with the vial on top. 
Image example 
Instructions for administration 
Inspect the prepared solution in the syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from particles). It is not uncommon 
for a few flakes or particles to remain in the product vial after reconstitution. The filter included in 
the Mix2Vial device removes those particles completely. Filtration does not influence dose 
calculations. The solution in the syringe should not be used if it is cloudy or contains flakes or 
particles after filtration.

4. 
Attach the infusion needle to a syringe containing VEYVONDI solution. For comfort, a winged 
(butterfly) infusion set is preferred. Point the needle up and remove any air bubbles by gently 
tapping the syringe with your finger and slowly and carefully pushing air out of the syringe and 
needle. 
Apply a tourniquet and get the infusion site ready by wiping the skin well with a sterile alcohol 
swab (or other suitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or haemophilia treatment 
centre). 
Insert the needle into the vein and remove the tourniquet. Slowly infuse VEYVONDI. Do not 
infuse any faster than 4 mL per minute. Disconnect the empty syringe. If your dose requires 
multiple syringes, attach and administer each additional syringe of VEYVONDI one at a time. 
Note:  
Do not remove butterfly needle until all syringes have been infused and do not touch the Luer 
port that connects to the syringe. 
If recombinant factor VIII has been prescribed, administer recombinant factor VIII within 
10 minutes after infusion of VEYVONDI has been completed. 
Take the needle out of the vein and use sterile gauze to put pressure on the infusion site for 
several minutes. 
In case large volumes of VEYVONDI are required, it is possible to pool two vials of VEYVONDI 
together. The contents of each reconstituted product of VEYVONDI can be drawn in a single syringe. 
However, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution of VEYVONDI should not be diluted any 
further. 
The solution should be slowly administered intravenously (see section 4.2) not exceeding 4 mL/min. 
Do not recap the needle. Place the needle, syringe, and empty VEYVONDI and solvent vial(s) in a 
hard-walled sharps container for proper disposal. Do not dispose of these supplies in ordinary 
household trash. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What VEYVONDI is and what it is used for 
VEYVONDI contains the active substance vonicog alfa, which is a recombinant human von 
Willebrand factor (rVWF). It behaves in the same way as natural human von Willebrand factor (VWF) 
in the body. VWF is the carrier molecule for coagulation factor VIII and is involved in blood clotting 
making platelets stick to wounds and so helps to form a blood clot. Lack of VWF increases the 
tendency to bleed. 
VEYVONDI is used to prevent and treat bleeding episodes, including bleeding during surgery, in adult 
patients (aged 18 years and older) with von Willebrand disease. It is used when treatment with another 
medicine, desmopressin, is not effective or cannot be given. 
Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by the lack or an insufficient amount 
of von Willebrand factor. In patients with the disease the blood does not clot normally leading to a 
prolonged bleeding time. Administration of von Willebrand factor (VWF) allows for correction of von 
Willebrand factor deficiency. 
2.  What you need to know before you use VEYVONDI  
Do not use VEYVONDI 
- 
if you are allergic to vonicog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins 
- 
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using VEYVONDI.  
There is a  risk that you may experience a hypersensitivity reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction) 
to VEYVONDI. Your doctor should inform you about early signs of severe allergic reactions such as 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased heart rate, rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in 
breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, fast heartbeat, stuffy nose, red eyes,general feeling of 
being unwell, and dizziness. These could be early symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If any of 
these symptoms occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor. Severe symptoms, 
including difficulty in breathing and dizziness, require prompt emergency treatment. 
Patients developing inhibitors 
Inhibitors (antibodies) against the VWF may occur in some patients receiving the medicine.These 
inhibitors, especially at high levels, could cause the treatment to stop working properly. You will be 
monitored carefully for the possibility of having developed these inhibitors. 
- 
If your bleeding is not controlled with VEYVONDI, tell your doctor immediately. 
If your plasma VWF or factor VIII fail to reach the expected levels with VEYVONDI based on the test 
results followed by your doctor, or if bleeding is not adequately controlled, it could be due to the 
presence of VWF or factor VIII antibodies. This will be checked by your doctor. You might need a 
higher dose of VEYVONDI, or a higher dose of factor VIII, or even a different medicine to control 
bleedings. Do not increase the total dose of VEYVONDI to control your bleeding without consulting 
your doctor. 
If you have previously been treated with plasma-derived VWF concentrates you may have reduced 
response to VEYVONDI due to pre-existing antibodies. Your doctor may adjust the dose according to 
your laboratory results.  
Thrombolism and embolism 
There is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic events if you have known clinical or laboratory risk 
factors. Therefore your doctor will monitor you for early signs of thrombosis. 
FVIII products may contain varying amounts of VWF. Therefore, any FVIII product that would be 
administered in combination with VEYVONDI should be a pure FVIII product.  
If you previously had problems with blood clots or vessel occlusion (thromboembolic complications), 
tell your doctor immediately. 
Children and adolescents 
VEYVONDI is not approved for use in children or adolescents below 18 years. 
Other medicines and VEYVONDI 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
VEYVONDI is not likely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  
VEYVONDI contains sodium 
This medicine contains 5.2 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 650 IU vial or 
10.4 mg sodium in each 1300 IU vial. 
This is equivalent to 2.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult, 
assuming 70 kg body weight and 80 IU/kg body weight. 
This should be taken into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet.

3. 
How to use VEYVONDI 
Your treatment with VEYVONDI will be supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the care of 
patients with von Willebrand disease.  
Your doctor will calculate your dose of VEYVONDI (in international units or IU). The dose depends 
on: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
body weight,  
the site of the bleeding 
intensity of the bleeding,  
your clinical condition,  
the required surgery  
the VWF activity levels in your blood after surgery  
the severity of your disease 
Your doctor may test your blood to make sure that you have adequate levels of von Willebrand factor. 
This is particularly important if you are having major surgery. 
Treatment of bleeding episodes 
Your doctor will calculate the dose that is most appropriate for you, how often you should receive 
VEYVONDI and for how long.  
For minor bleeding (e.g. nose bleed, oral bleeding, menorrhagia), each initial dose is usually 40 to 
50 IU/kg and for major bleeding (severe or refractory nose bleed, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, Central nervous system trauma, haemarthrosis, or traumatic haemorrhage), each initial dose 
is 50 to 80 IU/kg. Subsequent doses (as clinically required) are 40 to 50 IU/kg every 8 to 24 hours for 
minor bleeds as long as deemed clinically necessary and for major bleeds 40 to 60 IU/kg for 
approximately 2-3 days. 
If you feel that VEYVONDI is not working well enough, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will perform 
tests to make sure that you have adequate levels of von Willebrand factor. If you use VEYVONDI at 
home, your doctor will make sure that you are shown how to infuse it and how much to use. 
Prevention of bleeding in case of elective surgery 
For prevention of excessive bleeding your doctor will assess the FVIII:C levels within 3 hours before 
surgery. If your FVIII level is inadequate your doctor may give you a dose of 40-60 IU/kg 
VEYVONDI 12-24 hours (pre-operative dose) prior to initiating elective surgery in order to raise 
FVIII levels to the target level (0.4 IU/mL for minor and at least 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery). Within 
1 hour prior to surgery, you will receive a dose of VEYVONDI based on the assessment 3 hours 
before surgery. The dose depends on VWF and FVIII levels of the patient, the type and severity of the 
expected bleeding. 
Prophylaxis treatment 
The usual starting dose for long term prophylaxis against bleeding episodes is 40 to 60 IU/kg twice 
weekly. The dose can be adjusted to a maximum of 80 IU/kg one to three times per week, depending 
on your condition and how well VEYVONDI is working for you. Your doctor will calculate the dose 
that is most appropriate for you, how often you should receive VEYVONDI and for how long. 
How VEYVONDI is given 
VEYVONDI is usually infused into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. Detailed 
instructions for reconstitution and admnistration are given at the end of this package leaflet. 
Use in children and adolescents 
VEYVONDI is not approved for use in children and adolescents below 18 years.  
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you use more VEYVONDI than you should 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. If you infuse more VEYVONDI than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible. There 
may be a risk of developing blood clots (thrombosis) in case of an accidental high dose. 
If you forget to use VEYVONDI 
- 
- 
Do not infuse a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  
Proceed with the next infusion as scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using VEYVONDI 
Do not stop using VEYVONDI without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Instructions for preparation and administration 
General instructions 
Check the expiry date, and ensure that the VEYVONDI powder and water for injections (solvent) are 
at room temperature prior to preparation. Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and 
carton. 
Use antiseptic technique (clean and low-germ conditions) and a flat work surface during the 
reconstitution procedure. Wash your hands and put on clean exam gloves (the use of gloves is 
optional). 
Use the reconstituted product (after mixing the powder with the supplied water) as soon as possible 
and within three hours. You can store the reconstituted product at room temperature not to exceed 
25 °C for up to three hours. Reconstituted product should not be refrigerated. Discard after 
three hours. 
Ensure that the VEYVONDI powder vial and the Sterilised Water for Injections (solvent) are at room 
temperature prior to preparation.  
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use plastic syringes with this product because proteins in the product tend to stick to the surface of 
glass syringes.  
Do not mix VEYVONDI with other medicinal products except for octocog alfa (ADVATE). 
Instructions for reconstitution 
1  Remove the caps from the VEYVONDI powder and solvent 
vials to expose the centre of the rubber stoppers. 
Steps 
Image example 
NA 
2  Disinfect each stopper with a separate sterile alcohol swab (or 
other suitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or 
haemophilia treatment centre) by wiping the stopper for 
several seconds. Allow the rubber stoppers to dry. Place the 
vials on a flat surface. 
3  Open the Mix2Vial device package by completely peeling 
away the lid, without touching the inside of the package. Do 
not remove the Mix2Vial device from the package. 
4  Turn the package with the Mix2Vial device upside down and 
place it over the top of the solvent vial. Firmly insert the blue 
plastic spike of the device into the centre of the solvent vial 
stopper by pushing straight down. Grip the package at its edge 
and lift it off the Mix2Vial device. Be careful not to touch the 
clear plastic spike. The solvent vial now has the Mix2Vial 
device connected to it and is ready to be connected to the 
VEYVONDI vial. 
5  To connect the solvent vial to the VEYVONDI vial, turn the 
solvent vial over and place it on top of the vial containing 
VEYVONDI concentrate. Fully insert the clear plastic spike 
into the VEYVONDI vial stopper by firmly pushing straight 
down. This should be done right away to keep the liquid free 
of germs. The solvent will flow into the VEYVONDI vial by 
vacuum. Check that all the solvent has transferred. Do not use 
if vacuum has been lost and the solvent does not flow into the 
VEYVONDI vial. 
6  Gently and continuously swirl the connected vials or allow the 
reconstituted product to stand for 5 minutes then gently swirl 
to ensure the powder is completely dissolved. Do not shake. 
Shaking will adversely affect the product. Do not refrigerate 
after reconstitution. 
7  Disconnect the two sides of the Mix2Vial from each other by 
holding the clear plastic side of the Mix2Vial device attached 
to the VEYVONDI vial with one hand and the blue plastic 
side of the Mix2Vial device attached to the solvent vial with 
the other hand. Turn the blue plastic side counterclockwise 
and gently pull the two vials apart. Do not touch the end of the 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps 
plastic connector attached to the VEYVONDI vial containing 
the dissolved product. Place the VEYVONDI vial on a flat 
work surface. Discard the empty solvent vial. 
8  Draw air into the empty, sterile disposable plastic syringe by 
pulling back on the plunger. The amount of air should equal 
the amount of reconstituted VEYVONDI that you will 
withdraw from the vial. 
Image example 
9  Leaving the VEYVONDI vial (containing the dissolved 
product) on your flat work surface, connect the syringe to the 
clear plastic connector by attaching and turning the syringe 
clockwise. 
10  Hold the vial with one hand and use the other hand to push all 
the air from the syringe into the vial 
11  Flip connected syringe and VEYVONDI vial so the vial is on 
top. Be sure to keep the syringe plunger pressed in. Draw the 
VEYVONDI into the syringe by pulling plunger back slowly. 
12  Do not push and pull solution back and forth between syringe 
and vial. Doing so may harm the medicine. When ready to 
infuse, disconnect the syringe by turning it counterclockwise. 
Inspect the syringe visually for particulate matter; the solution 
in the syringe should be clear. If flakes or particles are seen, 
do not use the solution and notify your doctor. 
13 
If you need more than one vial of VEYVONDI to make up 
your dose: 
  Leave the syringe attached to the vial until an 
additional vial is prepared.  
  Use the reconstitution steps above (2 to 8) to prepare 
the additional vial of VEYVONDI using a fresh 
Mix2Vial for each vial 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps 
Image example 
14  The contents of two vials may be drawn into a single syringe.  
NOTE: When pushing air into a second vial of VEYVONDI 
to be pooled into a syringe, position the vial and connected 
syringe so that the vial is on top. 
Instructions for administration 
Inspect the prepared solution in the syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration (the solution should be clear, colourless and free from particles). It is not uncommon 
for a few flakes or particles to remain in the product vial after reconstitution. The filter included in 
the Mix2Vial device removes those particles completely. Filtration does not influence dose 
calculations. The solution in the syringe should not be used if it is cloudy or contains flakes or 
particles after filtration.

4. 
Attach the infusion needle to a syringe containing VEYVONDI solution. For comfort, a winged 
(butterfly) infusion set is preferred. Point the needle up and remove any air bubbles by gently 
tapping the syringe with your finger and slowly and carefully pushing air out of the syringe and 
needle. 
Apply a tourniquet and get the infusion site ready by wiping the skin well with a sterile alcohol 
swab (or other suitable sterile solution suggested by your doctor or haemophilia treatment 
centre). 
Insert the needle into the vein and remove the tourniquet. Slowly infuse VEYVONDI. Do not 
infuse any faster than 4 mL per minute. Disconnect the empty syringe. If your dose requires 
multiple syringes, attach and administer each additional syringe of VEYVONDI one at a time. 
Note:  
Do not remove butterfly needle until all syringes have been infused and do not touch the Luer 
port that connects to the syringe. 
If recombinant factor VIII has been prescribed, administer recombinant factor VIII within 
10 minutes after infusion of VEYVONDI has been completed. 
Take the needle out of the vein and use sterile gauze to put pressure on the infusion site for 
several minutes. 
In case large volumes of VEYVONDI are required, it is possible to pool two vials of VEYVONDI 
together. The contents of each reconstituted product of VEYVONDI can be drawn in a single syringe. 
However, in these cases the initially reconstituted solution should not be diluted any further.  
Do not recap the needle. Place the needle, syringe, and empty VEYVONDI and solvent vial(s) in a 
hard-walled sharps container for proper disposal. Do not dispose of these supplies in ordinary 
household trash.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Treatment of bleeding episodes (On-demand treatment) 
Dose and frequency must be individualized based on clinical judgment, taking into account of severity 
of bleeding episode, site of bleeding, patient’s medical history, monitoring of appropriate clinical and 
laboratory measures (both VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels). 
Start of treatment 
VEYVONDI should be administered with recombinant factor VIII if the FVIII:C levels are < 40%, or 
are unknown, to control bleeding. The rFVIII dose should be calculated according to the difference 
between the patient’s baseline plasma FVIII:C level, and the desired peak FVIII:C level to achieve an 
appropriate plasma FVIII:C level based on the approximate mean recovery of 0.02 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). 
The complete dose of VEYVONDI should be administered followed by rFVIII within 10 minutes. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Calculating dose 
VEYVONDI dose [IU] = dose [IU/kg] x body weight [kg] 
Subsequent infusions 
Administer a subsequent dose of 40 IU to 60 IU/kg of VEYVONDI infused every 8 to 24 hours as per 
the dosing ranges in Table 1, as long as clinically required. In major bleeding episodes, maintain 
trough levels of VWF:RCo greater than 50% for as long as deemed necessary.

aIf rFVIII is administered, see rFVIII package insert for reconstitution and administration instructions. 
bA bleed could be considered major if red blood cell transfusion is either required or potentially indicated or if 
bleeding occurs in a critical anatomical site (e.g., intracranial or gastrointestinal haemorrhage). 
Prevention of bleeding/haemorrhage and treatment in case of elective surgery 
Assess FVIII:C levels prior to initiation of any surgical procedure. The recommended minimum target 
levels are 0.4 IU/mL for minor and oral surgery and 0.8 IU/mL for major surgery. 
To ensure pre-operative endogenous FVIII levels of at least 0.4 IU/mL for minor and oral and 
0.8 IU/mL for major surgery, a dose of 40-60 IU/kg VEYVONDI may be administered 12-24 hours 
(pre-operative dose) prior to initiating elective surgery. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, patients should 
receive a dose of VEYVONDI based on the assessment 3 hours before surgery. The dose depends on 
VWF and FVIII levels of the patient, the type and severity of the bleeding. 
If the FVIII:C levels are not at the recommended target, a dose of VEYVONDI alone should be 
administered within 1 hour prior to the procedure. If the FVIII:C levels are not at the recommended 
target levels, rFVIII should be administered in addition to vonicog alfa to raise VWF:RCo and 
FVIII:C. Please refer to Table 2 for FVIII:C recommended target levels.

During and after surgery 
After the initiation of the surgical procedure, the VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels should be 
monitored and the intra- and post-operative substitution regimen should be individualized according to 
the PK results, intensity and duration of the haemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of 
care. In general, the frequency of VEYVONDI dosing for post-operative substitution should range 
from twice a day to every 48 hours. Refer to Table 3 for treatment recommendations for subsequent 
maintenance doses.

For initiation of long-term prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with VWD, doses of 40 to 60 IU/kg 
of VEYVONDI administered twice weekly should be considered. Depending on the patient’s 
condition and clinical response, including breakthrough bleeds, higher doses (not exceeding 80 IU/kg) 
and/or an increased dose frequency (up to three times per week) may be required. 
Name and batch number of the medicinal product 
It is strongly recommended that every time that VEYVONDI is administered to a patient, the name 
and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the 
batch of the product.

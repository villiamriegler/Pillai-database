are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the following dosage recommendation in case of renal 
impairment has been updated in section 4.2 and 4.4. 
Forxiga, Edistride: dapagliflozin should not be initiated in 
patients with a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 
mL/min and should be discontinued at GFR persistently 
below 45 mL/min. No dosage adjustment is required based 
on renal function. 
Xigduo, Ebymect: the maximum daily dose of metformin 
should preferably be divided into 2-3 daily doses. Factors 
that may increase the risk of lactic acidosis should be 
reviewed before considering initiation of metformin in 
patients with GFR < 60 mL/min.

and prolonged release exenatide (a GLP 1 receptor agonist) 
was compared to dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release 
exenatide alone in subjects with inadequate glycaemic 
control on metformin alone (HbA1c ≥ 8% and ≤ 12%). All 
treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to 
baseline. The combination treatment with dapagliflozin 10 
mg and prolonged release exenatide group showed superior 
reductions in HbA1c from baseline compared to 
dapagliflozin alone and prolonged release exenatide alone. 
Combination therapy of dapagliflozin 10 mg and prolonged 
release exenatide resulted in significantly greater 
reductions in fasting plasma glucose, in 2 hour post 
prandial glucose, in body weight and systolic blood 
pressure at week 28, as compared to either agent alone.

Please refer to the assessment report:

726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
15 April 2016 the PRAC to assess the impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of canagliflozin containing 
medicinal products of an increase in amputations, 
mostly affecting the toes, observed in an ongoing 
clinical trial (CANVAS) for canagliflozin and a 
numerical imbalance with regards to amputation 
events seen in an ongoing renal study CANVAS-R 
with a similar population as CANVAS. 
Considering that a class effect cannot be excluded, 
the European Commission extended on 6 July 2016 
the scope of the procedure to include all SGLT2 
inhibitors containing medicinal products to allow a 
review of data from the class.  
The PRAC was requested to assess the impact 
thereof on the benefit-risk balance of Invokana, 
Vokanamet, Forxiga, Edistride, Xigduo, Ebymect, 
Jardiance and Synjardy and to give its 
recommendation whether the marketing 
authorisation of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion has been be adopted on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee.

added in section 4.5 of the Summary Product 
Characteristics as follows: 
Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay 
Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not 
recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in 
assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 
inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycaemic 
control.

726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
25 January 2016 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency on the adequacy of the current 
recommendations for metformin containing products 
with respect to the use in patients with moderate 
renal failure, taking into account the available 
information on the risk of lactic acidosis. The CHMP 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of metformin containing 
products and to give its recommendation whether 
the marketing authorisation of this product should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The notification for the procedure is appended to this 
opinion.

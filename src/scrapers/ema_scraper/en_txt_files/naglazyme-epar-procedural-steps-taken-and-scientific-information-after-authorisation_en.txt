SmPC,  Annex 
The wording of the therapeutic indication in section 4.1 of 
information on limited safety data in children under 5 
II  and PL 
the SmPC  was amended to remove the following 
years of age, based on the results from the final 
study report from the Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) 
VI  Clinical Surveillance Program (CSP)  listed as a 
Specific Obligation (SOB 002) in the Annex II  of the 
statements regarding safety in children aged below 5 
years: A key issue is to treat children aged <5 years 
suffering from a severe form of the disease, even though 
children <5 years were not included in the pivotal phase 3 
1 Notifications are issued for type I  variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II  variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II,  labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Product Information. This observational CSP was 
undertaken to characterise the natural progression of 
MPS VI,  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy 
data from Naglazyme treatment, to collect 
information on the effect of Naglazyme treatment on 
lactation, growth and development of infants of 
Naglazyme treated mothers, and to evaluate the 
effects of Naglazyme treatment on children under 5 
years of age. Further, section 5.1 of the SmPC  was 
updated to remove reference to marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances and 
Annex II  was updated in order to remove SOB 002. 
In addition, the statement on additional monitoring 
and corresponding black triangle were removed from 
the SmPC  and the Package leaflet, and the Annex II 
was aligned with the latest QRD template version 
10.2. The revised RMP version 7 was submitted in 
order to remove gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 
hepatic impairment and thrombocytopenia from the 
list of important potential risks, spinal cord 
compression and neutralising antibodies as important 
potential risks and pregnant or lactating women as 
missing information. As a consequence of the RMP 
updates, specific adverse reaction follow-up 
questionnaires for spinal cord compression were 
removed in Annex 4 of the RMP. 
C.I.11.b  - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
study. Limited data are available in patients < 1 year of 
age (see section 5.1) 
The final wording of the indication: 
Naglazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement 
therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of 
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS  VI;  N-acetylgalactosamine 
4-sulfatase deficiency; Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) (see 
section 5.1).

The MAH has conducted two through reviews; one using 
reflect the conclusions of a cumulative review of all 
post-marketing adverse events. This review was 
requested by the CHMP,  following review of PSUR-7. 
The MAH also took this opportunity to update the 
MedDRA terms used to describe adverse events 
collected during clinical studies involving Naglazyme. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly 
and Annex II  has been updated with a minor 
linguistic correction. 
C.I.3.b  - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR,  class labelling, a 
PSUR,  RMP,  FUM/SO,  data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC  - 
clinical trial data from 5 studies and the second using post-
marketing spontaneous data. Following these reviews a 
number of updates have been proposed to the Naglazyme 
product information.  
The re-analysis of the 5 clinical trials (ASB-00-001,  ASB-
04-01, ASB-03-05,  ASB-03-06  and ASB-008)  identified a 
total 59 patients who had received at least one dose of 
Naglazyme.  No treatment related deaths were identified 
from these clinical studies. Following the re-analysis of data 
set from study ASB-03-05,  the MAH has proposed the 
deletion of face oedema and the addition of arthralgia, 
rash, and hearing impaired to Table 1 in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.   The MAH proposal to remove Apnoea from Table 1 
Page 11/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
to the post-marketing section was not endorsed as this 
ADR was only identified in a clinical study setting.   
The cumulative review of post-marketing spontaneous 
reports revealed a number of ADRs that were reported 
more frequently in Naglazyme-treated subjects.  Most of 
these were hypersensitivity type reactions that occurred 
during Naglazyme infusion. The MAH proposed to 
strengthen the wording relating to hypersensitivity 
reactions and management in section 4.4. of the 
Naglazyme SmPC.  Five cases of CCF  were identified 
however, 3 patients had worsening of pre-existing CCF,  and 
it is not known whether such patients were included in 
clinical trials. The MAH will continue to monitor cases of 
CCF  as part of routine Pharmacovigilance, and will update 
the Risk Management Plan should this term become a more 
clearly identified risk. 
According to the data presented, the hypersensitivity 
reactions in association with Naglazyme therapy were of 
different degrees of severity ranging from very severe, life-
threatening to mild symptoms. Whilst the CHMP 
acknowledge that other treatment options for MPS VI 
patients are limited, rechallenge in patients who have 
experienced a severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to 
Naglazyme is not considered to be acceptable. Therefore, 
the CHMP was of the view that Naglazyme should be 
contraindicated in cases of severe or life-threatening 
hypersensitivity, if hypersensitivity is not controllable.

The infant study (ASB-008)  is a Phase IV,  multi-center, 
Package Leaflet to reflect the results of study ASB-
II  and PL 
multi-national, open-label, randomized, two-dose level 
008 (infant study), as requested by the CHMP 
following evaluation of this study report as part of

MAH took the opportunity to update Annex II  to 
reflect the completion of a commitment as per the 
4th Annual Reassessment. 
C.I.z  - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two 
dose levels (1 mg/kg/week and 2 mg/kg/week)  of 
Naglazyme in preventing the progression of skeletal 
dysplasia in infants under the age of one who have MPS VI. 
The study started in May 2006 and was completed in April 
2009. 
Four patients completed the study. 
Although limited by the very small number of patients that 
could be enrolled and their short follow-up, the conclusions 
that can be drawn from this study are the following: 
Page 13/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
" 
Treatment with Naglazyme did not prevent the 
progression of skeletal dysplasia and development of 
hernias in infants less than 2 years of age and, as 
expected, did not prevent the progression of corneal 
clouding. 
" 
However, it prevented development or worsening 
of facial dysmorphism and improved hearing loss to some 
extent. 
" 
High urinary GAG levels decreased by more than 
70%, as was observed with older patients. 
" 
Growth remained essentially normal over this 
limited follow-up period. 
" 
Some level of improvement in hearing was 
observed in all subjects. 
" 
The dose of 2 mg/kg/week  was not more effective 
than the current recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/week.   Of 
note, the randomisation allocated the higher dose to the 
oldest children (aged > 1 year). 
The overall safety profile of the higher dose of 2 
mg/kg/week  did not seem different in a clinically 
meaningful manner from that of the 1 mg/kg/week dose.  
They were consistent with the safety profile of Naglazyme 
in previous clinical trials involving older children.  No new 
safety signal emerged in this small group of infants.

Annex II 
"The CHMP,  having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations submitted by the MAH and 
having re-assessed the benefit/risk profile of the medicinal 
product, concluded that the benefit/risk balance for the 
product remains favourable.  
The CHMP agreed that the Marketing Authorisation for 
Naglazyme should remain under exceptional circumstances 
and agreed on a revised list of Specific Obligations. The 
following Specific Obligation has been fulfilled with the 
annual re-assessment: 
SOB-4:  "All clinical trial patients are currently receiving the 
product manufactured by the commercial process. GAG and 
antibody samples continue to be collected at protocol-
specified intervals. A change in nature or frequency of the 
adverse events and serious adverse events that are 
collected in an ongoing fashion within these studies will be 
evaluated to investigate a potential relationship between an

observed change in safety parameters and the transition to 
commercial material and reported in the annual CSP 
reports and PSURs as appropriate.  
The MAH commits to analysing the data from patients who 
have received clinical and then commercial process product 
to determine if there was any change to safety (antibody 
formation) or efficacy parameters stemming from the 
transition to commercial material and will provide this 
analysis in the clinical study reports for each of these 
studies when complete. The Clinical Study Reports for all 
studies are targeted for submission no later than January 
2007".

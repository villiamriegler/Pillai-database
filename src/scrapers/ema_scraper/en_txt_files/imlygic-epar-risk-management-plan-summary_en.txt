PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Imlygic (Talimogene Laherparepvec) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Imlygic.  The RMP details 
important risks of Imlygic, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Imlygic's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Imlygic's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Imlygic should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Imlygic should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Imlygic's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Imlygic is authorized for treatment of adults with unresectable (cannot be removed by 
surgery) melanoma (a kind of skin cancer) that is regionally (in the skin or lymph nodes 
near the original skin tumor) or distantly metastatic (spread to distant areas of skin or 
lymph nodes) (Stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral 
(internal organ) disease.  It contains talimogene laherparepvec as the active substance 
and it is given by intralesional injection (injection into the tumor). 
Further information about the evaluation of Imlygic’s benefits can be found in Imlygic’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/Imlygic. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks  
Important risks of Imlygic, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Imlygic's risks, are outlined below. 
 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Imlygic, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Imlygic is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Imlygic are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Imlygic.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

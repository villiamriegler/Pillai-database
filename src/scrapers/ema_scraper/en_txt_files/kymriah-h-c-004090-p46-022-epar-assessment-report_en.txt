2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study CCTL019C2202 is a stand-alone study.  
Primary results with cut-off date 10-Oct-2021 of the CCTL019C2202-study were submitted as a part of 
the Type II variation EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0056. The primary results of the study fulfilled the 
paediatric investigational plan (PIP) EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01, which do not support a paediatric 
indication. 
The second of two opened PIPs for Kymriah, is EMEA-001654-PIP01-14-M03 with clinical measure still 
ongoing and completion date by Nov-2026.   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
According to SmPC, the approved dose range for paediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL is 
0.2 to 5 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body weight for patients ≤ 50 kg and 0.1 to 2.5 × 108 
CAR-positive viable T cells (non-weight based) for patients > 50 kg. The approved dose range (non-
weight based) for adult patients with DLBCL and FL is 0.6 to 6 × 108 CAR-positive viable T cells.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Kymriah (INN: tisagenlecleucel, product code CTL019) was approved in the Europe Union (EU) via the 
centralised procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090 on 22-Aug-2018 and is indicated for the treatment of: 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse.

Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy. 
Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic 
therapy. 
Tisagenlecleucel is a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based gene therapy product 
that contains autologous genetically modified T-cells. The product is manufactured from the patient’s 
own peripheral blood T-cells, which are transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector that encodes a CAR 
directed against human CD19 on the surface of B-cells. The CAR is comprised of a murine single chain 
antibody fragment that recognises CD19 and is fused to intracellular signalling domains from the 
costimulatory receptor 4-1BB (CD137) and the T-cell receptor associated CD3 zeta complex. The CD3 
zeta component is critical for initiating T-cell activation and anti-tumour activity, while 4-1BB enhances 
the activation, expansion, and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. Upon binding to CD19 expressing cells, 
the CAR transmits a signal promoting T-cell activation, expansion, and acquisition of effector functions 
of tisagenlecleucel, such as cytotoxicity and elimination of CD19 expressing target cells. This allows the 
genetically modified T-cells to specifically target and destroy CD19-positive malignant B-cells in an 
antigen dependent, but major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent manner. 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
CCTL019C2202; BIANCA 
The CCTL019C2202 (C2202) study is a phase II, single arm, multicenter open label trial to determine 
the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mature 
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], 
primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma [PMBCL] and gray zone lymphoma [GZL]).  
The primary analysis of the C2202-study was assessed in the type II variation, category C.I.4 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0056 with CAT opinion in 09-Sep-2022. The aim was to update the 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary analysis results from study C2202. The MAH 
considered that the submitted study results did not support a paediatric indication. The PDCO issued a 
positive outcome for the final compliance check of EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01 on 24-June-2022. 
Since the analysis of the C2202-study is finalised, the MAH has submitted the completed paediatric 
study for tisagenlecleucel, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
No changes to the current tisagenlecleucel core data sheet and/or the approved Kymriah SmPC are 
proposed.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study C2202 
Description 
Study C2202 is a phase II, single arm, multi-centre open-label trial to determine the safety and 
efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with r/r mature B-cell NHL.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Subjects recruited to Study C2202 were representative of the broader clinical population of paediatric 
and young adult patients with CD19+ mature B-cell NHL, who had relapsed after 1 or more prior 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

therapies or were primary refractory, defined as not achieved a CR or PR after first line of therapy. 
Subjects that achieved a CR prior to CTL019-infusion were excluded from the efficacy analysis set.  
For inclusion/exclusion criteria and prior therapies, see documentation for procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0056. 
No additional subjects were enrolled or treated since the primary analysis of 2021. 
Treatments 
The approved dose range for paediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL is 0.2 to 5 × 106 CAR-
positive viable T cells/kg body weight for patients ≤ 50 kg and 0.1 to 2.5 × 108 CAR-positive viable T 
cells (non-weight based) for patients > 50 kg. The approved dose range (non-weight based) for adult 
patients with DLBCL and FL is 0.6 to 6 × 108 CAR-positive viable T cells.   
For given doses, bridging therapies and lymphodepleting therapies, see documentation for procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0056. 
Primary objective 
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as measured by ORR and 
determined by local investigator assessments in subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is ORR, which includes CR and PR as determined by local investigator 
assessments.  
Secondary endpoint included among others:  
•  DOR - defined as the time from the date of first documented disease response (CR or PR) as 
determined by local investigator assessments to the date of first documented progression or 
death due to underlying cancer  
• 
• 
EFS - defined as the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the earliest date of 
death from any cause, disease progression as determined by local investigator assessments, or 
starting new anticancer therapy for underlying cancer, excluding HSCT 
PFS - defined as the time from the date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of first 
documented disease progression as determined by local investigator assessments or death due 
to any cause 
•  OS - defined as the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of death due to 
any cause 
• 
Evaluate the safety of tisagenlecleucel therapy with physical examination, vital signs, adverse 
events, laboratory abnormalities, performance status and as applicable physical development 
•  Characterize the presence of pre-existing and treatment induced immunogenicity and impact 
on cellular kinetics and response 
Sample size, randomisation and blinding  
The single arm, open-label study design and the sample size of the trial were justified, according to the 
MAH by the rarity of r/r B-cell NHL subject population, poor prognosis, lack of approved effective

standard therapies in this setting and limited recruitment to selected and specially trained 
tisagenlecleucel infusion centres. 
Results 
Primary analysis - data cutoff date 10-Oct-2021 
A short description of the primary analysis is given here. For further details, the primary analysis of the 
C2202-study was assessed in the type II variation, category C.I.4 procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0056 with CAT opinion in 09-Sep-2022.  
The primary analysis covered 33 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel. The data cutoff date (DCO) for 
the analysis was 10-Oct-2021, and the median time between tisagenlecleucel infusion and DCO was 
16.1 months. The efficacy analysis set (EAS) consisted of 24 patients <18 years of age, and four 
patients ≥18 and <25 years of age.  
Of the 33 subjects, 55% had Burkitt lymphoma and 46% had LBCL (30% had DLBCL, 9% had PMBCL, 
and 3% each had GZL and high-grade B-cell lymphoma). No subject with FL was enrolled. 
Subjects were classified as relapsed or progression (55%), refractory (30%), or primary refractory 
(15%). The patients enrolled had relatively advanced disease, with 88% at stage III/IV at baseline, a 
median of 2 lines of prior therapy, 18% with prior haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  
At the time of the DCO, the primary endpoint, ORR, was 32% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 52.4), 
with 7% achieving complete response (CR) and 25% achieving partial response (PR) as best overall 
response (BOR). Subgroup analysis suggested a trend towards lower ORR in subjects with Burkitt 
lymphoma (20%) versus other histologies (46%). ORR in the DLBCL subgroup was 38%, and the two 
patients achieving CR in the EAS had DLBCL.  
At DCO, median DOR in subjects who achieved a BOR of CR/PR was not reached due to short follow up 
(2.4 months). Of 9 responders, 3 subjects had an event prior to DCO, 3 subjects were censored due to 
new antineoplastic therapy or HSCT, and 3 subjects were censored due to ongoing without event. As of 
the DCO date, median PFS was 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9) while median OS was 11.4 months 
(95% CI: 3.4, NE). Fourteen subjects, including three subjects with a BOR of PR in the EAS, had died 
at the time of the DCO. 
Final analysis – data cutoff date 26-Apr-2023 
No additional subjects were enrolled or treated since the primary analysis data cut-off. At the time of 
the final analysis, there was 1 additional death since the primary analysis. 
Efficacy results 
As seen in table 1, the ORR per local investigator assessment was 32% and complete response was 
observed in 3 subjects (11%), an increase from 2 subjects (7%) at the primary analysis. Median 
event-free survival was 2.1 months, median progression-free survival 2.5 months, and median overall 
survival was 10.4 months. The latter was 11.4 months in the primary analysis. 
Median duration of response and relapse-free survival data were not estimable as of study completion, 
in accordance with the primary analysis. Of the 9 subjects (included in the EAS) with a BOR of CR/PR, 
3 subjects reported relapse or died due to underlying disease prior to study completion, 3 subjects 
were censored due to new anticancer therapy (± HSCT), and 3 subjects had ongoing response at the 
end of study.

In BL, the ORR was 20% (3/15 subjects) (95% CI: 4.3, 48.1), with 0 subjects achieving CR as BOR 
and 3 subjects (20.0%) achieving PR as BOR. In subjects with LBCL, the ORR was 46% (6/13 subjects) 
(95% CI: 19.2, 74.9), with 3 subjects (23%) each achieving CR or PR as BOR. 
There was a trend for higher ORR with higher age as young adults who were ≥ 18 years of age had a 
higher ORR (2 of 4 subjects, 50%) compared to subjects < 18 years of age (7 of 24 subjects, 29%). 
The median observation time increased from 16.1 months at the primary analysis to 34.6 months at 
the final analysis. One subject changed from PR to CR as BOR, with an unchanged ORR of 32%. A 
trend for higher ORR was observed in subjects with histologies other than BL and in young adult 
subjects.

Overall survival  
At the time of primary analysis, median OS was 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, NE). There were 14 events 
(subject deaths), and 14 subjects were censored with a maximum follow-up of 28.1 months. The 
sensitivity analysis censoring for HSCT resulted in a median OS of 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, NE). At 
the time of the final analysis, there was 1 additional death since the primary analysis. Overall median 
OS was 10.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, NE) and the probability of survival at 24 months was 46% (95% 
CI: 27.6, 63.3). The updated sensitivity analysis censoring for HSCT resulted in a median OS of 6.1 
months (95% CI: 1.9, NE).

Assessor’s comment: 
In sum, the increase in median observation time from the primary analysis (16.1 months) to final 
analysis (34.6 months), did not change the overall picture from the primary analysis: The ORR is 
unchanged 32.1%. One more subject reached CR as BOR, so the proportion of CR increased from 
7.1% to 10.7%. One additional death since the primary analysis resulted in a reduction of median OS 
from 11.4 to 10.4 months.  
Safety results 
According to the MAH, the overall safety profile in paediatric and young adult subjects with CD19+ r/r 
mature B-cell NHL infused with tisagenlecleucel was consistent with the known safety of 
tisagenlecleucel. No new safety signals were observed. 
Adverse events prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion 
Among subjects who received lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, 72% 
experienced at least 1 AE and 47% had grade ≥ 3 AEs. AEs suspected to be related to lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy were reported in 47% of subjects, with 31% of subjects having ≥ grade 3 AEs.  
Adverse events post-tisagenlecleucel infusion 
All subjects who were infused with tisagenlecleucel experienced at least 1 AE and at least 1 grade ≥3 
AE post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most commonly reported grade ≥ 3 AEs were neutrophil count 
decreased (30%), anemia and white blood cell count decreased (24% each), and neutropenia and 
platelet count decreased (21% each).

Adverse events at any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion 
AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel were reported in 85% of subjects, with 73% of subjects 
having grade ≥ 3 events, at any time after the first tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most commonly 
reported AE suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel was cytokine release syndrome, CRS (70%) 
and the grade ≥3 was neutrophil count decreased (21%) 
Serious adverse events 
Regardless of relationship to tisagenlecleucel, 73% of subjects infused with tisagenlecleucel 
experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. The most commonly reported SAEs (> 10% in all 
subjects) were CRS (24%) and pyrexia (21%). Of these, 1 subject had a grade ≥3 SAE of CRS and 2 
subjects had a grade ≥3 SAE of pyrexia. The most frequently reported PTs in the final analysis were 
similar to those reported in the primary analysis.

Deaths 
At the time of primary analysis, 16 subjects (49%) died after tisagenlecleucel infusion, with the 
majority of subjects dying due to study indication (14 subjects; 42%) and occurred > 30 days post 
tisagenlecleucel infusion (15 subjects; 46%). At the time of final analysis, a total of 17 subjects 
(51.5%) died after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The majority of subjects died due to study indication (15 
subjects; 46%) and 1 death occurring within 30 days of the tisagenlecleucel infusion. Two subjects 
(6%) died due to other causes (1 due to pseudomonas infection and 1 due to respiratory failure). Both 
events were considered not related to the study treatment by the Investigator. 
Adverse events of special interest based on important identified risks 
Regardless of relationship to tisagenlecleucel, AESIs based on important identified risks of 
tisagenlecleucel were experienced by 97% of subjects, with 82% having a grade ≥ 3 event. The overall 
(grade ≥ 3) incidence of specific important identified risks any time post tisagenlecleucel infusion were:  
•  CRS, 70% (15%) 
•  Hematological disorders including cytopenias, 79% (76%) 
• 
Infections, 36% (18%) 
•  Serious neurological adverse reactions, 30% (15%)

• 
• 
Prolonged depletion of normal B-cells or agammaglobulinemia, 18% (3%) 
Tumor lysis syndrome, 0% (0%) 
Cytokine release syndrome 
Cytokine release syndrome events, which were expected with tisagenlecleucel treatment, were 
reported in 70% of subjects, with 15% of subjects experiencing grade ≥ 3 events. When analysed by 
disease response, CRS was less prominent when subjects had a complete or partial response. 
According to the MAH, this is likely due to the fact that subjects with a histology of BL had a higher 
incidence of CRS (16 of 18 subjects, 89%) than those with a histology of LBCL (7 of 15 subjects, 47%) 
and the proportion of subjects with CR or PR was lower in subjects with a histology of BL (3 of 15 
subjects, 20%) than those with a histology of LBCL (6 of 13 subjects, 46%). 
Neurological events (Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) 
In total, 30% of subjects experienced serious neurological adverse reactions with 15% experiencing a 
grade ≥ 3 event. Of these, 64% of the neurological events resolved with an estimated probability of 
resolution of 46% (95% CI: 22.0, 77.1) on Day 7.  
Hematopoietic cytopenias and infections 
Hematopoietic cytopenias are a common occurrence after tisagenlecleucel infusion and tisagenlecleucel 
activity targeting normal B-cells. Prolonged hematocytopenias not resolved by day 28 are considered a 
consequence. The etiology of the cytopenias may be either the CAR-T-cell therapy per se or prior anti-
cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy (i.e., multiple lines and cycles), radiation, lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy or a combination, exerting cytotoxic effects. Prolonged neutropenia has been associated 
with increased risk of infection. Hematological disorders including cytopenias were reported in 79% of 
subjects, with majority experiencing grade ≥ 3 events. Majority of these hematological disorders were 
resolved by Month 6 with no subjects at risk at Month 9. Infections of any grade were reported in 36% 
of subjects, with 18% of subjects experiencing grade ≥3 events.  
Immunogenicity 
According to the MAH, pre-existing/humoral immunogenicity does not seem to have any impact on 
exposure. The preexisting antibodies, i.e., at enrolment, or maximum fold change from baseline to 
post infusion were not associated with any impact on clinical response. The scatter plot for net 
response (%) versus the exposure metrics suggested no apparent relationship between the cellular 
immunogenicity responses and in vivo expansion and persistence of tisagenlecleucel transgene or 
clinical response. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
As noted in the previous report of the primary analysis from 2021, the study’s single arm nature, the

neoplastic treatment after tisagenlecleucel infusion, entails that the results should be interpreted with 
caution.  
The final results following a longer observation time are overall in line with the results from the 
primary analysis. The conclusion from the primary analysis is still valid: The primary endpoint result in 
study C2202 may seem to be somewhat in line with, although numerically lower, than the ORR 
obtained in the adult DLBCL patients enrolled in the pivotal study C2201 with ORR 53% (95%CI: 43.5, 
62.4) and CRR 39%. In absence of an estimate for median DOR, the clinical relevance of the observed 
ORR can still not be assessed. 
Furthermore, these results are equally constrained by the study limitations as the primary analysis; A 
single arm study design, the limited number of subjects included, and the subsequent anti-neoplastic 
treatment. 
No SmPC updates have been raised by the MAH, based on the final analysis results. According to EMA 
SmPC guideline, the information in SmPC section 5.1 should be updated when ‘new relevant 
information becomes available’. Information regarding observation time, response rates and time-to-
event endpoints could be considered new and relevant. Especially an estimate for median DOR to 
support the observed ORR could be relevant. Unfortunately, a median DOR is still not estimable.  
In the study protocol, no pre-defined time point for the final analysis has been made. From a statistical 
point of view, the primary analysis is considered to be the inferential analysis and the results from the 
present and final analysis can be interpreted as supportive to the earlier results. 
Considering the interpretation limitations to the C2202 study as outlined and the supportive nature of 
the final analysis, no changes, or further additions to the SmPC are considered necessary.  
The benefit-risk evaluation remains unchanged and positive.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The final analysis results from the CCTL019C2202 study have been reported by the MAH, since the 
primary analysis in 2021. No SmPC updates have been raised by the MAH in this procedure.  
The final ORR of 32% is unchanged from the ORR from the primary analysis. The ORR is in line with, 
although numerically lower, than the ORR obtained in the adult DLBCL patients, 53%. Despite longer 
observation time, a median DOR is still not estimable, and it is therefore challenging to assess the 
clinical relevance of the observed ORR. Only small changes in BOR and OS are seen in the closing 
analysis.  
Considering the interpretation limitations to the C2202 study as outlined above and the non-inferential 
nature of the final analysis, no changes, or further additions to the SmPC are considered necessary.

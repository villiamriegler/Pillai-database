Mavenclad® 10 mg tablets 
Mavenclad 
Centralized 
Chemical class: Chlorinated purine nucleoside analogue A chlorine substitution 
in the purine ring protects cladribine from degradation by adenosine deaminase, 
increasing the intracellular residence time of the cladribine prodrug 
relatively 
(DCK)  and 
Summary  of  mode  of  action:  Cladribine  is  a  prodrug  that  has  to  be 
phosphorylated intracellularly to become biologically active. Phosphorylation of 
cladribine to its active triphosphate form, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine triphosphate 
(Cd-ATP),  is  particularly  efficiently  achieved  in  lymphocytes,  due  to  their 
low 
constitutively  high  deoxycytidine  kinase 
5'-nucleotidase  (5'-NTase)  levels.  A  high  DCK  to  5'-NTase  ratio  favors  the 
accumulation  of  Cd-ATP,  making  lymphocytes  particularly  susceptible  to  cell 
death. As a result of a lower DCK/5'-NTase ratio other bone marrow derived 
cells are less affected than lymphocytes. DCK is the rate limiting enzyme for 
conversion of the cladribine prodrug into its active triphosphate form, leading to 
selective depletion of dividing and non-dividing T and B cells. 
The primary apoptosis-inducing mechanism of action of Cd-ATP has direct and 
indirect actions on DNA synthesis and mitochondrial function. In dividing cells, 
Cd-ATP interferes with DNA synthesis via inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase 
and competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA by 
DNA polymerases. In resting cells cladribine causes DNA single-strand breaks, 
rapid nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consumption, ATP depletion and cell 
death.  There  is  evidence  that  cladribine  can  also  cause  direct  caspase-
dependent  and  -independent  apoptosis  via  the  release  of  cytochrome  c  and 
apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol of non-dividing cells. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology involves a complex chain of events in which 
different immune cell types, including autoreactive T and B cells play a key role. 
The mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is not 
fully elucidated but its predominant effect on B and T lymphocytes is thought to 
interrupt the cascade of immune events central to MS.

Module  SI  -  Epidemiology  of  the  Indication(s)  and  Target 
Population  
Mavenclad® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing multiple 
sclerosis (MS) as defined by clinical or imaging features. 
Incidence  
Multiple sclerosis is a complex demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and 
represents the most common cause of acquired neurological disability in young adults in developed 
countries (Compston and Coles 2008). 
Regionally, the median estimated incidence is greatest in Europe (3.8 per 100,000 person-years), 
followed  by  the  Americas  (2.5),  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  (2),  the  Western  Pacific  (0.9),  and 
Africa (0.1). No data are available from countries in South-East Asia.  
The epidemiology of multiple sclerosis in European and other non-European countries is presented 
in Table 1. European countries with highest incidence of MS are Bosnia and Herzegovina (12 per 
100,000 person-years), Latvia (11.6 per 100,000 person-years), Czech Republic (11 per 100,000 
person-years), Estonia, Hungary, and Iceland (each at 10 per 100,000 person-years).

Demographics  of  the  population  in  the  authorized  indication  –  age,  gender,  racial  and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease  
Typically, symptoms of MS begin in the third and fourth decade of life and extend over many 
years (Coyle 2014). Studies have shown a lower prevalence of MS in African American, Japanese 
and  Chinese  populations,  and  a  higher  prevalence 
in  European  and  American 
populations (Oreja-Guevara  2014).  In  addition,  a  female:male  ratio  of  approximately  2.5:1  has 
been demonstrated (Oreja-Guevara 2014).  
The  exact  cause  of  MS  is  unknown.  Risk  factors  for  MS  include  genetic  predisposition  and 
environmental  factors  and  a  complex  interaction  of  both  genetic  and  environmental  factors  is 
probably involved in the etiology of MS: 
•  Approximately  15%  of  patients  with  MS  have  a  positive  family  history.  Recurrence  among 
monozygotic twins is approximately 35%, reflecting the extent of genetic predisposition. The 
estimated risk to the siblings of a proband is 3–5%, increasing to 29.5% if one or both parents 
have MS. Risk to the offspring of a patient with MS is 2–3% and higher if both parents have 
MS (20%) (Oreja-Guevara 2014). 
•  Several genes are associated with susceptibility for MS, most importantly HLA-DRB1, IL7R 
(CD127), IL2R, and SOCS1 (Oreja-Guevara 2014). 
•  Environmental factors associated with the development of MS are vitamin D deficiency, low 
exposure to sunlight, cigarette smoking, and Epstein−Barr virus infection. However, no single 
environmental factor appears to be sufficient for the etiology of MS (Oreja-Guevara 2014). 
•  Other  viruses  are  also  implicated  in  the  etiology  of  MS,  although  this  has  not  been 
unequivocally confirmed (George 2012). 
The main existing treatment options 
Treatment options for relapsing MS include disease modifying therapies, medications used to treat 
relapses and symptomatic treatments. Disease modifying agents impact the underlying disease by 
targeting some aspect of the inflammatory process of MS, and reducing the frequency of relapses, 
decreasing the development of new CNS lesions as seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 
and slowing the accumulation of disability. These treatments include injectable medications (i.e. 
interferon  (IFN)  β-1a,  IFN  β-1b,  glatiramer  acetate);  oral  medications  (i.e.  teriflunomide, 
fingolimod,  ozanimod,  dimethyl  fumarate)  and  infusion  medications  (i.e.  alemtuzumab, 
ocrelizumab,  mitoxantrone,  and  natalizumab).  Treatment  options  for  acute  relapses  include 
corticosteroids. 
Generally, concomitant medications in  MS patients  aim at  alleviating symptoms  that affect  the 
ability of MS patients to carry out normal activities of daily life and/or minimizing risk factors for 
an acute exacerbation (Ziemsen 2011, Thompson 2010). These medications may be used to treat 
a  variety  of  different  impairments,  e.g.  fatigue,  spasticity,  bladder  dysfunction,  pain,  mood 
disorders,  depression,  ameliorate  involuntary  and  uncontrollable  episodes  of  laughing  and/or 
crying,  known  as  the  ‘pseudobulbar  affect’  (Damal  2013),  changes  in  cognitive  function  or 
memory, sexual dysfunction, tremor, urinary tract infections, and others.

Table 2 displays the most common concomitant medications used in the target population of MS 
patients to alleviate symptoms/complications of MS (source: National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence  (NICE)  guideline  186  on  the  management  of  multiple  sclerosis  in  primary  and 
secondary care, issued on October 2014, other NICE guidelines, literature, and information from 
the  National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society).  Other  medications  commonly  used  in  the  target 
population are those commonly prescribed in co-morbidities found in MS (see Table 3).

No  medicines  targeted  at  fatigue  should  be  used 
routinely.  
Other factors causing fatigue, such as disturbed sleep, 
chronic  pain  and  poor  nutrition,  should  be  identified 
and treated if possible. 
Any  person  who  wishes  to  control  urinary  frequency 
during the day (for example, when traveling), and who 
has  failed  with  other  measures,  should  be  offered 
desmopressin,  but  desmopressin  should  never  be 
used more than once in 24 hours. 
Any person with MS with more than three confirmed 
episodes of urinary tract infection in a period of 1 year 
should  be  assessed  by  a  continence  specialist  for 
residual urine and other evidence of risk factors, and 
offered appropriate treatment and guidance. 
Bowel problems

Male: Phosphodiesterase-5 
inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil, 
tadalafil, avanafil) 
Gabapentin, memantine  
In  the  North  American  Research  Committee  on 
Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) patient registry, half of 
the  patients  reporting  depression  received  treatment 
for  it,  namely:  fluoxetine  (21%),  sertraline  (19%) 
paroxetine  (12%),  amitriptyline  (11%),  venlafaxine 
(5%) (Lo 2005). In Denmark, 11% of the MS patients 
take antidepressants (Svendsen 2003). 
Refer the person with MS for specialist advice if there 
is no improvement of oscillopsia after treatment with 
gabapentin  and  memantine  or  side  effects  prevent 
continued use.  
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Multiple  sclerosis  is  an  inflammatory  disorder  of  the  brain  and  spinal  cord  in  which  focal 
lymphocytic  infiltration  leads  to  damage  of  myelin  and  axons  (Compston  2008).  The  initial 
symptoms  often  include  weakness  or  diminished  dexterity  in  one  or  more  limbs,  a  sensory 
disturbance, optic neuritis, diplopia, gait instability, and ataxia (Hunter 2016). As MS progresses, 
bladder dysfunction, fatigue,  and heat  sensitivity occur in  many patients. Additional symptoms 
include  Lhermitte’s  sign,  facial  weakness  or  pain,  vertigo,  brief  tonic  spasms,  and  other 
paroxysmal  symptoms,  which  are  believed  to  represent  discharges  along  demyelinated  axons. 
Cognitive deficits are common, particularly in advanced cases, and include memory loss, impaired 
attention, problem-solving difficulties, slowed information processing, and difficulties in shifting 
between cognitive tasks. The disease pathology is characterized by multifocal lesions within the 
CNS,  in  both  the  white  matter  and  gray  matter,  with  perivenular  inflammatory  cell  infiltrates, 
demyelination, axonal transection, neuronal degeneration, and gliosis (Hunter 2016). 
During the early course of the disease inflammation is transient and remyelination occurs, leading 
to  episodes  of  neurological  dysfunction  that  usually  recover  (Compston  2008).  However,  over 
time, widespread microglial activation is associated with extensive and chronic neurodegeneration 
leading  to  progressive  accumulation  of  disability.  Clinically,  MS  is  characterized  by  discrete 
episodes (attacks or relapses) of neurologic dysfunction (Gelfand 2014). Commonly, patients may 
experience numbness, tingling, weakness, vision loss, gait impairment, incoordination, imbalance, 
and  bladder  dysfunction.  In  between  these  attacks,  at  least  during  the  remitting  periods  of  the 
illness, patients have fairly stable neurologic function although patients experience fatigue or heat 
sensitivity in the interval between attacks. Over several years to decades, many patients who begin 
with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) evolve to the secondary progressive features of illness, in 
which  they  experience  an  insidious  worsening  of  function  and  accumulation  of  neurologic 
disability.

A review of frequency and symptom severity of domain-specific impairments conducted using the 
North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry data from over 
35,000 patients found that of the 11 domains commonly affected in MS (mobility, hand function, 
vision,  fatigue,  cognition,  bowel/bladder  function,  sensory,  spasticity,  pain,  depression,  and 
tremor/coordination),  the  severity  of  impairment  increases  with  disease  duration  across  all 
domains, but  the patterns of disability  accumulation differ (Kister 2013).  In the mobility, hand 
function,  bowel/bladder  function,  and  spasticity  domains,  worsening  impairment  was  observed 
over the three decades of disease, whereas for other domains such as vision, cognition, sensory, 
pain, and depression there was little change after 15 years of disease. 
Mortality  due  to  MS  is  difficult  to  determine  because  of  poor  data  collection  and  reporting. 
Nevertheless, the following reports illustrate that mortality is increased in patients with MS: 
Globally,  age-standardized  death  rates  have  decreased  significantly  (change  –11.5%,  95% 
UI – 35.4 to –4.7) between 1990 and 2016 (GBD 2016 Multiple Sclerosis Collaborators, 2019). A 
review of large MS cohort registries assessing mortality found that, compared with the general 
healthy  population, 
to 
14 years (Scalfari 2013). A more recent study using population-based administrative data of 5,797 
persons with MS and 28,807 controls matched according to sex, year of birth, and region, showed 
that the median survival from birth in the MS population was lower (75.9 years versus 83.4 years) 
compared to the matched controls (Marrie 2015h).  
in  patients  with  MS  was 
life  expectancy 
reduced  by  7 
Complications of MS account for 50-75% of the deaths among patients with MS (Scalfari 2013). 
The large variation of the proportion of “deaths due to MS” (50% to 75%) may be related to the 
fact that the definition of death due to MS can be variably interpreted by doctors or be entirely 
unknown for those not familiar with MS. Deaths not related to MS are mainly attributable to the 
common causes of death in the non-MS population: cardiovascular disease (range from 13.1% to 
26%), cancer (range from 9.5% to 35%), infectious and respiratory disease (range from 1.5% to 
5.4%), and accidents or suicide (range from 0% to 28%) (Scalfari 2013). 
A meta-analysis of 12 studies including data from over 28,000 patients with MS revealed that the 
pooled  all-cause  standardized  mortality  ratio  was  2.8  (95%  Confidence  Interval  (CI)  2.7-2.9). 
Compared with the general population, patients with MS had increased death rates from infection 
and respiratory diseases, suicide, and cardiovascular disease (Manouchehrinia 2016). 
In another study the mortality rate from MS (per 100,000 persons) in Europe ranged from 0.36 in 
Spain to 1.48 in Norway for the period 1990 to 1994 (Ekestern 2004). In the US, mortality rate 
was 1.44 deaths per 100,000 persons from 1990 to 2001 (Redelings 2006).  
Important co-morbidities 
A comprehensive review of the literature of co-morbidities in MS reveals that treating physicians 
need to be aware of specific co-morbid conditions in MS patients and need to ensure appropriate 
screening and treatment (Marrie 2015). The authors reviewed over 7,000 studies of the incidence 
and prevalence of co-morbidities in MS including 249 studies, from 1905 through 2012, which 
underwent detailed review and on which the six reported meta-analyses were based (Marrie 2015). 
Only 32% of studies were considered as of moderate to good quality and heterogeneity was high.

Despite  these  limitations  some  general  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  this  body  of 
work (Culpepper 2015): 
•  the  five  most  prevalent  co-morbidities  in  MS  were:  depression  (Marrie  2015b),  anxiety 
(Marrie 2015b),  hypertension  (Marrie  2015c),  hypercholesterolemia  (Marrie  2015c)  and 
chronic lung disease; 
•  autoimmune  thyroid  disease  and  psoriasis  were  the  most  frequent  co-morbid  autoimmune 
diseases (Marrie 2015e); 
•  the  risk  of  meningiomas  and  urinary  system  cancers  was  greater  and  the  risk  of  pancreatic, 
ovarian,  prostate  and  testicular  cancers  was  lower  than  expected  compared  to  the  general 
population (Marrie 2015f); 
•  several co-morbid conditions were found to occur more frequently than previous research had 
suggested,  such  as  stroke  (Marrie  2015c),  heart  disease  (Marrie  2015c),  congestive  heart 
failure (Marrie 2015c), arthritis (Marrie 2015d), inflammatory bowel disease (Marrie 2015e), 
irritable  bowel  syndrome  (Marrie  2015d),  seizure  disorders  (Marrie  2015g),  sleep 
disorders (Marrie 2015g),  bipolar  disorder 
(Marrie  et  al.,  2015b),  and  alcohol 
abuse (Marrie 2015b). 
The epidemiology of disease specific co-morbidities and other conditions frequently observed in 
MS patients should be taken into consideration for assessment of adverse event (AE) causality as 
summarized  in  Table  3.  The  main  co-medications  prescribed  for  these  co-morbidities  are  also 
presented in the table.

people  with  multiple  sclerosis  as  compared  to  the  general  population 
have  been  inconsistent.  The  meta-analysis  included  11  comparative 
studies of the risk of overall cancer in MS versus the general population 
(Marrie  2015f)  with  inconclusive  results.  Most  of  the  studies  (n=6) 
presented  no  statistical  difference  between  the  two  groups  (Achiron 
2005;  Midgard  1996b,  Moller  1991,  Nielsen  2008,  Sumelahti  2004,

in  MS  as  compared  to  the  general  population  (Christiansen  2010; 
Bahmanyar 2009; Kingwell 2012, Lebrun 2011). A nationwide Danish 
register-based  study  the  incidence  of  cancer  was  5.76  per  1,000 
person-years  (Norgaard 2019).  MS  patients  did  not  have  increased 
cancer incidence than general population, with a standardized incidence 
ratio of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90–1.06) for any cancer (Norgaard 2019). 
In  population-based  studies,  cancers  that  had  the  highest  incidence 
were cervical (summary estimate: 2.95 [0.005-0.58], breast (summary

Module SII - Non-clinical Part of the Safety Specification  
The key safety findings from the non-clinical program and their relevance to clinical use in humans 
are presented in Table 4.

Key Safety Findings From Non-clinical Studies and Relevance to Human 
Usage  
Key Safety Findings (from Non-clinical Studies) 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Single and repeat-dose toxicity: 
Based on the results from single and repeat-dose 
toxicity  studies,  no  significant  toxicity  other  than 
effects consistent with the mechanism of action of 
cladribine (e.g. lymphopenia) are anticipated. 
Single and repeat-dose toxicity: 
Toxicological  evaluations  of  cladribine  by  the  intravenous  (iv), 
subcutaneous  (sc)  and  oral  routes  revealed  target  organs  of 
toxicity  as  expected  from  its  pharmacological  mode  of  action. 
The primary target organs at toxicologically relevant levels were 
tissues/organs  in  the  lymphoid  and  myeloid  system  (spleen, 
thymus,  lymph  nodes,  bone  marrow)  including  decreases  of 
lymphocytes  and  red  blood  cell  parameters.  No  toxic  effects 
were observed when cladribine was administered by oral route 
up to 20 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 6 mg/kg/day in monkeys, 
respectively,  in  chronic  and  sub-chronic  studies.  The  daily 
exposure  associated  to  these  No-Observed-Adverse-Effect 
Levels  (NOAELs)  exceeded  the  daily  human  exposure  at  the 
maximum  oral  clinical  dose  (20  mg/day)  of  at  least  1.95  fold 
based on area under the curve (AUC). 
Reproductive toxicity: 
Cladribine did not affect fertility in male or female mice. However, 
cladribine  induced  testicular  changes  (reduced  testes  weights 
and increased number of non-motile sperm) without detrimental 
effects  on  fertility.  The  NOAEL  for  testicular  changes  in  the 
 Testicular effects 
fertility study in male mice was set at
and  changes  in  sperm  parameters  were  also  seen  in  monkey 
repeat-dose studies.  
Cladribine  was  shown  to  be  embryolethal  and  induced  fetal 
malformations  in  mice  and  rabbits  after  iv  administration 
  The 
NOAEL for fetal effects in the embryofetal toxicity studies were 
0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day respectively in mice and rabbits.  
Skeletal anomalies were also observed in the pre- and postnatal 
toxicity study in mice at ≥1.5 mg/kg/day by iv route (NOAEL for 
fetal  effects  was  0.5  mg/kg/day).  No  effects  were  detected  on 
reproductive  functions  or  general  performance  of  the  F1 
generation.  No  effect  was  observed  on  the  fetuses  of  the  F2 
generation. The NOAEL for maternal reproductive function and 
general toxicity was set at 3 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for offspring 
development was set at 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
Pregnancy, breastfeeding: 
Drugs  that  inhibit  desoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA) 
synthesis have been reported to be teratogenic in 
humans.  Therefore  and  due  to  the  teratogenicity 
observed  with  cladribine 
in  animal  studies, 
cladribine must not be used in pregnant women. In 
women of childbearing potential, pregnancy must 
be  excluded  before  the  initiation  of  cladribine  in 
year  1  and  year 2,  and  prevented  by  use  of 
effective contraception during cladribine treatment 
and  for at  least 6 months  after  the  last  dose.  On 
the  basis  of  data  from  the  reproductive  toxicity 
studies  in  animals,  potential  consequences  on 
human  testes  cannot  be  excluded.  As  cladribine 
interferes with DNA synthesis, adverse effects on 
human  gametogenesis could be  expected,  male-
mediated  developmental  toxicity  cannot  be  ruled 
out.  Male  patients  must 
take  precautionary 
measures  to  prevent  pregnancy  of  their  partner 
least 
during  cladribine  treatment  and 
6 months after the last dose of cladribine.

Nephrotoxicity: 
Karyomegaly of renal tubular epithelium was observed in a one 
year  subcutaneous  toxicity  study  in  monkeys  at  the  dose  of  1 
mg/kg/day. Renal tubule degeneration /regeneration was seen 
in mice at the high dose of 30 mg/kg/day. With regards to the 
potential of HPβCD (excipient used in the proposed drug product 
formulation)  to  induce  nephrotoxic  effects,  it  is  reported  that 
many substituted cyclodextrins caused reversible vacuolation of 
the proximal renal tubular epithelium without evidence of kidney 
Nephrotoxicity: 
Non-clinical  findings  from  long-term  treatment  in 
monkeys  and  treatment  with  high  doses  in  mice 
have little relevance for the proposed posology in 
patients. As no safety data are available in patients 
with  moderate  to  severe  renal  impairment  and 
renal elimination is a major contributor to cladribine 
clearance, cladribine is contraindicated in patients

followed by a 23-day non-dosing period), followed by additional 
5 days of dosing, did not cause adverse renal effects. 
Hepatotoxicity: 
Changes in liver function were observed in a sub-chronic toxicity 
study in mice by subcutaneous route at the doses of 
 cladribine. These included mainly mild to moderately 
increased  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  aspartate  amino 
transaminase 
(ALP) 
activities.

Genotoxicity: 
Cladribine  is  incorporated  into  DNA  strands  and  inhibits  DNA 
synthesis and repair. Cladribine did not induce gene mutation in 
bacteria  or  mammalian  cells,  but  it  was  clastogenic  causing 
chromosomal  damage  in  mammalian  cells  in  vitro  at  a 
concentration  which  was  17-fold  above  the  expected  clinical 
Cmax. In vivo clastogenicity in mice was detected at 
Carcinogenicity:  
The carcinogenic potential of cladribine was assessed in a long-
term 22-month study with subcutaneous administration in mice 
and  in  a  short-term  26-week  study  by  oral  route  in  transgenic 
mice. In the long-term carcinogenicity study in mice, the highest

(apart from Harderian gland tumors, predominantly adenomas) 
was seen in mice. Harderian gland tumors are not considered to

anatomical structures.  
In the short-term carcinogenicity study in Tg rasH2 mice by oral

Hepatotoxicity: 
Although  the  effects  of  the  liver  function  after 
cladribine treatment is considered low in animals, 
based  on  the  current  accumulated  clinical  data, 
routine monitoring of liver parameters prior to start 
of Mavenclad in each treatment year is indicated. 
In  case  of  signs  or  symptoms  suggestive  for  a

parameters is advised and Mavenclad treatment to

Malignancy:  
Although  cladribine  may  have  a  potential  for

tg.rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study. 
General and safety pharmacology: 
favorable  safety 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  showed  a 
pharmacological profile of cladribine. In particular, no evidence 
was found that cladribine has any effect on the duration of the 
heart rate-corrected QT interval. In addition, the results of the 3 
month toxicology study in monkeys did not show any effect on 
the  duration  of  the  heart  rate-corrected  QT  interval  (Bazett) 
following  application  of  cladribine  at  doses  of 
Moreover, the nonclinical 
safety pharmacological results indicated the absence of adverse 
events  with  respect  to  the  CNS,  which  should  translate  into  a 
safe clinical use of cladribine in patients.  
Mechanisms for drug interactions: 
In  both  rat  and  human  hepatic  S9  fractions  and  microsomes, 
cladribine metabolism was low. The in vitro metabolism of 14C-
cladribine  using  primary  hepatocyte  cultures  confirmed  that 
cladribine  was  not  substantially  metabolized  in  humans.  The 
metabolism routes in human hepatocytes were also the principal 
routes  in  all  hepatocytes  from  the  pre-clinical  species  and  no 
unique  human  metabolite  was  found 
liver  microsomes  and  cultured 
Using  pooled  human 
hepatocytes,  there  was  no  evidence  of  inhibition  of  major 
cytochrome  (CYP)  P450  enzyme  activity  by  cladribine.  In 
addition, cladribine has shown no clinically meaningful inductive 
effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.  
Results  of safety  pharmacological  studies  do  not 
indicate a risk for cardiovascular toxicity in humans 
in particular for Torsade-de-Pointes arrhythmias.  
Non-clinical  studies  indicate  hepatic  metabolism 
as low; the compound is not a relevant substrate 
for CYP enzymes.  
In  conclusion  the  main  toxicities  observed  in  the  non-clinical  development  program  that  have 
relevance for use in humans are: 
Important identified risks 
•  Lymphopenia  (based  on  non-clinical  data;  severe  (≥grade  3)  lymphopenia  based  on  clinical 
data) 
Important potential risks 
•  Teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes

61 of these participants were followed for safety only from the start of the study (i.e. these  participants did not 
receive any treatment) 
1,183 patients were enrolled; 1,148 patients were included in the safety set whereof 950 participants had been 
exposed to cladribine in previous studies and 198 patients were never exposed to cladribine; Clinical Trial Report 
for the PREMIERE Registry, dated 12 April 2019) 
In general, the integrated safety analyses focused on specific cohorts (grouping of sets of studies) 
to characterize the safety profile of cladribine across all exposed participants and across a number 
of distinct populations. In this RMP, the frequencies and incidence rates of the important identified 
and potential risks as described in Part II, Module SVII.3 will be presented for the Monotherapy 
Oral cohort, focusing on the 3.5 mg/kg treatment group as this resembles most closely the target 
patient  population  and  the  posology  according  to  the  proposed  labeling  of  cladribine.  For  the 
potential risks of malignancies and teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes, data from the All 
Exposed cohort are presented in addition.  
These cohorts included the following safety data: 
Monotherapy  Oral  cohort:  includes  safety  data  from  all  studies  that  used  cladribine  as  oral 
monotherapy. 
All  Exposed  cohort:  includes  safety  data  from  all  Phase  2/3  studies  with  any  formulation  of 
cladribine.

Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials  
SIV.1 
Exclusion  Criteria  in  Pivotal  Clinical  Studies  Within  the 
Development Program  
Pregnant or breastfeeding females  
Reason for  exclusion:  Excluding pregnant  or breastfeeding  females  is  a standard precautionary 
measure that is often applied in clinical trials.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Cladribine was shown to be embryolethal when administered to pregnant mice, and the 
compound  was  teratogenic  in  mice  and  rabbits  (Module  SII).  Furthermore,  cladribine  inhibits 
DNA synthesis and other drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis are known to be teratogenic. Therefore, 
use during pregnancy is contraindicated and use of effective contraception during treatment and 
for 6 months after the last dose of cladribine is recommended in women of childbearing potential 
and in male patients to prevent pregnancy of their partner. Breastfeeding is contraindicated during 
cladribine treatment and for 1 week after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in breast-fed infants. 
Teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes is considered an important potential risk of cladribine. 
The  risk  will  be  further  quantified  in  the  CLEAR  study  (Pregnancy  Post-Authorization  Safety 
Study [PASS]) (Part III) and the safety concern will continue to be monitored in clinical use.  
Patients with renal impairment 
Reason  for  exclusion:  Patients  with  clinically  significant  renal  disease  were  excluded  as  a 
precautionary measure considering the renal elimination of cladribine. No dedicated studies have 
been conducted in patients with renal impairment.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Renal clearance of cladribine has been shown to be dependent on creatinine clearance. 
While  no  dose  adjustment  is  considered  necessary  in  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment 
(creatinine  clearance  60  to  89  mL/min),  use  of  cladribine  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) and therefore use is not 
expected.

Pediatric patients (below 18 years)  
Reason  for  exclusion:  The  target  population  in  the  clinical  trials  were  adults  of  the  age  range 
18 - 65 years. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: In May 2009, the EU Pediatric Committee (PDCO) granted Merck a full waiver not to 
conduct studies in all categories of pediatric patients. This product specific waiver was confirmed 
by the Agency in April 2015.  
Patients with compromised immunocompetences  
Reason for exclusion: Patients with compromised immunocompetences were excluded from the 
clinical trials as a precautionary measure considering cladribine’s immunosuppressive effect. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.  
Rationale: Initiation of cladribine treatment is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, 
including patients currently receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy. 
Patients with hypersensitivity to cladribine  
Reason  for  exclusion:  Excluding  patients  with  hypersensitivity  to  the  investigational  medicinal 
product is a standard precautionary measure that is often applied in clinical trials.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Similar to all medicinal products use of cladribine is contraindicated in patients who 
are hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients. It is unlikely that patients 
with a known hypersensitivity will receive cladribine in clinical practice.  
Patients with chronic infections  
Reason for exclusion: Patients with chronic infections were excluded as a precautionary measure 
considering cladribine’s immunosuppressive effect.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Cladribine is recognized to reduce the body’s immune defense and may increase the 
likelihood of infections. Therefore, chronic infections are a recognized risk with cladribine and 
use  of  cladribine  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  active  chronic  infection  (tuberculosis  or 
hepatitis) or with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tuberculosis is an important 
identified risk, and severe infections, PML and opportunistic infections (other than tuberculosis 
and PML) are important potential risks. All of these important risks will be further quantified in 
the  CLARION  study  (long-term  PASS)  (Part  III)  and  the  safety  concern  will  continue  to  be 
monitored in clinical use.

RMP on Mavenclad® (Cladribine) Version No. 2.2, DLP 07 Jul 2023 
Patients with hepatic impairment  
Reason  for  exclusion:  Excluding  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  is  a  standard  precautionary 
measure that is often applied in clinical trials.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.  
Rationale: Hepatic metabolism is considered negligible for cladribine; the clearance of cladribine 
in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  should  not  be  impacted.  Therefore,  no  studies  have  been 
conducted in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The product labeling provides 
this information along with a non-recommendation for the treatment of patients with moderate to 
severe  hepatic  impairment.  No  additional  risk  minimization  measures  are  deemed  necessary. 
Regarding pharmacovigilance, the number of patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
in observational studies is expected to be low, and thus would not allow any meaningful analyses. 
Therefore, no additional pharmacovigilance measures seem feasible and no additional measures 
beyond routine risk management are planned.  
Elderly (above 65 years) 
Reason for exclusion: Elderly patients over the age of 65 years were excluded from the clinical 
trials to standardize the study population to adults so that efficacy and safety could be evaluated 
in this target population. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.  
Rationale: No studies have been conducted in elderly patients. As per product labeling caution is 
recommended when Mavenclad is used in elderly patients, taking into account the potential greater 
frequency  of  decreased  hepatic  or  renal  function,  concomitant  diseases  and  other  medicinal 
therapies in the older age group. The number of elderly patients currently included in the ongoing 
CLARION (long-term PASS) is low, and thus will not allow any meaningful analyses. However, 
a cumulative  analysis of safety data in  elderly  from  817  individual case  reports in  the PBRER 
covering the period 08 July 2022 to 07 July 2023 showed that the pattern of AEs in elderly patients 
was consistent with the known safety profile of Mavenclad in the overall population. No additional 
measures beyond routine risk management are deemed necessary. 
Patients with cardiac impairment  
Reason  for  exclusion:  Excluding  patients  with  cardiac  impairment  is  a  standard  precautionary 
measure that is often applied in clinical trials. The exclusion criterion for patients  with cardiac 
impairment was not related to any cardiovascular toxicity of cladribine. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Cladribine is not known to be cardiotoxic based on non-clinical findings (Module SII) 
and experience in the clinical development program. The safety and efficacy of cladribine are not 
expected to be different in patients with cardiac impairment and accordingly no guidance is needed 
concerning use of cladribine in this population.  
35/89 
 
 
 
RMP on Mavenclad® (Cladribine) Version No. 2.2, DLP 07 Jul 2023 
Patients at risk of malignancy 
Reason for exclusion: As a precautionary measure considering the immunosuppressive effect of 
cladribine, patients with prior or current history of malignancy were excluded from the studies, 
with the exception of basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma in situ surgically removed without 
recurrence for at least five years prior to entry in the clinical studies.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes. Long-term safety data in particular 
for malignancy risk is an area of missing information. Malignancies are also an important potential 
risk  of  cladribine.  The  risk  will  be  further  quantified  in  the  CLARION  study  (Long-term 
PASS) (Part III) and will continue to be monitored in clinical use. 
SIV.2 
Limitations  to  Detect  Adverse  Reactions  in  Clinical  Trial 
Development Programs  
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as 
rare or very rare adverse reactions or adverse reactions with a long latency such as malignancies.  
A total of 1,976 patients received cladribine (all formulations, all Exposed Cohort) in Phase 2/3 
studies to date, amounting to an exposure of 9,855 patient-years. The mean and median time on 
study for these patients was approximately 260 and 269 weeks, respectively. The sample size of 
1,976 patients enables very common, common and uncommon adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to 
be detected. Across the MS program some of the patients have been followed up for more than 8 
years,  without  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  ADRs  with  a  long  induction  time  such  as 
malignancies.

Pregnant women 
Despite  precautionary  measures  to  prevent  pregnancy  in  clinical  trials, 
pregnancies  did  occur  in  clinical  trials  with  cladribine.  The  number  of 
pregnancies reported including their outcome is provided in Table 13. Among 
49 pregnancies in 43 women treated with cladribine 16 pregnancies occurred 
during administration of cladribine or within 183 days (i.e. 6 months) after last 
dose  of cladribine.  Three  out of  these 16  pregnancies  resulted  in  3  healthy 
newborns,  10  pregnancies  were  terminated  by  an  induced  abortion  per 
decision of the patient, there were 2 spontaneous abortions and 
.  
Overall,  in  the  program  11  pregnancies  were  reported  following  paternal 
exposure  to  cladribine  (reference:  cohort  All  Exposed).  Two  pregnancies 
occurred in the placebo arm and 9 in the cladribine exposed arm. For 2 of the 
partner  pregnancies  the  conception  occurred  during  administration  of 
cladribine or within 183 days (i.e. 6 months) after last dose of cladribine. These 
pregnancies resulted in 2 healthy newborns. 
Overall, there was no imbalances in pregnancy outcomes between cladribine- 
and placebo-treated participants. There were no congenital malformations in

Patients with hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were not included in the 
clinical development program including patients with serum bilirubin, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or hepatic alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) elevated to two and a half times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN)  range.  No  dedicated  studies  have  been  conducted  in  patients  with 
hepatic impairment. A small number of patients with some degree of hepatic 
impairment at baseline in the CLARITY study did not have any worse safety 
outcome  as  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  study  population.  Although  the 
importance of hepatic function for the elimination of cladribine is considered 
negligible,  its  use  is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Patients  with  a  clinically  significant  renal  disease  were  excluded  from  the 
studies.  No  dedicated  studies  have  been  conducted  in  patients  with  renal 
impairment. In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to 
89  mL/min),  no  dosage  adjustment  is  considered  necessary.  As  the  safety 
profile of cladribine in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment has 
not been established and renal elimination is a major contributor to cladribine 
clearance,  cladribine  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min).

Exposure 
Patients with cardiovascular impairment 
Patients  with  clinically  significant  cardiac  disease,  such  as  angina  pectoris, 
congestive  heart  failure  or  arrhythmias,  were  not  included  in  the  clinical 
development program. As non-clinical safety data did not indicate a potential 
for  cardiovascular  toxicity  and  available  clinical  data  does  not  provide 
evidence for a potential risk of cardiotoxicity, a contraindication /precaution is 
not warranted in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. 
Immunocompromised patients 
Due to cladribine’s immunosuppressive effect, patients with a history of active 
or  chronic  infectious  disease  or  any  disease  that  compromises  immune 
function  were  excluded  from  the  clinical  development  program.  Prior  or 
concomitant use of immunosuppressive therapy was also excluded during the 
clinical  studies.  Initiation  of  cladribine  treatment  is  contraindicated  in 
immunocompromised  patients, 
receiving 
immunosuppressive  or  myelosuppressive  therapy.  Cladribine  treatment  is 
also contraindicated in patients with active chronic infections (tuberculosis or 
hepatitis) and with HIV infections. Screening for latent infections, in particular 
tuberculosis  and  hepatitis  B  and  C,  must  be  performed  prior  to  initiation  of 
therapy in year 1 and year 2. Initiation of cladribine should be delayed until the 
infection has been adequately treated. A delay in initiation of cladribine should 
also be considered in patients with an acute infection until the infection is fully 
controlled.

Patients at risk of malignancy 
Patients  with  prior  or  current  history  of  malignancy  were  excluded  from  the 
studies, with the exception of basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma in situ 
surgically removed without recurrence for at least five years prior to entry into 
the clinical studies. Considering cladribine’s immunosuppressive effects, the 
risk  of  a  potential  reactivation  or  development  of  a  malignancy  cannot  be 
excluded.  The  use  of  cladribine  in  patients  with  active  malignancies  is 
contraindicated.  An  individual  benefit-risk  evaluation  should  be  performed 
before  initiating  cladribine  in  patients  with  prior  malignancy  and  standard 
cancer  screening  guidelines  should  be  followed  in  patients  treated  with 
cladribine.

Part II: 
Module SV - Post-Authorisation Experience  
In the US a New Drug Application (NDA) submission was made on 27 May 2010 for cladribine 
tablets with a proposed indication of the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) (NDA 
22-561), a Complete Response Letter (CRL) was received on 28 February 2011 and subsequently 
the NDA was withdrawn by the Sponsor on 19 August 2011. In addition, a negative opinion from 
the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) was received in January 2011. 
In June of that year, and in absence of additional data to allow regulatory agencies to re-assess the 
benefit/risk ratio, the Sponsor announced they would no longer pursue the worldwide approval of 
cladribine tablets. Consequently, the product under the tradename MOVECTRO was withdrawn 
from  the  approved  markets,  Australia  and  Russia,  and  all  ongoing  marketing  authorization 
applications  (MAAs)  in  other  countries  were  withdrawn.  However,  the  Sponsor  decided  to 
continue the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that were ongoing at the time, including the collection of 
long-term safety data to support a thorough characterization of the safety profile of cladribine, and 
thus establish a proper benefit/risk assessment for the treatment of RMS. 
Following  the  availability  of  new  clinical  data,  a  new  MAA  was  filed  in  the  EU  in  June  2016 
followed MAAs in other countries. Cladribine (Mavenclad) received approval from the European 
Commission  on 22 August 2017 for the treatment  of adult patients  with highly  active RMS as 
defined by clinical or imaging features (Mavenclad Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]). 
Mavenclad  was  granted  approval  by  the  FDA  on  29  March  2019.  Mavenclad  is  currently 
authorized in 92 countries and marketed in 81 of these.

Post-Authorisation Exposure  
Method Used to Calculate Exposure  
Internal sales data have been used as the source to estimate the exposure of patients to cladribine. 
A total 1,497,898 tablets were sold over the period from 01 September 2017 until 30 June 2023. 
Taking the number of sold tablets into account, the patient exposure was calculated based on the 
following estimations: 
•  Patient compliance to cladribine is 98% during the first year course and 93% during the second-
year course of treatment. Compliance is defined as completing treatment in the first treatment 
year and in the second treatment year. If a patient stops treatment, regardless of the reason, it is 
considered not compliant. 
•  Each patient receives a mean number of 11.2 tablets of 10 mg in the 2 weeks of treatment in 
Year 1 and as well in Year 2 considering that he/she is fully compliant.  
•  The 2 weeks treatment per yearly treatment take place during the same year. 
•  In the first year following the launch of Mavenclad, sold tablets were only used by patients in 
their first treatment year.  
39/89 
 
 
 
RMP on Mavenclad® (Cladribine) Version No. 2.2, DLP 07 Jul 2023 
•  In the second and following years after launch, sold tablets were used by patients in their first 
treatment year as well as by previously exposed patients who initiated their second treatment 
year.  
For  the  calculation  of  the  cumulative  exposure  in  the  period  from  01  September  2017  until 
30 June 2023 only the tablets sold for patients who initiated the first treatment year in that period 
are considered. The number of tablets used by patients who received their year 2 treatment are not 
considered, as they are related to returning patients already included in the calculation. 
SV.1.2 
Exposure  
The cumulative post-authorization exposure to  Mavenclad  since marketing authorization in  the 
EU (22 August 2017) until 30 June 2023 is estimated to be 78,613 patients (Periodic Benefit-Risk 
Evaluation  Report  [PBRER]  for  the  period  08 July  2022  to  07  July  2023).  As  calculations  are 
performed quarterly, this period does not entirely coincident with the reporting period; however, 
it provides an adequate estimation of patient exposure.  
In addition, a maximum of 153 patients were exposed to cladribine when the product was marketed 
in Russia and Australia with the brand name MOVECTRO in the years 2011 and 2012 (Periodic 
Safety Update Reports [PSURs] no. 1-3). As these data are not reflective of Mavenclad, these data 
are not considered further.

Details  of  Important  Identified  Risks,  Important  Potential 
Risks, and Missing Information  
Safety data from the development program  
Illustrations of AEs mainly focus on reporting by observation-adjusted adverse event incidence 
rates (Adj-AE) in the cladribine exposed participants compared to placebo group, defined as: 
Adj-AE per 100-Patient-years (PY) = 100*(Number of participants with at least an AE)/ Sum of 
observation  time  in  days  among  participants  at  risk  for  initial  occurrence  of  an  AE  or  time  on 
study/365.25). Adj-AE will be expressed per 100 observation years, i.e. the Adj-AE for a specific 
AE will be multiplied by 100. 
Incidence rates are generally reported for the Monotherapy Oral cohort, cladribine treatment group 
3.5 mg/kg vs. placebo. (Please note, that with the availability of the final report of the PREMIERE 
registry  in  April  2019,  the  data  in  this  section  were  recalculated)  In  addition,  AE  frequencies 
observed in the CLARITY trial are presented for the important identified risks as these frequencies 
served as reference for the assignment to frequency categories in the product labeling. 
Accordingly, for the assessment of seriousness and severity of each identified and potential risk, 
the Monotherapy Oral cohort (cladribine treatment group 3.5 mg/kg vs placebo) has been used as 
reference. 
For the potential risks of malignancies, teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes, data from the 
All Exposed cohort are provided in addition. 
Safety data from postapproval sources 
For each safety concern, safety data from postapproval sources is provided by the cutoff date of

Important Identified Risk: Severe (Grade ≥3) Lymphopenia 
Evidence source and strength 
of evidence  
The safety of cladribine was studied in all clinical trials that evaluated oral cladribine 
monotherapy 3.5 mg/kg (923 patients) and in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that 
evaluated  oral,  intravenous  and  subcutaneous  cladribine  in  different  treatment 
regimens (1,976 patients).  
Severe lymphopenia is considered an important identified risk as it may increase 
the  risk  of  infections,  especially  for  herpes  zoster,  and  needs  to  be  managed  in 
clinical practice through lymphocyte count monitoring before and during cladribine 
treatment.  Data  from  clinical  trials  can  provide  an  accurate  estimate  of  the 
frequency and nature of severe (Grade ≥3) lymphopenia that is expected to occur 
in clinical practice.

46 cases were associated with infections (67 AEs [40 serious and 27 nonserious]). 
Serious coreported infections occurring more than once included COVID-19 (n=5), 
urinary  tract  infection  (n=4),  COVID-19  pneumonia,  subcutaneous  abscess  and 
urosepsis (n=2, each). None of the coreported infections had a fatal outcome. 
The  outcome  of  serious  lymphopenia  events  was  reported  as  resolved  (n=20), 
resolved  with  sequelae  (n=2),  resolving  (n=33),  not  resolved  (n=40),  and 
unknown/not reported (n=57). 
Note: Serious lymphopenia is provided instead of severe lymphopenia, as severity 
is often not reported in the postapproval setting. 
Because  of  the  dose-response  observed  in  the  clinical  trials,  doses  higher  than 
3.5 mg/kg  of  cladribine  appear  to  be  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  severe 
lymphopenia.  Higher  incidences  of  severe  lymphopenia  were  also  seen  in 
combination treatment with IFN-β. 
While lymphopenia is essential for the therapeutic action of cladribine in MS, severe 
lymphopenia  should  be  avoided.  Severe  lymphopenia  may  be  preventable  by 
careful monitoring of lymphocyte counts prior to each treatment course. Participants 
are  only  allowed  to  start  cladribine  treatment  in  Year  1  if  they  have  normal 
lymphocyte counts. Cladribine treatment in Year 2 is restricted to participants with 
normal ALC or lymphopenia Grade 1. In case of lymphopenia Grade ≥2, treatment 
in Year 2 can be delayed for up to 6 months to allow for a recovery of lymphocyte 
counts.  
Additional risk minimization measures are described in Part V, V.2.

Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Important Identified Risk: Severe (Grade ≥3) Lymphopenia 
Patients  with  severe  lymphopenia  may  be  at  an  increased  risk  of  infections 
especially for herpes zoster. Overall, the clinical benefit of cladribine for treating a 
debilitating  condition  is  considered  to  outweigh  the  risk  of  severe  (Grade  ≥3) 
lymphopenia  that  can  be  managed  in  clinical  practice  through  monitoring 
lymphocytes, actively monitoring for signs and symptoms suggestive of infections, 
and using prophylactic medications and/or treatment where indicated.  
The risk of severe (Grade ≥3) lymphopenia will be further characterized in patients 
exposed to cladribine in the ongoing CLARION study (long-term Post-Authorization 
Safety  Study  [PASS])  but  this  is  unlikely  to  impact  the  risk-benefit  balance  of 
cladribine. 
Public health impact  
There is no public health risk posed.  
Potential mechanism 
The risk of herpes zoster in patients treated with cladribine is likely related  to the 
severity and duration of lymphopenia. 
Important Identified Risk: Herpes Zoster 
Evidence source and strength 
of evidence 
The safety of cladribine was studied in all clinical trials that evaluated oral cladribine 
monotherapy 3.5 mg/kg (923 patients) and in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that 
evaluated  oral,  intravenous  and  subcutaneous  cladribine  in  different  treatment 
regimens (1,976 patients).  
Herpes zoster is considered an important identified risk as the pain associated with 
herpes zoster can be debilitating, particularly in the elderly. Data from clinical trials 
can provide an accurate estimate of the frequency and nature of herpes zoster that 
is expected to occur in clinical practice.

Important Identified Risk: Herpes Zoster 
Severity/Seriousness/outcomes 
Clinical Data - Cohort Monotherapy Oral  
Out of 31 AEs of herpes zoster reported for 28 participants treated with cladribine, 
3  were  considered  serious;  all  of  these  events  resolved.  Of the  6  AEs  of  herpes 
zoster  reported  for  4  participants  who  received  placebo,  none  were  considered 
serious.  One  patient  each  in  the  placebo  group  and  in  the  cladribine  group 
experienced a severe AE of herpes zoster, otherwise herpes zoster was of mild to 
moderate severity.  
There was only one case of cladribine treatment discontinuation due to a herpes 
zoster in the Monotherapy Oral Cohort, cladribine treatment group 3.5 mg/kg. 
Across  the  program,  there  was  also  no  case  of  systemic,  serious  disseminated 
herpes  zoster.  Three  cases  involving  the  skin  only  and  coded  as  herpes  zoster 
disseminated  were  received.  All  of  them  were  reported  as  nonserious  and 
nonsevere. Two of them were seen in participants treated with cladribine and 1 was 
reported for a participant on placebo. 
Overall, in participants exposed to cladribine, the incidence of herpes zosters was 
higher during the period of Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia compared to the time when 
the  participants  were  not  experiencing  Grade  3  or  4  lymphopenia.  For  the 
Monotherapy Oral Cohort, the Adj.-AE rate for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg treatment 
group  was  2.08  with  Grade  3  or  4  lymphopenia  and  0.63  without  Grade  3  or  4 
lymphopenia.  
Source: ISS Update Analysis - Final version, Tables ISS 13.5.6.1a and 39.10.2.3a. 
Postapproval Data  
Cumulatively, out of 670 AEs of herpes zoster in 665 ICSRs in the postapproval 
setting, mainly AE of herpes zoster (n=638) was reported, followed by ophthalmic 
herpes zoster (n=18), genital herpes zoster (n=6), herpes zoster reactivation (n=4), 
herpes zoster meningitis, herpes zoster oticus, herpes zoster meningitis and herpes 
zoster meningoencephalitis (n=1, each). Overall, 48 of these AEs were serious, of 
which 28 had outcome reported as resolved, 7 as resolving, 3 as not resolved, and 
for 10 outcome was unknown or not reported. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Advanced age, immunosuppressive treatment. 
Preventability 
The  risk  of  herpes  zoster  may  be  mitigated  by  early  identification  of  severe 
lymphopenia with careful monitoring of lymphocyte counts prior to each treatment 
course; 2 and 6 months after start of treatment in each treatment year; if ALC is 
≥Grade  3,  patients  should  be  actively  monitored  for  lymphocyte  counts  and 
infections  until  values  increase  again.  Participants  are  only  allowed  to  start 
cladribine treatment in Year 1 if they have normal lymphocyte counts. Cladribine 
treatment  in  Year  2  is  restricted  to  participants  with  normal  ALC  or  lymphopenia 
Grade 1. In case of lymphopenia Grade ≥2, treatment in Year 2 can be delayed for 
up  to  6 months  to  allow  for  a  recovery  of  lymphocyte  counts.  The  risk  of  herpes 
zoster  can  further  be  mitigated  by  vaccination  and  consideration  of  antiherpes 
prophylaxis in patients with Grade 4 lymphopenia.

Important Identified Risk: Herpes Zoster 
Dermatomal herpes zoster, identified as an adverse reaction of cladribine, is mainly 
non-serious  and  non-severe  and  manageable  with  standard  of  care  treatment. 
Cladribine has been shown to be effective at treating adult patients with relapsing 
through  reducing  relapse  rates  and  delaying  disease 
multiple  sclerosis, 
progression,  especially  in  patients  with  highly  active  disease.  Overall  the  clinical

The risk of herpes zoster will be further characterized in patients exposed to

Important Identified Risk: Tuberculosis 
The  occurrence  of  tuberculosis  as  an  opportunistic  infection  is  dependent  on 
immunosuppression.  The  risk  of  tuberculosis  in  patients  treated  with  cladribine 
could  be  influenced  by  the  severity  and  duration  of  lymphopenia  as  well  as  the 
proportion of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. 
The safety of cladribine was studied in all clinical trials that evaluated oral cladribine 
monotherapy 3.5 mg/kg (923 patients) and in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that 
evaluated  oral,  intravenous  and  subcutaneous  cladribine  in  different  treatment 
regimens (1,976 patients).  
Tuberculosis is considered an important identified risk as it is a serious infectious 
disease that might occur when patients are immunosuppressed. For rare events 
such  as  tuberculosis  further  long-term  data  are  required  for  an  accurate

Seriousness/outcomes 
Clinical Data  
Cohort Monotherapy Oral  
2  participants  assigned  to  the  cladribine  3.5 mg/kg  group  experienced  serious 
infections of tuberculosis.  
One case resulted in death. This participant died due to tuberculosis approximately 
6 months after initial and last dose of cladribine (actual dose at onset of the event: 
0.84 mg/kg). Prolonged use of solumedrol for MS  was considered a contributing 
factor.  The  event  occurred  prior  to  the  implementation  of  pre-screening  for 
tuberculosis at baseline in the protocols. The second patient recovered from the 
tuberculosis infection. 
 Overall, in the program, there was a third case of tuberculosis in patient treated 
with a cumulative dose of oral cladribine of 7.3 mg/kg. The event resolved. All the 
events of tuberculosis emerged from countries where tuberculosis is endemic.  
Postapproval Data 
Most TB events in the 26 cases (26 AEs) were nonserious (n=18) with no clinical 
signs  or  symptoms.  The  majority  of  events  (n=19)  were  reported  as  Latent 
tuberculosis  (2  were  SAEs),  while  the  7  remaining  events  were  coded  to  PT: 
Tuberculosis  (6  serious  and  1  nonserious  [described  as  “suspected  TB”]). 
Reactivation of TB was specified in 1 of the serious cases. The outcome of TB was 
reported as resolved for 5 AEs, resolving for 1 AE, not resolved for 5 AEs, and not 
reported/unknown for 15 AEs.  
Risk factors and risk groups

Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Public health impact  
The risk of experiencing tuberculosis may be prevented by early identification of 
severe  lymphopenia  with  careful  monitoring  of  lymphocyte  counts  prior  to  each 
treatment course, 2 and 6 months after start of treatment in each treatment year; if 
ALC is ≥Grade 3, patients should be actively monitored for lymphocyte counts and 
infections  until  values  increase  again.  Participants  are  only  allowed  to  start 
cladribine treatment in Year 1 if they have normal lymphocyte counts. Cladribine 
treatment in Year 2 is restricted to participants with normal ALC or lymphopenia 
Grade 1. In case of lymphopenia Grade ≥2, treatment in Year 2 can be delayed for 
up to 6 months to allow for a recovery of lymphocyte counts. 
In  addition,  active  tuberculosis  is  a  contraindication  for  treatment  with  cladribine 
and  must  be  excluded  before  initiation  of  cladribine.  Therefore,  screening  for  a 
latent infection of tuberculosis is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy in Year 1 
and Year 2. 
Additional risk minimization measures are described in Part V, V.2. 
Taking into account the implemented preventive measures and the small number 
of  TB  cases  in  ~78,613  patients  exposed  to  Mavenclad,  the  impact  on  the  risk-
benefit balance is currently considered as low. 
There may be a public health risk posed in case of tuberculosis during exposure to

chronic infections of tuberculosis and hepatitis are contraindications for treatment 
with cladribine and must be excluded before initiation of cladribine. Latent infections 
may  be  activated,  including  tuberculosis  and  hepatitis.  Therefore,  screening  for 
latent infections in particular tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C is mandatory prior 
to  initiation  of  therapy  in  Year  1  and  Year  2.  A  delay  in  initiation  of  cladribine

PML  is  considered  an  important  potential  risk  as  it  can  result  in  hospitalization, 
potentially be life-threatening and result in death. While PML was not observed in 
these clinical trials, cases of PML were reported for parenteral cladribine in patients

Postapproval Data 
As of 07 Jul 2023, cumulatively, 1 case of PML was reported in ~78,613 patients 
exposed to Mavenclad. The assessment of this case is hampered by unavailability 
of relevant data including an MRI examination shortly prior to the start of Cladribine 
treatment and lack of positivity of a CSF JC virus polymerase chain reaction test 
result. The case causality could also not definitely be attributed to cladribine since 
the patient was pretreated with other agents that are supposed to be involved in 
the occurrence of PML. Thus, the case has been classified as not suspected to be 
causally related to Mavenclad. PML cases have been reported in the past but these 
have  been  in  the  context  of  patients  with  leukemia  treated  with  a  parenteral 
formulation of cladribine (i.e. not Mavenclad) using a different treatment regimen.

to participants with normal ALC or lymphopenia Grade 1. In case of lymphopenia 
Grade ≥2, treatment in Year 2 can be delayed for up to 6 months to allow for a 
recovery of lymphocyte counts. 
A baseline MRI should be considered before initiating cladribine treatment.  
Additional risk minimization measures are described in Part V, V.2.

Public health impact  
As only 1 case of PML has been reported in ~78,613 exposed patients which could 
not be causally attributed to Mavenclad, the impact on the risk-benefit balance is 
currently considered as very low  
Considering  the  specific  nature  of  PML  an  impact  on  the  public  health  is  not

Important Potential Risk: Opportunistic Infections other than PML and Tuberculosis   
Potential mechanism 
Evidence source and strength 
of evidence 
The  occurrence of  opportunistic  infections  is  dependent  on immunosuppression. 
The potential risk of opportunistic infections in patients treated with cladribine could 
be influenced by the severity and duration of lymphopenia as well as the proportion 
of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. 
The safety of cladribine was studied in all clinical trials that evaluated oral cladribine 
monotherapy 3.5 mg/kg (923 patients) and in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that 
evaluated  oral,  intravenous  and  subcutaneous  cladribine  in  different  treatment 
regimens (1,976 patients). 
Opportunistic  infections  (other  than  tuberculosis  and  PML)  are  considered  an 
important potential risk as they can result in hospitalization and may potentially be 
life-threatening and result in death. For uncommon events such as opportunistic 
infections  further long-term data  are  required  for  an  accurate  assessment  of  the 
risk; these will be characterized in the ongoing CLARION study (long-term PASS).

Severity/Seriousness/outcomes 
Clinical Data - Cohort Monotherapy Oral  
Of the 22 unique AEs of opportunistic infections (other than tuberculosis and PML) 
reported  from  10  patients  who  received  cladribine  3.5 mg/kg,  none  were 
considered serious and none were severe. Of the 4 unique AEs  of opportunistic 
infections reported from 4 patients who received placebo, none considered serious 
but one was considered severe. 
The majority of events resolved.  
Postapproval Data 
Of  the  22  events,  18  were  serious  and  4  were  nonserious.  For  SAEs,  the  most 
common PTs were Herpes ophthalmic (n=6) and Infection susceptibility increased 
(n=2). Other SAEs were reported once each: meningomyelitis herpes, esophageal 
candidiasis, nocardiosis, ophthalmic herpes simplex, histoplasmosis disseminated, 
pneumonia  cryptococcal,  cytomegalovirus  infection,  pulmonary  histoplasmosis, 
atypical mycobacterial pneumonia and meningitis cryptococcal. 
The outcomes of the 22 total events were resolved (n=4), resolving, not resolved

Age,  immunosuppressive  treatment,  presence  of  latent  infections  such  as 
tuberculosis, JCV, HBV, or HCV infections. 
Preventability 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
The  risk  of  experiencing  opportunistic  infections  may  be  prevented  by  early 
identification of severe lymphopenia with careful monitoring of lymphocyte counts 
prior  to  each  treatment  course,  2  and  6  months  after  start  of  treatment  in  each 
treatment  year;  if  ALC  is  ≥  Grade  3,  patients  should  be  actively  monitored  for 
lymphocyte counts and infections until values increase again. Participants are only 
allowed  to  start  cladribine  treatment  in  Year  1  if  they  have  normal  lymphocyte 
counts. Cladribine treatment in Year 2 is restricted to participants with normal ALC 
or lymphopenia Grade 1. In case of lymphopenia Grade ≥2, treatment in Year 2 
can be delayed for up to 6 months to allow for a recovery of lymphocyte counts. 
In  patients  experiencing  Grade  4  lymphopenia,  consideration  of  antiherpes 
prophylaxis is recommended.  
Additional risk minimization measures are described in Part V, V.2. 
Taking into account the very small number of opportunistic infections in ~78,613 
patients exposed to Mavenclad in the postapproval setting, the impact on the risk-
benefit balance is currently considered as low. 
Public health impact  
There may be a public health risk in case of contagious infections acquired during 
exposure to cladribine. 
Potential mechanism 
Immunosuppression caused by sustained, severe lymphopenia. 
Important Potential Risk: Malignancies

Postapproval Data 
As  of  07 Jul 2023,  cumulatively,  285  ICSRs  (with  314  AEs)  of  malignancies 
(i.e. “Malignant tumors [SMQ]-Narrow scope”) in ~78,613 exposed patients were 
reported from all postapproval sources and Phase 4 interventional studies (crude 
cumulative incidence: 0.004). 
PTs  for  the  most  frequently  reported  malignant  tumors (MedDRA PTs)  were 
Breast cancer, Basal cell carcinoma (n=30, both), Neoplasm malignant (n=21), 
Skin  cancer (n=18),  Malignant  melanoma  (n=13),  Invasive  ductal  breast 
carcinoma (n=10). 
In addition, 37 cases (with 38 AEs) of unspecified tumors were reported (i.e. not 
specified  if  benign  or  malignant).  Events  reported  at  least  twice  included 
neoplasm (n=10), thyroid neoplasm, brain neoplasm (n=4, each), lung neoplasm 
(n=3), neoplasm skin, renal neoplasm and bladder neoplasm (n=2, each). 
Severity/Seriousness/outcomes 
Clinical data 
Malignancies  in  the  clinical  development  program  of  oral  cladribine  were 
considered serious per protocol. Cancer outcome depends on e.g. the tumor type 
and location, stage at time of diagnosis, available treatment options, curability of 
the tumor etc. 
The  types  of  malignancies  observed  in  the  clinical  program  and  postapproval 
were typical of those observed in the general population. There was no clustering 
of  malignancies,  no  increase  in  virally  induced  malignancies,  hematological 
malignancies, or nonmelanoma skin cancers observed. 
Postapproval data  
The  outcome  of  the  314  malignancies  in  the  285  cases  was  resolved  (n=32), 
resolved with sequelae (n=1), resolving (n=14), not resolved (n=70), fatal (n=6), 
and unknown/not reported (n=191). In 5 cases, the malignant tumor had a fatal 
outcome  (PTs:  Lung  adenocarcinoma  [n=2],  Lung  cancer  metastatic,  Lung 
neoplasm  malignant,  and  Lung  carcinoma  cell  type  unspecified  stage  iv  [n=1, 
each]). 
The  outcome  of  the  38  unspecified  tumors  in  37  additional  cases  was 
resolved (n=3),  resolving (n=1),  not  resolved  (n=9),  and  unknown/not  reported 
(n=24).  The  remaining  1  unspecified  tumor  reported  outcome  as  fatal  (PT: 
Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis).

Important Potential Risk: Malignancies  
Cladribine  is  contraindicated  in  MS  patients  with  active  malignancies.  An 
individual benefit-risk evaluation should be performed before initiating cladribine 
in patients with prior malignancy. Patients treated with cladribine should follow 
standard cancer screening guidelines.  
Additional risk minimization measures are described in Part V, V.2. 
Malignancies are severe illnesses with potentially a fatal outcome. Cladribine has 
been  shown  to  be  effective  at  treating  adult  patients  with  relapsing  multiple 
sclerosis,  through  reducing  relapse  rates  and  delaying  disease  progression, 
especially  in  patients  with  highly  active  disease.  Overall  the  clinical  benefit  of 
cladribine for treating a debilitating condition is considered to outweigh the risk 
of malignancies. The risk of malignancies will be further characterized in patients 
exposed to cladribine in the ongoing CLARION study (long-term PASS), but this 
is unlikely to impact the risk-benefit balance of cladribine.

Important Potential Risk: Teratogenicity / Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes 
Potential mechanism: 
Evidence source and strength of 
evidence 
Cladribine  is  known  to  inhibit  DNA  synthesis.  Other  drugs  that  inhibit  DNA 
synthesis  were  reported  to  be  teratogenic.  Cladribine  was  shown  to  be 
embryolethal  when  administered  in  pregnant  mice,  and  the  compound  was 
teratogenic in mice and rabbits. 
Cladribine 
interferes  with  DNA  synthesis  and  could  cause  congenital 
malformations when used during pregnancy based on human experience with 
other  substances  inhibiting  DNA  synthesis.  Non-clinical  studies  have  also 
shown reproductive toxicity in the offspring of cladribine treated animals.  
Despite  precautionary  measures  to  prevent  pregnancy  in  clinical  trials, 
pregnancies  did  occur  during  cladribine  treatment  and  in  female  partners 
following paternal exposure to cladribine. There was no imbalance in pregnancy 
outcomes between cladribine- and placebo-treated participants and there were 
no  congenital  malformations  in  pregnancies  which  occurred  during  cladribine 
treatment or within 6 months after last dose. 
Teratogenicity/adverse  pregnancy  outcomes  are  considered  an  important 
potential risk as a teratogenic medicine may cause growth retardation, delayed 
mental development or other congenital disorders. The ongoing CLEAR study 
(pregnancy  PASS)  will  provide  data  on  pregnancies  and  infant  outcomes  in 
pregnant women with MS and in pregnancies fathered by men with MS exposed 
to oral cladribine treatment in routine clinical practice

Characterization of the risk 
Clinical Data  
All Exposed Cohort 
Patients who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from all studies and the 
use of adequate contraception was required in study participants. Nonetheless, 
across the cladribine clinical program in MS, 62 female participants experienced 
70  pregnancies  of  which  43 participants  treated  with  cladribine  had  49 
pregnancies and 19 participants treated with placebo had 21 pregnancies. Many 
of the pregnancies, which occurred during the study, were voluntarily terminated 
without  any  further  information  on  the  fetus.  Among  49  pregnancies  in  43 
women treated with cladribine 16 pregnancies occurred during administration of 
cladribine or within 183 days (i.e. 6 months) after last dose of cladribine. 3 out 
of these 16 pregnancies resulted in 3 healthy newborns, 10 pregnancies were 
terminated by an induced abortion per decision of the patient, in addition there 
were 2 spontaneous abortions and 1 medically indicated abortion. 
In  addition,  11  female  partners  of  male  study  participants  experienced  11 
pregnancies,  of  which  9 participants  were  treated  with  cladribine  and  2 
participants  received  placebo.  Two  of  the  9  male  participants  treated  with 
cladribine fathered a child during administration of cladribine or within 183 days 
(i.e.  6  months)  after  last  dose  of  cladribine.  These  pregnancies  resulted  in  2 
healthy newborns.  
Source:  ISS  Update  Analysis  -  Final  version,  Table  3:  Pregnancies  including 
female partner of male patients and information from the GPS Database 
Overall,  there  was  no  imbalance  in  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes  (e.g. 
spontaneous abortions)  in cladribine-  and  placebo-treated participants.  There 
were  no  congenital  malformations  in  pregnancies  which  occurred  during 
cladribine treatment or within 6 months after last dose.  
Postapproval Data 
Cumulatively,  333  unique  pregnancy  reports  were  received  (300  cases  of 
maternal exposure and 33 cases of pregnancies in women whose partner was 
treated  with  cladribine  [paternal  exposure])  for  patients  exposed  to  cladribine 
during pregnancy or within 6 months prior to pregnancy. In cases of maternal 
exposure,  pregnancy  outcomes  were  last  reported  as follows:  unknown/other 
(n=77), pending (n=105), live birth without congenital anomaly (CA) (n=70), live 
birth with CA (n=4, 1 major and 3 minor), spontaneous abortion (n=19), ectopic 
  and  elective 
pregnancy  (n=2), 
termination without fetal defects or unknown (n=22). In the 33 cases of paternal 
exposure, pregnancy outcomes were last reported as follows: pending (n=16), 
unknown  (n=8),  spontaneous  abortion (n=2),  and  live  birth  without  CA (n=7). 
Overall, there were no apparent trends in adverse pregnancy outcomes. 
The 1 major CA (PT: 
) was identified from a literature source 
.  A  female  patient  of 
unknown  age  was  exposed  to  Mavenclad  66  days  before  her  last  menstrual 
period. The authors reported that no clinical intervention was required. As no 
medical  history,  prior  or  concomitant  medications,  Mavenclad  dosing 
information, or event details were provided; the causality was not assessable by 
the Company.

Contraception:  All  efforts  should  be  made  in  order  to  prevent  pregnancies  in 
patients  treated  with cladribine  or  in  females  whose  partners  are treated  with 
cladribine to avoid potential adverse pregnancy outcomes as defined in Part V.1 
under  teratogenicity/adverse  pregnancy  outcomes.  At  the  beginning  of  each 
treatment year, counseling of patients regarding the potential risk for the fetus 
and  the  need  for  effective  contraception  is  recommended.  In  women  of 
childbearing  potential,  pregnancy  must  be  excluded  before  the  initiation  of 
cladribine in Year 1 and Year 2 and prevented by use of effective contraception 
during cladribine treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Women 
who  become  pregnant  under  therapy  with  oral  cladribine  should  discontinue 
treatment.  Male  patients  must  take  precautions  to  prevent pregnancy  of  their 
partner, during cladribine treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose.  
Additional risk minimization measures are described in Part V, V.2. 
Cladribine interferes with DNA synthesis and use during pregnancy may result 
in teratogenicity and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Cladribine has been shown 
to be effective at treating adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, through

pregnancy  outcomes  that can  be managed  in  clinical  practice  through  use of 
effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after last dose

After Cladribine Treatment 
Evidence source and strength of

Anticipated risk/ 
consequence of the missing 
information 
The long-term safety of cladribine was studied in the observational PREMIERE 
registry. However, safety data in patients receiving sequential treatment with 
other immunosuppressive  or immunomodulatory  agents after  treatment  with 
oral cladribine are limited. 
Cumulatively,  13  cases  with  immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory  agents 
administered  after  Mavenclad  treatment,  which  are  indicated  as  cosuspect 
drugs,  were  identified  from  postapproval  sources.  The  cosuspect  drugs 
included  apremilast, 
fingolimod,  ozanimod,  azathioprine,  methotrexate, 
natalizumab, ofatumumab, tacrolimus, and teriflunomide. Overall, 34 AEs (23 
nonserious  and  11  serious)  were  reported,  with  Lymphopenia  (n=4), 
Lymphocyte count decreased and Multiple sclerosis relapse (n=2, each) being 
the most common PTs. Of the 11 serious AEs, 7 were not suspected (unlikely) 
to be related to Mavenclad by the Company, 1 AE was not assessable and 3 
were likely to be related to Mavenclad (AEs=cellulitis, lower respiratory tract 
infection and white blood cell count decreased). 
In  71  cases,  it  was  not  specified  whether  the  use  of  the  cosuspect 
immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive agent was subsequent to Mavenclad 
treatment or not. 
The safety of cladribine in this population is unknown but a potential additive 
effect  on  the  immune  system  may  occur  when  immunosuppressive  or 
immunomodulatory  agents  are  used  after  treatment  with  cladribine.  Further 
collection of data relating to patients receiving sequential treatment with other 
immunosuppressive  or  immunomodulatory  agents  after  treatment  with  oral 
cladribine will be through collection and evaluation of spontaneous reports in

From the clinical program of cladribine in MS, there is limited experience from 
participants who have been previously treated with other immunomodulatory/ 
immunosuppressive agents. 
Cumulatively,  40  cases  with  immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive  agents 
administered  prior 
indicated  as 
cosuspect/concomitant  drugs,  were  identified  from  postapproval  sources. 
These cases described prior use of alemtuzumab, teriflunomide, fingolimod, 
dimethyl  fumarate,  interferon  beta-1a,  daclizumab,  ciclosporin,  natalizumab, 
ocrelizumab, 
infliximab  and  glatiramer  acetate.  Overall,  114 AEs 
(82 nonserious  and  32  serious)  were  reported,  with  MS  relapse  and 
lymphopenia being the most common AE (5 AEs, each). 2 of the SAEs were 
suspected  (likely)  to be  related  to  Mavenclad  (PTs:  Cellulitis  and  Dermatitis 
allergic). 
In  8 additional  cases,  it  was  not  specified  whether  the  use  of  the

information 
There is limited experience on the safety of cladribine in this but a potential 
additive effect on the immune system may occur when immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulatory  agents  are  used  prior  to  treatment  with  cladribine.  In 
addition  to  routine  pharmacovigilance,  the  impact  of  exposure  to  prior

Study short name and title: 
CLARION (Long-term PASS)  
Rationale and study objectives: 
This study aims at evaluating the safety profile, in terms of incidence of adverse events of special 
interest,  in  patients  with  highly  active  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (R[R]MS)  newly 
started  on  oral  cladribine  or  fingolimod.  The  study  will  also  assess  the  impact  of  prior  and 
subsequent  use  of  immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive  agents  on  the  incidence  of  adverse 
events of special interest. 
Study design: 
Multi-country, multi-center, long-term, based on a mix of primary data collection and secondary 
data, non-interventional PASS comparing patients with highly active R(R)MS newly initiating oral 
cladribine (cladribine cohort) to R(R)MS patients newly initiating fingolimod (comparator cohort). 
Study population: 
Patients with highly active R(R)MS newly started on oral cladribine or fingolimod according to 
local labels. 
Milestones: 
•  Protocol Version 1.0 approval (by PRAC) on 31 May 2018, Version 2.0 approved on 27 July 
2018 Version 3.0 approved on 18 February 2019 
•  Start of data collection - The start of data collection for the first country based on secondary use 
of data were in October 2017 and for primary use of data (Germany) on the 25 September 2018. 
End of data collection will be 15 years after start of data collection (Q3 2033). 
•  Final report -1 year at the latest after the end of data collection (Q3 2034). 
CLEAR (Pregnancy PASS) - Summary 
 Pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to oral cladribine: a multi-country 
cohort database study  
Study short name and title: 
CLEAR (Pregnancy PASS)  
Rationale and study objectives: 
A  multi-country,  cohort  database  study  to  investigate  whether  the  exposure  to  oral  cladribine 
before  or  during  pregnancy,  in  women  with  MS  treated  with  oral  cladribine  or  in  pregnancies 
fathered by MS patients treated with  cladribine, is  associated with  adverse pregnancy or infant 
outcomes.

Study design: 
Multi-country, cohort database study  
Study population: 
Female MS patients treated with oral cladribine before or during pregnancy and female partners 
of male MS patients treated with cladribine who father the pregnancy  
Milestones: 
•  Protocol approval (by PRAC) on 26 July 2018 
•  Start of data extraction for feasibility assessment counts to check sample size in each included 
database: 14 December 2020. 
•  Date for which the analytical data set is completely available: Q4 2027. Once the study has 
included 134 live births from pregnant women with MS exposed to oral cladribine and 268 live 
births from pregnant women with MS unexposed to any DMD for all databases combined or 5 
years after the first feasibility check in each of the databases if the targeted sample size cannot 
be reached, whichever occurs first. 
Final report of study results: submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) within one 
year of the last data analysis (anticipated in Q4 2028 at the latest), independently of the fact that 
the target sample size (134 live births in the cohort of pregnant women with MS exposed to oral 
cladribine  and  268  in  the  cohort  of  pregnant  women  with  MS  unexposed  to  any  DMD)  for  all 
databases combined will have been reached or not.

Additional Risk Minimization Measures  
Additional risk minimization: Mavenclad Prescriber Guide 
Objectives: 
The  Prescriber  Guide  provides  guidance  on  the  risk  management  of  cladribine  to  ensure  that 
prescribers, and their patients, are adequately informed on the treatment regimen, requirements for 
blood  cell  count  testing/monitoring,  liver  parameter  testing,  screening  for  latent  infections, 
monitoring of early signs and symptoms of infections and liver injury, management of infections 
and liver injury, precautions regarding pregnancy prevention (Annex 6). 
The Prescriber Guide addresses the following safety concerns:  
Important identified risks  
69/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RMP on Mavenclad® (Cladribine) Version No. 2.2, DLP 07 Jul 2023 
•  Severe (Grade ≥3) lymphopenia, to ensure compliance to hematological testing and treatment 
requirements;  
•  Herpes zoster, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms suggestive for this infection;  
•  Tuberculosis, to raise awareness about this risk;  
•  Liver injury, to ensure awareness of this risk and compliance to testing of liver parameters. 
Important potential risks  
•  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), opportunistic infections (other than PML 
and tuberculosis) and severe infections, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms suggestive 
of these risks;  
•  Malignancies, to raise awareness on this risk because:  
•  Patients with current active malignancies must not receive Mavenclad treatment;  
•  Patients should be advised to follow standard cancer screening;  
•  Teratogenicity/adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  to  ensure  that  female  patients  of  childbearing 
potential / partners of male patients receiving Mavenclad:  
•  Receive  counseling  before  starting  the  treatment  (consisting  of  two  treatment  courses 
administered at the beginning of two consecutive years) both in year 1 and 2;  
•  Use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose  
Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity 
The efficacy and safety of cladribine for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing 
multiple  sclerosis  has  been  demonstrated  in  clinical  trials.  In  clinical  practice  educating  the 
prescriber about the important risks and precautions for use of cladribine is important for achieving 
the best patient outcome. This is especially relevant given the dosing schedule of cladribine, with 
a  dosing  interval  of  1  year  between  start  of  treatment  courses,  as  this  could  impair  prescriber 
knowledge and retention of the key guidance and warnings for use. The Prescriber Guide is an 
important reference tool for prescribers providing guidance, in addition to the SmPC, on the risk 
management of cladribine in clinical practice.  
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
The target audience is all prescribers who are expected to prescribe Mavenclad.  
Prior  to  launch  of  Mavenclad  in  each  Member  State  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational 
materials, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the 
program, are agreed with each National Competent Authority (NCA).  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
Respective ICSRs will be reviewed to evaluate whether or not risk minimization measures as listed 
in the product labeling and educational material were adhered to.

for 
seizures

the 
in 
Criteria  for  success  are  generally  a  stable  reporting  rate/incidence  rate  of  the  respective  risk 
between  review  periods,  which  is  consistent  with  the  incidence  rate  of  the  respective  risk  as 
observed in clinical trials; in case of tuberculosis or PML: no cases or a low number; in case of 
malignancies: reporting rates consistent with background rates of a specific malignancy type in 
patients  with  MS);  in  case  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcome/teratogenicity:  low  exposure  to  oral 
cladribine  and  low  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes/teratogenicity  received  in  each 
periodic review and as collected in the Pregnancy PASS. 
Additional risk minimization: Mavenclad Patient Guide 
Objectives: 
The Patient Guide provides an introduction to Mavenclad treatment, its side effects, the important 
potential risks and information on pregnancy prevention. 
The Patient Guide addresses the following safety concerns:  
Important identified risks  
•  Severe (Grade ≥3) lymphopenia, to explain about the risk of lymphopenia and its impact on 
infections  
•  Herpes zoster, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms of this infection  
•  Tuberculosis, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms of this infection 
•  Liver  injury,  to  ensure  awareness  of  signs  and  symptoms  suggestive  of  this  risk  and  risk 
minimization measures 
Important potential risks  
•  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), opportunistic infections (other than PML 
and tuberculosis) and severe infections, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms suggestive 
of these risks;  
•  Malignancies, to explain what is known about the risk of cancer with cladribine and how the 
risk will be minimized through patient selection and cancer screening;  
•  Teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes, to explain what is known about the risk of birth 
defects/miscarriage and to highlight the need for effective contraception.

Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity 
The efficacy and safety of cladribine for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing 
multiple sclerosis has been demonstrated in clinical trials. In clinical practice educating the patient 
about the important risks and precautions for use of cladribine is important for maintaining the 
safety of the patient. The patient’s understanding of the risks is fundamental for identifying and 
reporting early signs and symptoms of the important risks to their healthcare professional to ensure 
timely treatment. This is especially relevant given the dosing schedule of cladribine that involves 
a dosing interval of 1 year between start of treatment courses, as the long time lag could impair 
patient knowledge and retention of the key guidance and warnings for use. The Patient Guide is 
an important reference tool for patients for providing guidance, in addition to the PL, on the safety 
and use of cladribine.  
Target audience and planned distribution path 
The target audience is all patients who are expected to use Mavenclad.  
Prior  to  launch  of  Mavenclad  in  each  Member  State  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational 
materials, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the 
program, are agreed with each NCA.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success:  
Respective ICSRs will be reviewed to evaluate whether or not risk minimization measures as listed 
in the product labeling and educational material were adhered to. 
Reporting  rate  of  the  respective  risk,  severity  and  complications  /  pregnancy  outcome  will  be 
periodically reviewed and comparison between periods will be reported in PBRERs. 
Incidence of the respective risk (i.e. AEs of special interest) and of the important potential risk of 
for 
seizures 
teratogenicity/adverse  pregnancy  outcomes  the  proportion  of  outcomes  of  cladribine  exposed 
pregnancies in the pregnancy PASS will be periodically reviewed and reported.  
long-term  PASS  will  be  periodically 
reviewed  and 
reported; 
the 
in 
Criteria  for  success  are  generally  a  stable  reporting  rate/incidence  rate  of  the  respective  risk 
between  review  periods,  which  is  consistent  with  the  incidence  rate  of  the  respective  risk  as 
observed in clinical trials; in case of tuberculosis or PML: no cases or a low number; in case of 
malignancies: reporting rates consistent with background rates of a specific malignancy type in 
patients  with  MS);  in  case  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcome/teratogenicity:  low  exposure  to  oral 
cladribine  and  low  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes/teratogenicity  received  in  each 
periodic review and as collected in the Pregnancy PASS.  
Removal of additional risk minimization activities 
Not applicable.

I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used for  
Mavenclad is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing multiple 
sclerosis  (MS)  as  defined  by  clinical  or  imaging  features.  It  contains  cladribine  as  the  active 
substance and it is taken orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Mavenclad’s benefits can be found in Mavenclad’s 
EPAR, including in  its plain-language summary,  available on the European Medicines  Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/mavenclad-epar-public-assessment-
report_en.pdf 
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize 
or Further Characterize the Risks  
Important risks of Mavenclad, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Mavenclad’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack chosen to ensure that the medicine 
is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  the  case  of  Mavenclad,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analyzed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment,  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine Pharmacovigilance 
Activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Mavenclad is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information  
Important  risks  of  Mavenclad  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
79/89 
 
 
 
RMP on Mavenclad® (Cladribine) Version No. 2.2, DLP 07 Jul 2023 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Mavenclad. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-
term use of the medicine);

Summary of Important Risks  
Important identified risk: Severe (Grade ≥3) lymphopenia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
The safety of cladribine was studied in all clinical trials that evaluated oral 
cladribine  monotherapy  3.5  mg/kg  (923  patients)  and  in  all  Phase  2  and 
Phase  3  studies  that  evaluated  oral,  intravenous  and  subcutaneous 
cladribine in different treatment regimens (1,976 patients).  
Severe  lymphopenia  is  considered  an  important  identified  risk  as  it  may 
increase the risk of infections, especially for herpes zoster, and needs to be 
managed  in  clinical  practice  through  lymphocyte  count  monitoring  before, 
during and after cladribine treatment. Data from clinical trials can provide an 
accurate  estimate  of  the  frequency  and  nature  of  severe  (Grade ≥3) 
lymphopenia that is expected to occur in clinical practice.  
Because of the dose-response observed in the clinical trials, doses higher 
than  3.5  mg/kg  of cladribine  appear  to  be  associated  with  a  higher  risk of 
severe  lymphopenia.  Higher  incidences  of  severe  lymphopenia  were  also 
seen in combination treatment with interferon (IFN) β. 
Routine risk minimization measures 
Lymphopenia is described as an adverse reaction (EU Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) section 4.8; Package Leaflet (PL) section 4) 
Monitoring  recommendations  are  provided  together  with  an  algorithm  for 
initiating and continuing treatment based on lymphocyte counts (EU SmPC

Phase  3  studies  that  evaluated  oral,  intravenous  and  subcutaneous 
cladribine in different treatment regimens (1,976 patients).  
Herpes  zoster  is  considered  an  important  identified  risk  as  the  pain 
associated with herpes zoster can be debilitating, particularly in the elderly. 
Data from clinical trials can provide an accurate estimate of the frequency 
and nature of herpes zoster that is expected to occur in clinical practice.

Important potential risk: Teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Cladribine  interferes  with  DNA  synthesis  and  could  cause  congenital 
malformations  when  used  during  pregnancy  based  on  human  experience 
with  other  substances  inhibiting  DNA  synthesis.  Non-clinical  studies  have 
also shown reproductive toxicity in the offspring of cladribine treated animals.  
Despite  precautionary  measures  to  prevent  pregnancy  in  clinical  trials, 
pregnancies  did  occur  during  cladribine  treatment  and  in  female  partners 
following  paternal  exposure  to  cladribine.  There  was  no  imbalance  in 
pregnancy  outcomes  between  cladribine-  and  placebo-treated  participants 
and there were no congenital malformations in pregnancies which occurred 
during cladribine treatment or within 6 months after last dose. 
Teratogenicity/adverse  pregnancy  outcomes  are  considered  an  important 
potential  risk  as  a  teratogenic  medicine  may  cause  growth  retardation, 
delayed  mental  development  or  other  congenital  disorders.  The  ongoing 
CLEAR study (pregnancy PASS) will provide data on pregnancies and infant 
outcomes in pregnant women with MS and in pregnancies fathered by men 
with MS exposed to oral cladribine treatment in routine clinical practice.

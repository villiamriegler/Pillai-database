Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Kerendia® (Finerenone)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kerendia®. The RMP details 
important risks of Kerendia®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Kerendia®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Kerendia®'s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kerendia® should be 
used.
This summary of the RMP for Kerendia® should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Kerendia®’s RMP.
The medicine and what it is used for
Kerendia® is authorised for “the treatment of chronic kidney disease (with albuminuria) 
associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. For study results with respect to renal and 
cardiovascular events, see section 5.1”. It contains finerenone as the active substance and it is 
given by oral administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Kerendia®’s benefits can be found in Kerendia®’s 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), including in its plain-language summary, 
available on the EMA website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kerendia
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Kerendia®, together with measures to minimise such risks, are outlined 
below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kerendia® is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Kerendia® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kerendia®. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks
Important identified risk – Hyperkalemia
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
The evidence is based on two pivotal Phase III studies FIDELIO-
DKD (#16244) and FIGARO-DKD (#17530) conducted in patients 
with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.
Risk factors and risk groups
Hyperkalemia is a known complication of reduced renal function in 
patients with CKD. Besides CKD, the most common risk factors for 
hyperkalemia include cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and 
concomitant use of drugs which raise the potassium concentration 
(e.g., ACEIs, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, and beta-
blockers).
Based on the analyses of two pivotal Phase III studies FIDELIO-
DKD and FIGARO-DKD, risk factors for hyperkalemia include low 
eGFR, higher baseline serum potassium and previous episodes of 
hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of finerenone with CYP3A4 
inhibitors may be associated with a higher risk of developing 
hyperkalemia due to an increase in finerenone exposure.

Important potential risk – Embryo-foetal toxicity
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
The evidence is based on non-clinical data in the developmental 
toxicity studies in the rat as well as literature data of other MRAs. 
There are no clinical data on the use of finerenone in pregnant 
women.

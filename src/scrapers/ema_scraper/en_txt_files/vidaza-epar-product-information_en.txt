CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vidaza is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) with: 
• 
intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International 
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29% marrow blasts without 
myeloproliferative disorder,

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Vidaza treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced 
in the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients should be premedicated with anti-emetics for nausea 
and vomiting. 
UPosology 
The recommended starting dose for the first treatment cycle, for all patients regardless of baseline 
haematology laboratory values, is 75 mg/mP
7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle). 
P of body surface area, injected subcutaneously, daily for 
2
It is recommended that patients be treated for a minimum of 6 cycles. Treatment should be continued 
for as long as the patient continues to benefit or until disease progression. 
Patients should be monitored for haematologic response/toxicity and renal toxicities (see section 4.4); 
a delay in starting the next cycle or a dose reduction as described below may be necessary. 
Vidaza should not be used interchangeably with oral azacitidine. Due to differences in the exposure, 
the dose and schedule recommendations for oral azacitidine are different from those for injectable 
azacitidine. Healthcare professionals are recommended to verify the name of the medicinal product, 
dose and administration route.

ULaboratory tests 
Liver function tests, serum creatinine and serum bicarbonate should be determined prior to initiation 
of therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to 
initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each 
treatment cycle. 
Dose adjustment due to haematological toxicity 
Haematological toxicity is defined as the lowest count reached (nadir) in a given cycle if platelets 
≤ 50.0 x 10P
9
9
P/L and/or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1 x 10P
P/L. 
Recovery is defined as an increase of cell line(s) where haematological toxicity was observed of at 
least half of the absolute difference of nadir and the baseline count plus the nadir count (i.e. blood 
count at recovery ≥ nadir count + (0.5 x [|baseline count – nadir count|]). 
Patients without reduced baseline blood counts (i.e. White Blood Cells (WBC) ≥ 3.0 x 10P

9
ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10P
P/l, and platelets ≥ 75.0 x 10P
If haematological toxicity is observed following Vidaza treatment, the next cycle of the therapy should 
be delayed until the platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 
14 days, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, 
the dose should be reduced according to the following table. Following dose modifications, the cycle 
duration should return to 28 days.

Following Vidaza treatment, if the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets from that prior to treatment 
is ≤ 50%, or greater than 50% but with an improvement in any cell line differentiation, the next cycle 
should not be delayed and no dose adjustment made. 
9
P/L or platelets 
If the decrease in WBC or ANC or platelets is greater than 50% from that prior to treatment, with no 
improvement in cell line differentiation, the next cycle of Vidaza therapy should be delayed until the 
platelet count and the ANC have recovered. If recovery is achieved within 14 days, no dose 
adjustment is necessary. However, if recovery has not been achieved within 14 days, bone marrow 
cellularity should be determined. If the bone marrow cellularity is > 50%, no dose adjustments should 
be made. If bone marrow cellularity is ≤ 50%, treatment should be delayed and the dose reduced 
according to the following table: 
Bone marrow cellularity

USpecial populations 
Elderly patients 
No specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly. Because elderly patients are more 
likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Patients with renal impairment 
Azacitidine can be administered to patients with renal impairment without initial dose adjustment (see 
section 5.2). If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to less than 20 mmol/L occur, the 
dose should be reduced by 50% on the next cycle. If unexplained elevations in serum creatinine or 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above upper limit of normal (ULN) 
occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and the dose should 
be reduced by 50% on the next treatment cycle (see section 4.4). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). Patients 
with severe hepatic organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse events. No specific 
modification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment prior to starting 
treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology laboratory values. Vidaza 
is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Vidaza in children aged 0-17 years have not yet been established. Currently 
available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
UMethod of administration 
Reconstituted Vidaza should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Injection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site 
and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened. 
After reconstitution, the suspension should not be filtered. For instructions on reconstitution of the 
medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
UHaematological toxicity 
Treatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly 
during the first 2 cycles (see section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be performed as needed to 
monitor response and toxicity, but at least prior to each treatment cycle. After administration of the 
recommended dose for the first cycle, the dose for subsequent cycles should be reduced or its 
administration delayed based on nadir counts and haematological response (see section 4.2). Patients 
should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. Patients and physicians are also advised to be 
observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding. 
UHepatic impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with extensive 
tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience progressive hepatic coma 
and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in such patients with baseline serum albumin 
< 30 g/L. Azacitidine is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see 
section 4.3). 
URenal impairment 
Renal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported in 
patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. In 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition, renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to < 20 mmol/L in association 
with an alkaline urine and hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3 mmol/L) developed in 5 subjects with 
chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) treated with azacitidine and etoposide. If unexplained 
reductions in serum bicarbonate (< 20 mmol/L) or elevations of serum creatinine or BUN occur, the 
dose should be reduced or administration delayed (see section 4.2). 
Patients should be advised to report oliguria and anuria to the health care provider immediately. 
Although no clinically relevant differences in the frequency of adverse reactions were noted between 
subjects with normal renal function compared to those with renal impairment, patients with renal 
impairment should be closely monitored for toxicity since azacitidine and/or its metabolites are 
primarily excreted by the kidney (see section 4.2). 
ULaboratory tests 
Liver function tests, serum creatinine and serum bicarbonate should be determined prior to initiation 
of therapy and prior to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to 
initiation of therapy and as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each 
treatment cycle, see also section 4.8. 
UCardiac and pulmonary disease 
Patients with a history of severe congestive heart failure, clinically unstable cardiac disease or 
pulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal registration studies (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 and 
AZA-AML-001) and therefore the safety and efficacy of azacitidine in these patients has not been 
established. Recent data from a clinical study in patients with a known history of cardiovascular or 
pulmonary disease showed a significantly increased incidence of cardiac events with azacitidine (see 
section 4.8). It is therefore advised to exercise caution when prescribing azacitidine to these patients. 
Cardiopulmonary assessment before and during the treatment should be considered. 
UNecrotising fasciitis 
Necrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients treated with Vidaza. Vidaza 
therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis and appropriate treatment 
should be promptly initiated. 
UTumour lysis syndrome 
The patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment. 
These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 
UDifferentiation syndrome 
Cases of differentiation syndrome (also known as retinoic acid syndrome) have been reported in 
patients receiving injectable azacitidine. Differentiation syndrome may be fatal and symptoms and 
clinical findings include respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, fever, rash, pulmonary oedema, 
peripheral oedema, rapid weight gain, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, hypotension and renal 
dysfunction (see section 4.8). Treatment with high-dose IV corticosteroids and haemodynamic 
monitoring should be considered at first onset of symptoms or signs suggestive of differentiation 
syndrome. Temporary discontinuation of injectable azacitidine should be considered until resolution of 
symptoms and if resumed, caution is advised. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and 
glutathione transferases (GSTs); interactions related to these metabolizing enzymes in vivo are 
therefore considered unlikely. 
Clinically significant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on cytochrome P450 enzymes are 
unlikely (see section 5.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
UWomen of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months 
after treatment. Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and must use 
effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after treatment. 
UPregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Studies in mice have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Based on 
results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine should not be used during 
pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary. The advantages of treatment 
should be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case. 
UBreast-feeding 
It is unknown whether azacitidine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential serious 
adverse reactions in the nursing child, breast-feeding is contraindicated during azacitidine therapy. 
UFertility 
There are no human data on the effect of azacitidine on fertility. In animals, adverse reactions with 
azacitidine use on male fertility have been documented (see section 5.3). Before starting treatment, 
male patients should be advised to seek counselling on sperm storage. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Azacitidine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has 
been reported with the use of azacitidine. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or 
operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
USummary of the safety profile 
Adult population with MDS, CMML and AML (20-30% marrow blasts) 
Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of Vidaza have 
occurred in 97% of patients. 
The most common serious adverse reactions noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) 
included febrile neutropenia (8.0%) and anaemia (2.3%), which were also reported in the supporting 
studies (CALGB 9221 and CALGB 8921). Other serious adverse reactions from these 3 studies 
included infections such as neutropenic sepsis (0.8%) and pneumonia (2.5%) (some with fatal 
outcome), thrombocytopenia (3.5%), hypersensitivity reactions (0.25%) and haemorrhagic events (e.g. 
cerebral haemorrhage [0.5%], gastrointestinal haemorrhage [0.8%] and intracranial haemorrhage 
[0.5%]). 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were haematological 
reactions (71.4%) including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia (usually Grade 3-4), 
gastrointestinal events (60.6%) including nausea, vomiting (usually Grade 1-2) or injection site 
reactions (77.1%; usually Grade 1-2). 
Adult population aged 65 years or older with AML with > 30% marrow blasts 
The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 10%) noted from AZA-AML-001 within the 
azacitidine treatment arm included febrile neutropenia (25.0%), pneumonia (20.3%), and pyrexia 
(10.6%). Other less frequently reported serious adverse reactions in the azacitidine treatment arm 
included sepsis (5.1%), anaemia (4.2%), neutropenic sepsis (3.0%), urinary tract infection (3.0%), 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thrombocytopenia (2.5%), neutropenia (2.1%), cellulitis (2.1%), dizziness (2.1%) and 
dyspnoea (2.1%). 
The most commonly reported (≥ 30%) adverse reactions with azacitidine treatment were 
gastrointestinal events, including constipation (41.9%), nausea (39.8%), and diarrhoea (36.9%; usually 
Grade 1-2), general disorders and administration site conditions including pyrexia (37.7%; usually 
Grade 1-2) and haematological events, including febrile neutropenia (32.2%) and neutropenia (30.1%; 
usually Grade 3-4). 
UTabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 below contains adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment obtained from the main 
clinical studies in MDS and AML and post marketing surveillance. 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions are presented in the table below according to the 
highest frequency observed in any of the main clinical studies.

UDescription of selected adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions 
The most commonly reported (≥ 10%) haematological adverse reactions associated with azacitidine 
treatment include anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and leukopenia, and 
were usually Grade 3 or 4. There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles, 
after which they occur with less frequency in patients with restoration of haematological function. 
Most haematological adverse reactions were managed by routine monitoring of complete blood counts 
and delaying azacitidine administration in the next cycle, prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor 
support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia and transfusions for anaemia or thrombocytopenia as required. 
Infections 
Myelosuppression may lead to neutropenia and an increased risk of infection. Serious adverse 
reactions such as sepsis, including neutropenic sepsis, and pneumonia were reported in patients 
receiving azacitidine, some with a fatal outcome. Infections may be managed with the use of anti-
infectives plus growth factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia. 
Bleeding 
Bleeding may occur with patients receiving azacitidine. Serious adverse reactions such as 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage have been reported. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding, particularly those with pre-existing or treatment-
related thrombocytopenia. 
Hypersensitivity 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving azacitidine. In case of an 
anaphylactic-like reaction, treatment with azacitidine should be immediately discontinued and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment initiated. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue adverse reactions 
The majority of skin and subcutaneous adverse reactions were associated with the injection site. None 
of these adverse reactions led to discontinuation of azacitidine, or reduction of azacitidine dose in the 
pivotal studies. The majority of adverse reactions occurred during the first 2 cycles of treatment and 
tended to decrease with subsequent cycles. Subcutaneous adverse reactions such as injection site 
rash/inflammation/pruritus, rash, erythema and skin lesion may require management with concomitant 
medicinal products, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicinal products (NSAIDs). These cutaneous reactions have to be distinguished from soft tissue 
infections, sometimes occurring at injection site. Soft tissue infections, including cellulitis and 
necrotising fasciitis in rare cases leading to death, have been reported with azacitidine in the post 
marketing setting. For clinical management of infectious adverse reactions, see section 4.8 Infections. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
The most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment 
included constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. These adverse reactions were managed 
symptomatically with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting, anti-diarrhoeals for diarrhoea and 
laxatives and/or stool softeners for constipation. 
Renal adverse reactions 
Renal abnormalities, ranging from elevated serum creatinine and haematuria to renal tubular acidosis, 
renal failure and death were reported in patients treated with azacitidine (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic adverse reactions 
Patients with extensive tumour burden due to metastatic disease have been reported to experience 
hepatic failure, progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment (see section 4.4). 
Cardiac events 
Data from a clinical study allowing enrolment of patients with known history of cardiovascular or 
pulmonary disease showed an increase in cardiac events in patients with newly diagnosed AML 
treated with azacitidine (see section 4.4). 
Elderly population 
There is limited safety information available with azacitidine in patients ≥ 85 years (with 14 [5.9%] 
patients ≥ 85 years treated in Study AZA-AML-001). 
Paediatric population 
In Study AZA-JMML-001, 28 paediatric patients (1 month to less than 18 years of age) were treated 
with Vidaza for MDS (n = 10) or juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) (n = 18) (see 
section 5.1). 
All 28 patients experienced at least 1 adverse event and 17 (60.7%) experienced at least 1 treatment-
related event. The most commonly reported adverse events in the overall paediatric population were 
pyrexia, haematologic events including anaemia, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia, and 
gastrointestinal events including constipation and vomiting. 
Three (3) subjects experienced a treatment emergent event leading to drug discontinuation (pyrexia, 
disease progression and abdominal pain). 
In Study AZA-AML-004, 7 paediatric patients (aged 2 to 12 years) were treated with Vidaza for AML 
in molecular relapse after first complete remission [CR1] (see section 5.1). 
All 7 patients experienced at least 1 treatment-related adverse event. The most commonly reported 
adverse events were neutropenia, nausea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea and increased 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Two patients experienced a treatment-related event leading to dose 
interruption (febrile neutropenia, neutropenia). 
No new safety signals were identified in the limited number of paediatric patients treated with Vidaza 
during the course of the clinical study. The overall safety profile was consistent with that of the adult 
population. 
UReporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in 37TUAppendix VU37T. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
One case of overdose with azacitidine was reported during clinical studies. A patient experienced 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 
2
290 mg/mP
P, almost 4 times the recommended starting dose. 
In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and should 
receive supportive treatment, as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for 
azacitidine overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, pyrimidine analogues; ATC code: L01BC07 
Mechanism of action 
Azacitidine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by multiple mechanisms including 
cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA. The 
cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA, 
RNA and protein synthesis, incorporation into RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage 
pathways. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. Incorporation of azacitidine 
into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation of DNA. 
DNA hypomethylation of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation, 
differentiation and death pathways may result in gene re-expression and restoration of cancer-
suppressing functions to cancer cells. The relative importance of DNA hypomethylation versus 
cytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been established. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adult population (MDS, CMML and AML [20-30% marrow blasts]) 
The efficacy and safety of Vidaza were studied in an international, multicentre, controlled, open-label, 
randomised, parallel-group, Phase 3 comparative study (AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001) in adult patients 
with: intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System 
(IPSS), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts in 
transformation (RAEB-T) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mCMML) according to 
the French American British (FAB) classification system. RAEB-T patients (21-30% blasts) are now 
considered to be AML patients under the current WHO classification system. Azacitidine plus best 
supportive care (BSC) (n = 179) was compared to conventional care regimens (CCR). CCR consisted 
of BSC alone (n = 105), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 49) or standard induction chemotherapy 
plus BSC (n = 25). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCR prior to 
randomisation. Patients received this pre-selected regimen if not randomised to Vidaza. As part of the 
inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 0-2. Patients with secondary MDS were excluded from the study. The primary 
endpoint of the study was overall survival. Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous dose of 
2
P daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median 
75 mg/mP
of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 cycles. Within the Intent to Treat population (ITT), the 
median age was 69 years (range 38 to 88 years). 
In the ITT analysis of 358 patients (179 azacitidine and 179 CCR), Vidaza treatment was associated 
with a median survival of 24.46 months versus 15.02 months for those receiving CCR treatment, a 
difference of 9.4 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001. The hazard ratio (HR) for the 
treatment effect was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.77). The two-year survival rates were 50.8% in patients 
receiving azacitidine versus 26.2% in patients receiving CCR (p < 0.0001).

The survival benefits of Vidaza were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option (BSC alone, 
low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC) utilised in the 
control arm. 
When IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed, similar findings in terms of median overall survival 
were observed in all groups (good, intermediate, poor cytogenetics, including monosomy 7). 
On analyses of age subgroups, an increase in median overall survival was observed for all groups 
(< 65 years, ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years). 
Vidaza treatment was associated with a median time to death or transformation to AML of 
13.0 months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment, an improvement of 5.4 months 
with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025. 
Vidaza treatment was also associated with a reduction in cytopenias, and their related symptoms. 
Vidaza treatment led to a reduced need for red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions. Of the 
patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0% of these 
patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4% of 
the patients in the combined CCR groups (a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) difference of 33.6% 
(95% CI: 22.4, 44.6). In patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and became 
independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the 
azacitidine group. 
Response was assessed by the investigator or by the Independent Review Committee (IRC). Overall 
response (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) as determined by the investigator was 
29% in the azacitidine group and 12% in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0001). Overall response 
(CR + PR) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7% (12/179) in the azacitidine 
group compared with 1% (2/179) in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0113). The differences between 
the IRC and investigator assessments of response were a consequence of the International Working 
Group (IWG) criteria requiring improvement in peripheral blood counts and maintenance of these 
improvements for a minimum of 56 days. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that 
had not achieved a complete/partial response following azacitidine treatment. Haematological 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement (major or minor) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49% of patients receiving 
azacitidine compared with 29% of patients treated with combined CCR (p < 0.0001). 
In patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, the percentage of patients with a 
major cytogenetic response was similar in the azacitidine and combined CCR groups. Minor 
cytogenetic response was statistically significantly (p = 0.0015) higher in the azacitidine group (34%) 
compared with the combined CCR group (10%). 
Adult population aged 65 years or older with AML with > 30% marrow blasts 
The results presented below represent the intent-to-treat population studied in AZA-AML-001 (see 
section 4.1 for the approved indication). 
The efficacy and safety of Vidaza was studied in an international, multicentre, controlled, open-label, 
parallel group Phase 3 study in patients 65 years and older with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary 
AML with > 30% bone marrow blasts according to the WHO classification, who were not eligible for 
HSCT. Vidaza plus BSC (n = 241) was compared to CCR. CCR consisted of BSC alone (n = 45), 
low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 158), or standard intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine and 
anthracycline plus BSC (n = 44). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCRs prior 
to randomization. Patients received the pre-selected regimen if not randomised to Vidaza. As part of 
the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and 
intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The primary endpoint of the study was 
overall survival. 
Vidaza was administered at a SC dose of 75mg/mP
21 days (28 day treatment cycle), for a median of 6 cycles (range: 1 to 28), BSC-only patients for a 
median of 3 cycles (range: 1 to 20), low-dose cytarabine patients for a median of 4 cycles (range 1 to 
25) and standard intensive chemotherapy patients for a median of 2 cycles (range: 1 to 3, induction 
cycle plus 1 or 2 consolidation cycles). 
2
P/day for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 
The individual baseline parameters were comparable between the Vidaza and CCR groups. The 
median age of the subjects was 75.0 years (range: 64 to 91 years), 75.2% were Caucasian and 59.0% 
were male. At baseline 60.7% were classified as AML not otherwise specified, 32.4% AML with 
myelodysplasia-related changes, 4.1% therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and 2.9% AML with 
recurrent genetic abnormalities according to the WHO classification. 
In the ITT analysis of 488 patients (241 Vidaza and 247 CCR), Vidaza treatment was associated with a 
median survival of 10.4 months versus 6.5 months for those receiving CCR treatment, a difference of 
3.8 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.1009 (two-sided). The hazard ratio for the treatment 
effect was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.69, 1.03). The one-year survival rates were 46.5% in patients receiving 
Vidaza versus 34.3% in patients receiving CCR.

The Cox PH model adjusted for pre-specified baseline prognostic factors defined a HR for Vidaza 
versus CCR of 0.80 (95% CI = 0.66, 0.99; p = 0.0355). 
In addition, although the study was not powered to demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
when comparing azacitidine to the preselection CCR treatment groups, the survival of Vidaza treated 
patients was longer when compared to CCR treatment options BSC alone, low-dose cytarabine plus 
BSC and were similar when compared to standard intensive chemotherapy plus BSC. 
In all pre-specified subgroups (age [< 75 years and ≥ 75 years], gender, race, ECOG performance 
status [0 or 1 and 2], baseline cytogenetic risk [intermediate and poor], geographic region, WHO 
classification of AML [including AML with myelodysplasia-related changes], baseline WBC count 
P/L], baseline bone marrow blasts [≤ 50% and > 50%] and prior history of 
[≤ 5 x10P
MDS), there was a trend in OS benefit in favour of Vidaza. In a few pre-specified subgroups, the OS 
HR reached statistical significance including patients with poor cytogenetic risk, patients with AML 
with myelodysplasia-related changes, patients < 75 years, female patients and white patients.

Haematologic and cytogenetic responses were assessed by the investigator and by the IRC with similar 
results. Overall response rate (complete remission [CR] + complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery [CRi]) as determined by the IRC was 27.8% in the Vidaza group and 25.1% in the 
combined CCR group (p = 0.5384). In patients who achieved CR or CRi, the median duration of 
remission was 10.4 months (95% CI = 7.2, 15.2) for the Vidaza subjects and 12.3 months 
(95% CI = 9.0, 17.0) for the CCR subjects. A survival benefit was also demonstrated in patients that 
had not achieved a complete response for Vidaza compared to CCR. 
Vidaza treatment improved peripheral blood counts and led to a reduced need for RBC and platelet 
transfusions. A patient was considered RBC or platelet transfusion dependent at baseline if the subject 
had one or more RBC or platelet transfusions during the 56 days (8 weeks) on or prior to 
randomization, respectively. A patient was considered RBC or platelet transfusion independent during 
the treatment period if the subject had no RBC or platelet transfusions during any consecutive 56 days 
during the reporting period, respectively. 
Of the patients in the Vidaza group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 38.5% 
(95% CI = 31.1, 46.2) of these patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment 
period, compared with 27.6% of (95% CI = 20.9, 35.1) patients in the combined CCR groups. In 
patients who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline and achieved transfusion independence on 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.9 months in the Vidaza group 
and was not reached in the CCR group. 
Of the patients in the Vidaza group who were platelet transfusion dependent at baseline, 40.6% 
(95% CI = 30.9, 50.8) of these patients became platelet transfusion independent during the treatment 
period, compared with 29.3% of (95% CI = 19.7, 40.4) patients in the combined CCR groups. In 
patients who were platelet transfusion dependent at baseline and achieved transfusion independence on 
treatment, the median duration of platelet transfusion independence was 10.8 months in the Vidaza 
group and 19.2 months in the CCR group. 
Health- Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed using the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). HRQoL data could 
be analysed for a subset of the full study population. While there are limitations in the analysis, the 
available data suggest that patients do not experience meaningful deterioration in quality of life during 
treatment with Vidaza. 
Paediatric population 
Study AZA-JMML-001 was a Phase 2, international, multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and activity of Vidaza prior to HSCT in paediatric 
patients with newly diagnosed advanced MDS or JMML. The primary objective of the clinical study 
was to evaluate the effect of Vidaza on response rate at Cycle 3, Day 28. 
Patients (MDS, n = 10; JMML, n = 18, 3 months to 15 years; 71% male) were treated with intravenous 
Vidaza 75 mg/m², daily on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 3 cycles and a maximum 
of 6 cycles. 
Enrolment in the MDS study arm was stopped after 10 MDS patients due to a lack of efficacy: no 
confirmed responses were recorded in these 10 patients. 
In the JMML study arm, 18 patients (13 PTPN11, 3 NRAS, 1 KRAS somatic mutations and 1 clinical 
diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF-1]) were enrolled. Sixteen patients completed 3 cycles of 
therapy and 5 of them completed 6 cycles. A total of 11 JMML patients had a clinical response at 
Cycle 3, Day 28, of these 11 subjects, 9 (50%) subjects had a confirmed clinical response (3 subjects 
with cCR and 6 subjects with cPR). Among the cohort of JMML patients treated with Vidaza, 7 
9
P/L) and 7 (43.8%) patients 
(43.8%) patients had a sustained platelet response (counts ≥ 100 × 10 P
required transfusions at HSCT. 17 of 18 patients proceeded to HSCT. 
Because of the study design (small patient numbers and various confounding factors), it cannot be 
concluded from this clinical study whether Vidaza prior to HSCT improves survival outcome in 
JMML patients. 
Study AZA-AML-004 was a Phase 2, multicentre, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
pharmacodynamics and efficacy of Vidaza compared to no anti-cancer treatment in children and 
young adults with AML in molecular relapse after CR1. 
Seven patients (median age 6.7 years [range 2 to 12 years]; 71.4% male) were treated with intravenous 
Vidaza 100 mg/mP
P, daily on Days 1 to 7 of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 3 cycles. 
2
Five patients had minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at Day 84 with 4 patients achieving 
either molecular stabilization (n = 3) or molecular improvement (n = 1) and 1 patient had clinical 
relapse. Six of 7 patients (90% [95% CI = 0.4, 1.0]) treated with azacitidine underwent HSCT. 
Due to the small sample size, the efficacy of Vidaza in paediatric AML cannot be established.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration of a single 75 mg/mP
with peak plasma concentrations of 750 ± 403 ng/mL occurring at 0.5 h after dosing (the first 
sampling point). The absolute bioavailability of azacitidine after subcutaneous relative to intravenous 
administration (single 75 mg/mP
(AUC). 
P doses) was approximately 89% based on the area under the curve 
P dose, azacitidine was rapidly absorbed 
2
2
Area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration (CRmaxR) of subcutaneous admiminstration of 
azacitidine were approximately proportional within the 25 to 100 mg/mP
2 
Pdose range. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, the mean volume of distribution was 76 ± 26 L, and systemic 
clearance was 147 ± 47 L/h. 
Biotransformation 
Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and 
glutathione transferases (GSTs). 
Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. In 
human liver S9 fractions, formation of metabolites was independent of NADPH implying that 
azacitidine metabolism was not mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. An in vitro study of 
azacitidine with cultured human hepatocytes indicates that at concentrations of 1.0 µM to 100 µM (i.e. 
up to approximately 30-fold higher than clinically achievable concentrations), azacitidine does not 
induce CYP 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4 or 3A5. In studies to assess inhibition of a series of P450 isoenzymes 
(CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) azacitidine up to 100 μM did not produce 
inhibition. Therefore, CYP enzyme induction or inhibition by azacitidine at clinically achievable 
plasma concentrations is unlikely. 
Elimination 
Azacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (tR½R) after subcutaneous 
administration of 41 ± 8 minutes. No accumulation occurs after subcutaneous administration of 
75 mg/mP
azacitidine and/or its metabolites. Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 
14
2
P azacitidine once daily for 7 days. Urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of 
PC-azacitidine, 85 and 50% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine respectively, 
P
while < 1% was recovered in faeces. 
Special populations 
The effects of hepatic impairment (see section 4.2), gender, age, or race on the pharmacokinetics of 
azacitidine have not been formally studied. 
Paediatric population 
In Study AZA-JMML-001, pharmacokinetic analysis was determined from 10 MDS and 18 JMML 
paediatric patients on Day 7 of Cycle 1 (see section 5.1). The median age (range) of the MDS patients 
was 13.3 (1.9-15) years and 2.1 (0.2-6.9) years for JMML patients. 
2
P dose, Vidaza rapidly reached CRmaxR within 
Following intravenous administration of a 75 mg/mP
0.083 hours in both MDS and JMML populations. The geometric mean CRmaxR were 1797.5 and 
1066.3 ng/mL, and the geometric mean AUCR0-∞R were 606.9 and 240.2 ng h/mL, for MDS and JMML 
patients, respectively. The geometric mean volume of distribution in MDS and JMML subjects were 
103.9 and 61.1 L, respectively. It appeared that the total plasma exposure of Vidaza was higher in 
MDS subjects; however, moderate to high between-patient variability was noted for both AUC and 
CRmaxR. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The geometric mean tR½R were 0.4 and 0.3 hours, and the geometric mean clearances were 166.4 and 
148.3 L/h for MDS and JMML, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study AZA-JMML-001 were pooled together and compared to 
pharmacokinetic data from 6 adult subjects with MDS administered 75 mg/mP
Study AZA-2002-BA-002. Mean CRmaxR and AUCR0-tR of Vidaza were similar between adult patients and 
paediatric patients after intravenous administration (2750 ng/mL versus 2841 ng/mL and 
1025 ng∙h/mL versus 882.1 ng h/mL, respectively). 
2
P Vidaza intravenously in 
In Study AZA-AML-004, pharmacokinetic analysis was determined from 6 of the 7 paediatric 
patients, which had at least one measurable postdose pharmacokinetic concentration (see section 5.1). 
The median age (range) of the AML patients was 6.7 (2-12) years. 
2
P, the geometric means for CRmaxR and AUCR0-tauR on Cycle 1 Day 7 
Following multiple doses of 100 mg/mP
were 1557 ng/mL and 899.6 ng∙h/mL, respectively, with high inter-subject variability (CV% of 
201.6% and 87.8%, respectively) observed. Azacitidine rapidly reached CRmaxR, with a median time of 
0.090 hours post-intravenous administration and declined with a geometric mean tR1/2R of 0.380 hours. 
The geometric means for clearance and volume of distribution were 127.2 L/h and 70.2 L, 
respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic (azacitidine) exposure observed in children with AML at molecular relapse after CR1 
was comparable to exposure from pooled data of 10 children with MDS and 18 children with JMML 
and also comparable to azacitidine exposure in adults with MDS. 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment has no major effect on the pharmacokinetic exposure of azacitidine after single and 
multiple subcutaneous administrations. Following subcutaneous administration of a single 75 mg/mP
P 
dose, mean exposure values (AUC and CRmaxR) from subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment were increased by 11-21%, 15-27%, and 41-66%, respectively, compared to normal renal 
function subjects. However, exposure was within the same general range of exposures observed for 
subjects with normal renal function. Azacitidine can be administered to patients with renal impairment 
without initial dose adjustment provided these patients are monitored for toxicity since azacitidine 
and/or its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney. 
2
Pharmacogenomics 
The effect of known cytidine deaminase polymorphisms on azacitidine metabolism has not been 
formally investigated. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Azacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian 
cell systems in vitro. The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. 
Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when administered 
intraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumours in the 
lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine 
administered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats revealed an increased 
incidence of testicular tumours. 
Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death 
(increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis. 
Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before 
closure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse reactions when given pre-
implantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic when given during organogenesis. Foetal abnormalities 
during organogenesis in rats included: CNS anomalies (exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies 
(micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (microphthalmia, micrognathia, 
gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in 
decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. 
Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm 
counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in 
mated females (see section 4.6).

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Recommendations for safe handling 
Vidaza is a cytotoxic medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution 
should be exercised when handling and preparing azacitidine suspensions. Procedures for proper 
handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be applied. 
If reconstituted azacitidine comes into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with 
soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. 
Reconstitution procedure 
Vidaza should be reconstituted with water for injections. The shelf life of the reconstituted medicinal 
product can be extended by reconstituting with refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for injections. Details 
on storage of the reconstituted product are provided below. 
1.

6. 
The following supplies should be assembled: 
Vial (s) of azacitidine; vial(s) of water for injections; non-sterile surgical gloves; alcohol wipes; 
5 mL injection syringe(s) with needle(s). 
4 mL of water for injections should be drawn into the syringe, making sure to purge any air 
trapped within the syringe. 
The needle of the syringe containing the 4 mL of water for injections should be inserted through 
the rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into 
the vial. 
Following removal of the syringe and needle, the vial should be vigorously shaken until a 
uniform cloudy suspension is achieved. After reconstitution each mL of suspension will contain 
25 mg of azacitidine (100 mg/4 mL). The reconstituted product is a homogeneous, cloudy 
suspension, free of agglomerates. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles 
or agglomerates. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution since this could remove the 
active substance. It must be taken into account that filters are present in some adaptors, spikes 
and closed systems; therefore such systems should not be used for administration of the 
medicinal product after reconstitution. 
The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted into the vial. The vial 
should then be turned upside down, making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid. 
The plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required 
for the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe. The syringe with 
needle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of. 
A fresh subcutaneous needle (recommended 25-gauge) should then be firmly attached to the 
syringe. The needle should not be purged prior to injection, in order to reduce the incidence of 
local injection site reactions. 
7.  When more than 1 vial is needed all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be

repeated. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, the dose should be equally divided e.g., dose 
150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it 
may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. 
The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. 
The syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to 
administration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 °C-25 °C. If the elapsed time is 
longer than 30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose 
prepared. To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy 
suspension is achieved. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or 
agglomerates. 
Storage of the reconstituted product 
For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Vidaza is and what it is used for 
What Vidaza is 
Vidaza is an anti-cancer agent which belongs to a group of medicines called ‘anti-metabolites’. Vidaza 
contains the active substance ‘azacitidine’. 
What Vidaza is used for 
Vidaza is used in adults who are not able to have a stem cell transplantation to treat: 
• 
• 
• 
higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 
These are diseases which affect the bone marrow and can cause problems with normal blood cell 
production. 
How Vidaza works 
Vidaza works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine becomes incorporated into the 
genetic material of cells (ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). It is thought to 
work by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of 
new RNA and DNA. These actions are thought to correct problems with the maturation and growth of 
young blood cells in the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells 
in leukaemia. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Vidaza works or why this medicine 
has been prescribed for you. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Vidaza 
Do not use Vidaza 
• 
if you are allergic to azacitidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have advanced liver cancer. 
if you are breast-feeding. 
•

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Vidaza: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have decreased counts of platelets, red or white blood cells. 
if you have kidney disease. 
if you have liver disease. 
if you have ever had a heart condition or heart attack or any history of lung disease. 
Vidaza can cause a serious immune reaction called ‘differentiation syndrome’ (see section 4). 
Blood test 
You will have blood tests before you begin treatment with Vidaza and at the start of each period of 
treatment (called a ‘cycle’). This is to check that you have enough blood cells and that your liver and 
kidneys are working properly. 
Children and adolescents 
Vidaza is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18. 
Other medicines and Vidaza 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
This is because Vidaza may affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines 
may affect the way Vidaza works. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
You should not use Vidaza during pregnancy as it may be harmful to the baby. 
If you are a woman who can become pregnant you should use an effective method of contraception 
while taking Vidaza and for 6 months after stopping treatment with Vidaza. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you become pregnant during treatment. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed when using Vidaza. It is not known if this medicine passes into 
human milk. 
Fertility 
Men should not father a child while receiving treatment with Vidaza. Men should use an effective 
method of contraception while taking Vidaza and for 3 months after stopping treatment with Vidaza.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Recommendations for safe handling 
Vidaza is a cytotoxic medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution 
should be exercised when handling and preparing azacitidine suspensions. Procedures for proper 
handling and disposal of anticancer medicinal products should be applied. 
If reconstituted azacitidine comes into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with 
soap and water. If it comes into contact with mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. 
Incompatibilities 
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned 
below (see “Reconstitution Procedure”). 
Reconstitution procedure 
Vidaza should be reconstituted with water for injections. The shelf life of the reconstituted medicinal 
product can be extended by reconstituting with refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for injections. Details 
on storage of the reconstituted product are provided below. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
The following supplies should be assembled: 
Vial(s) of azacitidine; vial(s) of water for injections; non-sterile surgical gloves; alcohol wipes; 
5 mL injection syringe(s) with needle(s). 
4 mL of water for injections should be drawn into the syringe, making sure to purge any air 
trapped within the syringe. 
The needle of the syringe containing the 4 mL of water for injections should be inserted through 
the rubber top of the azacitidine vial followed by injection of the water for injections into 
the vial. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Following removal of the syringe and needle, the vial should be vigorously shaken until a 
uniform cloudy suspension is achieved. After reconstitution each mL of suspension will contain 
25 mg of azacitidine (100 mg/4 mL). The reconstituted product is a homogeneous, cloudy 
suspension, free of agglomerates. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles 
or agglomerates. Do not filter the suspension after reconstitution since this could remove the 
active substance. It must be taken into account that filters are present in some adaptors, spikes 
and closed systems; therefore such systems should not be used for administration of the 
medicinal product after reconstitution. 
The rubber top should be cleaned and a new syringe with needle inserted into the vial. The vial 
should then be turned upside down, making sure the needle tip is below the level of the liquid. 
The plunger should then be pulled back to withdraw the amount of medicinal product required 
for the proper dose, making sure to purge any air trapped within the syringe. The syringe with 
needle should then be removed from the vial and the needle disposed of. 
A fresh subcutaneous needle (recommended 25-gauge) should then be firmly attached to the 
syringe. The needle should not be purged prior to injection, in order to reduce the incidence of 
local injection site reactions. 
7.  When more than 1 vial is needed all the above steps for preparation of the suspension should be 
8. 
repeated. For doses requiring more than 1 vial, the dose should be equally divided e.g., dose 
150 mg = 6 mL, 2 syringes with 3 mL in each syringe. Due to retention in the vial and needle, it 
may not be feasible to withdraw all of the suspension from the vial. 
The contents of the dosing syringe must be re-suspended immediately prior to administration. 
The temperature of the suspension at the time of injection should be approximately 20 ºC-25 ºC. 
To re-suspend, vigorously roll the syringe between the palms until a uniform, cloudy suspension 
is achieved. The product should be discarded if it contains large particles or agglomerates. 
Storage of the reconstituted product 
For immediate use 
The Vidaza suspension may be prepared immediately before use and the reconstituted suspension 
should be administered within 45 minutes. If elapsed time is greater than 45 minutes, the reconstituted 
suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. 
For later use 
When reconstituting using water for injections that has not been refrigerated, the reconstituted 
suspension must be placed in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) immediately after reconstitution, and kept in 
the refrigerator for a maximum of 8 hours. If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than 
8 hours, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. 
When reconstituting using refrigerated (2 °C to 8 °C) water for injections, the reconstituted suspension 
must be placed in a refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) immediately after reconstitution, and kept in a 
refrigerator for a maximum of 22 hours. If the elapsed time in the refrigerator is greater than 22 hours, 
the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. 
The syringe filled with reconstituted suspension should be allowed up to 30 minutes prior to 
administration to reach a temperature of approximately 20 ºC-25 ºC. If the elapsed time is longer than 
30 minutes, the suspension should be discarded appropriately and a new dose prepared. 
Calculation of an individual dose

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Jardiance 
empagliflozin 
On 15 December 2016 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Jardiance. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Boehringer Ingelheim 
International GmbH. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows:2  
“Jardiance is indicated for in the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus as to improve glycaemic control in adults as : 
Monotherapy 
When an adjunct to diet and exercise 
•          as monotherapy when alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom 
use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance 
Add-on combination therapy 
•          In combination with in addition to other glucose-lowering medicinal products for the 
treatment of diabetes including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control 
(For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and 
cardiovascular events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data 
on different combinations).” 
For information, the full indication for Jardiance will therefore read as follows: 
“Jardiance is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as 
an adjunct to diet and exercise

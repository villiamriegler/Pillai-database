1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pfizer Limited submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 05 November 2013 an application for a variation including an extension 
of indication. 
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product: 
International non-proprietary 
Presentations: 
Enbrel 
name: 
Etanercept 
See Annex A 
The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of adults with severe non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated CRP 
and/or MRI evidence, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Consequently, 
the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to include minor administrative changes in section 4.2 of 
the 50 mg SmPC (EU/1/99/126/006-011, 016-021) and in section 2 of the PL (EU/1/99/126/012 and 
022). 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, and Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/241/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/241/2011 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/241/2011. The statement as per article 28(3) 
of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 indicating compliance with this PIP was included in the marketing 
authorisation as part of variation II/145 approved in July 2012. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Enbrel contains the active ingredient etanercept, a fully human protein produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. Etanercept is comprised 
of the extracellular domains of two human tumour necrosis factor receptors (TNFR2/p75) attached to 
the Fc domain of human IgG1. Etanercept contains 934 amino acids and has an apparent molecular 
weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons. 
The pharmacotherapeutic classification of etanercept is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor 
(ATC code: L04AB01). The mechanism of action of etanercept is thought to be its competitive inhibition 
of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) binding to cell surface TNFR, preventing TNF-mediated cellular 
responses by rendering TNF biologically inactive. Etanercept may also modulate biologic responses 
controlled by additional downstream molecules (eg. cytokines, adhesion molecules, or proteinases) 
that are induced or regulated by TNF. 
Etanercept is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative 
polyarthritis, extended oligoarthritis, adolescent psoriatic arthritis and adolescent enthesitis-related 
arthritis) and plaque psoriasis (adult and paediatric). 
More specifically, one of the indications of Enbrel is the treatment of adults with severe active 
ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) is a well-characterised form of axial Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA). Currently, anti-TNF 
treatment is available for patients with established AS, defined by the modified New York Criteria, 
Enbrel 
Assessment report

which includes a radiographic criterion of sacroiliitis (i.e. bilateral grade 2-4 or unilateral grade 3-4). 
However, the advent of new consensus-based criteria allows earlier identification of patients with 
AxSpA, before significant X-ray abnormalities develop. The 2009 Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis 
(ASAS) criteria were developed to capture a broader range of AxSpA patients in clinical practice, 
including those with radiographic AxSpA (radiographic sacroiliitis according to the NY criteria) and 
without radiographic sacroiliitis (nr-AxSpA). The nr-AxSpA subgroup of AxSpA patients is closely 
related to and shares many clinical characteristics with the AS population. Patients with nr-AxSpA may 
suffer significant clinical symptoms, functional disability, and work loss. 
Unlike AS, the natural history of nr-AxSpA is not well known as longitudinal studies are lacking; 
however, available studies indicate that between 23% and 80% of patients with newly diagnosed 
AxSpA can be expected to be nr-AxSpA patients. If left untreated, nr-AxSpA may progress to AS which 
can cause permanent structural changes leading to progressive disability severely impacting the quality 
of life. Because AS is a slowly progressing disease as far as radiographic changes are concerned, 
definite sacroiliitis on plain radiographs appears relatively late, which is one reason for the long 
diagnostic delay of 5–10 years in AS. It should be noted however that while a subset of patients with 
nr-AxSpA may have early AS, it is currently unknown what proportion of patients with nr-AxSpA will 
progress to AS. 
Limited data exist on the role of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents in the treatment nr-AxSpA, 
including the effect on prevention of anatomical progression in this early disease stage before 
significant X-ray abnormalities develop. In patients with AS, there is no convincing evidence that TNF 
inhibitors can prevent progressive structural damage. In clinical trials conducted to date, anti-TNF 
agents have demonstrated similar efficacy in AxSpA patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis. 
Most recently, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol have been approved in the EU for the treatment of 
adults with nr-AxSpA. 
The purpose of this application is to extend the indication of Enbrel to the “treatment of adults with 
severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by 
elevated CRP and/or MRI evidence, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy”. 
This variation is supported by a single study (B1801031) in adult patients presenting with nr-AxSpA. 
The clinical trial supporting this extension of indication is in line with the Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (CPMP/EWP/4891/03).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
No environmental risk assessment has been provided in accordance with the CHMP guidance 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (01 June 2006) as proteins are exempted from testing because of the 
chemical structure.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of the clinical study 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Etanercept pharmacokinetics have been well characterized in adult subjects with RA, AS, or psoriasis 
and are similar among all patient populations. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adults have not 
identified pharmacokinetic differences that can be linked to specific disease observed in the subjects 
studied. 
Etanercept concentrations were not measured in the double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised 
study in adult subjects with nr-AxSpA that is included in this variation (study B1801031). The dosage 
regimen used in this study was 50 mg SC QW, identical to the approved regimen for the treatment of 
adults with RA, AS, psoriatic arthritis, or psoriasis. 
As the pharmacokinetics of etanercept have already been studied in AS, the absence of PK data in this 
population is considered acceptable by the CHMP. In addition, co-administration of Enbrel with NSAIDs 
has already been tested in previous trials and no interaction has been observed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data have been submitted. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP as the mechanism of 
action of etanercept is expected to be the same as in AS.

2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new pharmacological data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. The dosage regimen used in this study was 50 mg SC QW, identical to the approved 
regimen for the treatment of adults with RA, AS, psoriatic arthritis, or psoriasis. The mechanism of 
action of etanercept in severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is also expected to be the same 
as in AS. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study B1801031: A Multicentre, 12-Week Double Blind Placebo Controlled Randomized Study of 
Etanercept on a Background NSAID in the Treatment of Adult Subjects With Non Radiographic Axial 
spondyloarthritis With a 92-Week Open Label Extension. 
Methods 
This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period randomized study which evaluated 
the efficacy of etanercept 50 mg weekly vs. placebo in the treatment of subjects with active AxSpA 
despite optimal NSAID therapy and with non-radiographic sacroiliitis defined as those subjects who did 
not meet the modified New York (NY) criteria. 
The 12-Week double-blind results from the study and the open-label results from Week 12 through 
Week 24 are presented in the Week 24 clinical study report (CSR) included in this variation.  The open-
label period of study B1801031 is currently ongoing. 
The study design is summarized in Figure 1.

Study participants 
Main Inclusion criteria 
• 
Female or male 18 years or older but less than 50 years at the time of consent. 
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 9/57 
 
 
 
•  Diagnosis of AxSpA, as defined by the ASAS criteria with duration of symptoms of >3 months and 
<5 years at the time of consent. 
•  Active symptoms defined by a BASDAI ≥4 at the Screening Visit. 
•  Axial symptoms of back pain with a less than favourable response to current intake of NSAID at 
the optimal dose as determined by the Investigator. Subjects should have failed at least 2 NSAIDs 
(including the current one) taken separately at the optimal dose with a total combined duration of 
>4 weeks. 
•  Stable dose of NSAID for at least 14 days before baseline. 
•  Negative serum pregnancy test taken at screening, negative urine pregnancy test taken at baseline 
and negative serum pregnancy test collected at baseline 
•  Agreement by male subjects who were not surgically sterile and female subjects who were not 
surgically sterile or post-menopausal to use a highly effective method of birth control for the 
duration of the study. 
•  Adequate screening for TB in accordance with local country guideline. 
Main exclusion criteria 
•  Any previous treatment with a TNFα inhibitor, B/T cell inhibitor or other biologic agent or 
immunosuppressive agent for a condition other than IBD. 
•  Current or previous treatment within 6 months for IBD with any TNFα inhibitor or any other 
immunosuppressant. 
•  Any orthopaedic or medical condition that could cause chronic back pain such as spondylodiscitis, 
tumour or advance discopathy. 
• 
Evidence of IBD flare or uveitis within 6 months of baseline. 
•  Radiological sacroiliitis grade 3-4 unilaterally or grade ≥2 bilaterally as defined by the Modified NY 
Criteria. 
•  Concurrent treatment with more than 1 NSAID or change in dose within 14 days at baseline. 
•  DMARDS other than methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine within 4 weeks of 
baseline (Note: Subjects may have been taking only one allowable DMARD at a time). 
•  Dose of prednisone >10 mg/day (or equivalent) or change in dose within 4 weeks before baseline. 
• 
Intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, or SC corticosteroid within 4 weeks before baseline. 
•  Current or recent (within 2 years) active TB infection; untreated latent TB. 
These selection criteria defined a population of patients with a diagnosis of nr-AxSpA (as defined by 
the Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis criteria) and clearly excluded patients with AS. Furthermore, 
patients had to present with active symptoms including back pain not responding to NSAIDs. The study 
population was adequately selected although the objective signs of inflammation described in the 
SmPC indication (elevated CRP and/or MRI evidence) were not a condition for eligibility. A high-
sensitivity assay to determine CRP in a central laboratory was chosen in order to ensure the reliability 
of the diagnosis and investigate the potential correlation of this marker with disease activity and 
therapeutic effect.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved ASAS 40 at Week 12. ASAS 40 was 
derived from the following 4 AS assessments: Subject Assessment of Disease Activity, pain, physical 
function, and inflammation. If a subject had a missing evaluation for any of the 4 AS assessment 
domains, the subject was to be considered a non-responder for analysis. ASAS 40 responders were 
defined as subjects who satisfied the following criteria: 
1.  An improvement of at least 40% and absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 cm 
scale (converted from 0 to 100 mm) or an improvement of 100% for those domains that had a 
baseline score <2 in at least 3 of the following four domains: 
•  Subject Assessment of Disease Activity,  
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 11/57 
 
 
•  Mean of subject assessment of nocturnal pain and total back pain (note: total back pain was 
also used for the ASAS calculation in accordance with EMA 2009 guideline), 
• 
• 
Function represented by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) score,  
Inflammation represented by the mean of the 2 morning stiffness-related BASDAI scores. 
2.  No worsening at all in any of the domains. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects who achieve ASAS 40 at time points other than 12 weeks; 
Proportion of subjects who achieve ASAS 20; 
Proportion of subjects who achieve ASAS 5/6 (the ASAS 5/6 required a 20% improvement in 5 of 6 
criteria: the 4 domains of the ASAS response, a measure of spinal mobility [lateral spinal flexion], 
and high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]); 
•  Changes from baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS); 
• 
Proportion of subjects with ASAS partial remission (ASAS partial remission was based on the same 
4 domains as the other ASAS endpoints, partial remission was defined as a score of 2 or less [on a 
scale of 0-10 cm] for each of the 4 domains); 
• 
Time to ASAS partial remission; 
•  Changes from baseline in Subject Assessment of Disease Activity (Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]); 
•  Changes from baseline in the VAS Physician Global Assessment;  
•  Changes from baseline in VAS nocturnal and total back pain over time; 
•  Changes from baseline in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and its 
components; 
•  Changes from baseline in the BASDAI and its components; 
• 
Proportion of subjects who achieved BASDAI 20 and BASDAI 50; 
•  Changes in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Patient Global Assessment Score (BAS-G); 
•  Changes from baseline in spinal mobility as measured by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology 
Index (BASMI) (and its individual components), and occiput-to-wall distance, and chest expansion;

•  Changes from baseline in tender and swollen joint counts (44 count); 
•  Changes from baseline on dactylitis and enthesitis score (Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis 
Entheses Score [MASES]); 
•  Changes from baseline in the acute phase reactants hsCRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
(ESR); 
•  Health Outcomes Assessments using the following instruments: Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EuroQol EQ-5D 
Health State Profile (EQ-5D) Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), 36-Item Short-Form Health 
Survey (SF-36), Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), Ankylosing Spondylitis Work 
Stability Scale (ASWIS), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep, MFI, Patient Acceptable Symptom

Exploratory endpoint 
Changes from baseline in inflammation of the sacroiliac (SI) joint at 12 weeks as measured by MRI. 
X-rays and MRI evaluations (up to week 104) were conducted by a central independent CRO. The 
modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) and the Radiographic Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Spinal Score (RASSS) are used to evaluate the radiographic changes of the spine from 
baseline to Weeks 104. The AS spine MRI score for acute changes (ASspiMRI-a) is used to assess 
inflammation in the spine and the SPARCC spine and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) scoring method is used to 
assess the inflammation of the spine and sacroiliac joints from baseline to Weeks 12, 48 and 104. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the original primary endpoint, ASAS 20 response. For the 
ASAS 20 endpoint, assuming response rates of at least 55% in the ETN plus NSAID group and no more 
than 30% in the placebo plus NSAID group (based on historical data supplied by ETN studies), 100 
subjects per arm would be needed to provide approximately 90% power using 2-sided testing at alpha 
= 0.05. Based on ASAS 40 data from these studies, plus response data from studies reported in the 
literature for other TNF-α inhibitors, it was expected that the response rates for each group would be 
somewhat lower for the ASAS 40 than the ASAS 20, but that the magnitude of the difference between 
groups would remain in the range of 25%, in which case the planned sample size would provide power 
at least as great as that for the ASAS 20 endpoint. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ETN 50 mg subcutaneously (SC) 
weekly plus a stable background NSAID at optimal anti-inflammatory dosage as determined by the 
Investigator, or ETN placebo plus background NSAID for 12 weeks. Randomisation was centralised 
using IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) and stratified based on positive or negative sacroiliitis 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The study was subject-, investigator- and sponsor-blinded in the double-blind period. Pre-filled 
syringes of identical appearance containing etanercept or placebo were supplied. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analyses for this study were done after all subjects had completed the 12 week, double-
blind phase of the study and all endpoints through 12 weeks were analysed. An interim analysis for the 
subsequent open phase of the study was planned after all subjects had completed the Week 24 visit 
and a database through Week 24 had been finalized. The purpose of this analysis was to summarize 
24-week efficacy and safety. 
Analysis sets 
• 
Full Analysis Population: Defined as all randomized subjects included in the study. 
•  mITT Population: The primary analysis set was a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population 
defined as all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of study drug, had at least one on-
therapy evaluation and met the ASAS classification criteria for AxSpA. This was the primary 
population for all efficacy analyses during the double-blind period. 
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 13/57 
 
 
• 
Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Population: The per-protocol population was defined as a subset of the 
mITT population excluding subjects who had a protocol deviation that was thought to potentially 
affect efficacy variables. Potential subjects to be excluded from this population were initially 
identified programmatically and then confirmed by the study clinician prior to unblinding the 
database. 
•  Safety Analysis Population: The safety analysis set for the double-blind period was defined as all 
randomized subjects who took at least one dose of study drug during that phase of the study. 
Treatment misallocations 
•  Randomized but not treated: excluded from the efficacy analyses and the safety analyses 
•  Randomized but took at least one dose of incorrect treatment: reported under randomized 
treatment group for all efficacy and safety analyses, but omitted from per-protocol analyses. 
Handling of Missing Values 
Unless otherwise specified, missing items for observations on the individual items of the derived 
efficacy and health outcome scales were handled as follows. If more than 20% of the items were 
missing, the total scores for these scales were considered missing. If 20% or fewer items were 
missing, the average of the available items was multiplied by the total number of items to get a 
derived total score. 
When the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was being employed, efficacy assessments 
were handled in the following manner: if the scheduled assessment was missing, the immediately 
preceding scheduled assessment was used; baseline data was not carried forward unless otherwise 
noted. This method was used for primary and secondary endpoints. 
As sensitivity analyses for the double-blind period, modelling procedures that included all available 
data from Weeks 2 through 12 were used. 
The missing data were handled using LOCF which is acceptable in this situation where even placebo 
patients improved during the course of the trial. A variety of other sensitivity analyses have also been 
provided to allow adequate assessment of the effects of the missing data on the results. 
Analysis of primary endpoint 
The comparison between 2 treatment groups was performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) chi-square test, stratified by positive or negative sacroiliitis MRI and geographic region. The 
value used was the Week 12 visit; for subjects who discontinued before Week 12, the last evaluation 
after baseline and prior to discontinuation was to be used (LOCF). 
As a sensitivity analysis, subjects who discontinued before Week 12 (including subjects who had a 
Baseline Visit only) were counted as non-responders instead of using an LOCF approach for the missing 
data. 
As an additional sensitivity analysis, a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model, using a logit link, 
a binomial distribution and an auto-regressive correlation structure, with treatment groups, visits and 
their interaction as fixed factors, was used. The model also included factors of positive or negative 
sacroiliitis MRI and geographic region. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted by key demographic and baseline disease characteristics. In 
addition a logistic regression model with factors for treatment subgroup and treatment by subgroup 
interaction was fitted to evaluate consistency of response within the levels of the subgroup.

Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 383 subjects were screened for the study, of these, 158 subjects were considered screen 
failures. The remaining 225 subjects (full analysis population) were randomised and 224 subjects 
received study drug: 111 subjects were randomised to the etanercept 50 mg dose group and 113 
subjects were randomized to the placebo group (one subject randomised to placebo did not receive 
study drug). 
Of the 209 subjects who completed the double-blind period, 208 subjects continued into the open-label 
period of the study (one subject in the placebo group who completed the double-blind period did not 
enter the open-label period). A total of 200 subjects reached the Week 24 time point: 98 subjects in 
the ETN/ETN group and 102 in the placebo/ETN group (Table 1).

A high percentage of subjects completed the first phase of the trial, about 93% for the double-blind 
12-week period and 89% for the 24-week overall period. The reasons for discontinuation were the 
same in the active and placebo groups (double-blind period), except for adverse events (3 vs. 1, 
respectively). 
Recruitment 
The trial was conducted at 48 centres in 14 countries, with 68% of the randomised patients being from 
the EU: 
• 
EU (34 centres; 153 patients): Belgium (3; 26 patients), Czech Republic (3; 23 patients), Finland 
(2; 5 patients), France (4; 13 patients), Germany (5; 18 patients), Hungary (6; 42 patients), 
Netherlands (2; 12 patients), Spain (4; 9 patients), UK (5; 5 patients) 
•  Russia (3 centres; 6 patients) 
•  Korea (3 centres; 20 patients) and Taiwan (3 centres; 29 patients) 
•  Argentina (2 centres; 3 patients) and Colombia (3 centres; 14 patients) 
The first patient was enrolled on 05-05-2011 and the last patient was completed (24-week period) on 
19-02-2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The main amendment, which was implemented before enrolment started, was the change of the 
primary endpoint from ASAS 20 to ASAS 40. In addition, ASAS 50 and ASAS 70 were deleted.  
Baseline data 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics for the full analysis population (225 randomised 
subjects) are presented in Tables 2 to 4. 
In general, the baseline values for the demographic and disease characteristics were similar between 
the 2 treatment groups. The mean (SD) age for the overall randomised study population was 32 (8) 
years with a range of 18 to 49 years. The majority of subjects in the study were male (60%) and 
White (73%). Overall, the mean (SD) duration of disease symptoms was 2.5 (1.8) years with a range 
of 0.3 to 15.6 years. Approximately 20% of the subjects were taking a DMARD at baseline, and nearly 
all subjects (99%) were taking an NSAID at baseline (2 subjects in the placebo group were not 100% 
compliant with taking NSAIDs for the 4 weeks prior to study baseline).  The mean (SD) hsCRP value 
was 6.4 (10.4) mg/L. The mean (SD) values for the patient and physician global assessments of 
disease activity were 5.7 (2.2) cm and 5.4 (1.9) cm, respectively.  The mean (SD) BASDAI total score 
was 5.96 (1.81). 
The patients were well distributed across the treatment groups for demographic and disease 
characteristics. Overall, 77% had active inflammation on MRI highly suggestive of sacroiliitis associated 
with SpA; however, only 85% corresponded to the target SmPC indication (patients with elevated CRP 
and/or MRI evidence of inflammation). 
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 16/57 
 
 
 
The median hs-CRP was notably lower than the mean presented in Table 3, 2.23 in the total population 
(range 0.13 – 78.9 mg/L), in line with cohorts published in the literature (e.g. 2.7 mg/L in Poddubnyy, 
2010).

addition, 2 subjects included in the mITT population did not provide data for most efficacy analyses, 
thus resulting in 105 subjects in the ETN group and 108 subjects in the placebo group. An additional 9 
subjects were excluded from the PP population, because of treatment deviations (more than 1 DMARD, 
non-compliance, incorrect treatment) or deviations from eligibility criteria.

Key secondary endpoints 
ASAS 20 (mITT, LOCF) 
A significantly greater percentage of subjects in the ETN group achieved an ASAS 20 response 
compared with the placebo group at Weeks 2 (30.5% [32/105] vs. 16.0% [17/106]; p = 0.019) and 
12 (52.4% [55/105] vs. 36.1% [39/108]; p = 0.019). Similar to what was observed for ASAS 40 
response, at the end of the open-label period, both treatment groups achieved comparable ASAS 20 
responses (65 - 71%). 
ASAS 5/6 (mITT, LOCF) 
The proportion of subjects in the ETN and placebo groups with at least a 20% improvement in 5 of 6 
criteria in ASAS showed a similar pattern as ASAS 40 response. A statistically significant improvement 
in ASAS 5/6 was observed in favor of the ETN group beginning at the Week 2 time point (15.7% 
[16/102] vs. 2.9% [3/105]; p = 0.002) and continued through to the last evaluation of the double-
blind period (33.0% [34/103] vs. 10.4% [11/106]; p < 0.0001). The proportion continued to increase

during the open-label period in the ETN/ETN group (40.2% [39/97] at Week 24) and in the PBO/ETN 
group (41.7% [43/103] at Week 24). 
ASAS partial remission (mITT, LOCF) 
The proportion of subjects in the ETN and placebo groups who achieved a partial remission in ASAS 
score showed a similar pattern as ASAS 40 response; at week 12, it was 24.8% (26/105) and 11.9% 
(13/109), respectively (p = 0.02). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of partial remission at 
Week 12 was 43.3% in the ETN group and 22.3% in the PBO group (log rank test p = 0.002) (Figure 
3).

Components of ASAS (mITT, LOCF) 
At Week 12, statistically significant differences in the mean changes from baseline were observed 
between ETN and PBO groups for all ASAS components (Table 8).

ASDAS hsCRP and hsCRP (mITT, LOCF) 
A significantly greater percentage of subjects in the ETN group had ASDAS hsCRP inactive disease (< 
1.3) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 compared with the placebo group (Table 9). Likewise, statistically 
significant differences in the mean changes from baseline were observed between ETN and PBO groups 
at all-time points. The mean score further decreased during the open-label period and reached 
approximately 50% of the baseline score at 24 weeks (from 3 to 1.5).

BASDAI total score (mITT, LOCF) 
Patients in the ETN group had a significantly greater mean change from baseline in BASDAI total score 
compared with the placebo group beginning at Week 2 and continuing through the last evaluation of 
the double-blind-period (Table 11). The mean BASDAI total score continued to show an improving 
trend in the ETN/ETN group over the course of the open-label period. At Week 24, the response 
corresponded to an improvement in BASDAI total score of about 50%. 
Likewise, a significantly greater percentage of subjects in the ETN group were BASDAI 50 responders 
compared with the placebo group throughout the double-blind period (e.g. at Week 12: 43.8% 
[46/105] vs. 23.8% [26/109]; p = 0.0029).  At week 24, this proportion was 57% (116/205) in the

Mobility measurements (mITT, LOCF) 
There was no statistically significant difference in the BASMI total score between the treatment groups 
during the double-blind period. At Week 12, the response corresponded to an improvement of 22.7% 
for the ETN group and 21.3% for the placebo group. The mean change from baseline in the BASMI 
components (cervical rotation, Tragus-to-wall distance, modified Schober’s test, intermalleolar 
distance, and lateral side flexion) was analysed. With the exception of lateral side flexion at Week 12, 
there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups during the double-blind 
period. 
The mean change from baseline in chest expansion and occiput-to-wall test was also analysed. With 
the exception of chest expansion at Week 2, there were no statistically significant differences between 
the treatment groups during the double-blind period. 
Imaging endpoints (Week 12, mITT, LOCF) 
Spine 
Patients in the ETN group had a significantly greater mean change from baseline in the SPARCC-Spine 
6 discovertebral units (DVU) Total Score compared with the placebo group (-2.12 [n=95] vs. -1.16 
[n=105]; p = 0.041). The response corresponded to an improvement of 45.4% for the ETN group and 
33.4% for the placebo group. 
Likewise, patients in the ETN group had a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline in 
the Ankylosing Spondylitis spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging-activity (ASspiMRI-a) total score 
compared with the placebo group (-0.73 vs. -0.33; p = 0.013). The response corresponded to an 
improvement of 40.9% for the ETN group and 25.6% for the placebo group. 
SI joint (exploratory endpoint) 
Patients in the ETN group had a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline in the 
SPARCC score for the SI joint compared with the placebo group (-3.77 [n=95] vs. -0.84 [n=105]; p< 
0.001). The response corresponded to an improvement of 46.9% for the ETN group and 10.9% for the 
placebo group.

At Week 12, a significant difference between ETN and PBO was observed for the following outcomes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
increase in EQ-5D VAS score (number of patients: 84/92; p = 0.039) – corresponding 
improvement of 16.3% vs. 5.8%, respectively; 
proportion of patients with EQ-5D total index score improvement ≥0.05 (51/85 vs. 40/93; p = 
0.034); 
increase in SF-36 PCS (general physical function) (number of patients: 85/94; p = 0.013) – 
corresponding improvement of 16.4% vs. 10.2%, respectively; 
proportion of subjects with an SF-36 PCS improvement ≥ 5 (44/85 vs. 33/94; p = 0.035); 
decrease in % impairment while working due to health problems as assessed in WPAI (number of 
patients: 48/50; p = 0.046); 
decrease in % activity impairment due to health problems as assessed in WPAI (number of 
patients: 85/92; p = 0.040). 
No statistical difference at Week 12 was observed for the following outcomes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
proportion of subjects with an EQ-5D VAS score > 82; 
proportion of subjects with an SF-36 PCS improvement ≥ 2.5; 
change in EQ-5D Utility score; 
change in SF-36 MCS (mental component summary); 
change in ASQoL score; 
proportion of subjects employed and work time missed as assessed by WPAI. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Statistically significant differences between ETN and placebo groups were also observed at Week 12 for 
the VAS Physician Global Assessment, ESR, number of swollen joints, and enthesitis (MASES) score.  
However, the differences at Week 12 were not significant for the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Patient 
Global Assessment Score and the number of tender joints. 
Ancillary analyses 
For the primary endpoint, ASAS 40 response at Week 12, efficacy was evaluated in a number of pre-
specified subgroups (Table 12). Among all the subgroup analyses, only race and history of uveitis 
yielded a significant interaction p-value, but the data are difficult to interpret due to the small sample 
size of non-white subjects and patients with a history of uveitis.

To further understand the effect of various hsCRP and MRI subgroups on ASAS 40 response, additional 
post-hoc analyses were performed. 
Baseline hsCRP 
Previous studies in patients with nr-AxSpA have shown that TNF inhibition had a greater effect in 
subjects with elevated baseline hsCRP than those with normal levels. A pre-specified analysis in the 
current study suggested this was the case, but did not reach statistical significance. To further evaluate 
this relationship, an analysis was performed with hsCRP as a continuous variable. The difference

between ETN and placebo response rates increased with increasing hsCRP levels. These data showed a 
significant relationship between baseline hsCRP levels and placebo-corrected response to etanercept (p 
=0.0033; Figure 4).

Fitted logistic regression of ASAS40 on baseline hsCRP 
Baseline MRI Positivity and Sacroiliac Joint SPARRC Score 
As was shown in Table 12, there was no significant subgroup by treatment interaction when the MRI 
positive subjects were compared to the MRI negative subjects. Due to the relatively small number of 
subjects in the MRI negative subgroup; these results may not fully inform the effect of MRI status on 
ASAS 40.  In order to further examine the potential relationship between MRI findings and clinical 
response, SIJ SPARCC scores (<2 versus ≥2) were analyzed. There was no significant interaction 
between treatment and SIJ SPARCC score <2 versus ≥2 on ASAS 40 response, but the etanercept 
effect was numerically higher in subjects with SIJ SPARCC scores ≥2 (41.8% vs. 17.9%, respectively).  
An approach using a continuous analysis using baseline SIJ SPARCC scores as a potential predictor was 
also evaluated. The difference between etanercept and placebo response rates increased with 
increasing SPARCC scores which resulted in an interaction p-value that approached statistical 
significance (interaction p-value=0.1458; Figure 5). The data suggest that etanercept-treated subjects 
with higher baseline SPARCC scores have higher ASAS 40 response rates.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study supporting this extension of indication to the treatment of nr-AxSpA is a double-blind 
placebo-controlled trial of 12-week duration, followed by an additional 12-week open-label treatment 
period where all patients received etanercept. 
Particular attention was paid to the selection of the patients based on adherence to the 2009 ASAS 
classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis with careful exclusion of patients with ankylosing 
spondylitis; this was confirmed by central X-rays and MRI reading and the use of high sensitivity CRP 
by central determination. Also the requirement of a BASDAI score ≥ 4 ensured that only patients with 
moderate to severe disease were enrolled. 
Etanercept was added to background therapy as administered in clinical practice. Back pain had to 
have failed to respond to at least two NSAIDs and treatment with an NSAID at a stable dose was to be 
continued throughout the study; the combination to one DMARD at a stable dose was also authorised.  
Etanercept dosing was the same as recommended in AS (50 mg sc weekly). 
Adequate efficacy outcomes have been used in line with the 2009 CHMP guideline for treatment of AS.  
The primary endpoint is ASAS 40 and a wide range of secondary endpoints include ASAS 20, ASAS 
5/6, ASAS partial remission, BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, hsCRP and ESR, various quality of life 
instruments, and MRI imaging of the spine and sacroiliac joints. 
The trial was conducted in 48 centres, mainly in Europe (EU and Russia) and Asia with a few additional 
patients from Latin America. GCP compliance issues were found in one centre in Taiwan and the data 
of this centre have been excluded in one of the sensitivity analyses. Statistical methods are acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
The exclusion from the mITT population of the 10 patients (4%) that did not meet the disease 
definition is acceptable. Baseline characteristics in this population were similar to those in the FAS. Of 
note, in the mITT population, 88% patients corresponded to the target SmPC indication (patients with 
elevated CRP and/or MRI evidence of inflammation). 
An additional sensitivity analysis was performed in the All treated population (n=224). Only two 
patients were excluded from this analysis (one in each arm) due to lack of post-baseline data. Since 
the number is so small and equally balanced between treatments, it is not a concerning issue. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
From a total of 383 subjects screened, 225 were randomised. Most completed the trial and compliance 
to therapy was high. The patient population is representative of the target population as described in 
the SmPC; most patients had MRI signs of sacroiliitis (77%) and 85% had either elevated hsCRP or 
ASAS MRI sacroiliitis. 
The single pivotal trial met its primary endpoint with a high level of significance and the results are 
robust to the method of analysis and the choice of analysis population, as shown by essentially the 
same results in all the sensitivity analyses performed. About one third of the patients responded to 
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 32/57 
 
 
 
etanercept after 12 weeks (32.4%), twice as much as those responding to placebo (15.8%) and the 
response rate increased further over the subsequent 12 weeks during the open-label treatment phase. 
The results of the primary endpoint are supported by the results of all key secondary endpoints 
(usually with high level of significance) except for mobility measurements, for which the duration of 
observation may be too short. The reduction in active inflammatory lesions (bone marrow oedema) 
detected at MRI, which appeared statistically different from placebo in both the spine and sacroiliac 
joints, is particularly relevant and provides objective evidence of anti-inflammatory effects at the lesion 
site. These results are consistent with those of the ESTHER trial, which compared the effects of 
etanercept and sulfasalazine in early axial spondyloarthritis on MRI activity (Song, 2011). 
In addition, a number of quality of life instruments were able to differentiate etanercept from placebo 
after 12 weeks of treatment, including BASFI, the EQ-5D VAS score, the SF-36 physical component, 
and even some items of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. 
Etanercept was consistently superior to placebo in all patient subgroups, either statistically or at least 
numerically, except in non-white subpopulation and outside Europe. This is likely to be a chance 
finding as suggested by the MAH given the small number of patients. Previous studies have shown 
similar efficacy of etanercept in Asian AS patients. 
Importantly, the effect of etanercept appeared more pronounced when inflammatory signs were 
initially more marked (as reflected by CRP or MRI). In the target population of patients with positive 
MRI or elevated hs-CRP (as defined in the SmPC), an ASAS 40 response was achieved in 35% (33/94) 
of the patients treated with etanercept vs. 17% (16/95) of the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.0048). 
Finally, it is noteworthy that further improvement in the secondary endpoints was observed up to 24 
weeks, acknowledging that this may be overestimated due to the open-label nature of the trial design 
after the first 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient 
not responding within this time period (as described in the product information). 
The open-label period of study B1801031 is currently ongoing and its results will be submitted by the 
MAH to show maintenance of efficacy (as described in the RMP). Furthermore, the need for continuous 
therapy to maintain clinical response or remission over time is currently unknown. As anti-TNFs have 
not been shown to prevent progression of structural damage while they are not devoid of serious risks 
on the long-term, treatment interruption in stable condition is justified. Given that AxSpA is a disease 
with fluctuating symptomatology and patients with non-radiological disease are likely to start anti-TNF 
treatment early in life, the possibility of treatment interruptions is especially relevant. An investigator-
sponsored trial conducted by German rheumatologists in 76 subjects with early AxSpA, of which half 
had nr-AxSpA, has shown that about 70% of subjects in remission after 48 weeks of treatment with 
etanercept relapsed within 24 weeks on average. When retreated, the subjects responded to re-
treatment, although full remission was not achieved in all cases (ESTHER trial, Song IH et al, 2011, 
2012, and 2013). Furthermore, these results appear consistent with those observed in larger trials 
conducted by the MAH in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis. 
However, given the small size of the ESTHER trial, the MAH will to conduct a single-arm trial (study 
B1801381) in a larger sample of nr-AxSpA patients to refine the description of the relapse profile after 
treatment discontinuation and evaluate the effects of re-treatment (as described in the RMP). 
During the procedure the MAH agreed amend the wording of the indication from:” Treatment of adults 
with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated 
by elevated CRP and/or MRI evidence, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy” 
to “Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated CRP and/or MRI evidence, who have had an inadequate 
response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs” as this is consistent with the clinical trial supporting 
this extension of indication..

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A well-designed trial has been conducted to support this extension of indication and its results provide 
convincing evidence of the effects of etanercept on the symptoms and signs of inflammation, including 
MRI changes, associated with the disease as well as of its short-term benefit to the quality of life of the 
target patient population. Information on the benefit/risk profile of etanercept in the long-term (2-year 
treatment) will be provided by the ongoing B1801031 trial (as described in the RMP). In addition, the 
effects of treatment withdrawal and re-treatment after relapse will be further evaluated in study 
B1801381 (as described in the RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Etanercept has been marketed since November 1998 and has been well tolerated with a favourable 
risk/benefit profile under recommended conditions for use. 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions of Enbrel are injection site reactions, allergic reactions, 
and infections like all TNF antagonists as they affect the immune system. Serious infections, including 
opportunistic infections and reactivation of tuberculosis or hepatitis B virus infection have been 
reported. These therapies also imply a potential risk of cancer and of autoimmune reactions. Acute 
uveitis, Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, lupus, pancytopenia, demyelinating events have been reported. 
Supportive safety data are provided by the information collected in Study B1801031.  Immunogenicity 
data were not collected in this study. 
Patient exposure 
The safety population consists of 224 subjects who received at least one dose of study medication; 111 
subjects received etanercept and 113 received placebo. During the 12-week double-blind period, the 
median exposure to etanercept was 85 days with a range of 1 to 95 days, and the median exposure to 
placebo was 85 days with a range of 8 to 100 days. Total exposure during the double-blind period was 
24.10 subject-years for the ETN group and 25.29 subject-years for the placebo group. 
During the open-label period of the study, there were 102 subjects in the ETN/ETN group and 106 
subjects in the placebo/ETN group. Between Weeks 12 to 24 of the open-label period, the median 
duration of etanercept treatment was 78 days with a range of 15 to 92 days for the ETN/ETN group, 
and 78 days with a range of 8 to 90 days for the placebo/ETN group. Total exposure to etanercept 
during the open-label period was 23.10 subject-years for the ETN/ETN group and 24.05 subject-years 
for the placebo/ETN group. 
Adverse events 
A tabulated summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is provided in Table 14. 
During the double-blind period (through Week 12), TEAEs were reported in 63 (56.8%) subjects in the 
ETN group and 51 (45.1%) subjects in the placebo group. In general, the numbers and types of AEs 
were similar between the 2 treatment groups, with the exception of injection site disorders. Three (3) 
events were reported with an incidence of ≥5% in either treatment group: injection site erythema, 
injection site reaction, and nasopharyngitis (Table 15). 
During the open-label period (between Week 12 and Week 24), TEAEs were reported by 35 (34.3%) 
subjects in the ETN/ETN group and by 53 (50.0%) subjects in the placebo/ETN group (Table 15). The

subjects who switched from placebo to etanercept had a higher rate of injection site disorders 
compared to the subjects who received etanercept in both treatment periods. No events were reported 
with an incidence of ≥5% in either treatment group (Table 16).

During the double-blind period, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in etanercept-treated patients than 
in placebo-treated patients due to injection site reactions and skin reactions. Although nasopharyngitis 
was more frequent in the ETN group, upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis were more 
frequent in the PBO group. Overall, no difference in the occurrence of infections was found over this 
short period. During the open-label treatment period, TEAEs were more frequent in the group of 
patients initially treated with placebo as expected. Overall, the occurrence of infections appeared the 
same as in the first 12 weeks of treatment. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred through Week 24 of the study and the SAEs reported are summarised in Table 17.

SAEs occurred with equal frequency in the two treatment groups and appeared disease-related. There 
was no serious infection except for an anal abscess in the PBO group, a likely complication of an 
underlying lesion. 
Adverse events of special interest generally identified for close clinical monitoring in subjects receiving 
therapy with TNF inhibitors include malignancy, lymphoma, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, 
demyelinating disease, blood dyscrasias related to bone marrow suppression, autoimmune disorders, 
IBD, and liver function abnormalities. 
There were no cases of malignancy, lymphoma, opportunistic infection, tuberculosis, demyelinating 
disease, blood dyscrasias related to bone marrow suppression, or IBD that occurred during the first 24 
weeks of study B1801031. Acute anterior uveitis flare was reported in 3 patients (1 on PBO, 2 on ETN 
during the open-label period). 
After the Week 24 data cut-off for study B1801031, one opportunistic infection (herpes zoster, 
involving 2 dermatomes – during the 6th month of therapy) and one event of demyelinating disease 
(multiple sclerosis – diagnosed 9 months after starting ETN) were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
During the double-blind period, 5 subjects (2.23%) had a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 [CTCAE] Grade 3 or 4 laboratory test result, all related to liver tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin): 
3 in the ETN group and 2 in the PBO group. One subject experienced both an ALT and an AST test 
result of >5 X ULN, which corresponded to an AE of hepatitis. A total of 4 subjects (2 in each group) 
had elevated bilirubin. Of the 4 subjects with elevated bilirubin, two experienced transient increases in 
bilirubin, one had a history of Gilbert’s syndrome, and one had a history of hepatic steatosis. 
Overall, 5 subjects (3 ETN/2 PBO) had increases in AST greater than 2 X ULN and 10 subjects (7 ETN/ 
3 PBO) had increases in ALT greater than 2 X ULN. Of these subjects, 3 subjects (two in the ETN group 
and one in the PBO group) had an increase in ALT/AST >3 X ULN. Of these 3 subjects, one reported an 
AE of hepatitis (and discontinued ETN treatment), one reported an AE of abnormal hepatic function

(ALT/AST normalized while receiving ETN), and the third had a history of hepatic steatosis. An 
additional ALT elevation, mild and transient, was reported as an AE in the placebo group. 
During the open-label period, 9 subjects (4.33%) had a CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 laboratory test result: 
• 
• 
• 
decreased total neutrophils, which returned to normal at the next visit (2) 
one new case of transient elevated bilirubin and 3 remaining cases continuing from the double-
blind period 
transient abnormal potassium level (2) 
•  ALT increase (1). 
Overall, 1 subject had increases in AST greater than 2 X ULN and 6 subjects had increases in ALT 
greater than 2 X ULN. Of these subjects, one subject in the placebo/ETN group had an increase in ALT 
greater than 3 X ULN which was associated with an AE of liver function abnormality; ETN was 
temporarily stopped and re-introduced after AE resolution. An additional ALT elevation, mild and 
transient was reported as an AE. 
No subject was identified as meeting Hy’s Law criteria based on abnormal liver function test results 
during the trial. 
In conclusion, elevations of ALT/AST, usually transient, were slightly more frequent under etanercept 
treatment than placebo.  They were not associated with high bilirubin levels or clinical correlates. One 
case was reported as hepatitis, the patient discontinued ETN treatment, and ALT (but not AST) 
normalised within a month. Of note, all five subjects who had increased levels of ALT/AST reported as 
an AE were located in Asia. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events

Post marketing experience 
A review of the MAH global safety database was conducted to identify reports of AxSpA as an indication 
for etanercept treatment.  The search included medically confirmed cases reported all time through 02 
February 2013, which contained the MedDRA version 16.0 Preferred Term Spondylitis as an indication.  
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 39/57 
 
 
 
The search identified a total of 125 cases fitting the search criteria. The cases were individually 
reviewed to determine relevant cases reporting AxSpA as an indication. 
Of the 125 cases, 121 either reported non-specific spondyloarthritis, peripheral AxSpA, or AS. The 
remaining four relevant reports involved three males and one female. The patients ranged in age from 
21 to 54 years (mean 37.25 years, median 37 years). The reported events include lack of effect (2), 
uveitis (1), herpes zoster (1), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (1), increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (1), hepatic steatosis (1), and Sjogren’s syndrome (1). Herpes zoster, 
increased ALT, increased AST and uveitis are known adverse events associated with etanercept while 
hepatic steatosis and Sjogren’s syndrome are not listed adverse events in the etanercept CDS. 
On review, the patient reporting abnormal liver enzymes, in which ALT had a four times increase after 
two months of etanercept treatment and “marginal increase” of AST after four months of etanercept 
treatment, was found to have hepatic steatosis. Etanercept and concomitant drug, diclofenac, were 
withdrawn and the patient was recovering from the increased liver enzymes. Outcome of hepatic 
steatosis was not known at the time of the report.  
Uveitis occurred in a patient with a pre-existing chronic uveitis. This case also reported lack of effect, 
however, information on inefficacy was unclear on review; etanercept treatment was continuing at the 
time of the report. 
In another case, a patient experienced Sjogren’s syndrome after 2 months of etanercept 50 mg 
subcutaneously of unknown frequency and recovered with treatment. Etanercept was discontinued 1 
month later because it was not effective to treat the patient’s AxSpA. 
In the last case, herpes zoster developed after 1 month of etanercept treatment. Etanercept was 
discontinued and the patient recovered with treatment. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data have been collected up to 24 weeks in the supporting trial. 
During the double-blind period, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in etanercept-treated patients than 
in placebo-treated patients essentially due to injection site reactions and skin reactions. No difference 
in the occurrence of infections was found and the incidence of SAEs was similar. Liver enzymes 
(ALT/AST) abnormalities were slightly more frequent, but usually transient. 
No new safety concern emerged during the open-label treatment period. No adverse events of special 
interest were reported except for acute anterior uveitis flares (a feature of SpA), and one case each of 
herpes zoster and multiple sclerosis (after the Week 24 data cut-off). This emphasises the need to 
restrict the duration of treatment in patients that are not responding to therapy (as described in the 
product information). 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of etanercept in this indication is expected to be similar to its known safety profile in 
AS. This is indeed the case as shown by the results of the first 24 weeks of treatment. No new safety 
signal has been identified in this evaluation. No change to the safety sections of the SmPC has been 
proposed by the MAH, which is acceptable. However, as a clinical response is usually achieved within 
12 weeks, a warning has been added in section 4.2 about the need to reconsider continuing therapy in 
a patient not responding within this time period. 
The MAH agreed to conduct a study in nr-AxSpA patients to evaluate the duration of remission after 
withdrawal of therapy as well as safety of treatment after disease flare (as described in the RMP). The 
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 40/57 
 
 
information obtained from the proposed study B1801381 will be complemented by the results from the 
current ongoing study B1801031, which will provide an assessment of the long-term safety associated 
with continuous etanercept treatment (up to 104 weeks) in this population (as described in the RMP).  
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 02 February 2014.  
The Annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 5.1 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for etanercept (Enbrel) in the treatment of adults with severe non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated CRP 
and/or MRI evidence, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy is acceptable. 
Following the PRAC meeting in June 2014, the MAH submitted a revised Risk Management Plan version 
5.2 in order to update the PhV Plan with the most recent changes in the milestones of some of the 
studies. This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

Educational materials 
Training is given to patients, 
care givers and healthcare 
professionals (HCPs) in the 
appropriate use of the PFP. 
The experiences from 
providing training to patients 
in the US, where a similar 
Enbrel PFP was introduced for 
more than two years prior to 
launch of the PFP in the EU, 
have been utilised. 
Based on experience from the 
US, EU post launch experience 
and market research studies, 
numerous enhancements 
have been made to the HCP 
and patient training materials 
and resources including: 
•  Market research in the 
form of a “use study” was 
conducted with European 
rheumatology and 
dermatology patients in 
order to identify 
improvements in the 
instructions for use. 
Furthermore, readability 
testing of the PFP Package 
Leaflet was satisfactorily 
completed in 2007 and 
further readability testing 
is currently being 
conducted. The outcome of 
this latest round of testing 
will be used to determine 
the need for updates to 
the instructions for use 
section of the leaflet. In 
addition, a highly visual 
teaching guide was 
developed to facilitate HCP 
training of patients in the 
clinician’s office. This 
teaching guide has been 
made available to support 
clinicians in their training 
of patients. 
•  Availability of a needle 
free demonstration device. 
This device allows patients 
to practice injections prior 
to using the actual PFP.

2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated (addition, deletion). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
4.1 Therapeutic indications 
[…] 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective 
signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Enbrel treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric 
plaque psoriasis. Patients treated with Enbrel should be given the Patient Alert Card.  
Posology 
[…] 
Psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis and non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
The recommended dose is 25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly, or 50 mg administered once 
weekly.   
For all of the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response is usually 
achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered 
in a patient not responding within this time period. 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
This section presents data from four randomised controlled trials in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, 
one study in adults with psoriatic arthritis, one study in adults with ankylosing spondylitis, one study 
in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, four studies in adults with plaque 
psoriasis, three studies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one study in paediatric patients with plaque 
psoriasis.

Adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
The efficacy of Enbrel in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpa) 
was assessed in a randomised, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study 
evaluated 215 adult patients (modified intent-to-treat population) with active nr-AxSpa (18 
to 49 years of age), defined as those patients meeting the ASAS classification criteria of 
axial spondyloarthritis but did not meet the modified New York criteria for AS. Patients were 
also required to have an inadequate response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. In the 
double-blind period, patients received Enbrel 50 mg weekly or placebo for 12 weeks. The 
primary measure of efficacy (ASAS 40) was a 40% improvement in at least three of the four 
ASAS domains and absence of deterioration in the remaining domain. MRIs of the sacroiliac 
joint and spine were obtained to assess inflammation at baseline and at week 12. The 
double-blind period was followed by an open-label period during which all patients receive 
Enbrel 50 mg weekly for up to an additional 92 weeks.  
Compared to placebo, treatment with Enbrel resulted in statistically significant improvement 
in the ASAS 40, ASAS 20 and ASAS 5/6. Significant improvement was also observed for the 
ASAS partial remission and BASDAI 50. Week 12 results are shown in the table below.

At week 12, there was a statistically significant improvement in the SPARCC 
(Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada) score for the sacroiliac joint as 
measured by MRI for patients receiving Enbrel. Adjusted mean change from baseline was 
3.8 for Enbrel treated (n=95) versus 0.8 for placebo treated (n=105) patients (p<0.001). 
Enbrel showed statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 12 
compared to placebo in most health-related quality of life and physical function 
assessments, including BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), EuroQol 5D 
Overall Health State Score and SF-36 Physical Component Score. 
Clinical responses among nr-AxSpa patients who received Enbrel were apparent at the time 
of the first visit (2 weeks) and were maintained through 24 weeks of therapy.

The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to include minor administrative changes in section 4.2 of the 
50 mg SmPC (EU/1/99/126/006-011, 016-021) and in section 2 of the PL (EU/1/99/126/012 and 022) 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
Furthermore, Annex II has been clarified with a reference to the existing healthcare professional 
educational material and the Patient Alert Card. 
No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet (PL) has been performed. As the 
Enbrel PLs have undergone recent user consultations and the changes proposed in this variation are 
deemed not to be substantial, further readability testing is not considered to be required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In a well-designed trial where patients were carefully selected to meet the ASAS criteria of nr-AxSpA, 
etanercept showed convincing evidence of significant anti-inflammatory effects when compared to 
placebo in a population of patients with severe active disease not adequately responding to NSAIDs. 
The results of the primary endpoint are supported by the results of all key secondary endpoints, except 
for mobility measurements, and include: 
•  ASAS 40 (Week 12 - primary endpoint): % difference = 16.6% (95% CI = 5.4, 27.9); p = 0.006 
•  ASAS 20 (Week 12): % difference = 16.3% (95% CI = 3.1, 29.4); p = 0.02 
•  BASDAI 50 (Week 12): % difference = 20.0% (95% CI = 7.5, 32.4); p = 0.003 
The reduction in active inflammatory lesions (bone marrow oedema) detected at MRI appeared 
statistically different from placebo in both the spine and sacroiliac joints: 
•  SPARCC spine (Week 12): adjusted difference of mean = -0.96 (95% CI = -1.88, -0.04); p = 0.04 
•  SPARCC SIJ (Week 12): adjusted difference of mean = -2.93 (95% CI = -4.16, -1.70); p < 0.001 
These data are particularly relevant and provide objective evidence of anti-inflammatory effects at the 
lesion site. It is consistent with the results of the ESTHER trial, which compared the effects of 
etanercept and sulfasalazine in early axial spondyloarthritis on MRI activity (Song, 2011). 
In addition, a number of quality of life instruments were able to differentiate etanercept from placebo 
after 12 weeks of treatment, including BASFI, the EQ-5D VAS score, the SF-36 physical component, 
and even some items of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. 
Etanercept was consistently superior to placebo in most patient subgroups, either statistically or at 
least numerically. Importantly, the effect of etanercept appeared more pronounced when inflammatory 
signs were initially more marked (as reflected by CRP or MRI), which corresponds to the target 
population of patients as defined in the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The need for continuous therapy to maintain clinical response or remission over time is currently 
unknown. As anti-TNFs have not been shown to prevent progression of structural damage while they 
are not devoid of serious risks on the long-term, treatment interruption in stable condition is justified. 
Enbrel 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/43987/2014 
Page 54/57 
 
 
Given that AxSpA is a disease with fluctuating symptomatology and patients with non-radiological 
disease are likely to start anti-TNF treatment early in life, the possibility of treatment interruptions is 
especially relevant.  
Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within 12 weeks of 
treatment (as described in the product information). 
The remaining uncertainty about the optimal conditions of use in the long-term has been addressed in 
the RMP with two studies, the ongoing B1801031 and a study B1801381 to be conducted in a larger 
sample of nr-AxSpA patients to refine the description of the relapse profile after treatment 
discontinuation and evaluate the effects of re-treatment. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
During the double-blind period, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in etanercept-treated patients than 
in placebo-treated patients essentially due to injection site reactions and skin reactions. No difference 
in the occurrence of infections was found and the incidence of SAEs was similar. Liver enzymes 
(ALT/AST) abnormalities were slightly more frequent, but usually transient. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No new safety concern emerged during this trial over a 24-week period. The safety profile of 
etanercept in the target population is consistent with its known safety profile in AS. No additional 
uncertainty in the current knowledge of the risks of etanercept has been identified. The MAH agreed to 
conduct a study in nr-AxSpA patients to evaluate the duration of remission after withdrawal of therapy 
as well as safety of treatment after disease flare (as described in the RMP). The information obtained 
from the proposed study B1801381 will be complemented by the results from the current ongoing 
study B1801031, which will provide an assessment of the long-term safety associated with continuous 
etanercept treatment (up to 104 weeks) in this population (as described in the RMP).  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The beneficial effects of etanercept in the target population have been demonstrated with a range of 
standard composite scores used in AS, which assess the main symptoms of the disease (in particular 
back pain and morning stiffness), functional limitation, and disease activity. These have been 
supported by significant reduction in systemic and local signs of inflammation. A positive impact of the 
treatment on the patient quality of life and work has also been shown. These changes are clinically 
relevant. They represent at Week 12 an improvement from baseline of about 35% with respect to 
symptoms and functional limitation as evaluated by the patient and about 45% with respect to 
objective inflammatory signs (CRP, MRI).  
The unfavourable effects of etanercept are well known given the extensive experience accumulated 
over 15 years and for most manageable. For a majority of patients, the safety profile of etanercept is 
acceptable with generally self-limiting injection site reactions.  
Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within 12 weeks of 
treatment (as described in the product information). The remaining uncertainty about the optimal 
conditions of use in the long-term has been addressed in the RMP with two studies, the ongoing 
Enbrel

re-treatment.

If left untreated, a sizeable proportion of patients with sacroiliac inflammation on MRI but who lack 
radiographic findings are expected to progress to the more debilitating state of AS although it is 
currently unknown what proportion of patients with nr-AxSpA will progress to AS. It may take years 
from the onset of inflammatory back pain symptoms until the appearance of radiographic sacroiliitis 
and there are no established criteria to identify patients who are likely to progress. Nevertheless, the 
burden of disease on patients can be equally severe in the presence or absence of radiographic 
sacroiliitis. 
NSAIDs are currently recommended as first-line therapy in patients with AxSpA, including those with 
nr-AxSpA. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine 
are sometimes used but have demonstrated minimal efficacy in treating AxSpA. Thus, there is a 
medical need for patients with nr-AxSpA whose disease is not responsive to NSAIDs. Two anti-TNF 
monoclonal antibodies, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol, have been approved in the EU for the 
treatment of adults with nr-AxSpA. 
Currently, most studies of anti-TNFs have failed to show an impact on structural progression in AS. 
Therefore, early therapeutic intervention may potentially impact the natural history of the disease 
progression by reducing early inflammation, as this may be the forerunner of irreversible bony 
ankylosis. 
The benefit provided by symptomatic improvement and its positive impact on quality of life and work, 
in addition to the potential of delaying or preventing progression to debilitating AS, is considered to 
exceed the rare serious risks of etanercept. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit-risk balance of etanercept in the treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated CRP and/or MRI 
evidence, who have had an inadequate response to NSAIDs, is considered positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
 The application for the treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is approvable since 
other concerns have all been resolved. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type

and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. The package leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to include minor administrative changes in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC of the 50 mg formulation. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet.

Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch in each Member State, the MAH shall agree the final educational material with the 
competent authority in that Member State comprising of information provided to  all healthcare 
professionals expected to prescribe the product on the correct and safe use of the pre-filled pen and a 
Patient Alert Card which is to be given to patients using Enbrel. 
The healthcare professional’s educational material should contain the following key elements: 
Teaching guide to facilitate training of the patients in the safe use of the pre-filled pen 
• 
•  A needle-free demonstration device 
• 
Instructional materials to share with patients 
The Patient’s Alert Card should contain the following key elements for patients treated with Enbrel: 
• 
• 
The risk of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis (TB)  
The risk of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

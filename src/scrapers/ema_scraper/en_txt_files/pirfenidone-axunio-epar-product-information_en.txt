CLINICAL  PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pirfenidone axunio is indicated in adults for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Pirfenidone axunio should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of  IPF. 
Posology 
Adults 
Upon initiating treatment, the dose should be titrated to the recommended daily dose of 2403 mg/day 
over a 14-day period as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Days 1 to 7: a dose of 267 mg administered three times a day  (801 mg/day) 
Days 8 to 14: a dose of 534 mg administered three times a day (1602 mg/day) 
Day 15 onward: a dose of 801 mg administered three times a day (2403  mg/day) 
The recommended maintenance daily dose of Pirfenidone axunio is 801 mg three times a day with 
food for a total of 2403 mg/day. 
Doses above 2403 mg/day are not recommended for any patient (see section 4.9).

Patients who miss 14 consecutive days or more of pirfenidone treatment should re-initiate therapy by 
undergoing the initial 2-week titration regimen up to the recommended daily dose. 
For treatment interruption of less than 14 consecutive days, the dose can be resumed at the previous 
recommended daily dose without titration. 
Dose adjustments and other considerations for safe use 
Gastrointestinal events 
In patients who experience intolerance to therapy due to gastrointestinal undesirable effects, patients 
should be reminded to take the medicinal product with food. If symptoms persist, the dose of pirfenidone 
may be reduced to 267 mg – 534 mg, two to three times a day with food with re-escalation to the 
recommended daily dose as tolerated. If symptoms continue, patients may be instructed to interrupt 
treatment for one to two weeks to allow symptoms to resolve. 
Photosensitivity reaction or rash 
Patients who experience a mild to moderate photosensitivity reaction or rash should be reminded to use a 
sunblock daily and to avoid exposure to the sun (see section 4.4). The dose of pirfenidone may be 
reduced to 801 mg each day (267 mg three times a day). If the rash persists after 7 days, pirfenidone 
should be discontinued for 15 days, with re-escalation to the recommended daily dose in the same 
manner as the dose escalation period. 
Patients who experience severe photosensitivity reaction or rash should be instructed to interrupt the 
dose and to seek medical advice (see section 4.4). Once the rash has resolved, pirfenidone may be re-
introduced and re-escalated up to the recommended daily dose at the discretion of the physician. 
Hepatic function 
In the event of significant elevation of alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferases (ALT/AST) with or 
without bilirubin elevation, the dose of pirfenidone should be adjusted or treatment discontinued 
according to the guidelines listed in section 4.4. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients of 65 years and older (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh 
Class A and B). However, since plasma levels of pirfenidone may be increased in some individuals with 
mild to moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be used with pirfenidone treatment in this 
population. Pirfenidone therapy should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment or end 
stage liver disease (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and  5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment. Pirfenidone should be used with 
caution in patients with moderate (CrCl 30-50 ml/min) renal impairment. Pirfenidone therapy should not 
be used in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring 
dialysis (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of pirfenidone in the paediatric population for the indication of IPF. 
Method of administration 
Pirfenidone axunio is for oral use. The tablets are to be swallowed whole with water and taken with 
food to reduce the possibility of nausea and dizziness (see sections 4.8 and 5.2).

4.3  Contraindications 
•  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
•  History of angioedema with pirfenidone (see section 4.4). 
• 
Concomitant use of fluvoxamine (see section  4.5). 
• 
Severe hepatic impairment or end stage liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
• 
Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatic function 
Elevated transaminases have been commonly reported in patients treated with pirfenidone. Liver 
function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) should be performed prior to the initiation of treatment with 
pirfenidone, and subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months and then every 3 months 
thereafter (see section 4.8). 
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation >3 to <5 x ULN without bilirubin elevation and 
without symptoms or signs of drug-induced liver injury after starting pirfenidone therapy, other causes 
should be excluded, and the patient monitored closely. Discontinuation of other medicines associated 
with liver toxicity should be considered. If clinically appropriate, the dose of pirfenidone should be 
reduced or interrupted. Once liver function tests are within normal limits pirfenidone may be re-
escalated to the recommended daily dose if tolerated. 
Drug-induced liver injury 
Uncommonly,  elevations  in  AST  and  ALT  were  associated  with  concomitant  bilirubin  increases. 
Cases  of  severe  drug-induced  liver  injury,  including  isolated  cases  with  fatal  outcome,  have  been 
reported post-marketing (see section 4.8). 
In addition to the recommended regular monitoring of liver function tests, prompt clinical evaluation 
and measurement of liver function tests should be performed in patients who report symptoms that 
may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or 
jaundice. 
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation >3 to <5 x ULN accompanied by 
hyperbilirubinaemia or clinical signs or symptoms indicative of liver injury, pirfenidone should be 
permanently discontinued and the patient should not be rechallenged. 
If a patient exhibits an aminotransferase elevation to ≥5 x ULN, pirfenidone should be permanently 
discontinued and the patient should not be rechallenged. 
Hepatic impairment 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh Class B), pirfenidone exposure was 
increased by 60%. Pirfenidone should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh Class A and B) given the potential for increased 
pirfenidone exposure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity especially if they are 
concomitantly taking a known CYP1A2 inhibitor (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). Pirfenidone has not been 
studied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment and pirfenidone must not be used in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Photosensitivity reaction and rash 
Exposure to direct sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimised during treatment with 
pirfenidone. Patients should be instructed to use a sunblock daily, to wear clothing that protects against 
sun exposure, and to avoid other medicinal products known to cause photosensitivity. Patients should be 
instructed to report symptoms of photosensitivity reaction or rash to their physician. Severe 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
photosensitivity reactions are uncommon. Dose adjustments or temporary treatment discontinuation may 
be necessary in mild to severe cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash (see section 4.2). 
Severe skin reactions 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening 
or fatal, have been reported post-marketing in association with pirfenidone treatment. If signs and 
symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, Pirfenidone axunio should be withdrawn immediately. 
If the patient has developed SJS or TEN with the use of pirfenidone, treatment with Pirfenidone 
axunio must not be restarted and should be permanently discontinued. 
Angioedema/anaphylaxis 
Reports of angioedema (some serious) such as swelling of the face, lips and/or tongue which may be 
associated with difficulty breathing or wheezing have been received in association with use of 
pirfenidone in the post-marketing setting. Reports of anaphylactic reactions have also been received. 
Therefore, patients who develop signs or symptoms of angioedema or severe allergic reactions 
following administration of pirfenidone should immediately discontinue treatment. Patients with 
angioedema or severe allergic reactions should be managed according to standard of care. Pirfenidone 
must not be used in patients with a history of angioedema or hypersensitivity due to pirfenidone (see 
section 4.3). 
Dizziness 
Dizziness has been reported in patients taking pirfenidone. Therefore, patients should know how they 
react to this medicinal product before they engage in activities requiring mental alertness or 
coordination (see section 4.7). In clinical studies, most patients who experienced dizziness had a single 
event, and most events resolved, with a median duration of 22 days. If dizziness does not improve or if it 
worsens in severity, dose adjustment or even discontinuation of pirfenidone may be warranted. 
Fatigue 
Fatigue has been reported in patients taking pirfenidone. Therefore, patients should know how they 
react to this medicinal product before they engage in activities requiring mental alertness or 
coordination (see section 4.7). 
Weight loss 
Weight loss has been reported in patients treated with pirfenidone (see section 4.8). Physicians should 
monitor patient’s weight, and when appropriate encourage increased caloric intake if weight loss is 
considered to be of clinical significance. 
Hyponatraemia 
Hyponatraemia has been reported in patients treated with pirfenidone (see section 4.8). As the 
symptoms of hyponatraemia may be subtle and masked by the presence of concomitant morbidities, 
regular monitoring of the relevant laboratory parameters is recommended, especially in the presence of 
evocative signs and symptoms such as nausea, headache or dizziness. 
Excipients with known effect 
This medicinal  product  contains less  than  1 mmol sodium  (23 mg)  per  film-coated tablet,  that is to 
say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Pirfenidone axunio 534 mg film-coated tablets 
This medicinal product contains azo colouring agents which may cause allergic reactions.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Approximately 70–80% of pirfenidone is metabolised via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from other 
CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. 
Consumption of grapefruit juice is associated with inhibition of CYP1A2 and should be avoided 
during treatment with pirfenidone. 
Fluvoxamine and inhibitors of CYP1A2 
In a Phase 1 study, the co-administration of pirfenidone and fluvoxamine (a strong inhibitor of 
CYP1A2 with inhibitory effects on other CYP isoenzymes [CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6]) resulted in a 4-
fold increase in exposure to pirfenidone in non-smokers. 
Pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of fluvoxamine (see section 4.3). 
Fluvoxamine should be discontinued prior to the initiation of pirfenidone therapy and avoided during 
pirfenidone therapy due to the reduced clearance of pirfenidone. Other therapies that are inhibitors of 
both CYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (e.g. 
CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) should be avoided during pirfenidone treatment. 
In vitro and in vivo extrapolations indicate that strong and selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. 
enoxacin) have the potential to increase the exposure to pirfenidone by approximately 2 to 4-fold. If 
concomitant use of pirfenidone with a strong and selective inhibitor of CYP1A2 cannot be avoided, the 
dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 801 mg daily (267 mg, three times a day). Patients should be 
closely monitored for emergence of adverse reactions associated with pirfenidone therapy. Discontinue 
pirfenidone if necessary (see sections 4.2 and  4.4). 
Co-administration of pirfenidone and 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) 
increased the exposure to pirfenidone by 81%. If ciprofloxacin at the dose of 750 mg two times a day 
cannot be avoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 1602 mg daily (534 mg, three times a 
day). Pirfenidone should be used with caution when ciprofloxacin is used at a dose of 250 mg or 
500 mg once or two times a day. 
Pirfenidone should be used with caution in patients treated with other moderate inhibitors of CYP1A2 
(e.g. amiodarone, propafenone). 
Special care should also be exercised if CYP1A2 inhibitors are being used concomitantly with potent 
inhibitors of one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone such as 
CYP2C9 (e.g. amiodarone, fluconazole), 2C19 (e.g. chloramphenicol) and 2D6 (e.g. fluoxetine, 
paroxetine). 
Cigarette smoking and inducers of CYP1A2 
A Phase 1 interaction study evaluated the effect of cigarette smoking (CYP1A2 inducer) on the 
pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. The exposure to pirfenidone in smokers was 50% of that observed in 
non-smokers. Smoking has the potential to induce hepatic enzyme production and thus increase 
medicinal product clearance and decrease exposure. Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 
including smoking should be avoided during pirfenidone therapy based on the observed relationship 
between cigarette smoking and its potential to induce CYP1A2. Patients should be encouraged to 
discontinue use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 and to stop smoking before and during treatment with 
pirfenidone. 
In the case of moderate inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g. omeprazole), concomitant use may theoretically 
result in a lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels. 
Co-administration of medicinal products that act as potent inducers of both CYP1A2 and the other 
CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (e.g. rifampicin) may result in significant 
lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels. These medicinal products should be avoided whenever 
possible.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of pirfenidone in pregnant women. 
In animals placental transfer of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites occurs with the potential for 
accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in amniotic fluid. 
At high doses (≥1,000 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited prolongation of gestation and reduction in foetal 
viability. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of pirfenidone during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pirfenidone or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk 
with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A 
risk to the breastfed infant cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from pirfenidone 
therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of pirfenidone 
therapy for the mother. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects on fertility were observed in preclinical studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pirfenidone may cause dizziness and fatigue, which could have a moderate influence on the ability to 
drive or use machines, therefore patients should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery 
if they experience these symptoms. 
4.8  Undesirable  effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical study experience with pirfenidone at a 
dose of 2,403 mg/day compared to placebo, respectively, were nausea (32.4% versus 12.2%), rash 
(26.2% versus 7.7%), diarrhoea (18.8% versus 14.4%), fatigue (18.5% versus 10.4%), dyspepsia  (16.1% 
versus 5.0%), decreased appetite (20.7% versus 8%), headache (10.1% versus 7.7%), and 
photosensitivity reaction (9.3% versus 1.1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of pirfenidone has been evaluated in clinical studies including 1,650 volunteers and 
patients. More than 170 patients have been investigated in open studies for more than five years and 
some for up to 10 years. 
Table 1 shows the adverse reactions reported at a frequency of ≥2% in 623 patients receiving 
pirfenidone at the recommended dose of 2,403 mg/day in three pooled pivotal Phase 3 studies. Adverse 
reactions from post-marketing experience are also listed in Table 1. Adverse reactions are listed by 
System Organ Class (SOC) and within each frequency grouping [Very common (≥1/10), common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), not known (cannot 
be estimated from the available data)] the adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing

1 Identified through post-marketing surveillance 
2 Cases of severe drug-induced liver injury, including reports with fatal outcome have been identified 
through post-marketing surveillance (see sections 4.3, 4.4). 
Exposure-adjusted analyses of pooled clinical trials in IPF confirmed that the safety and 
tolerability profile of pirfenidone in IPF patients with advanced disease (n=366) is consistent 
with that established in IPF patients with non-advanced disease (n=942). 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Decreased appetite  
During the pivotal clinical trials, cases of decreased appetite were readily manageable and 
generally not associated with significant sequelae. Uncommonly, cases of decreased appetite 
were associated with significant weight loss and required medical intervention. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited clinical experience with overdose. Multiple doses of pirfenidone up to a total 
dose of 4,806 mg/day were administered as six 267 mg capsules three times daily to healthy 
adult volunteers over a 12-day dose escalation period. Adverse reactions were mild, transient, 
and consistent with the most frequently reported adverse reactions for pirfenidone. 
In the event of a suspected overdose, supportive medical care should be provided including 
monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the clinical status of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, other immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AX05 
The mechanism of action of pirfenidone has not been fully established. However, existing data 
suggest that pirfenidone exerts both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of in 
vitro systems and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis (bleomycin- and transplant-induced 
fibrosis). 
IPF is a chronic fibrotic and inflammatory pulmonary disease affected by the synthesis and 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and 
interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) and pirfenidone has been shown to reduce the accumulation of 
inflammatory cells in response to various stimuli. 
Pirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation, production of fibrosis-associated proteins and 
cytokines, and the increased biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to 
cytokine growth factors such as, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and platelet-derived 
growth factor (PDGF). 
Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of pirfenidone has been studied in four Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with IPF. Three of the Phase 3 studies 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016) were multinational, and one (SP3) was conducted in Japan. 
PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 compared treatment with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day to placebo. The 
studies were nearly identical in design, with few exceptions including an intermediate dose 
group (1,197 mg/day) in PIPF-004. In both studies, treatment was administered three times daily 
for a minimum of 72 weeks. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from Baseline 
to Week 72 in percent predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). In the combined PIPF-004 and 
PIPF-006 population treated with the dose of 2,403 mg/d comprising in total 692 patients, the 
median baseline percent predicted FVC values were 73.9% in the pirfenidone group and 72.0% 
in the placebo group (range: 50-123% and 48-138%, respectively), and the median baseline 
percent predicted Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLco) 45.1% in the pirfenidone group 
and 45.6% in the placebo group (range: 25-81% and 21-94%, respectively). In PIPF-004, 2.4% 
in the pirfenidone group and 2.1% in the placebo group had percent predicted FVC below 50% 
and/or percent predicted DLco below 35% at Baseline. In PIPF-006, 1.0% in the pirfenidone 
group and 1.4% in the placebo group had percent predicted FVC below 50% and/or percent 
predicted DLco below 35% at Baseline. 
In study PIPF-004, the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 72 of treatment 
was significantly reduced in patients receiving pirfenidone (N=174) compared with patients 
receiving placebo (N=174; p=0.001, rank ANCOVA). Treatment with pirfenidone also 
significantly reduced the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 24 
(p=0.014), 36 (p<0.001), 48 (p<0.001), and 60 (p<0.001). At Week 72, a decline from baseline 
in percent predicted FVC of ≥10% (a threshold indicative of the risk of mortality in IPF) was 
seen in 20% of patients receiving pirfenidone compared to 35% receiving placebo (Table 2).

Although there was no difference between patients receiving pirfenidone compared to placebo in 
change from Baseline to Week 72 of distance walked during a six minute walk test (6MWT) by 
the prespecified rank ANCOVA, in an ad hoc analysis, 37% of patients receiving pirfenidone 
showed a decline of ≥50 m in 6MWT distance, compared to 47% of patients receiving placebo 
in PIPF-004. 
In study PIPF-006, treatment with pirfenidone (N=171) did not reduce the decline of percent 
predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 72 compared with placebo (N=173; p=0.501). However, 
treatment with pirfenidone reduced the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at 
Weeks 24 (p<0.001), 36 (p=0.011), and 48 (p=0.005). At Week 72, a decline in FVC of ≥10% 
was seen in 23% of patients receiving pirfenidone and 27% receiving placebo (Table 3).

to 47% of patients receiving placebo in PIPF-006. 
In a pooled analysis of survival in PIPF-004 and PIPF-006 the mortality rate with pirfenidone 
2403 mg/day group was 7.8% compared with 9.8% with placebo (HR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.47–
1.28]). 
PIPF-016 compared treatment with pirfenidone 2,403 mg/day to placebo. Treatment was 
administered three times daily for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from 
Baseline to Week 52 in percent predicted FVC. In a total of 555 patients, the median baseline 
percent predicted FVC and %DLCO were 68% (range: 48–91%) and 42% (range: 27–170%), 
respectively. Two percent of patients had percent predicted FVC below 50% and 21% of patients 
had a percent predicted DLCO below 35% at Baseline. 
In study PIPF-016, the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Week 52 of treatment 
was significantly reduced in patients receiving pirfenidone (N=278) compared with patients 
receiving placebo (N=277; p<0.000001, rank ANCOVA). Treatment with pirfenidone also 
significantly reduced the decline of percent predicted FVC from Baseline at Weeks 13 
(p<0.000001), 26 (p<0.000001), and 39 (p=0.000002). At Week 52, a decline from Baseline in 
percent predicted FVC of ≥10% or death was seen in 17% of patients receiving pirfenidone 
compared to  32% receiving placebo (Table 4).

The decline in distance walked during a 6MWT from Baseline to Week 52 was significantly 
reduced in patients receiving pirfenidone compared with patients receiving placebo in PIPF-016 
(p=0.036, rank ANCOVA); 26% of patients receiving pirfenidone showed a decline of ≥50 m in 
6MWT distance compared to 36% of patients receiving placebo. 
In a pre-specified pooled analysis of studies PIPF-016, PIPF-004, and PIPF-006 at Month 12, 
all-cause mortality was significantly lower in pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group (3.5%, 22 of 623 
patients) compared with placebo (6.7%, 42 of 624 patients), resulting in a 48% reduction in the 
risk of all-cause mortality within the first 12 months (HR 0.52 [95% CI, 0.31–0.87], p=0.0107, 
log-rank test). 
The study (SP3) in Japanese patients compared pirfenidone 1800 mg/day (comparable to 
2403 mg/day in the US and European populations of PIPF-004/006 on a weight-normalised basis) 
with placebo (N=110, N=109, respectively). Treatment with pirfenidone significantly reduced 
mean decline in vital capacity (VC) at Week 52 (the primary endpoint) compared with placebo  
(-0.09±0.02 l versus -0.16±0.02 l respectively, p=0.042). 
IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment 
In pooled post-hoc analyses of studies PIPF-004, PIPF-006 and PIPF-016, in the population of 
advanced IPF (n = 170) with FVC < 50% at baseline and/or DLco < 35% at baseline, the annual 
decline of FVC in patients receiving pirfenidone (n=90) compared with patients receiving 
placebo (n=80) was -150.9 mL and -277.6 mL, respectively. 
In MA29957, a supportive 52-week Phase IIb, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial in IPF patients with advanced lung function impairment (DLco < 40% of 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
predicted) and at high risk of grade 3 pulmonary hypertension, 89 patients treated with 
pirfenidone monotherapy had a similar decline in FVC as pirfenidone-treated patients in the 
post-hoc analysis of the pooled phase 3 trials PIPF-004, PIPF-006, and PIPF-016. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pirfenidone in all subsets of the paediatric population in IPF (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Administration of pirfenidone capsules with food results in a large reduction in Cmax (by 50%) 
and a smaller effect on AUC, compared to the fasted state. Following oral administration of a 
single dose of 801 mg to healthy older adult volunteers (50-66 years of age) in the fed state, the 
rate of pirfenidone absorption slowed, while the AUC in the fed state was approximately 80-
85% of the AUC observed in the fasted state. Bioequivalence was demonstrated in the fasted 
state when comparing the 801 mg tablet to three 267 mg capsules. In the fed state, the 801 mg 
tablet met bioequivalence criteria based on the AUC measurements compared to the capsules, 
while the 90% confidence intervals for Cmax (108.26% - 125.60%) slightly exceeded the upper 
bound of standard bioequivalence limit (90% CI: 80.00% - 125.00%). The effect of food on 
pirfenidone oral AUC was consistent between the tablet and capsule formulations. Compared to 
the fasted state, administration of either formulation with food reduced pirfenidone Cmax, with 
pirfenidone tablet reducing the Cmax slightly less (by 40%) than pirfenidone capsules (by 50%). 
A reduced incidence of adverse events (nausea and dizziness) was observed in fed subjects when 
compared to the fasted group. Therefore, it is recommended that pirfenidone is administered 
with food to reduce the incidence of nausea and dizziness. 
The absolute bioavailability of pirfenidone has not been determined in humans. 
Distribution 
Pirfenidone binds to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin. The overall mean 
binding ranged from 50% to 58% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (1 to 100 μg/ml). 
Mean apparent oral steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 70 l, indicating that 
pirfenidone distribution to tissues is modest. 
Biotransformation 
Approximately 70–80% of pirfenidone is metabolised via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from 
other CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. In vitro data indicate some 
pharmacologically relevant activity of the major metabolite (5-carboxy-pirfenidone) at 
concentrations in excess of peak plasma concentrations in IPF patients.  This may become 
clinically relevant in patients with moderate renal impairment where plasma exposure to 5-
carboxy-pirfenidone is increased. 
Elimination 
The oral clearance of pirfenidone appears modestly saturable. In a multiple-dose, dose-ranging 
study in healthy older adults administered doses ranging from 267 mg to 1,335 mg three times a 
day, the mean clearance decreased by approximately 25% above a dose of 801 mg three times a 
day. Following single dose administration of pirfenidone in healthy older adults, the mean apparent 
terminal elimination half-life was approximately 2.4 hours. Approximately 80% of an orally 
administered dose of pirfenidone is cleared in the urine within 24 hours of dosing. The majority of 
pirfenidone is excreted as the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite (>95% of that recovered), with 
less than 1% of pirfenidone excreted unchanged in urine.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were compared 
in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and in subjects with normal 
hepatic function. Results showed that there was a mean increase of 60% in pirfenidone exposure 
after a single dose of 801 mg pirfenidone (3 x 267 mg capsule) in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. 
Pirfenidone should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
and patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity especially if they are 
concomitantly taking a known CYP1A2 inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Pirfenidone is 
contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment and end stage liver disease (see sections 4.2 and 
4.3). 
Renal impairment 
No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone were observed in 
subjects with mild to severe renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal 
function. The parent substance is predominantly metabolised to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone. The 
mean (SD) AUC0-∞ of 5-carboxy-pirfenidone was significantly higher in the moderate (p = 
0.009) and severe (p < 0.0001) renal impairment groups than in the group with normal renal 
function; 100 (26.3) mg•h/L and 168 (67.4) mg•h/L compared to 28.7 (4.99) mg•h/L 
respectively.

Exposure to 5-carboxy-pirfenidone increases 3.5-fold or more in patients with moderate renal 
impairment. Clinically relevant pharmacodynamic activity of the metabolite in patients with 
moderate renal impairment cannot be excluded. No dose adjustment is required in patients with 
mild renal impairment who are receiving pirfenidone. Pirfenidone should be used with caution in 
patients with moderate renal impairment. The use of pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients 
with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min) or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses from 4 studies in healthy subjects or subjects with renal 
impairment and one study in patients with IPF showed no clinically relevant effect of age, 
gender or body size on the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic  potential. 
In repeated dose toxicity studies increases in liver weight were observed in mice, rats and dogs; 
this was often accompanied by hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy. Reversibility was observed after 
cessation of treatment. An increased incidence of liver tumours was observed in carcinogenicity 
studies conducted in rats and mice. These hepatic findings are consistent with an induction of 
hepatic microsomal enzymes, an effect which has not been observed in patients receiving 
pirfenidone. These findings are not considered relevant to  humans. 
A statistically significant increase in uterine tumours was observed in female rats administered 
1,500 mg/kg/day, 37 times the human dose of 2,403 mg/day. The results of mechanistic studies 
indicate that the occurrence of uterine tumours is probably related to a chronic dopamine-mediated 
sex hormone imbalance involving a species-specific endocrine mechanism in the rat which is not 
present in humans. 
Reproductive toxicology studies demonstrated no adverse effects on male and female fertility or 
postnatal development of offspring in rats and there was no evidence of teratogenicity in  rats 
(1,000 mg/kg/day) or rabbits (300 mg/kg/day). In animals placental transfer of pirfenidone 
and/or its metabolites occurs with the potential for accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its 
metabolites in amniotic fluid. At high doses (≥450 mg/kg/day) rats exhibited a prolongation of 
oestrous cycle and a high incidence of irregular cycles. At high doses (≥1,000 mg/kg/day) rats 
exhibited a prolongation of gestation and reduction in fetal viability. Studies in lactating rats 
indicate that pirfenidone and/or its metabolites are excreted in milk with the potential for 
accumulation of pirfenidone and/or its metabolites in milk. 
Pirfenidone showed no indication of mutagenic or genotoxic activity in a standard battery of 
tests and when tested under UV exposure was not mutagenic. When tested under UV exposure 
pirfenidone was positive in a photoclastogenic assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. 
Phototoxicity and irritation were noted in guinea pigs after oral administration of pirfenidone 
and with exposure to UVA/UVB light. The severity of phototoxic lesions was minimised by 
application of sunscreen.

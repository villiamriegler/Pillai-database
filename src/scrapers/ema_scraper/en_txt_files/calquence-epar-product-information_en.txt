CYP3A 
inhibitors
Strong CYP3A inhibitor
If these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as 
anti-infectives for up to seven days), interrupt Calquence.
Moderate CYP3A 
inhibitor
No dose adjustment. Monitor patients closely for adverse 
reactions if taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
Mild CYP3A inhibitor
No dose adjustment.
CYP3A 
inducers
Strong CYP3A inducer
Avoid concomitant use.
3
Proton pump inhibitors
Avoid concomitant use.
H2-receptor antagonists
Take Calquence 2 hours before (or 10 hours after) taking 
a H2-receptor antagonist. 
Antacids
The interval between taking the medicinal products 
should be at least 2 hours. 
Gastric 
acid 
reducing 
agents
Missed dose
If a patient misses a dose of Calquence by more than 3 hours, the patient should be instructed to take the 
next dose at its regularly scheduled time. Double dose of Calquence should not be taken to make up for a 
missed dose.
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment were treated in Calquence clinical studies. No dose adjustment is needed for 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance). Hydration 
should be maintained, and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. Calquence should be 
administered to patients with severe renal impairment (< 30mL/min creatinine clearance) only if the 
benefit outweighs the risk and these patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity. There are 
no data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, 
Child-Pugh B, or total bilirubin between 1.5-3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST). 
However, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity. It 
is not recommended to use Calquence in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C or total 
bilirubin >3-times ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2).
Severe cardiac disease
Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from Calquence clinical studies. 
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Calquence in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available.
4
Method of administration 
Calquence is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water at approximately the same 
time each day, with or without food (see section 4.5). The capsules should not be chewed, dissolved or 
opened as this may affect the absorption of the medicinal product into the body.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Haemorrhage
Major haemorrhagic events including central nervous system and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, some with 
fatal outcome, have occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence 
monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. These events have occurred in patients both with 
and without thrombocytopenia. Overall, the bleeding events were less severe events including bruising 
and petechiae (see section 4.8).
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. 
Patients receiving antithrombotic agents may be at increased risk of haemorrhage. Use caution with 
antithrombotic agents and consider additional monitoring for signs of bleeding when concomitant use is 
medically necessary. Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly 
with Calquence. 
Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Calquence for at least 3 days pre- and post-surgery.
Infections
Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events have occurred in patients with 
haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. 
These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, with neutropenic 
infection reported in 1.9% of all patients. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpes zoster virus 
(HZV) reactivation, aspergillosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred 
(see section 4.8).
Viral reactivation 
Cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients receiving Calquence. Hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) status should be established before initiating treatment with Calquence. If patients have positive 
hepatitis B serology, a liver disease expert should be consulted before the start of treatment and the patient 
should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported 
following the use of Calquence within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening 
neurological, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, then appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment with Calquence should be suspended until 
PML is excluded. If any doubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for 
5
PML including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA 
and repeat neurological assessments should be considered.
Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate.
Cytopenias
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, 
occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in 
combination with obinutuzumab. Monitor complete blood counts as medically indicated (see section 4.8).
Second primary malignancies
Second primary malignancies, including skin and non-skin cancers, occurred in patients with 
haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. 
Skin cancers were commonly reported. Monitor patients for the appearance of skin cancers and advise 
protection from sun exposure (see section 4.8).
Atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence 
monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. Monitor for symptoms (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, 
syncope, chest pain, dyspnoea) of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and obtain an ECG as medically 
indicated (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy with Calquence, 
a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be undertaken. In patients at high 
risk for thromboembolic disease, tightly controlled treatment with anticoagulants and alternative treatment 
options to Calquence should be considered.
Other medicinal products
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Calquence may lead to increased acalabrutinib 
exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of CYP3A 
inducers may lead to decreased acalabrutinib exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. 
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If these inhibitors will be used short-
term (such as anti-infectives for up to seven days), treatment with Calquence should be interrupted. 
Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is used (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.5). Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to risk for 
lack of efficacy.
Calquence contains sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 
(CYP3A4), and both substances are substrates for P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).
6
Active substances that may increase acalabrutinib plasma concentrations
CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor (200 mg itraconazole once daily for 5 days) 
increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 3.9-fold and 5.0-fold in healthy subjects (N=17), respectively.
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors should be avoided. If the strong CYP3A/P-gp 
inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, conivaptan, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ritonavir, telaprevir, 
posaconazole, voriconazole) will be used short-term, treatment with Calquence should be interrupted (see 
section 4.2).
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (400 mg fluconazole as single dose or 200 mg 
isavuconazole as repeated dose for 5 days) in healthy subjects increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 
1.4-fold to 2-fold while the active metabolite ACP-5862 Cmax and AUC was decreased by 0.65-fold to 
0.88-fold relative to when acalabrutinib was dosed alone. No dose adjustment is required in combination 
with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions (see Section 4.2).
Active substances that may decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations
CYP3A inducers
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampicin once daily for 9 days) decreased 
acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 68% and 77% in healthy subjects (N=24), respectively.
Concomitant use with strong inducers of CYP3A activity (e.g., phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine) 
should be avoided. Concomitant treatment with St. John’s wort, which may unpredictably decrease 
acalabrutinib plasma concentrations, should be avoided. 
Gastric acid reducing medicinal products
Acalabrutinib solubility decreases with increasing pH. Co-administration of acalabrutinib with an antacid 
(1 g calcium carbonate) decreased acalabrutinib AUC by 53% in healthy subjects. Co-administration with 
a proton pump inhibitor (40 mg omeprazole for 5 days) decreased acalabrutinib AUC by 43%.
If treatment with an acid reducing agent is required, consider using an antacid (e.g., calcium carbonate), or 
an H2-receptor antagonist (e.g., ranitidine or famotidine). For use with antacids, the interval between 
taking the medicinal productshould be at least 2 hours (see section 4.2). For H2-receptor antagonists, take 
Calquence should be taken 2 hours before (or 10 hours after) taking the H2-receptor antagonist.
Due to the long-lasting effect of proton pump inhibitors, separation of doses with proton pump inhibitors 
may not eliminate the interaction with Calquence and therefore concomitant use should be avoided (see 
section 4.2).
Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by Calquence
CYP3A substrates
Based on in vitro data, it cannot be excluded that acalabrutinib is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at the intestinal 
level and may increase the exposure of CYP3A4 substrates sensitive to gut CYP3A metabolism. Caution 
7
should be exercised if co-administering acalabrutinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic 
range administered orally (e.g., cyclosporine, ergotamine, pimozide). 
Effect of acalabrutinib on CYP1A2 substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib induces CYP1A2. Co-administration of acalabrutinib with
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) may decrease their exposure.
Effects of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, on medicinal product transport systems
Acalabrutinib may increase exposure to co-administered BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate) by 
inhibition of intestinal BCRP (see section 5.2). To minimise the potential for an interaction in the 
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, oral narrow therapeutic range BCRP substrates such as methotrexate should be 
taken at least 6 hours before or after acalabrutinib.
ACP-5862 may increase exposure to co-administered MATE1 substrates (e.g., metformin) by inhibition of 
MATE1 (see section 5.2). Patients taking concomitant medicinal products with disposition dependent 
upon MATE1 (e.g., metformin) should be monitored for signs of changed tolerability as a result of 
increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving Calquence.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
Calquence. 
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of acalabrutinib in pregnant women. Based on 
findings from animal studies, there may be a risk to the foetus from exposure to acalabrutinib during 
pregnancy. Dystocia (difficult or prolonged labour) was observed in the rat and administration to pregnant 
rabbits was associated with reduced foetal growth (see section 5.3).
Calquence should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with acalabrutinib.   
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether acalabrutinib is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effect of 
acalabrutinib on the breast-fed child or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were 
present in the milk of lactating rats. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding 
mothers are advised not to breast-feed during treatment with Calquence and for 2 days after receiving the 
last dose.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of Calquence on human fertility. In a non-clinical study of acalabrutinib in 
male and female rats, no adverse effects on fertility parameters were observed (see section 5.3).
8
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Calquence has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, during 
treatment with acalabrutinib, fatigue and dizziness have been reported and patients who experience these 
symptoms should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.
4.8 Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions
Discontinuation and dose reduction due to adverse reactions
Of the 1,040 patients treated with Calquence monotherapy, discontinuation due to adverse reactions were 
reported in 9.3% of the patients. These main adverse reactions included pneumonia, thrombocytopenia 
and diarrhoea. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were reported in 4.2% of patients. These main 
adverse reactions included hepatitis B reactivation, sepsis, and diarrhoea. 
Of the 223 patients treated with Calquence combination, discontinuation due to adverse reactions were 
reported in 10.8% of the patients. These main adverse reactions included pneumonia, thrombocytopenia 
and diarrhoea. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were reported in 6.7% of patients. These main 
adverse reactions included neutropenia, diarrhoea and vomiting.
Elderly
Of the 1,040 patients in clinical studies of Calquence monotherapy, 41% were greater than 65 years and 
less than 75 years of age and 22% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in 
safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.
Of the 223 patients in clinical studies of Calquence in combination of obinutuzumab therapy, 47% were 
greater than 65 years and less than 75 years of age and 26% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically 
relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients and ≥ 65 years and younger.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific treatment for acalabrutinib overdose and symptoms of overdose have not been 
established. In the event of an overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EL02.
Mechanism of action
Acalabrutinib is a selective inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a signalling molecule of the 
B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in B-cell 
survival and proliferation, and is required for cellular adhesion, trafficking, and chemotaxis.
Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the 
BTK active site, leading to irreversible inactivation of BTK with minimal off-target interactions.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In patients with B-cell malignancies dosed with acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily, median steady-state 
BTK occupancy of ≥ 95% in peripheral blood was maintained over 12 hours, resulting in inactivation of 
BTK throughout the recommended dosing interval.
Cardiac electrophysiology
The effect of acalabrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 46 healthy male and female subjects in a 
randomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic 
dose, 4-times the maximum recommended dose, Calquence did not prolong the QT/QTc interval to any 
clinically relevant extent (e.g., not greater than or equal to 10 ms) (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.3).
Clinical efficacy and safety
Patients with previously untreated CLL
The safety and efficacy of Calquence in previously untreated CLL were evaluated in a randomised, 
multi-centre, open-label Phase 3 study (ELEVATE-TN) of 535 patients. Patients received Calquence plus 
obinutuzumab, Calquence monotherapy, or obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Patients 65 years of age or 
older, or between 18 and 65 years of age with coexisting medical conditions, were included in 
ELEVATE-TN, 27.9% patients had a CrCl of < 60 mL/min. Of the patients who were < 65 years of age, 
16.1% had a median CIRS-G score of 8. The study allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents. 
Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms to receive 

Calquence plus obinutuzumab (Calquence+G): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily 
starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Obinutuzumab was 
administered starting on Cycle 2 Day 1 for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 
1,000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of 
Cycle 2 followed by 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 3 up to 7. Each cycle was 28 days.  
Calquence monotherapy: Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity.
Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GClb): Obinutuzumab and chlorambucil were administered for a 
maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 1,000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 
(100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 followed by 1,000 mg on Day 1 of

Cycles 2 up to 6. Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg was administered on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 up to 6. 
Each cycle was 28 days.
Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance 
status (0 or 1 versus 2) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus Other). After 
confirmed disease progression, 45 patients randomised on the GClb arm crossed over to Calquence 
monotherapy. Table 5 summarises the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the study

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) of Calquence+G arm versus GClb arm as 
assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) per International Workshop on Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-
related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 28.3 months, PFS by IRC indicated a 
90% statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for previously untreated 
CLL patients in the Calquence+G arm compared to the GClb arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table

PFS results for Calquence with or without obinutuzumab were consistent across subgroups, including high 
risk features. In the high risk CLL population (17p deletion, 11q deletion, TP53 mutation or unmutated 
IGHV), the PFS HRs of Calquence with or without obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil 
was 0.08 [95% CI (0.04, 0.15)] and 0.13 [95% CI (0.08, 0.21)], respectively.

With long term data, the median follow-up was 58.2 months for Calquence+G arm, 58.1 months for 
Calquence arm and 58.2 months for the GClb arm. The median investigator assessed PFS for 
Calquence+G and Calquence monotherapy was not reached; and was 27.8 months in GClb arm. At the 
time of most recent data cut off, a total of 72 patients (40.7%) originally randomised to the GClb arm 
crossed over to Calquence monotherapy. The median overall survival had not been reached in any arm 
with a total of 76 deaths: 18 (10.1%) in the Calquence+G arm, 30 (16.8%) in the Calquence monotherapy 
arm, and 28 (15.8%) in the GClb arm.

Patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy
The safety and efficacy of Calquence in relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluated in a randomised, 
multi-centre, open-label phase 3 study (ASCEND) of 310 patients who received at least one prior therapy 
not including BCL-2 inhibitors or B-cell receptor inhibitors. Patients received Calquence monotherapy or 
investigator’s choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab. The study allowed 
18
 
 
 
patients to receive antithrombotic agents. Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or 
equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either:


Calquence 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or
Investigator’s choice:
o Idelalisib 150 mg twice daily in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of 
the first cycle, followed by 500 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks for 4 doses, then every 4 weeks 
for 3 doses for a total of 8 infusions
o Bendamustine 70 mg/m2 (Day 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle) in combination with 
rituximab (375 mg/m2/500 mg/m2) on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles
Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance 
status (0 or 1 versus 2) and number of prior therapies (1 to 3 versus ≥ 4). After confirmed disease 
progression, 35 patients randomised on investigator’s choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or 
bendamustine plus rituximab crossed over to Calquence. Table 9 summarizes the baseline demographics

Investigator assessed PFS results at final analysis for Calquence were consistent across subgroups, 
including high risk features and were consistent with the primary analysis.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Calquence in all subsets of the paediatric population in CLL (for information on paediatric use, see section 
4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, were studied in healthy 
subjects and in patients with B-cell malignancies. Acalabrutinib exhibits dose-proportionality, and both 
acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 exhibit almost linear PK across a dose range of 75 to 250 mg. Population PK 
modelling suggests that the PK of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 is similar across patients with different B-
cell malignancies. At the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with B-cell malignancies 
(including, CLL), the geometric mean steady state daily area under the plasma concentration over time 
curve (AUC24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for acalabrutinib were 1679 ng•h/mL and 
438 ng/mL, respectively, and for ACP-5862 were 4166 ng•h/mL and 446 ng/mL, respectively.
Absorption
The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 0.5-1.5 hours for acalabrutinib, and 1.0 hour for ACP-
5862. The absolute bioavailability of Calquence was 25%.
23
 
 
Effect of food on acalabrutinib
In healthy subjects, administration of a single 75 mg dose of acalabrutinib with a high fat, high calorie 
meal (approximately 918 calories, 59 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 39 grams protein) did not 
affect the mean AUC as compared to dosing under fasted conditions. Resulting Cmax decreased by 69% 
and Tmax was delayed 1-2 hours.
Distribution
Reversible binding to human plasma protein was 99.4% for acalabrutinib and 98.8% for ACP-5862. The 
in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.8 for acalabrutinib and 0.7 for ACP-5862. The mean steady 
state volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 34 L for acalabrutinib.
Biotransformation/Metabolism
In vitro, acalabrutinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, and to a minor extent by 
glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis. ACP-5862 was identified as the major metabolite in 
plasma, that was further metabolized primarily by CYP3A-mediated oxidation, with a geometric mean 
exposure (AUC) that was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than the exposure of acalabrutinib. ACP-5862 
is approximately 50% less potent than acalabrutinib with regard to BTK inhibition.
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect 
clearance of substrates of these CYPs.
In vitro studies indicate that ACP-5862 does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is 
unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs.
Interactions with transport proteins
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 are P-gp and BCRP substrates. Co-
administration with BCRP inhibitors is however unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions. 
Co-administration with an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor (600 mg rifampin, single dose) resulted in an increase 
in acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold (N=24, healthy subjects), respectively, which is 
not clinically relevant. 
Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 do not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Acalabrutinib may inhibit intestinal BCRP, while ACP-
5862 may inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). Acalabrutinib does not 
inhibit MATE1, while ACP-5862 does not inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations.
Elimination
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib, the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 
acalabrutinib was 1 to 2 hours. The  t1/2 of the active metabolite, ACP-5862, was approximately 7 hours.
The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 134 L/hr for acalabrutinib and 22 L/hr for ACP-5862 in 
patients with B-cell malignancies.
24
Following administration of a single 100 mg radiolabelled [14C]-acalabrutinib dose in healthy subjects, 
84% of the dose was recovered in the faeces and 12% of the dose was recovered in the urine, with less 
than 2% of the dose excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib.
Special populations
Based on population PK analysis, age (>18 years of age), sex, race (Caucasian, African American) and 
body weight did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of acalabrutinib and its active 
metabolite, ACP-5862.
Paediatric population
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with Calquence in patients under 18 years of age.
Renal Impairment 
Acalabrutinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. A pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal 
impairment has not been conducted. 
Based on population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK difference was observed in 408 subjects with 
mild renal impairment (eGFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by MDRD), 109 subjects 
with moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2) relative to 192  subjects with 
normal renal function (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73m2). The pharmacokinetics of 
acalabrutinib has not been characterised in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 
29 mL/min/1.73m2) or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with creatinine levels greater than 2.5 
times the institutional ULN were not included in the clinical studies (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment 
Acalabrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In dedicated hepatic impairment (HI) studies, compared to 
subjects with normal liver function (n=6), acalabrutinib exposure (AUC) was increased by 1.9-fold, 1.5-
fold and 5.3-fold in subjects with mild (n=6) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (n=6) (Child-Pugh B) and severe 
(n=8) (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively. Subjects in the moderate HI group were however 
not significantly affected in markers relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs, so the effect of 
moderate hepatic impairment was likely underestimated in this study. Based on a population PK analysis, 
no clinically relevant difference was observed between subjects with mild (n=79) or moderate (n=6) 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5- to 3-times ULN and any AST) relative to subjects with 
normal (n=613) hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN) (see section 4.2).
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib.
Genotoxicity/Mutagenicity/Phototoxicity
Acalabrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in an in vitro chromosome 
aberration assay or in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.
Based on phototoxicity assays using 3T3 cell line in vitro, acalabrutinib is considered to have a low risk 
for phototoxicity in humans.
25
Repeat-dose toxicity
In rats, microscopic findings of minimal to mild severity were observed in the pancreas 
(haemorrhage/pigment/inflammation/fibrosis in islets) at all dose levels. Non-adverse findings of minimal 
to mild severity in the kidneys (tubular basophilia, tubular regeneration, and inflammation) were observed 
in studies of up to 6-month duration with a No Observed Adverse Effect level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day 
in  rats. The mean exposures (AUC) at the NOAEL in male and female rats correspond to 0.6x and 1x, 
respectively, the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily, respectively. The 
Lowest Adverse Observed Effect Level (LOAEL) at which reversible renal (moderate tubular 
degeneration) and liver (individual hepatocyte necrosis) findings were observed in the chronic rat study 
was 100 mg/kg/day and provided an exposure margin 4.2-times greater than the clinical exposure at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In studies of 9 months duration in dogs, the NOAEL was 
10 mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure 3-times the clinical AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
Minimal tubular degeneration in kidney, slight decreases in spleen weights and transient minimal to mild 
decreases in red cell mass and increases in ALT and ALP were observed at 30 mg/kg/day (9-times the 
clinical AUC) in dogs. Cardiac toxicities in rats (myocardial haemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis) and 
dogs (perivascular/vascular inflammation) were observed only in animals that died during studies at doses 
above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The exposures in rats and dogs with cardiac findings was at 
least 6.8-times and 25-times the clinical AUC, respectively. Reversibility for the heart findings could not 
be assessed as these findings were only observed at doses above the MTD.
Reproductive toxicology
No effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats at exposures 10- or 9-times the clinical  AUC  
at the recommended dose, respectively.
No effects on embryofoetal development and survival were observed in pregnant rats, at exposures 
approximately 9-times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In two rat 
reproductive studies, dystocia (prolonged/difficult labour) was observed at exposures >2.3-times the 
clinical exposure at 100 mg twice daily. The presence of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were 
confirmed in foetal rat plasma. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating 
rats.
In an embryofoetal study in pregnant rabbits, decreased foetal body weight and delayed ossification were 
observed at exposure levels that produced maternal toxicity which were 2.4-times greater than the human 
AUC at the recommended dose.

Acalabrutinib tablets can be co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, 
H2-receptor antagonists, antacids), unlike acalabrutinib capsules which show impaired uptake when given 
with acid reducing agents (see section 4.5).
Missed dose
If a patient misses a dose of Calquence by more than 3 hours, the patient should be instructed to take the 
next dose at its regularly scheduled time. Double dose of Calquence should not be taken to make up for a 
missed dose.
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment were treated in Calquence clinical studies. No dose adjustment is needed for 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance). Hydration 
should be maintained, and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. Calquence should be 
administered to patients with severe renal impairment (< 30mL/min creatinine clearance) only if the 
benefit outweighs the risk and these patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity. There are 
no data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, 
Child-Pugh B, or total bilirubin between 1.5-3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST). 
However, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity. It 
is not recommended to use Calquence in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C or total 
bilirubin >3-times ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2).
Severe cardiac disease
Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from Calquence clinical studies. 
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Calquence in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration 
Calquence is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water at approximately the same 
time each day, with or without food (see section 4.5). The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, 
dissolved or divided.
4.3 Contraindications
31
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Haemorrhage
Major haemorrhagic events including central nervous system and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, some with 
fatal outcome, have occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence
monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. These events have occurred in patients both with 
and without thrombocytopenia. Overall, the bleeding events were less severe events including bruising 
and petechiae (see section 4.8).
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. 
Patients receiving antithrombotic agents may be at increased risk of haemorrhage. Use caution with 
antithrombotic agents and consider additional monitoring for signs of bleeding when concomitant use is 
medically necessary. Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly 
with Calquence. 
Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Calquence for at least 3 days pre- and post-surgery.
Infections
Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events have occurred in patients with 
haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab.
These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, with neutropenic 
infection reported in 1.9% of all patients. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpes zoster virus 
(HZV) reactivation, aspergillosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred
(see section 4.8).
Viral reactivation 
Cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients receiving Calquence. Hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) status should be established before initiating treatment with Calquence. If patients have positive 
hepatitis B serology, a liver disease expert should be consulted before the start of treatment and the patient 
should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported 
following the use of Calquence within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. 
Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening 
neurological, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, then appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment with Calquence should be suspended until 
PML is excluded. If any doubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for 
PML including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA 
and repeat neurological assessments should be considered.
Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate.
32
Cytopenias
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, 
occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in 
combination with obinutuzumab. Monitor complete blood counts as medically indicated (see section 4.8).
Second primary malignancies
Second primary malignancies, including skin and non-skin cancers, occurred in patients with 
haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. 
Skin cancers were commonly reported. Monitor patients for the appearance of skin cancers and advise 
protection from sun exposure (see section 4.8).
Atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence
monotherapy and in combination with obinutuzumab. Monitor for symptoms (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, 
syncope, chest pain, dyspnoea) of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and obtain an ECG as medically 
indicated (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy with Calquence, 
a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be undertaken. In patients at high 
risk for thromboembolic disease, tightly controlled treatment with anticoagulants and alternative treatment 
options to Calquence should be considered.
Other medicinal products
Co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Calquence may lead to increased acalabrutinib 
exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of CYP3A 
inducers may lead to decreased acalabrutinib exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. 
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If these inhibitors will be used short-
term (such as anti-infectives for up to seven days), treatment with Calquence should be interrupted.
Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is used (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.5). Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to risk for 
lack of efficacy.
Calquence contains sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 
(CYP3A4), and both substances are substrates for P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).
33
Active substances that may increase acalabrutinib plasma concentrations
CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor (200 mg itraconazole once daily for 5 days) 
increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 3.9-fold and 5.0-fold in healthy subjects (N=17), respectively.
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors should be avoided. If the strong CYP3A/P-gp 
inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, conivaptan, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ritonavir, telaprevir, 
posaconazole, voriconazole) will be used short-term, treatment with Calquence should be interrupted (see 
section 4.2).
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (400 mg fluconazole as single dose or 200 mg 
isavuconazole as repeated dose for 5 days) in healthy subjects increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 
1.4-fold to 2-fold while the active metabolite ACP-5862 Cmax and AUC was decreased by 0.65-fold to 
0.88-fold relative to when acalabrutinib was dosed alone. No dose adjustment is required in combination 
with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions (see Section 4.2).
Active substances that may decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations
CYP3A inducers
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampicin once daily for 9 days) decreased 
acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 68% and 77% in healthy subjects (N=24), respectively.
Concomitant use with strong inducers of CYP3A activity (e.g., phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine)
should be avoided. Concomitant treatment with St. John’s wort, which may unpredictably decrease 
acalabrutinib plasma concentrations, should be avoided. 
Gastric acid reducing medicinal products
No clinically significant differences in acalabrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when a 100 mg 
acalabrutinib tablet was used concomitantly with a proton pump inhibitor (rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily 
for 3 days). Acalabrutinib tablets can be co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump 
inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids), unlike aclabrutinib capsules which show impaired uptake 
when given with acid reducing agents.
Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by Calquence
CYP3A substrates
Based on in vitro data, it cannot be excluded that acalabrutinib is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at the intestinal 
level and may increase the exposure of CYP3A4 substrates sensitive to gut CYP3A metabolism. Caution 
should be exercised if co-administering acalabrutinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic 
range administered orally (e.g., cyclosporine, ergotamine, pimozide).
Effect of acalabrutinib on CYP1A2 substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib induces CYP1A2. Co-administration of acalabrutinib with
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) may decrease their exposure.
34
Effects of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, on medicinal product transport systems
Acalabrutinib may increase exposure to co-administered BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate) by 
inhibition of intestinal BCRP (see section 5.2). To minimise the potential for an interaction in the 
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, oral narrow therapeutic range BCRP substrates such as methotrexate should be 
taken at least 6 hours before or after acalabrutinib.
ACP-5862 may increase exposure to co-administered MATE1 substrates (e.g., metformin) by inhibition of 
MATE1 (see section 5.2). Patients taking concomitant medicinal products with disposition dependent 
upon MATE1 (e.g., metformin) should be monitored for signs of changed tolerability as a result of 
increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving Calquence.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
Calquence. 
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of acalabrutinib in pregnant women. Based on 
findings from animal studies, there may be a risk to the foetus from exposure to acalabrutinib during 
pregnancy. Dystocia (difficult or prolonged labour) was observed in the rat and administration to pregnant 
rabbits was associated with reduced foetal growth (see section 5.3).
Calquence should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with acalabrutinib.   
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether acalabrutinib is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effect of 
acalabrutinib on the breast-fed child or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were 
present in the milk of lactating rats. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding 
mothers are advised not to breast-feed during treatment with Calquence and for 2 days after receiving the 
last dose.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of Calquence on human fertility. In a non-clinical study of acalabrutinib in 
male and female rats, no adverse effects on fertility parameters were observed (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Calquence has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, during 
treatment with acalabrutinib, fatigue and dizziness have been reported and patients who experience these 
symptoms should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been identified in clinical studies with patients 
receiving Calquence as treatment for haematological malignancies. The median duration of Calquence
treatment across the pooled dataset was 26.2 months.
Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ class (SOC) in MedDRA. Within each system 
organ class, the adverse drug reactions are sorted by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In 
addition, the corresponding frequency category for each ADR is defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (> 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare 
(< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, 
adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Discontinuation and dose reduction due to adverse reactions
Of the 1,040 patients treated with Calquence monotherapy, discontinuation due to adverse reactions were 
reported in 9.3% of the patients. These main adverse reactions included pneumonia, thrombocytopenia 
and diarrhoea. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were reported in 4.2% of patients. These main 
adverse reactions included hepatitis B reactivation, sepsis, and diarrhoea. 
Of the 223 patients treated with Calquence combination, discontinuation due to adverse reactions were 
reported in 10.8% of the patients. These main adverse reactions included pneumonia, thrombocytopenia 
and diarrhoea. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were reported in 6.7% of patients. These main 
adverse reactions included neutropenia, diarrhoea and vomiting.
Elderly
Of the 1,040 patients in clinical studies of Calquence monotherapy, 41% were greater than 65 years and 
less than 75 years of age and 22% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in 
safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.
Of the 223 patients in clinical studies of Calquence in combination of obinutuzumab therapy, 47% were 
greater than 65 years and less than 75 years of age and 26% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically 
relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients and ≥ 65 years and younger.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific treatment for acalabrutinib overdose and symptoms of overdose have not been 
established. In the event of an overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EL02.
Mechanism of action
Acalabrutinib is a selective inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a signalling molecule of the 
B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in B-cell 
survival and proliferation, and is required for cellular adhesion, trafficking, and chemotaxis.
Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the 
BTK active site, leading to irreversible inactivation of BTK with minimal off-target interactions.
Pharmacodynamic effects
In patients with B-cell malignancies dosed with acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily, median steady-state 
BTK occupancy of ≥ 95% in peripheral blood was maintained over 12 hours, resulting in inactivation of 
BTK throughout the recommended dosing interval.
Cardiac electrophysiology
The effect of acalabrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 46 healthy male and female subjects in a 
randomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic 
dose, 4-times the maximum recommended dose, Calquence did not prolong the QT/QTc interval to any 
clinically relevant extent (e.g., not greater than or equal to 10 ms) (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.3).
Clinical efficacy and safety
Patients with previously untreated CLL
The safety and efficacy of Calquence in previously untreated CLL were evaluated in a randomised, 
multi-centre, open-label Phase 3 study (ELEVATE-TN) of 535 patients. Patients received Calquence plus 
obinutuzumab, Calquence monotherapy, or obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Patients 65 years of age or 
older, or between 18 and 65 years of age with coexisting medical conditions, were included in 
ELEVATE-TN, 27.9% patients had a CrCl of < 60 mL/min. Of the patients who were < 65 years of age, 
16.1% had a median CIRS-G score of 8. The study allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents. 
Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms to receive 

Calquence plus obinutuzumab (Calquence+G): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily 
starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Obinutuzumab was 
administered starting on Cycle 2 Day 1 for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 
1,000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of 
Cycle 2 followed by 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 3 up to 7. Each cycle was 28 days.  
Calquence monotherapy: Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily until disease progression
or unacceptable toxicity.
Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GClb): Obinutuzumab and chlorambucil were administered for a 
maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 1,000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 
(100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 followed by 1,000 mg on Day 1 of



Cycles 2 up to 6. Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg was administered on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 up to 6. 
Each cycle was 28 days.
Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance 
status (0 or 1 versus 2) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus Other). After 
confirmed disease progression, 45 patients randomised on the GClb arm crossed over to Calquence
monotherapy. Table 5 summarises the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the study 
population.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) of Calquence+G arm versus GClb arm as 
assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) per International Workshop on Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-
related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 28.3 months, PFS by IRC indicated a 
90% statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for previously untreated 
CLL patients in the Calquence+G arm compared to the GClb arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table

PFS results for Calquence with or without obinutuzumab were consistent across subgroups, including high 
risk features. In the high risk CLL population (17p deletion, 11q deletion, TP53 mutation or unmutated 
IGHV), the PFS HRs of Calquence with or without obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil 
was 0.08 [95% CI (0.04, 0.15)] and 0.13 [95% CI (0.08, 0.21)], respectively.

With long term data, the median follow-up was 58.2 months for Calquence+G arm, 58.1 months for 
Calquence arm and 58.2 months for the GClb arm. The median investigator assessed PFS for 
Calquence+G and Calquence monotherapy was not reached; and was 27.8 months in GClb arm. At the 
time of most recent data cut off, a total of 72 patients (40.7%) originally randomised to the GClb arm 
crossed over to Calquence monotherapy. The median overall survival had not been reached in any arm 
with a total of 76 deaths: 18 (10.1%) in the Calquence+G arm, 30 (16.8%) in the Calquence monotherapy 
arm, and 28 (15.8%) in the GClb arm.

Patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy
The safety and efficacy of Calquence in relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluated in a randomised, 
multi-centre, open-label phase 3 study (ASCEND) of 310 patients who received at least one prior therapy
not including BCL-2 inhibitors or B-cell receptor inhibitors. Patients received Calquence monotherapy or 
investigator’s choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab. The study allowed 
45
 
 
 
patients to receive antithrombotic agents. Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or 
equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either:


Calquence 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or
Investigator’s choice:
o Idelalisib 150 mg twice daily in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of 
the first cycle, followed by 500 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks for 4 doses, then every 4 weeks 
for 3 doses for a total of 8 infusions
o Bendamustine 70 mg/m2 (Day 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle) in combination with 
rituximab (375 mg/m2/500 mg/m2) on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles
Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance 
status (0 or 1 versus 2) and number of prior therapies (1 to 3 versus ≥ 4). After confirmed disease 
progression, 35 patients randomised on investigator’s choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or 
bendamustine plus rituximab crossed over to Calquence. Table 9 summarizes the baseline demographics 
and disease characteristics of the study population.

The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by IRC IWCLL 2008 criteria with incorporation of the 
clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 16.1months,
PFS indicated a 69% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression for patients in the 
Calquence arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 10. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in 
Figure 2.

Time from randomization (months)
Investigator assessed PFS results at final analysis for Calquence were consistent across subgroups, 
including high risk features and were consistent with the primary analysis.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Calquence in all subsets of the paediatric population in CLL (for information on paediatric use, see section 
4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, were studied in healthy 
subjects and in patients with B-cell malignancies. Acalabrutinib exhibits dose-proportionality, and both 
acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 exhibit almost linear PK across a dose range of 75 to 250 mg. Population PK 
modelling suggests that the PK of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 is similar across patients with different B-
cell malignancies. At the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with B-cell malignancies 
(including, CLL), the geometric mean steady state daily area under the plasma concentration over time 
curve (AUC24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for acalabrutinib were 1679 ng•h/mL and 
438 ng/mL, respectively, and for ACP-5862 were 4166 ng•h/mL and 446 ng/mL, respectively.
Calquence tablets and Calquence capsules have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent. Calquence tablets 
contain acalabrutinib maleate, a salt form of acalabrutinib that shows higher solubility at high pH than the 
acalabrutinib base, which is the active content of Calquence capsules. Calquence tablets thus have a better 
absorption when combined with acid reducing agents.
50
 
 
Absorption
The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 0.2-3.0 hours for acalabrutinib, and 0.5-4.0 hours for 
ACP-5862. The absolute bioavailability of Calquence was 25%.
Effect of food on acalabrutinib
In healthy subjects, administration of a single 100 mg dose of acalabrutinib tablet with a high fat, high 
calorie meal (approximately 918 calories, 59 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 39 grams protein) did 
not affect the mean AUC as compared to dosing under fasted conditions. Resulting Cmax decreased by 54% 
and Tmax was delayed 1-2 hours.
Distribution
Reversible binding to human plasma protein was 99.4% for acalabrutinib and 98.8% for ACP-5862. The 
in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.8 for acalabrutinib and 0.7 for ACP-5862. The mean steady 
state volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 34 L for acalabrutinib.
Biotransformation/Metabolism
In vitro, acalabrutinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, and to a minor extent by 
glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis. ACP-5862 was identified as the major metabolite in 
plasma, that was further metabolized primarily by CYP3A-mediated oxidation, with a geometric mean 
exposure (AUC) that was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than the exposure of acalabrutinib. ACP-5862 
is approximately 50% less potent than acalabrutinib with regard to BTK inhibition.
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect 
clearance of substrates of these CYPs.
In vitro studies indicate that ACP-5862 does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is 
unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs.
Interactions with transport proteins
In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 are P-gp and BCRP substrates. Co-
administration with BCRP inhibitors is however unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions.
Co-administration with an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor (600 mg rifampin, single dose) resulted in an increase 
in acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold (N=24, healthy subjects), respectively, which is 
not clinically relevant. 
Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 do not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and 
MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Acalabrutinib may inhibit intestinal BCRP, while ACP-
5862 may inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). Acalabrutinib does not 
inhibit MATE1, while ACP-5862 does not inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations.
51
Elimination
Following a single oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib tablet, the geometric mean terminal elimination half-
life (t1/2) of acalabrutinib was 1.4 hours. The t1/2 of the active metabolite, ACP-5862, was 6.6 hours.
The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 134 L/hr for acalabrutinib and 22 L/hr for ACP-5862 in 
patients with B-cell malignancies.
Following administration of a single 100 mg radiolabelled [14C]-acalabrutinib dose in healthy subjects, 
84% of the dose was recovered in the faeces and 12% of the dose was recovered in the urine, with less 
than 2% of the dose excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib.
Special populations
Based on population PK analysis, age (>18 years of age), sex, race (Caucasian, African American) and 
body weight did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of acalabrutinib and its active 
metabolite, ACP-5862.
Paediatric population
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with Calquence in patients under 18 years of age.
Renal Impairment 
Acalabrutinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. A pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal 
impairment has not been conducted. 
Based on population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK difference was observed in 408 subjects with 
mild renal impairment (eGFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73m2 as estimated by MDRD), 109 subjects
with moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2) relative to 192 subjects with 
normal renal function (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73m2). The pharmacokinetics of 
acalabrutinib has not been characterised in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 
29 mL/min/1.73m2) or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with creatinine levels greater than 2.5-
times the institutional ULN were not included in the clinical studies (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment 
Acalabrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In dedicated hepatic impairment (HI) studies, compared to 
subjects with normal liver function (n=6), acalabrutinib exposure (AUC) was increased by 1.9-fold, 1.5-
fold and 5.3-fold in subjects with mild (n=6) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (n=6) (Child-Pugh B) and severe 
(n=8) (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively. Subjects in the moderate HI group were however 
not significantly affected in markers relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs, so the effect of 
moderate hepatic impairment was likely underestimated in this study. Based on a population PK analysis, 
no clinically relevant difference was observed between subjects with mild (n=79) or moderate (n=6) 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5- to 3-times ULN and any AST) relative to subjects with 
normal (n=613) hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN) (see section 4.2).
52
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib.
Genotoxicity/Mutagenicity/Phototoxicity
Acalabrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in an in vitro chromosome 
aberration assay or in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.
Based on phototoxicity assays using 3T3 cell line in vitro, acalabrutinib is considered to have a low risk 
for phototoxicity in humans.
Repeat-dose toxicity
In rats, microscopic findings of minimal to mild severity were observed in the pancreas 
(haemorrhage/pigment/inflammation/fibrosis in islets) at all dose levels. Non-adverse findings of minimal 
to mild severity in the kidneys (tubular basophilia, tubular regeneration, and inflammation) were observed 
in studies of up to 6-month duration with a No Observed Adverse Effect level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day 
in  rats. The mean exposures (AUC) at the NOAEL in male and female rats correspond to 0.6x and 1x, 
respectively, the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily, respectively. The 
Lowest Adverse Observed Effect Level (LOAEL) at which reversible renal (moderate tubular 
degeneration) and liver (individual hepatocyte necrosis) findings were observed in the chronic rat study 
was 100 mg/kg/day and provided an exposure margin 4.2-times greater than the clinical exposure at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In studies of 9 months duration in dogs, the NOAEL was 10 
mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure 3-times the clinical AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
Minimal tubular degeneration in kidney, slight decreases in spleen weights and transient minimal to mild 
decreases in red cell mass and increases in ALT and ALP were observed at 30 mg/kg/day (9-times the 
clinical AUC) in dogs. Cardiac toxicities in rats (myocardial haemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis) and 
dogs (perivascular/vascular inflammation) were observed only in animals that died during studies at doses 
above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The exposures in rats and dogs with cardiac findings was at 
least 6.8-times and 25-times the clinical AUC, respectively. Reversibility for the heart findings could not 
be assessed as these findings were only observed at doses above the MTD.
Reproductive toxicology
No effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats at exposures 10- or 9-times the clinical  AUC  
at the recommended dose, respectively.
No effects on embryofoetal development and survival were observed in pregnant rats, at exposures
approximately 9-times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In two rat 
reproductive studies, dystocia (prolonged/difficult labour) was observed at exposures >2.3-times the 
clinical exposure at 100mg twice daily. The presence of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were 
confirmed in foetal rat plasma. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating 
rats.
In an embryofoetal study in pregnant rabbits, decreased foetal body weight and delayed ossification were 
observed at exposure levels that produced maternal toxicity which were 2.4-times greater than the human 
AUC at the recommended dose.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Calquence is and what it is used for
What Calquence is
Calquence is a medicine used to treat cancer. 
 Calquence contains the active substance acalabrutinib.
 It belongs to a group of medicines called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.
What Calquence is used for
Calquence is used to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
CLL is a cancer of white blood cells called B-lymphocytes (or B-cells). These cells are part of the immune 
system (the body’s defences).
How Calquence works
Calquence works by blocking BTK, a protein in the body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. 
By blocking BTK, Calquence helps to kill and can reduce the number of cancer cells which can slow 
down the worsening of the disease. 
If you have any questions about how Calquence works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
67

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Bronchitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an 
add-on therapy to best standard of care. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Initiation dose assessment 
Before commencing treatment with Bronchitol all patients should be assessed for bronchial 
hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol during administration of their initiation dose (see sections 4.4 
and 5.1). 
The patient’s initiation dose of Bronchitol must be used under the supervision and monitoring of an 
experienced physician or another health care professional appropriately trained and equipped to 
perform spirometry, monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2), and manage acute bronchospasm (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8) including appropriate use of resuscitation equipment. 
The patient should be pre-medicated with a bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to the initiation dose but 
after the baseline FEV1 and SpO2 (Oxygen saturation in the blood) measurement. All FEV1 
measurements and SpO2 monitoring should be performed 60 seconds after dose inhalation. 
Training the patient to practice correct inhaler technique during the initiation dose assessment is 
important. 
The initiation dose assessment must be performed according to the following steps: 
Step 1: Patients baseline FEV1 and SpO2 is measured prior to the initiation dose 
Step 2: Patient inhales 40 mg (1x40 mg capsules) and SpO2 is monitored 
Step 3: Patient inhales 80 mg (2x40 mg capsules) and SpO2 is monitored 
Step 4: Patient inhales 120 mg (3x40 mg capsules), FEV1 is measured and SpO2 is monitored 
Step 5: Patient inhales 160 mg (4x40 mg capsules), FEV1 is measured and SpO2 is monitored 
Step 6: Patients FEV1 is measured 15 minutes post initiation dose.

Patients with asthma may experience reversible temporary mild bronchospasm after passing the 
initiation dose assessment and therefore all patients should be monitored until their FEV1 has returned 
to baseline levels. 
Therapeutic dose regimen 
The therapeutic dose regimen should not be prescribed until the initiation dose assessment has been 
performed. The patient must complete and pass the initiation dose assessment before starting treatment 
with Bronchitol. 
A bronchodilator must be administered 5-15 minutes before each dose of Bronchitol. 
The recommended dose of Bronchitol is 400 mg twice a day. This requires the inhalation of the 
contents of ten capsules via the inhaler device twice a day. 
The doses should be taken morning and night with the evening dose taken 2-3 hours before bedtime. 
For patients receiving several respiratory therapies, the recommended order is: 
1. Bronchodilator   
2. Bronchitol 
3. Physiotherapy/exercise 
4. Dornase alfa (if applicable) 
5. Inhaled antibiotics (if applicable) 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥65 years) 
There are insufficient data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose 
adjustment. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Bronchitol has not formally been studied in patients with impaired renal and hepatic function. 
Available data from studies DPM-CF-301 and 302 suggest that no dose adjustments are required for 
these patient populations. 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years has not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
The safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children aged less than 6 years has not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Bronchitol is for inhalation use, using the inhaler provided in the pack. It must not be administered by 
any other route or using any other inhaler. The capsules must not be swallowed. 
Each of the capsules is loaded into the device separately. The contents of the capsules are inhaled via 
the inhaler device with one or two breaths. After inhalation, each empty capsule is discarded before 
inserting the next capsule into the inhaler device with as little delay as possible between capsules. 
The inhaler device is to be replaced after one week of use. If the inhaler does require cleaning, it must 
be ensured that the device is empty, then it should be washed in warm water and before re-use,the 
inhaler should be allowed to thoroughly air dry. 
Detailed instructions on how to use the inhaler can be found in the patient information leaflet. Patients 
should be advised to carefully read them.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance. 
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol (see section 4.4).  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hyperresponsiveness to mannitol 
Patients must be monitored for bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol during their 
initiation dose assessment before commencing the therapeutic dose regimen of Bronchitol. If the 
patient is unable to perform spirometry or complete the initiation dose assessment, they must not be 
prescribed Bronchitol. Hyperresponsive patients should not be prescribed the therapeutic dose regimen 
of Bronchitol (see section 4.3). The usual precautions regarding bronchial hyperresponsiveness 
monitoring apply (see section 4.2).  
A patient is defined as hyperresponsive to inhaled mannitol and must not be prescribed the therapeutic 
dose regimen if they experience any of the following during the initiation dose assessment: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
≥10% fall from baseline in SpO2 at any point of the assessment; 
FEV1 fall from baseline is ≥20% at 240 mg cumulative dose; 
FEV1 has fallen 20-<50% (from baseline) at the end of the assessment and does not return to 
<20% within 15 minutes; 
FEV1 has fallen ≥50% (from baseline) at the end of the assessment. 
If a therapy induced hyperresponsive reaction is suspected, Bronchitol should be discontinued. 
All patients should be monitored until their FEV1 has returned to baseline levels. 
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of medicinal product and has been reported with Bronchitol 
in clinical studies, even in patients who were not hyperresponsive to the initiation dose of inhaled 
mannitol (see section 4.8). Bronchospasm should be treated with a bronchodilator or as medically 
appropriate. 
If there is evidence of therapy induced bronchospasm, the physician should carefully evaluate whether 
the benefits of continued use of Bronchitol outweigh the risks to the patient. 
All patients should be formally reviewed after approximately six weeks of Bronchitol treatment to 
assess for signs and symptoms suggestive of active substance induced bronchospasm. The initiation 
dose assessment described in section 4.2 should be repeated if uncertainty exists. 
Asthma 
The safety/efficacy of Bronchitol in patients with asthma has not been formally studied. Patients with 
asthma must be carefully monitored for worsening signs and symptoms of asthma after the initiation 
dose of Bronchitol. 
Patients must be advised to report worsening signs and symptoms of asthma during therapeutic use 
to their physician. If there is evidence of therapy induced bronchospasm, the physician should 
carefully evaluate whether the benefits of continued use of Bronchitol outweigh the risks to the 
patient. Bronchospasm should be treated with a bronchodilator or as medically appropriate. 
Haemoptysis 
Haemoptysis has been commonly reported with Bronchitol in clinical studies. Bronchitol has not been 
studied in patients with a history of significant episodes of haemoptysis (>60 ml) in the previous three 
months. As a consequence, these patients should be carefully monitored, and Bronchitol should be 
withheld in the event of massive haemoptysis. A massive/serious haemoptysis is considered to be: 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acute bleeding ≥240 ml in a 24-hour period 
recurrent bleeding ≥100 ml/day over several days  
• 
• 
The reinstitution or withholding of Bronchitol following smaller episodes of haemoptysis should be 
based on clinical judgement. 
Cough 
Cough was  commonly reported with use of Bronchitol in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Patients 
should be trained to practice correct inhaler technique during treatment and advised to report persistent 
cough with the use of Bronchitol to their physician. 
Impaired lung function 
Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients with a FEV1 of less than 30% of predicted 
(see section 5.1). The use of Bronchitol is not recommended in these patients. 
Non-CF Bronchiectasis 
Efficacy and safety have not been established in non-CF bronchiectasis patients. Therefore, treatment 
with Bronchitol is not recommended. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal interaction studies have been conducted. 
However, Bronchitol has been used in clinical studies in conjunction with standard cystic fibrosis 
therapies such as mucolytics, antibiotics (including tobramycin and colistimethate sodium), 
bronchodilators, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, and analgesics. 
There are no data on concomitant use of hypertonic saline with Bronchitol as it was excluded from the 
Phase 3 studies. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of mannitol in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As the effects 
of a possible hyperresponsive reaction on the mother and/or foetus are unknown, caution should be 
exercised when prescribing Bronchitol to pregnant women. As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of Bronchitol during pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether mannitol is excreted in human milk. The excretion of mannitol in milk has not 
been studied in animals. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue Bronchitol therapy taking into account the 
benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of Bronchitol therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
For mannitol no clinical data on fertility is available. Animal reproduction studies have not been 
carried out with inhaled mannitol. However, studies with orally administered mannitol indicate no 
fertility effects (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Bronchitol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of Bronchitol has been evaluated in clinical studies involving more than 
1200 patients. (See Table 1).

Initiation dose assessment 
The most commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol during the 
initiation dose assessment is cough (2.9% of patients), (see section 4.4).  
The most important adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol during the initiation dose 
assessment is bronchospasm (see section 4.4).  
Therapeutic dose regimen 
The most commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol is cough 
(see section 4.4). This was observed in 8.3% of patients compared to 4.0% of patients in the control 
arm. Cough which led to cessation of treatment was also commonly experienced and was observed in 
4.0% of patients in the Bronchitol treatment arm. 
The most important adverse reaction associated with the use of Bronchitol is haemoptysis. The 
proportion of patients who experienced haemoptysis as an adverse reaction was 7.3%, 3.3% and 3.4% 
in the Bronchitol arms for studies 301, 302 and 303 respectively vs. 3.4%, 0% and 5.6% in the control 
arms. The proportion of patients who experienced haemoptysis  including haemoptysis reported during 
exacerbation was 7.0% in the mannitol arm and 7.7% in the control arm (see section 4.4).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile of Bronchitol is based on the safety data from Phase III clinical studies (including 
data from the initiation dose assessment). 
Frequencies are defined as: 
Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 
to <1/1,000); very rare (≥1/100,000 to <1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Susceptible persons may suffer bronchoconstriction in the event of an inhaled overdose. If excessive 
coughing and bronchoconstriction occurs, a beta2 agonist should be given, and oxygen if necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Cough and cold preparations, Mucolytic. ATC code: R05CB16 
Mechanism of action 
Bronchitol is an inhaled hyperosmotic medicinal product. While the exact mechanism of action is 
unknown, inhaled mannitol may change the viscoelastic properties of mucus, increase the hydration 
of the periciliary fluid layer and contribute to increased mucus clearance of the retained secretions 
through mucociliary activity. Productive cough can contribute to sputum clearance.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In the ITT population of an open label dose response study, DPM-CF-202, the mean (SD) percent 
change in FEV1 for the 400 mg dose was 8.75 (SD: 12.4) and -1.569 (SD: 9.0) for 40 mg dose 
(p < 0.0001).  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Three Phase 3, 26-week double blind, randomised, parallel arm, controlled, intervention studies 
(DPM-CF-301,DPM-CF-302 and DPM-CF-303) have been performed in which 324 (DPM-CF-301) 
and 318 (DPM-CF-302) patients aged 6 years and above were randomised in a 3:2 ratio to inhaled 
mannitol 400 mg twice daily or to control (inhaled mannitol 50 mg twice daily). In the third study 
(DPM-CF-303) 423 adult patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to inhaled mannitol 400 mg twice 
daily or to control. Twenty seven (7.1%) out of 378 patients who undertook the mannitol tolerance test 
(MTT) in study 301, 18 (5.3) out of 341 patients in study 302 and 25 out of 486 patients (5.1%) in 
study 303 had a positive  MTT defined as either 1) a fall in FEV1 >20% from baseline at midpoint 
(step 4) or 2) fall from baseline > 20 % at end of test that did not recover to < 20% within 15 minutes 
or 3) who had a fall in FEV1 > 50% from baseline at end of test (step 6) or 4) who had a fall in Sp02 to 
< 89% during the procedure. An additional 2.8% (n=34) of patients from the three studies had 
incomplete MTTs and were not randomised. 
Mean (SD) baseline FEV1 percent predicted in study DPM-CF-301 (safety population, N= 295) was 
62.4 (SD:16.45) and 61.4 (SD:16.13) in the mannitol and control groups, respectively. These figures 
for study DPM-CF-302 (N=305) are as follows: 65.24 (SD:13.90) and 64.35 (SD:15.29). In study 
DPM-CF-303 (N=423) the baseline FEV1 percent predicted was 63.17 (SD: 15.15) and 62.98 
(SD: 13.65).In study DPM-CF-301 64.4 % of the patient population were adults while in study 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DPM-CF-302 this figure was 49.5%. Study DPM-CF-303 was all adult patients. Fifty five % of 
patients were receiving rhDNase in study DPM-CF-301 while in study DPM-CF-302 this number was 
75% and for DPM-CF-303 this was 67.6%. The percentage of patients receiving inhaled antibiotics 
was 55% in study DPM-CF-301, 56% in study DPM-CF-302 and 52% in Study DPM-CF-303. 
Concomitant administration with hypertonic saline was not permitted in these trials.  
The primary pre-specified endpoint i.e. the change from baseline in FEV1 (ml) in the modified ITT 
(mITT) population (n=269, 297 and 423 in studies DPM-CF-301,DPM-CF-302 and DPM-CF-303, 
respectively) compared to control over the 26 weeks period is provided in Table 3 alongside FEV1 
presented as absolute and relative change % predicted.

Note: There were some differences in analysis methods across the 3 studies.  In DPM-CF-303 imputation of 
missing data was performed using a baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) approach whereas no 
imputation was performed in DPM-CF-301 or DPM-CF-302. 
The treatment effect of Bronchitol on FEV1 was less evident in the subgroup of patients who were 
receiving concomitant rhDNase.In rhDNase users in study 301 the relative change in FEV1 % 
predicted from baseline across 26 weeks of treatment was 2.83 (95% CI -0.62, 6.27). For non-users the 
relative change was 4.30 (95% CI 0.53, 8.07). In study 302 the relative change (95% CI) for rhDNase 
users and non-users was 3.21 (-0.61, 7.03) and 4.73 (-1.93, 11.40), respectively. In study 303 the 
relative change (95% CI) for rhDNase users and non-users was 1.30 (-0.91, 3.51) and 4.45 
(0.52, 8.38), respectively. 
Study 303 did not show a superior treatment effect of Bronchitol on FEV1 for female patients, in 
whom the underlying cystic fibrosis disease course may be worse than males for reasons that are not 
fully understood. In female patients, the adjusted mean change in FEV1 was 27ml for Bronchitol and 
44ml for the control arm, suggesting potentially inferior benefit on lung function with Bronchitol 
compared to the control, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.480). 
The number of subjects with at least one protocol defined pulmonary exacerbation (PDPE, defined by 
the presence of at least 4 symptoms and signs plus the use of intravenous antibiotics) was 18.1% in the 
mannitol arm and 28% in the control arm in study 301 (ITT population).  In study 302 15.2% subjects

in the mannitol arm and 19% in the control had a PDPE. In study 303 13.4% subjects in the mannitol 
arm and 13.6% in the control had a PDPE.  
The estimated effect of treatment (mean change and 95% CI from baseline over 26 weeks, mITT 
population) on FVC was 108.78 ml (95% CI: 49.21, 168.35) in study 301 and 71.4 ml (95% CI: 10.57, 
132.13) in study 302 and 40 ml (95% CI: -12, 92) in study 303. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not been 
established (see section 4.2). 
In studies DPM-CF-301 and 302 relative % predicted FEV1 compared to control in children 
(6-11 years) was improved by 0.44% (95% CI -5.90, 6.77, N=43) and 6.1% (95% CI -1.28, 13.54, 
N=59) over 26 weeks (p=0.892 and 0.104) respectively.  
In adolescents (12-17 years) relative change in % predicted FEV1 compared to control improved by 
3.31% (95% CI -2.29, 8.90, N=55) and 0.42% (95% CI -5.45, 6.29, N=94) over 26 weeks (p=0.245 
and 0.888) respectively.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
In a study of 18 healthy male adult volunteers, the absolute bioavailability of mannitol powder for 
inhalation by comparison to mannitol administered intravenously was 0.59% ± 0.15. 
The rate and extent of absorption of mannitol after inhaled administration was very similar to that 
observed after oral administration. The Tmax after inhaled administration was 1.5 ± 0.5 hours. 
In a study of 9 cystic fibrosis patients (6 adults, 3 adolescents), using 400 mg inhaled mannitol as a 
single dose (Day 1) then twice a day for 7 days (Days 2 - 7), pharmacokinetic parameters were similar 
for adults and adolescents, except for a longer average apparent terminal half life for adolescents 
(Day 1 = 7.29 hours, Day 7 = 6.52 hours) compared with adults (Day 1 = 6.10 hours, 
Day 7 = 5.42 hours). Overall, the comparison of AUCs between Day 1 and Day 7 showed a time 
independence of pharmacokinetics, indicating linearity at the dose level administered in this study. 
Biotransformation 
A small percentage of systemically absorbed mannitol undergoes hepatic metabolism to glycogen and 
carbon dioxide. Studies in rats, mice and humans have demonstrated that mannitol has no toxic 
metabolites. The metabolic pathway of inhaled mannitol was not examined in pharmacokinetic 
studies. 
Distribution 
Lung deposition studies have demonstrated a 24.7% deposition of inhaled mannitol confirming its 
distribution to the target organ. Nonclinical toxicology studies indicate that mannitol inhaled into the 
lungs is absorbed into the bloodstream, with the maximum serum concentration being achieved 
occurring at 1 hour. There is no evidence that mannitol is accumulated in the body, therefore 
distribution of inhaled mannitol was not examined in PK studies. 
Elimination 
The cumulative amount of mannitol filtered into the urine over the 24 hour collection period was 
similar for inhaled (55%) and oral (54%) mannitol. When administered intravenously, mannitol is 
eliminated largely unchanged by glomerular filtration and 87% of the dose is excreted in the urine 
within 24 hours. The mean terminal half-life in adults was approximately 4 to 5 hours from serum and 
approximately 3.66 hours from urine. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Bronchitol in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years has not yet been 
established. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The limited data available in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years indicate the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of inhaled mannitol are similar to the adult population.  
There are no data available for children under 12 years of age. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In male rats after 13 weeks of inhaled mannitol dosing, elevated circulating lymphocyte numbers and 
mandibular lymph node plasmacytosis was observed at doses greater than 9.3 fold the maximal dose. 
The elevated lymphocyte count was within historical control values, did not progress and was 
essentially resolved by the end of the in life phase of the study and following withdrawal of treatment. 
This effect was not noted in any other species and did not result in clinical signs. 
In dogs an increased occurrence of coughing was observed both during and immediately post dose for 
low and high dose inhaled mannitol administration. No treatment-related adverse effect occurred 
greater than 13 fold the maximal therapeutic dose. 
No mutagenic or genotoxic effect has been revealed when mannitol was assayed in a standard battery 
of genotoxicity tests. 
Mannitol was shown not to be an irritant in an isolated bovine eye assay or when introduced into 
rabbit eyes. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed when dietary mannitol (≤5%) was administered to mice 
and rats for 2 years. Carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with inhaled mannitol. 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity studies have not been carried out with inhaled mannitol. 
However, studies conducted with mannitol administered via other routes indicated no effect on foetal 
survival in mice, rats and hamsters and on embryo and foetal development in rats and rabbits. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been carried out with inhaled mannitol. However, studies 
conducted with orally administered mannitol indicated no teratogenic effects in mice or rats, at doses 
of up to 1.6 g/kg, or in hamsters at 1.2 g/kg.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Bronchitol is and what it is used for 
What Bronchitol is 
Bronchitol contains a medicine called mannitol which is a mucolytic agent. 
What Bronchitol is used for 
Bronchitol is for use in adults 18 years of age and over. As well as using Bronchitol you will normally 
keep using the other medicines you take for cystic fibrosis.  
How Bronchitol works 
Bronchitol is inhaled into the lungs to help with cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease that affects the 
glands in the lungs, gut and pancreas that secrete fluids such as mucus and digestive juices. 
Bronchitol helps by increasing the amount of water on the surface of your airways and in your mucus. 
This helps your lungs to clear mucus more easily. It also helps improve the condition of your lungs 
and your breathing. As a result you may get a ‘productive cough’, which also helps to remove mucus 
from your lungs. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Bronchitol 
Do not use Bronchitol 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to mannitol  
if you are sensitive to mannitol. Before you are started on Bronchitol, your doctor will check 
whether your airways are too sensitive to mannitol. If you are too sensitive to mannitol, your 
airways will become narrower, and you may find it harder to breathe. 
If either of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using this medicine: 
- 
- 
if you have asthma; 
if you have ever coughed up blood or had blood in your sputum; 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
if you have severe cystic fibrosis, in particular if your lung function measured by the Forced 
Expiratory Volume in first second of expiration (FEV1) is usually less than 30%. 
Inhaling medicines can cause chest tightness and wheezing and this can happen immediately after 
taking this medicine. Your doctor will help you take your first dose of Bronchitol and check your lung 
function before, during and after dosing. Your doctor may ask you to use other medicines such as a 
bronchodilator before taking Bronchitol. 
Inhaling medicines can also cause cough and this can happen with Bronchitol. Talk to your doctor if 
the cough won’t go away or worries you. 
Children and adolescents 
Bronchitol should not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18. This is because there is 
limited information in this group of people. 
Other medicines and Bronchitol 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
You can carry on using your medicines for cystic fibrosis when you are using Bronchitol, this includes 
inhaled antibiotics such as tobramycin and colistimethate sodium. If you are not sure, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist before using Bronchitol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
- 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before using this medicine. You should avoid using this medicine if you are pregnant. 
If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed ask your doctor for advice before using this 
medicine. It is not known if this medicine passes into the breast milk. 
- 
Driving and using machines 
Bronchitol is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. 
3. 
How to use Bronchitol 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Always take your bronchodilator before using Bronchitol.  
How much to use 
Adults 18 years of age and over 
Initiation dose 
Before you are prescribed Bronchitol your doctor will help you take your first dose of Bronchitol and 
test your lung function at each step to make sure you aren’t sensitive to mannitol. The first dose is 
taken in 4 steps:-  
Step 1 – 1 capsule (40 mg) 
Step 2 – 2 capsules (80 mg) 
Step 3 – 3 capsules (120 mg) 
Step 4 – 4 capsules (160 mg) 
At the end of the initiation dose you will have taken 10 capsules (400 mg) which is the same as the 
usual dose. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment dose (2-week packs) 
- 
- 
You must use Bronchitol every day. 
The usual dose is 10 capsules (400 mg) inhaled in the morning, and 10 capsules inhaled in the 
evening. 
Have the evening dose at least 2 to 3 hours before you go to bed. 
For the best results, inhale each capsule one after another, so there is as little delay as possible 
between capsules. 
Use your bronchodilator; 
Order of using this medicine 
Use Bronchitol as part of your normal daily treatment routine. The suggested order is as follows, 
unless otherwise advised by your doctor: 
1. 
2.  Wait 5 to 15 minutes; 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Use your Bronchitol before physiotherapy if this is part of your treatment routine. 
Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) if this is part of your treatment routine 
Inhaled antibiotics if this is part of your treatment routine 
How to use your medicine 
- 
Bronchitol is breathed in (inhaled) as a powder from the capsule using the inhaler supplied in 
the pack. It is for inhalation use only and must not be administered by any other route. The 
capsules must not be swallowed.  
The powder in the capsules must only be inhaled using the inhaler included in the pack.

- 
- 
- 
The doctor may give you oxygen and medicines to help you breathe. 
feel that you cannot breathe; 
become wheezy; 
cough a lot. 
If you forget to use Bronchitol 
- 
If you forget a dose, use it as soon as you remember it and carry on as usual. However, if it is 
nearly time for the next dose, skip the missed dose. 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
- 
If you stop using Bronchitol 
If you stop using Bronchitol your symptoms may get worse. Do not stop using your Bronchitol 
without talking to your doctor first, even if you feel better. Your doctor will tell you how long to use

How to use the inhaler 
Below is a diagram that shows what the inhaler looks like. Bronchitol capsules can only be used with 
the inhaler provided in the pack. 
Inhaler device 
The following steps explain how to use the inhaler. For more advice on how to look after your inhaler, 
please see the end of the instructions. 
1. 
- 
Take off the cap 
Using both hands, hold the inhaler upright and 
take off the cap. 
2. 
- 
- 
- 
3. 
- 
- 
- 
Open the inhaler 
Hold the bottom of the inhaler firmly with one 
hand. 
You should hold the inhaler along the bottom 
to make sure you don’t press the piercing 
buttons. 
Then open it by turning the mouth-piece in the 
direction of the arrow on the inhaler. 
Put in the capsule 
First make sure your hands are dry. 
Then take out a capsule from the blister (only 
remove the capsule just before use). 
Put the capsule into the capsule-shaped space 
in the bottom of the inhaler.

4. 
- 
- 
Close the inhaler 
Keep the inhaler in an upright position. 
Then twist the mouth-piece into the closed 
position - when it is closed you will hear a 
‘click’. 
5.  Make a hole in the capsule  
- 
This lets the powder in the capsule be 
released when you breathe in. In this leaflet 
we call making the hole ‘piercing’. 
Hold the inhaler upright and fully press in 
both ‘Piercing’ buttons on the sides of the 
inhaler at the same time, then release them. 
Only do this once. This is because piercing 
the capsule more than once may make it split 
or break-up.

7.

- 
Prepare for inhalation 
Tilt the inhaler so that the mouth-piece faces 
slightly downward. 
This allows the capsule to drop forward into 
the spinning chamber. 
Keep the inhaler tilted in this way and 
breathe out completely (away from the 
inhaler). 
Inhale 
Tilt your head back slightly. 
Keeping the inhaler tilted downward, put the 
inhaler to your mouth and make sure you 
close your lips tightly around the 
mouth-piece. 
Take a steady deep breath in, to fill your 
lungs - then hold your breath for 5 seconds. 
When you breathe in you should hear a 
‘rattling’ sound as the capsule spins in the 
inhaler. If this does not happen, the capsule 
may be stuck. 
If you do not hear the rattling, hold the inhaler with the mouth-piece facing downwards, and tap 
the bottom firmly. Do not try to loosen the capsule by pressing the piercing buttons again. 
Repeat the inhalation to get your dose.

8. 
- 
- 
Breathe out 
Take the inhaler away from your mouth. 
Breathe out, and then breathe normally again. 
9. 
- 
Check the capsule 
Look to see if the capsule is empty - the 
capsule must spin in the inhaler in order to 
empty. If the capsule has not emptied you 
may need to repeat steps 6 to 8. 
10.  Take out the used capsule  
- 
Turn the inhaler upside down, tap the bottom and throw the empty capsule away. 
11.  Repeat steps 3 to 10 for each capsule  
- 
- 
Perform these steps for each of the ten capsules.  
To get the best results from Bronchitol, inhale each capsule one after another.

Keep your inhaler dry and always make sure your hands are dry before using it. 
Never breathe or cough into your inhaler. 
Never take your inhaler apart. 
Never place a capsule directly into the mouth-piece of your inhaler. 
Never leave a used capsule in your inhaler chamber. 
Use a new inhaler each week. 
If your inhaler breaks, use your second inhaler and talk to your doctor. 
Ensure your inhaler is empty. 
Cleaning the inhaler - Usually your inhaler will give you the correct dose of medicine for 7 days 
without needing cleaning. However, if your inhaler does need cleaning, the steps to follow are: 
1. 
2.  Wash your inhaler in warm water with the mouth-piece open.  
3. 
4. 
5. 
Shake it until there are no large water droplets left in the inhaler.  
Leave it to dry in the air - lay it on its side with the mouth-piece open. 
You must let it fully dry, this can take up to 24 hours. While it is drying, use your other inhaler.

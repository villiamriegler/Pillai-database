2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death 
among females worldwide, accounting for 23% (1.38 million) of all new cancer cases and 14% of 
the cancer deaths in females in 2011 (Jemal, Bray et al. 2011).  In developed countries, the 
majority of cases are diagnosed when the disease is confined to the breast or has spread only to 
regional lymph nodes and can be treated with curative intent; however 25%-40% of such 
patients will develop metastatic disease (Guarneri and Conte 2009).  For metastatic breast 
cancer (MBC) overall, the median survival time for patients with metastatic tumors at first 
diagnosis is approximately 24 months, and only 18%-23% of patients (in the US and Europe) will 
live at least 5 years after diagnosis of MBC (Sant, Allemani et al. 2003; Howlader, Noone et al. 
2011). 
MBC remains incurable, and an estimated 450,000 patients globally die from breast cancer per 
annum (Ferlay, Shin et al. 2010).  Of these, approximately 15%-20% (60,000~90,000) are 
likely to be due to HER2-positive disease. Amplification of human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) is associated with shortened survival (Slamon, Clark et al. 1987; Slamon, 
Leyland-Jones et al. 2001). 
Trastuzumab plus a taxane is approved in the first-line setting for MBC in HER2-positive patients 
based on data from patients who had not been previously treated with trastuzumab (Slamon, 
Leyland-Jones et al. 2001; Marty, Cognetti et al. 2005).  The currently approved combination 
regimen for the treatment of HER2-positive MBC in second-line treatment is lapatinib plus 
capecitabine (Cameron, Casey et al. 2008). 
Trastuzumab emtansine (also known as T-DM1) is a novel antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) 
that contains the humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 antibody trastuzumab and DM1, a microtubule-
inhibitory maytansinoid, linked through a thioether bond. Trastuzumab emtansine retains the 
mechanisms of action of both trastuzumab and DM1.  It binds to HER2, and triggers the same 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 8/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
  
  
anti-tumor activities as trastuzumab, including suppression of HER2 signaling pathways, HER2 
ECD shedding, and mediation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
Trastuzumab emtansine is then internalized and degraded to release DM1-containing cytotoxic 
components  which cause inhibition of cell division and cell growth, and eventually cell death. The 
targeted delivery of DM1 is expected to improve the therapeutic window compared with the 
unconjugated molecule. 
This application is seeking approval for the use of trastuzumab emtansine for the following 
indication:  
“Trastuzumab emtansine, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2-
positive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received prior 
treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane.” 
The recommended dose of trastuzumab emtansine (see SmPC section 4.2) is 3.6 mg/kg 
bodyweight administered as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle). Patients 
should be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The initial dose should be 
administered as a 90 minute intravenous infusion. Patients should be observed during the 
infusion and for at least 90 minutes following the initial infusion for fever, chills, or other 
infusion-related reactions. The infusion site should be closely monitored for possible 
subcutaneous infiltration during administration (see SmPC section 4.8). If the prior infusion was 
well tolerated, subsequent doses of trastuzumab emtansine may be administered as 30 minute 
infusions. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after 
infusion. The infusion rate of trastuzumab emtansine should be slowed or interrupted if the 
patient develops infusion-related symptoms (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Trastuzumab 
emtansine should be discontinued in case of life-threatening infusion reactions. Medicinal 
products to treat allergic/anaphylactic infusion reactions, as well as emergency equipment should 
be available for immediate use (see section SmPC 4.4). Trastuzumab emtansine must be 
reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional and administered as an intravenous 
infusion. It must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. Methods of administration 
are described in the SmPC (see sections 4.2 and 6.6). Trastuzumab emtansine is contraindicated 
in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see SmPC 
section 6.1). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A number of Scientific Advices have been given to Trastuzumab emtansine by National Agencies 
as well as CHMP. Two Advices in relation to Quality have been given in November 2009 (DK and 
PT) and in June 2011 (follow-up (DE and BE)). 
Trastuzumab emtansine consists of the antibody trastuzumab conjugated to the cytotoxic drug 
DM1. The DM1 is linked to the lysidne residues on the antibody via the heterobifunctional 
reagent trans-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane- 1-carboxylate (SMCC).

Trastuzumab emtansine exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against a number of cultured 
cell lines that over-express p185HER2. In addition, trastuzumab emtansine is effective in several 
murine models of HER2-positive breast cancer, including ones that do not respond to 
unconjugated trastuzumab. Although the primary mechanism of action of trastuzumab emtansine 
is distinct from that of unconjugated trastuzumab, the two molecules are similar with respect to 
a number of biological activities including binding to recombinant HER2 ECD, C1q, and the 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Trastuzumab emtansine also showed similar binding to FcγRI and 
moderately increased (2- to 3-fold) binding to FcγRIIa and IIb, compared with unconjugated 
trastuzumab. Additionally, trastuzumab emtansine showed similar FcγRIIIa binding activity and 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to unconjugated trastuzumab. 
New Active substance status: 
Trastuzumab emtansine, is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate which contains the 
humanised anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab, covalently linked to the microtubule inhibitory product 
DM1 (a maytansine derivative) with the stable thioether MCC (4-[N-maleimidomethyl] 
cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) linker. 
Trastuzumab emtansine is produced from two intermediates (DM1 and trastuzumab) and a 
starting material (SMCC), each of which is tested and released using methods and specifications 
appropriate to its molecular type (small molecule or protein). The resulting antibody conjugate 
product exhibits a unique and specific set of product characteristics, distinct from the 
intermediates used in its production.

Manufacture of the product 
Trastuzumab emtansine is manufactured as a lyophilised Drug Product formulation Drug Product 
is produced in a 100 mg or 160 mg per vial configuration, and the bulk protein concentration is 
20 mg/mL.  Drug Product is aseptically filled  into a glass vial that is closed with a lyophilisation 
stopper, and crimped with an aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. 
The frozen Drug Substance is thawed, re-circulated until homogeneous, and stored at 2°C–8°C 
until further processing.  
In preparation for filling, Drug Substance is sterile-filtered through a sterile 0.22 μm nominal 
pore size membrane filter into a filling vessel. Empty vials are subjected to an internal and 
external cleaning. Stoppers are washed and steam-sterilized  
Prior to filling, the sterile-filtered bulk is again filtered through a second sterilised 0.2 μm pore 
size filling reservoir that feeds the filling needles. The product is filled into depyrogenated 
USP/Ph. Eur./JP Type I 15 mL or 20 mL glass vials. Filled glass vials are partially stoppered with 
lyophilisation stoppers during the filling process and automatically conveyed to a tray loader for 
loading into lyophilisation trays. Prior to the filling operations, the product-contacting parts of the 
filling machine are sterilized in place. 
The contents of the partially stoppered vials are lyophilised and the vials are then fully stoppered 
by collapsing the lyophiliser shelves.  
Upon the completion of the lyophilisation process, vials are unloaded and transferred to the 
capper. The vials are crimped with sterilized 20 mm aluminum seals fitted with plastic flip-off 
caps. Following capping, vials are transferred to an exterior vial washer. The exterior vial washer 
rinses the outside of product vials from the shoulder down with WFI. The vials are then dried 
with compressed air. 
Filled and capped vials are 100% visually inspected by means of manual inspection. After the 
final vial inspection, the batch is sampled for Drug Product release testing. Before the inspection 
process, the vials may undergo interim storage at 2°C−8°C. After the inspection process, the 
vials are quarantined and stored at 2°C−8°C pending release. 
Vials are released by the Quality Unit (QU) and delivered at 2°C−8°C by qualified shippers to the 
labelling facility. When the labelling and packaging operation is completed, the vials and labels 
are reconciled, and the vials are stored at 2°C−8°C pending final QU release.  
For the Drug Product process, several process parameters were evaluated for their criticality with 
respect to the predetermined quality attributes.  
Process validation  
Process validation studies for trastuzumab emtansine Drug Product were carried out using the 
commercial process parameters.  
Overall, the approach used to validate the DP production process is adequate as the obtained 
data demonstrate that the process is under control.

Non-clinical issues were addressed on 3 occasions in relation to cardiotoxicity, reproductive 
toxicity and environmental risk assessment. The CHMP advices were followed. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The in vitro pharmacodynamic properties of T-DM1 were compared with unconjugated 
trastuzumab with respect to:  
•  Binding activity to HER2 extracellular domain  
•  Binding activity with Fc gamma (Fcγ) receptors (RIa RIIa, RIIb, RIIIa V158, and RIIIa 
F158)  
•  Binding activity with complement C1q  
• 
Induction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  
•  Anti-proliferative activity in a variety of HER2-positive cell lines  
•  Ability to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The effect on cell-cycle progression 
The effect on PI3 kinase signaling pathway 
The effect on HER2 extracellular domain shedding 
The anti-proliferative effect in trastuzumab resistant cell lines 
Trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) bound to the extracellular domain of human 
HER2 in vitro with similar affinity and binding kinetics. Hence, average KD values were 
determined to be 1.08 nM for T-DM1 and 1.01 nM for trastuzumab as determined by Surface 
Plasmon Resonance technology. Trastuzumab and T-DM1 display similar binding affinities for Fcγ 
receptors.  
Comparable binding curves for T-DM1 and trastuzumab were observed in an ELISA assay 
applying purified human complement C1q (EC50 for T-DM1 was 1.4 µg/mL and EC50 for 
trastuzumab was 1.2 µg/mL).  
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 18/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
  
  
T-DM1 induced a slightly increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
activity compared with unconjugated trastuzumab. The anti-proliferative activity of T-DM1 and 
trastuzumab was compared in various breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of 
HER2. Cell viability was reduced to a greater extent by T-DM1 than trastuzumab in all HER2 
over-expressing breast cancer cell lines (HER2 ≥ 2 +). Moreover, T-DM1 treatment induced a 
potent anti-proliferative response in cell lines resistant to trastuzumab (KPL-4, HCC1954, BT-
474EEI). For the cell lines with normal (MCF7) or no HER2 expression (MDA-MB-468), the cell 
viability was only affected at high T-DM1 concentrations (10 μg/mL). Trastuzumab displayed no 
activity in the cell lines with no or normal HER2 expression. 
T-DM1 induced caspase-3 and -7 activation (markers of apoptosis) in a dose-dependent manner 
in the breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3, BT-474 and KPL-4. Since trastuzumab did not induce 
caspase-3 and -7 activation, the effect was caused by the DM1 moiety. In addition, exposure of 
breast cancer cell lines to T-DM1 (≥30 ng/mL) and DM-1 (≥20 nM) resulted in an increase in 
G2/M phase cells, as would be predicted by an agent that disrupts microtubule function. The 
arrest of cell division late in the cell cycle (G2/M phase) resulted in the activation of the intrinsic 
apoptosis pathway and cell death. Trastuzumab, on the other hand, inhibited the growth of 
breast cancer cell lines by arresting the cells early in the cell cycle (G0/G1 phase).   
Maximal inhibition of HER2 extracellular domain shedding into the growth media of BT-474-M1 
cells, was 42% with trastuzumab exposure and 43% with T-DM1 exposure. The IC 50 values for 
the antibodies were 0.3 μg/mL and 0.184 μg/mL, respectively.  
The anti-proliferative activity of T-DM1 was evaluated in HER2-positive cell lines resistant to 
trastuzumab (non−small cell lung cancer cell line Calu-3, SK-OV-3, gastric carcinoma cell line 
MKN7, and a cell line established from BT-474 cell, BT-474-EI). A dose-dependent anti-
proliferative activity was observed for T-DM1 in all four cell types. In contrast, trastuzumab 
showed virtually no activity except at high doses in Calu-3 cells. 
SK-BR-3 cells were treated with T-DM1 for a variety of time exposures and incubated further in 
conjugate-free media to investigate whether the cytotoxic effects are long-lived (study 05-1111). 
After treatment of SK-BR-3 cells with T-DM1 for 10, 30, or 60 minutes, or 72 hours, the media 
were removed, the cells were washed once, and fresh media (containing no conjugate) added for 
a total incubation period of 72 hours. At the highest concentration (1 μg/mL) the anti-
proliferative activity resulting from a 10-minute exposure was equivalent to the activity of 
exposure for the full 72 hours. 
Similar in vitro pharmacodynamic properties were seen for various T-DM1 batches when 
evaluated with respect to HER2 binding, binding to Fcγ receptors, C1q binding, ADCC and anti-
proliferative activity in five breast cancer cell lines.  
The majority of the nude mice bearing trastuzumab-resistant BT474EI (HER 2+) breast cancer 
cell line tumours, experienced complete tumour regression following p.o. administration of 
weekly or once every three weeks T-DM1 doses ≥10 mg/kg. Moreover, a similar frequency of 
tumour-bearing mice experienced complete tumour regression following twice weekly 
administration of 18 mg/kg T-DM1. The anti-tumour efficacy of p.o. T-DM1 was also evaluated in 
nude mice bearing MMTV-HER2 mammary tumours (HER 2+). When evaluated at doses giving

(number of complete MMTV-HER2 tumour responses) was obtained with dosing once every three 
weeks than with weekly dosing. Still, the tumour regression was transient with detectable 
tumours returning following a treatment-free period. The tumour response was observed at 
clinically relevant T-DM1 serum concentration levels (clinical Cmax is 80 μg/mL).

Safety pharmacology programme 
Two studies were submitted: 
A Single Dose Intravenous Cardiovascular Safety Pharmacology Study of T-DM1 Administered to 
Female Cynomolgus Monkeys with a 3 Week Recovery Period  
Female cynomolgus monkeys were surgically fitted with a large animal electrocardiogram (ECG) 
and pressure transmitter. Four animals were allocated to each group, and dosed with either 0, 3, 
10 or 30 mg/kg T-DM1 in an iv bolus injection in the saphenous vein on Day 1. The dosing was 
followed by a 3 week dosing free period. ECG and pressure measurements were recorded twice 
in the pre-treatment period. On Day 1; at least 60 minutes prior to treatment, and 8 hours after 
treatment were recorded continuously, followed by 10 minutes every hour for at least 24 hours. 
On Days 3, 4, 5, 8, 15 and 22 at least 10 minutes of recordings were made around the same 
time of day as dosing were performed on Day 1. Four hours post dose a statistically significant 
decrease in the uncorrected QT interval was observed in Group 2 (3 mg/kg T-DM1) and 4 (30 
mg/kg T-DM1). However, no effect was observed on the corrected QT interval for these groups at 
that time point, and a slight (not statistically significant) increase in the heart rate was observed. 
As no other differences were recorded, this was considered to be unrelated to treatment with T-
DM1 by the Study Director. 
No statistically significant differences were observed with regards to the heart rate and systolic, 
diastolic, mean arterial, and pulse pressures (systolic-diastolic). However, the high dose group 
(30 mg/kg) showed elevated systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse pressure values when compared 
to the control group from approximately Day 3 and until Day 22 (statistically nonsignificant but 
n=4/group). During the study period mean exposure levels ranged from 322 μg/mL on Day 2 to 
90.9 μg/mL on Day 22.  
Intra-thoracic pressure measurements included respiratory rate and a qualitative assessment of 
respiratory depth. Respiratory parameters were quantified in 1 minute means, at similar time 
points as specified for the ECG and blood pressure parameters. Not statistically significant 
differences were observed with respect to the respiratory rate or depth. 
Blood samples for anti-drug antibody analysis were taken pre-dose and on Day 22. No anti-drug 
antibodies were detected in the post dose samples. However, one pre-dose sample from a Group 
3 animal was positive. The sensitivity of the assay was such that 8% false positive samples 
would be detected. 
Blood samples for toxicokinetic measurements were sampled pre-dose, on Day 2 and on Day 22. 
No T-DM1 was detected in the pre-dose samples, or in Group 1 (negative control). Increasing 
total trastuzumab plasma levels were recorded in Groups 2 (38.4 μg/mL) to 4 (332 μg/mL) on

Day 2, and 1.36 to 90.9 μg/mL respectively on Day 22, proving that the animals had indeed been 
exposed to the test article, in the appropriate doses. 
Effects of DM1 on Cloned hERG Potassium Channels Expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells 
The in vitro effects of DM1 on ionic currents in voltage-clamped human embryonic kidney cells 
(HEK293) that stably express the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) were determined. 
DM1 in concentrations of 2.6, 8.8 and 29.5 μM (nominal 3, 10 and 30 μM), was applied to the 
test system. The lower than expected recovery of DM1 following dose formulation analysis, was 
determined to be due to adherence of DM1 to plastics and standard glassware. The DM1 
solutions were therefore prepared in silanized glassware (to avoid the adherence of DM1 to the 
glassware) however, when handling the dose formulations during preparation and sampling, non-
silanized items such as micropipette tips had to be used. Therefore the measured concentrations 
of 2.6, 8.8 and 29.5 μM were reported. 
DM1 inhibited hERG current by 0.3%, 1.0% and 2.5% in low, medium and high dose levels 
respectively, versus 0.63% in control (n=3). The positive control (60 nM terfenadine) inhibited 
hERG potassium current by 82% (n=2). 
The IC20 and IC50 could not be determined, as the high concentration was selected based on 
maximum solubility. As 29.5 μM DM1 caused only 2.5% inhibition, both IC20 and IC50 were 
estimated to be greater than the tested highest dose. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
One study has been submitted: 
The influence of Trastuzumab on MMTV-HER2 Fo5 Tumour response to T-DM1 conjugates 
In this study, the potency of T-DM1, as both the MCC- and SPP- conjugate (un-cleavable and 
cleavable linker respectively) were investigated in the presence of trastuzumab (Herceptin). The 
MMTV-HER2 Fo5 tumour model overexpress HER2 (>1,000,000 copies of human HER2 per cell) 
and does not respond to trastuzumab treatment. Therefore the drug interaction, between T-DM1 
and trastuzumab competing for the HER2 antigenic sites can be evaluated. A control antibody 
(anti-IL8) was also administered, that would have no physiologic effect in the mice, as the target 
is not expressed in mice. An IV bolus of 15 mg/kg trastuzumab or anti-IL8 was followed 4 hours 
later (t=0) by either 0 or 10 mg/kg T-MCC-DM1 (T-DM1) or T-SPP-DM1 IV. To ensure that the 
circulating levels of trastuzumab would stay above 80 μg/mL in the animals receiving 
trastuzumab, an osmotic pump was inserted, which administered 0.5 mg/kg/day trastuzumab 
intraperitoneally for approximately 25 days. However, the serum concentrations of trastuzumab 
only persisted above 80 μg/mL until Day 7, and by Day 10 had dropped to 40.9 μg/mL, and 
continued to drop until end of study. 
The anti-IL8 and trastuzumab monotherapy showed rapid tumour progression and a mean time 
to tumour doubling of 8 days, and survival time of approximately 10 days. The conjugated 
antibody therapies, alone and with trastuzumab showed slower mean time to tumour doubling of 
12-14 days, and a survival time of up to 20 days or longer.  
Total trastuzumab as well as conjugated trastuzumab concentrations were measured with an 
ELISA assay. Total trastuzumab were generally higher than conjugated trastuzumab following T-

DM1 treatment. Furthermore, conjugated trastuzumab concentrations were higher following 
treatment with T-DM1 than with T-SPP-DM1, supporting that T-SPP-DM1 de-conjugates due to 
the cleavable SPP-linker. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The structural complexity of T-DM1 resulted in the development of both enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in order to quantify T-DM1 and total trastuzumab in serum from 
rats and cynomolgus and LC-MS/MS assays in order to detect free DM1 in plasma from rats and 
monkeys. In addition, a method for the determination of antibodies against T-DM1 was validated 
in cynomolgus monkey serum. The validations of the developed methods of analysis were all 
conducted according to GLP.  
Absorption 
T-DM1 is intended for IV administration, and therefore this route of administration was used in 
the non-clinical studies. The PK of T-DM1 was evaluated in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys, 
whereas the PK of DM1 or MCC-DM1 (DM1 with linker) was characterized in rats or mice.  
The pharmacokinetics of T-DM1 in mice was evaluated over a single-dose range of 0.3 to 15 
mg/kg, with plasma or serum clearance ranging from approximately 13 to 19.2 mL/day/kg. As 
was expected in species that do not express the target molecule (human HER2), 
pharmacokinetics (CL, V1, T½, β) were similar across all doses. Clearance appeared independent 
of dose, and was not affected by the presence of HER2-positive tumours. The terminal half-life 
(T½, β) was estimated at 4.23-13.1 days, and the volume of distribution was similar to plasma or 
serum volume (40.5-62.9 mL/kg). 
In rats, the pharmacokinetics of T-DM1 was evaluated following single doses ranging from 0.3 to 
20 mg/kg. Again, since T-DM1 does not express affinity towards rat HER2, the pharmacokinetic 
parameters (CL, V1, T½, β) were similar across all doses. Plasma or serum clearance of T-DM1 
ranged from 10.1 to 22.1 mL/day/kg. The terminal half-life of T-DM1 varied from 4.9 to 5.4 days 
while the volume of distribution ranged from 72.9 to 149 mL/kg. No gender differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters were noted rats. 
The pharmacokinetics of T-DM1 in cynomolgus monkeys following a single dose was investigated 
in both male and female monkeys over a dose range of 0.3 to 30 mg/kg. T-DM1 binds to 
cynomolgus HER2, resulting in some degree of target-mediated clearance. The clearance was 
fastest at low doses (40.4 mL/day/kg at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg), decreasing to approximately 
around 16.5 mL/day/kg at 3 mg/kg and 10.1 mL/day/kg at 30 mg/kg. As expected terminal half-
life was inversely related to clearance, ranging from approximately 1 day at 0.3 mg/kg to 5.30 
days at 30 mg/kg. The volume of distribution appeared to increase with dose, although the 
increase was not dose proportional. Hence, Vss was 44.2 mL/kg at 0.3 mg/kg and 68.6 mL/kg at 
30 mg/kg. No gender differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were noted in monkeys. 
Plasma DM1 concentrations, peaked immediately after T-DM1 administration, decreased over 
time, and were generally proportional to T-DM1 concentrations. This behaviour was not 
consistent with typical metabolite/catabolite pharmacokinetics. DM1 concentrations in plasma

may be affected by DM1 liberated from T-DM1, during the processing of plasma sampling. 
Consequently, the measured plasma DM1 concentrations might be higher than the actual 
concentrations of DM1 that have been released from T-DM1 in vivo. 
The pharmacokinetics of DM1 in rodents after DM1 administration, waqs characterized by a large 
apparent Volume of distribution (> 5,000 mL/kg) and a CL ranging from 25 to 80 mL/min/kg in 
rats to >200 mL/min/kg, in mice. 
Distribution 
Radiolabelled T-DM1 and trastuzumab, [125I]-trastuzumab-MCC-DM1, trastuzumab-MCC-[3H]DM1 
and [3H]DM1 were used to assess the impact of drug conjugation on trastuzumab and DM1 
distribution as well as the potential for accumulation following a single IV dosing in rats. Still, the 
results should be interpreted with caution since the rat is a pharmacodynamically irrelevant 
species in the sense that T-DM1 does not bind to rat HER2.  
T-DM1 and trastuzumab-related radioactivity was mainly confined to the blood compartment 
followed by highly perfused organs, e.g., lungs, liver and kidney. When 3H-labelled DM1 was 
administered, the radioactivity quickly distributed to the tissues with the highest levels of 
radioactivity being found in the lungs and kidneys, followed by liver spleen and adrenals. Neither 
T-DM1 nor free DM1 were associated with tissue persistence or accumulation.  
When T-DM1 and trastuzumab tissue distribution was compared, a similar pattern of distribution 
over time was seen, indicating that the antibody component mediates the tissue distribution of T-
DM1. However, T-DM1 was cleared faster from tissues than trastuzumab.  
Across the concentrations, the protein binding was fairly constant at 97.1%, 91.5% and 92.5% 
in rat, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma, respectively.  
Metabolism 
Upon administration, T-DM1 is thought to undergo linker cleavage, in cells or plasma, releasing 
DM1 or other DM1-containing catabolites. The other process is cellular uptake and catabolism of 
T-DM1 resulting in amino acids deriving from trastuzumab and DM1-containing catabolic 
products. Although the linker is designed to be stable under physiological conditions, in vitro and 
in vivo data showed that it undergoes cleavage. While no T-DM1 de-conjugation was observed 
for the first two days following IV administration to rats, by Day 14, only 40% of the total 
trastuzumab circulating in the plasma was T-DM1. The T-DM1 catabolite Lys-MCC-DM1 was 
present at the highest concentration in the urine and bile of rats administered T-DM1 followed by 
MCC-DM1 and DM1. Lys-MCC-DM1 and MCC-DM1 are pharmacodynamically inactive in an in vitro 
assay. DM1 undergoes extensive metabolism in rats hence eleven metabolites were identified in 
the bile collected from bile duct cannulated rats receiving 3H-labelled DM1. In vitro studies 
applying human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes indicated CYP3A4 
and CYP3A5 are responsible for DM1 metabolism.  
Excretion 
The primary excretion route for T-DM1 in rats was bile (approximately 50% of the administered 
dose) followed by faeces, whereas only a minor part was excreted in the urine (7-8%). In both 
urine and faeces the majority of the radioactively labelled DM1 had been de-conjugated from the 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 23/121

trastuzumab moiety. Thogh without any supporting evidence, the potential of DM1 and its 
catabolites to undergo entero-hepatic recirculation in rats cannot be completely ruled out.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro metabolism studies suggested that DM1 does not induce or inhibit P-450–mediated 
metabolism at the highest concentration tested (600 ng/mL). DM1 is a weak time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro. However, the risk of DM1 as a potential time-dependent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 in vivo in humans is considered low given the low systemic exposure of DM1. 
DM1 appeared to be a substrate but not an inhibitor of P-gp when tested at 0.5 μM in MDCKII-
MDR1 cells. Based on in vitro data, DM1 does not appear to be a breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) substrate. The few clinical data available do not indicate that concomitant treatment with 
OATP 1B1 and 1B3 inhibitors results in pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Regarding the 
potential interaction with drugs considered in vivo inhibitors of the renal transporters OCT2, 
OAT1, and OAT3, a discussion on data from the University of Washington DDI database has been 
provided considering cimetidine (OCT2, OAT3), quinidine (OCT2), probenecid (OAT2, OAT3), and 
diclofenac (OAT3). For all these drugs, a Ki value not lower than 1.3 µM has been reported. 
Considering the unbound DM1 Cmax of 0.6 nM, a relevant inhibition of these transporters can be 
considered very unlikely.

Repeat dose toxicity 
One repeat dose toxicity study was performed in rats, and 4 repeat dose studies were performed 
with cynomolgyus monkeys. As the rat as a species does not express a target for the antibody 
moiety of the T-DM1, the observed toxicity in the rat is expected to be non-target specific 
toxicity.

Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of DM1 was evaluated in a reverse mutation assay with Salmonella strains as 
well as an in vivo chromosome aberration test performed in rats. See table below summarizing 
the results obtained in these two studies, as well as the micronucleus evaluation performed as 
part of the pivotal monkey T-DM1 repeat-dose toxicity study.

Haemolytic potential and blood compatibility 
The haemolytic potential and blood compatibility were evaluated in human and cynomolgus 
monkey blood (Study No 041257-1459). One human volunteer and 3 cynomolgus monkeys were 
sampled. T-DM1 in 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL were added to the samples, as well as control 
article, plasma (negative control) and 1% saponin (positive control). Sample and test or control 
article volume was equal (0.5 mL), therefore the final concentration in whole blood, serum or 
plasma. No positive or negative controls were used in the blood compatibility assay. T-DM1 did 
not cause hemolysis in either cynomolgus monkey or human blood and was compatible with 
cynomolgus monkey and human serum and plasma. 
Cross-Reactivity of T-DM1 with human and cynomolgus tissue in vitro 
This study was performed to compare and characterize the target antigen-specific and non-target 
binding of T- DM1. Two concentrations of T-DM1 (1.0 and 10 μg/mL) was applied to cryosections 
from a full panel of human and cynomolgus monkey tissues and immunohistochemically detected 
with a mouse anti-DM1 secondary antibody followed by a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG tertiary 
antibody.  
Human tissues were collected as surgical or autopsy specimens, and cynomolgus tissues were 
collected as necropsy specimens from three individuals in both species. Negative controls for

each tissue were generated using Human IgG1κ antibody (isotype control) in place of T-DM1 at 
the same concentrations defined for the test article (1.0 and 10 μg/mL). 
In the cynomolgus monkey tissue, moderate to high levels of background staining in connective 
tissue were present at both concentration levels for both T-DM1 and control article. The 
background staining was attributed to the secondary antibody (mouse anti-DM1), and this was 
confirmed by omitting T-DM1, and the background staining was similar. The presence of this 
background “noise” made it difficult to assess the presence of T-DM1 specific binding in the 
interstitial tissue components, however, as this was only the case for the cynomolgus tissue and 
not the human tissue, the clinical relevance was limited. 
The epithelial cells had primarily granular membrane staining with T-DM1, while spindle cells 
(presumptive nerve sheath/Schwann cells) had primarily cytoplasmic staining. Glial and 
mononuclear cells had both membrane and cytoplasmic staining. In general, epithelial and glial 
cell staining was greater in intensity than spindle cell staining. Ductal and apocrine gland 
epithelium stained with the greatest intensity and squamous epithelium with the least. Basal and 
basolateral cell surfaces stained more intensely than the apical cell surface.  
Epithelial and spindle cells were most frequently positive for T-DM1 binding, however, the 
monkey samples were less frequently positive compared to the human tissue samples. It was not 
possible to discern the reasons for these differences between the human and cynomolgus 
monkey samples, as the monkey samples had a relatively high degree of background staining, 
especially in the connective tissue, attributed to the secondary antibody (mouse anti-DM1).  
The positive spindle cells were often closely associated with peripheral nerve bundles and ganglia 
(presumptive Schwann cells). 
Thrombocytopenia: Mechanism of Action Investigation  
Effects of T-DM1 on platelet function and formation from haematopoietic stem cells were 
evaluated. While T-DM1 did not have a direct effect on the platelet function, it impaired 
megakaryocyte and platelet production. The findings in this study are consistent with the 
mechanism of action of DM1 as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerisation, and the critical role of 
microtubules in megacaryocyte integrity and platelet production. DM1-conjugated antibodies 
were internalised in a target independent, partially Fc-mediated manner into megakaryocytes 
and intracellular release of DM1 resulted in a reduction of the precursor megakaryocyte cell 
population. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
T-DM1 is readily degradable (84% in 28 days). Toxicity for algae, planktonic crustaceans 
(daphnids), fish (guppy) as well as inhibition of aerobic bacterial respiration was evaluated for T-
DM1 (according to OECD Nos. 201, 202, 203 semi static and 301 F respectively). The results are

As breast cancer on the whole and HER2-positive breast cancer in particular have lower 
prevalence than the default Fpen, a refinement based on the use of crude incidence rates 
reflecting the actual number of cases arising in a specific population with a given age-structure 
was considered appropriate. The Applicant used the highest reported crude incidence rate instead 
of the prevalence of breast cancer in Europe, which is 178.9 per 100,000 women (or 0.179%) 
and occurs in Belgium [International Agency for Research on Cancer online analysis, 
http://globocan.iarc.fr/, accessed April 14th 2011]. Extrapolating to the whole population, 
assuming 1) that there are 50% each of males and females and 2) that breast cancer incidence 
in males is only about 1% of that in females and can therefore be neglected, the overall 
prevalence of breast cancer in the whole European population is at most 0.09%. 
In addition, based on recent publications (Jones and Budzar (2009), Koeninki et al (2009), Parise 
et al (2009), Schmitt (2009), Aitken et al (2010), Davoli et al (2010), Lund et al (2010) and 
Reichmann et al (2010)) referring to the Europe and USA, there is a consensus that not more 
than 30% of breast cancer patients are HER2-positive. 
When factoring in the incidence of breast cancer in the whole European population as well as the 
fraction of HER2 positive cancer patients, the refined Fpen based on incidence for the whole 
theoretical T-DM1 patient group is 0.027% or 0.00027. Based on the Fpen refinement to 0.027% 
or 0.00027 (above) and on a maximum daily dose (MDD) of 252 mg T-DM1 (assuming a 70 kg 
body weight) applied only once every three weeks. In well-defined cases the MDD may be 
divided into the minimum number of days for one treatment period, which for T-DM1 is 21 days. 
Therefore, the theoretical initial surface water PEC for whole T-DM1 is PECsurfacewater = 1.62 
ng T-DM1/l. 
In the course of both human metabolism and bacterial degradation in wastewater treatment the 
major moiety by far (the trastuzumab antibody) will be removed. As MCC-DM1 (along with lys-
MCC-DM1) is the compound excreted by patients and released from sewage treatment into the 
environment, MCC-DM1 should be considered to better represent the environmental fate and 
effects of T-DM1. Making up just below 2% of the molecular mass of the whole T-DM1 molecule 
(an average 3.5 MCC-DM1 units are conjugated to one trastuzumab molecule) a realistic 
PECsurfacewater for MCC-DM1 is 0.0000324 μg MCC-DM1/l or 0.0324 ng MCC-DM1/l. Moreover, 
based on the logKOW at pH 5, 7 and 9, which is always below 1.5 with a maximum of 1.31 in 
one measurement at pH 7, MCC-DM1 is not predicted to bioaccumulate. 
In addition, both T-DM1 and MCC-DM1 were not inhibitory to the activated sludge bacteria in the 
respective ready and inherent  biodegradation tests at nominal initial concentrations of 20 mg/l 
respectively 30 mg/l. Back-calculating from the PECsurfacewater of 0.0324 ng MCC-DM1/l by 
applying the 10-fold default dilution factor results in a PECsewage treatment of 0.324 ng MCC-
DM1/l. Comparing this PECsewage treatment with the non-inhibitory concentrations, particularly

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Kadcyla, trastuzumab emtansine, is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate which contains 
the humanised anti-HER2 IgG1, trastuzumab, covalently linked to the microtubule inhibitor 
DM1 (a maytansine derivative). Conjugation of DM1 to trastuzumab confers selectivity of the 
cytotoxic agent for HER2-overexpressing tumour cells, thereby increasing intracellular delivery 
of DM1 directly to malignant cells. Upon binding to HER2, trastuzumab emtansine undergoes 
receptor-mediated internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation, resulting in release of 
DM1-containing cytotoxic catabolites (primarily lysine-MCC-DM1). 
Trastuzumab emtansine, like trastuzumab, binds to domain IV of the HER2 extracellular domain 
(ECD), as well as to Fcγ receptors and complement C1q. In addition, trastuzumab emtansine, 
like trastuzumab, inhibits shedding of the HER2 ECD, inhibits signalling through the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, and mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2.   
DM1, the cytotoxic component of trastuzumab emtansine, binds to tubulin. By inhibiting tubulin 
polymerization, both DM1 and trastuzumab emtansine cause cells to arrest in the G2/M phase 
of the cell cycle, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death. Results from in vitro cytotoxicity 
assays show that DM1 is 20-200 times more potent than taxanes and vinca alkaloids.  The 
MCC linker is designed to limit systemic release and increase targeted delivery of DM1, as 
demonstrated by detection of very low levels of free DM1 in plasma.

Administration of trastuzumab emtansine was well tolerated in rats and monkeys at doses up to 
20 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, corresponding to 2040 µg DM1/m2 in both species, which is 
approximately equivalent to the clinical dose of trastuzumab emtansine in patients.  In the GLP 
toxicity studies, with the exception of irreversible peripheral axonal toxicity (observed only in 
monkeys at  ≥ 10 mg/kg) and reproductive organ toxicity (observed only in rats at 60 mg/kg), 
partially or completely reversible dose dependent toxicities were identified in both animal 
models. Principal toxicities included liver (liver enzyme elevations) at  ≥ 20 mg/kg and  ≥ 10 
mg/kg, bone marrow (reduced platelet and white blood cell count)/hematologic at  ≥ 20 mg/kg 
and  ≥ 10 mg/kg, and lymphoid organs at  ≥ 20 mg/kg and  ≥ 3 mg/kg, in rat and monkey, 
respectively (see SmPC section 5.3). In view of these results, the highest non-severely toxic 
dose (HNSTD) in cynomolgus monkeys was 10 mg/kg for four injections every 3 weeks which 
was below the no observable adverse effect level in that species and below one-tenth of the 
severely toxic dose in rats, this information was used to determine a Phase I starting dose in 
humans. 
DM1 was aneugenic or clastogenic in an in vivo single-dose rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay at exposures that were comparable to mean maximum concentrations of DM1 measured 
in humans administered trastuzumab emtansine. DM1 was not mutagenic in an in vitro 
bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Dedicated fertility studies have not been conducted with trastuzumab emtansine. However, 
based on results from general animal toxicity studies, adverse effects on fertility can be 
expected (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Dedicated embryo-foetal development studies have not been conducted in animals with 
trastuzumab emtansine. Developmental toxicity of trastuzumab has been identified in the 
clinical setting although it was not predicted in the non-clinical program. In addition, 
developmental toxicity of maytansine has been identified in non-clinical studies which suggests 
that DM1, the microtubule-inhibiting cytotoxic maytansinoid component of trastuzumab 
emtansine, will be similarly teratogenic and potentially embryotoxic (see SmPC section 5.3). 
The antibody-drug-conjugate T-DM1 is metabolised in the body, and the antibody moiety 
(trastuzumab) will not reach the environment. On the other hand, the drug part of the 
conjugate will reach the environment, and therefore the partition coefficient between octanol 
and water (logKow) was determined for both the intact antibody-drug-conjugate and the 
metabolite MCC-DM1. For both T-DM1 and also SMCC-DM1 (the excreted metabolite) 
PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
logKow does not exceed 4.5. 
As the PECsurfacewater for both T-DM1 and MCC-DM1have been determined to be smaller than 
the 0.01 μg/L threshold as well as the logKow for MCC-DM1was smaller than the 4.5 limit, 
there is no need for any further studies on environmental safety. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements (see SmPC section 6.6).

Absorption  
Trastuzumab emtansine is administered intravenously. There have been no studies performed 
with other routes of administration.  
The PK parameters of trastuzumab emtansine administered at 3.6 mg/kg q3w in each of these 
studies are summarized in the table below. Patients in TDM4370g/BO21977 who received 
3.6 mg/kg of trastuzumab emtansine intravenously every 3 weeks had a mean maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax) of trastuzumab emtansine of 83.4 (± 16.5) µg/mL. Based on population PK 
analysis, following intravenous administration, the central volume of distribution of trastuzumab 
emtansine was (3.13 L) and approximated that of plasma volume.

Mean clearance values ranged from 7 to 13 mL/day/kg, the volume of distribution was limited to 
the plasma volume, and terminal half-life was approximately 4 days. 
PK Parameters of Trastuzumab Emtansine Conjugate Following 3.6 mg/kg Administered 
Intravenously to Patients on an Every-3-Week Regimen 
The development of trastuzumab emtansine has been based solely on intravenous 
administration, therefore no BA studies were conducted and the bioavailability is expected to be 
100%. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) of trastuzumab emtansine observed 
across the six clinical studies in which the drug was administered  at 3.6 mg/kg q3w, ranged 
from 28.4 mL/kg and 58.4 mL/kg after the first trastuzumab emtansine dose (Cycle 1) and 
from 33.3 mL/kg and 43.6 mL/kg at steady state (see table above). 
Biotransformation (trastuzumab emtansine and DM1) 
Trastuzumab emtansine is expected to undergo deconjugation and catabolism by means of 
proteolysis in cellular lysosomes.  
In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes suggest that DM1 is metabolised mainly 
by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5. DM1 did not inhibit major CYP450 enzymes in 
vitro.  In human plasma, trastuzumab emtansine catabolites MCC-DM1, Lys-MCC-DM1, and 
DM1 were detected at low levels.  In vitro, DM1 was a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Elimination 
Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following intravenous administration of 
trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the clearance 
of trastuzumab emtansine was 0.68 L/day and the elimination half-life (t1/2) was

EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
 
 
  
  
approximately 4 days. No accumulation of trastuzumab emtansine was observed after repeated 
dosing of intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
Based on population PK analysis, body weight, albumin, sum of longest diameter of target 
lesions by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), HER2 shed extracellular 
domain (ECD), baseline trastuzumab concentrations, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
were identified as statistically significant covariates for trastuzumab emtansine PK parameters. 
However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on trastuzumab emtansine exposure, 
suggests that with the exception of body weight, these covariates are unlikely to have any 
clinically meaningful effect on trastuzumab emtansine exposure. In addition, exploratory 
analysis showed that the impact of covariates (i.e., renal function, race and age) on the 
pharmacokinetics of total trastuzumab and DM1 was limited and was not clinically relevant. In 
nonclinical studies, trastuzumab emtansine catabolites including DM1, Lys-MCC-DM1, and 
MCC-DM1 are mainly excreted in the bile with minimal elimination in urine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
One dose-escalating study was performed in T-DM1 (Study TDM3569g) where 6 doses q3w and 
5 doses qw was assessed. Serum T-DM1 concentrations decreased, with a mean terminalphase 
half-life (t1/2) ranging from 1.3 to 4.1 days across the dose levels tested. No significant 
accumulation was observed with q3w dosing of T-DM1. Systemic exposure, as measured by 
Cmax and AUC, increased with increasing dose. Assessment of dose linearity was limited by the 
small number of patients evaluated, especially at doses below 2.4 mg/kg q3w. The volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) of T-DM1 approximated the physiologic serum volume, and 
did not appear to change considerably with dose. Study JO22591 was a dose escalating study 
that investigated the PK of 3 doses of T-DM1 (1.8, 2.4 and 3.6 mg/kg q3w). Results from 
JO22591 concluded that the pharmacokinetics of serum RO5304020 (T-DM1) and serum total 
trastuzumab was linear when the dose of RO5304020 (T-DM1) was in the range of 1.8 to 3.6 
mg/kg. 
PK-parameter values were obtained in cycle 1 and in cycle 3, 4 or 5, depending on study 
(TDM3569g; TDM4258g; TDM374g; TDM688g; TDM4450g; TDM4370g). For both total 
trastuzumab, conjugated T-DM1 and DM1, no relevant accumulation was observed. Also no 
change in T-DM1 PK parameters was observed from cycle 1 to subsequent cycles across 
studies. 
In conclusion, Trastuzumab emtansine when administered intravenously every 3 weeks 
exhibited linear PK across doses ranging from 2.4 to 4.8 mg/kg; patients who received doses 
less than or equal to 1.2 mg/kg had faster clearance. 
Special populations 
No formal PK study has been conducted in patients with renal impairment. The population PK 
analysis showed that creatinine clearance does not affect the PK of trastuzumab emtansine. 
Pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with mild (creatinine clearance CLcr 60 
to 89 mL/min, n = 254) or moderate (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min, n = 53) renal impairment were 
similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min, n = 361). 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 41/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
  
  
Pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) are 
limited (n = 1), therefore no dosage recommendations can be made. 
No formal PK study has been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.  
The population PK analysis showed that race did not appear to influence the PK of trastuzumab 
emtansine. Because most of the patients in trastuzumab emtansine clinical studies were 
females, the effect of gender on the PK of trastuzumab emtansine was not formally evaluated. 
The pharmacokinetics of T-DM1 was best described in the population pharmacokinetics analysis 
by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment. The 
estimated clearance was 0.676 L/day, the central volume of distribution 3.127 L and 
elimination half-life 3.94 days. T-DM1 reached steady state concentrations within one 
treatment cycle. Body weight, albumin, sum of longest diameter of target lesions by Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), HER2 shed extracellular domain (ECD), baseline 
trastuzumab concentrations, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were identified as 
statistically significant covariates for trastuzumab emtansine PK parameters. However, with the 
exception of body weight, the magnitude of effect of these covariates was small and unlikely to 
have any clinically meaningful effect on trastuzumab emtansine exposure. In addition, 
exploratory analysis showed that the impact of renal function, race and age on the 
pharmacokinetics of total trastuzumab and DM1 was limited and was not clinically relevant.  
The population PK analysis showed that age did not affect the PK of trastuzumab emtansine. No 
significant difference was observed in the PK of trastuzumab emtansine among patients < 65 
years (n = 577), patients between 65-75 years (n = 78) and patients > 75 years (n = 16). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No clinical interaction studies were performed. T-DM1 is expected to undergo catabolism by 
means of proteolysis in cellular lysosomes, with no significant involvement of CYP enzymes. As 
such, T-DM1 pharmacokinetics is unlikely to be affected by concomitant medications that are CYP 
inhibitors and inducers. 
In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes suggest that DM1, a component of 
trastuzumab emtansine, is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A5.   
In-vitro studies showed that for concentrations up to 600 ng/ml DM1 did not induce or inhibit 
CYP metabolism.  
DM1 is a P-gp substrate and not an inhibitor at 369 µg/ml and the highest Cmax measured in 
clinical studies was 59.7 ng/ml (see pharmacokinetics using biomaterials). .  In human plasma, 
trastuzumab emtansine catabolites MCC-DM1, Lys-MCC-DM1, and DM1 were detected at low 
levels. 
A sensitivity analysis from the pivotal study TDM4370g/BO21977 showed that Cmax, AUC and 
clearance for T-DM1, total trastuzumab and DM1 were unaffected by concomitant medication 
with CYP3A inducers, CYP3 inhibitors, P-gp inhibitors and others (others = not CYP3A inhibitors, 
CYP3A inducers, or P-gp inhibitors). Also preliminary results from ongoing studies showed no

change in PK parameters for T-DM1, total trastuzumab, DM1, docetaxel, paclitaxel, and 
pertuzumab when co-administered. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes suggest that DM1, a catabolite of T-DM1, 
is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A5. DM1 did not induce and/or 
inhibit CYP-mediated metabolism at concentrations up to 600 ng/mL. In addition, an in vitro 
metabolism experiment showed that DM1 is a substrate of P-gp and not an inhibitor of P-gp 
when tested at 0.5 μM (369 μg/mL). Currently available data show that clinical DM1 levels do not 
exceed 59.7 ng/mL.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Exposure-safety evaluation was performed with the pooled patient population from 5 studies 
and for the pivotal study alone. In both groups evaluated, no associations of Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity adverse events and T-DM1 AUC and Cmax, total 
trastuzumab AUC, or DM1 Cmax were seen. Furthermore there were no associations of 
quartiles of T-DM1 AUC and Cmax, total Trastuzumab AUC and DM1 Cmax and values of ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin and platelet counts. 
Immunogenicity 
Of all patients treated with T-DM1, a total of 836 patients from six studies had at least one post-
dose ATA timepoint evaluable for ATA response. Overall, confirmed positive ATA responses were 
detected in 44 of 836 (5.3%) patients across the six studies; 28 of these patients had negative 
baseline samples.  Positive responses in all 44 patients were confirmed and characterized by 
competitive binding immunodepletion with T-DM1 and trastuzumab. The majority (37 of 44) of 
patients had a positive response immunodepleted by T-DM1 only. The positive response from 
one or more timepoints from 6 patients was immunodepletable by both T-DM1 and trastuzumab, 
and the response from 1 patient was immunodepleted by trastuzumab only. 
The clinical significance of antibody development against T-DM1 is unknown; however, the 
impact of ATA response on pharmacokinetics was assessed. There was no obvious change in the 
pharmacokinetics of patients who tested ATA positive to T-DM1 when compared with data from 
patients who tested ATA negative. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies about the mechanism of action of T-DM1 were submitted 
(see Non-clinical pharmacodynamics).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
QTc interval 
A dedicated single arm QTc study (TDM4688g; N=51) was conducted in the target patient 
population, at the intended marketed dose regimen. The primary objective of Study TDM4688g, 
a multicenter, single-arm study in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer, was to evaluate the effect of T-DM1 on the duration of the QTc interval. QTc 
interval was measured as change from baseline to selected timepoints following T-DM1 
administration, calculated using QTcF. Overall, no patients had a QTc interval > 480 ms and only 
2 patients had changes from baseline QTc of more than 30 seconds (corrected with Bazetts 
formula). Mean baseline-adjusted average QTcF interval showed that the upper bound of the 
90% two-sided CI did not exceed 10 ms, as recommended in the Guidance for industry: E14 
Clinical evaluation on QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrythmic potential for non-arrythmic 
drugs. The exploratory concentration-QTc analysis showed a trend between T-DM1, total 
trastuzumab and DM1 concentrations and QTc interval prolongation. However, at the observed 
concentration ranges of T-DM1, total trastuzumab and DM1,  the upper bound of the 95% one-
sided CI did not exceed 10 ms. In conclusion administration of T-DM1 was not shown to result in 
any significant QTc prolongation. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was adequately investigated and sufficiently 
characterised. DM1 was detected in human plasma, as a result of cleavage from trastuzumab 
emtansine.  
A Population PK analysis was performed, which identified several covariates with a significant 
effect on Poplation PK parameters. Yet, with the exception of body weight. the impact of these 
identified covariate on exposure was low. Body weight based dose of 3.6 mg/kg every 3 week 
withtout correction for other covariates is considered appropriate.  
Elderly patients  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that age does not have a clinically meaningful 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine. There are insufficient data to provide 
dosing recommendations in patients ≥ 75 years due to limited data in this subgroup, therefore 
no dose adjustment is proposed in the SmPC.  
Renal impairment 
The T-DM1 derived DM1 and metabolites MCC-DM1 and lys-MCC-DM1 has only been partially 
characterised in humans. However, the concentration of DM1 were always low, often lower than 
the LLOQ, which precluded a formal PK analysis. The impact of renal impairment on the PK of T-
DM1 was investigated through a Population PK analysis. The results showed a lack of effect of 
renal impairment on the exposure to T-DM1, which is consistent with the protein moiety of drug 
being eliminated by ubiquitary proteolysis.  The nonclinical data, a mass balance study in rats, 
and exploratory PK analyses in patients with and without renal impairment in Study TDM4688g 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 44/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
  
  
suggest that renal impairment has a minimal effect on the exposure to the DM1-containing 
catabolites, namely MCC-DM1 and Lys-MCC-DM1.  
No adjustment to the starting dose is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(see section SmPC 5.2). The potential need for dose adjustment in patients with severe renal 
impairment cannot be determined due to insufficient data and therefore patients with severe 
renal impairment should be monitored carefully. 
A dedicated study of the PK of trastuzumab emtansine and relevant catabolites in MBC patients 
with mild to moderate hepatic impairment is ongoing (see Risk-management plan). 
Hepatic impairment 
Liver function should be monitored prior to initiation of treatment and each dose (see SmPC 
section 4.4 and RMP). Patients with baseline elevation of ALT (e.g due to liver metastases) may 
be predisposed to liver injury with a higher risk of a Grade 3-5 hepatic event or liver function test 
increase.   Dose reductions or discontinuation for increased serum transaminases and total 
bilirubin are specified in section 4.2. 
Interactions 
The potential for interaction has been sufficiently investigated. In vitro metabolism studies in 
human liver microsomes suggest that DM1 is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser 
extent, by CYP3A5. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, and voriconazole) with trastuzumab emtansine should be avoided due to the 
potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity.  Consider an alternate medicinal product 
with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is 
unavoidable, consider delaying trastuzumab emtansine treatment until the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors have cleared from the circulation (approximately 3 elimination half-lives of the 
inhibitors) when possible.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is coadministered and trastuzumab 
emtansine treatment cannot be delayed, patients should be closely monitored for adverse 
reactions.

The applicant will submit the results from a dedicated study of the PK of trastuzumab emtansine 
and relevant catabolites in MBC patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (BO25499

MCC-DM1 (PRO132365) Administered Intravenously to Patients with HER2-Positive Metastatic 
Breast Cancer Who Have Previously Received a Trastuzumab-Containing Regimen. Approximately 
four centers in the United States were to participate in the study to enrol approximately 50-60 
patients.  
Cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the relevant species for toxicology studies designed to 
determine a Phase I starting dose as discussed in the non-clinical aspects. The highest non-
severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in cynomolgus monkeys was 10 mg/kg for four injections every 3 
weeks (equivalent to 120 mg/m2 when the dose was calculated using a body surface area 
conversion factor of 0.32 to convert cynomolgus monkey dose levels [mg/kg] to equivalent 
human dose levels [mg/kg]), which was below the no observable adverse effect level in that 
species and below one-tenth of the severely toxic dose in rats. The proposed starting dose in 
humans was 0.3 mg/kg body weight (equivalent to 10 mg/m2 body surface area).  
Between 25 April 2006 and 20 May 2008, 54 patients were enrolled (26 and 28 patients in the 
q3w and qw cohorts, respectively) and 52 were treated. 
The median treatment duration was 16.7 weeks in the q3w cohorts and 18.9 weeks in the qw 
cohorts. T-DM1 was generally well tolerated. No Grade > 1 nausea, vomiting, alopecia, 
neuropathy, or LVEF decline has been observed with the every-three-week schedule. No Grade > 
1 LVEF decline has been observed with the weekly schedule.  
Two patients at the 4.8 mg/kg dose level in the every-three-week cohorts had DLTs in the first 
cycle of treatment. Both were Grade 4 non serious thrombocytopenia. One patient at the 2.4 
mg/kg dose level in the weekly cohorts had a DLT of Grade 2, nonserious thrombocytopenia that 
prevented re-treatment on Cycle 1, Day 8. Two patients at the 2.9 mg/kg dose level in the 
weekly cohorts had DLTs. One patient had Grade 3, non-serious thrombocytopenia that 
prevented re-treatment on Cycle 1 Day 8, and one patient had a laboratory abnormality Grade 3 
elevated AST on Cycle 1, Day 2 that prompted the investigator to hold therapy on Cycle 1, Day 
8. This patient was permitted to continue study treatment on Cycle 2 Day 1 per protocol and 
discontinued during Cycle 2 because of progressive disease. The MTDs for the every-three-week 
and weekly cohorts were 3.6 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg, respectively. 
The most common adverse events in the weekly cohort were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and 
aspartate aminotransferase increased. The most common adverse events in the every-three-
week cohort were thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and nausea. Thrombocytopenia was the most 
frequent adverse event in the every-three-week cohorts and a key DLT in both the every-three-
week and weekly cohorts. Reversible elevations in hepatic transaminases were observed. Most of 
these elevations were mild to moderate in severity.  
In the q3w cohorts, 5 of 24 treated patients had an objective partial response (ORR = 21%). 
Four responses occurred in the 3.6 mg/kg cohort, and one occurred in the 2.4 mg/kg cohort. Of 
the 15 patients that received the 3.6 mg/kg qw MTD, there were 9 patients with measurable 
disease of whom 4 achieved an objective partial response (ORR = 44 %). The median duration of 
response was 10.5 months (range, 1.7 + to 26.3 + months). Seven patients had stable disease 
longer than 6 months. The 6-month clinical benefit rate was 50%. Two patients have completed 
the study and transferred to the extension study TDM4259g.

In the qw cohorts, 13 of 28 treated patients had an objective partial response (ORR = 46%). Six 
responses occurred in 2.4 mg/kg cohort, two in the 2.0 mg/kg cohort, two in the 1.6 mg/kg 
cohort, and three in the 1.2 mg/kg cohort. Of the 16 patients that received the 2.4 mg/kg qw 
MTD, there were 15 patients with measurable disease of whom 6 achieved an objective partial 
response (ORR = 44%). The median duration of response was 18.6 months (range, 1.4 + −19.1 
+ months). Three patients had stable disease longer than 6 months; the 6-month clinical benefit 
rate was 57%. Six patients have completed the study and three were enrolled in the extension 
study TDM4259g.  
The Phase II study, TDM4258g, showed similar tolerability at the 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
(q3w) dose level, with only a small percentage of patients (3 of 112 patients) requiring dose 
reduction. Thus, the T-DM1 dose of 3.6 mg/kg q3w was selected for testing in the phase III 
study TDM4370g/BO21977 based on the comparable efficacy and safety of the two regimens and 
convenience of a 3-week regimen for this patient population. 
A formal dose-response analysis was not possible due to the limited number of patients in the 
dose escalating study. Results from the exposure-response analysis with patients from the 
pivotal study TDM4370g/BO21977 showed that for OR, PFS and OS, no association of T-DM1 
AUC, T-DM1 Cmax, to total trastuzumab AUC and DM1 Cmax, when splitting the data in below 
and above median. Also the responder probability was not associated with of T-DM1 AUC, T-DM1 
Cmax, to total trastuzumab AUC and DM1 Cmax. Similar results were seen in patients who were 
pretreated with HER2-directed therapies and in those not pretreated, suggesting that the 
response is independent of prior therapy.

Treatments 
Control arm (lapatinib + capecitabine): Lapatinib 1250 mg/day orally with continuous daily 
dosing on a 3-week cycle + Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on Days 1−14 of a 3-
week cycle 
Tratuzumab emtansine arm: Trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of a 
3-week cycle. 
Study treatment was administered on a 3-week cycle and treatment continued until disease 
progression (PD) or unmanageable toxicity.  
The initial dose of tratuzumab emtansine was to be administered over 90 minutes (± 10 
minutes). Infusions could be be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencing infusion-
associated symptoms. Vital signs had to be be assessed pre-dose and post-dose. Following the 
initial dose, patients were to be observed for at least 90 minutes for fever, chills, or other 
infusion-associated symptoms. If prior infusions were well tolerated (without any signs or 
symptoms of infusion reactions), subsequent doses of trastuzumab emtansine could be 
administered over 30 minutes (± 10 minutes), with a minimum 30-minute observation period 
after infusion. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives for this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
To compare the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine versus capecitabine plus lapatinib in 
patients with HER2-positive, unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer or MBC as 
measured by PFS on the basis of an independent review of tumor assessments; 
To compare the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine versus capecitabine plus lapatinib in 
patients with HER2-positive, unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer or MBC as 
measured by overall survival (OS) and to assess landmark (1-year and 2-year) survival rates 
within each treatment group, as appropriate; 
To assess the safety of trastuzumab emtansine relative to the safety of capecitabine plus 
lapatinib. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
PFS and OS were co-primary efficacy endpoints for this study: 
• 
PFS by IRC assessment, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of 
progression, as determined by independent review of tumor assessments through use of 
modified RECIST {Therasse, 2000 #1593}(see Table below), or death from any cause;

•  OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause; 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
•  Objective tumor response (determined primarily by independent review of tumor 
assessments using modified RECIST); only patients with measurable disease at baseline were 
included in the analysis. Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered 
non-responders. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients 
with CR or PR. 
• 
• 
Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined as time from randomization to discontinuation of 
treatment for any reason. In the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm, a patient was considered to 
have failed treatment only if both drugs were discontinued; the later of the two 
discontinuation dates was used as the treatment failure date if the two drugs were 
discontinued at different dates. 
Time to symptom progression (defined as the time from randomization to the first 
documentation of a ≥ 5-point decrease from baseline in the scoring of responses) was 
measured by patients’ answers to questions in FACT-B TOI-PFB in the two treatment groups. 
The TOI-PFB is a subset of the FACT-B and includes the Physical, Functional and Breast 
subscales. Only patients with a baseline assessment and at least one follow-up assessment 
were included in this analysis. Analysis of time to symptom progression in the randomized 
population was based on female patients only. Data for patients who did not have an 
observed symptom progression at the time of data cutoff were censored at the last observed 
TOI-PFB assessment date. Patients without post-baseline TOI-PFB assessments were 
censored at the time of randomization plus 1 day.

Overall Response 
At screening, tumor lesions will be categorized as follows: 
On spiral CT, for images with lesions with a reconstruction interval of less than or equal to 5 mm, the 
minimum measurable lesion size will be 10 mm; if the reconstruction interval on spiral CT is greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum lesion size will be double the reconstruction interval. On conventional CT 
or MRI, for images with lesions with a reconstruction interval of less than or equal to 10 mm, the 
minimum measurable lesion size will be 20 mm; if the reconstruction interval on conventional CT or 
MRI is greater than 10 mm, the minimum lesion size will be double the reconstruction interval. 
Nonmeasurable lesions will include all other lesions, including small lesions and truly 
nonmeasurable lesions. Brain imaging acquired at screening or follow-up or an unscheduled 
timepoint will undergo radiology review. Brain lesions will be assessed as non-target lesions. Any 
brain lesions identified by the investigator sites will be taken into consideration by the oncologist in 
his/her assessment. 
The radiologists will limit measurement of target lesions to CT and MRI scans, the best currently 
available and most reproducible methods. 
In the face of an enlarging effusion/ascites with no progressive non-target disease elsewhere, the 
radiologist will record tumor response for nontarget lesions as Unknown. New pleural 
effusion/ascites will be recorded as a new lesion but will not result in an overall response of PD for 
the timepoint. The oncologist will assign a response according to clinical data (e.g., cytological 
results). 
Per protocol all subjects included in the study will be assessed, even if there are no measurable/target 
lesions as assessed by the radiologists. 
If a target lesion becomes less than 5 mm, but is still clearly present, a measurement of 5 mm will be 
assigned to the longest diameter and the SLD of target lesions will continue to be generated. 
If Target Lesion Response is CR, but Non-Target Lesion Response is Unknown and there are no 
new lesions, the overall timepoint response will be PR. If Target Lesion Response is PR, but Non-
Target Lesion Response is Unknown and there are no new lesions, the overall timepoint response 
will be PR. If Target Lesion Response is SD, but Non-Target Lesion Response is Unknown and 
there are no new lesions, the overall timepoint response will be SD.

Sample size 
The sample size of the study was determined by the analysis of OS. To detect a HR of 0.8 in OS 
(a 25% improvement in median OS; i.e., from 17.2 months in the control arm to 21.5 months in 
the treatment arm), approximately 632 events were required to achieve 80% power at a two-
sided 5% alpha level. A total of 980 patients were to be enrolled into the study over 
approximately 35 month. The primary analysis of PFS was to take place when approximately 508 
IRC-assessed PFS events had occurred. This provides 90% power to detect an HR of 0.75 in PFS 
(a 33% improvement in median PFS; i.e., from 6.2 months in the control arm to 8.3 months in 
the treatment arm), with a two-sided alpha of 5%. The final analysis of PFS would not be 
conducted until the last patient was enrolled.  
Randomisation 
Upon verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to 
either trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib + capecitabine using a hierarchical dynamic 
randomization procedure. The randomization scheme was designed to ensure approximately 
equal sample sizes for the treatment arms within each category of (in this order) 1) world region 
(United States, Western Europe, other), 2) number of prior chemotherapeutic regimens for 
locally advanced or metastatic disease (0−1 vs. >1), 3) visceral vs. non-visceral disease, and 
overall. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was not blinded. 
Statistical methods 
To control for multiplicity due to having two primary endpoints, a fixed-sequence hypothesis 
testing procedure was implemented. The hypothesis test for PFS was conducted at a one-sided 
alpha of 2.5%. If the PFS was statistically different between the two arms, OS was to be tested 
at a one-sided alpha of 2.5%.  If the primary endpoints of PFS (based upon independent review 
of tumor assessments) and OS were statistically significant, the secondary endpoints were to be 
tested in the following order: PFS (based upon investigator assessment), response rate (based 
upon independent review of tumor assessments), time to treatment failure, and time to 
symptom progression.

disease (0-1 vs. > 1), and visceral versus non-visceral disease was used as the primary analysis 
to compare PFS between the two treatment arms. 
There was no interim analysis of PFS. An interim analysis of OS was planned to be conducted at 
the same time as the final analysis of PFS. At the interim analysis, OS would be tested at the 
significance level determined using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-
Fleming boundary, so that the overall two-sided Type I error rate would be maintained at the 5% 
level. The final analysis of OS was to be performed when 632 deaths have occurred.  
In the original statistical analysis plan, no further interim analyses of OS were planned. However, 
in light of the large effect observed at the time of the primary PFS analysis, the applicant 
planned a second interim analysis for OS (when at least 50% of the target number of events had 
occurred).  The cut-off date for this analysis was 31 July 2012. The 2nd OS interim analysis was 
added after observing a positive trend in OS improvement in the 1st interim analysis. The Lan-
DeMets alpha spending function O’B-F boundary was used. 
The analysis population to be used for the primary analysis of PFS was to be the randomized 
population, defined as all patients who were randomized into the study ≥ 3 months prior to the 
clinical data cutoff date for the final PFS analysis, regardless of whether they received any study 
treatment. All other efficacy endpoints were to be analyzed using the randomized population with 
two exceptions: 1) the analysis of objective response rate will only include patients in the 
randomized population who have measurable disease at baseline and 2) the analysis of duration 
of response will include only patients who were in the randomized population and who also 
achieved an objective response to study treatment. For all efficacy analyses, patients were to be 
counted towards the treatment group to which they were randomized.

Recruitment 
A total of 1474 patients were screened for the study, and 991 eligible patients were enrolled 
from 213 centers in 26 countries (Brazil, Canada, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Finland, 
Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Bulgaria, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, 
Republic of Korea, Republic of the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Chinese Hong 
Kong, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, India, United States). The first patient was 
randomized on 23 February 2009 and the last patient was randomized on 13 October 2011. The 
country with the highest enrollment was the US (270 patients). The other top recruiting countries 
were South Korea, Canada, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Italy; each country recruited 
more than 50 patients. Individual centers recruited between one and 33 patients but the majority 
of centers (155 of 213) recruited fewer than 5 patients. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was issued on 8 October 2008 and amended three times. The key changes to the 
protocol included specification of interim OS analysis; definition of PFS (include all deaths, 
beyond the initial limit of 30 days after the last dose of study treatment); OS specified as co-
primary (instead of secondary) endpoint; sample size increased from 580 to 980 (powered for 
OS analysis).

Median time to event variable was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratio relative to Lapatinib+Capecitabine group and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for hazard ratio were estimated using Cox regression. 
The vertical dashed line indicates the hazard ratio for all patients. 
The diameter of the circle is proportional to the square root of the total number of subjects. 
The hazard ratios are from unstratified analysis. Baseline disease measurability and number of disease sites are based on IRC assessment. 
Database (CLOSED cutoff: 31JUL2012) 
In study TDM4370g/BO21977, consistent treatment benefit of trastuzumab emtansine was seen 
in the majority of pre-specified subgroups evaluated, supporting the robustness of the overall 
result.  
No prior systemic anti-cancer therapy in the metastatic setting

EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
A treatment benefit was seen in the subgroup of patients who had relapsed within 6 months of 
completing adjuvant treatment  and had not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapy in 
the metastatic setting (n=118); hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.51 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) 
and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.16), respectively. The median PFS and OS for the trastuzumab 
emtansine group were 10.8 months and not reached, respectively, compared with 5.7 months 
and 27.9 months, respectively, for the lapatinib plus capecitabine group.  
Hormone receptor status 
In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (n=426), the hazard ratios 
for PFS and OS were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.72) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.03), respectively.  In 
the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (n=545), the hazard ratios for 
PFS and OS were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.91) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively.   
Baseline disease measurability 
In the subgroup of patients with non-measurable disease (n=205), based on IRC assessments, 
the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.42) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.54, 
1.68), respectively.  
Elderly patients 
In the subgroup of patients who were 65 to 74 years old (n=113), based on IRC assessments, 
the hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.45) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.37, 
1.47), respectively.  For patients 75 years or above, based on IRC assessments, the hazard 
ratios for PFS and OS were 3.51 (95% CI: 1.22, 10.13) and 3.45 (95% CI: 0.94, 12.65), 
respectively. The subgroup of patients 75 years or above did not demonstrate a benefit for PFS 
or OS, but was too small (n=25) to draw any definitive conclusions.   
Non-visceral disease 
There was a less impressive effect in patients with non-visceral disease, and a similar finding was 
seen for pertuzumab (data not shown). However, this was based solely on the study site 
classification at the time of randomization for which explicit guidance had not been provided (the 
applicant had expectations that sites/investigators had adequate knowledge of visceral and non-
visceral disease definitions). The sites of disease involvement have been subsequently reviewed 
according to IRC data, and further PFS (based on IRC assessments, data cut-off 14 January 
2012) and OS (data cut-off 31 July 2012) subgroup analyses have been conducted using baseline 
IRC tumor assessments and applying the following two definitions of visceral disease (a) vs. non-
visceral disease (b): 
Definition 1: a) Presence of disease in the lungs or liver (either target or non- target lesions) vs. 
b) absence of disease in both the lungs and liver 
Definition 2: a) Presence of disease in the lungs or liver or ascites or pleural effusion (either 
target or non-target lesions) vs. b) absence of disease in all these 4 sites 
When the IRC data are used and the revised classifications applied, a benefit of trastuzumab 
emtansine compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine was observed for patients with disease 
that did not involve visceral organs. 
Additional analyses were performed to evaluate the safety of patients with non-visceral disease 
according to Definition 2b. The incidence of deaths, SAEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs and all AEs in

the trastuzumab emtansine arm were consistently lower than in the control arm, and there was 
no evidence of detriment associated with use of trastuzumab emtansine over lapatinib plus 
capecitabine. 
Patients with Brain Metastases 
Patients with treated brain metastases not requiring therapy to control symptoms were included 
and treated in the pivotal phase III trial. No difference was seen in PFS was observed but a clear 
benefit in favor of T-DM1 was seen with regard to OS.  
Study TDM4370g/BO21977: OS in Patients with CNS Disease at Baseline 
Immunogenicity (Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies, ATA) 
In TDM4370g/BO21977 (EMILIA), positive ATA responses were detected in 20 of 460 ATA 
evaluable patients (4.3%) at one or more post-dosing time points. A lower median progression-
free survival (PFS) was observed in the 20 ATA positive patients compared to the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population (5.6 vs 9.6 months) while objective response rates were comparable.

Biomarker Analyses 
The candidate biomarkers evaluated in Study TDM4370g/BO21977 were selected according to 
their function within the HER2 signaling pathway and/or impact on mode of action of 
trastuzumab emtansine (based upon existing nonclinical data and/or reports in the literature 
for HER2-targeted treatments, as well as the availability of appropriate assays). Markers 
included expression of HER-family receptors and ligands (EGFR, HER2, HER3 amphiregulin and 
betacellulin) and markers/components of the HER signal transduction or alternative signaling 
pathways (PTEN protein expression, mutational status of PIK3CA).   
No biomarkers that clearly differentiated patient response could be identified from exploratory 
analyses of PFS, splitting patient subgroups by high (above median) and low (median and 
below) levels of mRNA expression for biomarkers analyzed, although slight differences were 
observed for HER3. Among all randomized patients, HER3 qRT-PCR data were available for 
860 patients (424 patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm and 436 patients in the lapatinib 
plus capecitabine arm). In patients whose tumors showed HER3 expression at or below the 
median (median = 0.438), the HR was 0.56 (95%CI = 0.45, 0.74). Median PFS was 5.7 
months in the control arm and 9.3 months in the trastuzumab emtansine group. In patients 
whose tumors had HER3 expression above the median level, HR was 0.80 (95%CI = 0.62, 
1.04). The median PFS was 6.9 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group and 9.8 
months in the trastuzumab emtansine group.

Study TDM4374g 
Study TDM4374g was a Phase II single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive MBC. 
Trastuzumab emtansine was administered intravenously at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
Patients remained on study treatment until documented PD or unacceptable toxicity. At study 
closure, patients who continued to derive benefit from treatment with trastuzumab emtansine

trastuzumab emtansine in patients previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine in a 
Genentech-sponsored trastuzumab emtansine study). Tumor assessments were performed every 
6 weeks. An IRC reviewed and assessed all patient scans and tumor response data. 
Key inclusion criteria: Histologically documented MBC with measurable disease, HER2-positive 
documented as FISH positive or 3+ on IHC, with disease progression on the last regimen 
received; prior treatment with an anthracycline, trastuzumab, a taxane, lapatinib, and 
capecitabine in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, locally advanced, or metastatic setting and prior 
treatment with at least two regimens of therapy (a regimen of therapy could have been a 
combination of two or more agents or a single agent) in the metastatic or locally advanced 
setting; prior treatment with at least two anti-HER2 agents in the metastatic setting or 
unresectable locally advanced setting. The HER2-targeted agents must have included 
trastuzumab and lapatinib, but in addition may also have included an investigational agent with 
HER2-inhibitory activity; a minimum of 6 weeks of trastuzumab for the treatment of metastatic 
or unresectable locally advanced disease; at least 14 days of exposure in the metastatic (or 
unresectable locally advanced) setting to lapatinib and capecitabine (given together or 
separately) unless patients were intolerant of lapatinib and/or capecitabine. 
The study population was predominantly white (93/110 patients, 84.5%) with median age of 
52.5 years (range: 34 – 77), and included two male patients (1.8%). As per protocol, most 
patients had an ECOG PS of 0 (49.1%) or 1 (48.2%); three patients (2.7%) had an ECOG PS of 
2. All patients (except 1 patient) had HER2-positive disease by local laboratory assessment (3+ 
IHC and/or HER2 gene amplification determined on FISH): 23.6% of tumors were HER2 positive 
by both FISH and IHC, 45.5% by IHC alone, and 30.0% by FISH alone.  
The majority of patients presented with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (81.7%); 8.3% with 
infiltrating lobular carcinoma and 17.4% with other histologies. At initial diagnosis, half of the 
patients’ tumors were estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive. 
At study entry, all patients had measurable disease (median sum of the longest dimension was 
6.8 cm (range: 1.0 – 34.0) and had significant disease burden with 73.6% of them presenting 
with disease involvement in three or more sites. The most frequently involved sites with 
metastatic disease were lung (62.7%), bone (51.8%), and liver (44.5%). Nineteen patients 
(17.3%) had a history of CNS metastases; all but one of them had received whole-brain 
radiotherapy or localized therapy.  
Patients had been heavily pretreated as demonstrated by the median number of prior anti-cancer 
agents in any setting, 8.5 (range: 5 -19), and in the metastatic setting, 7.0 (range: 3 – 17). All 
patients had received trastuzumab, lapatinib, capecitabine and an anthracycline prior to study 
entry and all but one had previously been treated with a taxane. About half of the patients 
(47.3%) had previously received hormone therapy. Patients had received a median of 2 prior 
trastuzumab-containing regimens (range: 1 - 8) for metastatic disease with a median duration of 
19.7 months (range: 1.8 – 115.8). In addition, patients received a median of 1 
lapatinib-containing regimen for MBC (range: 1 – 3) for a median duration of 6.8 months. The 
majority of patients (94%) had progressed on at least one HER2-based regimen in the metastatic 
setting and 66% had progressed on both a trastuzumab- and a lapatinib-containing combination 
regimen in the metastatic setting.

Study TDM4258g 
Study TDM4258g was a Phase II single-arm, open-label study of trastuzumab emtansine 
administered intravenously in patients with HER2-positive MBC who have progressed while 
receiving HER2-directed therapy. 
In this study, trastuzumab emtansine was administered at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg by IV infusion 
every 3 weeks to patients with HER2-positive MBC. Patients could receive trastuzumab 
emtansine until documented PD or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 1 year (patients 
continuing to derive benefit from treatment could enroll in the extension study 
TDM4529g/BO25430).  
Tumor response assessments were performed every 6 weeks (after two cycles of trastuzumab 
emtansine), between Days 15 and 21 of the relevant cycle. Study endpoints related to response 
were determined by an independent radiologic review of patient scans. A single radiologist 
reviewed all scans with no adjudication process.

Key inclusion criteria: Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer with measurable disease,  HER2-positive documented by local laboratory assessment as 
FISH-positive or 3 + by IHC; history of progression on HER2-directed therapy (or up to 60 days 
after receiving trastuzumab) for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer (minimum of 6 
weeks exposure to HER2-directed therapy); for patients who had received HER2-directed therapy 
in the adjuvant setting only, there was the requirement for a radiographic documentation that 
disease progression did not occur prior to initiation of such therapy. At least one chemotherapy 
agent for MBC. 
There were 111 women and one man who enrolled in this study (a total of 112 patients). 
Patients had a median age of 54.5 years and the majority of patients were white (90.2%). Most 
patients had ECOG PS of 0 (53.6%) or 1 (38.4%), and 1 patient had an ECOG PS of 3 (0.9%). 
All patients had HER2-positive disease by local assessment (3+ IHC and/or HER2 gene 
amplification by FISH): 26.8% of tumors were positive by both FISH and IHC, 33.0% by IHC 
alone, and 40.2% by FISH alone. The majority of patients (91.1%) initially presented with 
infiltrating ductal carcinoma and about half of the patients’ tumors at initial diagnosis were ER 
and/or PR positive.  
At study entry, all patients had measurable disease, as assessed by the investigator, with 
significant disease burden; 75% of patients had disease involvement in three or more distinct 
sites. The most frequently involved sites with metastatic disease were lung (56.3%), liver 
(56.3%), and bone (52.7%). Patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of eight 
anti-cancer agents received and most patients had received one or more chemotherapeutic 
agents used for the treatment of breast cancer: taxane (83.9%), anthracycline (70.5%), 
capecitabine (66.1%), and carboplatin (42.0%). Hormone therapy had previously been received 
by 41.1% of patients and, in accordance with the protocol, all patients had received HER2-
directed therapy (trastuzumab and/or lapatinib) before entering the study. A total of 67 patients 
(59.8%) received both trastuzumab and lapatinib. 
The median number of cycles received in this study was 7 and patients were on study treatment 
for a median duration of 18.1 weeks (ie, 4.2 months). Key efficacy results are summarized in the

Study TDM4450g/BO21976 
Study TDM4450g/BO21976 is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, international, two-arm, open-
label clinical trial designed to explore the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine relative 
to the combination of trastuzumab and docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive, unresectable, 
LABC and/or MBC who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: 
•  Arm A: Trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg intravenous (IV) on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle. 
•  Arm B: For Cycle 1, Day 1, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg IV + docetaxel either 75 mg/m2 or 100 
mg/m2 IV. On Day 1 of all subsequent 3-week cycles, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV + docetaxel 
75 − 100 mg/m2 IV 
Tumor assessments were conducted every 9 weeks from the start of treatment until documented 
PD or death on study.  
In Treatment Arm A, patients who had not yet progressed but who had become intolerant to 
trastuzumab emtansine (i.e., experienced unacceptable toxicity requiring discontinuation from 
treatment with trastuzumab emtansine), and for whom single-agent trastuzumab was an option, 
were eligible to remain on the study and to receive trastuzumab administered according to 
prescribing guidelines in the metastatic setting until PD, clinical deterioration, and/or 
unacceptable toxicity for the duration of the trial. Trastuzumab emtansine treatment was to be 
permanently discontinued in these patients.  At study close, patients from both treatment arms 
without PD could transfer to the extension study TDM4529g/BO25430. 
In Treatment Arm B, patients who had not yet progressed but who had become intolerant to 
either docetaxel or trastuzumab (ie, experienced unacceptable toxicity that required 
discontinuation from docetaxel or trastuzumab) could remain in the study and receive single-
agent trastuzumab or docetaxel, respectively, until PD, clinical deterioration, or intolerance. 
Patients in Treatment Arm B who discontinued study treatment because of PD were eligible to 
cross over to trastuzumab emtansine treatment, starting at 3.6 mg/kg, until a second PD event, 
clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance. 
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. Patients who were discontinued from study 
treatment for reasons other than PD were followed with tumor assessments every 9 weeks until 
PD. Subsequently, all patients are followed for survival and subsequent anti-cancer therapies

approximately every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study 
termination by the Sponsor. 
This study enrolled 137 patients with 67 randomized to receive trastuzumab emtansine and 70 
randomized to receive trastuzumab + docetaxel.  
All patients were female, with a median age of approximately 54 years (range: 27 - 82). A higher 
percentage of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm were ≥65 years compared with the 
trastuzumab + docetaxel arm (22.4% vs. 12.9%). 
The majority of patients were white (80.3%). As required by the protocol, all patients had ECOG 
PS of 0 (64.7%) or 1 (35.3%). Patients were confirmed to have HER2-positive disease (IHC3+ 
and/or FISH+) based on local laboratory assessment of tumor tissue specimens.  
All patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm and 69 patients (98.6%) in the trastuzumab + 
docetaxel arm had measurable disease at baseline, per investigator assessment, and the median 
sum of the longest tumor diameters per patient was similar in both treatment arms. There was a 
notable difference in the two arms in the number of sites of disease involvement; 40.3% and 
20.3% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab + docetaxel treatment arms, 
respectively, had ≥ 4 sites of involvement. 
Other breast cancer characteristics were comparable between the two treatment arms eg, ER 
and PR status and measurable disease at baseline. Disease-free interval was a stratification 
factor: 59.7% and 64.3% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab + 
docetaxel arms, respectively, had a disease-free interval ≤ 24 months, and the rest of the 
patients had a disease-free interval > 24 months. 
The most common tumor histology at the time of diagnosis was infiltrating ductal carcinoma 
(85.1% vs. 89.9% for the trastuzumab emtansine arm and trastuzumab + docetaxel arm, 
respectively); 3.0% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm and 8.7% of patients in the 
trastuzumab + docetaxel arm had infiltrating lobular carcinoma, and one patient (in the 
trastuzumab emtansine arm) had inflammatory breast carcinoma. 
Overall, 22.6% of patients (17.9% in the trastuzumab emtansine arm and 27.1% in the control 
arm) had received prior (neo) adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. The most common prior therapies 
were anthracycline (46.7%) and taxane (36.5%), and were similar across treatment arms. 
Hormone therapy had previously been received by 27.7% of patients in total; 30.0% in the 
trastuzumab + docetaxel arm and 25.4% in the trastuzumab emtansine arm. 
The median number of cycles of trastuzumab emtansine was 16.0 (range: 1 - 41) and the 
median duration of treatment was 10.4 months (range: 0 - 29). In the trastuzumab + docetaxel 
group, the median trastuzumab treatment duration was 8.1 months (range: 1 - 29) and the 
median docetaxel treatment duration was 5.5 months (range: 0 - 22). Key efficacy results are 
summarized in the below table.

TDM4450g/BO21976: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of PFS (all Randomized Patients) 
T+D = trastuzumab + docetaxel; T-DM1 = trastuzumab emtansine 
2.1.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study TDM4370g/BO21977 was a randomized, multicenter, international, two-arm, open-label 
trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine with that of 
capecitabine plus lapatinib for patients with HER2-positive MBC or LABC who had previously 
received trastuzumab and a taxane. Results from the pivotal trial are supported by data from two 
single-arm Phase II studies in patients with HER-2 positive MBC, previously treated with HER2-
directed therapies and chemotherapy (TDM4374g which enrolled heavily pre-treated patients in 
third or last line, and TDM4258g which enrolled patients for 2nd line treatment), and a two-arm 
randomized Phase II study in patients who have not received any systemic therapy in the MBC 
setting (TDM4450g/BO21976). 
Potential bias in the adjudication of progression and response were minimized using an 
Independent Review Committee (IRC). However, the IRC charter for Study TDM4370g/BO21977 
was not followed with respect to the blinding of treatment-specific toxicities which were required 
to be excluded by the charter. Information on toxicities were inadvertently included in the 
adverse event data provided to the independent central reader for review of the radiographic and 
clinical data by the oncology reviewer. Although this may have introduced bias in the 
adjudication of PFS, there was a high concordance rate (94%) between radiology (blind) and 
oncology (potentially unblinded) reviews and important bias could be ruled out.   
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 75/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
A heterogeneous population has been enrolled in this study, ranging from heavily pretreated 
patients to those with early progression (within 6 months) after an adjuvant regimen, 
unresectable LABC, MBC. As per inclusion criteria, all patients were lapatinib naïve but should 
have already received trastuzumab and a taxane.  
Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is indicated for treatment of MBC following 
anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab in a metastatic setting. Thus, the selected population 
included patients for whom lapatinib+capecitabine combination is currently not indicated 
(unresectable LABC or patients who progressed within 6 months of their most recent adjuvant 
treatment). This was based on the assumption that unresectable LABC, early progression, and 
MBC patient population are clinically similar.  
The Applicant identified only 15 patients with LABC: 9 in the lapatinib + capecitabine arm and 6 
in the T-DM1 arm. The numbers are very low and prohibit any reasonable analysis.  
However, the chosen control of lapatinib+capecitabine was considered adequate to establish the 
efficacy of T-DM1 in this superiority design of study. 
The dosing schedule of T-DM1, 3.6 mg/kg IV every 21 days, was chosen on the basis on the 
results of a phase 1 dose-escalation study. The recommended dose of trastuzumab emtansine is 
3.6 mg/kg given as an IV infusion q3w until PD or unacceptable toxicity. The qw and q3w 
schedules of trastuzumab emtansine both showed activity in patients with previously treated 
HER2-positive MBC, with CBRs of 57% and 50%, respectively. Overall, the reason for choosing 
the q3w regimen was a more favorable safety and tolerability profile. The duration of response 
among patients with an objective partial response was longer in the q3w cohort (10.5 months) 
compared to the qw cohort (5.6 months), although the sample size was small. More patients in 
the qw group experienced at least one Grade > 3 adverse event compared to the q3w group. The 
median dose intensity was 99.7% in the q3w group and 82% in the qw group. Thus, the choice 
of the q3w regimen seems appropriate.  
The choice of the 100 mg and the 160 mg presentations has been adequately justified to provide 
flexible combinations over the likely body weight range of patients while minimizing product 
waste. 
During a GCP inspection, under-reporting of adverse events from one site was observed. The risk 
of a systemic under-reporting due to unclear guidelines for investigators was assessed. Based on 
reported inspection findings and procedures implemented, it was possible to conclude that 
systemic under-reporting of adverse events was unlikely. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced in the two treatment 
arms and indicated a typical patient population as per protocol.  
The pivotal study TDM4370g/BO21977 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 
IRC-assessed PFS in patients who received trastuzumab emtansine compared with patients who 
received lapatinib plus capecitabine. The robustness of the PFS finding was confirmed by all

A statistically significant difference was also formally established for OS, objective response rate, 
time to treatment failure, and time to symptom progression. Concerning OS, statistical 
significance was based on an unplanned interim analysis, introduced in the statistical analysis 
plan after a favourable trend in OS had been observed. Data-driven interim analyses should 
generally be avoided as they can flaw the results of a clinical trial. However, in this case, the 
justification for conducting an additional OS analysis before the final analysis was provided on 
the basis of the public efficacy information and the wish to provide conclusive OS results as 
quickly as possible to allow one-way cross-over while meeting the objectives of the study. 
Concerning a possible inflation of the type-I error, this was not of major concern since the study 
the overall type I error of OS analyses was controlled by Lan-DeMets alpha spending function 
O’B-F boundary, and the p-value was well below the boundary for stopping for efficacy. 
The differences in PFS and OS observed in a patient population previously treated with 
trastuzumab are considered clinically relevant. Given the poor survival prognosis of patients with 
HER2-positive MBC whose disease has progressed following trastuzumab-based therapy, the data 
suggest an important clinical benefit for this patient population. 
As the OS analysis was based on an interim analysis, updated efficacy analyses of the TDM4370g 
trial will be provided (see Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures). 
To date most studies in MBC have failed to demonstrate an appreciable difference in PRO 
between standard of care therapy and experimental agents. In contrast, treatment with 
trastuzumab emtansine appeared to confer a longer time to symptom progression (TSP), and 
hence a better quality of life, compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine. Based on the published 
data, a 5 points change in the score within these subscales of the FACT-B questionnaire appears 
as the minimal important difference for claiming the clinical relevance of the results. However, 
due to the open label character of the study, no firm conclusions can be drawn.  
A consistent treatment benefit of trastuzumab emtansine was seen in the majority of pre-
specified subgroups evaluated, supporting the robustness of the overall result. The Applicant 
presented additional analyses of PFS and OS for patients with non-visceral disease based on the 
baseline IRC tumor assessments and by applying different definitions of visceral disease. Based 
on these analyses, the effect in patients with non-visceral disease appeared consistent with the 
overall treatment effect. 
As regards as a possibly reduced benefit in the older subgroup of patients, the interpretation is 
difficult due to the low number of patients. The results of the subgroup analysis by age are 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The initially proposed indication was changed to reflect important selection criteria in the pivotal 
trial: 
“Kadcyla, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab 
and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either: 
• Received prior therapy for advanced disease or metastatic disease, or 
• Developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant therapy.”

The results of the main study are supported by Study TDM4374g which included a heavily pre-
treated patient population, with a high IRC-assessed ORR of 32.7% (95% CI: [24.1%, 42.1%]). 
Study TDM4258g was in a second line setting including previous HER2-directed therapy also 
observed a high IRC-assessed ORR of 26.9% (95% CI: [19.2%, 35.8%]). In study 
TDM4450g/BO21976 (MBC first line), treatment with trastuzumab emtansine was associated with 
a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with trastuzumab + docetaxel 
treatment (stratified HR = 0.594; 95% CI [0.364, 0.968]; log-rank p-value = 0.0353). The 
median PFS was 14.2 months in the trastuzumab emtansine arm and 9.2 months in the 
trastuzumab + docetaxel arm.  
Immunogenicity and its impact on efficacy 
Immune responses against trastuzumab emtansine are expected to a certain extent, as for any 
biological medicine. The incidence was as expected for a humanized monoclonal antibody. 
Antibodies against trastuzumab emtansine may have an impact on efficacy as demonstrated by a 
lower median PFS although objective response rates were comparable. The clinical significance of 
anti-trastuzumab emtansine antibodies is not yet known (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established as there is no relevant use in the paediatric population in the indication of metastatic 
breast cancer (MBC).   
2.1.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Trastuzumab emtansine demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy in 
the proposed indication (as amended): 
Kadcyla, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive,  
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab 
and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either: 
•  Received prior therapy for advanced disease, or 
•  Developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant 
therapy. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

primarily from study TDM4370g/BO21977 (see Clinical efficacy; Main study). Additional 
supporting safety information is provided from five other studies; four Phase I and II 
single-arm studies of trastuzumab emtansine (TDM3569g, TDM4374g, TDM4258g, and 
TDM4688g), and one randomized Phase II study of trastuzumab emtansine versus 
trastuzumab plus docetaxel (TDM4450g/BO21976). In total, these studies provide safety data 
for 1,401 MBC patients (882 patients exposed to trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg q3w and 
519 patients exposed exclusively to the control treatments). 
Patient exposure 
In the pivotal study the median dose intensity (defined as total dose received divided by the 
expected total dose) was 99.9% for T-DM1 compared to 93.4% for lapatinib and slightly less 
(77.2%) for capecitabine. The median treatment duration was higher in the T-DM1 arm (5.7 
months) compared to 4.9 months in the lapatinib arm and 4.8 months in the capecitabine 
arm.  
In the supportive study TDM4450g/BO21976, the treatment duration was longer (median of 
10.4 months in the T-DM1 arm and 8.1 months for trastuzumab/5.5 months for docetaxel) as 
these patients were all receiving 1st line therapy for MBC (less heavily pre-treated).  The 
median dose intensity for T-DM1 was 99.3%. In comparison, the median dose intensity was 
100% for trastuzumab and 95.3% for docetaxel.

Adverse events 
The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥25%) with trastuzumab emtansine were 
thrombocytopenia, fatigue, increased transaminases, nausea, headache, musculoskeletal pain 
and constipation. The majority of ADRs reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity.

The most common National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI-CTCAE; version 3.0) Grade 3 or 4 ADRs (> 2%) were thrombocytopenia, fatigue, increased 
transaminases, anaemia, hypokalaemia, musculoskeletal pain and neutropenia. The most 
common serious ADRs were pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, 
constipation, diarrhoea, dyspnoea and pneumonitis (see Serious Adverse Events). 
The table 3 presents an overview of the safety profile of T-DM1; Table 4 presents a summary of 
adverse events with difference in incidence rate  ≥  5%: between the trastuzumab emtansine 
arm and the lapatinib + capecitabine arms. 
Table 5 presents frequency of adverse events by NCI CTCAE Grade, Adverse Drug Reaction 
(ADR) Preferred Term (PT). The ADR table in the SmPC is based on any AEs for which a causal 
relationship is at least a reasonable possibility without regards to incidence. The following 
methodology was used to select ADRs for inclusion into the SmPC ADR Table:  
• 
The ADR evaluation was performed based on: 
o  AE listing by SOC and MedDRA PT 
o  Primarily data from the pivotal trial TDM4370g/BO21977 
o  Data from Study TDM4450g/BO21976 (in which the majority of patients were 
trastuzumab naïve)  
o  Data from the individual studies TDM4370g/BO21977, TDM4450g/BO21976, 
TDM4374g, TDM4258g, TDMTDM3569g, and TDM4688g, including data from 43 
patients from these Phase I and II studies who enrolled in the extension study 
TDM4529g/BO25430. 
•  Clinical judgement of causality was applied for all AEs using the Bradford-Hill Paradigm 
(Bradford Hill, 1965): 
• 
• 
The reviewed PTs were grouped by diagnosis or clinical entity where appropriate (eg, a 
diagnosis vs. sign/symptom). 
The incidence for defined diagnosis/PT representing the clinical entity was calculated by 
summing the included PTs (example: thrombocytopenia + decreased platelet counts; anemia 
+ decreased hemoglobin; neuropathy peripheral + peripheral sensory neuropathy + 
paraesthesia, etc.).

Events of special interest 
Identified and potential risks of treatment with trastuzumab emtansine (and the corresponding 
tests, monitoring and precautions that have been put in place in clinical trials) were based on all 
available nonclinical and clinical data relating to trastuzumab emtansine, as well as on the clinical 
toxicities associated with trastuzumab and the parent molecule of DM1, maytansine.   
Transaminases increased (AST/ALT) 
Increase in serum transaminases (Grade 1-4) has been observed during treatment with 
trastuzumab emtansine in clinical studies. Transaminase elevations were generally transient. A 
cumulative effect of trastuzumab emtansine on transaminases has been observed, and generally 
recovered when treatment was discontinued. Increased transaminases were reported in 28% of 
patients in clinical studies. Grade 3 or 4 increased AST and ALT were reported in 4.1% and 2.8% 
of patients respectively and usually occurred in the early treatment cycles (1-6). In general, the 
Grade ≥ 3 hepatic events were not associated with poor clinical outcome; subsequent follow-up 
values tended to show improvement to ranges allowing the patient to remain on study and 
continue to receive study treatment at the same or reduced dose. No relationship was observed 
between trastuzumab emtansine exposure (AUC), trastuzumab emtansine maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax), total trastuzumab exposure (AUC), or Cmax of DM1 and increases in 
transaminase.  
A multivariate analysis of patients receiving trastuzumab emtansine in Study 
TDM4370g/BO21977, using the clinical cut−off date of 31 July 2012, was conducted to determine 
whether there are potential risk factors for developing a hepatotoxicity event. A multivariate 
logistic model was fit using the following independent variables at baseline: AST, ALT, and TBL 
values, presence of liver metastases, hepatotoxic drug use, world region, prior chemotherapy 
regimen in locally advanced/metastatic setting, presence of visceral disease, age, race, number 
of disease sites, prior anthracycline therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status, progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER) status, presence of 
measurable disease, menopausal status, prior anticancer therapy, prior trastuzumab therapy, 
and HER2 status by FISH and IHC results. The dependent variable used in the model was post-
baseline development of a severe hepatic event, defined as a Grade 3-5 adverse event (AE) from 
among the preferred terms in the pre-defined selected AE basket of hepatotoxicity or a Grade 3-
5 event of AST, ALT or TBL increase. Results from this analysis showed baseline ALT (actual 
value in U/L) to be a potential risk factor for developing a severe hepatic event (odds ratio=1.02; 
95% CI: 1.00, 1.03).  The value of the odds ratio suggests that for every increase of one unit in 
the baseline ALT value there is an approximately 2% increase in the odds of experiencing a 
severe hepatic event.  
Left ventricular dysfunction 
Left ventricular dysfunction was reported in 2.0% of patients in clinical studies with trastuzumab 
emtansine. The majority of events were asymptomatic Grade 1 or 2 decrease in LVEF. Grade 3 
or 4 events were reported in 0.3% of patients. These uncommon Grade 3 or 4 events usually 
occurred in the early treatment cycles (1-2). Additional LVEF monitoring is recommended for 
patients with LVEF ≤ 45% (See Table 5 in section 4.2 for specific dose modifications).  
Infusion-related reactions 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 85/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
  
  
Infusion-related reactions are characterised by one or more of the following symptoms: flushing, 
chills, pyrexia, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm and tachycardia. 
Infusion-related reactions were reported in 4.5% of patients in clinical studies with trastuzumab 
emtansine, with one Grade 3 and no Grade 4 events reported. Infusion-related reactions 
resolved over the course of several hours to a day after the infusion was terminated. No dose 
relationship was observed in clinical studies. For dose modifications in the event of 
infusion-related reactions, see section 4.2 and 4.4.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity was reported in 2.6% of patients in clinical studies with trastuzumab emtansine, 
with no Grade 3 or 4 events reported. Overall, the majority of hypersensitivity reactions were 
mild or moderate in severity and resolved upon treatment. For dose modifications in the event of 
hypersensitivity reactions, see section 4.2 and 4.4.  
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia or decreased platelet counts were reported in 31.4% of patients in clinical 
studies with trastuzumab emtansine and was the most common adverse reaction leading to 
treatment discontinuation (1.4%). The majority of the patients had Grade 1 or 2 events 
(≥ 50,000/mm3), with the nadir occurring by day 8 and generally improving to Grade 0 or 1 
(≥ 75,000/mm3) by the next scheduled dose. In clinical studies, the incidence and severity of 
thrombocytopenia were higher in Asian patients. Independent of race, the incidence of Grade 3 
or 4 events (< 50,000/mm3) was 11.3% in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine. The 
incidence of severe haemorrhagic events (Grade ≥3) occurred in 1.7% of the overall 
trastuzumab emtansine treated patients and 1% of Asian trastuzumab emtansine treated 
patients.  In some of the observed cases the patients were also receiving anti-coagulation 
therapy. Cases of bleeding events with a fatal outcome have been observed. For dose 
modifications for thrombocytopenia, see section 4.2 and 4.4.   
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response to trastuzumab 
emtansine. A total of 836 patients from six clinical studies were tested at multiple time points for 
anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) responses to trastuzumab emtansine. Following dosing, 
5.3% (44/836) of patients tested positive for anti-trastuzumab emtansine antibodies at one or 
more post-dose time points. The clinical significance of anti-trastuzumab emtansine antibodies is 
not yet known.  
Extravasation 
Reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed in clinical studies with trastuzumab 
emtansine. These reactions were usually mild and comprised erythema, tenderness, skin 
irritation, pain, or swelling at the infusion site. These reactions have been observed more 
frequently within 24 hours of infusion. Specific treatment for trastuzumab emtansine 
extravasation is unknown at this time.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The most common serious ADRs were pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspnoea and pneumonitis.

Evaluable Patients)  
Laboratory findings 
Pivotal Study TDM4370g/BO21977 
More patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm had decreased hemoglobin level (7 of 352 
patients [2.0%] shifted from Grade 0 to Grade  ≥ 3) compared with the lapatinib plus 
capecitabine arm (2 of 360 patients [0.6%] shifted from Grade 0 to Grade  ≥ 3); fewer patients 
in patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm had decreased neutrophil counts (15 of 450 
patients [3.3%] shifted from Grade 0 to Grade  ≥ 3) compared with the lapatinib plus 
capecitabine arm (33 of 473 patients [7.0%] shifted from Grade 0 to Grade  ≥ 3). There was no 
shift in lymphocytes count in either of the treatment arms.

Safety in special populations 
An overview of AEs by subgroup revealed that Asians had more severe events than other races, 
primarily due to a higher risk of thrombocytopenia as previously described. When focusing on 
AEs by age categories in the T-DM1 arm, the large majority of patients in the pivotal trial 
included patients < 65 years of age (426 patients). Only 64 patients were ≥ 65 years of age. 
When comparing these subgroups, slightly more Grade≥ 3 events were observed in patients ≥ 
65 years of age (46.9%) compared with patients < 65 years of age (39.9%). A similar pattern 
was observed for SAEs (≥ 65: 21.9%, < 65: 14.6%) and for discontinuations due to AEs (≥ 65 
: 12.5%, < 65: 4.9%). Overall the observed frequencies of severe events, SAEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs were consistently higher in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm 
compared to the T-DM1 arm in patients ≥ 65 years of age. There was no higher risk of 
developing cardiotoxicity, hemorrhage or hepatotoxicity in patients ≥ 65 years of age when 
treated with T-DM1. The subgroup of patients ≥ 75 years of age only included 11 patients.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have been conducted with trastuzumab 
emtansine. Post-marketing case reports of trastuzumab indicate that use during pregnancy 
increases the risk of oligohydramnios during the second and third trimester. To date, no 
pregnancies have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine, and no 
studies of trastuzumab emtansine have been conducted in pregnant women. 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while receiving trastuzumab 
emtansine and for 6 months following the last dose of trastuzumab emtansine. Male patients or 
their female partners should also use effective contraception. 
There are no data from the use of trastuzumab emtansine in pregnant women. Trastuzumab, a 
component of trastuzumab emtansine, can cause foetal harm or death when administered to a 
pregnant woman. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, some associated 
with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, have been reported in pregnant women receiving 
trastuzumab. Animal studies of maytansine, a closely related chemical entity of the same 
maytansinoid class as DM1, suggest that DM1, the microtubule inhibiting cytotoxic component 
of trastuzumab emtansine, is expected to be teratogenic and potentially embryotoxic (see 
section 5.3). 
Administration of trastuzumab emtansine to pregnant women is not recommended and women 
should be informed of the possibility of harm to the foetus before they become pregnant. 
Women who become pregnant must immediately contact their doctor. If a pregnant woman is 
treated with trastuzumab emtansine, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is 
recommended. 
It is not known whether trastuzumab emtansine is excreted in human milk. Since many 
medicinal products are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in breast-feeding infants, women should discontinue breast-feeding prior to initiating 
treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. Women may begin breast-feeding 6 months after 
concluding treatment.  
Overdose 
There is no known antidote for trastuzumab emtansine overdose. In case of overdose, the 
patient should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate 
symptomatic treatment instituted. Cases of overdose have been reported with trastuzumab 
emtansine treatment, most associated with thrombocytopenia, and there was one death. In the 
fatal case, the patient incorrectly received trastuzumab emtansine 6 mg/kg and died 
approximately 3 weeks following the overdose; a causal relationship to trastuzumab emtansine 
was not established (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No additional information is currently available.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In pivotal study TDM4370g/BO21977, 29 patients (5.9%) discontinued trastuzumab 
emtansine due to an AE, compared with 37 patients (7.6%) discontinuing lapatinib, and 46

patients (9.4%) who discontinued capecitabine due to AEs. In the lapatinib plus capecitabine 
arm, 6 patients (1.2%) discontinued only lapatinib, 15 patients (3.1%) discontinued only 
capecitabine, and 31 patients (6.4%) discontinued both study drugs (Study 
TDM4370g/BO21977 CSR). The most common AEs leading to trastuzumab emtansine 
withdrawal were in the SOC of blood and lymphatic system disorders (primarily 
thrombocytopenia) and investigations (liver enzyme increases). For both capecitabine and 
lapatinib, discontinuations were most commonly due to gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea 
and vomiting) or skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (principally PPE syndrome). 
In pivotal study TDM4370g/BO21977, fewer patients in the trastuzumab emtansine arm had 
AEs that led to dose reductions compared with the patients in lapatinib plus capecitabine arm

available.  
2.2.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The size of the safety database and the exposure are considered adequate to allow 
assessment and characterization of the safety profile of T-DM1. Standard methods have been 
used for the detection and reporting of adverse events. Dose modification guides are 
adequately described in the SmPC (see section 4.2). 
Common adverse event 
Common AEs known to be associated with trastuzumab are infusion-reactions, flu-like 
symtoms, haematological toxicities and cardiotoxicity. Maytansine is a cytotoxic agent that

inhibits the assembly of microtubules. Its clinical use has so far been limited due to its lack of 
tumour specificity and unacceptable adverse effects (severe nausea and vomiting as well as 
neurotoxicity). As expected based on the well-characterised toxicities associated with the 
respective components of these regimens, the most common AEs (>20%) reported in the T-
DM1 arm were nausea (39.2%), fatigue (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (28.0%), headache 
(27.1%), diarrhea (23.3%), AST increased (22.4%), decreased appetite (20.6%) and 
epistaxis (20.2%). In comparison, the most common AEs in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm 
were diarrhea (79.7%), Palmar-Plantar Erythrodyseastesia (PPE) syndrome (58.0%), nausea 
(44.7%), vomiting (29.3%), rash (26.6%) and decreased appetite (23.2%). 
Severe, life-threatening adverse events, and serious adverse events 
In the pivotal study 40.8% of patients in the T-DM1 arm reported Grade ≥ 3 AEs (most 
commonly thrombocytopenia and ASAT increased in 12.9% and 4.3% of patients, 
respectively). In comparison, 57.0% of patients in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm reported 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs events (most commonly diarrhoea and PPE syndrome in 20.7% and 16.4% of 
patients, respectively). Grade 5 events were rare (5 events in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm 
vs. 3 events in the T-DM1 arm). A similar pattern was observed in the supportive studies. A 
slightly lower frequency of SAEs was observed in the T-DM1 arm (15.5%) compared to the 
lapatinib+capecitabine arm (18.0%) in the pivotal trial. In general, the reported SAEs were 
represented by many different events with no particular or unexpected accumulation. The 
most common (>1%) SAEs by System Organ Class (SOC) in the T-DM1 arm were Infections 
and infestations (4.1%, no predominant preferred terms were observed). Of note, sepsis and 
bacteriemia only represented 0.4% and 0.2% of these events, respectively. In the 
lapatinib+capecitabine arm the most common SAEs by SOC were Gastrointestinal disorders 
(5.9%, mainly diarrhea). In the total T-DM1-exposed safety population 18.6% of patients had 
reported SAEs which is in line with the frequency observed in the pivotal trial.  
Hepatotoxicity 
Patients with baseline elevation of ALT (e.g. due to liver metastases) may be predisposed to 
liver injury with a higher risk of a Grade 3-5 hepatic event or liver function test increase. 
Hepatotoxicity, predominantly in the form of asymptomatic increases in the concentrations of 
serum transaminases (Grade 1-4 transaminitis), has been observed during treatment with 
trastuzumab emtansine in clinical studies. Transaminase elevations were generally transient 
with peak elevation at day 8 after administration of therapy and subsequent recovery to Grade 
1 or less prior to the next cycle. A cumulative effect on transaminases has also been observed 
(the proportion of patients with Grade 1-2 ALT/AST abnormalities increases with successive 
cycles). Patients with elevated transaminases improved to Grade 1 or normal within 30 days of 
the last dose of trastuzumab emtansine in the majority of the cases.  
Serious hepatobiliary disorders, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver 
and some with a fatal outcome due to drug-induced liver injury have been observed in patients 
treated with trastuzumab emtansine. Observed cases may have been confounded by 
comorbidities and/or concomitant medicinal products with known hepatotoxic potential. 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 92/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
  
  
Liver function should be monitored prior to initiation of treatment and each dose. Dose 
reductions or discontinuation for increased serum transaminases and total bilirubin are 
specified in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver have been identified from liver 
biopsies in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine. NRH is a rare liver condition 
characterised by widespread benign transformation of hepatic parenchyma into small 
regenerative nodules; NRH may lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Diagnosis of NRH can 
be confirmed only by histopathology. NRH should be considered in all patients with clinical 
symptoms of portal hypertension and/or cirrhosis-like pattern seen on the computed 
tomography (CT) scan of the liver but with normal transaminases and no other manifestations 
of cirrhosis. Upon diagnosis of NRH, trastuzumab emtansine treatment must be permanently 
discontinued.  
Trastuzumab emtansine has not been studied in patients with serum 
transaminases > 2.5 × ULN or total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN prior to initiation of treatment. 
Treatment in patients with serum transaminases > 3 × ULN and concomitant total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN should be permanently discontinued.  
A hepatic impairment study (BO25499) will prospectively evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
trastuzumab emtansine in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared with 
patients with normal hepatic function (see RMP). Dose modifications in the event of increased 
transaminases, are reflected in the SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4.  
Thrombocytopenia 
In the pivotal study the frequency of thrombocytopenia was 30.4% in the T-DM1 arm and only 
2.9% in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm. Grade ≥3 events represented 13.9% of events in the 
T-DM1 arm. In general, platelet counts recovered before the next scheduled dose. 
Thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation 
(see section 4.8).  
Asian patients more commonly experienced thrombocytopenia (51.1%), these patients also had 
a higher risk of developing Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (41.3%). No association between 
exposure and the risk of developing thrombocytopenia could be demonstrated. A similar pattern 
was observed in the total T-DM1-exposed safety population.  
Cases of bleeding events with a fatal outcome have been observed. Severe cases of 
haemorrhagic events, including central nervous system haemorrhage, have been reported in 
clinical studies; these events were independent of ethnicity. In some of the observed cases the 
patients were also receiving anti-coagulation therapy.  
It is recommended that platelet counts are monitored prior to each trastuzumab emtansine 
dose. Patients with thrombocytopenia (≤ 100,000/mm3) and patients on anti-coagulant 
treatment (e.g. warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparins) should be monitored closely 
while on trastuzumab emtansine treatment. Trastuzumab emtansine has not been studied in 
patients with platelet counts ≤ 100,000/mm3 prior to initiation of treatment. In the event of

decreased platelet count to Grade 3 or greater (< 50,000/mm3), do not administer 
trastuzumab emtansine until platelet counts recover to Grade 1 (≥ 75,000/mm3) (see 
section SmPC 4.2).  
Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions 
All patients in the pivotal study had previously received treatment and tolerated trastuzumab 
and a low rate of infusion- and hypersensitivity reactions was expected in the T-DM1 arm 
(3.9%). All events were of mild or modest severity (Grade 1 or 2). In the total T-DM1 exposed 
safety population infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions were noted in 6.7% of 
patients.  
Trastuzumab emtansine treatment has not been studied in patients who had trastuzumab 
permanently discontinued due to infusion-related reactions (IRR); treatment is not 
recommended for these patients. Patients should be observed closely for infusion-related 
reactions, especially during the first infusion. 
Infusion-related reactions (due to cytokine release), characterized by one or more of the 
following symptoms -have been reported: flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnoea, hypotension, 
wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia. In general, these symptoms were not severe (see 
section 4.8). In most patients, these reactions resolved over the course of several hours to a 
day after the infusion was terminated. Treatment should be interrupted in patients with a 
severe IRR until signs and symptoms resolve. Consideration for re-treatment should be based 
on clinical assessment of the severity of the reaction. Treatment must be permanently 
discontinued in the event of a life threatening infusion-related reaction (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Trastuzumab emtansine treatment has not been studied in patients who had trastuzumab 
permanently discontinued due to hypersensitivity; treatment with trastuzumab emtansine is not 
recommended for these patients. Patients should be observed closely for 
hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, which may have the same clinical presentation as an IRR. 
Serious, anaphylactic reactions have been observed in clinical studies with trastuzumab 
emtansine. Medicinal products to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should 
be available for immediate use. In the event of a true hypersensitivity reaction (in which 
severity of reaction increases with subsequent infusions), trastuzumab emtansine treatment 
must be permanently discontinued (see SmPC section 4.3).  
Pneumonitis 
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, some leading to acute 
respiratory distress syndrome or a fatal outcome, have been reported in clinical studies with 
trastuzumab emtansine. Signs and symptoms include dyspnoea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary 
infiltrates. Six cases of pneumonitis were reported in the T-DM1 arm of the pivotal study (1.2% 
of patients). All events were of Grade 2 severity. In the total T-DM1-exposed safety population 
9 patients (1.0%) developed pneumonitis. One case was fatal. The SmPC contains relevant 
warnings (see section 4.3). It is recommended that treatment with trastuzumab emtansine be 
permanently discontinued in patients who are diagnosed with ILD or pneumonitis. Patients with 
dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and co-morbidities may be at 
increased risk of pulmonary events.

Cardiotoxicity 
Cardiotoxicity (mainly decreased EF) is a common AE associated with the use of trastuzumab. 
Although most events are manageable, cardiac failure can be observed in 2% of patients (see 
SmPC of trastuzumab). Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction is also commonly observed 
in patients treated with lapatinib (see SmPC of lapatinib).  
With T-DM1 the risk of cardiotoxicity seems overall to be low and most events were of 
mild/modest severity. It should be noted that that all patients enrolled in the pivotal study had 
a LVEF value  ≥ 50% at baseline and that patients with symptomatic CHF requiring treatment, a 
history of CHF, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, myocardial infarction or 
unstable angina within 6 months of randomization, current dyspnea at rest due to advanced 
malignancy or Grade  ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy were excluded from the study. 
Cardiac dysfunction is an identified risk and relevant warnings and recommended dose 
modifications in case of Left Ventricular Dysfunction have been included in the SmPC (see 
section 4.2 and 4.3). Patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine are at increased risk of 
developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% has 
been observed in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine, and therefore symptomatic 
congestive heart failure (CHF) is a potential risk (see SmPC section 4.8). General risk factors 
for a cardiac event and those identified in adjuvant breast cancer studies with trastuzumab 
therapy include advancing age (> 50 years), low baseline LVEF values (< 55%), low LVEF 
levels prior to or following the use of paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting, prior or concomitant use 
of antihypertensive medications, previous therapy with an anthracycline and high BMI (> 25 
kg/m2). 
Standard cardiac function testing (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scanning) 
should be performed prior to initiation and at regular intervals (e.g. every three months) during 
treatment. In clinical studies, patients had a LVEF ≥ 50% at baseline. Patients with a history of 
congestive heart failure (CHF), serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, history of 
myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of randomization, or current dyspnoea 
at rest due to advanced malignancy were excluded from clinical studies. The dose should be 
delayed or treatment discontinued as necessary in cases of left ventricular dysfunction (see 
section SmPC 4.2). 
Hypokalaemia 
Hypokalemia was reported in 9.2% of patients in both the TDM-1 and lapatinib+ capecitabine 
arms, respectively. Hypokalemia was reported in 15.4% of patients in the total TDM-1-exposed 
safety population. Most of these events were of Grade 1 or 2. The mechanism by which the T-
DM1 causes hypokalemia is unknown but appeared to be unrelated to renal dysfunction.  
Neurotoxicity 
Peripheral neuropathy, mainly Grade 1 and predominantly sensory, was reported by 23.3% of 
patients in the T-DM1 arm and by 18.2% of patients in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm in the 
pivotal study. Patients with Grade  ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy at baseline were excluded from 
clinical studies.  Treatment with trastuzumab emtansine should be temporarily discontinued in 
patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until symptoms resolve or improve to

≤ Grade 2. Patients should be clinically monitored on an ongoing basis for signs/symptoms of 
neurotoxicity (see SmPC section 4.3).  
Special populations 
When focusing on AEs by age categories in the T-DM1 arm, the large majority of patients in the 
pivotal trial included patients < 65 years of age (426 patients). Overall the observed 
frequencies of severe events, SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were consistently higher in 
the lapatinib+capecitabine arm compared to the T-DM1 arm in patients ≥ 65 years of age. 
However, only 64 patients were ≥  65 years of age and as such the safety population is 
considered too small especially with regard to assessment of cardiotoxicity. The Applicant will 
provide a separate analysis of the safety in patients ≥  65 years from the ongoing studies (see 
Pharmacovigilance development plan, and RMP).    
Prior treatment with pertuzumab 
The Applicant has conducted an analysis of the safety data for patients who have received prior 
treatment with pertuzumab (data not shown). The analysis did not show any concerning safety 
signals, and the safety profile was consistent with the safety profile of the total patient 
population in the T-DM1 arm. However, a higher incidence of infusion/hypersensitivity events 
has been reported (9.8% vs 3.9% overall). This information has been included in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC.  The Applicant will report back at regular intervals (e.g. together with the PSURs) on 
the safety of T-DM1 following previous exposure with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. 
Medication error 
In order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the 
medicinal product being prepared and administered is Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) and 
not trastuzumab (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Six cases of medication error occurred in the clinical trials. Of these 4 were due to a confusion 
between trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab. The medication errors occurred with a 
product labeled for clinical trials, which had no tradename or specific distinguishing features to 
differentiate the two products. By making a distinct difference of vials and packages between 
Kadcyla and Herceptin, the risk of medication error is minimized.  Furthermore, Kadcyla and 
Herceptin will only be prescribed by a physician and administered under the supervision of a 
healthcare professional who is experienced in the treatment of cancer patients which will 
further reduce the risk of medication error. Finally, the applicant shall ensure that in parallel to 
the launch of Kadcyla, all health care professionals who may prescribe, dispense or administer 
Kadcyla and/or Herceptin are provided with a health care professional (HCP) educational pack.  
This HCP educational pack shall consist of the Kadcyla SmPC and health care professional 
information regarding correct administration of Kadcyla and differentiation from Herceptin in 
order to prevent medication errors (see RMP and additional risk minimisation measures in 
Annex II of the Product Information as well as in the condition to the Marketing Authorisation in 
the Recommendations section below). 
Non-validated HER2 testing 
Patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine should have HER2 positive tumour status, 
defined as a score of 3 + by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a ratio of ≥ 2.0 by in situ 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 96/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
  
  
hybridization (ISH) assessed by a CE-marked In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) medical device. If a 
CE-marked IVD is not available, the HER2-status should be assessed by an alternate validated 
test (see SmPC section 4.2).  
There is a risk for false-positive HER2 scores using non-validated tests before initiating 
trastuzumab emtansine treatment, and with this a potential lack of benefit due to the absence 
or insufficient expression of the target. Additionally, a false-negative HER2 score will take away 
the opportunity for treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. However, it is difficult to quantify 
these risks, either in terms of the number of patients being tested with non-validated tests or 
the accuracy of these tests.  Use of a non-validated HER2 test has been included as a safety 
concern as missing information. Data from the ongoing MO28231 study will be used to quantify 
use of validated tests as additional pharmacovigilance measure (see RMP).  
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and to use machines have been performed. 
The significance of reported adverse reactions such as fatigue, headache, dizziness and 
blurred vision on the ability to drive or use machines is unknown. Patients experiencing 
infusion-related reactions should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms 
abate (see SmPC section 4.7).  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established as there is no relevant use in the paediatric population in the indication of 
metastatic breast cancer.   
2.2.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of T-DM1 is considered acceptable in the proposed indication and compared 
favourably to the lapatinib+capecitabine regimen in the main clinical study.    
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
•  Submission of analysed data from the safety database for all cases in which patients 
have had previous exposure to trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab,  is requested as part of 
the PSUR/PBRER at 6-monthly intervals for the first four years following marketing 
approval in the EU. 
2.3.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.

SmPC Section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
An overview is provided of fetal harm caused by 
trastuzumab in the post-marketing setting. It is noted 
that the DM1 component of trastuzumab emtansine is 
expected to be teratogenic and possibly embryotoxic. 
Healthcare professionals are advised that 
administration of trastuzumab emtansine to pregnant 
women is not recommended; that women should be 
advised of the possibility of harm to the fetus 
before they become pregnant, and that women 
who become pregnant must contact their 
physician It is additionally recommended that if a 
pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab 
emtansine, close monitoring of the pregnancy should 
be performed by a multidisciplinary team. It is also 
recommended that female patients of childbearing 
potential be advised to use effective contraception 
during treatment with trastuzumab emtansine and for 
6 months after treatment has concluded, and that 
male patients or their female partners should also use 
effective contraception. 
SmPC Section 5.3, Preclinical safety data, Impairment 
of fertility and teratogenicity 
Labeling states that dedicated fertility studies have not 
been conducted with trastuzumab emtansine, and that 
although developmental toxicity of trastuzumab was 
not predicted in the non-clinical program, it has been 
identified in the clinical setting. It is also noted that 
developmental toxicity of maytansine has been 
identified in non-clinical studies, suggesting that DM1 
may be similarly teratogenic and potentially 
embryotoxic.

Labeling states that it is not known whether 
trastuzumab emtansine is excreted in human milk; that 
women should discontinue nursing prior to initiating 
treatment with trastuzumab emtansine since many 
drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the 
potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing 
infants from trastuzumab emtansine; and that women 
may begin nursing 6 months after concluding 
treatment.

SmPC Section 5.2, Pharmacokinetic properties, Other 
special populations 
It is noted that most patients in clinical studies were 
females and that as a result the effect of gender on the 
pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab emtansine was not 
formally evaluated. 
The incidence of anti-therapeutic antibodies -positivity 
is relatively low, making it difficult to reach a firm 
conclusion about its impact.

SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Physicians are advised of the potential for an immune 
response to trastuzumab emtansine, and an overview is 
provided of anti-therapeutic antibody responses to 
trastuzumab emtansine in the clinical studies. It is stated 
that the presence of ATAs did not appear to have an 
impact on the PK, safety profile and treatment 
effectiveness of trastuzumab emtansine. 
SPC Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration  
Physicians are advised that patients treated with 
Kadcyla should have HER2 positive tumour status, 
defined as a score of 3 + by immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) or a ratio of ≥ 2.0 by in situ hybridization (ISH) 
assessed by a CE-marked In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) 
medical device. If a CE-marked IVD is not available, 
the HER2-status should be assessed by an alternate 
validated test.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pivotal Phase III trial (TDM4370g/BO21977, EMILIA) of trastuzumab emtansine in metastatic 
breast cancer patients previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab, and several supportive 
studies, showed that trastuzumab emtansine is associated with a statistically and clinically 
significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to lapatinib 
plus capecitabine. There was a 35% reduction in the risk of PD or death (HR = 0.650, 95% 
CI: 0.549, 0.771, p<0.0001) and increased median PFS of 9.6 months vs. 6.4 months. The 
robustness of the PFS finding was confirmed by sensitivity analyses. For OS, the HR was 0.682 
(95% CI: 0.548, 0.849, p=0.0006). The estimated median duration of survival was 25.1 months 
in patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine and 30.9 months in patients treated with 
trastuzumab emtansine.  
There was a consistent improvement in secondary efficacy endpoints, including IRC-assessed 
ORR (43.3% vs. 30.8%, difference 12.7% [6.0%, 19.4%]; p = 0.0002), DOR (median 12.6 as 
compared to 6.5 months), and time to treatment failure (TTF; the time from randomization to 
discontinuation of treatment for any reason; median 7.9 months as compared to 5.8 months).  
Response rates were also more durable (the DOR in the trastuzumab emtansine arm was almost 
double that in the lapatinib and capecitabine arm). 
To date most studies in MBC have failed to demonstrate an appreciable difference in PRO 
between standard of care therapy and experimental agents. In contrast, treatment with 
trastuzumab emtansine appeared to confer a longer time to symptom progression (TSP), and 
hence a better quality of life, compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine. However, due to the 
open label character of the study, no conclusions can be drawn.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Even though the clinical relevance of the pivotal OS results recently published is acknowledged, 
the results are based on an interim analysis that had a limited number of events and duration 
of follow-up. To ensure that early events have not biased the estimation, the applicant will 
submit an updated analysis (see Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures). 
Assessment report                                                                                                                                          Page 116/121 
EMA/749228/2013                                                                                                   
 
 
  
  
A consistent treatment benefit of trastuzumab emtansine was seen in the majority of pre-
specified subgroups evaluated, supporting the robustness of the overall result. As regards as a 
possibly reduced benefit in the older subgroup of patients, the interpretation is difficult due to 
the low number of patients. The results of the subgroup analysis by age are reflected in section 
5.1 of the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The size of the safety database and the exposure are considered adequate to allow assessment 
and characterization of the safety profile of T-DM1. Standard methods have been used for the 
detection and reporting of adverse events. As expected based on the well-characterised 
toxicities associated with the respective components of these regimens, the most common AEs 
(>20%) reported in the T-DM1 group of the pivotal study were nausea (39.2%), fatigue 
(35.1%), thrombocytopenia (28.0%), headache (27.1%), diarrhea (23.3%), AST increased 
(22.4%), decreased appetite (20.6%) and epistaxis (20.2%). In comparison, the most common 
AEs in the lapatinib+capecitabine arm were diarrhea (79.7%), Palmar-Plantar 
Erythrodyseastesia (PPE) syndrome (58.0%), nausea (44.7%), vomiting (29.3%), rash 
(26.6%) and decreased appetite (23.2%). 
The overall safety profile of T-DM1 is considered sufficiently characterised. No specific safety 
concerns are evident in older patients (≥65 years) treated with T-DM1, although the number of 
patients older than 75 years is very limited.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and neuropathy are the most important recorded AEs, and 
those that more frequently led to T-DM1 dose reduction in the pivotal trial. Further 
investigation on T-DM1 induced hepatic toxicity and neuropathy is needed in order to envisage 
appropriate and effective risk minimisation procedures (see RMP). In addition, a number of AEs 
known to be associated with trastuzumab use, infusion-related (IRR) and hypersensitivity 
reactions, severe pulmonary events and cardiac dysfunction, are assumed to occur also with T-
DM1 and need to be continuously monitored (see RMP).  
A priority review of missing cases of suspected adverse drug reactions is ongoing in the context 
of the assessment of deficiencies in the applicant’s safety reporting system. In light of the 
significant clinical benefit of Kadcyla it is considered acceptable to receive the data post-
authorisation (see RMP).  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Trastuzumab emtansine demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy 
both against lapatinib plus capecitabine in several MBC subpopulations in pre-treated patients 
(including heavily pre-treated patients with few alternatives). The gain in PFS and in OS over 
standard therapy is considered clinically relevant. On the basis of the magnitude of the benefit 
in PFS and OS, the favourable effects of T-DM1 in the treatment of MBC are considered

important. The evidence of efficacy is sufficiently robust. The safety profile of T-DM1 appears 
overall manageable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of trastuzumab emtansine is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Trastuzumab emtansine confers relevant clinical efficacy together with an acceptable and 
manageable toxicity across a range of clinical scenarios as regards previous line of treatment. 
The safety profile of T-DM1 compares favourably to that of available alternatives (lapatinib in 
combination with capecitabine) and appears sufficiently manageable, although some AEs need 
further clarifications and investigations and additional safety information in patients with prior 
exposure to trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab will be provided on an ongoing basis (see RMP). 
The beneficial effects are considered to outweigh the risks associated with T-DM1 therapy. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Kadcyla in the following indication “Kadcyla, as a 
single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive, unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, 
separately or in combination. Patients should have either received prior therapy for locally 
advanced or metastatic disease, or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of 
completing adjuvant therapy.” is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

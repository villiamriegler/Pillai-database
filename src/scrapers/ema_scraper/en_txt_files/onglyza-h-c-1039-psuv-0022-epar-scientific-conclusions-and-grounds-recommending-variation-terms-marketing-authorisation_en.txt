Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Onglyza, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC should be updated by adding ‘diarrhoea’ as adverse reaction with a 
frequency of ‘common’. The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly. The update of this 
section is based on two cases from clinical trials with positive de- and rechallenge plus 11 
spontaneously reported cases with factors of positive de- and/or rechallenges, and given that it is a 
known ADR for the other DPP4-inhibitors as well. In regard to the assigned frequency, a total of 106 
ADRs of diarrhoea were reported in 2042 patients in a 5-study pooled safety analysis. In a 20-study 
pooled from Hirshberg et al, 63 ADRs of diarrhoea were reported in 978 patients. Diarrhoea should 
therefore be ranked under the frequency of ‘common (≥1/100 to <1/10)’ according to the 
guidance provided in the SmPC Guideline. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Onglyza, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance saxagliptin is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a serious, chronic, type 2 inflammatory, immune-mediated disease of 
the esophagus. 
The MAH’s initially claimed therapeutic indication was: 
“Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents 12 years 
and older who are inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to, or who are not candidates for 
conventional medicinal therapy.” 
Epidemiology 
The prevalence of EoE is estimated at 22.7 per 100,000 worldwide and has been increasing. 
Eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported in all ages. However, most cases are in children and adults 
younger than 50 years. Gender differences in EoE have been consistently reported, with males affected 
3 to 4 times more often than females, but there are no known gender-related differences in disease 
biology, clinical manifestations, severity, or natural history of the disease. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The disease is characterized by type 2 inflammation with esophageal eosinophilia leading to symptoms 
of esophageal dysfunction. Growing evidence suggests that a type 2 cytokine-mediated immune 
response plays an important role in the development of EoE. Patients with EoE have increased levels of 
esophageal inflammatory infiltrates, including eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils, as 
well as type 2-associated chemokines and cytokines, such as eotaxin-3, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and 
IL-13. In particular, mRNA expression of IL4, IL-5, and IL-13 is increased in the esophagus of patients 
with EoE compared with in controls. Esophageal biopsies and blood samples of patients with active EoE 
have increased levels of the type 2 prototypical cytokines and chemokines including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-
13. Eosinophilic esophagitis is also distinguished by the expression of a unique esophageal 
transcriptome and the interplay of early life environmental factors with distinct genetic susceptibility 
elements at 5q22 (thymic and stromal lymphopoietin [TSLP]) and 2p23 (calpain 14 [CAPN14]). 
CAPN14 is overexpressed by the esophageal epithelia in patients with EoE. Unlike TSLP, which is 
associated with multiple allergic disorders, CAPN14 may account for the tissue specificity of esophageal 
disease in EoE because CAPN14 invokes a pathway that alters basic epithelial cell functions, including 
barrier integrity. 
The induction of eotaxin-3, an eosinophil chemoattractant, is thought to be an important factor in EoE 
pathogenesis. The two most up-regulated genes in esophageal biopsies from EoE patients (compared 
to normal controls) encode eotaxin-3 and periostin, another protein induced by type 2 cytokines and 
thought to promote inflammation and remodeling. Furthermore, esophageal biopsies and blood 
samples of patients with active EoE have increased levels of cytokines and chemokines associated with 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 8/179 
 
 
 
 
type 2 inflammation, including IL-4 and IL-13, TSLP, and eotaxin-3 secreted by cells involved in 
allergic inflammation: T cells, mast cells, basophils, invariant natural killer T cells, and esophageal 
epithelial cells. Mutations in the eotaxin-3 and TSLP genes, whose functions propagate type 2 
inflammation, have been associated with EoE risk. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The primary clinical manifestations of EoE in both adults and children over 10 years of age are 
dysphagia and food impaction. Other clinical manifestations such as heartburn, diarrhea and weight 
loss have also been reported. The symptoms lead to substantially impaired quality of life (QOL). 
Patients with advanced fibrostenotic disease live with frequent symptoms while eating as well as 
anxiety and fear regarding meals. As the disease progresses, the fibrosis/strictures that develop may 
result in food impaction in the esophagus. Food impaction is a traumatic event for patients and often 
requires medical intervention, including emergency room visits for manual removal to relieve the 
impaction. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is the underlying cause of approximately 50% of the food 
impaction cases that present in the emergency department. 
Complications of EoE include food impaction, strictures, esophageal dysmotility, increased esophageal 
infections, aspiration, and spontaneous esophageal rupture. Food impaction can occur at any stage of 
the disease, either as an initial manifestation of EoE or after many years of EoE disease duration. 
Dysphagia, food impaction and regurgitation may increase the risk for aspiration, including aspiration 
pneumonia. Esophageal inflammation in EoE may also result in esophageal perforation. Most cases of 
esophageal perforation are due to undiagnosed or untreated EoE. Although fungal infections are a 
complication of topical corticosteroids, esophageal candidiasis may also occur spontaneously in 
patients with EoE. 
Diagnostic criteria for EoE include the presence of clinical symptoms and ≥15 eosinophils per high-
power field (eos/hpf; 400X) in mucosal esophageal biopsies. Approximately 90% of patients have 
associated endoscopic findings, including fixed or transient concentric rings, longitudinal furrows, white 
plaques, edema, fragile or crepe-like mucosa, and/or stricture. Edema, rings and furrows are common 
endoscopic features, seen in at least half of patients. The severity of esophageal rings scored using the 
EoE Endoscopic Reference Score is correlated with the risk of food impaction. 
Patients with EoE have substantially impaired QOL. Reduction in the quality of life may be due to: 1) 
symptoms, such as dysphagia or food impaction, which may result in the need to cough, gag, or vomit 
to dislodge food, 2) diagnostic procedures, including the repeated endoscopic probing of the 
esophagus, and 3) behaviours to avoid symptoms, such as dietary modification (food avoidance) and 
prolongation of meal times, leading to avoidance of social dining. The true burden of disease for 
patients is likely underestimated due to compensatory behaviours. These dietary modifications and 
compensatory behaviours can cause psychosocial issues for patients. Overall, this serious disease 
results in substantial morbidity for the affected patient and impairs several aspects of quality of life 
including social functioning, emotional well-being, and productivity by disrupting one of the basic 
activities of daily living, namely eating. 
Management 
Management of EoE is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Current therapeutic 
approaches include chronic dietary elimination, conventional medicinal therapies, and esophageal 
dilation. The combination of diet modification and conventional medicinal therapies (swallowed topical 
corticosteroid formulations [orodispersible budesonide (Jorveza)]) can be effective in the management 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 9/179 
 
 
 
 
of some patients with EoE. However, long term compliance is often a challenge, and when these 
approaches are stopped, patients typically experience a recurrence of symptoms. As many as 25% of 
patients may have significant ongoing symptoms, despite treatment with dietary modification and 
corticosteroids. Furthermore, a significant portion of patients do not respond to corticosteroids, and 
those who do respond may not have sustained benefit, a critical limitation for this chronic disease. 
Endoscopic dilation can provide immediate relief but carries a risk (albeit low) of serious complications 
due to esophageal perforation and does not have any impact on the underlying inflammatory 
pathology of EoE. 
Diet modification can be an effective way to manage EoE by removing immunogenic dietary antigens 
or triggers of inflammation and thereby reduce symptoms of disease. However, these diets are very 
difficult for patients to adhere to, and can lead to decreased QoL and feelings of social isolation. 
Therefore, diet modification is limited as a long-term solution for management of EoE. 
Conventional medicinal therapy for EoE typically includes off-label proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage 
and use of systemic or topical corticosteroids. Proton-pump inhibitors are an important conventional 
treatment option for EoE. In addition to acid-suppression properties, PPIs have anti-inflammatory 
properties that impact the pathobiology of EoE. Proton-pump inhibitors inhibit IL-4-stimulated eotaxin-
3 expression in EoE esophageal cells and block STAT6 binding to the promoter. Studies have shown 
approximately 50% of EoE patients respond to treatment with high-dose PPIs. Long-term use of PPIs, 
however, has been associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and may be associated 
with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. There are no 
prospective, double-blind, randomized trials comparing the efficacies of corticosteroids to PPI or 
elimination diet to PPI. 
Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment and other presentations (e.g., inhaler) have been 
adapted off-label worldwide to allow oral administration via swallowing: fluticasone is used orally as a 
spray from a metered-dose inhaler, and budesonide as a viscous preparation. Jorveza (budesonide) is 
an orodispersible tablet specifically formulated for swallowed topical use and is approved only in the EU 
for treatment of patients 18 years of age and older with EoE. While swallowed topical corticosteroids 
are often effective in quickly reducing eosinophilic esophageal inflammation, as shown in randomized 
controlled trials, there are limited data on long-term safety or efficacy of such agents.  
Chronic inflammation of the esophagus leads to fibrosis, tissue damage, and tissue remodelling. 
Studies have shown that the presence of more severe endoscopic findings is associated with food-
impaction history and that those findings also correlated with impaired esophageal distensibility. In 
patients with fibrostenotic phenotype (fixed rings or strictures), esophageal dilation is often necessary 
to relieve symptoms. Balloons or wire-guided bougies are used to induce a mucosal tear to 
mechanically open the esophagus in order to improve symptoms. Esophageal dilations are not a cure 
for EoE but rather provide temporary relief of dysphagia by increasing the patency of the esophagus. 
However, this improvement in esophageal patency is not long-lived if the underlying disease remains 
untreated. 
In summary, the current available medicinal therapies for EoE are limited due to variable response 
rates and variable symptom improvement, relapse after therapy cessation, failure to show sustained 
benefit, the potential for side effects and adverse effects on QoL. Therefore, an unmet need is seen for 
safe and effective treatment options that address the underlying inflammation of EoE to prevent the 
disease progression and improve clinical symptoms in adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
inadequately controlled by, intolerant to, or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 
signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-
13 receptor complexes. It inhibits IL-4 signaling via the type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and 
IL-13 signaling through the type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα). Blocking IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits 
IL-4 and IL-13 type 2 cytokine-induced responses, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, and IgE.  
Dupilumab is currently approved for the following indications: atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and 
chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis (PN) (commission decision 
pending).  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
A Scientific Advice, with implications for the present Application was received from the CHMP in 2018 
(EMEA/H/SA/2744/7/2018/II). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that the clinical studies presented in this dossier were conducted in accordance with 
the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with 
the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
No new quality data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Justification regarding existing Drug-Device Combination 
In 3.2.R Regional information justifications have been provided regarding the use of the existing Medical 
Device Part of the Drug-Device Combination (DDC) 300 mg PFS, PFS-S and PFP for the introduction of 
the  Eosinophilic  esophagitis  indication  for  the  adolescent  (12  to  17  years  of  age)  and  adult  patient 
population. 
Change assessment towards MDR Article 117 (PFS, PFS-S, PFP) 
The MAH has determined that there are  no  changes to the design or intended purpose  of the device 
(part), nor is there a new medical device  being introduced. Therefore, a Notified Body  opinion is not 
required. The details of the MAH´s assessment are as follows: 
• There is no impact on the medical device clinical use; as it will still be administered with the same 
procedure and at the same injection sites (abdomen, upper thigh regions and upper arm).  
•  There  are  no  changes  to  the  medical  device  instructions  for  use  related  to  the  new  therapeutic 
indication. 
•  There is no change to the intended users;  the  self-administration patient  characteristics (functional 
capabilities/impairment such as perceptual, cognitive, manual dexterity, other comorbidities) are equal 
to the currently approved population.

Usability Studies 
The MAH has determined that there is no need for additional Usability Studies. 
The  quality,  safety  and/or  efficacy  of  the  DDC  product  are  not  affected  as  the  assessment  results 
conclude the following: 
•  There  are  no  changes  to  the  medical  device  instructions  for  use  related  to  the  new  therapeutic 
indication. 
• There are no changes to the performance requirements, nor the specifications of the medical device. 
• No new or different risks in relation to the medical device use have been identified, therefore no new 
mitigations need to be introduced. The existing Risk Management File will be updated as part of the life 
cycle management activities. The hazard list is already covering this new therapeutic indication. 
No need for additional Usability Studies; usability for the PFS, PFS-S and PFP is supported by human 
factors data that may be bridging data to the same identical device part used with the patient populations 
tested to support the approved indications. 
The  intended  user  population  is  unchanged  versus  the  DDC  currently  authorised,  as  the  self-
administration patient characteristics (functional capabilities/impairment such as perceptual, cognitive, 
manual dexterity, other comorbidities) are equivalent to the currently approved populations. Therefore, 
the bridging data demonstrated the effective use of the DDC by the same intended user population.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on quality 
No new quality data have been submitted in this application. 
The proposed new Eosinophilic esophagitis indication for the adolescent (12 to 17 years of age) and 
adult patient population does not result in the introduction of a new medical device or a modification to 
the design, or aforementioned intended use/purpose of the medical device part of the Drug Device 
Combination (DDC). Therefore, it is agreed that the variation application supporting the new 
therapeutic indication does not require a Notified Body Opinion (NBOp) for the currently authorised 
DDC.  
The age group of the intended patient population of adults and 12 to 17-year-old adolescents is 
covered by authorised indications. 
It is agreed that there is no need for additional Usability Studies as the new therapeutic indication has 
no impact on the 1) intended users, 2) the clinical use, and 3) use-related risks. In addition, there is 
no difference in the medical device instructions for use compared with the authorised instructions. 
From a quality point of view, the MAH’s justifications regarding the use of the existing Medical Device 
Part of the DDC 300 mg PFS, PFS-S and PFP for the new therapeutic indication in the adolescent (12 to 
17 years of age) and adult patient population is accepted.

2.2.3.  Conclusion on the quality aspects 
The available quality data do not raise concern in the indication. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A  claim  of  exclusion  from  submission  of  environmental  risk  assessment  studies  is  made  according  to 
Section 2 of the 2006 CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human  Use  (ERA  Guideline  corr  2)  because  dupilumab  is  a  monoclonal  antibody  consisting  of  linked 
naturally occurring amino acids. Per  the ERA Guideline, vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, 
proteins,  carbohydrates  and  lipids  are  exempt  from  ERA  study  requirements because  by  their  nature 
they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
The claim for ERA exemption by the MAH is justified and in conformity with the ERA guideline since the 
type II variation request concerns a monoclonal antibody consisting of naturally occurring amino acids. 
Dupilumab  is  significantly  metabolized  in-vivo  and  is  expected  to  be  readily  and  rapidly  degraded  in 
wastewater treatment systems and in the environment. The antibody’s structure and mode of action do 
not indicate any specific risk to the environment. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The available non-clinical data do not raise concern in the indication. 
There are no new non clinical data submitted in support of this indication. Dupilumab is a monoclonal 
antibody consisting of naturally occurring amino acids. The intended use does not lead to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure.  
- Considering the above data, dupilumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of functional dupilumab in serum has previously been extensively described in healthy subjects 
and in participants with AD, asthma, or CRSwNP. The PK of dupilumab is characterized as non-linear 
with parallel linear and target-mediated elimination pathways, with the target-mediated pathway 
expressing a high degree of non-linearity. As drug concentrations increase and become sufficient to 
saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK of dupilumab moves to a linear and dose-proportional 
profile. 
The presence and type of type 2 inflammatory disease studied to date does not influence the PK or PD 
of dupilumab. Dupilumab is well absorbed after SC administration, characterized by parallel non-
saturable catabolic and target-mediated disposition; the estimated bioavailability of 61% to 64% has 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 14/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistently been reported in patients with type 2 inflammatory conditions. Body weight is the primary 
covariate influencing the distribution and elimination of dupilumab. After accounting for body weight in 
adults and paediatric participants ≥6 years, age does not affect the PK of dupilumab. 
The PK of dupilumab in adult and adolescent participants with EoE was assessed in the supportive 
phase 2 study R668-EE-1324, phase 3 pivotal study R668-EE-1774 Part A, Part B, and Part A/C, 
population PK (PopPK) analysis and comparison analyses of PK across studies. 
Dupilumab Drug Concentrations in Serum Across EoE Studies 
Trough concentration-time profiles for functional dupilumab concentrations across study R668-EE-1774 
Part A and Part B and study R668-EE-1324 are shown in the Figure below. Trough concentrations at 
steady state in EoE study participants following either the dupilumab 300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W 
regimen were consistent with those observed in other indications. 
Figure 1 Mean (SD) Concentrations of Functional Dupilumab in Serum by Time and Treatment 
Group in Adult and Adolescent Participants with Eosinophilic Esophagitis Receiving Dupilumab 
300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W (R668-EE-1774 Part A and Part B and R668-EE-1324, PKAS) 
Mean trough concentration in participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg QW, measured 1 week after 
the initial 600 mg loading dose was 72.7 mg/L. Upon weekly dosing, trough concentrations increased 
to 171 mg/L at week 12. The week 12 concentrations of dupilumab in serum were similar across EoE 
Studies R668-EE-1324 and R668-EE-1774 Parts A and B.  
Similarity between mean dupilumab concentrations at weeks 12 and 24 in Part A and Part B of Study 
R668-EE-1774 for participants treated with dupilumab suggest that concentrations are at or near 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 15/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
steady-state within 12 weeks of initiating treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W 
when administered without a loading dose. 
The consistency in trough concentration at week 12 between study R668-EE-1324, which included a 
dupilumab 600 mg loading dose, and study R668-EE-1774, in which no loading dose was used, shows 
that the loading dose had no influence on the steady-state trough concentration obtained at week 12. 
The consistency in trough concentration with dupilumab 300 mg QW is illustrated again at week 24 
when comparing the mean concentrations from Part A and Part B of study R668-EE-1774. 
Considering the difference in dosing interval between the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W 
dosing regimens, the steady-state trough concentration observed at week 12 and week 24 for the 300 
mg Q2W dosing regimen are as predicted from a model-based analysis and consistent with dupilumab 
concentrations following the 300 mg QW dosing regimen. 
Absorption 
Dupilumab is generally well absorbed following SC administration with an estimated absolute 
bioavailability of 61% to 64% based on a previous population PK analysis of healthy subjects and 
participants with asthma or AD. Given the ability of the global population PK model to accurately and 
effectively describe the PK in the patient population with EoE, the model confirms similar bioavailability 
in the EoE population. 
Distribution 
The estimated volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) for the EoE population from the population 
PK model was 4.49 L. This value is similar to the value obtained for the previous population PK analysis 
of healthy subjects and participants with asthma or AD. For more detail on the absorption and 
distribution profile of dupilumab, refer to the initial AD marketing application. 
Elimination 
Linear and non-linear clearance parameters in participants with EoE are consistent with that observed 
following administration of dupilumab in AD and asthma patient populations and, therefore, the time to 
reach non-detectable concentrations after the last steady-state dose is the same across adult and 
adolescent populations. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dupilumab is characterized by parallel linear and non-linear target-mediated kinetics. This non-linear 
PK profile is observed at drug concentrations below that required to saturate the target-mediated 
pathway, resulting in a greater than dose proportional increase in exposure. As drug concentrations 
increase to levels greater than those required to saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK profile 
reverts to a linear and dose-proportional profile. For further details of dose proportionality, refer to the 
initial adult AD marketing application. 
Participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W, including participants in study R668-EE-
1774 Part A, Part B, and Part A/C, achieved concentrations saturating the non-linear clearance 
pathway throughout the duration of the dosing interval. This is demonstrated by the approximate 
dose-proportionality (as measured by steady-state area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 
over a normalized 2-week dose interval) between the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW regimens. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 16/179 
 
 
 
 
Saturation of the non-linear clearance pathway can be considered a necessary but insufficient criterion 
to maximize target engagement and may not always translate to full efficacy, if, for example, drug 
distribution to a deeper tissue compartment is required for complete efficacy 
Trough concentrations of functional dupilumab were at or near steady state by week 12 in participants 
receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW based on simulated profiles of the entire 
concentration-time course over 24 weeks using the re-estimated population PK model, which included 
22 pooled studies including EoE data. 
For adults (≥18 years of age) and adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age) with EoE, the proposed dose 
regimen is 300 mg QW without a loading dose. The proposed posology is supported by results of study 
R668-EE-1774 (Part A, Part B, and Part A/C), in which no loading dose was administered. A total 
loading dose of 600 mg SC was administered in study R668-EE-1324. The decision to not use a loading 
dose in the phase 3 study R668-EE-1774 was informed by the well-established observation that a 
loading dose, while effective at achieving higher systemic concentrations sooner and reducing the time 
and number of dosing intervals needed to achieve steady state, has no influence on the steady-state 
concentrations and, hence, efficacy at week 24. 
Despite the limitation that the measures of dysphagia were different between study R668-EE-1324 
(Straumann Dysphagia Instrument [SDI]) and study R668-EE-1774 (Dysphagia Symptom 
Questionnaire (DSQ) total score), changes from baseline relative to placebo followed a similar time 
course indicating that administration of a loading dose did not impact onset of effect for the 300 mg 
QW regimen. Lack of the loading dose in the phase 3 study R668-EE-1774 is not related to the 
observed lack of efficacy in reducing dysphagia symptoms at week 24 with the 300 mg Q2W regimen. 
Administration of a loading dose reduces the time to reach steady state but does not affect steady-
state exposures (maximum concentration, trough concentration, AUC). This is demonstrated by 
similarity of the week 12 concentration of dupilumab in serum across EoE studies R668-EE-1324 
(loading dose) and R668-EE-1774 Part A and Part B (no loading dose). 
The implication for DSQ response is that loading dose, in the best case, may potentially result in a 
greater response earlier for the 300 mg Q2W regimen but will not affect the magnitude of response at 
week 24. Given that the PK of an mAb is characterized by relatively slow clearance, the dose-response 
of the 300 mg QW regimen (without a loading dose) over the first 4 weeks of therapy can be taken as 
a surrogate of the dose response of 300 mg Q2W regimen with a loading dose. The relatively small 
difference between the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W regimens in the DSQ total score 
mean change from baseline response at week 4 does not explain the large difference in mean change 
from baseline response observed at week 24 between these regimens. 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Affecting Pharmacokinetics 
•  Body Weight 
PK assessments identified body weight as the primary covariate affecting the PK of dupilumab, with an 
increase in concentration with a decrease in body weight. Across studies, dupilumab 300 mg QW has 
been studied in adult participants with AD (phases 2 and 3), asthma (phase 2), or CRSwNP (phase 2) 
with body weight as low as 42 kg. Supportive safety data from the studies using the 300 mg QW dose 
regimen in adults (≥42 kg), provided the rationale for the use of dupilumab 300 mg QW dose regimen 
in adult and adolescent participants with EoE with body weight ≥40 kg. Dupilumab 300 mg QW has not 
been studied in EoE participants with a body weight <40 kg as patients (adults or adolescents) with 
body weight <40 kg were excluded from study R668-EE-1774. 
•  Age 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 17/179 
 
 
 
 
Population PK analyses of dupilumab across adult (≥18 years), adolescent (≥12 to <18 years), and 
paediatric (≥6 to <12 years) patients with AD have demonstrated that after accounting for body 
weight, age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the PK of dupilumab. This is further 
confirmed by the ability of the global population PK model to describe dupilumab PK in the EoE 
population where body weight and not age was a covariate in the model. Based on observed data, 
once weight differences between adults and adolescents are accounted for, drug concentrations in 
serum are similar between both age groups. 
To facilitate a comparison of dupilumab exposure in adult and adolescent participants of lighter body 
weights, mean steady state trough concentrations of dupilumab following administration of 300 mg QW 
were compared across studies of adult and adolescent participants with EoE, asthma, AD or CRSwNP 
weighing <70 kg.

Mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations of dupilumab at Week 52 for adolescent participants 
(aged ≥12 to <18 years; mean [SD] baseline body weight 61.1 [13.7] kg) with EoE that received 
dupilumab 300 mg QW in R668-EE-1774 Part A/C were 176 ±83.2 mg/L (N=18). These observed 
mean dupilumab concentrations were within the range of variability for dupilumab concentrations at 
Week 52 in adult participants with EoE (≥18 years; mean [SD] baseline body weight 86.4 [19.0] kg) 
who also received dupilumab 300 mg QW in R668-EE-1774 Part A/C (134 ±69.8 mg/L, N=49). 
In adolescents initially randomized to receive placebo during the double-blind treatment period 
followed by dupilumab 300 mg QW upon entering Part C (Placebo/Dupilumab 300 mg QW), mean (SD) 
steady state concentrations of dupilumab at Week 52 were 141 ±97.5 mg/L (N=10) compared to 155 
±97.0 mg/L (N=27) in adults. The mean (SD) weight of the adolescent participants was 71.5 ±20.7 kg 
(range 50 to 118 kg) and the mean (SD) weight of the adults was 83.0 ±17.9 kg (range 60.1 to 132 
kg). In adolescent participants who received dupilumab 300 mg QW throughout the entire study 
period, mean (SD) steady state trough concentrations of dupilumab at Week 52 were 201 ±142 mg/L 
(N=21) compared to 164 ±108 mg/L in adults (N=45) receiving the same regimen. Mean (SD) weight 
of the adolescent and adult participants was 61.8 ±11.5 kg (range 40.3 to 92.8 kg) and 79.8 ±18.1 kg 
(range 43.5 to 133 kg), respectively. 
A scatter plot of the steady state concentrations at Week 52 by baseline body weight and age group in 
adult and adolescent participants with EoE who received dupilumab 300 mg QW in R668-EE-1774 Part 
B/C is presented below: 
Figure 2 Scatter Plot of Concentrations of Functional Dupilumab in Serum at Week 52 by Baseline 
Body Weight and Age Group in Adult and Adolescent Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis 
Receiving 300 mg QW (Study R668-EE-1774, Part B/C) 
Based on the scatter plot of Week 52 trough dupilumab concentrations, adolescents and adults with 
similar body weight exhibited similar dupilumab exposures following administration of 300 mg QW. The 
52-week data in adolescent EoE participants who received 300 mg QW in Part B/C are therefore 
consistent with the data previously reported for Part A/C, and are also within the range of variability 
previously reported for the 300 mg QW regimen in adults (≥18 years). 
In addition, a pooled analysis of mean steady state trough concentrations of dupilumab by body weight 
category has also been conducted for participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg QW. Although mean 
trough concentrations of dupilumab in participants weighing ≥40 kg to ≤50 kg were higher than trough 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023

concentrations in participants weighing >50 kg, individual data indicated that adolescents and adults 
with similar body weight exhibited overlapping exposure. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dupilumab treatment provides a marked reduction in downstream effectors of the type 2 immune 
response and in EoE-associated inflammation. Both Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine 
(TARC) and eotaxin-3 responses were similar across EoE studies and were indiscriminatory of dose 
regimen (300 mg QW versus 300 mg Q2W). 
The magnitude and time course of TARC response in EoE participants were similar to that observed in 
asthma and CRSwNP participants. However, the magnitude of TARC response was markedly higher in 
AD participants (2-fold higher percent change from baseline), indicating a higher sensitivity of the 
biomarker to drug effect in AD. 
Exposure-Response Relationships 
Exposure-response (E-R) relationships on both histologic infiltration of eosinophils in the esophagus 
and the absolute and percent change from baseline in DSQ total score show that the dupilumab 300 
mg QW regimen is associated with histologic and clinical efficacy in EoE participants. In contrast, dose-
response and E-R relationships showed that the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W regimen was not 
differentiated from placebo on change from baseline in DSQ total score response but showed similar 
differentiation to the 300 QW regimen on histologic endpoints.  
Exposure-safety analysis showed little evidence for an E-R relationship between dupilumab trough 
concentration and AESIs at week 24. 
Immunogenicity 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA-positive responses was low, <5% in all treatment groups. 
The available immunogenicity data did not show a clinically significant effect of ADA on safety. There 
was no clear association between injection site reactions or other commonly related treatment-
emergent adverse events and the development of ADA. However, due to the small number of 
participants who were ADA positive, meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn. 
In Pool 2a (phase 3 placebo-controlled pooled study parts), a transient, treatment-emergent ADA-
positive response was seen in 1.5% (3/195) of participants receiving dupilumab and 0.8% (1/118) in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. In Pool 2b (phase 2 and phase 3 placebo-controlled pooled study 
parts), a transient treatment-emergent ADA-positive response was seen in 1.4% (3/218) of 
participants receiving dupilumab and 0.7% (1/141) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A population modelling analysis was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab 
in patients with EoE, including data from the Phase 2 study (Study R668-EE-1324) in adults with EoE 
and the Phase 3 Study (R668-EE-1774) in adult (≥18 years old) and adolescent EoE patients (≥12 to 
<18 years old).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 20/179 
 
 
 
 
A global population PK (PopPK) model was previously developed to characterize dupilumab 
concentration data from healthy subjects and patients with AD or asthma. This model, developed from 
a large dataset in three different populations, was intended to serve as a robust starting point for 
PopPK analyses of dupilumab in other Th2- mediated inflammatory diseases, such as EoE. In the 
current analysis, an external visual predictive check (VPC) was performed to assess whether 
dupilumab PK is consistent between patients with EoE and other populations. Dupilumab PK data from 
patients with EoE was subsequently combined with PK data from previous dupilumab studies in healthy 
subjects and patients with AD or asthma, and the previous population PK model was re-fit to the 
combined data-set including patents with EoE. 
The primary objectives of the population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis were to: 
•  Assess the PK of dupilumab in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) using an external 
validation approach with a PopPK model developed for dupilumab in healthy subjects and 
patients with asthma or AD; 
•  Update the PopPK model developed for dupilumab in healthy subjects and patients with asthma 
or AD with the addition of PK data in patients with EoE; 
• 
Investigate the effects of selected EoE covariates on PK parameters; 
•  Generate individual subject PK parameters and exposure predictions across patient 
populations. 
Studies Included in the Population Modelling Analysis 
Dupilumab concentration-time data from 20 clinical studies (eight Phase 1, seven Phase 2, and five 
Phase 3 studies) in healthy adult subjects, adult patients with AD, and adult (≥18 years old) and 
adolescent (≥12 to <18 years old) patients with asthma supported the previously developed global 
population PK model. Two additional studies, a Phase 2 study in adult patients with EoE and a Phase 3 
study in adult and adolescent patients with EoE were included in the analysis.

note: available for patients in R668-EE-1774 only. 
Data were classified as outliers using the population conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) and 
individual weighted residuals (IWRES). Observations with |CWRES|>6 or |IWRES|>6 were considered 
potential outliers. The influence of these outliers was evaluated by comparing estimates of the key 
model parameters (i.e., linear elimination constant [KEL] and distribution volume of the central 
compartment [Vc]) from model fits on data with and without the outliers. The outliers were considered 
influential if key parameter estimates differed by more than 15%. 
Modelling Methodology 
The general approach of this modelling analysis was to perform an external VPC to assess the 
consistency of dupilumab PK in patients with EoE with other populations, using the previously 
developed PopPK global model for dupilumab in healthy subjects and patients with asthma or AD. 
Following the external VPC, the population PK model was re-fit to an updated dataset combining data 
from patients with EoE with the pooled dataset from the global model. Parameter re-estimation 
included determining the impact of the previously evaluated demographic covariate of body weight in 
the updated pooled dataset. In addition, covariate effects to explain potential differences in dupilumab 
PK between patient populations were to be evaluated, if necessary. An internal VPC was performed on 
the updated final model following the re-estimation of the parameter effects to verify the predictive 
performance of the updated final model was adequate. Finally, the updated final model was used to 
generate post-hoc estimates of individual PK parameters and exposure predictions for each of the 
patient populations (i.e., EoE, asthma and AD). An exploratory assessment of covariates specific to 
EoE was performed.

Figure 3 Flow Chart of Planned Model Development 
Model development was based on the following criteria: 
o  Successful minimization and completion of covariance steps in NONMEM®; 
o  Precision of parameter estimates; 
o  Assessment of standard goodness-of-fit plots; 
o  Reductions in NONMEM® objective function value (OFV) for hierarchical models; and, 
o  Reductions in residual variability. 
In addition, the stability of the models throughout the model development process was monitored. To 
avoid ill-conditioning, inspection of the covariance matrix of estimates at every stage of model 
development was performed in order to verify that extreme pairwise correlations (ρ > 0.95) of the 
parameters were not encountered. The condition number of the correlation matrix of the parameter 
estimates (i.e., the ratio of the largest to smallest eigenvalues) was also assessed to ensure values 
less than 1000. Values greater than 1000 are indicative of a severely ill-conditioned model. If during 
the course of model development convergence or covariance estimation problems occurred, ad hoc 
NONMEM® runs were to be performed to evaluate the nature of the ill-conditioning. 
An external visual predictive check (VPC) was performed using the previously developed model (two 
compartment disposition model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten elimination and first-order SC 
absorption) to predict dupilumab concentrations in EoE patients. Parameter estimates were fixed to 
their final values from the previous global model and used to simulate 500 datasets which replicated 
the designs, subject populations, dose regimens, sample sizes and covariate distributions from Study 
R668-EE-1324 and Study R668-EE-1774. Appropriate statistical intervals (e.g., median, 5th percentile, 
and 95th percentile) of dupilumab concentrations were computed at nominal PK time points in the 
observed and each of the simulated datasets. The observed summary measures were then compared 
to the statistical intervals (e.g., median, 5th and 95th percentiles) of the simulated summary measures 
and plotted in order to provide a visual assessment of the predictive performance of the previous PK 
model in patients with EoE. The data for patients with EoE were combined with data from the previous 
PopPK model (global model) developed using dupilumab data from healthy subjects and patients with 
asthma or AD, and the population PK model was re-analysed with the combined dataset. Parameter 
estimates for the PopPK model with combined data from all 22 studies were compared with those from 
the previous model.

Accounting of Subjects and Samples 
The dataset included a total of 4396 unique subjects, of which 4307 were included in the analysis (251 
patients with EoE, 2015 patients with asthma, 1839 patients with atopic dermatitis, and 202 healthy 
volunteers) and 29515 quantifiable PK samples, of which 29184 were included. A total of 5910 post-
dose PK samples were below the limit of quantification (BLQ; 16.8%), of which 52 (6.9%) were from 
Studies R668-EE-1324 and R668-EE-1774 and the rest were from the 20 studies in healthy subjects 
and patients with asthma or AD. All BLQ samples were excluded from the analysis. Subjects and PK 
samples that were previously excluded in the 20 studies used to develop the global PopPK model were 
also excluded in this analysis, including 11 patients with asthma and 74 patients with AD. There were 
331 quantifiable PK samples in the dataset that were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, in the 
updated PopPK model there were 4 subjects excluded from Study R668-EE-1774 due to all post-dose 
concentrations being BLQ. No quantifiable PK samples were excluded from the EoE population. 
Table 3 Summary of Subjects and PK Samples by Population 
Summaries of Covariates and Baseline Demographics 
In the pooled analysis, most subjects were adults (96.8%) with only the asthma (69 subjects) and EoE 
(68 subjects) patient populations including adolescents. The median (range) age for all populations 
was 42 years (12 to 88 years). Patients with EoE had the lowest median age of 28 years, healthy 
subjects (32 years) and patients with AD (36 years) had similar median ages, and patients with 
asthma had the highest median age of 50 years. The median weights for each of the populations were 
similar with the pooled populations having a median (range) of 76.0 kg (32.0 kg to 185.6 kg). The 
majority (86.1%) of the pooled populations had no treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA 
response to dupilumab, 12.3% had a low ADA titer, 1.2% had a moderate ADA titer, and 0.4% had a 
high ADA titer. Patients with EoE comparatively had less of an immunological response, with 96% 
having no/negative ADA status, 3.2% with a low ADA titer, and 0.8% with a moderate ADA titer. None 
of the EoE patients had a high ADA titer. 
Results 
Exploratory plots comparing dupilumab concentration over time for matched dosing regimens across 
populations (i.e., patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, and EoE) are shown below. The plots 
illustrate the individual observed concentrations and the geometric mean for each population receiving 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W to the end of treatment (week 24 for Part B) and 300 mg QW through week

12 on a semi-log scale. The open circles indicate the observed concentration data, with green 
representing patients with asthma, red, patients with atopic dermatitis and blue, patients with EoE. In 
general, the distributions of the observed concentrations for each of the patient populations are similar 
and the geometric means seem to be overlapping, suggesting that dupilumab PK in patients with EoE 
is similar to other patient populations.

Population PK Model Update 
As the global model was adequate to describe EoE patient data from Studies R668-EE-1324 and R668-
EE-1774, dupilumab concentration data from patients with EoE were combined with the original 
dataset consisting of 20 studies, and parameters were re-estimated in the PopPK global model. With 
the inclusion of the EoE data, a condition number of >180,000 was observed. Therefore, minor 
modifications were implemented to address potential model instability suggested by the high condition 
number.

PK parameter estimates for the original 20 studies (global model) and for the combined 22 studies 
(updated final model) are presented below. The structural parameter estimates for the updated final 
model were within 17% of the previous global model and the confidence intervals (CI) for the two 
models mostly overlapped, suggesting that dupilumab PK is consistent between patients with EoE in 
Studies R668-EE-1324 and R668-EE-1774 and the previously pooled populations (20 studies) which 
included patients with asthma or AD. 
Table 5 Final PopPK Model Comparison 
Model Applications 
•  Comparison of Steady-State Exposure Predictions Across Indications 
Simulations using the updated final model and individual ETAs were performed to generate steady-
state exposure predictions (i.e., Ctrough,ss, Cmax,ss, and AUC2wk,ss). In order to compare exposures 
between different treatment regimens with QW and Q2W dosing intervals, an AUC was computed over 
a 2-week time period at steady-state (AUC2wk,ss) for each population. The AUC2wk,ss exposure 
metric was consistent among patients with EoE, asthma and AD for 300 mg QW and Q2W treatment 
regimens. 
Predicted median Ctrough,ss values for patients with EoE were 73 mg/L (dupilumab 300 mg Q2W) and 
198 mg/L (dupilumab 300 mg QW) which were similar to predicted Ctrough,ss for the other 
populations (mean range for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W is 69 to 73 mg/L; 300 mg QW is 192 to 199 
mg/L).

EoE

The predicted Week 24 concentration-time profiles for patients with EoE are shown below. Note that 
observed data included patients with EoE receiving 12, 24, 28 or 52 weeks of dupilumab treatment; 
therefore, PK profiles are extrapolated for patients with 12 weeks of treatment. Also, in Study R668-
EE-1324, there was a 600 mg loading dose, whereas the simulations were done without a loading dose 
for all patients with EoE.  
PK profiles at the 5th and 95th percentiles suggested an asymmetrical pattern, with a larger separation 
of the 5th percentile from the median. However, mean and median values were nearly equivalent 
which would not support a skewed distribution, although the random effects may not be balanced as 
some patients were noted to have low Ctrough values.

R668-EE-1774 
Post-Hoc Assessment of Covariates 
The updated final model (including 22 studies) was used in a post-hoc covariate analysis to investigate 
if there were any additional covariates of interest, which might impact dupilumab PK in patients with 
EoE. Predicted values of linear CL and Vc were plotted by covariate category or covariate value (for 
continuous covariates). The only covariate that illustrated a trend with linear clearance (CL) and 
volume of the central compartment (Vc) was body size (i.e., body weight, height, and BMI) on linear 
CL and Vc, which is consistent with covariate effects of body weight on linear CL and Vc demonstrated 
in the PopPK model. Height and BMI are correlated with body weight and therefore only body weight 
was tested in the model. There were no major trends in the plots of predicted linear CL and Vc values 
or individual random effect (ETA) values versus other categorical or continuous covariates, including 
markers of EoE disease severity. The results of the post-hoc analysis suggest that there are no 
covariates of interest that are not accounted for in the model, and no further covariates were explored. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In participants with EoE, the PK of dupilumab is characterized by parallel linear and target-mediated 
elimination pathways, with the target-mediated pathway expressing a high degree of non-linearity. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 32/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The observed concentrations over time in the population of participants with EoE are consistent with 
those observed in previously studied patient populations with type 2 disease, such as AD, asthma, and 
CRSwNP.  
Exposure-response relationships for efficacy show that the dupilumab 300 mg QW regimen is 
associated with efficacy in EoE participants with a positive E-R on both histologic and symptomatic 
outcome measures at week 24. In contrast, dose-response and E-R relationships for the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W dosing regimen showed similar differentiation to the dupilumab 300 mg QW regimen on 
the infiltration of eosinophils in the esophagus, but showed a flat E-R that was not differentiated from 
placebo on DSQ total score response. The cause of failure of the 300 mg Q2W regimen to achieve 
efficacy on reducing dysphagia is not likely due to insufficient drug distribution to the esophageal 
mucosa. Results of the phase 3 studies indicate that reducing eosinophilic infiltration to the esophagus 
is necessary but not adequate in improving dysphagia symptoms. Therefore for the treatment of EoE, 
the recommended dose regimen is 300 mg QW. 
The PK and sources of variability in the EoE population are accurately and effectively described by the 
existing integrated global population PK model based on data from patients with AD, asthma, and 
CRSwNP. Body weight remains the single most influential source of variability in exposure for both 
adolescents and adults. 
At the CHMP request, the MAH provided additional data on the PK of adolescents (particularly lighter 
adolescents) compared to adults. While the mean concentrations  are slightly higher in the adolescents 
than in the adults weighing less than 70kg, (likely due to the fact that adolescents are lighter than the 
adults), it is agreed by the CHMP that the observed difference is minimal and results considered as  
overall comparable.  
The MAH also provided further PK data from 31 adolescents dosed with 300mg QW in Part B/C and 
compared their mean dupilumab concentrations with those from adults in the same studies. In 
adolescents initially randomized to receive placebo during Part B followed by dupilumab 300 mg QW 
upon entering Part C (Placebo/Dupilumab 300 mg QW), mean (SD) steady state concentrations of 
dupilumab at Week 52 were 141 ±97.5 mg/L (N=10) compared to 155 ±97.0 mg/L (N=27) in adults, 
which is considered comparable. In adolescent who received dupilumab 300 mg QW throughout the 
entire study period, mean (SD) steady state trough concentrations of dupilumab at Week 52 were 201 
±142 mg/L (N=21) compared to 164 ±108 mg/L in adults (N=45) receiving the same regimen, which 
is a higher concentration than seen in the adults. However, this concentration still lies in the range 
observed in adults patients weighting less than 70kg based on data from 14 studies in various 
indications. In conclusion it is agreed that overall the PK data suggest that adolescents and adults of 
similar weights have similar exposures. 
A population modelling analysis was performed to characterize the PK of dupilumab in patients with 
EoE, including data from the Phase 2 study (Study R668-EE-1324) in adults with EoE and the Phase 3 
Study (R668-EE-1774) in adult (≥18 years old) and adolescent EoE patients (≥12 to <18 years old).  
The global population PK (PopPK) model which was previously developed from a large dataset in three 
different populations, was intended to serve as a robust starting point for PopPK analyses of dupilumab 
in other Th2- mediated inflammatory diseases, such as EoE. In the current analysis, an external visual 
predictive check (VPC) was performed to assess whether dupilumab PK is consistent between patients 
with EoE and other populations. Dupilumab PK data from patients with EoE was subsequently 
combined with PK data from previous dupilumab studies in healthy subjects and patients with AD or 
asthma, and the previous population PK model was re-fit to the combined data-set including patents 
with EoE. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 33/179 
 
 
 
 
The external validation analysis demonstrated that dupilumab PK in patients with EoE is consistent 
with AD and asthma patient populations. Dupilumab PK was described by a 2-compartment disposition 
model with first order SC absorption, parallel linear and non-linear elimination and body weight-
dependent elimination and distribution volume. The re-estimated final model, which included pooled 
data from 22 studies including patients with EoE, resulted in similar primary dupilumab PK parameter 
estimates as the previous final model without EoE data. 
The integrated final model (including all 22 studies) predicted steady-state exposures that were 
comparable for all indications, including EoE, AD and asthma, suggesting no differences in dupilumab 
PK across the studied populations. 
Post-hoc covariate analysis identified no new covariates that might impact dupilumab PK in patients 
with EoE, in addition to the existing effects of body weight on linear CL and Vc in the updated global 
PopPK model. No further covariates were explored in this analysis. 
Consistent with the incidence of ADA, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in the population of 
participants with EoE was low and consistent between Study R668-EE-1324 and R668-EE-1774 with an 
incidence of 1.3% and 2.6%, respectively. In participants who received dupilumab 300 mg QW or Q2W 
for 24 weeks in Part B of Study R668-EE-1774 of 1.3% and 0.7% in all participants who received 300 
mg QW in EoE Studies R668-EE-1324 and R668-EE-1774 (Parts A and B). Most participants who 
developed treatment-emergent ADA exhibited a low titer and transient response. 
The additional data from Part B/C and the pooled analysis of data for participants with AD and EoE 
receiving 300 mg QW dupilumab are consistent with the data presented, that after accounting for body 
weight, age is not a clinically meaningful covariate of dupilumab PK. Furthermore, the results indicate 
that it does not have an impact on safety, as presented later in the Clinical Safety section. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data evaluated for the population of participants with EoE are 
consistent with those observed in previously studied patient populations with type 2 disease. The data 
support the use of dupilumab 300 mg QW for the treatment of patients with EoE weighing at least 40 
kg. The following dose recommendation for EoE patients is therefore added in section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
The recommended dose of dupilumab for patients 12 years of age and older is 300 mg given every 
week (QW).

Study R668-EE-1774 A Phase 3, Randomized, 3-Part Study to Investigate 
the Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in Adult and Adolescent Patients with 
Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) 
Methods 
Study Design 
Study R668-EE-1774 was a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, pivotal phase 3 study to 
evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab treatment compared with placebo in adult and adolescent patients 
with EoE. This study consisted of 3 parts. Part A and Part B consisted of a 24-week double-blind 
treatment period each, Part C of a 28-week extended active treatment period. A 12-week post 
treatment follow-up period followed at the end of Part C or at the end of Parts A or B of the for 
participants who did not enter Part C. Data for participants from Part A who entered Part C are 
presented in this application. Part C for participants from Part B was still ongoing at the time of 
submission, additional results from part B/C were submitted at CHMP’s request and are presented 
below. Of note, participants who participated in Part A were not eligible to participate in Part B. 
Figure 7 Study Flow Diagram 
After a screening period (up to 12 weeks), participants in Part A were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
dupilumab 300 mg QW or placebo administered SC. In Part B, participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to dupilumab 300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, or placebo administered SC.  
Randomization of participants was stratified by age (≥18 vs ≥12 to <18 years of age) and use of PPI 
at randomization . 
If medically necessary, rescue medications (systemic and/or swallowed topical corticosteroids) or 
emergency esophageal dilation were allowed. An endoscopy with biopsies was to be performed prior to 
the initiation of rescue therapy unless COVID-19 restrictions prohibited this procedure. If the 
endoscopy with biopsies could not occur due to COVID-19 restrictions, rescue treatment was not to be 
delayed and these participants were eligible for Part C. Part C treatment was to be initiated per the 
schedule of events and only at an in-clinic visit. Participants receiving rescue therapy were able to 
continue to receive study drug. They remained blinded and returned to all remaining study treatment 
visits and participated in all study assessments. However, they did not undergo any scheduled 
endoscopy/biopsies subsequent to the date of rescue. Participants on a food-elimination diet must 
remain on the same diet throughout the study.

At the end of the 24-week double-blind treatment period, eligible participants in Part A and Part B had 
the option to enter Part C a 28-week extended active treatment period where all participants from Part 
A received dupilumab 300 mg QW.

Study participants 
Part A 
In Part A, 81 participants met the eligibility criteria and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. 39 participants 
were in the placebo group and 42 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
The study population in Part A consisted of adult males and females ≥18 years of age and adolescent 
males and females ≥12 to <18 years of age at the time of study entry with EoE. Approximately 25% of 
participants enrolled in Part A were to be adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age. Study participants 
were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of EoE that was not responsive to high-dose proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Participants who were receiving PPIs during the screening period and eligible to 
enrol in the study were to continue a high-dose PPI regimen during the study. All participants were 
required to have an endoscopy with biopsies at the baseline visit (visit 2) which demonstrated ≥15 
intraepithelial eos/hpf in at least 2 of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, mid, and distal). 
The clinical study report describes the results of the primary analysis with a data cut-off date of 08 
May 2020. The addendum to the Part A Clinical study report (CSR) describes data from 4 participants 
who had not completed their Part A week 24 biopsy at the time of the data cut-off, due to not being 
able to attend study visits because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Part B 
In Part B, 240 participants were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment regimens: 80 in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW group, 81 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 79 in the placebo group.  
The study population consisted of adult males and females ≥18 years of age and adolescent males and 
females ≥12 to <18 years of age at the time of study entry with EoE. At least 10% of participants 
enrolled in Part B were to be adolescents ≥12 to <18 years of age. At least 30% of participants 
enrolled in Part B must have had a history of prior use of Swallowed Topical Steroids (STCs) for the 
treatment of EoE. Study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of EoE that was not 
responsive to high-dose PPI therapy. Participants who were receiving PPIs during the screening period 
and eligible to enrol in the study were to continue a high-dose PPI regimen during the study. 
Participants were also required to have a history of an average of at least 2 episodes of dysphagia per 
week in the 4 weeks prior to screening and at least 4 episodes of dysphagia in the 2 weeks prior to 
baseline. Participants must also have completed at least 11 of 14 days of the DSQ e-diary data entry in 
the 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit (visit 3) and have a baseline DSQ score ≥10. 
The efficacy and safety primary analysis data evaluated for this submission with a database lock date 
of 30 Sep 2021 are considered final for Part B.  
Part C 
At the end of the double-blind treatment period (week 24), eligible participants in Part A and Part B 
had the option to enter a 28-week extended active treatment period (Part C) where all participants 
received dupilumab.  
• 
Participants from Part A 
The study population of Part C (participants who entered from Part A) consisted of adult males and 
females ≥18 years of age and adolescent males and females ≥12 to <18 years of age with EoE at the 
time of study entry into Part A. Participants who developed a serious or drug related adverse event 
during Parts A or B, which in the opinion of the investigator could indicate that continued treatment 
may have presented an unreasonable risk for the participant, poor compliance or inability to complete 
required study assessments, became pregnant, prematurely discontinued from study, did not undergo

endoscopy with biopsies prior to receiving rescue treatment or systemic hypersensitivity to dupilumab 
or the excipients were excluded. 
All 77 participants who continued into Part C of the study were treated with SC dupilumab 300 mg QW, 
regardless of randomized treatment received in Part A. All 77 participants received at least 1 dose of 
dupilumab 300 mg QW during Part C (37 placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and 40 dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW) and are included in the Part C SAF. 
The completed R668-EE-1774 Part A-C clinical study report contained the analysis of data from the 28-
week extended active treatment phase enrolling patients from Part A. The report contained all data 
through 18 Nov 2020 (data cut-off). The database lock occurred on 17 Dec 2020. 
At the time of data cut-off, 66 of 77 participants (85.7%) completed week 52 (end of Part C; week 52 
visit), 5 of 77 participants (6.5%) discontinued Part C and 6/77 participants (7.8%) were continuing in 
Part C (including 1 participant who completed the 28 weeks of study drug in Part C but had not 
completed the final visit in Part C). 
An addendum was submitted summarizing the data from the 6 ongoing participants in Part C obtained 
after the data cut-off. Individual patient data profiles are provided that include all data from 18 Nov 
2020 up to last patient last visit (LPLV) (27 May 2021).  
• 
Participants from Part B 
With the responses to the Request for Supplementary Information, the MAH submitted the data from 
study Part B/C as requested by CHMP. These additional data include 24 adolescents who completed 52 
weeks on dupilumab 300 mg QW, which is the planned dose for registration for this indication. 
Of the 240 participants randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg every 2 
weeks (Q2W) or placebo in Part B, 227 entered Part C. Participants, who received placebo during the 
double-blind treatment period of Part B were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dupilumab 300 mg QW or 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. All other Part B participants remained on the same dupilumab dose regimen 
upon entering Part C. Of the 227 participants, 111 participants received dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part 
C (37 received placebo and 74 received dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part B), and 116 participants 
received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in Part C (37 received placebo and 79 received dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W in Part B). Of the 79 adolescent participants enrolled in Part B (approximately 33% of the study 
population in Part B), 75 adolescents entered Part C (26/27 from the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 
24/26 from the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 25/26 from the Part B placebo group). Four Part B 
patients discontinued study and did not participate in Part C.

Sample size 
Part A: 81 patients (61 were adults and 20 were paediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age) 
The planned sample size for Part A was approximately 40 patients in each treatment group such that 
for the comparison of each dupilumab dose regimen to placebo: 
• 
This sample size will yield >99% power to detect a treatment difference of 62% in the 
proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf 
at week 24 (placebo 3% vs. dupilumab 65%) at a 2-sided significance level of 5% using 
Fisher’s exact test. 
•  With respect to the treatment group difference in the mean change from baseline in DSQ total 
score, assuming a common SD of 13.0, this sample size is expected to generate a 95% 
confidence interval whose half-width is 5.7. If the true treatment difference is -9.0 points, the 
statistical power for the co-primary endpoint of DSQ will be 80% using a two-sample t-test. 
Part B: 240 patients (161 were adults and 79 were paediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age) 
Based on the Part A study results, the planned sample size for Part B was approximately 70 patients in 
each treatment group such that for the comparison of each dupilumab dose regimen to placebo: 
• 
This sample size will yield >99.9% power to detect a treatment difference of 55.4% in the 
proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf 
at week 24 between placebo (5.1%) and each dupilumab treatment group (59.5%) at a 2-
sided significance level of 5% using Fisher’s exact test. 
• 
This sample size will provide >99.9% power to detect a treatment difference of -12.3 points in 
the mean change from baseline in the total DSQ score to week 24 at a 2-sided significance 
level of 5% using a two-sample t-test, assuming a common SD of 15.0. 
Randomisation 
Part A: randomised 1:1 to receive either 300 mg dupilumab every week (N=42) or placebo (N=39), 
stratified by age (≥18 vs. ≥12 to <18 years of age) and use of PPI at randomization (yes vs. no). 
Part B: randomised 1:1:1 to receive either 300 mg dupilumab every week (N=80), 300 mg dupilumab 
every other week (N=81; the 300 mg every other week dosage regimen is not approved for EoE) or 
placebo (N=79) stratified by age (≥18 vs ≥12 to <18 years of age) and use of PPI at randomization 
(yes vs. no). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 41/179 
 
 
 
 
 
Part C, all patients who previously participated in Part A received 300 mg ’TM’ (N=77) every week. Of 
the patients who previously participated in Part B, those who received ‘TM’ in Part B continued their 
dosing regimen in Part C and those who received placebo were randomised to either dosing regimen. 
Blinding (masking) 
Double-blind study (both parts A and B) until week 24 (co-primary endpoint). 
Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) population that includes all randomised patients was utilised in the 
evaluation of efficacy in study R668 EE 1774. The study-part specific per protocol set (PPS) includes all 
patients in the corresponding FAS except for those who are excluded due to important protocol 
violations. For Part A and Part B, the study part-specific safety analysis set (SAF) includes all 
randomized patients who received any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treated). 
Analysis of the co-primary efficacy endpoints: 
Histologic response (binary endpoint): 
The proportion of patients achieving a histologic response of peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil 
count (from all 3 regions) of ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test to assess the difference in the proportion of responders in the FAS adjusting for the 
randomization stratification factors (age group [≥18 vs. ≥12 to <18 years of age] and use of PPI at 
randomization [yes vs. no]). 
DSQ total score (continuous endpoint):  
The absolute change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 was analysed using an analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model for the FAS with treatment group, randomization stratification factor, 
and baseline endpoint measurement as covariates included in the model. 
Missing values, sensitivity analyses: 
Data may have been collected after the participant discontinued treatment and was included in the 
analyses. Participants were considered as non-responders after rescue treatment. Multiple imputation 
(MI) was used if participants had dosing interruption due to COVID-19. Participants with missing peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 24 were considered as non-responders if 
missingness was not due to COVID-19 and were imputed by MI if missingness was due to COVID-19. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed using different imputation methods for the peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 and for the absolute change in DSQ total score 
from baseline to week 24. 
Multiplicity (Hierarchical Testing): 
Statistical significance of both co-primary efficacy endpoints was required before drawing inferential 
conclusions about any secondary efficacy endpoints. If both co-primary endpoints were statistically 
significant, the testing was to proceed to the key and other secondary efficacy endpoints following a 
hierarchical procedure.

Table 7 Statistical hierarchy for co-primary and secondary endpoints for R668-EE-1774 Part A and 
Part B 
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in Part A and Part B 
Binary endpoints: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints that measure binary responses at week 24 were analysed in the same 
fashion as the co-primary endpoint of histologic response of peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil 
count of ≤6 eos/hpf, including the method to handle missing data and planned sensitivity analyses. 
Continuous endpoints: 
During an endoscopy procedure, EoE-EREFS was completed by the investigator for Parts A and B. In 
addition to the investigator reading, video imaging was to be collected during Part B for EoE‑EREFS 
analysis and scoring by a centralized reading center. However, during the course of the study, it was 
noted that there were technical and image quality issues associated with the central reading of EoE-
EREFS. Per the Part B SAP, given centralized readings were introduced for the first time for Part B 
participants of this study, if the centralized reading was not possible for a given proportion of the FAS 
(e.g., >20% patients in FAS with either baseline or week 24 unavailable), the EoE-EREFS performed in 
Part B would be based on the investigator reading, as was consistent with Part A. 
No interim analysis was planned according to the protocol and no interim analysis was performed 
accordingly.

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which lead to numerous protocol deviations. 
➢  Amendments 
Five protocol amendments were implemented for study R668-EE-1774. All changes in the conduct of 
the study were implemented by protocol amendments. 
The main purpose of Amendment 1 was to revise several exclusion criteria. 
The main purpose of Amendment 2 was to add additional secondary endpoints for proportion of 
patients who receive rescue medications or procedures, revision of several sections related to patient 
screening and eligibility criteria, change design of Part C as per Health Authority request. 
The main purpose of Amendment 3 was to add transcriptome sequencing for analysing RNA 
expression of eosinophilic EoE and type 2 inflammation to the study secondary objectives and 
endpoints, to add the EQ-5D-3L Questionnaire, to revise the EoE-EREFS procedure for Part B patients 
to allow for centralized reading and scoring. 
The main purpose of protocol Amendment 4 was to protect participant safety and data integrity 
during the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing for certain study procedures to occur at delayed time 
points and/or outside of the clinic environment. All temporary mechanisms utilized, deviations from 
planned study procedures were documented and remained in effect only for the duration of the public 
health emergency. At the time of protocol Amendment 4, Part A of the study was fully enrolled and 
mostly complete. 
Most important deviations implemented on Study R668-EE-1774 due to the impacts of COVID-19 
were: 
• 
to allow shipments of IP direct to the participant. This process was implemented on 01 April 
2020. 
• 
To extend Part A IP dosing was for 4 participants (1 placebo and 3 dupilumab 300 mg QW) 
who could not make their visit 11 appointment. The endoscopy that is performed during visit 
11 is one of the co-primary endpoints for Part A the study and must be done before active drug 
(dupilumab) is given at visit 11 (Part C of the study). Visit 11 is end of treatment period for 
Part A and the start of the extended treatment period in Part C. It was decided to extend 
blinded Part A dosing until week 24 endoscopy visits could be performed for these participants. 
Thus, these 4 participants were to continue Part A treatment after the 24-week treatment 
period and entry into Part C was delayed. Three of these 4 participants took extended doses up 
to 08 May 2020. 
• 
To allow Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) questionnaires to be completed via interviews over 
the phone during a call between the study participants and relevant site personnel (not for Part 
A).  
• 
To allow for remote site qualification, the conduct of a comprehensive remote Site Initiation 
Visit (via telephone/Skype), the remote review of data (in countries where this practice is 
permissible), remote routine monitoring visits to support protocol delivery and compliance (not 
for Part A).

EMA/6467/2023  
Page 47/179 
 
 
 
 
 
The main purpose of Amendment 5 was to adjust the sample size for Part B based on the results of 
Part A of the study and to add an additional database lock after all patients in Part A complete study 
week 52 of Part C. 
➢  Protocol deviations 
Part A 
A total of 428 protocol deviations were reported for 68 (84.0%) participants during Part A. Of these, 
101 protocol deviations in 47 (58.0%) participants were considered important protocol deviations.  
As most participants had already completed Part A of the study, very few participants (n=2) had 
protocol deviations related to COVID-19. No participants had important protocol deviations related to 
COVID-19. 
The proportion of participants with important protocol deviations was similar in both treatment groups 
with 211 in the placebo and 217 in the dupilumab 330 mg QW group. Ten participants (5 in the 
placebo group and 5 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group) were excluded from the PPS due to specified 
important protocol deviations during Part A.  
Part B 
During Part B, 2483 protocol deviations were reported from 225/240 participants (93.8%). Participants 
may have had more than 1 protocol deviation. Of these 2483 deviations, 430 (17.3%) were reported 
as important protocol deviations from 153/240 participants (63.8%). The most frequently reported 
important protocol deviation overall was in the category of procedure not performed (50.4%), which 
was reported for 49.4% to 51.9% of participants across treatment groups. Important protocol 
deviations related to procedure not performed included DSQ assessment missed >6 times in a 14-day 
period, urine or serum pregnancy test(s) not performed, baseline PGIS assessment not collected, EoE-
EREFS not performed or incomplete, baseline physical examination not done, and esophageal biopsy 
collection not performed or insufficient samples collected. 
The most frequently reported procedure not performed was DSQ e-diary not completed by participants 
>6 times in a 14-day period after the baseline visit, which was reported for 38.8% to 45.7% of 
participants across treatment groups. This protocol deviation was further evaluated to determine any 
impact on the DSQ primary endpoint. A minimum of 8 diary entries was required for each 14-day 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

period to derive a standardized DSQ total score for the analysis. Across each 14-day block at baseline 
and at week 24, most participants had 8 days or more of DSQ e-diary entries completed (only 0.4% at 
baseline and 16.3% at week 24 were missing due to <8 days of DSQ completion).  
For participants who had <8 days of DSQ completion at week 24, the primary analysis considered 
these data missing and results were imputed (multiple imputations [MI]). Further, sensitivity analyses 
regardless of the assumptions used for missing data and supplemental analysis including averaging the 
DSQ total score over 7 days instead of over 14 days were performed using different DSQ scoring 
algorithms to assess the robustness of the primary analysis. The results of these analysis were 
consistent with the primary analysis. This supports the conclusion that this deviation did not impact the 
efficacy results of the study. The next most frequently reported important protocol deviation 
categorized as procedure not performed was urine pregnancy testing not performed at 1 or more 
specified visits (10.0%), which was reported for 13.8% of the participants in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group, 7.4% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 7/79 participants 8.9% in the placebo 
group. No pregnancies were reported during this study. 
Part C 
A total of 892 protocol deviations were reported for 74 participants (96.1%) during Part C and the 12-
week follow-up period. Of these, 109 protocol deviations reported in 59 participants were considered 
important protocol deviations.  
Important protocol deviations during Part C included procedures not performed (i.e., missing DSQ 
assessments, urine pregnancy test not performed, EoE-EREFS not performed, esophageal biopsy 
collection not performed), wrong treatment or incorrect dose received by 6 participants, prohibited 
treatment received by 5 participants or other treatment compliance in 3 participants. 
Thirty-two participants (41.6%) had at least 1 visit impacted by COVID-19. These included primarily 
missed study visits, remote study visits, or hybrid study visits due to travel restrictions, site closures, 
limited site personnel, and participant/guardian under quarantine. A total of 493 protocol deviations 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported for 51 participants (66.2%) during Part C. 
Baseline data 
Part A 
Demographic characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The majority of 
participants were male (60.5%) and most participants were white (96.3%) and not Hispanic or Latino 
(93.8%). The mean age of participants was 31.5 (14.31) years with 24.7% of participants ≥12 to <18 
years of age, 43.2% of participants ≥18 to <40 years of age, and 32.1% of participants ≥40 to <65 
years. No enrolled participants were ≥65 years of age. The mean (SD) weight of participants was 77.8 
(20.95) kg. Most participants (96.3%) were from the United States, with 3.7% from Spain. The 
placebo group had a higher percentage of female participants than the dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
(46.2% vs 33.3%, respectively), more participants ≥18 to <40 years of age (56.4% vs 31.0%, 
respectively), and fewer participants ≥40 to <65 years of age (20.5% vs 42.9%, respectively). 
Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups and indicated 
a highly symptomatic population, with most participants having previously used swallowed topical 
corticosteroids for the treatment of EoE (74.1%) and almost half of participants having prior 
esophageal dilations (43.2%). 
Thirty-seven percent of participants had a history of both swallowed topical corticosteroid use for the 
treatment of EoE and prior esophageal dilations. Overall, 56.8% of participants had been on a food

elimination diet in the past. The mean peak eosinophil count of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, mid, 
and distal) at baseline was 89.3 (48.29) eos/hpf. The mean EREFS total score (including stricture – 
proximal + distal regions) at baseline was 6.3 (2.83) points. The mean DSQ score at baseline was 33.6 
(12.41), indicating multiple days of dysphagia every 2 weeks (14 days). The mean number of days 
with dysphagia at baseline was 10.0 (3.19) days out of 14 days, with more than half of participants 
(49/81, 60.5%) having dysphagia for ≥10 out of 14 days. More than 70% of participants had a 
baseline blood peripheral eos count ≥0.30 giga/L (58/81, 71.6%). A number of participants had other 
type 2 co-morbidities, including atopic dermatitis (19.8%), asthma (35.8%), and allergic rhinitis 
(60.5%). 
Participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group had numerically lower peak and mean esophageal 
eosinophil counts from the 3 esophageal regions (82.6 eos/hpf and 58.71 eos/hpf, respectively) at 
baseline than the placebo group (96.5 eos/hpf and 70.30 eos/hpf, respectively). Although the mean 
total IgE was higher in the placebo group than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the median IgE 
levels were similar. The mean total IgE values differed due to participant in the placebo group with a 
very high IgE value (19993 IU/mL). 
The majority of participants (85.2%) had at least 1 atopic/allergic condition other than EoE. The most 
frequently reported allergic condition was allergic rhinitis (59.3%).  
Seventy-eight of the 81 participants in Part A used at least 1 prior medication (other than PPIs used to 
treat EoE). The most frequently reported ATC Therapeutic Classes of prior medications were 
Anesthetics (75.3%), Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases (55.6%), Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Anti-
inflammatory / Anti-infective Agents (48.1%) and Antihistamines for Systemic Use (46.9%).  
Prior procedures were reported for 80 participants (98.8%; 39 [100%] in the placebo group and 41 
[97.6%] in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group). The most frequently reported procedure aside from 
endoscopies and esophagogastroduodenoscopies, required for the diagnosis and monitoring of the 
underlying condition, was the esophageal dilation procedure (42.0%). 
There was some variability in the use of concomitant medications (other than PPI) during the study. 
However, the use was generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups. 
Seventy-six participants (38 in the placebo group and 38 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group) in Part 
A reported using at least 1 concomitant medication (other than PPI for EoE) during the study. The 
most frequently reported medications were Anesthetics (23 in the placebo group and 21 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group), Antihistamines for systemic use (20 in the placebo group and 19 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group), Antiemetics and Antinauseants (11 in the placebo group and 7 in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group).

Table 8 Concomitant medications (other than PPIs for EoE) taken by more than 20% of participants 
in either treatment group during Part A 24-week treatment period (Part A SAF) 
During the Part A 24-week treatment period, 4 participants on placebo (10.3%) received rescue 
medication with glucocorticoids (3 with swallowed topical corticosteroids and 1 with systemic 
corticosteroids) and 1 participant on placebo (2.6%) underwent a esophageal dilation procedure.  
No participants in the dupilumab group received rescue medication or underwent a rescue procedure. 
Overall, 7 participants (3 placebo participants, 7.7%, and 4 dupilumab participants, 9.5%) in the Part 
A SAF population used a prohibited medication during the 24-week treatment period. Prohibited 
medications used were glucocorticoids, corticosteroids acting locally, systemic glucocorticoids, PPI 
(administered for nausea) and corticosteroids. Two participants had prohibited initiation, 
discontinuation, or change of PPI use for EoE. Of the participants who used a prohibited medication 
during the Part A, 4 participants (2 in the placebo and 2 in the dupilumab group) were excluded from 
the PPS for receiving a prohibited medication considered a specified important protocol deviation. 
Overall, 33 participants (16 placebo participants and 17 dupilumab participants) in Part A had at least 
1 food eliminated in their diet at baseline for either allergies or EoE. Food elimination diets were being 
utilized by 8.6% of participants for EoE at baseline compared with 34.6% of participants for allergies. 
Adolescent (≥12 to <18 years) Participants for Part A 
A total of 20 participants were ≥12 and <18 years of age. The mean age of the adolescent subgroup 
was 14.9 years. The majority (80.0%) were male and most participants were white (90.0%). The 
mean weight and BMI of adolescent participants was 58.9 kg and 20.8 kg/m2, respectively with 35.0% 
≥60 kg. All adolescent participants (100.0%) were from the US.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The majority 
of adolescent participants having previously used STCs for the treatment of EoE (85.0%) and 10.0% 
having prior esophageal dilations with a mean of 2.5 previous dilations. Over half (55.0%) of 
adolescent participants were receiving PPIs at the time of randomization. Overall, 85.0% adolescent 
participants had been on a food elimination diet in the past and 75.0% were on a food elimination diet 
at screening.  
The mean peak eosinophil count of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, mid, and distal) at baseline was 
50.18 eos/hpf. The mean EREFS total score at baseline was 3.5 points. The mean DSQ score at 
baseline was 36.8, indicating substantial symptom burden of dysphagia in the preceding 2 weeks (14 
days). 
Part B 
Demographic characteristics of participants included in the Part B FAS were generally balanced across 
the 3 treatment groups. 
The majority of participants were male (63.8%) and most participants were White (90.4%) and not 
Hispanic or Latino (94.2%). The mean age of participants was 28.1 years with 32.9% of participants 
≥12 to <18 years of age, 46.3% of participants ≥18 to <40 years of age, and 20.0% of participants 
≥40 to <65 years. Two participants (0.8%) were ≥65 years of age. The mean weight of participants 
was 76.2 kg with 77.1% of participants ≥60 kg. Most participants (80.8%) were from the US followed 
by Australia (4.2%), Canada (3.8%), Italy (2.9%), and Spain (2.5%). The placebo group had a higher 
percentage of male participants (73.4%) than in either of the dupilumab 300 mg groups (QW: 62.5%; 
Q2W: 55.6%) and a smaller percentage (15.2%) of participants <60 kg (dupilumab 300 mg QW: 
26.3%; dupilumab 300 mg Q2W: 27.2%). 
Baseline disease characteristics 
The baseline disease characteristics indicated a highly symptomatic population, with the majority of 
participants having previously used STCs for the treatment of EoE (73.3%) and 35.4% having prior 
esophageal dilations with a mean of 2.3 previous dilations. Overall, 29.2% had a history of both STC 
used for EoE and prior esophageal dilation. Only 30.0% reported STCs as being effective for EoE. A 
total of 49.2% had a history of an inadequate response, intolerance, and /or contraindication to STCs. 
Almost three-fourths of participants were receiving PPIs at the time of randomization. Overall, 59.6% 
had been on a food elimination diet in the past and 37.1% were on a food elimination diet at 
screening. The mean peak eosinophil count of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, mid, and distal) at 
baseline was 87.1 eos/hpf. The mean EREFS total score at baseline was 7.2 points. The mean DSQ 
score at baseline was 36.7, indicating substantial symptom burden of dysphagia. The mean number of 
days with dysphagia at baseline was 10.7 days out of 14 days with 71.25% having dysphagia for ≥10 
out of 14 days. Several participants had other type 2 co-morbidities, including atopic dermatitis 
(25.8%), asthma (44.6%) and allergic rhinitis (63.8%). Overall, 90.0% had a history of at least 1 
atopic/allergic condition other than EoE, including 89.1% with a current history.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications (Other Than PPI for EoE)/Procedures 
A total of 98.7% in the Part B used at least 1 prior medication with 97.5% in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group, all participants in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 98.7% in the placebo group. The 
most frequently reported ATC Therapeutic Classes of prior medications were Anesthetics (67.8%), 
Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases (57.3%), Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Anti-inflammatory/ Anti-
infective Agents (53.6%) and Antihistamines for Systemic Use (46.4%). Prior procedures were 
reported for 96.2% of the participants with 93.8% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 96.3% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 98.7% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported

procedure aside from esophagogastroduodenoscopies (37.7%) and endoscopies (27.2%) required for 
the diagnosis and monitoring of the underlying condition, was the esophageal dilation procedure 
(35.6%). 
Concomitant Medications (Other Than PPI for EoE)/Procedures 
Two hundred thirty-two of the 239 participants in the Part B SAF reported using at least 1 concomitant 
medication during the study: 97.5% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 97.5% in the dupilumab 300 
mg Q2W group, and 96.2% in the placebo group. 
During the Part B 24-week treatment period, 5 participants in the Part B received rescue treatment.  
One participant in the placebo group (1.3%) received concomitant medications in both the 
Corticosteroids for Systemic Use (prednisone) and Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Anti-inflammatory/Anti-
infective Agents (budesonide) therapeutic classes as rescue medication.  
One participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (1.3%) received concomitant medications in both 
the Corticosteroids for Systemic Use (prednisolone sodium phosphate) and Drugs for Obstructive 
Airway Disease (fluticasone propionate) therapeutic classes as rescue medication and to treat a TEAE 
of abdominal pain.  
Three participants (1 in each treatment group) underwent a rescue procedure during the Part B 
treatment period. Rescue procedures included esophageal dilation procedure in 2 participants (1 in the 
placebo group and 1 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group) and pylorus dilation procedure in 1 
participant (in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group). 
All participants in the Part B received at least 1 prior high dose PPI for EoE either prior to screening or 
during the screening period per protocol.  
73.2% in the Part B used at least 1 prior swallowed topical/systemic corticosteroid for EoE, including 
68.8% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 80.2% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 70.5% in 
the placebo group. Most participants (73.2%) used prior STCs, while only 3.3% used prior systemic 
corticosteroids. Treatment with STCs was deemed not effective in 43.1%, with 59.8% reporting 
recurrence of EoE symptoms within 3 months. 
During the Part B 24-week treatment period 72.4% used at least 1 concomitant PPI for EoE, including 
72.5% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 70.4% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 74.4% in 
the placebo group. The most frequently used PPI overall was omeprazole followed by pantoprazole. 
8.4% of the participants in the Part B used a prohibited medication during the 24-week treatment 
period: 10,3% of the placebo participants, 8.8% of dupilumab 300 mg QW participants and 6,2% of 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W participants. The most frequently used prohibited medications overall 
were Corticosteroids for Systemic Use. All systemic corticosteroids were given ≥10 days prior to the 
week 24 biopsy. 
Adolescent Participants in Part B 
The majority of adolescent participants were male (72.2%) and most were White (81.0%) and not 
Hispanic or Latino (96.2%). The mean age of adolescent participants was 15.0 years. The mean weight 
of adolescent participants was 64.3 kg with 53.2% ≥60 kg. Most adolescent participants (89.9%) were 
from the US followed by Canada (7.6%), Australia (1.3%), and Spain (1.3%). 
The majority of adolescent participants having previously used STCs for the treatment of EoE (72.2%) 
and 6.3% having prior esophageal dilations with a mean of 2.8 previous dilations. A history of both 
STCs used for the treatment of EoE and prior esophageal dilation was reported for 6.3% of the 
adolescent participants. Only 25.3% reported STCs as being effective for EoE. About half of adolescent

participants (51.9%) had a history of an inadequate response, intolerance, and /or contraindication to 
prior STCs. Almost 70% of adolescent participants were receiving PPIs at the time of randomization. 
Overall, 52/79 adolescent participants (65.8%) had been on a food elimination diet in the past. Forty-
three of 79 adolescent participants (54.4%) were on a food elimination diet at screening, including 
21/79 adolescent participants (26.6%) for EoE. 
Part C 
• 
Participants from Part A 
At the start of Part C, demographic characteristics for participants from Part A who enrolled in Part C 
were consistent with that for participants from the Part A FAS. The majority of participants were male 
(61.0%) and most participants were white (96.1%) and not Hispanic or Latino (93.5%).  The mean 
age of participants at study entry was 31.8 years with 24.1% of participants ≥12 to <18 years of age, 
41.6% of participants ≥18 to <40 years of age, and 33.8% of participants ≥40 to <65 years of age.  
No participants in Part C were ≥65 years of age. Most participants were from the United States 
(96.1%), with 3.9% from Spain. Demographic characteristics for participants from Part A who enrolled 
in Part C were consistent with that for participants from the Part A FAS. 
At the start of Part C, the mean peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 3 esophageal 
regions was 66.7 eos/hpf in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 12.3 eos/hpf in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/ dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
A total of 98.7% in the Part C (Participants from Part A) used at least 1 medication prior to Part C of 
the study (other than PPIs for EoE). The most frequently reported ATC Therapeutic Classes of prior 
medications were Anesthetics (80.5%), Antihistamines for Systemic Use (57.1%), Drugs for 
Obstructive Airway Disease (57.1%), Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Anti-inflammatory / Anti-infective 
Agents (55.8%), and Blood Substitutes and Perfusion Solutions (44.2%). The most frequently reported

procedure (42.9%), which was done for treatment of EoE. 
• 
Participants from Part B 
At the start of Part C, demographic characteristics for participants from Part B who enrolled in Part C 
were consistent with that for participants from the Part B FAS. 
The majority of participants were male (63.9%) and most participants were White (90.7%) and not

Numbers analysed 
Part A 
All 81 participants were treated as randomized and, therefore, included in both the Part A FAS and Part 
A SAF. Analyses on the Part A FAS are considered to be the primary analyses for efficacy. The Part A 
SAF is the basis for Part A safety analyses. 10 participants (5 in each treatment group) were excluded 
from the Part A PPS due to important protocol violations.

•  Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil 
Count ≤6 eos/hpf at Week 24 
Participants must have had a peak intraepithelial eosinophil count ≥15 eos/hpf in at least 2 of the 3 
esophageal regions sampled to be eligible for the study. The proportion of participants who achieved 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 (which indicates reduced 
esophageal inflammation) was significantly greater (p<0.0001) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
(25/42 [59.5%] participants) versus the placebo group (2/39 [5.1%] participants). Mean (SD) peak 
eosinophil count of 3 regions at baseline was 89.3 (48.29)/hpf and ranged from 16 to 228/hpf.

eos/hpf in All 3 Regions at Week 24 (Part A FAS) 
Sensitivity analyses, using different imputation methods, yielded the same results as the primary 
analysis and confirmed that, regardless of the assumptions used for missing data, treatment with 
dupilumab produced a greater clinical effect size in comparison with placebo. These sensitivity analyses 
include: 
• 
Last observation carried forward (LOCF)-MI: data were set to missing post rescue. Participants 
missing endoscopy with biopsies at week 24 were imputed by MI if due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Otherwise missing values were imputed by LOCF if missingness was not due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic closures. 
•  All observed values, regardless of rescue treatment use, were included in the analysis. 
Participants with missing data were considered as non-responder, regardless of whether 
missingness was due to the COVID-19 pandemic closures or not. 
•  Data were set to missing post rescue. Participants with missing data were considered as non-
responders, regardless of whether missingness was due to the COVID-19 pandemic closures or 
not. 
Subgroup Analysis 
Descriptive analyses were performed on the primary endpoint results to summarize the treatment 
effects across the subgroups of age (≥12 to <18 years or ≥18 years), sex, baseline body weight (<60 
kg or ≥60 kg), BMI (<25 kg/m2 or ≥25-<30 kg/m2), and baseline disease characteristics, history of 
prior swallowed topical steroid use for EoE, treatment with PPI at randomization per IWRS or per EDS, 
history of esophageal dilations and food elimination.

A trend of dupilumab treatment benefit versus placebo was observed in all the subgroups analysed, 
and logistic regression modelling did not demonstrate any nominally statistically significant p-values 
for the treatment by subgroup interactions that were evaluated. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ Total Score 
Treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW resulted in improvement in DSQ total score compared to 
placebo at week 24 in participants with EoE. The least squares (LS) mean change (reduction [i.e., 
improvement]) from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 was significantly greater (p=0.0004) in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-21.92 points) versus the placebo group (-9.60 points). Mean 
baseline DSQ scores were approximately 34 points. 
A nominally statistically significant effect in LS mean change in DSQ was noted by week 4 of dupilumab 
300 mg QW treatment and was sustained for the remainder of the 24-week treatment period.

The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Subgroup Analysis 
Descriptive analyses were performed on the primary endpoint results to summarize the treatment 
effects across the subgroups of age (≥12 to <18 years [adolescents] or ≥18 years [adults]), sex, 
baseline body weight (<60 kg or ≥60 kg), BMI, and baseline disease characteristics (including duration 
of EoE [<5 years or ≥5 years], history of prior swallowed topical steroid use for EoE, treatment with 
PPI at randomization by EDC and by IWRS, history of esophageal dilations, food elimination. A trend of 
dupilumab treatment benefit versus placebo was observed in all the subgroups analysed.  
Key Secondary Endpoints 
•  Percent Change from Baseline in Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count 
(eos/hpf) 
The percent change from baseline in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 24 was 
significantly greater (p<0.0001) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-71.24%) versus the placebo 
group (-2.98%). Sensitivity analysis also demonstrated a percent change from baseline in peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 24 that was nominally significantly greater 
(nominal p<0.0001 for both analyses) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus the placebo group. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to summarize the treatment effects across the subgroups of age 
(≥12 to <18 years or ≥18 years), sex, baseline body weight (<60 kg or ≥60 kg), BMI, and baseline 
disease characteristics. A trend of dupilumab treatment benefit versus placebo was observed in all the 
subgroups analysed and ANCOVA modelling of treatment-by-subgroup did not demonstrate any 
nominally statistically significant p-values <0.05 for the different subgroups that were evaluated. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in EoEHSS Mean Grade Score 
Treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW resulted in an improvement in Eosinophilic Esophagitis 
Histology Scoring System (EoEHSS) mean grade score compared to placebo at week 24. The LS mean 
change (reduction [i.e. improvement]) from baseline in EoEHSS mean grade score at week 24 was

significantly greater (p<0.0001) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-0.761 points) versus the 
placebo group (-0.001 points). Sensitivity analysis also demonstrated an absolute change from 
baseline in EoEHSS mean grade score at week 24 that was greater (nominal p<0.0001 for both 
analyses) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus the placebo group. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in EoEHSS Mean Stage Score 
Treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW resulted in an improvement in EoEHSS mean stage score 
compared to placebo at week 24. The LS mean change from baseline in EoEHSS mean stage score at 
week 24 was greater (p<0.0001) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-0.753 points) versus the 
placebo group (-0.012 points). Sensitivity analysis also demonstrated an absolute change from 
baseline in EoEHSS mean stage score at week 24 that was nominally significantly greater (nominal 
p<0.0001 for both analyses) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus the placebo group. Subgroup 
analyses showed a trend of dupilumab treatment benefit versus placebo in all the subgroups analysed. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in EoE-EREFS Total Score 
Treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW resulted in a significant improvement in EoE-EREFS total score 
compared to placebo at week 24. The LS mean change from baseline in EoE-EREFS total score at week 
24 was significantly greater (p<0.0001) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-3.2 points) versus the 
placebo group (-0.3 points). The results of the inflammation subscore at week 24 was greater in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group than in the placebo group (nominal p<0.0001), but the remodelling 
subscores did not demonstrate nominally significant p-values. Sensitivity analysis also demonstrated 
an absolute change from baseline in EoE-EREFS at week 24 that was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group versus the placebo group (nominal p<0.0001 for both analyses). A trend of dupilumab 
treatment benefit versus placebo was observed in all the subgroups analysed. 
•  Other Secondary Endpoints

(Part B FAS) 
Sensitivity analyses, using different imputation methods, showed similar results as the primary 
analysis and confirmed that, regardless of the assumptions used for missing data, treatment with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W produced a greater clinical effect size in comparison with placebo. 
Descriptive analyses were performed on the co-primary endpoint to summarize the treatment effects 
across several subgroups e.g. age (≥12 to <18 years or ≥18 years), sex, baseline body weight (<60 
kg or ≥60 kg), BMI (<25 kg/m2 or ≥25 to <30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2), and baseline disease 
characteristics, history of prior STC use for treatment of EoE and use of PPI at randomization. A 
consistent trend of dupilumab treatment benefit (Q2W and QW) versus placebo was observed in all the 
subgroups analysed. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ Total Score 
The DSQ e-diary was to be completed daily. The daily score ranged from 0 to 6 and biweekly total DSQ 
score from 0 to 84. A higher score indicates worse dysphagia. A minimum of 8 diary entries was 
required for each 14-day period to derive a standardized DSQ total score for the primary analysis. 
Mean baseline DSQ scores across the treatment groups were comparable.  
Treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW, but not dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, resulted in a significant 
improvement in DSQ total score compared to placebo at week 24 in participants with EoE.  The least 
square (LS) mean absolute change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 was −23.78 points in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (p<0.0001 vs placebo), −14.37 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group 
(p=0.8393 vs placebo), and −13.86 points in the placebo group. 
An improvement in DSQ was noted by week 4 of dupilumab 300 mg QW treatment and was sustained 
for the remainder of the 24-week treatment period. No significant difference versus placebo was noted 
with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W at any time point.

confirmed that, regardless of the assumptions used for missing data, treatment with dupilumab 300 
mg QW produced a clinically meaningful greater response compared to placebo. 
Supplemental analyses, using alternative strategies for the calculation of the DSQ biweekly total scores 
supported the primary analysis and confirmed that the treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW

In descriptive analyses a consistent treatment benefit versus placebo was noted for dupilumab 300 mg 
QW but not for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W across subgroups (e.g. age, sex, baseline body weight (<60 
kg or ≥60 kg), BMI (<25 kg/m2 or ≥25 to <30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2), and baseline disease 
characteristics). 
•  Key Secondary Endpoints 
Percent Change from Baseline in Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count 
(eos/hpf) 
The LS mean percent change from baseline in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 
24 showed greater decrease in count (i.e. improvement) in both the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(−80.24%) and 300 mg Q2W (−70.84%) groups than in the placebo group (+8.38%; nominal 
p<0.0001 vs placebo for both). 
Absolute Change from Baseline in EoEHSS Mean Grade Score 
The EoEHSS evaluates more detailed histologic changes than are captured by the co-primary endpoint 
of peak intraepithelial eosinophil counts. Severity (grade) and extent (stage) of abnormalities were 
scored by blinded, central pathologists using a 4-point scale (0 normal; 3 maximum change) for eight 
features: eosinophil density, basal zone hyperplasia, eosinophil abscesses, eosinophil surface layering, 
dilated intercellular spaces, surface epithelial alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells and lamina propria 
fibrosis (absent/present). Higher score indicates greater severity and extent of histological 
abnormalities. 
Treatment with either dupilumab 300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W resulted in greater decrease (i.e. 
improvement) in Eosinophilic Esophagitis Histology Scoring System (EoEHSS) mean grade score 
compared to placebo at week 24. The LS mean reduction from baseline in EoEHSS mean grade score 
at week 24 was substantially greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (−0.830 points) and 300 mg Q2W 
(−0.814 points) groups than in the placebo group (−0.148 points; nominal p<0.0001 vs placebo for 
both). 
Absolute Change from Baseline in EoEHSS Mean Stage Score 
Treatment with either dupilumab 300 mg QW or Q2W resulted in a nominally greater decrease (i.e. 
improvement) in EoEHSS mean stage score compared to placebo at week 24. The LS mean absolute

reduction from baseline in EoEHSS mean stage score at week 24 was substantially greater in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW (−0.804 points) and 300 mg Q2W (−0.793 points) groups than in the placebo 
group (−0.132 points; nominal p<0.0001 vs placebo for both). 
Absolute Change from Baseline in EoE-EREFS Total Score 
The EoE-EREFS is a validated endoscopic scoring system for inflammatory and remodelling features of 
EoE including oedema, rings, exudates, furrows, and stricture; the score was assessed in the proximal 
and distal esophageal regions with each region scored from 0 to 9 with total scores possibly ranging 
from 0 to 18. Higher score indicates worse endoscopic inflammatory and remodelling findings. 
Treatment with both dupilumab 300 mg QW and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W resulted in improvement 
(i.e., decrease) in EoE-EREFS total score compared to placebo at week 24. The LS mean reduction 
from baseline in EoE-EREFS total score at week 24 was substantially greater in both the dupilumab 300 
mg QW (−4.5 points) and 300 mg Q2W (−4.6 points) groups than in the placebo group (−0.6 points; 
nominal p<0.0001 vs placebo for both) (Table 30). The results of the inflammation and remodelling 
subscores at week 24 also showed greater improvement in both the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 
mg Q2W groups than in the placebo group (nominal p<0.0001 vs placebo for both). 
•  Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Due to high number of endpoints evaluated in the study not all results are described in detail. 
However, the results of the other secondary endpoints are in line with the results of the key secondary 
endpoints showing greater improvement of signs and symptoms in participants with EoE in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW treatment group compared to placebo.

into tissue, is up-regulated in esophageal mucosa of EoE patients relative to controls. Near maximal 
reductions from baseline were observed in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W treatment groups as 
early as week 4, the first post-treatment time point assessed in the study. These reductions remained 
sustained through week 24. Much smaller median reductions were noted in the placebo group 
compared to the dupilumab groups. At week 24, 56.23% and 55.49% reductions from baseline in 
median concentrations were observed in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W groups, respectively. 
Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine (TARC): Interleukin-4 and IL-13 induce the mRNA 
expression of TARC, a type 2 chemokine that attracts inflammatory cells to tissue. near maximal 
reductions from baseline were observed in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W treatment groups as 
early as week 4, the first post-treatment time point assessed in the study. These reductions were 
sustained through week 24, and slightly greater in the dupilumab Q2W group than QW group. Much 
smaller median reductions were noted in the placebo group compared to both dupilumab groups. At 
week 24, 26.61% and 36.14% reductions from baseline in median concentrations were observed in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W groups, respectively, relative to 7.55% median reduction observed in 
the placebo group. 
Total IgE: Significant median reductions from baseline were observed in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
and Q2W treatment groups as early as week 4, the first post-treatment time point assessed in the 
study. The serum total IgE levels in both dupilumab groups continued to decrease through week 24 
compared to much smaller median reductions in the placebo group. At week 24, 49.22% and 50.17% 
reductions from baseline in median concentrations were observed in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 
Q2W groups relative to 3.67% median reduction observed in the placebo group.

Table 19 Key Efficacy Parameters at Week 52 in the Adolescents Versus Adults, All Observed 
Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment Use (Part C SAF – Participants from Part A) 
There were no primary efficacy endpoints for Part C of the study. 
Efficacy endpoints assessed at week 24 for Part A were assessed at week 52 as secondary endpoints 
for Part C of the study and summarized for Part C SAF participants who entered Part C from Part A as a 
single group, as well as based on the treatment assignment in Part A (as randomized). 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil 
Count of ≤6 eos/hpf 
At the baseline of Part C, the mean peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of 3 regions was 
lower in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (12.3 eos/hpf) than in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (66.7 eos/hpf). 
At the baseline of Part C, 26 of 38 (68.4%) participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 
mg QW group achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf. Six participants 
had their week 24 biopsy performed after their first Part C dose of study drug (ranged from 2 to 17 
days) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from these biopsies were not considered as Part C 
baseline. 
After an additional 28 weeks of dupilumab 300 mg QW treatment in Part C (i.e., through week 52), 
55.9% of participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had a peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf in all 3 regions, indicating a maintenance of 
effect with continued treatment. 6 participants achieved histological remission at week 24 (peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eos/hpf ≤6) which was not maintained at week 52, although all participants 
had peak intraepithelial eosinophils/hpf well below baseline. Five of these 6 participants maintained 
peak esophageal eosinophils below 15 eos/hpf and all maintained or improved their DSQ. Five of the 6 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

also maintained or improved their EREFS scores. Therefore, this slight increase in the esophageal 
eosinophilic count did not correlate with worsening of symptoms or anatomical changes. Additional 3 
participants achieved histological remission at week 24 but histological assessments were unavailable 
at week 52. Two other participants dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group did not 
achieve histological remission at week 24 but achieved it at week 52 
For participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in Part 
C, 18 of 30 (60.0%) participants achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 
eos/hpf in all 3 regions at week 52. This finding is consistent with the effect seen in the dupilumab 
group during Part A.  
Table 20 Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count ≤6 
eos/hpf in All 3 Regions at Week 52, All Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment Use 
(Part C SAF –Participants from Part A) 
Adolescents 
A consistent trend of dupilumab treatment benefit was observed when evaluated for the subgroups of 
age (≥12 to <18 years and ≥18 years). 3 of 9 (33.3%) adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 6/8 (75.0%) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 52. Two adolescent 
participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at baseline of Part C but were no longer responders at week 
52.  
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ Total Score 
Absolute Change from Part A Baseline 
Participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group maintained their improvement 
(decrease in score) in DSQ total score (possible score ranges from 0 to 84) from Part A during Part C. 
In the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the mean (SD) change from the Part A 
baseline was -21.15 points at the Part C baseline (week 24) and -23.44 points at week 52. 
Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in Part C 
showed progressive improvement during Part C. The mean change from the Part A baseline was -21.71 
points at week 52. This change was similar to that noted for the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 
mg QW group at the Part C baseline.

Figure 13 Mean (±SE) of Absolute Change in DSQ Total Score to Each Visit from Baseline of Part 
A, All Observed Values (Part C SAF – Participants From Part A) 
There was also a trend of a slight increase in total DSQ score after discontinuation of dupilumab during 
the post-treatment 12-week follow-up period. 
Absolute Change from Part C Baseline 
The mean change in DSQ total score from the Part C baseline was ˗1.75 for participants in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showing a maintenance of effect from the end of 
Part A. Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showed progressive improvement 
from the start of dupilumab treatment in Part C. The mean change from the Part C baseline was -9.79 
points at week 52. 
A consistent trend of dupilumab treatment benefit was observed when evaluated for the subgroups of 
age (≥12 to <18 years and ≥18 years) and history of prior use of swallowed topical steroid for EoE. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in EoE-EREFS Total Score 
The EoE-EREFS is a validated classification and grading system designed to standardize nomenclature 
for the major endoscopically identified esophageal features of EoE (edema, rings, exudates, furrows, 
and strictures). 
Absolute Change from Part A Baseline 
The participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showed maintenance of 
effect in EoE-EREFS total score (possible score ranges from 0 to 18) with continued treatment. The 
mean change from the Part A baseline total score was -4.1 points at the Part C baseline (week 24) and 
-4.1 points at week 52. Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started 
dupilumab treatment in Part C also showed improvement in EoE-EREFS total score. The mean change 
from the Part A baseline was -0.8 points at week 24 and -3.9 points at week 52 similar to that in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group at the Part C baseline. 
Absolute Change from Part C Baseline 
The mean change in EoE-EREFS total score at week 52 was 0.0 points from the Part C baseline for 
participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showing a maintenance of 
effect from the end of Part A, and -3.4 points from the Part C baseline for participants in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showing progressive improvement from start of dupilumab 
treatment in Part C. 
A consistent trend of dupilumab treatment benefit was observed when evaluated for the subgroups of 
age (≥12 to <18 years and ≥18 years) and history of prior use of swallowed topical steroid for EoE.

•  Percent Change from Baseline in EoE-EREFS Total Score from Part A Baseline 
In the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group; the mean percent change in EoE-EREFS 
total score from the Part A baseline was −48.51% at the Part C baseline (week 24) and −62.06% at 
week 52. Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in 
Part C showed consistent improvement. The mean percent change from the Part A baseline was 
−65.54% at week 52. 
•  Percent Change from Baseline in Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count 
The mean percent change from the Part A baseline was −85.14% at the Part C baseline (week 24; 
N=38) and −88.59% at week 52 showing sustained improvement in participants in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group with continued dupilumab treatment. Participants in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in Part C showed similar 
improvement at week. The mean percent change from the Part A baseline in the placebo/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group was -83.76% at week 52. 
The median percent change from the Part C baseline was -15.56% at week 52 for participants in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and -93.26% for participants in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW-group who started dupilumab treatment in Part C 
A consistent trend of dupilumab treatment benefit was observed when evaluated for the subgroups of 
age (≥12 to <18 years and ≥18 years) and history of prior use of swallowed topical steroid for EoE. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in EoEHSS Mean Grade Score 
EoE Grade and Stage Scores evaluate eight histological features in the esophageal biopsy specimens: 
eosinophil density, basal zone hyperplasia, eosinophil abscesses, eosinophil surface layering, dilated 
intercellular spaces, surface epithelial alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, and lamina propria 
fibrosis (absent/present). Severity (grade) and extent (stage) of abnormalities were scored using a 4-
point scale (0 normal; 3 maximum change). 
Participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showed sustained 
improvement in EoEHSS mean grade score during Part C. The mean change from the Part A baseline 
was -0.866 points at the Part C baseline (week 24) and −0.873 points at week 52. 
Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in Part C 
showed improvement in EoEHSS mean grade score at week 52. The mean change from the Part A 
baseline was -0.873 points at week 52. The improvement in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
at week 52 was therefore similar to the improvement in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group during Part A. 
At week 52, the mean change in EoEHSS mean grade score was −0.006 points from the Part C 
baseline for participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, which indicates 
maintenance of efficacy. Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showed 
improvement from start of dupilumab treatment in Part C with a mean change in EoEHSS mean grade 
score at week 52 of -0.723 points from the Part C baseline. 
•  Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil 
Count of <15 eos/hpf 
28 of 34 (82.4%) participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count <15 eos/hpf at week 52, suggesting sustained 
reduction of esophageal eosinophilic inflammation with continued dupilumab treatment. For 
participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in Part C, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 71/179 
 
 
 
 
21 of 30 (70.0%) participants achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count <15 eos/hpf 
in all 3 regions at week 52. 
•  Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil 
Count of ≤1 eos/hpf 
10 of 34 (29.4%) participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤1 eos/hpf at week 52. For participants in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started dupilumab treatment in Part C, 8/30 participants 
(26.7%) achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤1 eos/hpf in all 3 regions at 
week 52. 
•  Absolute Change from Baseline in Health-related QOL Average Score by EoE Impact 
Questionnaire (EoE-IQ) 
The EoE-IQ is a disease-specific measure of health-related QOL that measures impact of EoE on 
emotional, social, work and school, and sleep aspect of a patient. Score ranges from 1 to 5 with higher 
score indicating worse HRQOL. 
Participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group maintained improvement in 
health-related QOL average score by EoE-IQ from Part A with continued dupilumab treatment in Part 
C. The mean change from the Part A baseline was -0.628 points at the Part C baseline (week 24) and -
0.911 points at week 52. Participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started 
dupilumab treatment in Part C showed progressive improvement; the mean change from the Part A 
baseline was −0.954 points at week 52. 
•  Other Secondary Endpoints 
Due to high number of endpoints evaluated in the study not all results are described in detail. 
However, all other evaluated endpoints showed similar results to the above presented endpoints with 
maintenance of the treatment effect in in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 
improvement of signs and symptoms in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group at week 52 similar 
to the results seen in the dupilumab group in Part A. 
Eotaxin-3 (from heparinized plasma), TARC, and IgE (total and allergen-specific) are believed to be 
relevant to the pathophysiology of EoE and response to treatment (i.e., assessment of type 2 
inflammation). Consistent with the results of Part A, dupilumab treatment in Part C maintained 
reductions in plasma eotaxin-3, as well as serum TARC and total IgE from the Part A baseline in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and showed reductions in these biomarkers in 
the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
As in Part A, median reductions from the Part A baseline were observed in allergen-specific IgEs (cow’s 
milk, dermatophagoides farina, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, egg white, peanuts, soybean) and 
sIgG4s (egg white, peanuts, soybean, and wheat) in both the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 
mg QW and placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW treatment groups. These median reductions in allergen-
specific IgEs and IgG4s continued through week 52.

Table 21 R668-EE-1774 Part B/C - Results for Selected Secondary Efficacy Endpoints at Week 52 
(Part B/C SAF) 
In Part B/C, numerically greater effects in all endpoints were observed in participants treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW for 52 weeks (dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group) compared 
with those treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group).  
Furthermore, efficacy in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group continued to 
improve during Part C. In Part B 58.8% of participants had achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count ≤6/hpf at Week 24, while 84.6% had achieved this after 52 weeks. In addition, 100% 
of participants achieved an eos count of <15/hpf at 52 weeks on 300 mg QW (74.9% after 24 weeks).  
Similarly, DSQ scores continued to improve in Part B participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg QW/ 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group from -23.78 at 24 weeks to -30.26 at 52 weeks.

Figure 14 Summary of Absolute Change in DSQ Total Score From Part B Baseline to Week 64, All 
Observed Values Regardless of Rescue Treatment Use (R668-EE-1774 Part C Safety Analysis Set - 
Patients from Part B) 
The participants who previously received placebo achieved improvements after 28 weeks on dupilumab 
300 mg QW in Part C that were similar to those observed for participants who received 24 weeks of 
dupilumab treatment during Part B.  
In summary, the additional Part B/C efficacy data for up to one year provide further evidence that 
treatment with dupilumab 300 mg QW shows clinically meaningful efficacy in the treatment EoE 
patients.

Eosinophil Count ≤6 eos/hpf at Week 24 
The proportion of adolescent participants (≥12 to <18 years) who achieved a peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was greater in both the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(15/26; 57.7%) and 300 mg Q2W (13/27; 48.1%) groups than in the placebo group (2/26; 7.7%). 
The improvements in the dupilumab groups followed a similar pattern to those in adult participants 
(≥18 years). 
Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ Total Score 
The improvement from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 for adolescent participants (≥12 to <18 
years) was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (−19.54) group than in the placebo group (−16.42). 
However, the improvement in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (−12.14) group was less than that in the 
placebo group.  
Overall, in adult participants (≥18 years), the effect of treatment on DSQ total score at week 24 was 
greater than in adolescents in both dupilumab 300 mg groups (QW and Q2W) than in the placebo 
group. This difference might be a function of a greater change from baseline in the placebo group 
observed in adolescents relative to adult participants.

•  Selected Key Secondary endpoints 
Percent Change from Baseline in Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count (eos/hpf) 
The percent decrease from baseline in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count at week 24 in 
adolescents (≥12 to <18 years) was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (-74.56%) and 300 mg 
Q2W (−46.32%) groups than in the placebo group (+5.66%). These improvements in adolescent 
participants for the dupilumab 300 mg regimen were similar to those in the adult participants. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in EoE-EREFS Total Score 
The LS mean decrease from baseline in EoE-EREFS total score at week 24 in adolescent participants 
(≥12 to <18 years) was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (−3.7 points) and 300 mg Q2W (−4.1 
points) groups than in the placebo group (−0.0 points). Overall, the LS mean placebo-corrected 
decreases in adolescent participants were consistent with those in the adult participants for both 
dupilumab regimens. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in EoEHSS Mean Grade Score 
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in EoEHSS mean grade score at week 24 in adolescent 
participants (≥12 to <18 years) showed greater reduction in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (−0.773 
points) and 300 mg Q2W (−0.750 points) groups than in the placebo group (−0.180 points).

3 of 9 (33.3%) adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 
6/8 (75.0%) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf in all 3 regions at week 52. Two adolescent participants in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count 
≤6 eos/hpf at baseline of Part C but were no longer responders at week 52.

Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ Total Score 
Adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group maintained 
improvement in DSQ total score with continued treatment during Part C. The mean change from the 
Part A baseline (36.21) was -24.80 points at the Part C baseline (week 24; N=10) and −25.57 points 
at week 52 (N=6). Adolescent participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started 
dupilumab treatment in Part C showed progressive improvement. The mean change from the Part A 
baseline (36.04) was -25.45 points at week 52 (N=5). 
The mean change in DSQ total score at week 52 was -3.97 points from the Part C baseline (11.41 
points) for the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (N=6) showing maintained

Participants from Part B 
Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count ≤6 eos/hpf 
Table 27 Summary of number of adolescent patients (%) with peak eosphageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf in all three regions at week 52, all observed values regardless of 
rescue treatment use (Part C Safety Analysis Set – Patients from Part B) 
The dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW treated group demonstrated continued 
improvement in the proportion of adolescent participants who achieved a peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf in all 3 regions of the esophagus (histologic remission) at 
Week 52. At baseline of Part C (Week 24), 16/24 (66.7%) adolescents treated with dupilumab 300 mg 
QW achieved histologic remission. The results from Part B/C show continued improvement with 18/22 
(81.8%) adolescent participants achieving histological remission at Week 52. The dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group also demonstrated sustained improvement. Fourteen out of 26 
(53.8%) participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W achieved histologic remission at Week 24, 
with 15/25 (60.0%) of participants achieving histological remission in all 3 regions at Week 52.  
This observation is consistent with the Part B data, showing that highest rates in histologic response in 
adolescent participants are reached with the 300 mg QW dosing regimen.

Page 80/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results from Part B/C show that adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group maintained improvement in DSQ total score, with lower scores with continued 
treatment during Part C. The mean absolute change from the Part B baseline was -22.26 points at the 
Part C baseline (Week 24; N=24) and -26.86 points at Week 52 (N=15).  
The adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group also showed 
improvement at Week 52. However, the magnitude of improvements in DSQ total score achieved were 
lower than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, either at Week 24 or Week 52. The mean absolute 
change from the Part B baseline was -17.00 points at Week 52 (N=16).  
Based on these results from the 300 mg Q2W treatment group, the treatment effect improves but the 
results are of lesser extent. 
Pooled Analyses by age 
Table 29 Subgroup Analysis of Proportion of Patients with Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial 
Eosinophil Count of ≤6 eos/hpf in All Three Regions at Week 24 by Age Group 
In Pool 1, the Co-Primary Endpoints were analysed by age.  
The results show that in the ≥12 to <18 years of age group, the proportion of participants who 
achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was 19/37 (51.4%) 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus 2/35 (5.7%) in the placebo group. In the ≥18 years of age 
group, the proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 
eos/hpf at week 24 was 53/85 (62.4%) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus 5/83 (6.0%) in the 
placebo group. 
In the ≥12 to <18 years of age group, the improvement in DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 
was -21.07 points in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (n=37) and -17.23 points in the placebo group 
(n=35). 
When compared to the ≥18 years of age subgroup, the improvement from baseline in DSQ total score 
at week 24 relative to placebo in the adolescent subgroup was numerically smaller than the adult 
subgroup likely due to a higher placebo effect.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023

In the ≥18 years of age group, the LS mean absolute change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 
24 was -23.57 points in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (n=85) and -10.06 points in the placebo 
group (n=83) (LS mean difference [95% CI]: -13.50 [-17.936, -9.073]). 
➢  Additional Data 
Part A  
The R668-EE-1774 Part A Clinical Study Report contained the final analysis of data from the 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Part A of the study. The report contained all Part A data 
through 08 May 2020 (data cut-off). The final database lock for Part A occurred on 20 May 2020. 
Four participants had not completed their Part A week 24 biopsy at the time of the data cut-off, due to 
not being able to attend study visits because of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
As a result, all 4 participants were allowed to extend their assigned Part A dose regimen of study drug 
beyond the week 23 injection until the post-baseline esophageal biopsy procedure(s) were performed. 
All 4 participants had some interruptions to study treatment and a delayed week 24 visit. Their data up 
to the Part A data cut-off were included in the Part A CSR, including their Dysphagia Symptom 
Questionnaire (DSQ) data though week 24 (which were not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic) for 
the primary analysis. 
One serious adverse event (SAE) that was reported approximately 14 months after the onset of the 
event, and hence after the data cut-off.  2 adverse events of Arthralgia were re-categorized as adverse 
events of special interest. A pregnancy was reported in a participant who had requested to withdraw 
from the study, but who could not attend an early termination visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
These events have been included in the relevant sections of the AR. 
No new analyses were performed or data summaries produced. The listed data from the 4 participants 
who completed Part A after data cut-off are consistent with the overall efficacy and safety conclusions 
in the Part A CSR. 
Part C 
The completed R668-EE-1774 Part A-C clinical study report contained the final analysis of data from 
the 28-week extended active treatment phase enrolling patients from Part A. The report contained all 
data through 18 Nov 2020 (data cut-off). The database lock occurred on 17 Dec 2020. 
Six participants were ongoing in Part C at the time of the data cut-off for the Part A-C CSR. This 
addendum summarizes their Part C data obtained after the data cut-off. Individual patient data profiles 
were provided that include all data from 18 Nov 2020 up to last patient last visit (LPLV) (27 May 
2021). 
No new analyses were performed or data summaries were produced. Of the 6 participants, 2 had 
completed dosing with dupilumab at the time of the 18 Nov 2020 data cut-off. The 4 patients with 
Continued dosing had a range of 2-14 additional doses. For all 4 of the participants with additional 
DSQ data, DSQ scores remained below the Part A or Part C baseline values for the duration of the 
study. The data from the 6 participants who completed Part C after the data cut-off are consistent with 
the overall efficacy and safety conclusions in the Part A-C CSR.

Pool 1 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 90/179 
 
 
 
 
Pooling of data for Part A and Part B were performed to ensure an adequate sample size for subgroup 
analyses of efficacy for the co-primary efficacy endpoints (Pool 1). Pool 1 was used for analyses of the 
additional clinico-pathologic remission endpoint and for efficacy subgroup analyses of the histologic 
remission and clinical symptoms endpoints.  
The clinico-pathological remission (defined as proportion of patients who achieved peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eos< 6 per hpf and ≥30% reduction (improvement) from baseline in DSQ total score at 
Week 24) evaluated treatment effects of dupilumab in improving both dysphagia symptom and 
esophageal histology concurrently. Responder analyses of the treatment effects on clinico-pathologic 
remission were performed on the FAS dataset of study R668-EE- 1774 for participants in Part A 
(dupilumab 300 mg QW vs. placebo), Part B (dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W vs. placebo) 
and participants in Parts A and B pooled who received the proposed to-be-marketed dose of dupilumab 
300 mg QW (referred to as Pool 1). 
Table 32 Analysis of Proportion of Patients with Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count 
of ≤6 eos/hpf in All Three Regions and DSQ Improvement of ≥30% at Week 24 (Pool 1 - Full 
Analysis Set) 
The results showed greater proportion of dupilumab-treated participants achieved clinico-pathologic 
remission compared to placebo-treated participants in Part A, Part B and the Pool 1 population. The 
results were consistent between Parts A and B and Pool 1, with a nominally significant difference 
observed (p<0.0001) compared to placebo. 
Descriptive analyses were performed on the co-primary endpoints to summarize the treatment effects 
across 13 subgroups (e.g. Age (≥12 to < 18 years, ≥18 years), Sex (Male, Female), Race (White, 
Black or African American/Asian/Other/ Not Reported), Duration of EoE (<5 years, ≥5 years), Prior use

of swallowed topical steroids (STC) for the treatment of EoE (Yes, No)). Dupilumab 300 mg QW 
demonstrated a consistent effect on the proportion of participants in both Part A and Part B of R668-
EE-1774 who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 and 
absolute change in DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 compared to placebo across all 
subgroups assessed, including in particular age, gender, history of atopic dermatitis, history of asthma, 
history of food allergy, and previous use of STC for EoE.

Previous use of Swallowed Topical Steroids (STC) for EoE 
In the Pool 1, when the co-primary endpoint was analysed by previous use of STC for EoE (yes or no), 
the results were consistent between those participants with or without prior STC use. 
In the group with a prior history of STC use for EoE, the proportion of participants who achieved peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was 50/84 (59.5%) in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus 3/87 (3.4%) in the placebo group (difference 95% CI: 58.2 
[46.91, 69.58]).  
In the group without a prior history of STC use for EoE, the proportion of participants who achieved 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was 22/38 [57.9%] in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus 4/31 [12.9%] in the placebo group (difference 95% CI: 46.6 
[25.93, 67.22])

In the Pool 1, the magnitude of response in the Absolute Change in DSQ Total Score From Baseline to 
Week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW was numerically higher in the subgroup who had a prior history 
of STC use for EoE compared to the one without prior STC use. In the group with a prior history of STC 
use for EoE, the LS mean absolute change in DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 was -24.27 
points in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (n=84) and -11.02 points in the placebo group (n=87) (LS 
mean difference [95% CI]: -13.25 [-18.014, -8.482]). In the group without a prior history of STC use 
for EoE, the LS mean absolute change in DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 was −18.54 points 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (n=38) and -12.90 points in the placebo group (n=31) (LS mean 
difference [95% CI]: -5.64 [-12.691, 1.407]).

Supportive study (R668-EE-1324) 
Methods 
Study design 
Study R668-EE-1324 was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study investigating the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of dupilumab in adult 
patients with EoE. 
After providing informed consent, patients were assessed at the screening visit (to occur between day 
-35 and day -1) for eligibility to participate in the study. Patients who met the eligibility criteria 
underwent day 1 baseline assessments and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 
mg QW or placebo during the 12-week double-blind treatment phase. The end of treatment period visit 
occurred at week 12, 1 week after the last dose of study drug. Patients were followed off-study drug 
for an additional 16 weeks. The end of study visit occurred at week 28. 
Patients could receive concomitant medications (except for prohibited medications) as needed, at the 
discretion of the investigator, while continuing study treatment. Frequency of use and type of product 
were documented. If medically necessary, rescue medications (e.g., systemic and swallowed topical 
corticosteroids) or emergency esophageal dilation could be provided to study patients. Patients 
receiving rescue therapy were to be discontinued from study treatment. These patients were to remain 
blinded and to be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study treatment visits and participate in 
all follow-up assessments according to the visit schedule. 
•  Study participants 
Approximately 44 patients were planned to be enrolled at up to 20 study sites in the US. 
Eligible for inclusion in the study were male or female patients from 18 to 65 years of age with a 
documented diagnosis of EoE by endoscopy prior to or at screening and history of on average at least 
2 episodes of dysphagia (with intake of solids off anti-inflammatory therapy) per week in the 4 weeks 
prior to screening and on average at least 2 episodes of documented dysphagia per week in the weeks 
between screening and baseline. Furthermore a SDI PRO score ≥5 at screening and baseline 
documented history of or presence of allergic disease (e.g., allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, AD, or 
food allergies), peripheral eosinophil counts ≥0.25 GI/L, or serum total IgE ≥100 kU/L were required. 
Excluded were patients with hypereosinophilic syndromes, Churg-Strauss vasculitis, eosinophilic 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023

gastroenteritis, a history of achalasia, active Helicobacter pylori infection, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative 
colitis, celiac disease, prior esophageal surgery prior to screening, any esophageal stricture unable to 
be passed with a standard upper endoscope or any critical esophageal stricture that requires dilation at 
screening, history of bleeding disorders or esophageal varices.  
•  Treatments 
Patients were to receive SC dupilumab 300 mg or matching placebo during the 12-week double-
blind treatment phase. Patients were to receive 2 injections (300-mg initial dose, followed by a 300-
mg loading dose) on day 1, followed by weekly injections. 
Dupilumab was provided in 5 mL vials. Each vial contained 2.5 mL (150 mg/mL) with a withdrawable 
volume of 2.0 mL or 300 mg of study drug. 
Placebo matching dupilumab was prepared in the same formulation as dupilumab without the addition 
of protein (i.e., active substance, anti-IL-4R monoclonal antibody). 
If medically necessary (e.g., for treatment of intolerable EoE symptoms) patients could be rescued 
with a prohibited medication or procedure including swallowed topical corticosteroids, systemic 
corticosteroids, start or dose change of systemic leukotriene inhibitors, topical, nasal, and/or inhaled 
corticosteroids, systemic treatment for EoE with an immunosuppressive substance (e.g. omalizumab, 
cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate) and esophageal dilation. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy of repeat SC doses of 
dupilumab, compared with placebo, to relieve symptoms in adult patients with active, moderate-to-
severe EoE. 
The secondary objectives of the study were: 
- 
To assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SC doses of dupilumab in adult 
patients with active, moderate-to-severe EoE 
- 
- 
To assess the effect of dupilumab on esophageal eosinophilic infiltration 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dupilumab in adult patients with EoE 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint in the study was the change in the SDI PRO score from baseline to week 10. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
- 
Percent change in weekly EEsAI PRO score from baseline to week 10 
-  Change in weekly EEsAI PRO score from baseline to week 10

•  Sample size 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 95/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A sample size of 18 patients per treatment arm was planned in order to provide 94% power to detect a 
treatment effect, with an expected mean difference of 3 points in change from baseline to week 12 in 
SDI score between dupilumab and placebo at a 2-sided t-test with 5% significance level and an 
assumed SD of 2.46. Considering the assumed 15% dropouts, 22 patients per treatment arm were 
planned to be enrolled. 
•  Randomisation 
1:1 allocation to receive either dupilumab every week (loading dose 600mg, followed by 300 mg 
doses; N=23) or placebo (N=24), stratified by baseline SDI PRO score (≥5 and ≤7 versus >7; total 
possible score ranges from 0 to 9) that reflects EoE severity and frequency. 
•  Blinding (masking) 
Double-blind study until week 12. 
•  Statistical methods 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses were based on the 
treatment allocated by the IVRS/IWRS at randomization (as randomized). This was the primary 
analysis population for efficacy analyses. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, change in SDI score at week 10 from baseline, was analyzed in the FAS 
using multiple imputation (MI), with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group 
as fixed effect, and the baseline SDI value as continuous covariate (time point for the primary endpoint 
was changed from week 12 to week 10 in protocol amendment 4). Due to the substantial imbalance at 
baseline in the number of patients in the 2 randomization strata (only 12.8% patients in the strata of 
baseline SDI >7), the randomization strata was not used as a factor in the multiple imputation and 
ANCOVA model. Instead, as specified in the SAP, the baseline SDI was included as a continuous 
covariate in the MI and ANCOVA model. 
Missing values, sensitivity analyses: 
If a patient used rescue treatment during the 12-week treatment period, patients’ efficacy data after 
rescue treatment were to be set to missing first, and then imputed by the MI method. No patients used 
a rescue medication or procedure during the study. Missing data from the FAS were imputed 50 times 
to generate 50 complete data sets. 
In addition to the MI method described above, sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint 
were conducted as described below: 
1. All observed data with MI for imputing missing values: ANCOVA analysis based on all observed data 
no matter whether rescue medication was used. MI method was used to impute missing values. 
Because no patients used rescue treatment, this analysis was the same as the primary analysis. 
2. Last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method: ANCOVA model with efficacy data set to missing 
after rescue medication was used. The post-baseline LOCF method was used to impute missing values.  
3. Worst observation carried forward (WOCF) method: ANCOVA model with efficacy data set to missing 
after rescue medication was used. The post-baseline WOCF method was then be used to impute 
missing values. 
4. All observed data without data imputation: ANCOVA model including all observed data no matter if 
rescue medication was used, without imputation for missing data. 
No interim analysis was planned according to the protocol and no interim analysis was performed 
accordingly.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
80 patients were screened, of whom 47 (58.7%) were enrolled at 14 sites. Thirty-three (41.3%) 
patients were considered screen failures as they did not meet all inclusion criteria or met one or more 
exclusion criterion (32 patients), or withdrew consent (1 patient). Of the 47 enrolled patients, 23 
patients were randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW and 24 patients were randomized to 
receive placebo. 
Table 35 Summary of Patients Disposition (SAF) 
The majority of the randomized patients completed the study treatment, with the percentage of 
patients in the dupilumab group (95.7% of patients) slightly higher than in the placebo group (83.3% 
of patients).  
One patient in the dupilumab group discontinued study treatment due to an AE (Nail Disorder).

o  Add SDI and EEsAI at telephone visits, and add a note to indicate that SDI and EEsAI should 
be performed by the patient electronically 
o  Add electronic patient diary in the list of electronic systems used in this study  
The primary purpose of Amendment 2 (dated 08 May 2015) was to update the number of study sites 
and the enrolment criteria based on the principal investigators’ feedback. 
The primary purposes of Amendment 3 (dated 04 May 2016) were to modify inclusion criterion #2 
and clarify inclusion criteria #6 and #10 and exclusion criteria #9 and #16. 
The purposes of Amendment 4 (dated 16 Oct 2016) were to modify the primary endpoint to have 
change from baseline to week 10 instead of to week 12 to ensure an adequate amount of data for 
analysis, due to failure with electronic diaries. The list of secondary endpoints was modified as a result 
of changing the primary endpoint to week 10. The statistical plan was updated accordingly to previous 
changes. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 3 patients in each treatment group had a major protocol deviation. The types of major 
protocol deviations were unlikely to impact the results of the study. Nonetheless, the primary efficacy 
endpoint was evaluated in the PPS as a supportive analysis, which excluded patients with major 
protocol violations. 
Note: the missing patient-reported data due to failure of the eDiary were not defined as protocol 
deviations.  
•  Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were balanced between the dupilumab group and the placebo group 
except for the sex composition and body weight categories. There were more male patients (56.5%) in 
the dupilumab group while there were more female patients (58.3%) in the placebo group. In the 
dupilumab group there were a higher percentage of patients with body weight <70 kg (30.4% 
patients) or ≥100 kg (30.4% patients) than in placebo group (20.8% and 16.7%, respectively). 
The baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment groups for most of the 
parameters, except mean/median serum total IgE, composition of patients with IgE <100 IU/mL or IgE 
≥100 IU/mL. All patients had a baseline SDI PRO score ≥5, reflecting all patients met the inclusion 
criterion of SDI PRO score ≥5 at screening and baseline.

The absolute change in SDI total score from baseline to week 10 was significantly greater in the 
dupilumab group than in the placebo group. The LS mean change of -3.0 points in the dupilumab 
group indicates a clinically meaningful improvement. A reduction from baseline in SDI total score of ≥3 
points is considered a clinical response, compared to a LS mean change of -1.3 points in the placebo

group. The difference in LS mean of absolute change from baseline between the 2 treatment groups 
was statistically significant (p-value = 0.0304).

The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. 
A trend of dupilumab treatment benefit versus placebo was observed in majority of the subgroups. It is 
noted that for the female subgroup, the LS mean difference between dupilumab and placebo in change 
of SDI score from baseline at week 10 was close to zero (-0.1) and the associated 95% CI (-2.15, 
2.01) included 0, while for the male subgroup the LS mean difference (95% CI) were -3.1 (-5.31, -
0.95). 
•  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (selected) 
Percent Change in SDI PRO Total Score from Baseline to Week 10 
The results of percent change in SDI total score from baseline to week 10 were similar to that of 
absolute change (decrease) in SDI total score from baseline to week 10. A greater percent change 
(decrease) from baseline to week 10 was observed in the dupilumab group (-45.05%) than in the 
placebo group (-18.59%). 
Sensitivity analyses, using different imputation methods (LOCF, WOCF, and all observed data without 
data imputation) supported the same conclusions as those generated from the primary analysis. 
Change in SDI Total Score from Baseline to Week 12 
The results of absolute change in SDI total score from baseline at week 12 were similar to that at week 
10. However, the numbers of patients with an observed value at week 12 were small, resulting in a 
wider 95% CI that contained 0 for the LS mean difference between the placebo and dupilumab groups. 
Sensitivity analyses, using different imputation methods (LOCF, WOCF, and observed data without 
data imputation), showed results similar to those generated from the primary analysis. 
Percent Change in SDI Total Score from Baseline to Week 12 
The results of percent change in SDI total score from baseline at week 12 were similar to that of 
absolute change in SDI total score from baseline at week 12. 
Sensitivity analyses supported the analyses. 
Proportion of Patients Achieving a Reduction of ≥3 Points in SDI Total Score from Baseline 
at Week 10 
During the study treatment period up to week 12, an upward trend in percentage of patients achieving 
a ≥3-point reduction in SDI total score was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo

group. At week 10, 39.1% of patients in the dupilumab group achieved this responder status compared 
to 12.5 % in the placebo group. 
Proportion of Patients Achieving a Reduction of ≥3 Points in SDI Total Score from Baseline 
at Week 12 
The results in percentage of patients achieving a reduction of ≥3 points in SDI total score at week 12 
were similar to that at week 10. At week 12, 34.8% of patients in the dupilumab group achieved this 
responder status compared to 4.2% in the placebo group. 
Percent Change in Weekly Reported EEsAI from Baseline to Week 10 
During the study treatment period up to week 12, a downward trend in LS mean percent change from 
baseline in weekly reported EEsAI was observed in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo 
group. At week 10, the LS mean (SE) percent change from baseline was -34.56% (9.076%) for the 
dupilumab group compared to -11.33% (9.915%) for the placebo group. 
Change in Weekly Reported EEsAI from Baseline to Week 12 
A downward trend in LS mean absolute change from baseline in weekly reported EEsAI was observed 
in the dupilumab group compared to the placebo group. At week 12, the LS mean (SE) absolute 
change from baseline was -26.1 (5.87) for the dupilumab group compared to -5.0 (7.06) for the 
placebo group. 
Proportion of Patients Achieving ≥40% Improvement in Weekly Reported EEsAI from 
Baseline at Week 10 
At week 10, 26.1% of patients in the dupilumab group achieved this responder status compared to 
8.3% for the placebo group.  
Proportion of Patients Achieving ≥40% Improvement in Weekly Reported EEsAI Score from 
Baseline at Week 12 
The results in percentage of ≥40% EEsAI improvement responders at week 12 were similar to that at 
week 10, however, the difference between the dupilumab group and placebo group was greater. At 
week 12, 39.1% of patients in the dupilumab group achieved this responder status compared to 4.2% 
in the placebo group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study R668-EE-1774 was a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, pivotal phase 3 study to 
evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab treatment compared with placebo in adult and adolescent patients 
with EoE. This study consisted of 3 parts. Part A and Part B consisted of a 24-week double-blind 
treatment period each, Part C of a 28-week extended active treatment period. A 12-week post 
treatment follow-up period followed at the end of Part C or at the end of Parts A or B for participants 
who did not enter Part C.  
Part A and Part B were carried out as 2 separate sequential independent parts and participants could 
only be enrolled in either Part A or Part B. Part A evaluated efficacy and safety of dupilumab 300 mg 
QW versus placebo. Part B evaluated efficacy and safety of dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W 
versus placebo. Participants were stratified by age (≥18 years versus ≥12 to <18 years of age) and

use of PPI at randomization. The choice of placebo as a control was appropriate for the objective of this 
study as it provided the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab. 
Part C of Study R668-EE-1774 extended the treatment period for an additional 28 weeks. All 
participants who entered Part C from Part A were administered dupilumab 300 mg SC QW for 28 weeks 
during Part C.   Participants who received dupilumab during Part B received the same dupilumab dose 
regimen in Part C (300 mg QW or Q2W) and participants who received placebo were re-randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in Part C. The design for the 
extension period (Part C) allowed characterization of the efficacy and safety profile over a longer 
period. Rescue treatment with systemic and swallowed topical corticosteroids or emergency 
esophageal dilation was allowed. 
The key eligibility criteria of study R668-EE-1774 Part A and Part B were similar. The study population 
consisted of adult males and females ≥18 years of age and adolescent males and females ≥12 to <18 
years of age at the time of study entry with documented diagnosis of EoE by endoscopic biopsy that 
was not responsive to at least 8 weeks of treatment with high-dose PPI. All participants were required 
to have an endoscopy with biopsies at the baseline visit, which demonstrated ≥15 intraepithelial 
eos/hpf in at least 2 of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, mid, and distal).  
A total of 81 participants met the eligibility criteria in Part A and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio with 
39 participants in the placebo group and 42 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group.  
The majority of participants were male (60.5%) and most participants were white (96.3%). The mean 
age of participants was 31.5 years with 24.7% of participants ≥12 to <18 years of age, 43.2% of 
participants ≥18 to <40 years of age and 32.1% of participants ≥40 to <65 years. Baseline disease 
characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups and indicated a highly 
symptomatic population, with most participants having previously used swallowed topical 
corticosteroids for the treatment of EoE (74.1%) and almost half of participants having prior 
esophageal dilations (43.2%). The mean peak eosinophil count of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, 
mid, and distal) at baseline was 89.3 eos/hpf. The mean DSQ score at baseline was 33.6, indicating 
multiple days of dysphagia every 2 weeks (14 days). 
A total of 20 participants were adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age). 11 adolescents were 
randomized to the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 9 to the placebo group. The mean age of the adolescent 
subgroup was 14.9 years. The majority were male (80.0%) and most participants were white (90.0%). 
The mean weight and BMI of adolescent participants was 58.9 kg and 20.8 kg/m2, respectively with 
35.0% ≥60 kg. Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment 
groups. The majority had previously used STCs for EoE (85.0%) and 10.0% had prior esophageal 
dilations with a mean of 2.5 previous dilations.  
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups in 
Part A. All randomized participants received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A and 96.3% 
completed Part A study drug. Three participants (3.7%) discontinued study drug during Part A.  
In Part B, 240 participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 3 treatment groups: 80 
participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 81 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group 
and 79 participants in the placebo group.  
The majority of participants were male (63.8%) and most participants were White (90.4%). The mean 
age of participants was 28.1 years with 32.9% of participants ≥12 to <18 years of age, 46.3% of 
participants ≥18 to <40 years of age, and 20.0% of participants ≥40 to <65 years. Two participants 
(0.8%) were ≥65 years of age. The mean weight of participants was 76.2 kg with 77.1% of 
participants ≥60 kg. 35.4% of participants had prior esophageal dilations and 72.5% of participants 
were receiving PPIs at the time of randomization. Most participants (73.2%) used prior swallowed

topical corticosteroids. Treatment with STCs was deemed not effective in 43.1%, with 59.8% reporting 
recurrence of EoE symptoms within 3 months. At baseline, participants had a mean esophageal peak 
eosinophil counts of 87.1 eos/hpf and elevated mean scores for the DSQ of 36.7 points.  
A total of 79 (32.9%) participants were adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age). 26 adolescents were 
enrolled in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 27 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 26 in the 
placebo group. The majority of adolescent participants were male (72.2%) and most were white 
(81.0%). The mean age of adolescent participants was 15.0 years. The mean weight of adolescent 
participants was 64.3 kg with 53.2% ≥60 kg. The majority had previously used STCs for the treatment 
of EoE (72.2%) and 6.3% had prior esophageal dilations with a mean of 2.8 previous dilations. Only 
25.3% reported STCs as being effective for EoE. About half of adolescent participants (51.9%) had a 
history of an inadequate response, intolerance, and /or contraindication to prior STCs.  
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups in 
Part B and consistent with the Part A study population and published literature for an EoE population 
with a significant disease burden. Twelve participants (5 placebo, 5 dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 2 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W) discontinued the study through week 24 and another participant in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group discontinued from the study after completing week 24 but discontinued 
during the Part B follow-up period. 
A total of 77 participants from Part A entered Part C (Part A/C), 40 from the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group and 37 from the placebo group. All participants received dupilumab 300 mg QW for 28 weeks 
during Part C. At the start of Part C, demographic characteristics for participants from Part A were 
consistent with that for participants from the Part A FAS. The majority of participants were male 
(61.0%) and most participants were white (96.1%). The mean age of participants at study entry was 
31.8 years with 24.1% of participants ≥12 to <18 years of age, 41.6% of participants ≥18 to <40 
years of age, and 33.8% of participants ≥40 to <65 years of age. The mean peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count at baseline of Part C was 66.7 eos/hpf in the placebo/dupilumab 300 
mg QW group and 12.3 eos/hpf in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. At the 
start of Part C, the mean DSQ total score was 24.7 in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 
10.4 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
Of the 240 participants from Part B, 227 entered Part C (Part B/C). Participants, who received 
placebo during the double-blind treatment period of Part B were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. All other Part B participants remained on the same 
dupilumab dose regimen upon entering Part C. Of the 227 participants, 111 participants received 
dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part C (37 received placebo and 74 received dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part 
B) and 116 participants received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in Part C (37 received placebo and 79 
received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in Part B). Of the 79 adolescent participants enrolled in Part B, 75 
adolescents entered Part C (26/27 from the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 24/26 from the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group and 25/26 from the Part B placebo group).  
Study R668-EE-1774 was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several changes were 
implemented via amendment to protect patient safety and data integrity by allowing for certain study 
procedures to occur at delayed time points and/or outside of the clinic environment. The protocol 
amendments are considered adequate due to the restrictions during the pandemic and not to have 
affected the efficacy results. 
A high number of protocol deviations have also been reported for all parts of the study with the most 
frequently reported important protocol deviation in the category of procedure not performed. The most 
frequently reported procedure not performed was DSQ e-diary not completed by participants >6 times 
in a 14-day period. Considering the high percentage of this protocol deviation observed during the 
study, this was further evaluated by the MAH to determine whether there would be any impact on the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 103/179 
 
 
 
 
 
DSQ primary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different DSQ scoring algorithms to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis. Results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent 
with the primary analysis. In conclusion, the CHMP agreed with the MAH that the deviations did not 
have an impact on study objectives, nor efficacy results or interpretation of study results. 
No subjects weighting less than 40kg were included in study R668-EE-1774, therefore from an efficacy 
perspective, the evidence base for inclusion of patients weighting less than 40kg in the initially 
proposed indication was considered very limited. The MAH revised the indication during the procedure 
to exclude patients weighting less than 40kg to adequately reflect the studied population. In addition, 
the MAH updated section 4.2 to mention that Dupilumab has not been studied in patients weighting 
less than 40kg as requested by CHMP. 
The co-primary endpoint in Part A and B were Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal 
Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 and Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ 
Total Score at week 24. Part C had no primary endpoint, but the peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf and Absolute change in DSQ score from baseline to week 52 were part 
of the key secondary endpoints. 
The esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count is a diagnostic criterion for EoE. DSQ is a well-defined, 
valid and reliable PRO measure, that has been developed and tested in both adults and adolescents 
with EoE. Therefore, the endpoints are considered adequate to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in 
patients with EoE. 
The key secondary endpoints for Part A and B included Absolute change in EoE-EREFS from baseline to 
week 24, Percent change in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count (eos/hpf) from baseline to 
week 24, Absolute change in EoE Grade and Stage Score from the EoEHSS from baseline to week 24. 
Further secondary endpoints were Percent change in DSQ from baseline to week 24, NES for the 
relative change from baseline to week 24 in the EDP transcriptome signature, NES for the relative 
change from baseline to week 24 in the type 2 inflammation transcriptome signature, Absolute change 
from baseline to week 24 in health-related QOL as measured by EoE-IQ. For Part B, Absolute change 
from baseline to week 24 in severity and/or frequency of EoE symptoms other than dysphagia was also 
evaluated.  
Study R668-EE-1324 was submitted as supportive data. This study was a phase 2 proof of concept, 
multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of dupilumab in adult participants with EoE. The participants were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg QW with a 600 mg loading dose or placebo 
during a 12-week treatment phase. Rescue treatment with systemic and swallowed topical 
corticosteroids or emergency esophageal dilation was allowed. Participants who met the eligibility 
criteria underwent day 1 baseline assessments and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
dupilumab 300 mg QW or placebo. After the 12-week double-blind treatment phase, participants were 
followed for an additional 16 weeks.  
A total of 47 participants were enrolled, 23 participants were randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg 
QW, and 24 participants were randomized to receive placebo. Overall, the study design is considered 
appropriate.. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In Part A the proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count 
≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was significantly greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (59.55%) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 104/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to the placebo group (5.1%). The reduction [i.e., improvement] from baseline in DSQ total 
score at week 24 was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-21.92 points) versus the placebo 
group (-9.60 points). 
The results of the secondary endpoints evaluated show consistent improvement of EoE disease 
symptoms and health-related quality-of-life measures consistent with results of the primary endpoints. 
Consistent beneficial effects across this multiple histologic, endoscopic and patient-reported outcome 
measures of disease activity were seen, demonstrating efficacy for dupilumab 300 mg QW for 
treatment of patients with EoE in Part A. 
In Part B, Dupilumab 300 mg QW demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement over placebo in the 
co-primary endpoints. The proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (58.8%) 
compared to placebo (6.3%). Higher improvement from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 was 
seen in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (−23.78 points) compared to placebo (−13.86 points). 
Sensitivity analyses, using different imputation methods, showed similar results as the primary 
analysis and confirmed that regardless of the assumptions used for missing data, treatment with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW produced a greater clinical effect size in comparison with placebo. 
The results of the high number of secondary endpoints also show greater improvement of EoE disease 
symptoms and health-related quality-of-life measures with Dupilumab 300 mg QW compared to 
placebo.  
In contrast, the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen significantly reduced esophageal eosinophil 
counts ≤6 eos/hpf (60.5%) without meaningful effects on dysphagia (as measured by the absolute 
change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24) or other EoE disease symptoms (as measured by 
the absolute change from baseline in EoE-SQ score at week 24). 
The proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 
eos/hpf at week 24 was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (60.5%) than in 300 mg QW group 
(58.8%) and the placebo group (6.3%). However, the improvement in DSQ total score at week 24 was 
with −14.37 points in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group only similar to placebo −13.86 points. 
Supplemental and post-hoc analyses performed to further evaluate the difference between the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W regimens with respect to the DSQ endpoint supported the primary 
analysis. The difference between the QW and Q2W regimens could not be explained by an imbalance of 
responses to the DSQ questions that contributed to the calculation of the DSQ total score. The results 
from the secondary endpoints were consistent with the results from co-primary endpoints and showed 
no improvement with the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen in EoE disease symptoms or health-
related quality-of-life measures compared with placebo although the magnitude of improvements in all 
other secondary histologic, endoscopic and molecular endpoints of EoE were similar to the ones 
observed with the dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen. The reason for the different results for the 
co-primary endpoint between the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W regimens remains unclear. 
At the CHMP request, the MAH discussed the difference in results. One hypothesis is that in addition to 
the effect on infiltration of eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa, the drug effect on dysphagia may be 
modulated by a different effect compartment (e.g., muscularis layer, esophageal nervous plexus). 
Although dupilumab 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen did improve histologic outcomes, it did not achieve 
the same level of improvements in dysphagia as dupilumab 300 mg QW at Week 24 and 52. This is 
indicating that dupilumab 300 mg QW is the appropriate regimen to achieve continuous improvement 
and thus recommended in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
At the end of Part A/C treatment period, more than half (57.8%) of participants achieved a peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf. Of participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg QW in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Part A and C, 68.4% had histological remission at the Part C baseline (end of Part A [week 24]) and 
55.9% at week 52 (end of Part C). Of participants previously treated with placebo in Part A, 60.0% 
achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf after 28 weeks of dupilumab 
treatment in Part C (week 52), which is similar to the proportion of participants treated with dupilumab 
during Part A. 
Dupilumab also reduced dysphagia, as demonstrated by an overall 71.48% reduction from study 
baseline (start of Part A) to week 52 in DSQ total score. Participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group maintained their improvement in DSQ total score observed in Part A with continued dupilumab 
treatment up to week 52 in Part C. The mean percent reduction from the Part A baseline was 70.06% 
at week 24 (Part C baseline) and 75.93% at week 52 (after 28 weeks of dupilumab). Participants in 
the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group showed improvement in the DSQ score, the mean percent 
reduction from the Part A baseline in DSQ total score was 31.23% at week 24 (Part C baseline) 
compared with a 65.87% reduction at week 52 (after 28 weeks of dupilumab). The improvement in 
DSQ total score in this group at week 52 was similar to the improvement noted at the Part C baseline 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. Several other secondary endpoints 
evaluated show consistent results in reduction of disease symptoms. 
In Part B/C, numerically greater effects in all endpoints were observed in participants treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW for 52 weeks compared with those treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. 
Furthermore, efficacy continued to improve during Part C. In Part B, 58.8% of participants had 
achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf at Week 24, while 84.6% had 
achieved this after 52 weeks. Similarly, DSQ scores continued to improve participants treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/ dupilumab 300 mg QW group from -23.78 at Week 24 to -30.26 at Week 52. 
Participants who received placebo in Part B achieved improvements after 28 weeks on dupilumab 300 
mg QW in Part C similar to those observed for participants who received 24 weeks of dupilumab 
treatment during Part B. 
In summary, Part C efficacy data for up to one year provide further evidence that treatment with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW shows clinically meaningful efficacy in the treatment of EoE patients. The 
results of the study have been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Pooling of data for Part A and Part B were performed to ensure an adequate sample size for subgroup 
analyses of efficacy for the co-primary efficacy endpoints (Pool 1). Pool 1 was used for analyses of the 
additional clinico-pathologic remission endpoint and for efficacy subgroup analyses of the histologic 
remission and clinical symptoms endpoints. The results in the pooled analyses showed greater 
proportion of dupilumab-treated participants achieved clinico-pathologic remission compared to 
placebo-treated participants in Part A, Part B and the Pool 1 population. The results were consistent 
between Parts A and B and Pool 1, with a significant difference observed (p<0.0001) compared to 
placebo. 
Dupilumab 300 mg QW demonstrated a consistent effect on the proportion of participants in both Part 
A and Part B of R668-EE-1774 who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 
eos/hpf at week 24 and absolute change in DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 compared to 
placebo across all subgroups assessed, including in particular age, gender, history of atopic dermatitis, 
history of asthma, history of food allergy, and previous use of STC for EoE. 
Although it can be agreed that the data from B/C indicate that continued use for up to one year was 
generally well tolerated it remains unclear whether a frequency of weekly dosing is required after a 
patient achieves remission, or after one year of therapy. The weekly dosing is a considerable disease 
burden, which might not be tolerated by all patients for long term use. As no data beyond week 52 are

available, at the CHMP request, the MAH included a statement in section 4.2 of the SmPC that ‘Dosing 
beyond 52 weeks has not been studied’ to address this concern 
The primary endpoint of supportive study R668-EE-1324 was the absolute change in SDI total score 
from baseline to week 10. The results show a higher reduction in the SDI total score of -3.0 in the 
dupilumab group compared to -1.3 in the placebo group, which indicates a clinical meaningful 
improvement. The results of the high number of secondary endpoints evaluated are consistent with the 
results of the primary endpoint indicating an improvement in signs and symptoms of patients with EoE. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
In Part A, 20 adolescent participants (12 to <18 years of age) were randomized. 11 adolescents 
received dupilumab 300 mg QW and 9 received placebo. The study was not powered for any of the 
subgroups. The results show that a higher proportion of adolescent participants achieved a peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(04/11, 36.4%) group than in the placebo group (0/9, 0%). However, the proportion of patients is 
lower than in the Dupilumab 300 mg QW group in Part B and in adult participants treated with 
dupilumab. The improvement from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 were also greater in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW (−23.48) group than in the placebo group (−15.93). 
In Part B, 79 (32.9%) adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age) were randomized: 26 participants in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 27 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 26 
participants in the placebo group. The proportion of adolescents who achieved a peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was greater in both the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(15/26, 57.7%) and 300 mg Q2W (13/27, 48.1%) groups than in the placebo group (2/26, 7.7%). The 
improvements in the dupilumab groups followed a similar pattern to those in adult participants. In the 
improvement from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 the reduction in DSQ score was greater in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW (−19.54) group than in the placebo group (−16.42). However, less 
improvement compared to placebo was seen in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (−12.14). 
In Part A/C, 3 of 9 (33.3%) adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group and 6 of 8 (75.0%) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 52. Two adolescent participants in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group achieved a peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at baseline of Part C but were no longer responders at week 52. 
Adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group maintained 
improvement in DSQ total score with continued treatment during Part C. The mean change from the 
Part A baseline (36.21) was -24.80 points at the Part C baseline (week 24; N=10) and −25.57 points 
at week 52 (N=6). Adolescent participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group who started 
dupilumab treatment in Part C showed progressive improvement. The mean change from the Part A 
baseline (36.04) was -25.45 points at week 52 (N=5). 
The results of Part C show that adolescent participants in the dupilumab/dupilumab group had a 
decrease in Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count ≤6 
eos/hpf from 55.6% at the end of Part A to 33.3% at week 52. In contrast the improvement in DSQ 
score was -3.97 from the end of Part A. 
The results from Part B/C for adolescent participants entering from Part B, submitted at the CHMP 
request, showed further improvements especially in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. Continued 
improvement was seen from 66.7% at baseline (Week 24) to 81.8% of the adolescent participants in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW achieving histological remission at Week 52. The 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group also demonstrated improvement from 53.8% 
at baseline (Week 24) to 60.0% of participants achieving histological remission in all 3 regions at Week 
52. 
Higher reductions in DSQ were also seen in the dupilumab 300 mg QW groups (-25.02 in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and -26.86 in dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group) 
compared to the 300 mg Q2W group and to baseline, indicating higher continued improvement for the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen. Although, improvements were also seen in the 300 mg Q2W 
groups, the results are of lesser extent. 
Overall the 300 mg QW dosing regimen showed higher efficacy in achieving histological remission and 
the reduction of dysphagia burden in the adolescent participants. Therefore, this is the proposed 
dosing regimen for adolescents weighting more than 40 kgs. No data are available for paediatric 
patients weighting less than 40 kgs. 
In Pool 1, the Co-Primary endpoints were analysed by age. The results show that in the ≥12 to <18 
years of age group, the proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial 
eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was 19/37 (51.4%) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
versus 2/35 (5.7%) in the placebo group. In the ≥12 to <18 years of age group, the improvement in 
DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 was -21.07 points in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
(n=37) and -17.23 points in the placebo group (n=35). 
When compared to the ≥18 years of age subgroup, the improvement from baseline in DSQ total score 
at week 24 relative to placebo in the adolescent subgroup was smaller. The MAH claims that this is 
likely due to higher placebo effect, which is acknowledged. However, at the end of part B, the results 
for the dupilumab treated adolescents are lower than in adults with −19.54 in DSQ score compared to 
adults with -26.68. Of note, the results in Part A show a higher improvement from baseline in DSQ 
total score at week 24 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW of −23.48 than in Part B.  
Results from Part C (28-week) for the participants who originally participated in Part B (24-week) of 
the study support the long-term efficacy of dupilumab 300 mg QW in adolescent participants with EoE.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study design of the Phase 3 Study R668-EE-1774 with Part A and Part B carried out as 2 separate 
sequential independent parts was adequate. Therefore, this study is considered acceptable as pivotal 
study. 
In adult and adolescent participants Dupilumab 300 mg QW showed clinical meaningful improvements 
of signs and symptoms of active EoE and with substantial disease burden in Part A and B of study 
R668-EE-1774. Results from Part C of this study showed that the improvements in signs and 
symptoms of EoE were maintained or even further improved with long-term treatment through week 
52. In addition, participants who switched from placebo to dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part C showed 
similar improvement as participant treated with dupilumab in the previous study parts.  
In contrast, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W did not show improvements in clinical symptoms or health-related 
QoL compared with placebo, even though the magnitude of improvements in all histologic, endoscopic, 
and molecular endpoints of EoE were similar to those observed with the dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing 
regimen. The dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen is therefore considered to be the appropriate 
dosing regimen to have meaningful benefit for adult and adolescent patients with EoE weighting more 
than 40 kgs.

EMA/6467/2023

Since no clinical experience was available for patients weighting less than 40kg, initially proposed to be 
included  in  the  therapeutic  indication,  the  MAH  revised  their  claim  during  the  procedure  to  exclude 
patients weighting less than 40kg from the indication.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the efficacy data available supports the following indication: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents 12 years 
and older, weighing at least 40 kg, who are inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to, or who are 
not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy (see section 5.1). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The assessment of safety was a secondary objective in both the pivotal study R668-EE-1774 and the 
supportive study R668-EE-1324 and included an evaluation of the safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of dupilumab treatment for up to 52 weeks in adult and adolescent patients with EoE 
(in study R668-EE-1774) and in adult patients with EoE (in study R668-EE-1324).  
Safety was similarly assessed in the individual studies by collecting information on TEAEs, treatment-
emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation or death and 
AESIs. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as AEs that developed or worsened in 
severity compared to the baseline during the treatment-emergent period. Treatment-emergent 
abnormal laboratory values (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical findings, 
and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were also evaluated. 
For all ongoing studies in the dupilumab clinical program, suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) were reported up to a cut-off date of 28 Sept 2021 in the atopic dermatitis (AD) 
paediatric 6 months to 5 years old application (EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0060). SUSARs from ongoing 
studies reported from 28 Sept 2021 to a new cut-off of 20 Dec 2021 were provided in the Prurigo 
Nodularis application  (EMEA/H/C/004390/II/0063).

The integrated analysis of safety is based on 2 pools (Pool 2a and Pool 2b see ancillary analyses). 
Integrated analyses from the phase 3, 24-week treatment periods (Pool 2a), and from the phase 2 
(12-week treatment period) and phase 3 (24-week treatment period) studies (Pool 2b), are presented 
to evaluate the safety of dupilumab in patients with EoE. Supportive long-term safety data (52 weeks’ 
exposure in the participants randomized to dupilumab in Part A) are presented from Part A/C results of 
study R668-EE-1774. 
In addition, Pool 3 was specified to determine the overall extent of treatment exposure of patients with 
EoE in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, including the extended active treatment period (Part A/C).

Table 40 Numbers of Participants in the Integrated Databases for Safety and Exposure Pools 
Patient exposure 
The EoE patient safety database contains exposure data from 367 participants who were exposed to 
study medication during the 2 placebo-controlled studies (studies R668-EE-1324 and R668-EE-
1774) and including the extended active treatment period from study R668-EE-1774 Part A/C. 
104 participants received only placebo (78 from study R668-EE-1774 Part B, 2 from Part A who did not 
continue to Part C and 24 from study R668-EE-1324). 263 received dupilumab (all participants who 
were originally randomized to dupilumab in study R668-EE-1774 Parts A and B and in study R668-EE-
1324 and those participants originally randomized to placebo in Part A who continued to Part C and 
received dupilumab). Of these 46 participants were adolescents, of which 10 participants received 
dupilumab 300 mg QW over a period of about 1 year (Part A/C).  
Of note, Dupilumab 300 mg QW has not been studied in adolescents outside of study R668-EE-1774 
therefore no supportive data for the 300mg QW dose from adolescents is available from other 
indications as it has never been administered to adolescents outside of the pivotal study. PK data from 
Parts A and B show that adolescents with EoE had approximately 25% higher functional dupilumab 
levels than adults with EoE at the proposed dose of dupilumab 300mg QW.

Group in Adult and Adolescent Participants with Eosinophilic Esophagitis Receiving Dupilumab 
300mg QW (Study R668-EE-1774 Parts A and B, PKAS) 
Adolescent data from other dupilumab indications was studied with lower doses, 200mg-300mg every 
2 weeks. The highest exposures in adolescents were achieved for 3 participants on 4 mg/kg QW in the 
open-label extension Study R668-AD-1434. However, adult participants with AD (R668-AD-1334, 
R668-AD-1416, R668-AD-1224, and R668-AD-1117) or asthma (ACT11457) assigned to dupilumab 
300 mg QW regimens have included participants with a baseline body weight as low as 42 kg. Previous 
population PK analyses including adolescents with AD or asthma indicate that weight was a primary 
factor accounting for variability in dupilumab exposure and that age was not a significant covariate 
after accounting for weight in adults and adolescents. As dupilumab 300 mg QW has not been studied 
in lighter body weight patients with EoE, participants with body weight <40 kg were excluded from 
R668-EE-1774. 
With the responses to the Request for Supplementary Information the MAH submitted additional safety 
data from 75 adolescent participants who entered Part C from Part B up to Week 52.

Table 42 Number of Participants with Eosinophilic Esophagitis Included in the Summary of Clinical 
Safety by Study (SAF) 
➢  Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set (SAF) for the integrated analysis included all participants who received at least 
1 dose of study drug. Participants were analysed according to the treatment group determined in the 
individual studies. 
The analysis periods for the pooled analyses were as follows: 
• 
For Pool 2a: the analysis period is the “24-week treatment period” from study R668-EE-1774 
Part A and Part B corresponding to that defined in the Part A and Part B SAPs: 
- 
For participants who entered Part C: from day 1 to the date of first dose of Part C study drug 
(or week 24 visit if participant entered Part C but never received any Part C study drug) 
- 
For participants who did not enter Part C but completed the week 24 visit with known visit 
date: from day 1 to the week 24 visit 
- 
For participants who did not enter Part C and did not complete the week 24 visit, or had a 
missing week 24 visit date: from day 1 to study day 169 (i.e., 24 weeks ×7 days/week) or 
to participant’s last study participation date, whichever was earlier. Note: For participants in 
this category who received extended dosing in the placebo-controlled period due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the 24-week treatment period ended on their last study participation 
date. 
• 
For Pool 2b: the analysis period is the “24-week treatment period” from R668-EE-1774 Part A 
and Part B as defined above and the R668-EE-1324 “12-week treatment period” corresponding 
to that defined in its SAP, i.e., day 1 from start of administration of the first dose of study drug

through week 12 of the double-blind period (85 days starting from the first dose of study drug if 
the date of the week-12 treatment visit was unavailable).

The most frequently reported TEAEs in Part A were in the System organ class (SOC) General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions with 15 participants (38.5%) in the placebo group and 17 
participants (40.5%) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and were mostly driven by injection site 
reactions.  
The proportion of participants with TEAEs in the SOC Infections and Infestations was higher in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group (15 participants [35.7%]) than the placebo group (10 participants 
[25.6%]) with the difference being predominantly driven by Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (9.5% 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 0% in the placebo group). The Preferred term (PT) 
Nasopharyngitis showed a similar incidence (11.9% in in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 10.3% 
in the placebo group).  
A higher frequency of Gastrointestinal Disorders was reported in the placebo group (30.8%) compared 
to the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (19.0%) with the most frequent PT being Nausea (7.7% in the 
placebo group and 2.4% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group).  
Also, a higher proportion of participants in the placebo group (20.5%) reported TEAEs in the SOC 
Nervous System Disorders than the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (14.3%) with the only frequent PT 
being Headache (4.8% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 10.3% in the placebo group). 
PTs that occurred with a higher frequency in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (≥5% higher) than the 
placebo group were: Injection Site Reaction, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, and Rhinorrhoea. All 
injection site reactions were assessed as mild or moderate in intensity. There were no severe or 
serious injection site reactions. 
PTs that occurred with a higher frequency in the placebo group (≥5%) than in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group were: Injection Site Erythema, Nausea, Dysphagia, Headache, Blood Creatine 
Phosphokinase Increased, Dermatitis Atopic, Oropharyngeal Pain, and Rash.

The proportion of participants with TEAEs in the SOC General disorders and administration site 
conditions was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (56.8%) group than in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW (42.5%) and placebo groups (39.7%), and mostly driven by injection site reactions of erythema, 
pain, and bruising. 
In the Infections and infestations SOC, the incidence of TEAEs was numerically higher in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group (30.0%) and the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (32.1%) than in the placebo group 
(23.1%). The pattern of TEAEs within the Infections and infestations SOC was closely examined to 
determine if there was an association of TEAEs of infections with dupilumab use.

Upon examination of individual PTs, the incidence of Nasopharyngitis and Upper respiratory tract 
infection was found to be similar across the treatment groups. Sinusitis was only reported in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, by 5.0% of participants, and Acute sinusitis only in the dupilumab 300 
mg Q2W group, in 2.5% of participants. All TEAEs of Sinusitis and Acute sinusitis were non-serious, of 
mild to moderate intensity and all were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug and 
all resolved. It should be noted that one TEAE each of Allergic sinusitis and Sinus congestion in the 
placebo group was reported in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC (under the HLT 
Paranasal sinus disorders). The incidence of TEAEs under the SOC Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders was higher in the placebo group (17.9%) than in the dupilumab combined group 
(11.8%), with the most frequently reported HLT being Upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, 
which also had a higher incidence in the placebo group (7.7%) versus the dupilumab combined group 
(5.6%).  
The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination rates were similar across the 
treatment groups. 9 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 8 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group and 11 in the placebo group received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccination during the study. 
No participant was vaccinated prior to study baseline. There was a higher incidence of TEAEs with a PT 
of COVID-19 in the dupilumab groups (5.0% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 6.2% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group) than in the placebo group (0.0%). These TEAEs all occurred between 
16 Mar 2020 and 08 Apr 2021. Eight of the participants were in the US and 1 was in Belgium. The 
majority of COVID-19 infections were in adults (7 of the 9 cases), were mild in intensity, all were 
assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator and all resolved. One participant had 
received the first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose 4 days before the COVID-19 TEAE started. All other 
participants were not vaccinated. 
The majority of the events of COVID-19 infection in the dupilumab arm were reported as mild to 
moderate. There was 1 TEAE of COVID-19 reported as severe in intensity in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group in a 12-year-old White female. The TEAE started on study day 1 and resolved on study day 19. 
None of the events of COVID-19 infection were serious TEAEs or required hospitalization or 
supplemental oxygen therapy and study drug was continued in all cases.  
Review of the reporting rate of COVID-19 infection during dupilumab use, calculated using global post-
marketing (PM) pharmacovigilance (PV) data, indicated no increased occurrence of COVID-19 infection 
when compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the 6 countries (US, Colombia, Brazil, UK, UAE, 
and Canada) which contributed >1% of all cases to the Sanofi PM PV database. The current review of 
the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) 2021 Q2 database shows the lower bound of the 
90% confidence interval of empirical Bayesian geometric mean (EB05) <2 for COVID-19 MedDRA 
standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) and COVID-19 related PTs. Thus, no signal of unbalanced reporting 
has been observed from FAERS.

To date, the data for dupilumab suggest that blockade of the IL-4Rα provides specific targeted 
suppression of type 2 inflammation with no discernible impact on suppressing immune responses to 
viral and bacterial pathogens. There is no evidence that dupilumab interferes with the induction of IgG 
antibodies following vaccination, nor the persistence of IgG isotypes. Dupilumab has not been shown 
to increase the risk of viral infections in the clinical program except in AD for recurrence of local oral 
Herpes simplex infections. Dupilumab also did not impact T-cell dependent and independent humoral 
responses to tetanus and meningococcal vaccines. 
The totality of the data from the dupilumab clinical trial program and post-marketing data, as well as 
the published literature, shows no evidence of an increased incidence of opportunistic or serious 
infections with dupilumab. 
For Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, all of the most common PTs (i.e., ≥5% in any treatment group) 
had a higher incidence in the placebo group versus the 2 dupilumab groups, with the largest 
differences seen for Diarrhoea, Dyspepsia, and Nausea. For the SOCs Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, Nervous system disorders, and Vascular disorders there were similar proportions 
of participants with TEAEs in the respective SOC across the treatment groups. 
The most frequent TEAE reported in each treatment group was Injection site reaction (approximately 
20% across all 3 treatment groups). For the TEAE Injection site erythema, in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W group, 1 event was of moderate intensity, all others were mild and all resolved. For the TEAEs of 
Injection site pain, Injection site swelling, and Injection site bruising all events in the dupilumab 300 
mg Q2W group were mild and resolved without drug therapy. 
Table 49 Overall Summary of Number of Adolescent Participants with TEAEs During the Part B 24-
week Treatment Period (Part B SAF) 
The incidence of all TEAEs in adolescents was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg groups (QW: 92.3%; 
Q2W: 85.2%) than in the placebo group (73.1%). The number of drug related TEAEs were lower in the 
300 mg QW group (34.6%) compared to the placebo (57.7%) and the 300 mg Q2W (59.3%) groups. 
Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity.

There were 4 adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (Depression suicidal, 
Campylobacter colitis, Blood creatine phosphokinase abnormal, and Pneumonia aspiration) and 1 
adolescent participant in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (Suicidal ideation) who reported a 
treatment-emergent SAE. All SAEs were assessed by the investigators as unrelated to study drug. Two 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study drug were reported by 1 adolescent 
participant in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (Congenital coronary artery malformation and 
Dyspnoea).

In the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 73.0% of participants experienced a TEAE, and 40.5% 
experienced a drug-related TEAE. The corresponding proportions in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group were 60.0% and 20.0%. The difference was largely due to a higher 
incidence of injection site reactions and related TEAEs in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
compared to the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
The General disorders and administration site conditions SOC had the highest proportion of 
participants with TEAEs (24 participants, 31.2%). 15 participants (40.5%) were in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 9 participants (22.5%) in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. The results were mainly driven by TEAEs of injection site reactions. 
The proportion of participants with TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was 22.1% (17 
participants) with 9 participants (24.3%) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 8 
participants (20.0%) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. In the Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC the proportion of participants with TEAEs was 14.3% (11 
participants).  
In the 50 participants who entered the post-treatment follow-up period after participating in Part C of 
the study, 9 (18.0%) experienced TEAEs. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. 
The most frequently reported PTs (in ≥5% of participants overall) during Part C were: Injection site 
reaction (15.6%), Injection site erythema (11.7%), Injection site pain (6.5%), Headache (6.5%), 
Nasopharyngitis (5.2%), Acne (5.2%), and Insomnia (5.2%). The proportion of participants with 
TEAEs in the Nervous system disorders and Psychiatric disorders SOC were 10.4% (8 participants) and 
9.1% (7 participants), respectively.

In the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 7 (77.8%) adolescent participants experienced a TEAE 
and 2 (22.2%) experienced a drug-related TEAE. The corresponding numbers and proportions in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group were 8 (80.0%) and 4 (40.0%). The most 
frequently reported PTs (in ≥2 adolescent participants in either treatment group) during Part C were: 
Acne (4 participants; 44.4%) and Injection site reaction (2 participants; 22.2%) in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and Injection site reaction (3 participants; 30.0%), and 
Injection site swelling, Foot fracture and Headache (all in 2 participants; 20.0%) in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group.  
➢  Participants from Part B 
The MAH submitted additional safety data from participants who entered Part C from Part B. 
Table 53 Overall Summary of Number of Adult Participants with TEAEs During Part B/C 28-week 
Treatment Period (Part C Safety Analysis Set - Participants from Part B) 
During the 28-week treatment period in Part C (for participants enrolling from Part B), the majority of 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The proportion of participants who experienced a TEAE 
across the treatment groups ranged from 59.5% in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group to 
70.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. The proportions of participants 
experiencing a drug-related TEAE were higher in participants who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in 
Part B/C, regardless of the previous Part B treatment (32.4% in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group and 31.6% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 18.9% in both 
treatment groups for participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part B/C [i.e., in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW groups]).

The most commonly affected system organ class (SOC) was General disorders and administration site 
conditions. Overall, the proportion of participants with TEAEs in this SOC was 30.3% (46/152 adult 
participants).

No deaths were reported during Part C. The number of participants reporting treatment-emergent 
SAEs was low (2.2%) and no SAE was reported by more than 1 participant. The number of participants 
reporting a TEAE leading to permanent dose withdrawal was low (0.9%) with no PT reported by more 
than 1 participant.  
One participant in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (0.4%) reported 3 events of (PT) 
“Anaphylactic reaction”. This participant had a history of multiple food allergies (seafood, milk, egg, 
peanuts/tree nuts, wheat, and banana). The events occurred after eating salmon, wheat and tahini 
and were reported as not related to the study drug by the Investigator, action taken with study drug 
reported as dose not changed, and outcome reported as recovered/resolved. There were no events 
reported under (HLT) “Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid responses” for the QW dose groups. 
During the Part B/C treatment period, 7.9% of the participants had a TEAE of COVID-19. All were non-
serious, and the majority were mild/moderate in intensity. One event of severe intensity was reported. 
None of the TEAEs of COVID-19 led to discontinuation of study drug and all events resolved. The event 
of severe intensity, 3 events of moderate intensity and 1 event of mild intensity led to temporary 
interruption of study drug. All TEAEs of COVID-19 were assessed as not related to study drug by the 
investigator. The event of severe intensity occurred in a 14-year-old female participant in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. The COVID-19 events were reported from 22 
October 2020 to 23 January 2022, an exposure period occurring during a global pandemic involving 
the highly infectious DELTA and later OMICRON variants of COVID-19. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (in ≥5% of participants overall) were Injection site reaction (ISR), 
Injection site pain, Injection site erythema and COVID-19. None of the ISRs led to treatment 
discontinuation. The frequency of ISRs (at HLT level) was either similar or lower for QW dosing as 
compared to Q2W during the 28-week of Part B/C and was lower than the 24-week treatment period of 
Part B combined dupilumab arm (46.0%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (37.5%). This indicates that the 
incidence of ISRs is not increasing with continued dosing over 52 weeks. 
Safety in the Adolescent Participants in Study Part B/C at Week 52: 
Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 70.7% of adolescent 
participants during the treatment period in Part B/C. This was similar to the adult population where 
TEAEs were reported in 65.1% of adult participants during the treatment period in Part B/C. The 
proportion of adolescent participants who experienced a TEAE was similar across the treatment groups, 
ranging from 69.2% (18/26) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 70.0% 
(7/10) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 70.8% (17/24) in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, to 73.3% (11/15) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group.

Table 55 Overall Summary of Number of Adolescent Participants with TEAEs During Part B/C 28-
week Treatment Period (Part C Safety Analysis Set - Participants from Part B) 
The majority of TEAEs in both adolescents and adults were mild in intensity. The most commonly 
affected system organ class (SOC) in both adolescents and adults was General disorders and 
administration site conditions. Overall, the proportion of adolescent participants with TEAEs in this SOC 
was 33.3% (25/75 adolescent participants). The number of adolescent participants with TEAEs in this 
SOC were similar across the treatment groups, except for the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
which had the lowest incidence (20.0%). This SOC incidence in adolescent participants was mostly 
driven by various injection site reaction preferred terms (PTs) including injection site reaction (17.3%), 
injection site pain (10.7%), injection site erythema (5.3%) and injection site swelling (5.3%). Further 
SOCs were Infections and infestations (29.3%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (26.7%). In both SOCs, 
no individual PTs were identified driving the incidences. Common TEAEs in the Infections and 
infestations SOC reported were COVID-19 (5.3%), nasopharyngitis (5.3%) and upper respiratory tract 
infections (4.0%). The majority of these TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity. All TEAEs in the 
SOC Infections and infestations were considered not related by the investigator. The most common 
TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were abdominal pain (5.3%), nausea (5.3%), and 
dysphagia (4.0%).

Two participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and one in the placebo group reported an SAE in 
Part A. (including data through 20 May 2020) 
-  One participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group had one event of Abdominal Pain. This 
participant had colonic polyps which were removed a few days prior to the pain. The event 
was assessed as not related to study drug. 
-  Another participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group had one event of Uterine Polyp. 
Relevant medical history for this participant included uterine polyp. This participant 
underwent a sub-total abdominal hysterectomy 17 days after the diagnosis of worsening 
uterine polyp. The event was assessed as not related to study drug. 
-  One participant in the placebo group, developed an SAE of Suicidal ideation. This event was 
not included in the Part A CSR as the categorization to serious was only identified by the 
study monitor at a later date. The event was of moderate intensity and was not considered 
related to study drug. The participant had concurrent Depression. The event of Suicidal 
ideation started on study day 109 and resolved on study day 313. The treatment with study 
drug was not discontinued. 
➢  Part B 
Table 57 Summary of Serious TEAEs by SOC and PT (Part B SAF) 
Five participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, one participant in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group, and one in the placebo group had a treatment-emergent SAE in the Part B SAE. All were 
assessed as not related to study drug.

In the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, one participant each had an SAE of Depression suicidal (14 y 
/severe; resolving), Campylobacter colitis (16 y/ moderate; resolved), Blood creatine phosphokinase 
abnormal (16-y/ moderate; resolved), Breast cancer (39 y/ severe; not resolved) and Pneumonia 
aspiration (15 y/ severe; resolved). 
In the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, one participant (14 y) had a mild SAE of Suicidal ideation 
following bullying at school. 
In the placebo group, one participant had a severe SAE of Mental status changes (19y/ resolved). 
The 2 participants in the dupilumab groups both had a history of psychiatric illness.  
➢  Part C 
Participants from Part A (Part A/C) 
One participant in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and none in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had a treatment-emergent SAE during the Part C treatment period. 
This participant was in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and had a treatment-emergent SAE 
of Systemic inflammatory response syndrome that started at study day 237, approximately 10 to 12 
hours after the most recent dose of dupilumab. The participant (24 y) had a prior medical history of 
asthma induced by exercise and food and other allergies and experienced severe shortness of breath 
and diaphoresis. At the emergency room, the vital signs were within the normal range, oxygen 
saturation was 100% but laboratory tests showed increased WBC count (30,000 cells/cubic millimeter 
with 7% of bands). After further exploration no obvious source of infection could be identified. The 
participant was treated with two different IV antibiotics during the overnight hospitalization and had no 
further episodes of acute shortness of breath. The participant was discharged the next day with a 
decreased WBC count of 16,000 cells/cubic milliliter treatment and with the presumptive diagnosis of 
“shortness of breath due to asthma and seasonal allergies”. The event resulted in withdrawal of the 
study drug and was considered related to the study drug by the investigator due to the temporal 
relationship to the previous dose. The event was considered severe in intensity and resolved on study 
day 257. 
Participants from Part B (Part B/C) 
The proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) in Part C for participants entering 
from Part B was low with 1 adolescent participant (1.3%) reporting a SAE in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (PTs: diarrhoea and rectal tenesmus, serious criteria for both was 
hospitalization). Both PTs were assessed as not related to study drug by the Investigator. There were 
no TEAEs in the adolescent participants that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
Other significant events 
➢  Part A 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Two participants experienced events of Arthralgia during Part A. 
-  One participant in the dupilumab 300mg QW group, experienced 2 AESIs of Arthralgia: mild 
left shoulder pain on study day 68 and moderate right hip pain on study day 72. Both events 
resolved and were not considered related to study drug. Treatment with study drug 
continued. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023

-  One participant (17 y) in the dupilumab group, experienced an AESI of Arthralgia (joint[s] 
not defined) that led to discontinuation of the study drug. The event started on study day 
106, was of moderate intensity, and resolved on study day 122. The AESI was considered 
related to study drug. 
Injection site reactions 
Table 58 Summary of Injection Site Reaction by PT– (Part A SAF) 
Injection Site Reaction occurred at a higher frequency in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (35.7%) 
than the placebo group (30.8%). None of these injection site reactions were serious or led to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug. All injection site reactions were assessed as mild or 
moderate in intensity. There were no severe injection site reactions and all resolved. Injection Site 
Erythema occurred at a higher frequency in the placebo group (≥5% higher) than the dupilumab 300 
mg QW group. 
Pregnancy 
A pregnancy was reported in one participant in the placebo group, who had requested to withdraw 
from the study after completing Part A treatment. The pregnancy occurred within the 12-week follow-
up period after the last dose and is included in the safety database, however, no data relating to the 
event were included in the clinical database. 
➢  Part B 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The most common type of AESI was herpes simplex infection reported in 3 participants in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 1 in the placebo 
group. Local herpes simplex infections are a known ADR associated with dupilumab use and are 
described in the product labelling. The other AESI categories reported were arthralgia and systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions, both reported in 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 1 in 
the placebo group.

Table 59 Summary of TEAEs of Special Interest by SOC, HLT, and PT (Part B SAF) 
Five participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group, and 3 in the placebo group had an AESI during Part B of the study.  
In the dupilumab 300 mg QW: 
-  One participant had a moderate event of Herpes simplex, assessed by the investigator as 
related to study drug, started on study 127 and resolved on study day 135 without 
treatment. This participant also had an SAE of Campylobacter colitis.  
-  Another participant, with a history of herpes simplex infections, had an event of Herpes 
simplex that was mild and assessed as not related. It started on study day 45 and was 
resolving on treatment with aciclovir. 
-  One participant had 2 separate AESIs reported as Oral herpes. The first was mild, assessed 
as related to study drug, started on study day 3 and resolved without treatment on study 
day 7. The second was moderate, assessed as not related, started on study day 73, and 
resolved without treatment on study day 76. This participant had no relevant medical 
history. 
-  One participant had an AESI of moderate Arthralgia that was assessed as not related. The 
event started on study day 133 and resolved without treatment on study day 149. The 
participant had a concurrent TEAE of moderate Pyrexia, accompanied by muscle aches, sore 
ankles and knees and stiffness and pain in joints. No relevant medical history was reported. 
-  One participant had an AESI of moderate Injection site hypersensitivity that was assessed as 
related to study drug. The event started on study day 11 with an erythematous, mildly itchy 
area at the injection site. On study day 12, a second erythematous area was noted, and the 
following day the participant had low grade fever, chills, malaise, and fatigue. The

participant was administered oral cefalexin, fexofenadine, and paracetamol and topical 
hydrocortisone and the event resolved on study day 16. This event led to temporary 
interruption of the study drug. The next dose was delayed until study day 36. Dosing then 
continued through to the end of treatment visit at week 24. On study day 8, the participant 
had a mild Injection site reaction that resolved the same day. The participant had a positive 
ADA result on study day 84, with a transient low titer of 480 and a negative result at week 
24. The participant had multiple mild injection site reactions, all of which resolved within 24 
hours. The AESI was classified as a systemic hypersensitivity reaction due to the systemic 
symptoms. 
In the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group:  
-  One participant had an AESI of mild Oral herpes starting on study day 2 that resolved on 
study day 25 following drug therapy and was assessed by the investigator as related to 
study drug. Study drug was continued. Relevant medical history included recurrent herpes 
simplex on the lip. The participant received ongoing intermittent treatment for oral herpes 
simplex with valaciclovir, which started approximately 7 years prior to joining the study. This 
participant also had a TEAE of Rhabdomyolysis that led to permanent discontinuation of 
study drug on study day 120. 
In the placebo group: 
-  One participant had a moderate AESI of Oral herpes (outcome: resolved) that was assessed 
as related to study drug. This event led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
-  One participant had 2 concurrent AESIs of mild Arthralgia starting on study day 210 that 
were assessed as not related to study drug, and were ongoing at the last assessment. 
Relevant medical history included mild muscular dystrophy, genu valgum, and pes planus. 
The participant discontinued from the study on study day 289 for reasons unrelated to the 
AESIs. 
-  One participant had a severe AESI of Hypersensitivity on study day 93 (week 13) that was 
assessed as related to study drug and resolved the same day without drug therapy. The 
TEAE occurred 90 minutes after the fourteenth dose of study drug, with symptoms of 
redness around the injection site and vomiting. The participant also had mild TEAEs of 
Fatigue and Palpitations on the same day as the AESI that were also assessed as related to 
study drug. Dosing of study drug continued through week 24. The participant was ADA 
negative. The AESI was classified as a systemic hypersensitivity reaction. 
None of the AESIs were considered to be SAEs.  
Two of the AESIs were reported in adolescent participants: an AESI of Herpes simplex in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and Arthralgia in the placebo group. All other AESIs were reported in 
adult participants.

Injection Site Reactions 
Injection site reactions were reported in a significant higher proportion of participants in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W (54.3%) group than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (37.5%) and placebo (33.3%) groups. 
Of note, the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group received placebo injections every other week, so all 
participants in the study received weekly injections. All injection site reactions were assessed as mild 
or moderate in intensity. None of these injection site reactions were serious and none led to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug. One injection site reaction in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group was classified as an AESI and led to temporary interruption of the study drug (see above).

Infections and infestations 
In the Infections and infestations SOC, the incidence of TEAEs was numerically higher in the dupilumab 
groups (30.0% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 32.1% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group) 
than in the placebo group (23.1%). The pattern of TEAEs within the Infections and infestations SOC 
was closely examined to determine if there was an association of TEAEs of infections with dupilumab 
use. (For more details on AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC see Section Adverse Events for 
Part B) 
In the HLT Viral infections Not elsewhere classified (NEC), the incidence of TEAEs was 5.0% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 4.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 1.3% in the placebo 
group. The higher incidence in the dupilumab groups was mainly driven by Gastroenteritis viral (3.8% 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 1.2% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 0% in the 
placebo group). All TEAEs of Gastroenteritis viral resolved, 3 were mild and 1 was moderate in 
intensity, and all were assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator. 
The reported TEAEs were reviewed for any indication of an increased susceptibility to local infections of 
the esophagus. There was 1 event of Esophageal candidiasis: 
One participant (16 years old) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, had a non-serious, mild TEAE of 
Esophageal candidiasis that began on study day 1 and resolved on day 176. The participant initially 
received a 14-day course of oral fluconazole. The participant had previously received swallowed 
topical/systemic corticosteroids for approximately 7 years until 2 months before screening for this 
study and started treatment with a PPI (lansoprazole) approximately 2.5 months before screening. The 
participant continued study drug, completed Part B, and entered Part C. The event was assessed as 
not related to study drug. 
➢  Part C 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Two participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 1 in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had treatment-emergent AESIs during Part C of the study. 
-  One participant in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had a treatment-emergent AESI 
of Arthralgia. 
- 
The second participant in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group with multiple atopic 
comorbidities had a treatment-emergent AESI of Vernal keratoconjunctivitis of moderate 
intensity that started 132 days after starting dupilumab. The participant received treatment 
with topical eye drops: olopatadine (study day 297 through 319), followed by prednisone 
acetate (study day 319 through 339). This event was assessed by the investigator as related 
to study drug. The event resolved on study day 339. Treatment with study drug was 
continued. This AESI was categorized as a systemic hypersensitivity reaction and as 
keratitis. 
-  One participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group with a history of 
multiple food allergies, other allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic 
conjunctivitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and urticaria, had 2 treatment-emergent AESIs of 
Anaphylactic reaction and Anaphylactic shock. The event of Anaphylactic reaction started on 
study day 267, 6 days after the week 37 dose of dupilumab, after eating food that the 
investigator thought had probably been contaminated with milk products. The participant 
experienced tongue, lip and face swelling, difficulty breathing, and face redness and was 
treated in the emergency room with intravenous corticosteroid, intramuscular EpiPen

(epinephrine) and was started on oral treatment with Zyrtec (cetirizine) and famotidine. 
After 5 hours the participant was sent home and on study day 270, the event was 
considered resolved and the treatment with famotidine and Zyrtec was discontinued. The 
event of Anaphylactic shock started on study day 317, 7 days after the week 44 dose of 
dupilumab, after ingestion of an energy drink. The participant developed nausea and had 
multiple vomiting episodes but no systemic symptoms. Approximately 6 hours later, the 
participant developed congestion and shortness of breath, which led to Anaphylactic shock. 
The participant started treatment with prednisone, Zyrtec (cetirizine) and Pepcid 
(famotidine) (study days 317 through 322), Benadryl (diphenhydramine) (study days 317 
through 323), Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) (study days 318 through 320), Flonase 
(fluticasone propionate) (study days 322 through 323) and oral Allegra (fexofenadine) 
(study days 325 through 334). On study day 334, the event Anaphylactic shock was 
considered resolved. Both events were severe in intensity and assessed by the investigator 
as not related to study drug and gave cross-contaminated food and the energy drink, 
respectively, as suspected causes. In both cases, treatment with study drug was not 
discontinued.

Injection site reactions 
In total, 27.3% of participants reported TEAEs of injection site reactions. The proportion of participants 
who experienced injection site reactions during the Part C treatment period was 35.1% in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 20.0% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group. None of the injection site reactions were severe in intensity, led to permanent

No consistent trend towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time was seen in 
either treatment group for any haematology parameter. Small and similar median reductions in 
eosinophils from baseline were observed in both the dupilumab 300 mg QW and placebo treatment 
groups at week 24. There were no clinically meaningful differences between the 2 treatment groups in 
the number of participants with treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant value (PCSVs) for 
any of these haematology parameters.  
Similar no consistent trend towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time was 
seen in either treatment group for any chemistry parameter, function parameters, electrolyte 
parameters, renal function parameters, liver function parameters and lipid parameters.  
No participant demonstrated a treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted ADA response in either the 
placebo or dupilumab 300 mg QW groups during Part A. One participant in the placebo group had pre-
existing immune-reactivity with low ADA titer at baseline and ADA negative at all post-treatment visits. 
The participant with pre-existing immune-reactivity had a negative Nab response in Part A of the 
study. 
•  Part B 
No consistent trend towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time was seen in 
any treatment group for all haematology parameters except eosinophils. Median eosinophil counts 
were similar at baseline (0.420×109/L in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 0.380×109/L in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 0.430×109/L in the placebo group) and decreased across the 3 
treatment groups, with larger median decreases in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (−0.175×109/L) and 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W groups (−0.150×109/L) than in the placebo group (−0.020×109/L) at week 
24. 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in shifts from baseline in haematology parameters across 
the treatment groups. Only sporadic cases of normal-to-high and normal-to-low shifts from baseline in 
some haematology parameters were observed in each treatment group. No clinically meaningful 
differences were reported between the 3 treatment groups in the number of participants with 
treatment-emergent PCSVs for any of the haematology parameters with 8/75 (10.7%) in the placebo 
group, 7/76 (9.2%) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group and 5/72 (6.9%) in the dupilumab 300mg 
QW group. No consistent trend towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time 
and no clinically meaningful differences in the number of participants with treatment-emergent PCSVs 
for any of the chemistry parameters was seen in and between any of the treatment groups for any 
chemistry parameter. 
A treatment-emergent ADA response to dupilumab was observed in 2 participants in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W group and in 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. These participants 
developed transient, low, or moderate titer responses that had no impact on functional dupilumab 
exposure. Only one participant receiving dupilumab 300 mg Q2W was NAb positive. ADA titer had no 
impact on functional dupilumab exposure in the 3 participants for whom a treatment-emergent ADA 
response was observed. 
•  Part C 
No consistent trend towards an increase or decrease or clinically meaningful trends in shifts from the 
Part A/C baseline in mean or median values over time was seen for any haematology parameter during 
Part A/C. Mean eosinophil counts were stable over the treatment period and during the follow-up 
period in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. There were small mean reductions 
in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group at week 52, which returned to baseline values at the end

of follow-up. There were no clinically meaningful treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant 
values (PCSVs) for any of the haematology parameters during Part C. 
No consistent trend towards an increase or decrease or clinically meaningful trends in shifts from the 
Part C baseline in mean or median values over time were seen for any chemistry parameter during 
Part C like metabolic function parameters, electrolyte parameters, renal function parameters, liver 
function parameters, and lipid parameters. 
One treatment-emergent PCSV for chemistry parameters was reported as a TEAE of Blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased was reported in 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 
mg QW group. The event was initially mild and then worsened to moderate. The event was assessed 
as not related to study drug.  
Treatment-emergent ADA responses to dupilumab were observed in 7% of participants (5 of 71), most 
of whom exhibited a transient, low-titer response and had received placebo in Part A. All 5 participants 
with treatment-emergent ADA responses became positive for ADA in Part C. One participant treated 
with placebo in Part A developed a treatment-emergent, moderate titer ADA response and was also 
positive for neutralizing antibodies in Part C. No other participants were positive for neutralizing 
antibodies in Part C. 
Treatment-emergent ADA responses to dupilumab were observed in 7% of participants (5 of 71). 4/34 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and 1 of 37 dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW 
participants. All 5 participants with treatment-emergent ADA responses became positive for ADA in 
Part C. Of these 5 participants 3 experienced TEAEs. All 3 participants were in the placebo/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group.  
In Part B/C 6 ADA-positive participants were reported. A review of their TEAEs did not identify any 
specific ADA related safety events. None of these 6 participants reported anaphylactic or serum 
sickness/serum sickness like reactions. 
Safety in special populations 
The subgroups analysed for safety were: 
•  Age (≥12 to <18 years, ≥18 years) 
•  Sex (Male, Female) 
•  Race (White, Black or African American/Asian/Other/Asian/Not Reported [combined 
due to small group size]) 
•  Duration of EoE (<5 years, ≥5 years) 
•  Prior use of swallowed topical steroids (STC) for the treatment of EoE (Yes, No) 
•  History of food allergy (Yes, No) 
•  History of AD (Yes, No) 
•  History of asthma (Yes, No) 
•  Baseline weight group (<60 kg, ≥60 kg) 
Subgroup analyses were performed for all TEAEs by SOC and PT and TEAEs of special interest by AESI 
category and PT.  
Overall, the subgroup analyses did not reveal marked differences in the incidence of TEAEs within 
subgroups. The largest differences in overall TEAE incidence in the combined dupilumab groups were 
seen in the age subgroup, with a higher incidence in adolescents (90.6%) than in adults (77.7%) and 
in the subgroup concerning EoE disease duration. Participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group with 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

an EoE disease duration less than 5 years had a higher incidence in TEAEs compared to participants 
with a longer duration.

Subgroup Analysis by Age Group 
•  Part A 
The incidence of TEAEs for adolescents was similar to that of adults, with numerically higher proportion 
of adolescents reporting general disorder and administrative site conditions related to injections in both

the placebo (44.4%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW groups (54.5%) compared to adult participants in 
both the placebo (36.7%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW groups (35.5%). 
•  Part B 
In the subgroup analysis by age group, in both dupilumab 300 mg treatment groups the incidence of 
TEAEs was higher in the adolescent cohort versus the adult cohort (QW: 92.3% of adolescents versus 
79.6% of adults; Q2W: 85.2% of adolescents versus 74.1% of adults). In the placebo group, the 
incidence of TEAEs was similar (73.1% of adolescents and 69.2% of adults). 
In both age groups, the SOC with the highest incidence of TEAEs across all treatment groups was 
General disorders and administration site conditions. Within the adolescent subgroup, the incidence of 
TEAEs in this SOC was similar across the treatment groups: the lowest incidence was 50.0% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group and the highest 59.3% in the Q2W group.  
The most common PTs across all treatment groups in the adolescent subgroup were Injection site 
reaction and Injection site swelling in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. Within the adult subgroup, 
there was more variability, with the lowest incidence in the placebo group (32.7%) and the highest in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (55.6%). In the adult subgroup, the most common PT was Injection 
site reaction in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and placebo groups, and Injection site erythema in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group.  
Infections and infestations was the SOC with the next highest incidence in the dupilumab groups. In 
both age subgroups the lowest incidence was seen in the placebo group (23.1% in both subgroups). In 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the incidences were 38.5% in adolescents and 25.9% in adults, and 
in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group 33.3% and 31.5%, respectively. No individual PT driving the 
differences was identified. 
In the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders, the incidence was similar across both age subgroups and across 
treatment groups (between 17.3% and 27.8%), except for the adolescent placebo group with an 
incidence of 42.3% that was mainly driven by the PT of Diarrhoea. 
In the SOCs Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, the incidences of TEAEs in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group was higher within the 
adolescent subgroup than in the placebo group (25.9% versus 19.2% in the placebo group for 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and 33.3% versus 15.4% for Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders) and also if the adolescent subgroup is compared to the adult subgroup (incidences of 
7.4% and 5.6% in the adult subgroup for the 2 SOCs, respectively). No individual PT driving these 
differences was identified. In the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the incidences of TEAEs were lower 
versus placebo for both SOCs in both age groups. 
•  Part C 
➢  Adolescent Participants from Part A (Part A/C) 
In the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 7 (77.8%) adolescent participants experienced a TEAE, 
and 2 (22.2%) experienced a drug-related TEAE the proportions in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group were 8 (80.0%) and 4 (40.0%), respectively. The most frequently 
reported PTs during Part C were Acne (4 participants; 44.4%) and Injection site reaction (2 
participants; 22.2%) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group compared to Injection site reaction 
(3 participants; 30.0%), and Injection site swelling, Foot fracture and Headache (all in 2 participants; 
20.0%) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
TEAEs related to study drug were reported in 2 (22.2%) adolescent participants in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group (Injection site reaction, Conjunctivitis allergic, and Vernal

keratoconjunctivitis) and in 4 (40.0%) adolescent participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 
300 mg QW group (Injection site reaction, Injection site swelling, Injection site erythema, and 
Injection site pain). 
Table 66 Summary of TEAEs Reported by ≥10% of All Adolescent Participants (≥12 to <18 years) 
During Part C 28-Week Treatment Period by Primary SOC and PT (Part C SAF – Participants from 
Part A) 
➢  Adolescent Participants from Part B (Part B/C) 
With the responses to the Request for Supplementary Information the MAH submitted additional data 
from 75 adolescent participants up to 1 year (exposure from Part B and Part C combined) in adolescent 
participants with EoE.  
Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 70.7% of adolescent 
participants during the treatment period in Part B/C. This was similar to the adult population where 
TEAEs were reported in 65.1% of adult participants during the treatment period in Part B/C. The 
proportion of adolescent participants who experienced a TEAE was similar across the treatment groups, 
ranging from 69.2% (18/26) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 70.0% 
(7/10) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 70.8% (17/24) in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, to 73.3% (11/15) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. 
The majority of TEAEs in both adolescents and adults were mild in intensity. The most commonly 
affected system organ class (SOC) in both adolescents and adults was General disorders and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

administration site conditions with 33.3% (25/75 adolescent participants), while the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had the lowest incidence (20.0%). This SOC incidence was 
mostly driven by various injection site reaction preferred terms (PTs) including injection site reaction 
(17.3% of adolescent participants), injection site pain (10.7% of adolescent participants), injection site 
erythema (5.3% of adolescent participants), and injection site swelling (5.3% of adolescent 
participants). The proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) was low with 1 
adolescent participant (1.3%) reporting a SAE in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group.

With the responses to the Request for Supplementary Information the MAH submitted an analysis 
higher trough concentration at lower body weight and its impact on the safety, especially on the 
adolescent participants. 
The number of participants in weight group ≥40 kg and <50 kg receiving 300 mg QW was very limited 
in study R668-EE-1774 (3 participants in Part A, 5 participants in Part B, 5 participants in Part A/C, 3 
of whom received dupilumab 300 mg QW for 52 weeks, and 7 participants in Part B/C, 5 of whom 
received dupilumab 300 mg QW for 52 weeks). Although the Ctrough concentrations are higher in the 
lower weight group, no specific safety concerns were identified for this group of participants. All TEAEs 
were mild to moderate in intensity, no TEAEs led to permanent dose withdrawal, and no SAEs or AEs of 
severe intensity were reported for this group.

Due to the small number of participants in the lower weight group treated with dupilumab 300 mg QW 
in study R668-EE-1774, a similar analysis was conducted with data from participants treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW in the AD clinical trials R668-AD-1224 (including 10 patients within weight 
group ≥40 kg and <50 kg receiving 300 mg QW (52 week treatment period)), R668-AD-1334 (A Phase 
3 study including 7 patients within weight group ≥40 kg and <50 kg receiving 300 mg QW (16 week 
treatment period)) and R668-AD-1416 (A Phase 3 Study including 14 patients within weight group ≥40 
kg and <50 kg receiving 300 mg QW (16 week treatment period)) to determine whether the small 
numeric differences in the overall safety profile in the EoE studies were consistently observed for 
participants of lower and higher weights. 
The data comparing the safety profile of participants weighing ≥40 kg and <50 kg versus participants 
weighing >50 kg in these studies showed no clinically meaningful differences between the two weight 
groups. 
Pooled Analyses by age group 
In the Pool 2a subgroup analysis by age group show that in both dupilumab 300 mg treatment groups 
the incidence of TEAEs was higher in the adolescent cohort versus the adult cohort (dupilumab 300 mg 
QW: 94.6% of adolescents versus 80.0% of adults; dupilumab 300 mg Q2W: 85.2% of adolescents 
versus 74.1% of adults). In the placebo group, the difference in incidence of TEAEs was less marked 
(80.0% of adolescents versus 72.0% of adults).

Table 72 Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Adolescents During the 24-Week 
Treatment Period – Pool 2a – SAF 
The SOC with the highest incidence of TEAEs across all treatment groups in both age groups was 
General disorders and administration site conditions. Within the adolescent subgroup, the incidence of 
TEAEs in this SOC was similar across the treatment groups. The lowest incidence was 51.4% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group and placebo group and the highest 59.3% in the Q2W group. Injection 
site reaction was the most common PT across all treatment groups in the adolescent subgroup, with 
the highest incidence in the placebo group (40.0% versus 32.4% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
and 33.3% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group). Within the adult subgroup, the incidence in this SOC 
was lower versus adolescents and there was more variability, with the lowest incidence in the placebo 
group (35.4%) and the highest in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (55.6%). 
The next highest incidence in the dupilumab groups was seen in the SOC Infections and infestations. 
The lowest incidence was seen in the placebo group (28.6% in the adolescent subgroup and 23.2% in 
the adult subgroup). In the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the incidences were 35.1% in adolescents 
and 30.6% in adults, and in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group 33.3% and 31.5%, respectively. There 
was no individual PT driving the differences. Furthermore, there was no apparent difference in the 
pattern of TEAEs between adults and adolescents. 
The incidence in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders was similar across both age subgroups and across 
treatment groups (between 20.0% and 27.8%), except for the adolescent placebo group with an 
incidence of 37.1%. There was no individual PT driving this difference. 
In the SOCs Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, within the adolescent subgroup the incidences of TEAEs in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group were higher versus placebo (25.9% versus 17.1% in the placebo group for Respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders and 33.3% versus 11.4% for Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders), but 
the incidence in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group was lower versus placebo (16.2% and 2.7% for the 
2 SOCs, respectively). 
Other Subgroup Analyses 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the other subgroup analyses.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new drug-drug interactions studies were performed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
•  Part A 
One participant in dupilumab 300 mg QW group and no participant in the placebo group experienced a 
TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation during Part A of the study. The participant in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW group discontinued the study due to Arthralgia. This event was moderate in 
intensity and was assessed by the investigator as related to study drug. 
•  Part B 
Two participants in each treatment group experienced TEAEs that led to permanent discontinuation of 
study drug. In the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 1 participant permanently discontinued study drug 
due to a serious TEAE of Breast cancer and 1 due to non-serious TEAEs of Hypermobility syndrome and 
Myalgia. In the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 2 participants permanently discontinued study drug 
due to non-serious TEAEs, 1 participant due to Rhabdomyolysis and 1 participant due to 2 TEAEs i.e. 
Congenital coronary artery malformation (first discovered during the study) and Dyspnoea. In the 
placebo group, 2 participants permanently discontinued study drug due to non-serious TEAEs of Oral 
herpes and Hepatic enzyme increased, respectively. 
Two participants in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 2 participants in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group, and 2 in the placebo group had at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent withdrawal of study drug 
during Part B of the study. 
In the dupilumab 300 mg QW group: 
− 1 participant discontinued study drug due to a serious and severe TEAE of Breast cancer (outcome: 
not resolved). Study drug was permanently discontinued due to this SAE. No relevant medical history 
was reported. On study day 55, the participant detected a mass in the left breast. The last dose (the 
12th) of study drug was administered on study day 79. On study day 85, following a mammogram, 
Breast cancer was reported as an SAE and the participant withdrew from the study the same day. 
− 1 participant discontinued study drug due to non-serious, moderate TEAEs of Hypermobility 
syndrome and Myalgia that were both ongoing at the last assessment. Both events were assessed by 
the investigator as not related to study drug. The participant’s medical history included chronic pain 
from hypermobility, vitamin D deficiency, osteopenia, neuralgia, and myalgia. Both events started on 
study day 31, after 5 doses of study drug. The physician decided to withdraw the participant from the 
study on study day 61, after a total of 8 doses of study drug. 
In the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, all 3 TEAEs leading to permanent withdrawal of study drug were 
non-serious: 
− 1 participant discontinued study drug due to moderate Rhabdomyolysis starting on study day 115. 
The event was assessed by the investigator as related to study drug and was ongoing at the time of 
the last assessment. The most recent dose of study drug prior to the event was administered on study 
day 114 and the last dose in the study on study day 120. The participant had a mild AE of Blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased that started during screening and resolved on study day 8 (value on 
study day 1 was 286 IU/L [normal range 24-207 IU/L]). A muscle biopsy was done on study day 135 
(results not provided). The participant had a PCSV for creatine kinase on study day 129 of 4795 IU/L, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 148/179 
 
 
 
 
which decreased to 222 IU/L on study day 142. The participant discontinued from the study on study 
day 162 due to the TEAE. 
− 1 participant discontinued study drug due to 2 TEAEs of moderate Congenital coronary artery 
malformation and mild Dyspnoea, both of which were assessed as not related and were resolving. The 
malformation of the right coronary artery was discovered on study day 170, on the same day as the 
increasing dyspnoea started (and the last day of study drug dosing). Relevant medical history included 
asthma and Klinefelter’s syndrome. The participant discontinued from the study on study day 259 due 
to the TEAEs. 
In the placebo group, both TEAEs leading to permanent withdrawal of study drug were non-serious: 
− 1 participant permanently discontinued study drug due to a moderate TEAE of Oral herpes. Relevant 
medical history included oral herpes. The event started on study day 24, after 3 doses of study drug, 
and resolved on study day 51 following treatment with aciclovir. The TEAE was assessed as related to 
study drug by the investigator. The participant discontinued from the study on study day 29 due to the 
TEAE. 
− 1 participant permanently discontinued study drug due to a moderate TEAE of Hepatic enzyme 
increased. The participant had no relevant medical history. The event started on study day 87, after 13 
doses of study drug, and was ongoing at the last assessment. The TEAE was assessed as not related to 
study drug by the investigator. The participant had an AST of 218 IU/L. Other TEAEs reported were 
mild Headache (study days 50 through 52) and moderate Dyspepsia (ongoing from study day 73). The 
participant discontinued from the study on study day 121 due to the TEAE. 
•  Part C 
Two participants in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group and none in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had a TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation during 
Part C of the study 
One participant, a 24-year-old female, with a treatment-emergent SAE of severe intensity 69 days 
after starting dupilumab in Part C that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug (see also section 
serious adverse events). A second participant in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group had a TEAE 
that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug (Arthralgia). The participant, a 36-year-old male, 
developed moderate bilateral elbow arthralgia 51 days after starting dupilumab in Part C.

The results for Pool 2b only captured the Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (which are already 
summarized in Pool 2a) owing to fewer AESI categories in the R668-EE-1324 study (only Anaphylactic

• 
Injection Site Reactions

The results for Pool 2b were consistent with Pool 2a.  
In Study R668-EE-1774 Part A/C The proportion of participants who experienced injection site 
reactions during the Part A/C 28-week treatment period was 35.1% in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group, similar to that of 37.7% for the dupilumab 300 mg QW in Pool 2a and 20.0% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, suggestive of a reduction in injection site 
reaction incidence with continued dupilumab treatment.

•  Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System 
In Pool 2a, the SOCs with a TEAE incidence ≥10% in any treatment group and a higher incidence in 
any dupilumab group versus placebo were General disorders and administration site conditions, 
Infections and infestations, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications. The results in Pool 2b were consistent with the Pool 2a results. 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 
In the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group the proportion of participants with TEAEs in the SOC General 
disorders and administration site conditions was higher (56.8%) than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(41.8%) and placebo groups (40.2%) and mostly driven by PTs of Injection site reactions, Injection 
site erythema, Injection site pain, Injection site swelling, Injection site bruising, and Injection site 
urticaria. 
Infections and Infestations 
The proportion of participants with TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was higher in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW (32.0%) and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (32.1%) groups than in the placebo 
group (24.8%). This was partly driven by TEAEs of COVID-19 and Upper respiratory tract infection. 
The pattern of TEAEs within the Infections and infestations SOC was closely examined by the MAH to 
determine if there was an association of TEAEs of infections with dupilumab use (see also AR Section 
Adverse Events Part B). This approach was also taken with the pooled data. 
To investigate this apparent imbalance further, data from study R668-EE-1774 were pooled with data 
from 6 other double-blind, placebo-controlled dupilumab studies completed during the COVID-19 
pandemic. In this pooled safety data from 7 dupilumab studies, the incidence of COVID-19 infections 
was low in both dupilumab (2.5%) and placebo arms (1.5%). This difference of 1.0% is attributable to 
Study R668-EE-1774 Part B. Upon excluding data from study R668-EE-1774 Part B, the incidence of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 156/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COVID-19 infections was numerically lower in the dupilumab arm (1.7%) as compared to the placebo 
arm (1.8%). 
The majority of the events of COVID-19 infection in the dupilumab arm were reported as mild to 
moderate with no serious events reported, and all events were reported as resolved. 
The totality of the data from the dupilumab clinical trial program and post-marketing data, as well as 
the published literature, shows no evidence of an increased incidence of opportunistic or serious 
infections with dupilumab, including COVID-19. The exceptions are: increase in localized, herpes virus 
infections, which are generally a reactivation of endogenous infection. Furthermore, an increase in 
helminthic infections in some paediatric studies and a decrease in bacterial skin infections in patients 
with AD. 
There were no additional serious or severe infections, infections leading to study drug discontinuation, 
or other infections of concern to those reported for the Part B.  
Table 83 Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Preferred Term ≥2% in 
Any Treatment Group) in the System Organ Class of Infections and Infestations During the 24-
Week Treatment Period - Pool 2a – SAF 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders 
The proportion of participants with TEAEs in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC 
was slightly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg QW (9.8%) and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (11.1%) groups 
than in the placebo group (8.5%). However, Arthralgia is a known ADR for dupilumab and was defined 
as an AESI in study R668-EE-1774.  
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
The proportion of participants with TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC was higher in the 
placebo group (28.2%) than in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (21.3%) and the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W group (25.9%), with the most frequent PTs being Diarrhoea, Nausea, and Abdominal pain in the 
placebo group, all at a higher incidence than both dupilumab groups.  
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 157/179 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A higher incidence of TEAEs in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC was reported 
for the placebo group (16.2%) compared to the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (13.1%) and dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W group (13.6%). The most frequent PT being Oropharyngeal pain in the placebo group, 
which was at a higher incidence than both dupilumab groups. 
Nervous System Disorders 
Also, for the Nervous system disorders SOC more TEAEs were reported in the placebo group (17.9%) 
compared to the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (11.5%) and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (12.3%). 
The only frequent PT was Headache. 
•  Adverse Drug Reactions 
Two PTs in Pool 2a were identified meeting the criteria for ADRs: Injection site swelling and Injection 
site bruising. Injection site reactions have previously been identified as common ADRs in other 
dupilumab indications (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP) and are listed as ADRs in the SmPC. 
Table 84 Cox Hazard Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval for Treatment Emergent Injection Site 
Swelling or Injection Site Bruising During 24-Week Treatment Period – Pool 2a – SAF 
•  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
In R668-EE-1774 Parts A, B, and A/C, and in the R668-EE-1324 study, there were no consistent trends 
towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time in any treatment group for any 
haematology parameter except eosinophils. Mean and median baseline blood eosinophil counts were 
similar across the treatment groups and there were larger mean and median changes from baseline in 
the dupilumab groups versus placebo. Median decreases to week 24 were 0.17×109/L in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group, 0.15 ×109/L in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 0.06×109/L in the placebo 
group. Furthermore, there were no clinically meaningful trends in shifts from baseline in haematology 
parameters in all treatment groups. 
There were no trends towards an increase or decrease in mean or median values over time in any 
treatment group and no clinically meaningful differences between the 3 treatment groups in the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

number of participants with treatment-emergent PCSVs for any chemistry parameter. Additionally, no 
clinically meaningful trends in shifts from baseline in chemistry parameters in all treatment groups 
were reported. Sporadic cases of normal-to-high and normal-to-low shifts from baseline in some 
chemistry parameters were observed in all treatment groups. 
• 
Immunogenicity 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA-positive responses was <5% in all treatment groups and 
therefore the planned statistical analysis into possible associations between immunogenicity and safety 
were not done. The adverse event profiles of participants with ADA-positive responses were examined 
at the individual participant level. In general, the available immunogenicity data did not show a 
clinically significant effect of ADA on safety. There was no clear association between injection site 
reactions seen across all the treatment groups or other commonly related TEAEs and development of 
ADA. 
In Pool 2a (phase 3 placebo-controlled pooled study parts), a transient, treatment-emergent ADA-
positive response was seen in 1.5% (3/195) of participants receiving dupilumab and 0.8% (1/118) in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. In Pool 2b, a transient, treatment-emergent ADA-positive response 
was seen in 1.4% (3/218) of participants receiving dupilumab and in 0.7% (1/141) in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW Group. 
Supportive Study 
In Study R668-EE-1324 the safety was evaluated in 23 patients who received at least 1 dose of 
dupilumab compared to 24 patients who received at least 1 dose of placebo. The mean treatment 
duration was slightly greater in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group. Similarly, the mean 
duration of observation was higher in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group. 
Overall, dupilumab at 300 mg SC QW for 12 weeks was well tolerated in the study patients with active 
EoE, and had a safety profile comparable to that of the placebo-treated patients. 
During the 12-week treatment period, 15 (62.5%) patients in the placebo group and 18 (78.3%) 
patients in the dupilumab group experienced at least 1 TEAE. The majority of the TEAEs were of mild 
or moderate severity for both treatment groups.

The most common TEAEs in the dupilumab-treated patients were Injection Site Erythema (34.8% 
versus 8.3% for placebo), Injection Site Inflammation and Injection Site Rash (13.0% versus 0 for 
placebo for both PTs), Injection Site Urticarial (8.7% versus 0 for placebo), Nasopharyngitis (17.4% 
versus 4.2% for placebo), and Pain in Extremity (8.7% versus 0 for placebo). 
A higher percentage of patients in the dupilumab group than in placebo group experienced any TEAE 
that was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. The majority of such TEAEs 
were injection site reaction related. 
No death occurred during this study. 
No patient in either treatment group experienced an SAE during the 12-week treatment period. Three 
patients (13.0%) in the dupilumab group experienced 3 SAEs during the follow-up period of 16 weeks 
(Elevated CPK due to excessive strenuous exercise, spontaneous abortion most likely due to history 
cervical surgery, Drug hypersensitivity other than dupilumab).  
Two patients in the dupilumab group experienced a severe TEAE of experienced a non-serious severe 
Hypoventilation (verbatim term: Hypoventilation during Upper GI Endoscopy) during the 12-week 
treatment period on study day 87, during the endoscopy procedure, performed under sedation, which 
was resolved the same day. Another patient experienced a serious severe Food Allergy during the 
post-treatment follow-up period on study day 90, which was resolved on day 92. All 3 events were 
assessed by the investigator as not related to the study drug. 
One (4.3%) patient in the dupilumab group and none in the placebo group experienced a TEAE that led 
to permanent discontinuation of study drug. The participant, a 27-year-old female, experienced a non-
serious moderate Nail Disorder (verbatim term: Left Index Fingernail Indentation) on study day 37, 
after receiving 5 weekly doses of dupilumab. The patient received her sixth dose on study day 38. 
Afterwards, the event led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. The event was assessed by the 
investigator to be not related to study drug. The event was ongoing at the time of her last study visit. 
No clinically significant changes or differences between the 2 treatment groups were observed in 
laboratory test results, vital signs, 12-lead ECG findings, and physical examination findings. Anti-
dupilumab antibodies were not detected in any patient in the placebo group. Two of the 23 dupilumab-
treated patients developed a treatment-emergent ADA response with low titers at week 28 (the last 
study visit). The ADA status for both cases was classified as indeterminate and both positive ADA 
results were negative in the NAb assay. 
Post marketing experience 
Over 10,565 study participants have been exposed to dupilumab (as of 28 September 2021 data lock 
point). Of these, approximately 3,000 participants have been exposed to dupilumab 300 mg QW in the 
phase 2 asthma, AD, and CRSwNP studies and the phase 3 AD and EoE studies. In Study R668-AD-
1225, an open-label extension AD study, approximately 2,250 participants have been treated with 
dupilumab 300 mg QW for at least 52 weeks. Adult participants may be treated with dupilumab 300 
mg QW for up to 5 years in the open-label extension AD study.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Study R668-EE-1774 was the pivotal phase 3 study consisting of 3 parts and a follow up period. Part 
A and Part B (each consisting of a 24-week double-blind treatment period), Part C (a 28-week 
extended active treatment period), and a 12-week follow-up period. In Part A of the study dupilumab 
300 mg QW or matching placebo were administered. In Part B participants received dupilumab 300 mg 
QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W or matching placebo. In Part A/C all patients received dupilumab 300 
mg QW. In Part B/C patients received either dupilumab 300 mg QW or dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. 
The assessment of safety was a secondary objective, the aim was to evaluate the safety, tolerability 
and immunogenicity of dupilumab treatment for up to 52 weeks in adult and adolescent patients with 
EoE (in study R668-EE-1774) and in adult patients with EoE (in study R668-EE-1324).  
In total, 367 participants were enrolled. Of these 263 participants received dupilumab. In total, 73 
adolescents received any dose of dupilumab, of which 46 received the proposed dose of dupilumab 300 
mg QW. Of these, 10 adolescents received dupilumab 300 mg QW over a period of about 1 year (Part 
A/C). At the CHMP request, additional data for 75 adolescents participants (Part B/C) were submitted 
including 24 adolescents who received dupilumab 300 mg QW over a period of about 1 year. 
Part A 
The incidence of all TEAEs reported during Part A of the study was similar between the 2 treatment 
groups (dupilumab 85.7% compared to placebo 82.11%). The highest incidence of TEAEs was reported 
in the SOC General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions with 38.5% in the placebo group and 
40.5% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and were mostly driven by injection site reactions. All 
Injection Site Reactions were mild or moderate in intensity and all resolved. No events of systemic 
hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, and no deaths were reported with dupilumab 300 
mg QW. 
Two treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (Abdominal Pain and 
Uterine Polyp) and one in the placebo group (Suicidal ideation). All were assessed as unrelated to 
treatment, which is reasonable based on the submitted data. One participant in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group permanently discontinued study drug due to a non-serious TEAE of Arthralgia. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs for adolescents was similar to that of adults. However, a numerically 
higher proportion of adolescents reported general disorder and administrative site conditions related to 
injections in the placebo (44.4%) and the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (54.5%) compared to adult 
participants in the placebo (36.7%) and the dupilumab 300 mg QW groups (35.5%). 
Part B 
The incidence of all TEAEs reported during Part B of the study was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg 
groups (QW: 83.8%; Q2W: 77.8%) than in the placebo group (70.5%). This difference was mainly 
driven by injection site reactions (most frequent TEAE reported in each treatment group). All injection 
site reactions were assessed as mild or moderate in intensity and all resolved.  
The majority of the TEAEs of Pyrexia were associated with other symptoms and were mild in intensity. 
All were assessed as not related to study drug, which is reasonable. No deaths were reported in Part B. 
Five treatment-emergent SAEs (Depression suicidal, Campylobacter colitis, Blood creatine 
phosphokinase abnormal, Breast cancer and Pneumonia aspiration) were reported in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group, 1 SAE (Suicidal ideation) in the 300 mg Q2W group and 1 SAE (Mental Status 
Changes) in the placebo group. All were assessed as unrelated to study treatment, which appears 
reasonable. However, five out of seven SAEs in Part B were reported in adolescents, of which 4 SAEs 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 161/179 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred in the dupilumab 300 mg QW treated adolescents. Taking the total number of dupilumab 
treated adolescent participant into account, this higher incidence of SAEs in this age group was further 
discussed by the MAH. None of the SAEs was considered related to dupilumab by Investigators as all 
participants had alternate aetiologies and/or risk factors in past medical history. Furthermore, no 
pattern could be identified and none led to treatment discontinuation. The clarification presented by 
the MAH is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a higher incidence of TEAEs in 
the Infections and infestations SOC in both dupilumab groups versus the placebo group, mainly driven 
by a higher incidence of COVID-19 TEAEs in the dupilumab groups. One of the TEAEs in this SOC was 
an SAE (Campylobacter colitis) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group that resolved without antibiotic 
treatment and was assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator, which is reasonable. 
None of the COVID-19 TEAEs was serious or led to study drug discontinuation. The majority were mild 
in intensity. One Covid-19 TEAE in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group was of severe intensity and was 
resolved after 19 days.  
All COVID-19 TEAEs were assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator and occurred in 
participants who were either unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated for COVID-19 at the time of the 
event. The MAH conducted a review of COVID-19 cases throughout the dupilumab clinical database 
and the patterns of TEAEs within the Infections and infestations SOC were closely examined to 
determine if there was an association of TEAEs of infections with dupilumab use. No imbalances in 
COVID-19 or infection TEAEs were identified. Furthermore, a review of the reporting rate of COVID-19 
infection during dupilumab use, calculated using global post-marketing pharmacovigilance data, 
indicated no increased occurrence of COVID-19 infection when compared to the incidence rate of 
COVID-19 in 6 countries (US, Colombia, Brazil, UK, UAE, and Canada). Based on the data submitted, 
the conclusion drawn by the MAH that the imbalance of COVID-19 TEAEs observed in this study was 
not representative of the larger experience with the drug is reasonable. 
There were 2 AESIs classified as systemic hypersensitivity reactions, reported in 1 participant in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 1 in the placebo group, respectively. The event in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group of Injection site hypersensitivity resolved after a short delay of study treatment. 
The participant continued and completed study treatment in Part B and entered Part C.  
The safety profile for adolescents showed higher incidences of TEAEs in the dupilumab 300 mg groups 
(QW: 92.3%; Q2W: 85.2%) than in the placebo group (73.1%) mainly driven by General disorders 
and administration site conditions, however there was no consistent pattern in the incidence of PTs by 
treatment group. Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity.  
Two TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study drug were reported by one adolescent 
participant in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (Congenital coronary artery malformation and 
Dyspnoea). 
There were larger median decreases in eosinophils in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W groups 
versus the placebo group. Otherwise, there were no clinically meaningful changes or differences 
between the 3 treatment groups observed for chemistry, haematology, urinalysis laboratory values, 
vital signs, ECG, or physical examination findings. 
Part C 
The safety profile of dupilumab 300 mg QW in the 28-week treatment period was consistent with that 
observed in adolescents and adults in the 24-week placebo-controlled Part A of the study. (Part A/C)  
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. In the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group, 73.0% of participants experienced a TEAE and 40.5% experienced a drug-related TEAE. The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

corresponding proportions in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group were 60.0% 
and 20.0%, respectively. 
There was a higher incidence of drug-related TEAEs in those participants previously treated with 
placebo and switched to dupilumab in Part C, which was mainly driven by the higher incidence of 
injection site reactions. This was consistent with other dupilumab clinical studies where injection site 
reactions tend to occur more commonly in the first few weeks after initiation of dupilumab.  
In the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, one participant had a SAE (Systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome) of severe intensity that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. However, 
due to the rapidity of recovery without specific treatment and the discharge diagnosis of “asthma 
attack and allergic reaction”, the MAH believes that the discharge diagnosis is a better characterization 
of the patient’s TEAE, which can be followed based on data submitted.   
Another participant in the placebo/dupilumab group had a TEAE (Arthralgia) that led to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug. Both events were assessed as related to study drug, which is 
reasonable. No treatment-emergent SAEs or TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study 
drug were reported in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group.  
Other AESIs reported were Vernal keratoconjunctivitis and 1 participant in the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group reported AESIs of Anaphylactic reaction and Anaphylactic shock, 
which was related to food allergy and not to the study drug.  
There were no clinically significant trends observed for haematology, chemistry, or urinalysis 
laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, or physical examination findings. 
Treatment-emergent ADA responses to dupilumab were observed in 7% of participants (5 of 71), most 
of whom exhibited a transient, low-titer response. One participant developed a treatment-emergent, 
moderate titer ADA response and was also positive for neutralizing antibodies in Part C.  
During the 28-week treatment period in Part C for participants enrolling from Part B (Part B/C), the 
majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The proportion of participants who experienced a 
TEAE across the treatment groups ranged from 59.5% in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group to 
70.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. The proportions of participants 
experiencing a drug-related TEAE were higher in participants who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W in 
Part B/C, regardless of the previous Part B treatment (32.4% in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group and 31.6% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 18.9% in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW and in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW groups. 
The most commonly affected SOC was General disorders and administration site conditions. Overall, 
the proportion of participants with TEAEs in this SOC was 30.3% (46/152 adult participants). The 
majority of TEAEs were mild in intensity. No new safety signals were identified and no deaths or TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported. 
Pooled data (Pool 2a and 2b) 
Pool 2a is the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 safety pool intended to assess the safety profile 
of dupilumab (300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W) versus placebo in adult and adolescent patients with EoE. 
Part A and Part B participants who received any dose of study drug were included in Pool 2a. 
Pool 2b included participants from the phase 2 study R668-EE-1324 with a 12-week placebo-controlled 
treatment period and the phase 3 study R668-EE-1774 Part A and Part B with a 24-week treatment 
period. 
The data show that Injection site reactions were the most commonly reported type of TEAE in all 
treatment groups. None were severe, serious or led to study drug discontinuation. Injection site 
swelling and Injection site bruising met the criteria for ADRs. Injection site reactions have previously 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 163/179 
 
 
 
 
been identified as common ADRs in other dupilumab indications (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP). However, 
the incidence of Injection Site Reaction reported in all Parts of Study R668-EE-1774 and in Study 
R668-EE-1324 is high in the EoE population. Although, the reactions were mild to moderate in 
intensity, the high incidence could impair the compliance of patients, especially in the younger age 
group. The MAH was asked to discuss possible reasons for the higher incidences of injection site 
reactions. In the summary of HLT Injection site reactions in adult and adolescent groups in study 
R668-EE-1774 parts A, B, A/C and B/C provided by the MAH no clear pattern regarding the incidence 
for ISRs can be identified. The frequency of ISRs varied considerably, ranging from 25% to 50% for 
placebo compared to 10.0% to 59.3% for dupilumab. Furthermore, considering the data from Part B/C, 
no dose-dependent correlation for the ISRs could be identified. This issue was considered resolved. 
There was a low proportion of participants with TEAEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation 
and there no deaths were reported in pool 2a and 2b. There was no evidence of a pattern among the 
reported SAEs to suggest any relationship to dupilumab treatment.  
Two events of systemic hypersensitivity were reported in Pool 2a. One in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group and one in the placebo group. Both were associated with injection site reactions and concurrent 
systemic symptoms. In both cases treatment with study drug was continued. 
The risk of infections was closely examined in the polled analyses due to a higher incidence of reported 
TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC in the dupilumab treatment groups (32%) compared to 
the placebo group (24.8%), serious infections were reported in 0.5% of patients treated with 
dupilumab and 0% of patients treated with placebo. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with 
this information. This higher incidence was partly driven by TEAEs of COVID-19 (by PT: 3.3% for the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 6.2% for the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 0.9% for 
placebo group in Pool 2a) and Upper respiratory tract infection (by PT: 5.7% for the dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group and 2.5% for the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 1.7% for placebo group in Pool 2a).  
Regarding infection in general, on examination of both individual events and incidence in other SOCs 
no clear pattern or trend was observed related to infections, with most imbalances being stochastic 
and/or observed bi-directionally. The only exception was noted for COVID-19-related PTs, for which a 
cumulative analysis of all dupilumab data was performed by the MAH. This analysis did not show 
evidence of a causal association between Dupilumab and an increased risk of serious, severe or 
opportunistic infections. 
The largest differences in overall TEAE incidence in the dupilumab groups were seen in the age 
subgroup, with a higher incidence of TEAEs in adolescents than in adults, in particular for injection site 
reactions. However, there was no consistent pattern in the incidence and type of PTs across the 
treatment groups.  
Injection site swelling and Injection site bruising met the criteria for ADRs based on the safety pool 
results. Injection site reactions, including injection site swelling, are already identified ADRs for other 
approved indications for dupilumab. Injection site bruising has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No other ADRs were identified in the population of adolescents and adults with EoE.  
Results in Pool 2b showed a similar safety profile to Pool 2a. The clinical laboratory results in Pool 2a 
were generally without clinically meaningful findings. Results from Pool 2b and the extended active 
treatment period (Part A/C) were consistent with the Pool 2a results. However, in other dupilumab 
indications (AD, asthma, CRSwNP), transient increases from baseline in mean blood eosinophil counts 
have been observed in dupilumab-treated participants, which returned towards baseline levels by the 
end of the treatment period. In contrast, in EoE participants treated with dupilumab, small decreases 
from baseline in mean/median blood eosinophil counts were observed, which were further discussed by 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 164/179 
 
 
 
 
the MAH. It was agreed that the differences in mean blood eosinophil levels observed across different 
indications are clinically not meaningful and mostly transient. 
Supportive study R668-EE-1324 
In Study R668-EE-1324 safety was evaluated in 23 patients who received at least 1 dose of dupilumab 
compared to 24 patients who received at least 1 dose of placebo. Overall, the safety profile reported 
for dupilumab at 300 mg SC QW administered was comparable to that of the placebo-treated patients. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in the dupilumab group were 78.3% and 62.5% in the placebo group. 
The most common TEAEs in the dupilumab-treated patients were Injection Site Erythema (very high 
compared to placebo: 34.8% versus 8.3% for placebo), Injection Site Inflammation and Injection Site 
Rash (13.0% versus 0 for placebo for both PTs), Injection Site Urticarial (8.7% versus 0 for placebo), 
Nasopharyngitis (17.4% versus 4.2% for placebo), and Pain in Extremity (8.7% versus 0 for placebo). 
No patient in either treatment group experienced an SAE during the 12-week treatment period. Three 
patients in the dupilumab group experienced 3 SAEs (Blood Creatine Phosphokinase Increased, 
Abortion Spontaneous, and Food Allergy) during the follow-up period, which were all assessed by the 
investigator as not related to the study drug and all events resolved. One patient in the dupilumab 
group experienced a TEAE (Nail Disorder) that led to permanent discontinuation of study but was not 
related to the study drug. 
Overall, the safety data reported for study R668-EE-1324 are in line with the results seen in Study 
R668-EE-1774. Injection site reactions were the most frequent reported TEAEs. Severe Adverse Events 
were not reported during the 12-week treatment period and the 3 SAEs reported during the follow-up 
period were not related to study drug. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Overall, 64 adolescents were included in the Pool 2A analyses (35 in the placebo, 27 in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W and 37 in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group). 
In the Pool 2a subgroup analysis by age group, in both dupilumab 300 mg treatment groups the 
incidence of TEAEs was higher in the adolescent cohort versus the adult cohort (dupilumab 300 mg 
QW: 94.6% of adolescents versus 80.0% of adults; dupilumab 300 mg Q2W: 85.2% of adolescents 
versus 74.1% of adults). In the placebo group, the difference in incidence of TEAEs was less marked 
(80.0% of adolescents versus 72.0% of adults).  
In both age groups, the SOC with the highest incidence of TEAEs across all treatment groups was 
General disorders and administration site conditions. Within the adolescent subgroup, the incidence of 
TEAEs in this SOC was similar across the treatment groups with the lowest incidence of 51.4% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group and placebo group and the highest incidence of 59.3% in the Q2W 
group. The PT Injection site reaction was by far the most common PT across all treatment groups in 
the adolescent subgroup, with the highest incidence of 40.0% in the placebo group compared to 
32.4% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group and 33.3% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. Within 
the adult subgroup, the incidence in this SOC was lower versus adolescents and there was more 
variability, with the lowest incidence in the placebo group (35.4%) and the highest in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W group (55.6%). 
The SOC with the next highest incidence in the dupilumab groups was Infections and infestations. In 
both age subgroups, the lowest incidence was seen in the placebo group (28.6% in the adolescent 
subgroup and 23.2% in the adult subgroup). In the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, the incidences were 
35.1% in adolescents and 30.6% in adults, and in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group 33.3% and 
31.5%, respectively. There was no individual PT driving the differences. There was no apparent 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

difference in the pattern of TEAEs between adults and adolescents. In the SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders, the incidence was similar across both age subgroups and across treatment groups (between 
20.0% and 27.8%), except for the adolescent placebo group with an incidence of 37.1%. There was no 
individual PT identified driving this difference. 
In the SOCs Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, within the adolescent subgroup the incidences of TEAEs in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group were higher versus placebo with 25.9% compared to 17.1% in the placebo group for 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and 33.3% compared to 11.4% for Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders. However, the incidence in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group was lower 
versus placebo (16.2% and 2.7% for the 2 SOCs, respectively). 
In Part A/C data from only 10 adolescent participants through week 52 were available. Of these 80% 
reported at least one TEAE. The SOC with the highest incidence of TEAEs across all treatment groups 
was General disorders and administration site conditions with 50%.  
At the CHMP request, in addition to the data from 10 EoE adolescent participants who completed 52 
weeks on dupilumab 300 mg every week (QW) in Study Part A/C, the MAH submitted the additional 
data from a further 75 adolescent participants who completed study Parts B and C (Part B/C). These 
additional data include 24 adolescents who completed 52 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg QW and 
generally confirm the safety profile seen in adolescents in study parts A, B and A/C. 
Overall, TEAEs were reported in 70.7% of adolescent participants, which was slightly higher than in the 
adult population with 65.1%. The proportion of adolescent participants who experienced a TEAE was 
similar across the treatment groups, ranging from 69.2% (18/26) in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 70.0% (7/10) in the placebo/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 
70.8% (17/24) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW/dupilumab 300 mg QW group, to 73.3% (11/15) in the 
placebo/dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group. The difference is most noticeable in the arms that switched 
from placebo in Part B to dupilumab (either QW or Q2W) in Part C. In those arms receiving dupilumab 
for the first time, 55.1% of the adults reported a TEAE versus 72% of the adolescents. By contrast in 
the arms that continued their dupilumab dose into Part C from Part B (QW or Q2W), there is not such a 
discernible difference in overall TEAE rates between adolescents and adults (70% in adolescents v 
69.9% in adults). 
In Part B/C the most commonly affected SOC in adolescents was General disorders and administration 
site conditions. Overall, the proportion of adolescent participants with TEAEs in this SOC was 33.3%, 
similar to adults in which the proportion was 30.3%. This SOC incidence was mostly driven by various 
injection site reaction PTs including injection site reaction (17.3%), injection site pain (10.7%), 
injection site erythema (5.3%), and injection site swelling (5.3%). The next most common TEAE 
grouping seen in adolescents was Infections and Infestations- overall 29.3% of adolescents (most 
commonly COVID19, followed by nasopharyngitis, followed by UTI) which is broadly similar to the 
overall rate seen in adults, 24.3%.  
The majority of TEAEs in adolescents were mild to moderate in intensity with low rates of severe TEAEs 
overall in adolescents, 2 overall (2.7%), compared to 2 in the adult group overall (1.3%). No TEAE 
deaths or SAEs leading to study drug discontinuation in adolescents were reported. One SAE was 
reported in adolescent participants (1.3% versus 2.6% in the adult cohort). The SAE was in an 
adolescent in the dupilumab 300mg QW/dupilumab 300mg QW group and the adolescent was 
hospitalised due to diarrhoea/rectal tenesmus and investigator assessed as unrelated to study drug. 
Overall, it is agreed that the safety profile in adolescents with EoE is generally similar to that of adults, 
although a slightly higher occurrence of TEAEs is observed, albeit that the additional TEAEs seem to fall 
into the mild to moderate category. Furthermore, the MAH reports literature that Injection Site 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 166/179 
 
 
 
 
Reactions (ISR) AEs are reported more frequently in childhood and adolescents than adults. The 
reporting rates of ISR fall during adult life, possibly due to higher tolerance to pain. This rationale can 
be followed.  
However, even with the B/C data, the numbers of adolescents compared to adults are still relatively 
low, making it difficult to compare the TEAE rates with certainty. In any case, it is agreed, that even if 
AEs are reported more frequently in adolescents, they are generally mild or moderate. 
The 300 mg QW dose of dupilumab has not been administered to adolescents outside of study R668-
EE-1774. 
In addition to the data from 10 adolescent eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) participants who completed 
52 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg every week (QW) in Study Part A/C, the MAH submitted the additional 
data from a further 75 adolescent participants who completed study Parts B and C (Part B/C) with the 
responses to the Request for Supplementary Information. These participant numbers are considered 
important especially in the context of a rare disease like EoE. These additional data include 24 
adolescents who completed 52 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg QW and generally confirm the safety 
profile seen in adolescents in study parts A, B and A/C. 
The additional data provided a more detailed view of the safety profile in adolescents and particularly 
of the longer-term use for up to one year.  
Additionally, the MAH has provided a high level break down of safety events in the 20 patients in the 
EoE studies that weighed 40-50kg and received 300mg weekly versus those weighing more than 50kg. 
The provided comparison of TEAEs rates and top line TEAE results from the AD and EoE studies do not 
signal any increase in toxicity in the 40-50kg weight band, versus those patients heavier than 50kg.  
Overall, it is agreed that the submitted data suggest that adolescents and adults of similar weights 
have similar exposures. While based on small numbers, and that definite conclusion cannot be drawn, 
it can  be agreed that lighter patients did not display an increased rate of TEAEs.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of the Dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen has already been evaluated in different trials 
for other indications in the dupilumab development program (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP). 
Approximately 3,000 participants have been exposed to dupilumab 300 mg QW mainly in the AD 
indication. No new safety signals associated with the use of dupilumab in participants with EoE were 
identified in this application. The overall safety profile was consistent with that seen in the other 
dupilumab indications.  
The SOC with the highest incidence of TEAEs across all treatment groups was General disorders and 
administration site conditions. Injection site swelling and Injection site bruising met the criteria for 
ADRs based on the safety pool results. Injection site reactions, including injection site swelling, are 
already identified ADRs for other approved indications for dupilumab. Injection site bruising has been 
added in section 4.8 of the SmPC as it was not observed for other indications. Although these TEAEs 
were of mild to moderate intensity, there was a high incidence especially in the adolescent 
participants.  
The rate of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events leading to discontinuation was low in all 
treatment groups and no clear pattern was identified indicating a relationship to the study treatment. 
Overall, the safety profile in adult participants is adequately evaluated and consistent with the safety 
profile of 300 mg QW reported in other indications.

In adolescent participants, the rates of TEAEs are higher in adolescents compared to the adults and 
most SAEs were reported in this age group. The safety data confirmed a broadly similar safety profile 
in adolescents with EoE to that seen in adults with EoE, even though slightly higher rates of TEAE are 
observed.

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, the sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes of the package leaflet are included in section 1 (EoE extension of indication), section 2 (to 
exclude children under 12 years of age), section 3 (300 mg given every week for patients ≥12 years 
old and with a bw ≥40 kg) and section 4 (commonly occurred side effect bruising). Neither a full user 
testing nor a bridging/ focus test are performed by the marketing authorisation holder, which is 
considered acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a serious, chronic, type 2 inflammatory, immune-mediated disease of 
the esophagus. The prevalence of EoE is estimated at 22.7 per 100,000 worldwide and has been 
increasing. Eosinophilic esophagitis has been reported in all ages. However, most cases are in children 
and adults younger than 50 years. 
The disease is characterized by type 2 inflammation with esophageal eosinophilia leading to symptoms 
of esophageal dysfunction. Growing evidence suggests that a type 2 cytokine-mediated immune 
response plays an important role in the development of EoE. Patients with EoE have increased levels of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 171/179 
 
 
 
 
 
esophageal inflammatory infiltrates, including eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils, as 
well as type 2-associated chemokines and cytokines, such as eotaxin-3, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and 
IL-13. Esophageal biopsies and blood samples of patients with active EoE have increased levels of the 
type 2 prototypical cytokines and chemokines including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Eosinophilic esophagitis 
is also distinguished by the expression of a unique esophageal transcriptome and the interplay of early 
life environmental factors with distinct genetic susceptibility elements at 5q22 (thymic and stromal 
lymphopoietin [TSLP]) and 2p23 (calpain 14 [CAPN14]). CAPN14 is overexpressed by the esophageal 
epithelia in patients with EoE and may account for the tissue specificity of esophageal disease in EoE 
because CAPN14 invokes a pathway that alters basic epithelial cell functions, including barrier 
integrity. 
The primary clinical manifestations of EoE in both adults and children over 10 years of age are 
dysphagia and food impaction. Other clinical manifestations such as heartburn, diarrhea and weight 
loss have also been reported. The symptoms lead to substantially impaired quality of life (QOL). Food 
impaction is a traumatic event for patients, and often requires medical intervention, including 
emergency room visits for manual removal to relieve the impaction. Eosinophilic esophagitis is the 
underlying cause of approximately 50% of the food impaction cases that present in the emergency 
department.  
Complications of EoE include food impaction, strictures, esophageal dysmotility, increased esophageal 
infections, aspiration, and spontaneous esophageal rupture. Food impaction can occur at any stage of 
the disease, either as an initial manifestation of EoE or after many years of EoE disease duration. 
Dysphagia, food impaction and regurgitation may increase the risk for aspiration, including aspiration 
pneumonia. Esophageal inflammation in EoE may also result in esophageal perforation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current therapeutic approaches include chronic dietary elimination, conventional medicinal therapies, 
and esophageal dilation. The combination of diet modification and conventional medicinal therapies 
(swallowed topical corticosteroid formulations like orodispersible budesonide (Jorveza) is approved in 
adults in the European Union and off-label proton-pump inhibitors) can be effective in the management 
of some patients with EoE. About 25% of patients may have significant ongoing symptoms, despite 
treatment with dietary modification and corticosteroids. Additionally, a significant portion of patients do 
not respond to corticosteroids, and those who do respond may not have sustained benefit, a critical 
limitation for this chronic disease. Furthermore, swallowed topical corticosteroids may have adverse 
reactions associated with systemic glucocorticoid absorption, including increased risk of Cushing’s 
syndrome, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children, muscle weakness and osteoporosis. 
Long-term use of PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and may 
be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. 
Endoscopic dilation can provide immediate relief but carries a risk (albeit low) of serious complications 
due to esophageal perforation and does not have any affect the underlying inflammatory pathology of 
EoE. 
Overall, the current available medicinal therapies for EoE are limited by variable response rates, 
variable symptom improvement, relapse after therapy cessation, failure to show sustained benefit, the 
potential for side effects and adverse effects on QoL. Therefore, an unmet need is seen for safe and 
effective treatment options that address the underlying inflammation of EoE to prevent the disease 
progression and improve clinical symptoms in adults and adolescents inadequately controlled by, 
intolerant to, or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study R668-EE-1774 was a randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, pivotal phase 3 study to 
evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab treatment compared with placebo in adult and adolescent patients 
with EoE. This study consisted of 3 parts. Part A and Part B consisted of a 24-week double-blind 
treatment period each, Part C of a 28-week extended active treatment period. A 12-week post 
treatment follow-up period followed at the end of Part C or at the end of Parts A or B for participants 
who did not enter Part C.  
Part A and Part B were carried out as 2 separate sequential independent parts and participants could 
only be enrolled in either Part A or Part B. Part A evaluated efficacy and safety of dupilumab 300 mg 
QW versus placebo. Part B evaluated efficacy and safety of dupilumab 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W 
versus placebo. Participants were stratified by age (≥18 years versus ≥12 to <18 years of age) and 
use of PPI at randomization. 
Part C of Study R668-EE-1774 extended the treatment period for an additional 28 weeks. All 
participants who entered Part C from Part A were administered dupilumab 300 mg SC QW for 28 weeks 
during Part C. Participants who entered Part C from Part B were administered either dupilumab 300 mg 
SC QW or dupilumab 300 mg SC Q2W for 28 weeks during Part C. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The co-primary endpoint in Part A and B were Proportion of Participants Achieving Peak Esophageal 
Intraepithelial Eosinophil Count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 and Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ 
Total Score at week 24.   
The results of Part A show that the proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was significantly greater in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW group (59.55%) compared to the placebo group (5.1%). The results from the other co-primary 
endpoint showed an improvement in DSQ total score compared to placebo at week 24. The reduction 
from baseline in DSQ total score at week 24 was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (-21.92 
points) versus the placebo group (-9.60 points). The results of the secondary endpoints evaluated 
show consistent improvement of EoE disease symptoms and health-related quality-of-life measures 
consistent with results of the primary endpoints.  
In Part B, Dupilumab 300 mg QW demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement over placebo in the 
co-primary and secondary endpoints. The proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
(58.8%) compared to placebo (6.3%). Higher improvement from baseline in DSQ total score at week 
24 was seen in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (−23.78 points) compared to placebo (−13.86 
points). The results of the high number of secondary endpoints also show greater improvement of EoE 
disease symptoms and health-related quality-of-life measures with Dupilumab 300 mg QW compared 
to placebo.  
At the end of the Part A/C treatment period, more than half (57.8%) of participants achieved a peak 
esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf. Of participants receiving dupilumab 300 mg QW in 
Part A and C, 68.4% had histological remission at the Part C baseline (end of Part A) and 55.9% at 
week 52 (end of Part C). Of participants previously treated with placebo in Part A, 60.0% achieved a 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf after 28 weeks of dupilumab treatment in Part 
C (week 52), which is similar to the proportion of participants treated with dupilumab during Part A. 
Furthermore, participants receiving the 300 mg QW dosing regimen continued to improve during Part 
C. While 58.8% of participants in Part B had achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 173/179 
 
 
 
 
≤6/hpf at Week 24 on dupilumab 300 mg QW, 84.6% had achieved this after 52 weeks. Similarly, DSQ 
scores continued to improve in Part B participants treated with dupilumab 300 mg QW from -23.78 at 
24 weeks to -30.26 at 52 weeks. Participants who received placebo in Part B achieved improvements 
after 28 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg QW in Part C similar to those observed for participants who 
received 24 weeks of dupilumab treatment during Part B. 
In conclusion, the results reported for the Dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen administered in 
Study R668-EE-1771 show clinically meaningful improvements of signs and symptoms in patients with 
EoE measured by the co-primary endpoints `Proportion of participants who achieved peak esophageal 
intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24´ and `Absolute Change from Baseline in DSQ 
Total Score at week 24´ compared to placebo. Consistent results are seen for the high number of 
secondary endpoints showing improvements of EoE disease symptoms, health-related quality-of-life 
measures and histologic, endoscopic and molecular endpoints.  
Similar results were seen in the adolescent subgroup. In Pool 1, the Co-Primary endpoints were 
analysed by age. The results show that in the ≥12 to <18 years of age group, the proportion of 
participants who achieved peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 was 
19/37 (51.4%) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group versus 2/35 (5.7%) in the placebo group. In the 
≥12 to <18 years of age group, the improvement in DSQ total score from baseline to week 24 was -
21.07 points in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (n=37) and -17.23 points in the placebo group 
(n=35). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No patients weighting less than 40kg were included in the study R668-EE-1774. Therefore as no 
clinical experience is available for this weight group, the MAH decided to exclude this group from the 
indication.  
In Part B of study R668-EE-1774 the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W showed similar results in the proportion 
of patient achieving a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf to the 300 mg QW dose 
but the change in the DSQ score was only similar to placebo in adults and even lower in adolescents. 
As the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W regimen achieved similar efficacy to the 300 mg QW regimen with 
respect to reducing eosinophilic infiltration to the esophagus, the cause of failure of the 300 mg Q2W 
regimen to achieve efficacy on reducing dysphagia is not likely due to insufficient drug distribution to 
the esophageal mucosa. These results suggest that reducing eosinophilic infiltration to the esophageal 
mucosa may be necessary but insufficient to achieve improvement in symptoms of EoE such as 
dysphagia. The reason for the different results for the co-primary endpoint between the dupilumab 300 
mg QW and 300 mg Q2W regimens remains unclear. One hypothesis is that in addition to the effect on 
infiltration of eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa, the drug effect on dysphagia may be modulated 
by a different effect compartment (e.g., muscularis layer, esophageal nervous plexus). Similarly, the 
results from 227 out of 240 Part B participants who entered Part C (Part B/C) show that numerically 
greater effects in all endpoints were observed in participants who had been treated with dupilumab 
300 mg QW for 52 weeks compared with those treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W.  
Although it can be agreed that the data from B/C indicate that continued use for up to one year was 
generally well tolerated it remains unclear whether a frequency of weekly dosing is required after a 
patient achieves remission, or after one year of therapy. The weekly dosing is a considerable disease 
burden, which might not be tolerated by all patients for long term use. Therefore, at the CHMP 
request, the MAH added in section 4.2 of the SmPC that dosing beyond 52 weeks has not been 
studied.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of Injection Site Reaction reported in all Parts of Study R668-EE-1774 and in Study 
R668-EE-1324 is high in the EoE population. Pool 2a shows that there is a high difference in the PT of 
injection site swelling between dupilumab the 300 mg QW and Placebo. In the supportive study R668-
EE-1324 the most common TEAEs in the dupilumab-treated patients were Injection Site Erythema. The 
incidence was very high in the dupilumab treated patients: 34.8% compared to 8.3% for placebo. 
Injection site reactions have previously been identified as common ADRs in other dupilumab 
indications (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP). Injection site bruising has been added in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Although, the reactions were mild to moderate in intensity, the high incidence could impair the 
compliance of patients, especially in the younger age group. 
A higher incidence of TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was reported in the dupilumab 
treatment groups (32%) compared to the placebo group (24.8%), serious infections were reported in 
0.5% of patients treated with dupilumab and 0% of patients treated with placebo. Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has been updated with this information. 
In the subgroup analysis by age group, in both dupilumab 300 mg treatment groups the incidence of 
TEAEs was higher in the adolescent cohort versus the adult cohort (QW: 92.3% of adolescents versus 
79.6% of adults; Q2W: 85.2% of adolescents versus 74.1% of adults). In the placebo group, the 
incidence of TEAEs was similar (73.1% of adolescents and 69.2% of adults). 
Five out of seven SAEs in Part B were reported in adolescents up to week 24, of which 4 SAEs occurred 
in dupilumab 300 mg QW treated adolescents. Of note, only 26 of the 161 of the dupilumab treated 
participants in this study part were adolescents, this higher incidence of SAEs in this age group was 
further explored. None of the SAEs was considered related to dupilumab by Investigators as all 
participants had alternate aetiologies and/or risk factors in past medical history. Furthermore, no 
pattern could be identified and none led to treatment discontinuation. 
In Part B/C a slightly higher rate of TEAEs was reported for adolescents (70%) compared to adults 
(65%), a trend similar to results in Part A, B and A/C. The difference is most noticeable in the arms 
that switched from placebo in Part B to dupilumab (either QW or Q2W) in Part C. In those arms 
receiving dupilumab for the first time, 55.1% of the adults reported a TEAE versus 72% of the 
adolescents. By contrast in the arms that continued their dupilumab dose into Part C from Part B (QW 
or Q2W), there is not such a discernible difference in overall TEAE rates between adolescents and 
adults (70% in adolescents vs 69.9% in adults). 
In conclusion no new safety signals associated with the use of dupilumab in participants with EoE were 
identified. The overall safety profile was consistent with that seen in other indications in the dupilumab 
development program (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Most of the TEAEs reported were of mild or moderate intensity. The high incidence of the TEAEs was 
mainly driven by injection site reactions. No specific pattern of PTs was identified. 
The 300 mg dose has not been administered to adolescents outside of the pivotal study. Although 
additional safety data from 75 adolescents have been submitted during the evaluation, the number of 
adolescent participants, who received the dupilumab 300 mg QW through week 52 is still relatively 
limited. These additional data included 24 adolescents who completed 52 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg 
QW in study part B/C, (in addition to the data from the 10 adolescents who completed 52 weeks on 
dupilumab 300 mg QW in Study Part A/C). This makes the comparison of the TEAE rates of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/6467/2023  
Page 175/179 
 
 
 
 
adolescents vs adults difficult to conclude for the intended indication. However, it has to be taken into 
account that Eosinophilic Esophagitis is defined as a rare disease. 
As no data are available beyond 52 weeks; this has been adequately mentioned in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results from the co-primary endpoints and secondary endpoints of Part A and Part B of Study 
R668-EE-1774 show clinically meaningful improvements with dupilumab 300 mg QW treatment in 
signs and symptoms of EoE after 24 weeks of treatment. The proportion of participants who achieved 
peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6 eos/hpf, which indicates reduced esophageal 
inflammation was significantly greater in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group compared to the placebo 
group. Additionally, the dupilumab 300 mg QW group also showed a reduction (improvement) in the 
DSQ (Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire) total score compared to placebo. Furthermore, at the end of 
Part A/C after 52 weeks of treatment the participants on dupilumab 300 mg QW mostly sustained the 
improvement seen at week 24 in histological reduction of intraepithelial eosinophilic infiltration as well 
as reduced clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (dysphagia). 
However, in Part B of study R668-EE-1774 the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W showed similar results in the 
proportion of patient achieving a peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤6/hpf to the 300 mg 
QW dose but the change in the DSQ score was only similar to placebo in adults and even lower in 
adolescents. 
Both endpoints are relevant in determining the efficacy of dupilumab in EoE. The 300 mg QW dose met 
its endpoints and showed continued improvement in adult and adolescent participants with EoE in both 
histologic and clinical efficacy endpoints up to week 52 with acceptable safety profile similar to other 
approved indications. This is the proposed dose regimen for adult and adolescent patients with EoE. 
Injection site reactions have previously been identified as common ADRs in other dupilumab 
indications (AD, asthma, and CRSwNP). Injection site bruising has been added in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Although, the reactions were mild to moderate in intensity, the high incidence could impair the 
compliance of patients, especially in the younger age group.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The beneficial effects of Dupilumab 300 mg QW has been shown in all parts of study R668-EE-1774 
showing meaningful improvements across all histologic, clinical, endoscopic, QoL, and molecular 
signature of gene expression in EoE endpoints in adult. In adolescent participants similar 
improvements were reported with the Dupilumab 300 mg QW.  
However, the numbers of adolescents compared to adults are still relatively low, making it difficult to 
fully characterise the safety profile and to compare the TEAE rates with certainty. Although the rate of 
TEAEs was high, most events were mild or moderate in intensity. The rate of SAEs was low and no new 
safety risks compared to other indication were identified. Of note the safety profile of Dupilumab 300 
mg QW has already been evaluated in adult and adolescent participants in other indications, mainly in 
Atopic Dermatitis.  It will be further characterised in the post authorisation setting, especially for the 
paediatric population given the limited data available in this relatively rare condition. 
The benefit-risk ratio for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with EoE is considered positive 
for the dupilumab 300 mg QW dosing regimen.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dupixent is positive in the following indication: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents 12 years 
and older, weighing at least 40 kg, who are inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to, or who are 
not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy (see section 5.1).

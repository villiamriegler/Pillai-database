1.  Assessment 
Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Submission of study X06-MMRV-302 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
This stand alone study is an open, randomised, comparative, multicentre study to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and safety of concomitant versus separate administration of a combined measles, 
mumps, rubella and varicella live vaccine (ProQuad) and a booster dose of Infanrix hexa in healthy 
children 12 to 23 months of age. 
Assessment 
In Europe, there are 2 main immunisation schedules for hexavalent vaccines: 
1.  a primary series with two doses during the first year of life and a booster dose during the second 
year of life (e.g. in Italy with 2 doses at 3 and 5 months of age plus a booster dose at 11 to 13 
months of age); or 
2.  a primary series of three doses during the first year of life and a booster dose during the second 
year of life (e.g. in Germany with 3 doses at 2, 3 and 4 months of age plus a booster dose at 11 to 
14 months of age). 
ProQuad, a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, should be given to individuals 
from the age of 12 months onwards. Infants should receive two doses and the second dose should be 
given at least one month after the second dose. 
The purpose of study X06-MMRV-302 was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant 
versus separate administration of a first dose of ProQuad and a booster dose of Infanrix hexa in 
healthy children 12 to 23 months of age.   
Study design 
Study X06-MMRV-302 is an open, randomised, comparative, multicentre phase 3b study and was 
conducted in 51 study centres in Italy and Germany from January 2007 (FVFS) to March 2008 (LVLS). 
In this study 960 subjects were planned to be enrolled. Subjects were randomised in a 2:1:1 ratio to 
receive: 
•  Group 1: A first dose of ProQuad concomitantly with a booster dose of Infanrix hexa 
•  Group 2: A first dose of ProQuad 
•  Group 3: A booster dose of Infanrix hexa. 
Initially, it was planned to have the same number of subjects recruited in Italy and Germany. 
However, the protocol was amended allowing competitive recruitment between the 2 countries in order 
to ensure the best recruitment rate and the achievement of the global targeted included population.

16.  Any recent (=<30 days) participation or scheduled participation in any other clinical trial through 
Visit 2. 
Treatments 
Two visits were scheduled during the follow-up period of the study: at Day 0 (Visit 1, vaccination day), 
and at Day 42 (Visit 2, 42 to 56 days after vaccination). At Visit 1 subjects received either ProQuad 
concomitantly with Infanrix hexa booster (Group 1) or ProQuad alone (Group 2) or Infanrix hexa 
booster alone (Group 3). ProQuad had to be injected by sub-cutaneous route of administration and 
Infanrix hexa had to be injected by intra-muscular route of administration. In Group 1, the injection of 
ProQuad had to be done in the contra-lateral arm than the one for Infanrix hexa. 
The test vaccines were ProQuad batches 652834 and NF56400 and Infanrix hexa batch no A21CA244A. 
The three vaccine batches were used in both countries. 
The timing of blood samples and the planned immunogenicity evaluation is summarised in table 1.

Study objectives and hypotheses 
The primary study objective was to demonstrate that ProQuad can be administered concomitantly 
with a booster dose of Infanrix hexa to healthy children of 12 to 23 months of age without impairing 
the antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Hep B and Haemophilus influenzae 
type b (Hib), nor to the 3 pertussis antibody titres measured at 42 days following vaccination. 
In relation to the primary objective of the study, the following hypotheses were tested. 
−  The non-inferiority of Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) compared to Group 2 (ProQuad alone) 
was tested for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella as follows: the Group 1 response rates were 
considered non-inferior to the Group 2 response rates if, for each valence, the two-sided 95% 
Confidence Interval (CI) around the difference in response rates (Group 1 – Group 2) excluded a 
decrease of 10% or more (i.e. the non-inferiority margin), 
−  The non-inferiority of Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) compared to Group 3 (Infanrix hexa 
alone) was tested for Hep B and Hib as follows: the Group 1 response rates were considered non-
inferior to the Group 3 response rates if, for each valence, the two-sided 95% CI around the 
difference in response rates (Group 1 – Group 3) excluded a decrease of 5% or more (i.e. the non-
inferiority margin),

−  The non-inferiority of Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) compared to Group 3 (Infanrix hexa 
alone) was tested for pertussis (PT, FHA and PRN) as follows: the Group 1 antibody titres were 
considered non-inferior to the Group 3 antibody titres if, for each valence (PT, FHA and PRN), the 
two-sided 95% CI around the ratio of post-vaccination GMT (Group 1/Group 3) excluded a 
decrease of 2-fold or more (i.e. the non-inferiority margin).  
Assessor’s comment:  
The concomitant use of ProQuad and Infanrix hexa is proposed at the time of the first immunisation of 
the 2-dose schedule of ProQuad and a booster vaccination for Infanrix hexa. Consequently different 
non-inferiority margins are defined for the response rates against the various antigens. The non-
inferiority margin of 10% defined for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella and the margin of 5% for 
Hep B and Hib are acceptable. Moreover a non-inferiority margin for pertussis excluding a two fold 
decrease or more is appropriately defined.   
The statistical analysis for the demonstration of the non-inferiority of response rates used stratification 
by region (i.e. centres or pooled centres based on geographic location) with a weight proportional to 
the number of subjects within each region. The statistical analysis for the demonstration of the non-
inferiority of pertussis titres was based on an ANCOVA model with the log-transformed post vaccination 
titres as response, the log-transformed baseline titres as covariate, the Infanrix hexa primary series 
schedule, the Region (nested effect) and the Group as fixed effects. 
The secondary study objectives were  
−  To describe the antibody titres and the antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella, 
varicella, D, T, P, Hep B, IPV and Hib as measured at 42 days following vaccination when 
administered to healthy children 12 to 23 months of age, by Infanrix hexa primary vaccination 
schedule and all data pooled. 
−  To evaluate the safety profile of ProQuad when administered concomitantly with a booster dose of 
Infanrix hexa to healthy children 12 to 23 months of age, by Infanrix hexa primary vaccination 
schedule and all data pooled. 
Immunogenicity - secondary objectives analyses 
Descriptive statistics were provided by Infanrix hexa primary vaccination schedule and all data pooled 
for: 
−  Me, Mu, Ru, Va antibody GMT (and 95% CIs) in Group 1 and Group 2, 
−  Rates (and 95% CIs) of subjects with varicella antibody titres >=1.25 gpELISA units/mL in 
subjects seronegative at baseline, 
−  D, T, and IPV response rates (and 95% CIs) in Group 1 and Group 3, 
−  D, T, P, Hep B, IPV, and Hib antibody GMT (and 95% CIs) in Group 1 and Group 3,  
−  Pertussis response rates (and 95% CIs) and GMTR (and 95% CIs) in Group 1 and Group 3.

−  Global safety profile (i.e. injection-site adverse reactions, systemic adverse events and 
temperature) in all groups, 
−  Specific safety profile (i.e. rashes of interest and mumps-like illness).

One centre was excluded from analyses due to a major GCP non compliance (non reliability of 
vaccination history). The centre had randomized 14 subjects, who were not replaced. Therefore the 
total number of subjects included in the analysis is less than the number of subjects planned to be 
enrolled in the study. 
The analysis sets of subjects defined for the study is shown in Table 3. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of 933 subjects (97.7%) in total and the Per Protocol Set (PPS) 
consisted of 869 subjects (91.0%).

Table 3.  Analysis sets  
The three study groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, height, and weight at baseline. The 
mean (+/-SD) age at vaccination was 13.5 (+/-1.7) months and the gender distribution was 53.1% 
male and 46.9% female. The results in Italy and Germany were comparable. 
Immunogenicity evaluation  
Antibody response rates and GMTs to measles, mumps rubella and varicella 
The results for antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at 6 weeks post 
vaccination and the non-inferiority analysis are summarised in Table 4.  
For group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) and group 2 (ProQuad alone), the antibody response rates to 
measles, mumps, rubella and varicella were ≥ 95.1% post dose 1 in the antigen-specific PPS for 
measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, respectively. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for each 
component of ProQuad.

vaccination of initially seronegative subjects with ProQuad and non-inferiority analysis – (PPS) 
GMTs to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella were numerically comparable in group 1 and group 2 six 
weeks after the first dose of ProQuad (Table 5). 
Table 5. 
Table 5: GMTs to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella 6 weeks after vaccination of 
initially seronegative subjects with ProQuad– PPS 
Assessor’s comment:  
The  response  rates  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella  and  varicella  were  comparable  and  found  to  be 
noninferior  whether  a  first  dose  of  ProQuad  was  given  concomitantly  with  a  booster  dose  of  Infanrix 
hexa or given alone. Comparable antibody levels were elicited against all live virus components. 
Antibody response rates to Hep B and Hib 
The results for antibody response rates to Hep B and Hib and the non-inferiority analysis stratified by 
region are summarised in Table 6. 
Assessment report under article 46  
EMA/644797/2014  
Page 8/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) and group 3 (Infanrix hexa alone), the antibody response rates 
to Hep B and Hib were ≥ 95.3% 6 weeks after vaccination with Infanrix hexa in the PPS. Non-
inferiority was achieved since the lower bound of the two-side 95% CI was greater than 5%. 
Table 6. 
Table 6: Antibody response rates to Hep B and Hib 6 weeks after vaccination with 
Infanrix hexa and non-inferiority analysis – PPS 
It should be noted that the response rates for Hib in Germany (3+1 schedule) following the 
administration of Infanrix hexa alone (94.5%) was numerically lower compared to ProQuad + Infanrix 
hexa (98.7%), resulting in a rate difference [95% CI] of 3.89% [0.64; 8.67] in Germany (Table 7). In 
contrast the two groups were comparable in Italy.

Assessor's comment:  
Like  in  other  studies  evaluating  the  concomitant  administration  of  Infanrix  hexa  with  a  second 
childhood  vaccine  (e.g.  pneumococcal  vaccine)  the  4th  dose  of  Infanrix  hexa  was  found  to  elicit  a 
stronger  antibody  response  against  Hib  antigens  when  given  concomitantly.  This  difference  was  not 
seen  for  prior  doses  and  might  explain  the  differences  seen  here  as  well  between  the  German  (4th 
dose)  and  the  Italian  (3rd  dose)  subjects.  As  a  higher  titre  is  not  considered  a  clinical  issue,  this 
observation needs not to be followed up. 
GMT for pertussis 
The post-vaccination GMT for pertussis are summarised in Table 8 as well as the non-inferiority 
analysis adjusted for pre-vaccination titres, Infanrix hexa primary vaccination and region. 
For Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) and Group 3 (Infanrix hexa alone), the postvaccination GMT for 
the 3 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, and PRN) were comparable and non-inferiority was shown. 
Table 8. 
Table 8: Summary and non-inferiority analysis (adjusted for pre-vaccination titres, 
Infanrix hexa primary vaccination and region) of antibody titres to pertussis 6 weeks after 
vaccination with Infanrix hexa – PPS 
Of note is the difference in GMTs in Italy and Germany. In Germany the anti-PRN and anti FHA GMT 
were numerically lower following the administration of Infanrix hexa alone than after concomitant 
administration, while comparable titres were observed in Italy (Table 9).

Assessor's comment:  
The primary objectives of this study were met.  Concomitant administration of the first dose of 
ProQuad with a booster dose of Infanrix hexa elicits an immune response against measles, mumps, 
rubella, varicella, HepB, Hib and pertussis that is noninferior to the administration of ProQuad or 
Infanrix hexa alone. The results of the FAS were comparable to those on the PPS. 
In general higher antibody titers and response rates were observed following concomitant 
administration compared to administration of the vaccines alone indicating that there is no negative 
immunological interference following concomitant administration of these two vaccines. 
Response rates and antibody GMT for diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis types 1, 2, and 3 
The response rates at 6 weeks post-vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis types 1, 2 and 
3 in group 1 and group 3 were numerically comparable for the PPS and they were comparable for both 
immunisation schedules routinely used in Italy and Germany. 
Seroprotection rates increased similarly following vaccination in both Group 1 and Group 3: 
• 
• 
• 
For diphtheria (titre ≥0.1 IU/mL) from 59 - 62% prevaccination to ≥99.7% postvaccination 
For tetanus, (titre ≥0.1 IU/mL) from 93 - 94% prevaccination to 100% postvaccination 
For poliomyelitis types 1, 2 and 3 (titre ≥8 (1/dil) from 94 - 97% prevaccination to ≥99.5% 
postvaccination. 
Assessor's comment:  
The response rates and antibody titres for diphtheria, tetanus and polio virus type 1, 2 and 3 were 
comparable in both groups and reached nearly 100% for all components. 
Safety evaluation  
The following safety evaluation does not include site 32, because data from site 32 have been excluded 
due to fraud. 
Among the 955 randomised subjects, 8 were not part of the Safety Analysis Set because they were not 
vaccinated at all (n=3) or withdrew prematurely before providing any safety information (n=5, 
subjects 07012, 34001 and 34005 in Group 1, 21019 in Group 2 and 14034 in Group 3). Therefore the 
Safety Analysis Set consisted of 947 subjects (99.2%). An overview of the subjects, who received the 
vaccines, is given in table 10. 
Table 10.  Table 10: Overview of randomized subjects 
Assessment report under article 46  
EMA/644797/2014  
Page 11/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were 2 errors regarding vaccination schedule not respecting randomisation affecting the safety 
analysis: 
−  Subject 42001 was randomised in Group 3 but vaccinated according to Group 2 schedule and was 
analysed for safety according to actual vaccination (i.e., in Group 2). 
−  Subject 51001 was randomised in Group 2 but vaccinated according to Group 3 schedule and was 
analysed for safety according to actual route (i.e., in Group 3). 
Consequently, the Safety Analyses Sets consisted of 474 subjects in Group 1, 234 subjects in Group 2 
and 239 subjects in Group 3. 
A summary of the safety measurements performed in the study is presented in table 11. 
Table 11.  Table 11: Safety measurement and timing 
Intensity of an adverse event 
For injection-site adverse reactions and systemic adverse events, intensity was: 
• 
For measurable injection-site adverse reactions, the maximum largest diameter in cm. 
The 4 classes of measurable lesions were defined as follows: ≤ 2.5 cm, 2.5–5.0 cm, 5.0–7.5 cm, > 7.5 
cm  
• 
For systemic adverse events and non-measurable injection-site reactions, the maximum intensity 
observed: 
−  mild: awareness of sign and symptom but easily tolerated 
−  moderate: definitely acting like something is wrong 
− 
severe: extremely distressed or unable to do usual activity. 
• 
For fever, the highest observed temperature measured in degrees Celsius. 
•  Measles-, rubella-, varicella- and zoster-like rashes and mumps-like symptoms 
Assessment report under article 46

In case of measles-, rubella-, varicella- or zoster-like rashes (injection-site or non-injection site) or in 
case of symptoms resembling mumps occurring from Day 0 to Day 28, as described in the Diary Card, 
the parent(s) or legal representative were instructed to immediately contact the investigator. In this 
event, the subject was examined by the investigator as soon as possible but no later than 72 hours 
(i.e. 3 days) following the onset of the symptoms. 
Rashes were recorded on module “Rashes” of the Diary Cards. The clinical findings and the subject’s 
history of exposure to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and/or zoster were documented directly by 
the investigator into the e-CRF and in the subject’s source document. 
Mumps-like symptoms like swollen parotid were recorded as a systemic adverse event. 
Immediate systemic adverse events (i.e. occurring in the first 20 minutes following vaccination) were 
recorded directly by the investigator into the e-CRF and in the subject’s source document. 
Systemic adverse events occurring from Day 0 (20 minutes following vaccination) to Day 28 were 
recorded in the Diary Card. Systemic adverse events were all spontaneously reported. 
Adverse events and serious adverse events (e.g. hospitalisation) and visits to a physician occurring 
from Day 0 to Visit 2 were recorded in the Diary Card, either as an injection-site adverse reaction or as 
a systemic adverse event. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Study X06-MMRV-302 was well designed and well conducted. Around 99.2 % of the children continued 
the study till the end, which is a high percentage for this age group. 
Safety Results: 
Thus, the Safety Analysis Set consisted of 947 subjects, including 474 subjects in group 1, 234 
subjects in group 2 and 239 subjects in group 3. 
Overall, 90.5%, 72.6% and 84.1% of subjects reported at least one injection-site adverse reaction or 
systemic adverse event from Day 0 to Day 28 after vaccination, in group 1 (Infanrix hexa + ProQuad), 
group 2 (ProQuad alone) and group 3 (Infanrix hexa alone), respectively. 
A global summary of safety is given in tables 12, 13 and 14. 
Within the observation period from Day 0 to Day 28 a comparable percentage of subjects reported at 
least one injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event related to Infanrix hexa (Table 12). 
In group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) 71.9% reported adverse reactions and in group 3 (Infanrix hexa 
alone) 69.5% of subjects experienced adverse reaction. In contrast, more subjects reported injection-
site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event related to ProQuad in group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix 
hexa) compared to Group 2 (ProQuad alone) (54.4% and 46.6%, respectively).

Assessor’s comment 
The data indicate that solicited injection site reactions are mainly caused by the vaccine Infanrix hexa. 
As shown in table 13 solicited injection site adverse reactions (erythema, pain and swelling) to 
ProQuad from Day 0 to Day 4 were reported by more subjects in Group 1 compared to Group 2 
(31.6% and 19.7%, respectively), while those to Infanrix hexa were reported by a comparable number 
of subjects in Group 1 and Group 3 (65.4% and 65.3%). 
From Day 0 to Day 28, a comparable proportion of subjects experienced unsolicited injection site 
adverse reactions to ProQuad (8.2% in Group 1 and 9.0% in Group 2) and to Infanrix hexa (5.7% in 
Group 1 and 3.3% in Group 3).  
From Day 0 to Day 28 a comparable proportion of subjects in each group reported systemic adverse 
events related to ProQuad (32.1% in Group 1 and 29.5% in Group 2) and related to Infanrix hexa 
(21.1% in Group 1 and 16.7% in Group 3). 
From Day 0 to Day 28, injection-site rashes of interest were reported by 3.0% of subjects in Group 1, 
4.3% in Group 2 and 0.8% in Group 3. 
A total of 64 (13.5%) and 24 (10.3%) subjects reported non-injection-site rashes of interest in Group 
1 and Group 2, respectively. Neither mumps nor mumps-like illness was reported in this study (Table 
13).

Table 14.  Global summary of safety - part 3 
Assessor’s Comment: 
Number of systemic reactions including high body temperature were comparable in all three treatment 
groups,  thus,  concomitant  use  of  ProQuad  with  Infanrix  hexa  does  not  seem  to  raise  any  safety 
concerns.  In  regards  to  local  reactions  (pain,  erythema  and  swelling)  a  clear  trend  of  higher 
reactogenicity is seen in the concomitant administration in comparison to the single administration of 
ProQuad.  Comparing  the  local  reactions  in  regards  to  concomitant  administration  and  single 
administration  of  Infanrix  hexa  the  percentage  of  reactogenicity  is  comparable  in  both  treatment 
groups. 
Serious adverse events between Day 0 and Visit 2 
From Day 0 to Visit 2, a total of 19 serious adverse events were reported by 17 subjects. Eight serious 
adverse events were reported by 7 subjects (1.5%) in Group 1, 7 serious adverse events were 
reported by 6 subjects (2.6%) in Group 2, and 4 serious adverse events were reported by 4 subjects 
(1.7%) in Group 3 (Table 15).  
Of note, 2 febrile convulsions were reported in Group 1, one occurred 2 days after vaccination and was 
associated with serious otitis media and nonserious upper respiratory tract infection and the other 
occurred 33 days after vaccination, and was associated with non-serious upper respiratory tract 
infection. In the Investigator’s opinion, none of these serious adverse events was related to either 
ProQuad or Infanrix hexa. 
No subject has been withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. No subjects died during the 
course of the study.

Summary of injection-site adverse reactions 
Within the diary cards the parents had to fill in all observations due to injection site reactions, which 
were subdivided into parts of solicited and unsolicited injection site reactions. Injection site adverse 
reactions were split by the different arms for the concomitant group. Table 16 summarises the 
injection site adverse reactions. 
Injection site adverse reactions to ProQuad: 
From Day 0 to Day 28 after vaccination, more subjects reported at least one injection-site adverse 
reaction related to ProQuad in Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) compared to Group 2 (ProQuad 
alone) (36.3% and 26.5%, respectively). This difference between Group 1 and Group 2 was mainly 
due to the solicited injection-site adverse reactions to ProQuad from Day 0 to Day 4, which were 
reported by 31.6% of subjects in Group 1 and 19.7% in Group 2. Each of the 3 solicited injection-site 
adverse reaction contributed to this difference: injection-site erythema (16.7% versus 10.7%), 
injection-site pain (20.9% versus 14.1%), and injection-site swelling (9.7% versus 2.6%). 
Overall, a comparable proportion of subjects experienced unsolicited injection-site adverse reactions to 
ProQuad from Day 0 to Day 28 in Group 1 and Group 2 (8.2% and 9.0%, respectively). The intensity 
of injection-site adverse reactions reported from Day 0 to Day 28 were mainly mild and with a low 
percentage severe (e.g. 0.2% for erythema and pain as well as 0.4% for swelling) in Group 1. In 
Group 2 (ProQuad alone) no severe injection site adverse event was reported.

Table 16.  Summary of Injection-Site Adverse Reactions to ProQuad from Day 0 to Day 28 
Injection site adverse reactions to Infanrix hexa: 
As shown in table 17, a comparable proportion of subjects reported injection-site adverse reactions to 
Infanrix hexa in Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) compared to Group 3 (Infanrix hexa alone) 
(65.8% and 65.3%, respectively). Indeed, a comparable proportion of subjects experienced solicited 
injection-site adverse reactions to Infanrix hexa from Day 0 to Day 4 (65.4% in Group 1 and 65.3% in 
Group 3), including injection-site erythema (49.8% and 52.7%, respectively), injection-site pain 
(39.0% and 35.1%) and injection-site swelling (38.0% and 38.9%). 
Overall, a comparable proportion of subjects experienced unsolicited injection-site adverse reactions to 
Infanrix hexa from Day 0 to Day 28 in Group 1 and Group 3 (5.7% and 3.3%, respectively). 
Regarding the intensity of the injection site reaction caused by Infanrix hexa the percentage of severe 
solicited reactions is comparable in the concomitant group versus the single application of Infanrix 
hexa (e.g. erythema [2.7% vs 1.7%], pain [1.5% vs 3.3%] and swelling [1.9% vs 0.8%]. The 
percentage of unsolicited injection-site reactions was slightly increased in the concomitant group 
compared to the Infanrix hexa group. Unsolicited injection-site pain (after Day 4) of severe intensity 
was reported by one subject (0.2%) in Group 1. No unsolicited injection-site reaction of severe 
intensity was reported by subjects in Group 3.

Summary of systemic reactions 
Overall, the percentage of subjects with at least one systemic adverse event reported from Day 0 to 
Day 28 was comparable between groups (70.0% in Group 1, 65.0% in Group 2 and 62.3% in Group 3) 
as given in Table 18.

A comparable percentage of subjects in each group reported systemic adverse events related to 
ProQuad from Day 0 to Day 28 (32.1% in Group 1 and 29.5% in Group 2) as well as to Infanrix hexa 
(21.1% in Group 1 and 16.7% in Group 3). 
• 
• 
The more frequently systemic adverse events reported as related to ProQuad by >=1% of subjects 
were pyrexia (24.1% in Group 1 and 21.4% in Group 2), rash morbilliform (4.6% in Group 1 and 
5.6% in Group 2), rash rubelliform (2.5% in Group 1 and 2.1% in Group 2), rash vesicular (1.5% 
in Group 1 and 0.4% in Group 2) and irritability (1.1% in Group 1 and 1.3% in Group 2). 
The more frequently systemic adverse events reported as related to Infanrix hexa by >=1% of 
subjects were pyrexia (16.0% in Group 1 and 11.3% in Group 3), vomiting (0.2% in Group 1 and 
2.1% in Group 3), irritability (1.3% in both groups) and rash morbilliform (0.4% in Group 1 and 
1.3% in Group 3). 
Regarding the intensity of systemic adverse reactions in Group 1, several related severe adverse 
events were reported by one subject each (fatigue, crying, eczema and rash pruritic related to 
ProQuad and Infanrix hexa, otitis media related to Infanrix hexa, bronchitis and rash morbilliform 
related to ProQuad).  
Assessment report under article 46  
EMA/644797/2014

In Group 2, several severe adverse events related to ProQuad were reported by one subject each 
(irritability, decreased appetite, crying, rash morbilliform and rash vesicular).  
In Group 3, only one subject reported a severe systemic event related to Infanrix hexa (diarrhoea). 
Assessor’s comment: 
All  systemic  reactions  listed  in  the  table  above  are  considered  to  be  related  to  either  ProQuad  or 
Infanrix hexa or to no vaccine. For systemic reactions it seems hard to decide, which systemic reaction 
is caused by which vaccine in group 1.  
Temperature 
Within 28 days after vaccination 69.3%, 61.1%, and 57.3% of subjects reported body temperature 
(rectal or equivalent) >=38°C (100.4°F) in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The corresponding number 
of subjects reporting body temperature >=39.4°C were 22.6%, 20.5% and 15.9%. 
Table 19.  Maximal Temperature from Day 0 to Day 28 
In Groups 1 and 3, there was an increased number of subjects reporting a body temperature ≥38°C on 
Day 0 and Day 1, related to the inactivated vaccine Infanrix hexa and in Groups 1 and 2, there was an 
increased number of subjects reporting a body temperature ≥38°C on Days 5 to 10, related to the live 
vaccine ProQuad., which is shown in the figure 1. 
Regarding intensity of pyrexia ≥40.0°C related to ProQuad were reported by 7 (1.5%) subjects in 
Group 1 and 4 (1.7%) in Group 2. Pyrexia ≥40.0°C related to Infanrix hexa were reported by 3 
subjects (0.6%) in Group 1 and 2 subjects (0.8%) in Group 3.

Assessor’s Comment: 
Overall the percentage of systemic reactions, which were observed, is comparable in all three groups. 
Within the CSR concomitant medications were not listed, which could have an influence on the fever-
rates and/or intensity of temperature. 
Injection-site Rashes 
From Day 0 to Day 28, 14 (3.0%) and 10 (4.3%) subjects reported injection-site rashes of interest in 
Groups 1 and 2, respectively and 2 (0.8%) subjects in Group3 (Table 20) None of injection-site rashes 
was a zoster-like rash. All injection-site rashes were of mild or moderate intensity, most of them (9 in 
Group 1 and 6 in Group 2) started between Day 5 and Day 12, and most lasted between 1 and 7 days. 
One rash in Group 1 lasted more than 14 days and 1 in Group 2 was still ongoing at the end of the 
study. 
There were no reports of mumps disease/mumps-like illness in any group during the study.

Table 20.  Injection site rashes 
Non-Injection site rashes 
From Day 0 to Day 28, no measles diseases were reported. A comparable proportion of subjects 
reported measles-like rashes in Group 1 (ProQuad + Infanrix hexa) (33 subjects (7.0%) experienced 
36 rashes including 2 rashes of severe intensity), and Group 2 (ProQuad alone) (16 subjects (6.8%) 
experienced 16 rashes including 1 rash of severe intensity). Most rashes started between Day 5 and 
Day 12 in both Group 1 (22 rashes) and Group 2 (10 rashes), and in both groups most lasted between 
1 and 7 days. In both groups, 1 rash lasted more than 14 days. 
During the same safety collection period [Day 0-Day 28], 5 subjects (2.1%) from Group 3, who did not 
received a ProQuad vaccination, reported 6 measles-like rashes of which 1 was of severe intensity. 
Most rashes (4) started between Day 0 and Day 4 and all lasted 1-7 days. 
From Day 0 to Day 28, no rubellas were reported. Rubella-like rashes were reported by 18 subjects 
(3.8%) in Group 1 (18 rashes), and 6 subjects (2.6%) in Group 2 (6 rashes), all rashes being of mild 
or moderate intensity. Most rashes started between Day 5 and Day 12 in Group 1, and between Day 0 
and Day 4 in Group 2, and in both groups most lasted 1 to 7 days. The duration was greater than 14 
days for 3 rashes in Group 1 and it was 8 to14 days for 2 rashes in Group 2. 
During the same safety collection period [Day 0-Day 28], 1 subject from Group 3, who did not received 
a ProQuad vaccination, reported 1 rubella-like rash of mild intensity which started between Day 0 and 
Day 4 and lasted 1 to 3 days.

From Day 0 to Day 28, 1 zoster-like rash (0.2%) was reported in Group 1 (zoster-like rash of mild 
intensity, with papular lesions, which started during the first 4 days and lasted 2 days), and 1 (0.4%) 
was reported in Group 2 (zoster-like rash of severe intensity, with vesicular lesions, which started 
between Day 5 and Day 12 and lasted more than 14 days). No non-injection site zoster/zoster-like 
rash was reported in Group 3 (Infanrix hexa alone). 
From Day 0 to Day 28, varicella/varicella-like rashes were reported by 15 subjects (3.2%) in Group 1 
(14 non-injection varicella-like rashes and 2 varicella diseases), 2 subjects (0.9%) in Group 2 (2 non-
injection varicella-like rashes), and 3 subjects (1.3%) in Group 3 (3 non-injection varicella-like 
rashes). In Group 1 most of the rashes started between Day 5 and Day 12, in Group 2, 1 rash started 
between Day 5 and Day 12 and 1 between Day 13 and Day 21, and in Group 3 rashes started between 
Day 0 and Day 4. All rashes were of mild or moderate intensity, and most lasted between 1 and 7 
days. Respectively 3, 1 and 1 rashes lasted more than 14 days in Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. 
Neither mumps nor mumps-like illness was reported in this study.

Of note, non-injection site rashes occurred in Group 3 (without ProQuad injection) with a low 
percentage. Measles-like rashes were reported with a frequency of 2.1% and Varicella-like rashes with 
a frequency of 1.3% although no MMRV-vaccine was administered in Group 3. Most likely these non-
injection site rashes indicate natural infection. 
A higher percentage of non-injection site varicella like rashes was reported in the concomitant group in 
comparison to the non-concomitant group ProQuad. Adding the percentage of non-injection site rashes 
of the non-concomitant groups it was found that the percentage is comparable with the concomitant 
group. 
2.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion And further action if 
required 
This study was designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of concomitant administration of 
ProQuad with Infanrix hexa, when a first dose of ProQuad is administered to subjects from 12 to 23 
months of age concomitantly with a booster dose of Infanrix hexa either as a third dose (2+1 
schedule) or a fourth dose (3+1 schedule). The immunogenicity results demonstrate that following 
concomitant administration of ProQuad with Infanrix hexa no clinically relevant interference in the 
antibody response to each of the individual antigens is observed. Generally higher response rates and 
antibody titres were obtained, when both vaccines were given concomitantly compared to the 
administration of each vaccine alone. The immunisation schedule (3+1 vs 2+1) had limited impact on 
the immunogenicity results and differences observed were previously reported for other concomitant 
use studies of Infanrix hexa with childhood vaccines. 
As to be expected after concomitant administration a higher percentage of adverse reactions were 
observed than after administration of each vaccine alone. More subjects reported at least one solicited 
injection-site adverse reaction related to ProQuad in the concomitant group compared to the non-
concomitant group, whereas a numerically comparable number of subjects reported systemic adverse 
events related to ProQuad in both groups.  
The frequency of adverse reactions in the concomitant group is comparable that of the combined 
frequency of adverse reactions found after administration of both vaccines alone.  Only non-injection 
site varicella-like rashes were reported more frequently in the concomitant group compared to the 
ProQuad alone. The safety profile following concomitant administration is comparable in terms of 
incidence and nature of adverse events to that following separate administration of the vaccines. All 
observed adverse events are already known and described in the SmPCs.  
No list of concomitant medication is available in the CSR, therefore the MAH is asked to provide this 
information. 
In conclusion the immunogenicity and safety data of study X06-MMRV-302 support the concomitant 
administration of ProQuad with Infanrix hexa.  
The MAH is asked to update the SmPC to include information on concomitant administration of 
ProQuad with Infanrix hexa.

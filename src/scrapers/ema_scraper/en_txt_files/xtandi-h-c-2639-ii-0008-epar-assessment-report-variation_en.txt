2.  Scientific discussion 
Worldwide, prostate cancer ranks second in cancer incidence and fifth in cancer mortality in men 
[Globocan, 2012].  Prostate cancer growth is dependent on androgens, and androgen deprivation 
therapy (i.e. treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] analogue or bilateral 
orchiectomy) is the cornerstone of treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer.  Although initial 
response rates are high, the disease can progress despite castrate levels of testosterone at which point 
it is considered castration resistant. Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) represents a lethal 
transition in the natural history of prostate cancer, with most patients dying of disease progression.   
While the precise mechanism through which tumours progress from being castration sensitive to 
castration resistant is unknown,  a key step may include the development of continuous activation of 
androgen signalling.  This activation may arise through androgen receptor gene amplification, 
Xtandi

androgen receptor overexpression, androgen receptor mutations, and/or aberrant androgen receptor 
co-regulation [Scher & Sawyers, 2005].  In addition, studies have shown that tumour cells display 
increased sensitivity to androgen mediated cell growth and intra-tumoral production of androgens.  
These findings suggest that despite androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor signalling 
remains an important mediator of tumour cell growth in CRPC and as such, treatment strategies that 
target the androgen receptor may have important therapeutic potential.   
The treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC often includes anti-androgens such as bicalutamide, 
nilutamide, or flutamide; however, these agents have the potential to stimulate androgen receptor 
signalling and can accelerate tumour cell growth [Bohl et al, 2005].  Immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T 
was shown to be associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared 
with placebo in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC [Kantoff et al, 
2010]; however, this therapy was not associated with improvement in other markers of disease 
progression such as objective radiographic response or prostate specific antigen (PSA) response. In 
2012, abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) plus prednisone was shown to significantly improve 
radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy 
naïve patients with metastatic CRPC compared with prednisone alone. A strong trend toward 
improvement in overall survival was observed in that study, but results did not meet statistical 
significance [Ryan et al, 2013].  Recently, radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium 223) was shown to 
improve overall survival in the chemotherapy naïve subgroup in a study enrolling patients with 
metastatic CRPC and symptomatic bone metastases [Parker et al, 2013].   
Over time, patients with metastatic CRPC generally experience continued disease progression, 
worsening pain, and become eligible for chemotherapy.  Although first line chemotherapy with 
docetaxel plus prednisone demonstrated a survival benefit in these patients [Tannock et al, 2004], its 
use leads to substantial morbidity from severe neutropenia, diarrhoea, and other toxicities.  Other 
treatment options that have demonstrated a survival improvement in patients with metastatic CRPC 
after docetaxel include cabazitaxel plus prednisone [de Bono et al, 2010], abiraterone plus prednisone 
[de Bono et al, 2011], and enzalutamide [Scher et al, 2012].   
Because of its potential side effects many patients are denied chemotherapy.  Recently published data 
from the Swedish Prostate Cancer database indicate that the majority of men younger than 70-years-
old with CRPC were treated with chemotherapy.  In contrast, only half as many men between 70- and 
79-years-old received chemotherapy.  In addition, chemotherapy was often administered shortly prior 
to death [Lissbrant et al, 2013]. 
2.1.  Introduction 
Enzalutamide (Xtandi) is an oral androgen receptor signalling inhibitor designed to block multiple steps 
in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. In non-clinical studies, enzalutamide competitively 
inhibited androgen induced receptor activation in the cytosol, inhibited nuclear translocation of 
activated androgen receptors, and inhibited the association of the activated androgen receptor with 
chromatin, even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells 
resistant to anti-androgens. In addition, enzalutamide treatment decreased the growth of prostate 
cancer cells and induced cancer cell death and tumour regression.   
The clinical benefit of enzalutamide has been shown in patients with metastatic castration resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) who previously received docetaxel based chemotherapy in the phase 3 study, 
CRPC2 (AFFIRM).  Treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg orally once daily resulted in a statistically 
significant and clinically relevant reduction of the risk of death (37% relative risk reduction) compared 
with patients receiving placebo. An improvement in the median overall survival of 4.8 months was 
observed. Time to PSA progression and radiologic progression free survival were also significantly

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 6/92 
 
 
improved in favour of active treatment and time to first skeletal-related event also favoured MDV3100. 
Overall, the benefits of MDV3100 in mCRPC patients who had progressed after 1 or 2 chemotherapy 
regimens at least one containing docetaxel appeared clear, robust and of clinical relevance. The safety 
profile was considered acceptable and generally manageable with basic medical interventions (diuretics 
and antihypertensive medication). Toxicities were generally mild, and resulted in infrequent dose 
reductions, dose interruptions, or discontinuations. 
The European Commission issued a decision to grant marketing authorisation for Xtandi on 21 June 
2013 for the treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose 
disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy. 
The present application is intended to extend the indication of enzalutamide to include the treatment of 
adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who are asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically 
indicated. 
Scientific advice was received from the CHMP on the design of the pivotal study MDV3100-03 
(PREVAIL) to the present application in June 2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/372658/2010). The CHMP was in 
general agreement with the proposed study design (e.g. placebo arm, inclusion/ exclusion criteria) and 
agreed with the use of overall survival and rPFS as co-primary endpoints. The study could be 
considered positive if one of the co-primary endpoints was positive in favour of enzalutamide, as long 
as the treatment effects were favourable on both endpoints. Concern was expressed that an early 
submission based on rPFS data alone could jeopardize the final OS analysis. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted within this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided a justification for the absence of an ERA, which was considered acceptable (see 
below). 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
As part of the initial marketing application, the applicant submitted an environmental risk assessment 
on the active ingredient enzalutamide. The ERA included a Phase I assessment. The calculation of 
predicted environmental concentration in surface water covered all metastatic prostate cancer 
including chemotherapy-naïve metastatic CRPC. The calculated PECsurfacewater value was 0.0084 µg/L. 
The CHMP considered that the new indication is covered by the existing ERA.  
Further data was considered needed at the time of initial marketing authorisation to conclude 
definitively on the potential risk of enzalutamide to the environment. The Applicant was recommended 
to conduct the fish early life cycle test (OECD 210) and the fish sexual development test (OECD 234). 
These studies are ongoing and the final reports are expected to be available by June 2015. Until these 
reports are available, the more restrictive wording agreed at the time of initial marketing authorisation 
is kept in section 6.6 of the SmPC regarding disposal of enzalutamide.

A validated bioanalytical method based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) (PRO3100NC86) was used for concentration determinations of enzalutamide, M1 (carboxylic 
acid derivative), and M2 (N-desmethyl enzalutamide) in human plasma. The employed bioanalytical 
method is the same as the one used in the original marketing application 
Formulation 
The drug product is a liquid-filled capsule of enzalutamide fully dissolved in the fill solution. The 
composition of the enzalutamide solution in the capsules remained unchanged throughout the clinical 
development and differed from the current marketed formulation only in the level of the antioxidant 
butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) in the fill solution (0.1% and 0.01% BHA in the clinical development and 
marketed formulations, respectively). 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study 9785-CL-0321 
Study 9785-CL-0321 was a multinational, phase 2, open-label, single-arm, efficacy, and safety study 
of oral enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks in patients with prostate cancer who 
had non-castrate levels of testosterone at study entry. Patients must not have received prior or 
ongoing hormonal therapy with the intent to treat prostate cancer (surgical castration or other 
hormonal manipulation, e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonists or antagonists, anti-
androgens, or oestrogens).  
Plasma samples for determining Cmin values of enzalutamide, M1, and M2 were obtained pre-dose at 
Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 13, 21, and 25 or at early discontinuation and at the safety follow-up visit. A total 
of 67 patients were enrolled into the study to obtain 60 patients treated through week 24. 
Results 
The mean Cmin plasma concentrations of enzalutamide, M1, M2, and the sum of enzalutamide plus M2 
by visit are presented below.

Cmin concentrations of enzalutamide remained relatively constant beginning at approximately Week 4 
(11.8 μg/mL, CV 20.8%), indicating attainment of steady-state. Cmin concentrations of the sum of 
enzalutamide plus M2 remained relatively constant beginning at approximately Week 9 (23.7 μg/mL, 
CV 20.4%). Similarly, Cmin concentrations of M1 and M2 remained relatively constant beginning at 
approximately Week 9 (8.4 μg/mL, CV 87.1% and 12.1 μg/mL, CV 25.8%, respectively), indicating 
attainment of steady-state. Cmin concentrations of enzalutamide and M2 were similar at Week 9 (11.6 
and 12.1 μg/mL, respectively) and at all-time points thereafter. 
Study MDV3100-03 
Study MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL) was a multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, efficacy and safety study of enzalutamide administered at 160 mg/day orally to patients 
with metastatic CRPC who were chemotherapy-naïve. Patients had to be asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic at study entry, and not have previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients were 
randomly assigned 1:1 to enzalutamide or placebo. Randomization was central and stratified by 
investigative site. 
Pre-dose Cmin samples were collected from all patients at Weeks 5, 13, and 25, and at adverse event-
related, unscheduled visits prior to Week 25. Plasma samples from enzalutamide-treated patients were 
analysed for enzalutamide, M1, and M2. Based on the time to reach steady state (28 days for 
enzalutamide and 56 days for M1 and M2), Week 13 was selected for pharmacokinetic summary 
statistics. For the purpose of exposure-response analyses for safety, Week 13 data were used to define 
steady-state Cmin values; if a Week 13 Cmin value was not available, then alternative qualifying Cmin 
values were considered based on a systematic hierarchy. 
Steady-state Cmin data were examined for relationships with selected demographic characteristics at 
baseline (age, weight) and safety endpoints (common adverse events, adverse events of interest). For 
these analyses, Cmin values for enzalutamide, M2, and the sum of enzalutamide plus M2 were classified 
into 4 categories (quartiles) by rank order for enzalutamide-treated patients and 1 category (Cmin = 0) 
for placebo-treated patients. The statistical methodology was similar to the methodology used for 
Study CRPC2 (AFFIRM) as presented in the initial marketing application. 
Results 
The steady-state Cmin values for enzalutamide, M1, and M2 at Week 13 are provided in Table 2.

Table 4: Baseline age and weight in the enzalutamide, M2, and enzalutamide plus M2 exposure quartiles 
(exposure-response safety population) 
In the exposure-response analyses for safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse events 
of clinical interest), no clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences between exposure 
groups were noted for any individual adverse event. In addition, no adverse event of clinical interest 
had consistent statistically significant findings in pairwise odds ratio comparisons between exposure 
quartiles in enzalutamide, M2, and enzalutamide plus M2.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profiles in study 9785-CL-0321 were generally consistent with those in other 
studies of enzalutamide. The finding that concentrations remained constant after steady state was 
achieved is consistent with the conclusion of time-linearity in the original marketing application. 
The pharmacokinetic data from study MDV3100-03 were also generally consistent with those in other 
studies of enzalutamide and nearly identical to those in the original phase 3 study CRPC2 (AFFIRM), 
Xtandi

where mean steady-state enzalutamide was 11.4 μg/mL, M1 was 8.44 μg/mL, and M2 was 13.0 
μg/mL.  
Results from the pivotal study (MDV3100-03), showed that the mean steady-state Cmin values were 
12.8 ± 3.20 µg/mL for enzalutamide, 6.56 ± 4.97 µg/mL for M1, 13.0 ± 3.58 µg/mL for M2, and 25.7 
± 5.30 µg/mL for enzalutamide plus M2. As expected based on prior data, enzalutamide and M2 
circulate at approximately the same plasma concentrations, and the coefficient of variability is low 
(25.1% for enzalutamide and 27.6% for M2). 
Due to the use of a single dosing regimen in all patients (160 mg/day) and the low pharmacokinetic 
variability, the quartile ranges were narrow. For example, the median values of neighbouring quartiles 
never differed by more than 25%, and the overall difference in the median Cmin concentrations of 
lowest and highest quartiles did not exceed 1.78-fold. Narrow ranges of the exposure quartiles also 
occurred in Study CRPC2 (AFFIRM) and limited the ability to demonstrate clear exposure-response 
relationships. 
The summary statistics provided from study MDV3100-03 (mean and median) suggested a positive 
relationship with increasing exposure in all 3 groups (enzalutamide, M2, and the sum of enzalutamide 
plus M2) with increasing age, and a negative relationship with increasing exposure in the 3 groups with 
decreasing baseline weight. For both age and weight, the ranges (min, max) were overlapping among 
the quartiles. The trends in the means and medians for these covariates were consistent with results in 
the initial marketing application; however, as shown in a population pharmacokinetic model in the 
initial marketing application, the impact of these covariates on enzalutamide pharmacokinetics was 
small and not clinically meaningful when compared to inter-individual and residual variability, and dose 
adjustments were not warranted for either age or weight. 
Based on the exposure-response analyses for safety, no clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant differences between exposure groups were noted for any individual adverse event. In 
addition, no adverse event of clinical interest had consistent statistically significant findings in pairwise 
odds ratio comparisons between exposure quartiles in enzalutamide, M2, and enzalutamide plus M2.  
Taken as a whole, these exposure-response analyses showed no clear or consistent exposure-response 
relationship between enzalutamide, M2, or enzalutamide plus M2 exposure and any single adverse 
event, which is identical to the results for Study CRPC2 (AFFIRM) in the original marketing application. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics data from studies 9785-CL-0321 and MDV3100-03 were consistent with 
those previously described in the initial application.  
No new information on the PK properties of enzalutamide is proposed to be included in the SmPC, 
which is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
This application is based on one single pivotal phase III study, MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL), supported by 
studies CPRC2 (Phase III, AFFIRM), S-3100-1-01 (Phase I), CPRC-MDA-1 (Phase II) and 9785-CL-0111 
(Phase II). In addition, supportive data from a study in hormone naive prostate cancer (9785-CL-
0321) were submitted. The clinical study reports for studies CRPC2, S-3100-1-01, and CRPC-MDA-1 
were provided in the initial marketing application and are summarised below.

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study S-3100-1-01 
This was a Phase I, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation study with dose-expansion at the 
tolerated doses for patients with progressive CRPC, both with and without previous chemotherapy. The 
key objectives of this study were to determine the maximum tolerated dose and initial safety profile of 
enzalutamide, to provide data on the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide, to identify evidence of an 
antitumor effect, and to determine the optimal dose to move forward into Phase III clinical evaluation.

Page 14/92 
 
 
A total of 140 patients with metastatic CRPC (whereof 65 chemotherapy-naïve patients and 75 patients 
who had received prior chemotherapy) were enrolled. Enzalutamide doses of 30, 60, 150, 240, 360, 
480, and 600 mg/day were studied in 7 dose cohorts. 
This antitumor activity was demonstrated consistently across a number of efficacy endpoints: 
- PSA decreases occurred at all doses and in men with and without previous chemotherapy. The extent 
and proportion of patients showing PSA decreases appeared to be dose-dependent from 30 mg to 150 
mg daily, but reached a plateau between 150 mg and 240 mg daily, above which were seen no 
additional effects. 
- The median time to PSA progression was not reached in patients without previous chemotherapy. The 
median time to PSA progression was 316 days (10.4 months) in patients with previous chemotherapy. 
- In patients with measurable disease at study entry, 22/31, or 71%, of those without previous 
chemotherapy had partial responses or stable disease in radiographically evident soft tissue and bone 
lesions. In patients with previous chemotherapy and measurable disease, 23/42, or 55%, had partial 
responses or stable disease. 
- In patients with favourable circulating tumour cell counts at baseline, MDV3100 therapy was 
associated with maintenance of favourable circulating tumour cell counts in almost 80% of patients. In 
patients with unfavourable circulating tumour cell counts at baseline, MDV3100 therapy was associated 
with conversion to favourable circulating tumour cell counts in 69% of patients without previous 
chemotherapy and in 30% of men with previous chemotherapy. 
- MDV3100 therapy was associated with decreases in levels of markers of bone turnover. Of men 
without previous chemotherapy, 87% had decreases in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and 71% 
had decreases in urinary N-telopeptide. Of men with previous chemotherapy, 66% had decreases in 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and 43% had decreases in urinary N-telopeptide. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL) 
This is a multinational phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study

•  Use of herbal products that may have hormonal antiprostate cancer activity and/or are known 
to decrease PSA levels (eg, saw palmetto) or systemic corticosteroids greater than the 
equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day within 4 weeks of enrollment (day 1 visit) 
Patients could withdraw their participation in this study and discontinue treatment with study drug at 
any time for any reason. Investigators or the medical monitor could temporarily or permanently 
remove patients from therapy for the following reasons:  
•  Any adverse event that was intolerable to the patient and that could not be ameliorated by the 
use of adequate medical intervention, or that led to undue risk to the patient if dosing 
continued in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor

Liver function tests (AST, ALT, or total bilirubin) > 5 times the upper limit of normal 
•  Absolute neutrophil count of 750/µL 
• 
Platelet count of < 50,000/µL 
•  Gross noncompliance with the protocol in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor 
Patients who experienced a grade 3 or higher toxicity that could not be ameliorated by the use of 
adequate medical intervention were to interrupt treatment until the toxicity improved to a grade 2 or 
lower severity. 
In addition, patients were required to permanently discontinue treatment with study drug prior to the 
initiation of a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational agent. Patients who permanently 
discontinued study drug treatment for any reason were evaluated at a safety follow-up visit 28 days 
after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational 
agent, whichever was first. After permanent discontinuation of study drug, patients continued to be 
monitored in long-term follow-up for radiographic disease progression (unless disease progression was 
already confirmed), skeletal-related events (unless a skeletal-related event was previously 
documented), additional antineoplastic treatments for prostate cancer and survival. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive enzalutamide 160 mg or placebo, administered as four 
40-mg capsules once per day by mouth. The study drug could be taken with or without food. Patients 
received a 28-day supply (1 bottle) of study drug at each clinic visit through week 21, and an 84-day 
supply (3 bottles) of study drug at week 25 and thereafter. Patients were instructed to store the study 
drug at room temperature out of the reach of children, and return all study drug bottles (used and 
unused) at each clinic visit.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoints 
-  Overall survival was a co-primary efficacy assessment and defined as the time from 
randomization to death due to any cause.  
-  Radiographic progression-free survival was a coprimary efficacy assessment and defined as the 
time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression 
assessed by independent central radiology review or death due to any cause within 168 days 
after treatment discontinuation, whichever was first. 
Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by CT scan or MRI and radionuclide bone scans at 
weeks 9, 17, 25, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Radiographic disease progression in bone (2 or 
more new lesions on radionuclide bone scan) observed at week 9 required 2 additional new lesions on 
a confirmatory scan at least 6 weeks later; radiographic disease progression in bone observed after 
week 9 required persistence of 2 new lesions on a confirmatory scan at least 6 weeks later. 
Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a confirmatory scan for purposes of 
analysis, although study sites were requested to obtain confirmatory soft tissue scans through week 
13. Scheduled and confirmatory scans had a ± 1-week window for completion. 
Radiographic disease progression was evaluated by independent central radiology review using RECIST 
1.1 for soft tissue disease and the PCWG2 guidelines for bone disease as defined in a separate imaging 
review charter until at least the first 410 rPFS events were confirmed. Subsequently, radiographic 
progression was assessed by local radiology review per RECIST 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials 
Working Group 2 (PCWG2). Continued radiographic imaging was not required after radiographic 
progression was confirmed. Independent radiology reviewers (2 for soft tissue and 2 for nuclear 
medicine) read images in a blinded fashion. If there was disagreement between either the 2 
independent reviewers of soft tissue or between the 2 independent reviewers of bone scans in terms of 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 19/92 
 
 
the occurrence or time point of disease progression (confirmed or unconfirmed), a third independent 
reviewer would provide adjudication. 
Secondary endpoints 
- 
Time to First Skeletal-Related Event 
Time to first skeletal-related event was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first 
occurrence of a skeletal-related event for each patient. A skeletal-related event was defined as 
radiation therapy or surgery to bone for prostate cancer, pathological bone fracture, spinal cord 
compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain from prostate cancer. An 
alteration of analgesic medication for bone pain or the initiation of bisphosphonates or denosumab was 
not considered a skeletal-related event. Skeletal-related events were recorded at each scheduled and 
unscheduled study visit and during long-term follow-up if a skeletal-related event was not documented 
previously. 
- 
Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy 
The time from randomization to the date of initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was used for this 
assessment. 
- 
Time to PSA Progression 
The time to PSA progression was defined according to the PCWG2 guidelines. For patients with PSA 
declines at week 13, the PSA progression date was defined as the date that a ≥ 25% increase and an 
absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir was documented, and confirmed by a second 
consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later. For patients with no PSA decline at week 13, the 
PSA progression date was defined as the date that a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 
ng/mL above baseline is documented, and confirmed by a second consecutive value 3 or more weeks 
later. PSA assessments were performed locally at screening, day 1, weeks 13, 17, 21, 25, and every 
12 weeks thereafter, and at the safety follow-up visit. 
- 
PSA Response ≥ 50% 
PSA response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in PSA from baseline to the lowest postbaseline PSA 
value and required confirmation by a consecutive assessment at least 3 weeks later 
-  Best Overall Soft Tissue Response

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Prostate 
The FACT-P quality of life questionnaire is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument 
specifically designed for use in patients with prostate cancer. It consists of 27 core items that assess 
patient function in 4 domains (FACT-G [General] score): physical, social/family, emotional, and 
functional well-being, followed by a domain of 12 items that assess disease-related symptoms. The 
sum of scores in all 5 domains constitutes the FACT-P. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, 
and then combined to produce scores for each domain, as well as a total quality-of-life score with 
higher scores representing better quality of life. A validated version of the questionnaire was provided 
to each patient in the local language and completed by the patient on day 1, at weeks 5, 13, and every 
12 weeks thereafter 
- 
Time to Degradation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate 
The time from randomization to date of degradation of FACT-P was evaluated based on completion of 
the FACT-P on day 1, at weeks 5, 13, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Degradation on the FACT-P was 
defined as at least a 10-point decrease from baseline in the total score. Degradation on individual 
domains of the FACT-P was defined as at least a 3-point decrease from baseline score for that domain. 
- 
European Quality of Life 5-Domain Scale 
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument that measures health outcome. Mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression are each assessed on a 3-point categorical scale 
ranging from “no problem” to “extreme problem.” The EQ-5D questionnaire was administered by study 
site staff directly to the patient on day 1, at week 13, and every 12 weeks thereafter. A validated 
version of the questionnaire was available for use with each patient in the local language 
-  Brief Pain Inventory 
The BPI Short Form (referred to as BPI throughout this report) is a validated self-administered 
instrument designed to measure the level of pain and effect of pain on daily activities. The form 
contains 9 questions and patients were instructed to use the instrument to assess pain related to 
prostate cancer only. A validated version of the questionnaire was provided to each patient in the local 
language 
- 
Time to First Post-baseline Antineoplastic Therapy 
Antineoplastic therapies, including cytotoxic, investigational, and hormonal therapies for prostate 
cancer, were considered for this assessment. Time to first post-baseline antineoplastic therapy was 
defined as time from randomization to date of first use of antineoplastic therapy. Such therapies 
included cytotoxic chemotherapy, noncytotoxic chemotherapy, antiandrogen therapy (ie, bicalutamide, 
nilutamide, flutamide, and enzalutamide), approved immunotherapy, estrogen, abiraterone, and 
investigational agents for prostate cancer. The first new post-baseline antineoplastic therapy could 
have been initiated before the discontinuation of study drug. 
Sample size 
This study was powered to evaluate overall survival and rPFS. The overall type I error rate (2-sided) 
for the study is 0.05 with 0.049 allocated to overall survival and 0.001 allocated to rPFS. The desired 
operating characteristics for the overall survival endpoint were used to determine the total sample size 
for the study and its overall duration. 
The final analysis of overall survival was planned when at least 765 deaths were reported.  A 
prespecified interim analysis of overall survival was planned when approximately 516 deaths (or 67% 
of the total number of deaths for the final overall survival analysis) occurred.  The final prespecified 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 21/92 
 
 
analysis of rPFS was based on a minimum of 410 centrally determined rPFS events and conducted at 
the time of interim analysis of overall survival.   
Randomisation 
After a patient was screened and the investigator determined that the patient was eligible for 
enrolment, the study site staff completed the Randomization Authorization Form and faxed it to 
Medivation. The medical monitor reviewed the form and, if appropriate, approved the enrolment of the 
patient in writing. Once the study site had approval, the patient could proceed with the day 1 visit. If 
all inclusion criteria were met and no exclusion criteria applied, patients were assigned 1:1 to 
enzalutamide or placebo using a centrally administered, randomized, permuted-block method and 
stratified by study site. An IVRS/IWRS assigned the patient a study drug bottle number according to 
the randomization code on day 1. 
Figure 2: Study schematic 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was blinded and placebo-controlled. Placebo capsules were identical in appearance to the 
enzalutamide capsules. All patients, investigators, site personnel, and sponsor personnel involved in 
the conduct of the study were blinded to treatment assignment. Unblinding was to occur only if the 
knowledge of treatment assignment would materially change the planned management of a medical 
emergency. In addition, some patients who had disease progression and previously discontinued study 
drug were unblinded in order to determine eligibility for a subsequent clinical study when this study 
was determined by the investigator to be the best (or only) available treatment option. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analyses for the study are described in the statistical analysis plan finalised on 9 October 
2013 before unblinding of any data. The data cut-off date was 16 September 2013 for all analyses 
summarised in this report unless otherwise specified. The analysis populations are described in Table 
8.

Table 8: Analysis populations 
OS 
The ITT population was used for coprimary efficacy evaluations (overall survival and rPFS). The type I 
error rate of 0.05 was allocated between the 2 coprimary efficacy endpoints: 0.049 (2-sided) for 
overall survival and 0.001 (2-sided) for rPFS. A prespecified interim analysis of overall survival was 
planned when approximately 516 deaths (or 67% of the total number of deaths for the final analysis) 
occurred and was evaluated using a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.012. A 2-stage group sequential 
design with Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function determined by the O'Brien-Fleming approach was 
used to allocate the overall type I error rate, 0.049 (2-sided), between the single interim analysis and 
the final analysis of overall survival. An unstratified log-rank test was used to compare the 
enzalutamide and placebo groups for the interim and final analyses of overall survival. The interim 
analysis of overall survival was prepared by an independent statistical unit, and presented by the 
independent statistician to the independent DMC during the closed session on 21 Oct 2013. 
During the initial development of the design of this study, OS would be looked at using the P = 0.0029 
level, with around 444 deaths by the interim analysis. The final analysis would be for OS at the P = 
0.048 level, scheduled for when 888 deaths had occurred. Nevertheless, based upon the results of the 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 23/92 
 
 
 
COU-AA-302 study with abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-naïve patients and the activity of 
enzalutamide seen in CRPC2 (AFFIRM), the target hazard ratio was reduced from 0.83 to 0.815, which 
reduced the required number of targeted death events from 888 to 765 for a type I error rate of 
0.049. The number of death events required for the interim analysis of OS was increased from 444 to 
516 (67% of events). 
rPFS 
The primary (final) rPFS analysis was conducted at the time of the interim overall survival analysis, 
when a minimum of 410 centrally confirmed rPFS events occurred. Radiographic PFS was compared 
between the 2 treatment groups using a 2-sided unstratified log-rank test. The rPFS analysis was 
prepared by the independent statistical unit and presented to the DMC at the time of the interim 
analysis of overall survival. 
The censoring rules and sensitivity analyses for rPFS are acceptable. 
Secondary endpoints 
The ITT population was used for secondary efficacy evaluations. To maintain a study-wide type I error 
of 5%, the Holm step-down procedure was applied to secondary endpoint analyses.

Roussy (France, site 300, 35 patients, 2.0%), Memorial Sloan-Kettering (US, site 001, 32 patients, 
1.9%), and The Royal Marsden Hospital (United Kingdom, site 650, 29 patients, 1.7%). 
At weeks 25, 49, and 85 (approximately 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively), the number of patients 
in the treatment phase in the enzalutamide group was 777 (89.1%), 643 (73.7%), and 287 (32.9%) 
versus 387 (45.8%), 185 (21.9%), and 48 (5.7%), respectively, for the placebo group. 
As of the data cut-off date, 246 patients (28.2%) in the enzalutamide group and 313 patients (37.0%) 
in the placebo group permanently discontinued from the study. The primary reason for discontinuation 
from the study was death: 540 patients (241 enzalutamide, 27.6% vs 299 placebo, 35.4%). Only 19 
patients (1.1%) withdrew consent for survival follow-up or were lost to survival follow-up prior to 
death. 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol was dated 9 June 2010. The protocol was amended 4 times during the 
blinded study period. A subsequent amendment added an open-label extension period based on the 
recommendation of the DMC to halt the study and allow placebo-treated patients access to 
enzalutamide. 
Major changes to the controlled portion of the study (amendments 1 through 4) are summarized 
below. 
Amendment 1 (27 Aug 2010, prior to first randomization) made the following major changes: 
-  Replaced the original primary efficacy variables (time to first skeletal-related event and time to 
initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy) with new primary efficacy variables (overall survival and 
progression-free survival [PFS]). 
-  Added that the primary analysis of overall survival was to be performed when 888 deaths were 
reported. 
-  Specified that the study would not be discontinued based on the primary analysis of PFS; the 
study was to continue until the primary analysis of overall survival was complete. 
Amendment 2 (29 Mar 2011, after 153 patients were randomized) made the following major changes: 
-  Clarified that informed consent must be signed, and abdominopelvic CT scan or MRI, bone 
scan, chest x-ray or chest CT must occur within 6 weeks of randomization, otherwise the 
screening visit had to be repeated. 
-  Clarified that chest CT should be performed at the time of radiographic assessments if 
screening scan demonstrated metastatic chest disease. 
-  Added that determination of radiographic progression had to be confirmed by the independent 
central radiology review before stopping radiographic imaging. 
-  Clarified that the BPI was to assess prostate cancer-related pain only. 
Amendment 3 (23 Jul 2012, after 1696 patients were randomized) made the following major changes: 
-  Specified that the primary analysis of rPFS was to be based on the first 410 rPFS events and 
conducted at the time of the formal interim analysis of overall survival. 
-  Clarified that the prespecified interim analysis for overall survival was to be performed at 
approximately 50% of the required total number of death events (444 of 888) for the primary 
overall survival analysis and not at the end of the enrollment period.

Amendment 4 (14 Mar 2013, after all 1717 patients were randomized) made the following major 
changes: 
-  Added secondary objectives (time to PSA progression, PSA response 50%, best overall soft 
tissue response, and safety of enzalutamide compared to placebo). Time to PSA progression 
and safety were formerly other secondary objectives. 
-  Clarified that rPFS was to be analyzed from randomization to radiographic progression or death 
within 168 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever was first). 
-  Clarified that a minimum of the first 410 rPFS events were required for the primary PFS 
analysis. After the required 410 rPFS events, radiographic progression should be confirmed by 
the local radiology review before stopping radiographic imaging. 
-  Changed the assumed target hazard ratio for benefit of enzalutamide over placebo in overall 
survival from 0.83 to 0.815. The minimum target number of deaths required for the primary 
analysis of overall survival changed from 888 to 765 due to increased assumed effect size. 
-  Updated statistical endpoints and methods to be consistent with new objectives and the 
statistical analysis plan.

Numbers analysed 
The pre-specified interim analysis of overall survival and final analysis of rPFS occurred on 21 October 
2013. Based on these analyses, the DMC recommended halting the blinded portion of the study and 
allowing patients randomized to placebo access to open-label enzalutamide. The data cut-off date for 
all analyses was 16 September 2013, except the data cut-off date of 06 May 2012 which was used for 
the analyses of rPFS. 
Table 15: Efficacy Analysis Populations 
The endpoint of rPFS excluded the 84 patients who were not randomised before the rPFS data cut-off 
date of 06 May 2012. Hence the ITT population for rPFS constitutes 1633 subjects.

The MAH also conducted an updated OS analysis which used a data cut-off date of 15 January 2014.  
This information was not submitted in the initial application. Study sites were instructed to update 
survival status and a formal survival sweep was not conducted.  Information was available for the 
majority of patients remaining in the study.   
These updated survival data include the following:  
• 
Approximately 4 additional months of survival follow-up data;

Using the data cut-off date of 15 January 2014, a total of 656 deaths were available for analysis, 
including 299/872 deaths (34.3%) in the enzalutamide group and 357/845 (42.2%) in the placebo 
group. Patients who were alive at the time of the data cut-off date were censored at the last date 
known to be alive. For patients with any data (e.g., adverse events, laboratory values, concomitant 
medications, vital signs, etc.) in the clinical database after the 15 Jan 2014 data cut-off date, the last 
date known alive was set to 15 January 2014.

included in the analysis. Overall compliance with submission of radiographic scans to the central reader 
was > 98% (percentage of all scans performed that were received for central review) and the median 
time to each scheduled tumour assessment time point was nearly identical between treatment groups.

Table 20: MDV3100-03 Concordance between Independent Central Review and Investigator 
Assessment (ITT Population) 
The primary rPFS results were shown to be robust through pre-specified sensitivity analyses evaluating 
the effect of various censoring rules, such as inclusion of all deaths rather than deaths within 168 days 
of treatment discontinuation, requirement for soft tissue confirmation before week 13, and other 
analyses censoring for clinical progression events (hazard ratios ranging from 0.174-0.234, all p < 
0.0001). In addition, an analysis of rPFS using investigator assessments through the overall survival 
data cut-off date (16 Sep 2013) and including all randomized patients showed consistent findings in 
favour of enzalutamide treatment (HR = 0.307, 95% CI: 0.267, 0.353, p < 0.0001). In this more 
mature analysis, the median duration of rPFS was 19.7 months for patients receiving enzalutamide 
(95% CI: 18.1, 22.3) compared with 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.2, 5.6) for patients receiving placebo.

The FACT-P was only collected during the treatment period. As a result, the median follow-up times 
based on reverse Kaplan-Meier estimation corresponded to treatment exposure time and were 16.6 
months in the enzalutamide group and 5.6 months in the placebo group.

Table 28: Time to Degradation of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (ITT Population) 
Statistically significant results (p ≤ 0.0001) were also demonstrated in time to degradation of each of 
the 5 individual domains, defined as a decrease in at least 3 points from baseline in the domain. These 
domains assess physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-
being, and prostate cancer symptoms (hazard ratio range, 0.664-0.745). 
•  Quality of Life: Summary of the European Quality of Life 5-Domain Scale 
As specified in the statistical analysis plan, no statistical tests were performed on the differences in 
quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D between treatment groups or over time. Summary data 
throughout the study are difficult to interpret given the decreasing number of patients completing the 
questionnaire over time, especially in the placebo group.  
After week 25, the differences in the number of patients completing the assessment between groups is 
too large to provide meaningful comparisons. Overall through week 25, patients treated with 
enzalutamide had numerically higher quality of life scores across all domains as measured by the EQ-
5D compared with patients treated with placebo 
•  Quality of Life: Pain Progression as Assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory 
At baseline, the mean/median pain intensity score was 0.8/0.3 in the enzalutamide group and 0.7/0.0 
in the placebo group. At month 6, the mean/median pain intensity score was 1.0/0.0 in the 
enzalutamide group and 1.2/0.5 in the placebo group. At month 6, 31.8% of the enzalutamide group 
had progression of pain compared with 37.2% of the placebo group. The difference in the rate of pain 
progression between treatment groups (enzalutamide minus placebo; 5.35%) was not statistically 
significant based on an unstratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel score test (p = 0.082). At month 6, the 
mean change from baseline for each component of the pain intensity score was numerically less in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group. However, less than half of the placebo group 
remained on study and completed a baseline and week 25 BPI assessment (42.4% compared with 
80.0% of the enzalutamide group) and overall pain intensity scores were generally very low at each 
assessment (median scores of 0, mean < 2 for each question).

Similarly, pain interference scores evaluating the effect of pain across 7 different daily activities were 
low in both groups at baseline (median score of 0 at for each domain; mean score of < 1 for each 
domain); however, the change from baseline in mean pain interference scores at month 6 was 
numerically less in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group for each of the 7 
domains. Mean pain interference scores, defined as the average of each of the 7 domains, were 
calculated at baseline and month 6. Patients treated with enzalutamide had a lower percentage change 
from baseline to month 6 in mean pain interference scores. No statistical comparisons were made 
between treatment groups in evaluating pain interference. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sub-group analyses 
Subgroup analyses of overall survival and rPFS were performed to determine if the treatment effect 
was consistent among subgroups. The same methodology used for overall survival and rPFS 
respectively, was applied to each subgroup which was defined by the following variables: 
●   Baseline ECOG performance status (0 or 1) 
●   Age category (< 75 and ≥ 75 years) 
●   Geographic region (North America, Europe, and rest of world) 
●   Total Gleason score (≤ 7 and ≥ 8) at diagnosis 
●   Type of progression (PSA progression only vs. radiographic progression with or without PSA 
progression) at study entry 
●   Visceral disease (lung and/or liver) based on both target and nontarget lesions at screening (y/n) 
●   Baseline PSA value (≤ median vs. > median) 
●   Baseline LDH value (≤ median vs. > median) 
●   Baseline haemoglobin value (≤ median vs. > median) 
“Baseline bisphosphonate or denosumab use (yes or no)” was added to the subgroup analysis for rPFS.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The primary data characterising the efficacy of enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve men with 
metastatic prostate cancer that progressed on androgen deprivation therapy arises from the pivotal 
study in this population (MDV3100-03 in 1717 patients [872 enzalutamide, 845 placebo]).  The 
efficacy of enzalutamide in this population was also assessed in a subset of patients in study 
S-3100-1-01 (65 chemotherapy-naïve patients of 140 patients enrolled with metastatic CRPC) and 
CRPC-MDA-1 (12 chemotherapy-naïve patients of 60 patients enrolled with metastatic CRPC).   
The efficacy of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received docetaxel was 
primarily assessed in CRPC2 (1199 patients [800 enzalutamide, 399 placebo]), S-3100-1-01 
(75 patients of 140 enrolled), CRPC-MDA-1 (44 patients of 60 enrolled), and 9785-CL-0111 (all 
38 patients enrolled in the efficacy cohort).

The most well-established endpoints for evaluating the efficacy of enzalutamide in patients with 
metastatic CRPC are overall survival and rPFS as assessed in the controlled clinical studies, 
MDV3100-03 and CRPC2. Long-term follow-up for overall survival was not performed in any of the 
open-label studies, and radiographic data from these studies focused primarily on radiographic 
response rate.  An additional clinically relevant endpoint only obtained within the controlled studies 
included time to first skeletal-related event.  Evaluation of quality of life measures varied between the 
2 controlled studies given the different study populations, although both utilised the FACT-P, EQ-5D, 
and BPI.  Best overall soft tissue response was evaluated in MDV3100-03, CRPC2, S-3100-1-01, and 
9785-CL-0111.  Markers of bone turnover were included in S-3100-1-01 and 9785-CL-0111.  
Circulating tumour cell counts were included in CRPC2, S-3100-1-01, and 9785-CL-0111, but data 
were only available from S-3100-1-01 and 9785-CL-0111. PSA response rates were obtained across all 
studies.   
Although initial evidence of efficacy assessed by PSA response rate has been demonstrated in patients 
with hormone-naïve prostate cancer in study [9785-CL-0321], this comparative section will focus on a 
discussion of the data from studies of patients with metastatic prostate cancer that progressed on 
androgen deprivation therapy. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of patients with metastatic CRPC enrolled across the studies 
were generally well matched.  The major differences between the studies were related to the target 
study population and to prior treatments for prostate cancer: MDV3100-03, the pivotal study for this 
application, enrolled only chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic CRPC; CRPC2 enrolled only 
patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received docetaxel.  The other presented studies 
enrolled patients with metastatic CRPC without regard to prior chemotherapy.  Other differences 
among the study populations were primarily related to eligibility for each study (eg, inclusion of only 
Japanese patients in 9785-CL-0111, exclusion of patients with ECOG performance status > 1 in 
MDV3100-03). 
OS 
Overall survival was assessed as a primary endpoint in both controlled studies, and was defined as the 
time from randomization to death due to any cause.   
Enzalutamide treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death compared 
with placebo treatment in both studies.  In MDV3100-03, the unstratified hazard ratio was 0.706 (95% 
CI: 0.596, 0.837; p < 0.0001).  In CRPC2, the stratified hazard ratio was 0.631 (95% CI: 0.529, 
0.752; p < 0.0001).   
In both studies, the survival benefit was observed early, with separation of the Kaplan Meier curves 3 
to 4 months after randomization.  The longer estimated median durations of survival in MDV3100-03 
compared with CRPC2 reflect the earlier stage disease of the MDV3100-03 patient population.  In 
MDV3100-03, the estimated medians are considered unstable because of the small number of patients 
at risk at the times the medians were estimated and shorter duration of follow up for overall survival 
relative to the estimated medians, both of which contribute to the large variability associated with the 
medians. 
rPFS 
Radiographic progression free survival was a coprimary endpoint in MDV3100-03 and a key secondary 
endpoint in CRPC2.  In MDV3100-03, rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to first 
objective evidence of radiographic progression or death within 168 days of treatment discontinuation, 
whereas in CRPC2, rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest objective evidence 
of disease progression or death due to any cause.  Both studies utilized PCWG2 and RECIST 1.1 criteria 
for determining progression, although in MDV3100-03, radiographic progression was evaluated by 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 49/92 
 
 
independent blinded central reviewers and by investigators, whereas in CRPC2 radiographic 
progression was evaluated only by investigators.  The 2 studies also utilized different censoring rules, 
although both studies demonstrated that results were robust to sensitivity analyses evaluating the 
impact of different censoring conventions 
A final important difference in rPFS evaluations between the 2 studies was in the radiographic 
assessment schedule.  In MDV3100-03, on study imaging occurred at weeks 9, 17, 25, and every 12 
weeks thereafter whereas in CRPC2, on study imaging occurred at week 13 and every 12 weeks 
thereafter.  This difference allowed for an earlier separation of Kaplan Meier curves in MDV3100-03 
compared with CRPC2.  In both studies, enzalutamide treated patients had a statistically significant 
decreased risk of radiographic progression or death.  In MDV3100-03, the unstratified hazard ratio was 
0.186 (95% CI: 0.149, 0.231; p < 0.0001).  In CRPC2, the stratified hazard ratio was 0.404 (95% CI: 
0.350, 0.466; p < 0.0001). 
Supportive studies 
Study 9785-CL-0111 
Study 9785-CL-0111 was a phase 1/2, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation study in 
47 Japanese patients with metastatic CRPC, including 43 previously treated with docetaxel and 4 
chemotherapy-naïve patients. Nine patients were in the dose-escalation cohort and 38 patients were in 
the dose-expansion cohort used for efficacy analyses. After receiving single doses of enzalutamide 80, 
160, or 240 mg, patients received 80 or 160 mg once daily during a multiple-dose period and 
subsequently commenced long-term dosing with enzalutamide 160 mg/day. Efficacy endpoints 
included radiographic objective response at day 85, PSA response, circulating tumor cells, and markers 
of bone turnover. Radiographic response was evaluated by an independent RECIST evaluation 
committee and by the investigator. 
Of the 38 patients in the dose-expansion cohort included in efficacy analyses, the median age was 71.5 
years (range, 50-85 years) and all were of Japanese descent. Twenty-five patients (65.8%) entered 
the study with an ECOG performance status of 0 and 13 (34.2%) had an ECOG performance status of 
1. Twenty-nine patients (76.3%) had Gleason scores at diagnosis of 8 to 10 and median PSA at 
baseline was 65.8 ng/dL. A major difference in this small study population compared with the CRPC2 
study population was that most patients received prior treatment with estramustine in addition to prior 
treatment with docetaxel and had a greater number of prior hormonal treatments. 
The radiographic objective response rate (CR or PR) at day 85 was 5.3% as assessed by the 
independent RECIST evaluation committee and 7.9% as assessed by the investigator. When evaluating 
best overall radiographic response rates during long-term dosing, the values were 11.1% by the 
RECIST committee and 5.9% by the investigator. Radiographic disease control rate (CR, PR, or stable 
disease) at day 85 was 47.4% as assessed by the RECIST committee and 50% as assessed by the 
investigator. Best overall radiographic disease control rate during long-term dosing was 66.7% as 
assessed by the RECIST committee and 64.7% by the investigator. Eleven of 38 patients (28.9%) had 
a ≥ 50% decrease in PSA at the time of nadir; 4 of 38 patients (10.5%) had a ≥ 90% decrease in PSA 
at the time of nadir. 
Of the 38 evaluable patients, 20 patients had favourable circulating tumour cell counts at baseline (< 5 
per 7.5-mL blood), and a total of 26 patients had evaluable baseline and post-baseline circulating 
tumour cell data. 
Of the 20 patients with favourable circulating tumour counts at baseline, enzalutamide treatment was 
associated with maintenance of favourable circulating tumour counts in 53.8% of patients. Of the 18 
patients with unfavourable circulating tumour counts at baseline, 9 patients had post-baseline samples.

Assessment report

Page 50/92 
 
 
Of those, enzalutamide treatment was associated with conversion to favourable circulating tumour 
counts in 5 patients (56%) who had previously received chemotherapy. 
Serum markers of bone turnover (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptide) were 
variable and mean concentrations did not change substantially over the course of the study. 
This study showed the antitumor effects of enzalutamide (160 mg/day) by radiographic response, PSA 
response, and circulating tumor cells in Japanese patients with metastatic CRPC, the majority of whom 
previously received docetaxel.  The magnitudes of the benefits observed in this study were not as large 
as those observed in CRPC2; however, this study population was small and uncontrolled and included 
patients treated with a higher number of previous therapies. 
Study 9785-CL-0321 
Study 9785-CL-0321 was a phase 2, multicentre, open-label, single-arm efficacy and safety study of 
enzalutamide 160 mg/day for 24 weeks in patients with prostate cancer who had non-castrate levels of 
testosterone at study entry.  The primary objective was to evaluate PSA response rate ≥ 80% at 
week 25.  Secondary and exploratory efficacy objectives included an evaluation of the effect of 
enzalutamide on circulating hormones (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and N-telopeptide), quality 
of life using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25, and objective tumor response (in the subset of 
patients with metastatic disease).  Patients who had clinical benefit at week 25 could continue to 
receive enzalutamide until objective or clinical disease progression, or occurrence of an unacceptable 
toxicity at the discretion of the investigator.  Sixty-seven men were enrolled; all patients received at 
least 1 dose of enzalutamide.  Of these, 66 of patients were white (98.5%) and 1 was black or African 
American (1.5%).  The median age was 73 years (range, 48-86 years) and the mean duration of 
prostate cancer was 2.8 years.  Tumour was confined to the prostate in 31 patients (46.3%) and 
Gleason score was 8 to 10 at initial diagnosis in 16 patients (23.9%).   
Overall, 62 patients (92.5%) had a PSA response ≥ 80% at week 25.  Of the 5 patients categorized as 
non-responders, 4 patients did not complete 25 weeks of treatment; and 1 patient with a 57.0% PSA 
decline at week 25 had a 90.7% PSA decline at week 9.  Of the 63 patients who completed 25 weeks 
of treatment, 62 patients (98.4%) had a ≥ 80% decline in PSA.  The mean maximum PSA decline was 
98.3% through week 25.  At week 49 (1 year of treatment), 54 of 67 patients (80.6%) had a PSA 
response ≥ 80%; the 13 patients considered non-responders were those who did not complete 
49 weeks of treatment.  All 54 patients (100%) who were on treatment for 1 year had a ≥ 80% 
decline in PSA from baseline.  The mean maximum PSA decline was 99.0% through week 49.  At 
week 25 and week 49, increases were observed in mean bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (14.8% 
and 12.4%) and N-telopeptide (66.6% and 62.3%).  Based on responses to the QLQ-C30, global 
health status was maintained at week 25 and week 49.  At week 25 and week 49, sexual activity and 
sexual function were decreased, based on limited responses to the QLQ-PR25.  Of 26 evaluable 
patients at week 25, 11.5% had a CR and 19.2% had a PR; and at week 49, 19.2% had a CR and 
11.5% had a PR. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The placebo-controlled design of study MDV3100-03 (PREVAIL) is considered acceptable given that 
there were no other approved treatments in the EU for the intended population at the time of study 
initiation. 
The patients enrolled in this trial were deemed as not yet candidates to receive docetaxel therapy 
when the study was carried out. Only asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with disease 
Xtandi 
Assessment report

Page 51/92 
 
 
progression (PSA-Soft tissue-Bone) were recruited. During the study, all patients continued on a LHRH 
analogue or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. It has therefore been reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
that medical castration with an LHRH analogue should be continued during treatment of patients not 
surgically castrated. Patients were allowed to receive Sipuleucel-T during the study. Importantly, 
concomitant treatment with abiraterone was allowed once patients had either confirmed radiographic 
progression or a skeletal-related event. Bisphosphonates, palliative therapy including radiation therapy 
and opiate analgesics were also allowed.  
The primary objectives of study MDV3100-03 were to determine the benefit of enzalutamide compared 
with placebo on overall survival and rPFS.  Secondary and exploratory objectives were to determine 
the benefit of enzalutamide compared with placebo on clinically relevant markers of disease 
progression and quality of life.  The objectives of the study are considered acceptable as well as the 
endpoints proposed in this setting. The frequency and methods for scheduled assessments of the 
progression disease (intervals; 4 weeks through week 49 and then every 12 weeks thereafter) is 
considered acceptable and the use of central radiology review is of value, despite the double blind 
design. The censoring rules proposed are overall acceptable.  
The concurrent interim analysis of overall survival and final analysis of rPFS were consistent with prior 
regulatory advice. 
Between September 2010 and September 2012, 1717 patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with 
enzalutamide or placebo across 207 study centres in 22 countries. As of January 2014, placebo treated 
patients began crossing-over to enzalutamide treatment on an amended MDV3100-03 protocol which 
could have biased future updates of the data.  
The treatment groups were overall well balanced with respect to clinically relevant baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics. Of note, the percentage of patients with visceral disease was 
11.2% and 12.5% in enzalutamide and placebo arms respectively. 2.5% and 3.0% of patients in each 
arm did not have disease progression per protocol at study entry. 
In relation to prior therapy of prostate cancer, about 28 % and 18 % of patients had received 3 and ≥ 
4 unique prior hormonal therapy. The number of unique prior hormonal therapies does not represent 
the number of “lines” and were defined as distinct hormonal drug treatments for prostate cancer that 
were started prior to randomization. 
More than 50% (53.1%) of patients recruited into the trial were in Europe (including Israel). The most 
common reason for discontinuation for both groups was “Discontinuation due to disease progression” 
(enzalutamide group: 40.7% vs Placebo group: 68.3%). Of them, both radiographic progression and 
clinical progression were higher for the placebo group (enzalutamide arm: 32.7% and 9.7% vs Placebo 
group: 54.6% and 17.8% respectively). Discontinuations due to skeletal-related events were quite 
similar between arms (5.0% vs 5.4%). 5.6% subjects in the enzalutamide group and 6.0% subjects in 
the placebo group discontinued treatment due to AEs, which could give an overall impression of the 
tolerability of the drug. 
The protocol of the study was modified several times, especially the fourth amendment was critical. 
This one was carried out after knowing the results from the study conducted with abiraterone. This was 
somehow expectable and the changes introduced will likely not modify the conclusions of the study. 
The second amendment was introduced after 153 patients were randomised. Due to the low number of 
subjects, a high impact on the results is unlikely.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Enzalutamide has shown positive results in all the variables studied. Both co-primary endpoints were 
met. Data on OS with data cut-off date September 2013 clearly indicated a higher life expectancy for 
patients treated with enzalutamide (HR 0.706, 95% CI: 0.596, 0.837) even though the estimate in 
terms of medians was not accurate and could not provide a clear reflection of the benefit for the 
patients due to the immature nature of the data.  
The updated analysis (cut-off January 2014; after four additional months and 116 additional deaths; 
58 in each group) confirmed the observations from the pre-specified interim analysis (HR 0.730 and 
HR 0.706 respectively).  The updated median overall survival was not yet reached in the enzalutamide 
group and was 31 months in the placebo group. The data are still considered immature (38 %) 
although an HR of 0.7 suggests a large treatment benefit. As a consequence, the MAH should submit 
an OS update together with an update on investigator assessed rPFS no later than September 2015 
(see Annex II condition).  
This outcome in terms of OS was supported by the vast majority of the subgroups analysed.  
Results from the other co-primary endpoint were also positive (rPFS). A total of 118 patients (14.2%) 
in the enzalutamide group and 321 patients (40.1%) in the placebo group experienced radiographic 
progression or death within 168 days after study drug discontinuation at the time of the data cut-off 
date of 6 May 2012 (HR 0.186; 95% CI: 0.149, 0.231). Estimated median duration of rPFS was not yet 
reached in the enzalutamide group (95% CI: 13.8, not yet reached) and 3.9 months in the placebo 
group (95% CI: 3.7, 5.4) (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). As expected for this patient population, the 
rPFS endpoint comprised mainly radiographic progression events (89% enzalutamide group vs 92% 
placebo group) rather than death events prior to radiographic progression. In general, soft tissue 
progression was observed before bone progression which may be due to the fact that soft tissue 
progression required no confirmatory scan as per the protocol but also that metastatic spread involving 
soft tissue is associated with a more aggressive nature of the disease. Consistent rPFS benefit was 
observed across all pre-specified patient subgroups (e.g., age, baseline ECOG performance, baseline 
PSA and LDH, Gleason score at diagnosis, and visceral disease at screening). 
Median follow-up time based on reverse Kaplan-Meier estimation was 5.4 months for the enzalutamide 
group versus 3.6 months for the placebo group. The separation of the curves was clearly shown. Both 
the subgroup analyses and the sensitivity analyses carried out pointed out in the same direction.  
Regarding the use of subsequent therapies there was a higher and earlier use in the placebo group 
(70.3%) compared with the enzalutamide group (40.3%). While according to the patient disposition a 
total of 932 patients were considered to have disease progression, a total of 1024 subjects received 
any post-baseline antineoplastic therapy. This apparent discrepancy is a result of patients in both 
treatment groups discontinuing treatment for reasons other than disease progression, such as 
withdrawal of consent, an adverse event or rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA), but then requiring 
subsequent antineoplastic therapies at some point between discontinuation and the data cut-off date.  
Only a small proportion (0.8%) of patients randomized to enzalutamide received concomitant 
treatment with abiraterone, almost 20% received subsequent treatment with abiraterone, and the 
majority of patients (79.5%) received neither subsequent nor concomitant treatment with abiraterone. 
The hazard ratio was less favourable for enzalutamide-treated patients who received subsequent 
treatment with abiraterone (HR 1.23 [95% CI: (0.89, 1.68)]) and for enzalutamide-treated patients 
who received subsequent treatment with docetaxel (HR 1.47 [95% CI: (1.17, 1.85)]). Notwithstanding 
the inherent bias associated to these analyses, a possible cross-resistance among treatments cannot 
Xtandi

Page 53/92 
 
 
 
be totally ruled out. Results of ongoing studies may provide further evidence on the sequential use of 
abiraterone-enzalutamide. “Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated with abiraterone” has been included as missing information in the RMP and a study will collect 
data on the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in these patients. 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, time to first skeletal-
related event, best overall soft tissue response, time to PSA progression, and PSA response ≥ 50% 
were in favour of enzalutamide. The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 28.0 
months for patients receiving enzalutamide and 10.8 months for patients receiving placebo 
(HR=0.350, 95% CI: [0.303, 0.403], p<0.0001) (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Exploratory analyses were in line with the results observed from primary and secondary endpoints. 
Even though data of QoL should be cautiously interpreted, overall, they seemed to favour 
enzalutamide. 
The apparent imbalance between the two arms with regard to deaths as primary reason for study drug 
discontinuation with more events in the enzalutamide arm (17 patients) compared to placebo (7 
patients) may be due to the longer time on study for enzalutamide treated patients compared with 
placebo-treated patients, as the median time on enzalutamide treatment was 3.6-fold longer than the 
median time on placebo treatment. 
Comparison between the two phase III pivotal studies (MDV3100-03 and CRPC2) is marked by the 
different prognosis of patients recruited in each study, making difficult to draw conclusions in terms of 
consistency. However, regardless of the setting studied in the different studies, it can be concluded 
that the efficacy of enzalutamide has been shown in the docetaxel naïve subjects as it was shown in 
patients previously treated with docetaxel. 
In relation to the supportive studies provided, they can only be deemed exploratory in nature as they 
refer to a different population. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of enzalutamide has been reasonably shown in the treatment of metastatic castration 
resistant prostate cancer in adult men who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of 
androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- In order to address the uncertainties regarding long-term efficacy, the MAH should submit updated 
results from the PREVAIL study and more specifically updated OS and investigator assessed rPFS data. 
The MAH should present the data based on the latest time point where investigator assessed rPFS data 
according to the study protocol is available and where data is not significantly affected by cross-over. 
The due date for the submission of these data is 30/09/2015. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The safety profile of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC is derived primarily from 9 clinical 
studies including 3702 patients.  These studies include two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
studies (MDV3100-03 and CRPC2), 4 open-label safety and tolerability studies (S-3100-1-01, 
CRPC-MDA-1, 9785-CL-0111, 9785-CL-0121), an open-label relative bioavailability study 
(9785-CL-0003), an open-label drug-drug interaction study (9785-CL-0007), and an expanded access 
protocol (9785-CL-0401). Together these studies include 2509 patients treated with enzalutamide plus

Page 54/92 
 
 
standard of care and 1243 patients treated with placebo plus standard of care (50 patients later 
crossed over to open-label enzalutamide treatment in CRPC2).  Of the 2509 enzalutamide-treated 
patients in the integrated safety population, 967 patients (38.5%) did not receive prior docetaxel and 
are considered chemotherapy-naïve, and 1542 patients (61.5%) previously received docetaxel (or 
another cytotoxic chemotherapy).  All patients received ongoing androgen deprivation therapy or had 
prior bilateral orchiectomy to maintain castrate levels of testosterone.   
The MAH provided safety data in three main populations of patients with metastatic CRPC: 
  The controlled study in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic CRPC:  MDV3100-03 
(N = 871 enzalutamide, N = 844 placebo). 
  The combined controlled studies in metastatic CRPC:  patients with chemotherapy-naïve 
metastatic CRPC (MDV3100-03) and patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with 
docetaxel (CRPC2) (N = 1671 enzalutamide, N = 1243 placebo). 
  The integrated safety population of all enzalutamide-treated patients (N = 2509).  This 
population includes enzalutamide-treated patients in the combined controlled population and 
enzalutamide-treated patients in the combined open-label population (N = 1001). 
Patient exposure 
A total of 871 patients in the enzalutamide group and 844 patients in the placebo group received at 
least 1 dose or partial dose of study drug in MDV3100-03.  The median treatment duration for the 
enzalutamide group was 16.6 months compared with 4.6 months for the placebo group.  
Approximately 68% of patients treated with enzalutamide remained on study drug for at least 1 year 
compared with 18% of patients treated with placebo; approximately 16% of patients treated with 
enzalutamide remained on study drug for at least 2 years compared with approximately 3% of patients 
treated with placebo.  Of note, some patients currently on study drug have not reached 2 years on 
study drug as enrolment ended approximately 1 year before the data cut-off date.  The dose of 
enzalutamide was 160 mg once daily, although dose interruptions and reductions were permitted as 
needed.   
The extent of exposure to enzalutamide and placebo in MDV3100-03 is summarized in the below table.

Adverse events 
As expected for patients with advanced prostate cancer, most patients in the integrated safety 
population experienced at least 1 adverse event.  Consistent with the inclusion of patients with more 
advanced disease in the combined controlled population and integrated safety population, the 
incidence of grade 3 and higher adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events as the primary 
reason for treatment discontinuation, adverse events leading to dose interruption, and adverse events 
leading to dose reduction were generally higher in the enzalutamide group of the combined controlled 
population and/or the integrated safety population compared with the enzalutamide group of 
MDV3100-03.  A similar pattern was observed in the placebo group of the combined controlled 
population compared with the placebo group of MDV3100-03.

Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events in MDV3100-03 
The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events (of any causality) in MDV3100-03 was higher in the 
enzalutamide group (42.9%) than in the placebo group (37.1%); however, the difference was 
primarily due to the longer exposure time in the enzalutamide group.  The incidence of grade 3 or 
higher adverse events was lower in the enzalutamide group within the first 90, 180, and 365 days of 
treatment.  The imbalance toward higher incidence in the enzalutamide group was observed after 
1 year of treatment when 67.8% of patients in the enzalutamide group remained on study drug 
(compared with 18.0% of patients in the placebo group).  Similarly, the time to first grade 3 or higher 
adverse event was longer in the enzalutamide group (22.3 months) than the placebo group 
(13.3 months), a delay of 9 months.

Table 37: Time-adjusted grade 3 or higher adverse events in MDV3100-03 
The higher incidence of grade 3 events of cataract was evaluated further along with additional events 
of grade 3 cataract operation.  When these terms were combined, the incidence of grade 3 
cataract/cataract operation was 1.3% vs 0.2%.  Of the 11 enzalutamide-treated patients with grade 3 
cataract/cataract operation, the events were reported as early as study day 20 and as late as study 
day 600.  Three patients (0.3%) had cataract events within the first 90 days of treatment, 1 patient 
had a cataract event between 90 and 180 days of treatment, 3 patients had cataract events between 
180 and 365 days of treatment, and 4 patients had cataract events after 365 days of treatment.  
Two of the 11 enzalutamide-treated patients had a medical history of cataracts, although this condition 
may have been underreported as the CRF included only medical history considered clinically relevant 
for participation in the study.  These 11 patients had no clear increase in risk factors (eg, higher 
incidence of corticosteroid use or diabetes mellitus), and the etiology of this observation remains 
unknown. 
Study Drug-Related Adverse Events in MDV3100-03 
Study drug related adverse events with an absolute increase of ≥ 1% in the enzalutamide group 
compared with the placebo group include diarrhoea, constipation, fatigue, asthenia, peripheral 
oedema, dysgeusia, headache, hot flush, and hypertension (shown in bold font).  Vomiting was the 
only study drug related adverse event with at least a 1% higher absolute incidence in the placebo 
group compared with the enzalutamide group.   
Hypertension was the only grade 3 or higher study drug related adverse event that had a higher 
absolute incidence of at least 0.5% in the enzalutamide group (2.8%) compared with the placebo 
group (0.7%).  By contrast, ECG QT prolonged was the only study drug related grade 3 or higher 
adverse event that had a lower absolute incidence by at least 0.5% in the enzalutamide group (0.0%) 
compared with the placebo group (0.5%).

Adverse events with at least a 1% higher absolute incidence in the enzalutamide group compared with 
the placebo group within the first 90 days of treatment were asthenia, fatigue, restless legs syndrome, 
insomnia, flushing, hot flush, and hypertension.  Adverse events that were more common within the 
first 90 days in the placebo group by at least 1% were generally associated with disease progression 
and included anaemia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, urinary tract 
infection, weight decreased, decreased appetite, arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, groin pain, myalgia, 
pain in extremity, spinal cord compression, dysuria, hydronephrosis, urinary retention, pelvic pain, and 
cough. 
An exposure response analysis for adverse events was performed in both MDV3100-03 and CRPC2.  
Mean/median Cmin concentrations of enzalutamide, M2, and the sum of enzalutamide and M2 were 
similar between the two studies as were exposure quartiles of each analyte.  Results of these exposure 
response analyses showed no clear or consistent relationships between plasma concentrations of 
enzalutamide, M2, and the sum of enzalutamide and M2, and any specific adverse event or group of 
events.  Therefore, there is no plasma concentration threshold in patients receiving enzalutamide 
160 mg orally once daily that is associated with a greater risk of experiencing specific adverse events. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Seizure 
Seizure was identified as a dose-limiting toxicity in the initial dose-escalation study S-3100-1-01 at 
enzalutamide doses ≥ 360 mg daily.  In CRPC2, seizure was reported in < 1% of patients receiving 
enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg daily compared with no patients in the placebo group.  The overall 
incidence of seizure in patients with metastatic CRPC who previously received docetaxel within the 
larger integrated safety population was comparable with the incidence observed in CRPC2 
(approximately 0.7%).   
An increased incidence of seizure was not observed in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic 
CRPC treated with enzalutamide in MDV3100-03 despite the longer duration of exposure and less 
stringent entry criteria in this study (e.g., no exclusion for concomitant medications that lower the 
seizure threshold).  In MDV3100-03, none of the 871 enzalutamide-treated patients had a seizure (or 
event within the narrow standardized MedDRA query [SMQ] of ‘convulsion’) before the data cutoff date 
of 16 Sep 2013 (median safety reporting period of 17.1 months).  By comparison, 1 of the 
844 placebo-treated patients (0.1%) had a seizure before the data cut-off date (median safety 
reporting period of 5.4 months).  After the data cutoff date, 1 enzalutamide-treated patient (0.1%) 
had a seizure.   
One additional seizure was previously reported in a chemotherapy-naïve patient participating in the 
open-label study 9785-CL-0007, leading to an estimated seizure incidence in chemotherapy-naïve 
patients of 0.1% (1 of 967 patients) through the data cut-off date of MDV3100-03 or 0.2% (2 of 
967 patients) including the patient in MDV3100-03 with an event of seizure after the data cut-off date.  
For many events of seizure in the integrated safety population, confounding factors were present that 
could have independently increased the risk of seizure, such as the presence of brain metastases or a 
history of seizure.   
Based on the method described by the MAH for calculation of the event-rate per 100 patient-years 
(PY), the event rate for Convulsions SMQ events was as follows: 
MDV3100-03:   Enzalutamide:  1/1180.07x100 = 0.08474 events per 100 PY   (= 0.85 per 1000 PY) 
Placebo: 
1/541.57x100 = 0.18464 events per 100 PY 
 (= 1.85 per 1000 PY) 
Combined Controlled Population (CCP):

Enzalutamide:  6/1856.85x100 = 0.32312 events per 100 PY   (= 3.2 per 1000 PY) 
Placebo: 
1/713.14x100 = 0.14022 events per 100 PY 
 (= 1.4 per 1000 PY) 
Cardiac disorders 
The overall incidence of adverse events within the Cardiac Disorders system organ class in 
MDV3100-03 was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (10.1% 
vs 7.8%). The incidence of grade 3 or higher cardiac adverse events was higher in the enzalutamide 
group compared with the placebo group of MDV3100-03 (2.8% vs 2.1%). 
The imbalance in events in MDV3100-03 was evaluated further and determined to be a result of longer 
duration of exposure in the enzalutamide group.  The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events 
was comparable between groups within the first 90 days of treatment (0.9% vs 0.8%) and 180 days of 
treatment (1.0% vs 1.3%) and 365 days of treatment (1.7% vs 1.8%).  Additionally, when adjusted 
for length of exposure, the event rates per 100 patient-years were lower in the enzalutamide groups of 
MDV3100-03, CRPC2, and the combined controlled population compared with the placebo groups 
(2.0 vs 3.0 events per 100 patient-years in MDV3100-03, 2.2 vs 5.2 events per 100 patient-years in 
CRPC2, and 2.1 vs 3.5 events per 100 patient-years in the combined controlled population).  Review of 
individual adverse events in these SMQs did not reveal a clear relationship with prior adverse events of 
hypertension or increased blood pressure in either study. 
Review of adverse events within the ‘torsades de pointes / QT prolongation’ narrow SMQ did not reveal 
a safety signal.  The incidence of adverse events of ventricular tachycardia and prolonged QT were 
comparable between treatment groups.  Only 1 enzalutamide treated patient (< 0.1%) in the 
combined controlled population had an event (QT prolongation) leading to dose interruption compared 
with 5 placebo treated patients (0.4%).

Hypertension 
Hypertension (and related terms in the ‘hypertension’ narrow SMQ) was initially identified as an 
adverse drug reaction in CRPC2 (7.0% vs 3.3%), and was also observed with higher incidence in the 
enzalutamide group of MDV3100-03 (13.9% enzalutamide vs 4.7% placebo).  The incidence of 
hypertension events in both treatment groups in MDV3100-03 was higher than in both treatment

groups in CRPC2.  The incidence of hypertension events in the combined open-label studies was 4.7%, 
leading to an overall incidence of 8.8% in the integrated safety population.   
The overall higher incidence of hypertension in both treatment groups of MDV3100-03 compared with 
CRPC2 may be partly due to the longer patient exposures in that study (100% longer exposure in the 
enzalutamide group and 50% longer exposure in the placebo group) as well as heightened awareness 
by patients and investigators.  In addition, patients in MDV3100-03 had higher blood pressure at study 
entry (median baseline systolic 137 mm Hg; median baseline diastolic 79 mm Hg) compared with 
patients in CRPC2 (median baseline systolic 130 mm Hg; median baseline diastolic 75 mm Hg).   
Hypertension was the most common grade 3 or higher event in the enzalutamide group of 
MDV3100-03 (6.8%), and was higher than the placebo group (2.3%).  The high incidence of grade 3 
events may be related in part to the relatively conservative grading scale for hypertension by CTCAE 
(≥ 160 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic), which was adhered to closely by 
investigators.  In addition, hypertension was the most common comorbid condition in this patient 
population at study entry (reported in more than 60% of patients in MDV3100-03), with approximately 
17% of patients entering the study with grade 3 hypertension at baseline (by screening or baseline 
blood pressure values).  In CRPC2, approximately 50% of patients entered the study with a 
documented history of hypertension, and 11% of patients entered the study with grade 3 hypertension 
at baseline (by screening or baseline blood pressure values).   
Hypertension events were more common in patients with a history of hypertension; approximately 
70% of enzalutamide-treated patients with events of hypertension in MDV3100-03 and the combined 
controlled population had a documented medical history of hypertension, without important differences 
between treatment groups.  The incidence of hypertension events was not affected by age at study 
entry.  In both MDV3100-03 and CRPC2, the maximum mean change from baseline in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first few months of enzalutamide treatment and did not worsen 
with time.  Accordingly, approximately half of all events of hypertension in both studies were reported 
within the first 90 days of enzalutamide treatment.  No clear relationship was apparent between the 
increased incidence of hypertension events and subsequent cardiovascular sequelae or renal 
impairment in MDV3100-03 or CRPC2.   
The mechanism of hypertension associated with enzalutamide treatment is unknown.  Hypertension 
was also reported in 22% of chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic CRPC taking abiraterone in 
combination with prednisone [Ryan et al, 2013], but the mechanism of action of hypertension in these 
patients is likely related to increased mineralocorticoid production and fluid retention along with the 
additive effects of corticosteroids.  Enzalutamide treatment is not associated with hypokalemia, fluid 
overload, or other features of mineralocorticoid excess.  In general, the hypertension observed with 
enzalutamide treatment was successfully treated with standard of care measures and rarely required 
treatment discontinuation or dose modification.   
Fatigue 
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer as well as in patients receiving 
androgen deprivation therapy.  Fatigue was a dose-dependent adverse event observed in the phase 1 
dose-escalation study S-3100-1-01, and fatigue (with related terms of asthenia, lethargy, and malaise) 
was reported in a higher percentage of enzalutamide-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in 
CRPC2 (52.3% vs 46.6%).  The incidence of fatigue-related events was also higher in the 
enzalutamide group of MDV3100-03 with a greater difference between treatment groups (48.3% 
vs 35.0%).  The higher incidence of fatigue-related events was restricted to grade 1 and grade 2 
events as the incidence of grade 3 events was identical in MDV3100-03 treatment groups (3.0% each 
group) and CRPC2 (9.0% each group).  In both studies, enzalutamide-treated patients were less likely 
than placebo-treated patients to discontinue treatment because of fatigue, but were more likely to 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 65/92 
 
 
modify dosing because of fatigue.  In general, enzalutamide-treated patients with fatigue who reduced 
the dose to 80 mg or 120 mg daily had resolution of fatigue or improvement to a lower grade.  
A modest trend was observed with a higher incidence of fatigue and asthenia events with older 
patients (≥ 75 years at study entry), although this finding may be confounded by other comorbid 
conditions in older patients.   
When adjusted for length of exposure, event rates per 100 patient-years for fatigue-related events 
were lower in the enzalutamide groups than placebo groups of MDV3100-03 (44.6 vs 60.9 events per 
100 patient-years) and CRPC2 (78.0 vs 127.5 events per 100 patient-years).  However, the cumulative 
incidence of fatigue-related events was consistently higher in the enzalutamide groups compared with 
the placebo groups of MDV3100-03 and the combined controlled population.  In summary, grade 1 
and 2 fatigue appears to be more prominent as an adverse drug reaction in the earlier-stage patient 
population of MDV3100-03.  The aetiology of fatigue is difficult to discern as it may also be related to 
disease progression, progressive weakness associated with androgen deprivation therapy, and 
concomitant pain medications that are commonly used as the disease advances.   
Hot Flush 
Hot flush is a common side effect of androgen deprivation therapy reported in up to 50% to 80% of 
men with castrate levels of testosterone [Grossman & Zajac, 2011].  The exact mechanism of action is 
not known, although it is believed that a reduction of sex hormone levels causes thermoregulatory 
instability in the hypothalamus.  Hot flush combined with flushing was among the adverse events with 
the largest absolute difference between treatment groups in MDV3100-03 (20.0% vs 7.9%).  Nearly all 
events were grade 1 or grade 2; only 1 enzalutamide-treated patient had a grade 3 event.  Hot flush 
was also observed at a substantially increased incidence in enzalutamide-treated patients compared 
with placebo-treated patients in the combined controlled population (20.4% vs 8.7%), but the event 
did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any patient in either study.  When adjusted for length of 
exposure, the event rates per 100 patient-years for hot flush and flushing were higher in the 
enzalutamide group.  The aetiology of the increased incidence of hot flush with enzalutamide treatment 
may result from a more complete inhibition of androgen signalling pathways.   
Falls/Non-pathological Fractures 
An increased incidence of falls was noted in patients treated with enzalutamide compared with placebo 
in MDV3100-03 (11.6% vs 5.3%), with both groups having a higher incidence of falls compared with 
the earlier CRPC2 study (4.5% vs 1.3%), likely due to the longer exposure time. In addition, as fall 
was observed as an adverse drug reaction in CRPC2, there was heightened vigilance in querying for 
and reporting fall events in MDV3100-03.  Most falls were grade 1 or grade 2 in the combined 
controlled population, and most falls in the enzalutamide group were reported after at least 6 months 
of treatment.  The incidence of falls increased with increasing patient age at study entry in the 
enzalutamide groups, although the same pattern was also observed for falls in the placebo groups of 
the controlled studies.  The aetiology of the increased risk of falls is unknown, but may be 
multifactorial with possible contributing factors such as weakness associated with androgen 
deprivation, other concurrent adverse events, and concomitant medication use.  The events of fall 
were not associated with an increased incidence of loss of consciousness or subdural hematoma.  
Where additional descriptive information was available from verbatim terms, falls were most often 
categorized as mechanical/accidental falls.   
The increased incidence of falls in enzalutamide-treated patients appears to be associated with an 
increased incidence and tendency toward non-pathological fractures in both MDV3100-03 (7.8% 
vs 3.0%) and CRPC2 (4.1% vs 0.8%).  Similar to events of fall, the majority of non-pathological 
fractures were reported after 6 months of treatment, which may explain the higher incidence in 
MDV3100-03 compared with CRPC2.  When evaluating the correlation between falls and non-
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 66/92 
 
 
pathological fractures, it was determined that approximately 50% of patients with a non-pathological 
fracture experienced a fall within the preceding 14 days in MDV3100-03.  Both falls and non-
pathological fractures were rarely associated with discontinuation of treatment or dose modification in 
either treatment group of either study.  When adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate per 
100 patient-years of falls and non-pathological fractures were higher in the enzalutamide groups of 
MDV3100-03, CRPC2, and the combined controlled population.  The higher risk of fracture associated 
with fall in the enzalutamide groups may be related to longer exposure.   
Mental Impairment 
The incidence of cognitive and memory impairment-related adverse events under the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) high-level group term of mental impairment disorders 
was higher in the enzalutamide group of MDV3100-03 than CRPC2 (5.7% vs 1.5%), and the incidence 
was similar to that observed in CRPC2 (4.3% vs 1.8%) despite the longer exposure time in 
MDV3100-03.  In the combined controlled population, nearly all events were grade 1 or 2 in severity 
(5.0% vs 1.6%); only 2 patients in each treatment group experienced grade 3 events (≤ 0.2%).  No 
enzalutamide-treated patient in the combined controlled population experienced a serious adverse 
event involving mental impairment compared with 2 placebo-treated patients in MDV3100-03.  Events 
involving mental impairment rarely led to discontinuation or modification of dosing, with no differences 
between treatment groups.  When adjusted for length of exposure, event rates per 100 patient-years 
for mental impairment were higher in the enzalutamide groups than the placebo groups of 
MDV3100-03, CRPC2, and the combined controlled population.  There was no evidence of an increase 
in road traffic accidents or other serious injuries resulting from mental impairment events in either 
treatment group of the combined controlled population.  The etiology of these cognitive changes is 
unknown, although memory impairment and cognitive changes have also been observed with other 
drugs that inhibit the androgen signaling pathway [Nelson et al, 2008].   
Neutropenia 
The overall incidence of neutropenia or related adverse event terms was infrequent but slightly higher 
in the enzalutamide group of MDV3100-03 (1.5% enzalutamide vs 0.6% placebo).  Based on central 
laboratory values, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was similar between treatment groups 
(0.9% vs 0.7%).  An increased incidence of neutropenia was previously observed in the earlier CRPC2 
study when assessed by grade 3 or 4 central laboratory values (1.1% vs 0%), but not by adverse 
event terms (1.4% vs 1.3%).  In both studies, mean neutrophil counts were below baseline at 
postbaseline time points in the enzalutamide groups, but the maximum decrease was smaller and 
occurred later in MDV3100-03 (maximum mean decrease of approximately 560 cells/µL at week 97) 
compared with CRPC2 (maximum mean decrease of approximately 680 cells/µL at week 5) during the 
relevant study periods.  Only 1 enzalutamide-treated patient experienced a serious adverse event of 
neutropenia in the combined controlled population (< 0.1%).  In general, events of neutropenia were 
transient, did not require treatment discontinuation or dose modification, and were not related to an 
increased risk of infection in either treatment group.  Enzalutamide was not associated with changes in 
red blood cells, platelets, or other white blood cells.  The mechanism for neutropenia associated with 
enzalutamide treatment is not known.   
Headache 
Headache is a common adverse event in clinical studies, in patients with advanced cancer, and in 
patients receiving androgen deprivation therapies and was assessed as an adverse drug reaction for 
enzalutamide.  The incidence of headache was 2-fold higher in enzalutamide-treated patients 
compared with placebo-treated patients in CRPC2 (12.1% vs 5.5%); however, the difference in 
incidence of headaches was smaller in MDV3100-03 (10.4% vs 7.0%), and the incidence was lower in 
the combined open-label population (7.7%). In the combined controlled population, most events were 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 67/92 
 
 
grade 1 or 2; ≤ 0.5% of patients experienced grade 3 events of headache, with no clear difference 
between treatment groups.  Headache events were generally reported early, with over half of all 
events reported within the first 90 days of treatment.  When adjusted for length of exposure, the event 
rate for headache was lower in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group of 
MDV3100-03 (9.9 vs 12.4 events per 100 patient-years) but higher in the enzalutamide group of 
CRPC2 (16.6 vs 14.1 events per 100 patient-years).  The etiology for the increased incidence in the 
more advanced patients of CRPC2 compared with MDV3100-03 is not known; potential reasons may 
include increased use of concomitant medications associated with headache such as opiates or 
manifestations of disease progression (e.g., skull metastases) that are more common in patients with 
later-stage disease.   
Anxiety 
Anxiety was assessed as an adverse drug reaction in the original marketing application as a result of a 
higher incidence in the enzalutamide group of CRPC2 (6.4% vs 4.0%) as well as a pattern of dose 
dependence in open-label studies.  In MDV3100-03, the overall incidence of anxiety and the difference 
in incidence between treatment groups was lower (3.8% vs 2.6%), despite the longer exposure 
duration.  Although an increased incidence of anxiety in the enzalutamide group was observed within 
the first 90 and 180 days of CRPC2 (4.5% vs 3.3% within the first 90 days and 5.4% vs 3.3% within 
the first 180 days), a lower incidence of anxiety was observed within the first 90 and 180 days of 
MDV3100-03 (0.8% vs 1.4% within the first 90 days, 1.8% vs 2.1% in the within the first 180 days).  
In MDV3100-03, no enzalutamide-treated patient had a grade 3 or higher event or an event leading to 
treatment discontinuation or dose modification.  When adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate 
was lower in the enzalutamide group in MDV3100-03 (2.9 vs 4.1 events per 100 patient-years) and in 
CRPC2 (8.0 vs 9.4 events per 100 patient-years).  The etiology of the increased incidence of anxiety 
associated with enzalutamide treatment is unknown.   
Hallucination 
Hallucination was identified as an adverse drug reaction in CRPC2 after a finding of increased incidence 
in the enzalutamide group (1.6% vs 0.3%), and were primarily events of visual hallucination.  In 
CRPC2, nearly all patients were receiving concomitant opiate medications at the time of the 
hallucination event.  The incidence of hallucination events was 0.9% in the combined open-label 
studies, which are also largely composed of patients who previously received docetaxel.  An increased 
incidence of hallucination was not observed in MDV3100-03.  One patient in each treatment group 
(0.1%) experienced an event of hallucination, and similar to CRPC2, both patients were receiving 
concomitant opiate medications at the time of the event.  A total of 23 patients (0.9%) in the 
integrated safety population experienced events of hallucination, of whom only 1 enzalutamide-treated 
patient in CRPC2 experienced a grade 3 event.  The aetiology of hallucination in patients with 
advanced CRPC is not known, but use of opiate-containing medications appears to be a confounding 
factor.   
Dry Skin/Pruritus 
Events of dry skin and pruritus were considered adverse drug reactions in CRPC2 as a result of higher 
incidences in the enzalutamide group (3.5% vs 1.3% for dry skin, 3.8% vs 1.3% for pruritus) along 
with higher event rates when adjusted for length of exposure.  In addition, both of these events have 
been described with other antiandrogen treatments [bicalutamide prescribing information; nilutamide 
prescribing information].  In MDV3100-03, the overall incidences of these events were lower than in 
CRPC2 for both groups, and although the incidences were higher in the enzalutamide group than the 
placebo group, the differences between groups were smaller (< 1%) and not considered clinically 
relevant.  Additionally, in MDV3100-03, the event rate per 100 patient-years for each of these events 
was lower in the enzalutamide group when adjusted for length of exposure.

Gynecomastia 
An increased incidence of gynecomastia was observed in the enzalutamide group of MDV3100-03 
(3.3% enzalutamide vs 1.3% placebo), although when adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate 
was only marginally higher in the enzalutamide group (2.5 vs 2.0 events per 100 patient-years).  An 
increased incidence of gynecomastia was also observed in CRPC2 (2.5% vs 1.0%), although the 
absolute difference between groups was smaller.  Approximately half of gynecomastia events in 
enzalutamide-treated patients occurred in the first 90 days of treatment in both the combined 
controlled population and the integrated safety population.  All events of gynecomastia in the 
combined controlled population were grade 1 or 2 in severity, except 1 enzalutamide-treated patient in 
CRPC2 had grade 3 gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia did not lead to treatment discontinuation or dose 
modification in any patient in the integrated safety population.  In the phase 2 study of enzalutamide 
monotherapy in hormone-naïve patients with prostate cancer, the incidence of gynecomastia was 
nearly 50%.  The etiology of gynecomastia associated with enzalutamide treatment is likely related to 
its primary pharmacology of androgen receptor inhibition and has also been reported with other 
antiandrogens [bicalutamide prescribing information].  Given the consistent increase in incidence in 
enzalutamide-treated patients across studies as well as the pharmacologic basis, gynecomastia is 
considered an adverse drug reaction.   
Restless Legs Syndrome 
Restless legs syndrome was reported in a higher proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients in 
MDV3100-03 (2.1% vs 0.4%) and CRPC2 (1.5% vs 0.3%).  In the integrated safety population, the 
incidence was 1.8%.  Nearly all events in the integrated safety population were grade 1 or grade 2; 
only 1 enzalutamide-treated patient experienced a grade 3 event in MDV3100-03.  Approximately 91% 
of the events of restless legs syndrome across studies were reported within the first 90 days of 
treatment.  When adjusted for length of exposure, the event rate per 100 patient-years was higher in 
the enzalutamide groups of MDV3100-03, CRPC2, and the combined controlled population.  Restless 
legs syndrome was reported as a medical history event in 1.3% of MDV3100-03 patients and 1.1% of 
CRPC2 patients, although this may be an underestimate as the overall prevalence in North America 
and Europe has been estimated at 5% to 10%.  The etiology of restless legs syndrome associated with 
enzalutamide is unknown.  Other medications such as centrally acting antihistamines, serotonergic 
antidepressants, and dopamine-blocking antiemetics have been linked to initiation or worsening of 
restless legs syndrome, but it has not been consistently reported with antiandrogens.  Although the 
incidence is low across studies, given the consistency of findings and the occurrence within the first 
90 days of treatment, restless legs syndrome is considered an adverse drug reaction. 
Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified 
A higher incidence of events of second malignancy, including non-melanoma skin cancer, was observed 
in the MDV3100-03 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (3.9% vs 1.1%; 
3.1 vs 0.7% excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer).  A smaller imbalance was observed in CRPC2 (1.0% 
vs 0.5% for all second malignancies).  When adjusted for length of exposure in MDV3100-03, the 
event rate remained higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group 
(3.3 vs 1.8 events per 100 patient-years for any second malignancy, and 2.0 vs 0.7 events per 
100 patient-years for any grade 3 or higher second malignancy).  In CRPC2, the event rates were 
comparable or lower in the enzalutamide group relative to placebo (1.2 vs 1.2 events per 
100 patient-years for any second malignancy, and 0.6 vs 1.2 events per 100 patient-years for any 
grade 3 or higher second malignancy). There was no overall pattern by anatomic location or cell type 
for the other events of second malignancy observed in enzalutamide-treated patients 
Excluding the events of non-melanoma skin cancer, 40 enzalutamide-treated patients (1.6%) in the 
integrated safety population and 8 placebo-treated patients in the combined controlled population 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 69/92 
 
 
(0.6%) experienced 50 adverse events of second malignancy.  In order to provide context for the 
limited size of the integrated studies database, the observed incidence of second malignancy 
(excluding non-melanoma skins cancer) in the enzalutamide integrated safety population was 
compared with the expected overall incidence of malignancy, and the incidence of each type of 
malignancy, using cancer statistics data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
Program database (www.seer.cancer.gov). The overall incidence of second malignancy in the 
40 enzalutamide-treated patients in the integrated safety population is within the expected incidence 
for all cancer sites combined per SEER-18 (64 events expected in a population ≥ 65 years).  Further, 
there was no overall pattern of higher than expected incidence by anatomic location or cell type, with 
some malignancies occurring at higher than expected frequency in the SEER data (e.g., tonsil, gastric) 
and others at lower than expected frequency (e.g., lung). 
A review of postmarketing adverse events of Xtandi (enzalutamide) capsules (data collected through 
31 Oct 2013) did not identify a safety signal in the Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified 
system organ class.  In the postmarketing data, events considered unrelated to prostate cancer include 
6 patients with hematologic malignancy (2 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and 1 patient each 
with chronic myeloid leukaemia, unspecified hematologic malignancy, leukaemia, and lymphoma), and 
1 patient each with bladder cancer, colon cancer, small cell lung cancer metastatic, testis cancer, and 
cholangiocarcinoma.  Events considered likely to be associated with underlying prostate cancer 
included malignant neoplasm (unspecified, 4 patients), bone cancer (3 patients), and lymphangiosis 
carcinomatosa (1 patient).  A causal relationship with enzalutamide could not be established due to the 
limited clinical information available through spontaneous reporting.   
Although no carcinogenicity studies have been performed with enzalutamide (per ICH S9), nonclinical 
studies have not revealed evidence of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, or mutagenicity..   
Based on the overall incidence rate of second malignancy consistent with the SEER-18 data, second 
malignancies observed across different organ systems and cell types, median onset latency of second 
malignancies of 199 days (a relatively short latency) in enzalutamide-treated patients in the integrated 
safety population, and evidence of pre-existing malignancy in some patients at study entry, a causal 
relationship between enzalutamide treatment and second malignancy is unlikely. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, deaths from prostate cancer disease progression, deaths from other causes (unrelated to 
prostate cancer disease progression) and deaths from unknown (or unspecified) causes were all lower 
in the enzalutamide group than the placebo group.  Two patients (1 in the enzalutamide group and 1 in 
the placebo group) died within 30 days of initiation of study drug.  The enzalutamide-treated patient 
died of unknown causes at home, the placebo-treated patient died of an acute subdural hematoma 
associated with a fall.   
Deaths within 30 days of discontinuation of study drug were higher in the enzalutamide group 
compared with the placebo group (4.0% vs 3.4%), with the small overall difference resulting from 
deaths due to other causes (unrelated to prostate cancer) and unknown (or unspecified) causes.  The 
proportion of patients with deaths due to prostate cancer was similar between treatment groups.  Most 
deaths within 30 days of discontinuation of study drug are within the treatment-emergent period and 
are also reported as adverse events leading to death, although 5 deaths (2 in the enzalutamide group 
and 3 in the placebo group) were after the reporting period (e.g., patients who discontinued study 
drug and immediately initiated cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to death).

Of the 37 deaths reported during the treatment-emergent period in the enzalutamide group, 
investigators assessed on the end of study CRF that 17 patients had death due to disease progression, 
16 patients had death due to causes other than disease progression, and 4 had death due to unknown 
(or unspecified) causes.  Of the 32 deaths reported during the treatment-emergent period in the 
placebo group, investigators assessed that 18 patients had causes of death assessed as due to disease 
progression, 13 as due to causes other than disease progression, and 1 due to unknown causes. A 
slightly higher incidence of treatment-emergent deaths was due to causes unrelated to prostate cancer 
in the enzalutamide group (18 patients, 2.1%) compared with the placebo group (13 patients, 1.5%) 
Of these, a total of 9 enzalutamide-treated patients (1.0%) and 5 placebo-treated patients (0.6%) died 
of cardiovascular-related causes during the treatment-emergent period; most of these patients had 
multiple cardiac risk factors.  Of note, only 1 patient in each treatment group had an adverse event of 
hypertension prior to a cardiovascular-related death.   
A review of sudden or unexpected deaths due to unknown causes reported with different preferred 
terms under different system organ classes did not reveal any safety finding associated with 
enzalutamide treatment.  Review of the narratives for all patients with adverse events leading to death 
revealed 16 patients with sudden and/or unexpected deaths:  10 patients (1.1%) in the enzalutamide 
group and 6 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group.  Nearly all of these patients had significant cardiac 
risk factors at baseline, and patients in both treatment groups had occasional episodes of increased 
blood pressure and/or prolonged QTcF interval with no clear difference between treatment groups.  
When adjusted for exposure duration, the event rates of sudden or unexpected death were lower in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (0.8 vs 1.1 events per 100 patient-years).   
Deaths from accidents or acute injuries during the treatment-emergent period included 1 patient in the 
enzalutamide group (accidental drowning) and 2 patients in the placebo group (road traffic accident 
and subdural hematoma).  One patient in each treatment group died of a second malignancy during 
the treatment-emergent period (1 enzalutamide-treated patient died of rectal cancer diagnosed on 
study day 8 and 1 placebo-treated patient died of lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed on study day 58). 
One patient in each treatment group died of infectious causes during the treatment-emergent period. 
Serious AEs 
Patients treated with enzalutamide in MDV3100-03 had a higher overall incidence of serious adverse 
events than patients treated with placebo (32.0% vs 26.8%); however, the difference between groups 
is primarily due to the longer duration of exposure in the enzalutamide group.  When serious adverse 
events are compared by treatment group within the first 90 days, 180 days, and 365 days of 
treatment, the incidences of these events was lower in the enzalutamide group.  The imbalance toward 
a higher incidence in the enzalutamide group is observed only after 1 year of treatment, when 
67.8% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 18.0% of patients in the placebo group remained on 
study drug treatment.  Similarly, the median time to the first serious adverse event is longer in the 
enzalutamide group than the placebo group (not yet reached vs 23.3 months).

Table 43: Summary of serious adverse events by increasing exposure time in MDV3100-03 
A review of major system organ classes (i.e., those with more than 5 patients with adverse events in 
either treatment group) revealed that nearly all have a lower proportion of patients with serious 
adverse events within the first 90 days and 180 days of treatment.  Vascular Disorders was the only 
system organ class with a higher proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients within the first 180 days 
of treatment (0.5% each group within 90 days; 1.0% enzalutamide vs 0.7% placebo within 180 days). 
No serious adverse event terms were reported with at least a 1% higher absolute incidence in the 
enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group.  Hydronephrosis was the only serious adverse 
event with at least a 1% higher incidence in the placebo group compared with the enzalutamide group 
(1.3% placebo vs 0% enzalutamide).  Serious adverse events with at least a 0.5% higher absolute 
incidence in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group included anemia, coronary 
artery disease, fatigue, femoral neck fracture, pathological fracture, syncope, cauda equina syndrome, 
and hypertension.  Serious adverse events reported in the placebo group with at least a 0.5% higher 
absolute incidence compared with the enzalutamide group included disease progression, hematuria, 
hydronephrosis, and obstructive uropathy.

The proportion of patients with serious adverse events of anemia was higher in the enzalutamide group 
overall, but lower within the first 90 days (0.1% enzalutamide vs 0.6% placebo) and 180 days (0.6% 
vs 0.7%) of treatment.  The same finding is true for the incidence of pathological fractures within the 
first 90 days (0.2% enzalutamide vs 0.4% placebo) and 180 days (0.2% vs 0.5%) of treatment.  
Cauda equina syndrome was not reported in the placebo group, but most events in the enzalutamide 
group occurred after at least 180 days of treatment. 
Overall, study drug-related serious adverse events were reported infrequently with no significant 
difference between treatment groups (2.9% of enzalutamide-treated patients vs 2.6% of 
placebo-treated patients).  Acute renal failure (0.3% enzalutamide vs 0.1% placebo) and pulmonary 
embolism (0% vs 0.4%) were the only serious adverse events assessed as related to study drug 
reported in more than 2 patients (0.2%) in either treatment group. 
Other significant events 
There are no indications of enzalutamide causing nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, substantial 
gastrointestinal toxicities, or an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. While keeping the 
increased risk of hypertension in mind, no association with major adverse cardiovascular events or 
QTc-prolongation was observed.

Laboratory findings 
An association of enzalutamide treatment with decreased leukocyte and neutrophil counts was 
identified in both controlled studies. A review of clinical laboratory-related adverse events in the 
Investigations system organ class did not reveal any imbalances to suggest a safety signal apart from 
the imbalances in neutropenia/leukopenia.   
Treatment with enzalutamide was not associated with any clinically significant changes in liver function 
tests, nor in renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium).  No clinically 
relevant mean changes relative to baseline values or to the placebo group were noted for hemoglobin 
levels, platelets, sodium, chloride, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, or creatinine kinase levels over 
time.  Although a greater proportion of patients had central laboratory CTCAE grade 1 hyperglycemia 
in the enzalutamide groups of MDV3100-03 and the combined controlled population compared with the 
placebo groups (73.0% vs 59.5% in MDV3100-03; 74.2% vs 62.1% in the combined controlled 
population), there was no difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients with a 
toxicity change of 2 or more in elevated glucose (4.6% vs 4.3% in MDV3100-03; 3.7% vs 4.0% in the 
combined controlled population), or the proportion of patients with grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (4.0% 
vs 3.0% in MDV3100-03; 3.1% vs 2.8% in the combined controlled population).  Furthermore, the 
proportion of patients with events in the narrow SMQ of ‘hyperglycemia’ was lower in the enzalutamide 
groups compared with the placebo groups (2.9% vs 3.6% in MDV3100-03; 2.0% vs 3.2% in the 
combined controlled population.  Consistent with antitumor activity, enzalutamide treatment was 
associated with decreases in LDH and alkaline phosphatase levels over time compared to baseline and 
compared with placebo treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
Of the 1671 patients in the phase 3 trials who received enzalutamide, 1261 patients (75%) were 65 
years and over and 516 patients (31%) were 75 years and over.  
A trend toward increasing incidence of adverse events with increasing age was observed in both the 
enzalutamide and placebo groups. An increased incidence of fatigue and asthenia was observed with 
increasing age in the enzalutamide group of the combined controlled population and integrated safety 
population that was not apparent in the placebo group of the combined controlled population.  The 
Xtandi 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/607459/2014 
Page 78/92 
 
 
increasing incidence of falls and peripheral edema with increasing age were observed in the 
enzalutamide and placebo groups, although the rates were generally lower in the placebo group.  
A reverse trend was observed for some common adverse events such as hot flush, musculoskeletal 
pain, insomnia and headache, where younger patients experienced increased incidence over older 
patients in both enzalutamide and placebo groups.  The incidence of other adverse events was not 
significantly affected by age. In general, an increased incidence of non-pathological fracture was 
observed with increasing age in both treatment groups, consistent with the increased incidence of fall.  
No clear effect of age was observed on the incidence of hypertension, mental impairment, or seizure 
adverse events. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Differences were observed with regard to use of concomitant medication in the enzalutamide and 
placebo arms, respectively, in study MDV3100-03. The largest difference between treatment groups 
with respect to ATC level 2 drug categories was seen with antibacterials for systemic use (35.9% in the 
enzalutamide group and 28.9% in the placebo group), anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products 
(50.5% and 44.9%), agents acting on renin-angiotensin system (50.4% and 45.0%), and anti-
anaemic preparations (13.0% and 7.8%), and analgesics (64.3% enzalutamide and 59.8% placebo).

The proportion of patients with adverse events that were the primary reason for discontinuation of 
study drug in MDV3100-03 was comparable between treatment groups (5.6% enzalutamide 
vs 6.0% placebo).  A review of these adverse events by system organ class revealed that General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions was the only system organ class with a difference of at 
least 1% between treatment groups and demonstrated a lower incidence in the enzalutamide group 
(0.2% enzalutamide vs 1.3% placebo).  This imbalance was primarily due to events of fatigue as the 
primary reason for discontinuation of study drug, reported in 2 patients (0.2%) in the enzalutamide 
group and 8 patients (0.9%) in the placebo group.  One additional placebo-treated patient 
discontinued treatment primarily due to an event of asthenia, and 2 additional placebo-treated patients 
discontinued treatment primarily due to lethargy. Adverse events that were the primary reason for 
discontinuation of study drug reported in more than 1 patient in either treatment group and were more 
common in the enzalutamide group included cerebrovascular accident, syncope, and acute renal 
failure. 
Table 47: Adverse events as the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug reported in more 
than 1 patient in either treatment group by system organ class in MDV3100-03 
Of the patients with adverse events that were the primary reason for treatment discontinuation, less 
than half in each treatment group were assessed as study drug-related, and the incidence was lower in 
the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (2.1% vs 2.8%). The study drug-related 
adverse events that were the primary reason for treatment discontinuation in more than 1 patient in 
either treatment group included acute renal failure (0.2% enzalutamide vs 0% placebo), nausea (0.2% 
vs 0.4%), fatigue (0.2% vs 0.8%), and hepatic enzymes increased (0% vs 0.2%) 
The proportion of patients with adverse events associated with discontinuation of study drug in 
MDV3100-03 was lower in the enzalutamide group than the placebo group (17.0% enzalutamide 
vs 25.6% placebo).  Back pain was the only adverse event associated with discontinuation of study 
drug that was more common in the enzalutamide group by at least 0.5% (2.2% vs 1.7%).  Adverse

events associated with discontinuation of study drug that were more common in the placebo group by 
at least 0.5% included dysphagia (0% enzalutamide vs 0.5% placebo), fatigue (0.7% vs 1.8%), 
decreased appetite (0% vs 0.6%), bone pain (0.9% vs 3.2%), musculoskeletal pain (0.1% vs 0.6%), 
spinal cord compression (1.1% vs 1.9%), lethargy (0% vs 0.6%), hematuria (0% vs 0.5%), and 
hydronephrosis (0% vs 0.5%). 
Dose Interruption 
The proportion of patients with adverse events leading to dose interruption in MDV3100-03 was 
modestly higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (11.3% enzalutamide 
vs 10.4% placebo).  Within each system organ class, the absolute difference in incidence between 
treatment groups was less than 1%.  The only adverse events with an incidence at least 0.5% higher 
in the enzalutamide group were asthenia (0.7% enzalutamide vs 0.1% placebo), vomiting (0.6% vs 
0.1%), and renal failure (0.5% vs 0%).  The increase in asthenia events was offset by a lower 
incidence of events of fatigue (0.5% enzalutamide vs 0.8% placebo) and a comparable incidence of 
events of malaise (0.1% vs 0.1%).  The increase in acute renal failure events was offset by a lower 
incidence of obstructive uropathy (0.1% enzalutamide vs 0.4% placebo) and acute prerenal failure 
(0% vs 0.1%).  Adverse events leading to dose interruption with an incidence at least 0.5% higher in 
the placebo group compared with the enzalutamide group were ECG QT prolonged (0% enzalutamide 
vs 0.6% placebo), decreased appetite (0.3% vs 0.8%), and dehydration (0% vs 0.6%).  The 
incidences of the remainder of events were comparable between treatment groups. 
Study drug-related adverse leading to dose interruption were less common in the enzalutamide group 
compared with the placebo group (3.1% vs 4.4%).  No study drug-related events leading to dose 
interruption were reported with at least 0.5% increased incidence in the enzalutamide group compared 
with the placebo group.  Study drug-related adverse events leading to dose interruption reported with 
at least 0.5% increased incidence in the placebo group compared with the enzalutamide group included 
ECG QT prolonged (0% enzalutamide vs 0.6% placebo) and decreased appetite (0.1% vs 0.8%) 
Dose Reduction 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction in MDV3100-03 were infrequent in both treatment groups, 
although the proportion of patients with adverse events leading to temporary dose reduction was 
higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (2.1% vs 0.9%).  No system organ 
class was represented by more than 1% of patients in either treatment group and no adverse event 
was reported with at least a 0.5% difference in incidence between treatment groups.  Fatigue was the 
only adverse event reported in at least 0.5% of patients in a treatment group (0.5% enzalutamide 
vs 0.1% placebo).  An additional enzalutamide-treated patient experienced an event of asthenia 
leading to dose reduction.  In each enzalutamide-treated patient, the dose reduction (to 80 mg or 
120 mg daily) led to resolution of the fatigue event or improvement to a lower grade. 
Post marketing experience 
Enzalutamide was commercially available as Xtandi in the US in September 2012.  In Europe, 
enzalutamide was initially made available in France through a temporary authorization for use (ATU) in 
April 2013.  Between June 2013 and October 2013, enzalutamide was marketed in Austria, Canada, 
Denmark, Finland Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.   
Based on estimates obtained from Source Healthcare Analytics, the average treatment duration with 
enzalutamide in the US was 4.3 months through September 2013.  Reliable estimates were not 
available for other markets, so patient treatment years (PTY) is provided as the unit of patient 
exposure.

The enzalutamide post marketing exposure estimates are based on internal sales data for all countries.  
These internal sales data represent product shipment from manufacturer to distributor (i.e., 
wholesaler, specialty pharmacy, etc).  The initial sales of the product represent distributor stocking of 
the product.  This may result in an overestimate of patient exposure following initial marketing. 
A cumulative review and evaluation of post marketing serious adverse events for Xtandi 
(enzalutamide) was performed for all cases reported through 31 October 2013. Xtandi was first 
approved in the US on 31 August 2012. 
A search of the global safety database was conducted on 08 November 2013 to retrieve all post 
marketing cases with at least 1 serious adverse event reported during the review period.  The case 
report types include spontaneous cases, cases received from regulatory authorities, compassionate use 
cases, and investigator initiated trials cases. The post marketing serious and non-serious cases were 
also reviewed for events of interest.   
A total of 1803 cases with at least 1 serious adverse event were reported during this review period, 
including 1278 spontaneous cases, 521 compassionate use cases, 3 cases received from a regulatory 
authority (European Union), and 1 investigator initiated trial case.  These cases contained a total of 
3093 serious adverse events, of which the most commonly reported events were from the system 
organ class of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (718 events), Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant, and Unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) (641 events), and Nervous System Disorders (253 
events).   
A review of all post marketing serious adverse events and events of interest reported through 31 
October 2013 revealed no new safety information.   
One Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for the review period of 21 June 2013 to 20 December 2013 
was submitted with a due date of 28 February 2014.  The cumulative review detected no new safety 
signals or warranted any label changes during the reference period. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database of enzalutamide encompasses 2509 patients treated with enzalutamide plus 
standard of care. Of them, 967 patients (38.5%) did not receive prior docetaxel and therefore are 
considered the target population for this application of new indication. Within the main study 
(MDV3100-03, PREVAIL) the median treatment duration for the enzalutamide group was 16.6 months 
compared with 4.6 months for the placebo group, which intuitively foresee a higher incidence of AEs.  
Overall, the treatment with enzalutamide was well tolerated, since the dose reductions, interruptions 
and discontinuations were similar or slightly higher for enzalutamide. 
Regarding common AEs, the incidence of AEs in the MDV3100-03 study was high in both groups. More 
than 90% of patients had some AEs. Fatigue, back pain, constipation, arthralgia, decreased appetite, 
diarrhoea, hot flush, asthenia, weight decreased, peripheral oedema, hypertension, headache, fall, 
dizziness, haematuria, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, dysgeusia, and upper respiratory tract infection 
were the most reported AEs for enzalutamide when compared to placebo (AEs reported in at least 5% 
of patients in either treatment group with at least a 2% absolute increased incidence in the 
enzalutamide vs placebo). 
When the AEs reported were adjusted for length of exposure, hot flush, hypertension, fall, and 
dysgeusia, were higher for patients treated with enzalutamide. Hypertension, fall, hot flush, dysgeusia, 
and upper respiratory tract infection were approximately twice more frequently reported in the 
enzalutamide arm. According to the investigators, diarrhoea, constipation, fatigue, asthenia, peripheral 
oedema, dysgeusia, headache, hot flush, and hypertension were probably related to the study drug.

The term gynaecomastia was not presented in the summary table provided by the MAH with 5% 
frequency cut-off. However, according to the source data the frequencies were 3.3% vs. 1.3% in the 
enzalutamide arm vs. placebo arm in study MDV3100-3, it has therefore been included in the section 
4.8 of the SmPC under frequency “common”. 
Grade 3 or higher AEs more frequently reported in the enzalutamide arm versus placebo were cataract 
(1.3% vs 0.1%) nausea (1.0% vs 0.5%) general physical health deterioration (2.1% vs 1.2%) 
pneumonia (1.3% vs 0.8%) fall (1.4% vs 0.7%) spinal cord compression (3.8% vs 2.8%) syncope 
(1.6% vs 0.9%) and hypertension (6.8% vs 2.3%). However, only hypertension and cataract remained 
higher in the enzalutamide arm after adjusting for the longer safety reporting period. 
Fatigue, hot flush, hypertension, fall, mental impairment, neutropenia, hallucinations, seizure, fatal 
infections, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity and cardiac disorders were considered AEs of special interest in 
the pre-docetaxel setting. Of them, hallucinations, seizure, fatal infections, hepatotoxicity and renal 
toxicity were not considered associated with the treatment of enzalutamide. Fatigue, hot flush, 
hypertension, fall, mental impairment, neutropenia and cardiac disorders had a higher rate of incidence 
in the patients treated with enzalutamide. Hypertension was clearly associated to enzalutamide, being 
the most reported AEs grade 3-4 (6.8%). The incidence of falls was numerically higher for the 
enzalutamide group (11.6% vs 5.3%). However, it was evenly balanced within the 180 days of 
treatment. This AE could be associated to non-pathological fractures (7.8% enzalutamide vs 3.0% 
placebo) or even seizures. Cardiac disorders, despite the higher incidence in AEs (10.1% enzalutamide 
vs 7.8% placebo) and grade 3-4 (2.8% vs 2.1%) were lower in the enzalutamide group when adjusted 
for length of exposure. 
With regard to the important identified risk of hallucination, no difference between arms was observed 
in MDV3100-3. An event of hallucination was reported for 1 patient in each treatment group (0.1%). In 
CRPC2 the incidence was higher in the enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (1.6% 
vs. 0.3%). The event rate /100 PY in the enzalutamide arm was higher in CRPC2 (2.2) and the pooled 
uncontrolled studies (1.6) was higher than that in MDV3100-3 (<0.1), despite a longer reporting time 
in the last one. The reason for this difference between studies is not known. The MAH argues that most 
patients with hallucinations were receiving concomitant opiate pain medications. On the basis of the 
data from MDV3100-3, the PRAC and CHMP consider that hallucinations can be removed from the list 
of the safety concerns in the RMP.  
Of note, there was an increased occurrence of cataract in the enzalutamide arm compared with 
placebo in MDV3100-3. It is possible that increasing age and other risk factors increase the risk of 
cataract over time, thereby contributing to a higher time-adjusted rate in the enzalutamide-treated 
arm due to the 3 times longer observation time in this arm. It is also agreed that the time-to-onset is 
low (< 1 year) for most cases, suggesting other causative factors, and for the longer time spans only 
data from the enzalutamide arm is available. It was therefore not included in the SmPC.  
Cognitive/memory impairment was proposed to be upgraded from important potential risk to important 
identified risk in the RMP by the MAH which is endorsed. In MDV3100-3, the rate of the MedDRA HLGT 
term of mental impairment disorders was 4.5 vs. 2.8 events/ 100 patient-years in the enzalutamide vs. 
placebo arm. However, due to the low frequencies, the size of the respective problems from a clinical 
perspective appears relatively small. 
In the phase 3 clinical studies, 7 patients (0.4%) experienced a seizure out of 1671 patients treated 
with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide, whereas one patient (<0.1%) receiving placebo 
experienced a seizure. Dose appears to be an important predictor of the risk of seizure, as reflected by 
Xtandi 
Assessment report

Page 83/92 
 
 
 
preclinical data, and data from a dose escalation study. In both phase 3 studies, patients with prior 
seizure or risk factors for seizure were excluded. 
As discussed in the assessment of the initial MAA, enzalutamide penetrates the blood brain barrier and 
has been associated with a potential for seizure in preclinical studies, possibly through binding to the 
GABA receptor. In the clinical setting, seizure was a DLT in the dose-finding study and PK data support 
the relation to dose. In the registration study CRPC2, a higher frequency of seizure was observed than 
placebo (0.8 vs. 0%, 6 vs. 0 patients). In the present pivotal study MDV3100-03, the incidence was 
lower and was the same in both treatment arms, (0.1 vs. 0.1%, 1 vs. 1 patient). The three-fold longer 
observation time in the enzalutamide arm compared to the placebo arm in study CRPC2, as well as in 
study MDV3100-03, should be kept in mind. In that perspective, the difference in seizure events 
between treatment groups in the Combined Controlled Population (CCP; 0.4 vs. 0.1 %) might not be of 
concern.  
Considering the event-rate per 100 patient-years (PY) calculated for convulsions SMQ events, it is 
noted that an increased event rate persists compared with placebo in the combined phase-3 population 
(but not in MDV3100-03 alone), although the small numbers make the estimates uncertain (e.g. if only 
one more patient in the placebo group had a seizure, the event rate would be 2.8/1000= PY, similar to 
the rate in the active arm.) Taken together, the size of the clinical problem of seizures appears small, 
including the added information from MDV3100-03.  
With regard to the eligibility criteria of MDV3100-03 versus CRPC2, the relevant difference in exclusion 
criteria concerned concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. However, the actual use 
of concomitant medications lowering the seizure threshold (that were not allowed in study CRPC2) was 
comparable in both studies as well as between study arms within each study. As a consequence, the 
difference in seizure between the two studies cannot be explained by the difference in the frequency of 
use of these drugs. 
In conclusion, no explanation for the lower incidence of convulsions/seizure in the present MDV3100-
03 compared with previous studies have been presented by the MAH. In the absence of other 
explanations, it is conceivable that this phenomenon could be due to a better identification of study 
participants at risk for seizure at screening. Overall, given the pre-clinical background, the presence of 
a potential mechanism and a dose-response relationship, and the overrepresentation in clinical other 
studies, seizure is still considered an important identified risk.  
Falls are confirmed as a common ADR in MDV3100-03.The incidence of falls was numerically higher for 
the enzalutamide group (11.6% vs 5.3%). However, it was evenly balanced within the 180 days of 
treatment. The review of the clinical documentation associated to falls did not show any relationship 
between these events and seizures. Despite the higher AEs of falls in the enzalutamide group (11.6% 
vs 5.3%) there does not seem to be a clear association with seizures. 
Although the incidence is low across studies, given the consistency of findings and the occurrence 
within the first 90 days of treatment, restless legs syndrome is considered an adverse drug reaction 
and included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Adverse events resulting in death occurred in 37 patients (4.2%) in the enzalutamide group and 32 
patients (3.8%) in the placebo group. Cardiac disorders was reported as AE leading to death in 7 
patients (0.8%) in the enzalutamide group vs 3 patients (0.4%) in the placebo group. 10 patients 
(1.1%) in the enzalutamide group and 6 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group experienced sudden or 
unexpected deaths, mostly due to cardiac or presumed cardiac causes during the study. According to 
the MAH, nearly all patients with a sudden death event had clinically significant cardiac risk factors at 
baseline. Within the profile of serious AEs in a higher frequency for enzalutamide group, coronary

artery disease was one of them (0.5% vs 0%). Once the cardiovascular adverse events have been 
adjusted for exposure duration, the risk is considered less of concern. 
The fact that study MDV3100-03 allowed patients at higher cardiovascular risk as determined by less 
stringent blood pressure entry criteria, patients with a history of arrhythmias requiring treatment, and 
patients with a history of moderate (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II) heart failure could 
have influenced these findings. 
A higher incidence of events of secondary malignancy, including non-melanoma skin cancer, was 
observed in the MDV3100-03 enzalutamide group compared with the placebo group (3.9% vs 1.1%; 
3.1 vs 0.7% excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. The time-adjusted event rate for secondary 
malignancy was also increased in the enzalutamide arm of MDV3100-3 compared to the placebo arm 
(3.3 vs. 1.8 events/ 100 PY) The difference in frequency of second malignancy between study arms in 
MDV3100-3 which persists in time-adjusted analysis is not explained. The numbers are small however, 
and chance findings cannot be ruled out. No difference in the rate of secondary malignancies across 
study arms was seen in time-adjusted analyses of Study CRPC2 (1.2 vs. 1.2 events/ 100 PY). 
Frequencies and cancer types in the enzalutamide arm in MDV3100-3 are overall within expected 
population-based frequencies. Given the relatively short time to onset, it is not likely that the observed 
cases represent a cancer-inducing effect of enzalutamide. Furthermore, as an anti-androgen, there is 
no obvious mechanism for a theoretical cancer-promoting effect of enzalutamide, as androgens 
normally promote growth. In addition, it could be hypothesised that the risk of secondary malignancies 
is not constant over time and that the higher rates of secondary malignancy, also in time-adjusted 
analyses, might partly be caused by other risk factors (age, radiotherapy) acting on the prolonged 
observation time in the enzalutamide arm. Secondary malignancies will continue to be closely 
monitored in PSURs and specifically addressed in the already planned updates from MDV3100-3 to the 
CHMP. 
A total of 241 enzalutamide-treated patients (27.6%) and 299 placebo-treated patients (35.4%) died 
as of the data cut-off date. The vast majority were due to disease progression (21.0% of 
enzalutamide-treated patients and 26.9% of placebo-treated patients). On the contrary, a higher 
percentage of patients in the enzalutamide arm died within 30 days after discontinuation of study drug 
in comparison to placebo (4.0% vs 3.4%). 
Regarding the serious AEs, a higher percentage of patients in the enzalutamide group had serious AEs 
than in placebo group (32.0% vs 26.8%). Nevertheless, it seems that this higher percentage is due to 
events occurring after 1 year of treatment. Serious AEs reported in a higher frequency in the 
enzalutamide group included anaemia (1.6% enzalutamide vs 0.9% placebo), coronary artery disease 
(0.5% vs 0%), fatigue (0.5% vs 0%), femoral neck fracture (0.6% vs 0%), pathological fracture 
(1.1% vs 0.6%), cauda equina syndrome (0.5% vs 0%), syncope (0.7% vs 0%), and hypertension 
(0.5% vs 0%). 
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older patients and younger 
patients. 
Higher frequencies were observed in the enzalutamide arm compared to the placebo arm in study 
MDV3100-03 with regard to concomitant medication with anti-bacterials for systemic use (7.0% 
difference), anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products (5.6% difference), anti-anaemic 
preparations (5.2% difference), and analgesics (4.5% difference). The differences might be 
attributable to the considerably longer observation time in the enzalutamide arm.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of enzalutamide previously shown in the post-docetaxel setting seems to be 
quite similar to the one observed in the pre-docetaxel setting. Few additional adverse drug reactions 
have been included (restless legs syndrome, gynaecomastia and asthenia/fatigue) and some ADRs 
frequencies have changed likely due to the longer exposure in this setting (neutropenia, visual 
hallucinations, cognitive disorder, amnesia, hypertension, disturbance in attention).

2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Xtandi 40 mg soft capsules. The MAH has submitted a 
bridging report justifying that no major changes have been made to the leaflet as a consequence of the 
new indication. There were no significant differences in the content of the daughter leaflet (i.e. 2014) 
compared to the parent one (i.e. 2012). In addition the key messages as well as the writing style and 
layout are the same. The justification is considered acceptable and thus a separate User Test is not 
considered required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The administration of enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy setting resulted in a clinically meaningful 
and statistically significant benefit on both overall survival and rPFS (co-primary endpoints) as 
demonstrated by a 29% decrease in the risk of death for patients receiving enzalutamide compared 
with patients receiving placebo (HR 0.706 [95% CI: 0.596, 0.837]) and a 81% decrease in the risk of 
radiographic progression or death for patients receiving enzalutamide compared with patients receiving 
placebo (HR 0.186 [95% CI: 0.149, 0.231]). 
The updated analysis (cut-off January 2014; after four additional months and 116 additional deaths; 
58 in each group) confirmed the observations from the pre-specified interim analysis (HR 0.730 and 
HR 0.706 respectively). 
To ascertain that the benefit by enzalutamide on OS was not influenced by post-baseline therapies, an 
analysis on subsequent treatments were conducted. In the placebo arm 76 % subjects received any 
post-baseline anti-neoplastic treatment compared to 44 % in the enzalutamide arm. Thus, it may be 
concluded that the OS benefit observed is attributable to enzalutamide. 
Secondary endpoints also showed positive results for enzalutamide: Time to first skeletal-related event 
(HR 0.718 [95% CI: 0.610, 0.844]); Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (HR 0.349 [95% CI: 
0.303, 0.403]); Time to PSA progression (HR 0.169 [95% CI: 0.147, 0.195]); PSA response rate ≥ 
50% (between-group difference of 74.5% [95% CI: 71.45-77.57%]; Best overall soft tissue response 
(between-group difference of 53.9% [95% CI: 48.53-59.17%]). 
Results from the co-primary endpoints were robust, showing positive outcomes in all the sensitivity 
analyses and in the vast majority of subgroups. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The study was stopped after an interim analysis on OS, allowing placebo treated patients to receive 
enzalutamide treatment. This fact will impact on more mature OS data. In fact, some of the estimates 
commonly used when it comes to describing the effect (i.e. median) have not been reached yet. In 
addition, the medians of the OS for both groups of treatment seem quite similar, which very likely is 
due to the immature data. An update of investigator assessed rPFS together with an OS update will be 
submitted (see Annex II). 
The hazard ratio was less favourable for enzalutamide-treated patients who received sequential 
treatment with abiraterone (HR 1.23 [95% CI: (0.89, 1.68)]) and for enzalutamide-treated patients 
who received sequential treatment with docetaxel (HR 1.47 [95% CI: (1.17, 1.85)]). Notwithstanding 
the inherent bias associated to these analyses, a possible cross-resistance among treatments cannot

be totally ruled out. Results of ongoing studies may provide further evidence on the sequential use of 
abiraterone-enzalutamide. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously 
treated with abiraterone has been included as  missing information in the RMP and a study will collect 
data on the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in these patients. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the treatment with enzalutamide is well tolerated, since the dose reductions, interruptions and 
discontinuations were similar or slightly higher for enzalutamide arm versus the placebo arm. 
Despite the large difference in observation time, the crude frequencies of many AEs were often similar 
across arms or only slightly higher in the enzalutamide group of the pivotal study MDV3100-03. 
The incidence of AEs in the MDV3100-03 study was high in both groups. More than 90% of patients 
had some AEs. The most common adverse events associated with enzalutamide treatment in 
MDV3100-03 were fatigue (35.6%) and asthenia (13.0%), hot flush (18.0%), hypertension (13.9%), 
fall (11.6%), non-pathological fractures (7.8%), and mental impairment (5.7%). The previously 
identified important risk of seizure was observed in only 1 patient (0.1%) in each study arm of 
MDV3100-3. When the AEs reported were adjusted for length of exposure, hot flush, hypertension, fall, 
and dysgeusia, were higher for patients treated with enzalutamide than in the placebo group.  
Grade 3 or higher AEs occurring more frequently in the enzalutamide arm compared with placebo were 
cataract (1.3% vs 0.1%) nausea (1.0% vs 0.5%) general physical health deterioration (2.1% vs 1.2%) 
pneumonia (1.3% vs 0.8%) fall (1.4% vs 0.7%) spinal cord compression (3.8% vs 2.8%) syncope 
(1.6% vs 0.9%) and hypertension (6.8% vs 2.3%). However, only hypertension and cataract remained 
higher in the enzalutamide arm after adjusting for the longer safety reporting period.  
The AEs reported as primary reason for discontinuation appeared mostly related to the underlying 
disease or comorbidities related to the age group. The frequency of patients discontinuing due to AE 
was similar across arms in study MDV3100-3 (5.6% vs. 6.0% in enzalutamide and placebo arms, 
respectively), as well as in the combined controlled population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Enzalutamide has been associated with a potential for seizure in preclinical studies, a relationship with 
dose has been indicated in clinical studies, and a higher incidence compared with placebo was 
observed in the registration study CRPC2. However, the incidence of seizure was lower in MDV3100-03 
and no increase over placebo was observed. No explanation for the lower incidence of 
convulsions/seizure in the present MDV3100-3 compared with previous studies have been presented 
by the MAH. In the absence of other explanations, it is conceivable that this phenomenon could be due 
to a better identification of study participants at risk for seizure at screening. Seizure is adequately 
addressed in the RMP.The time-adjusted event rate for second malignancy was increased in the 
enzalutamide arm of MDV3100-3 compared to the placebo arm (3.3 vs. 1.8 events/ 100 PY). Given the 
relatively short time to onset, it is not likely that the observed cases represent a cancer-inducing effect 
of enzalutamide. Furthermore, there is no obvious mechanism for a theoretical cancer-promoting effect 
of enzalutamide. Based on these considerations, secondary malignancy will be closely monitored in 
PSURs and will be specifically addressed in the already planned updates from MDV3100-3 to the CHMP.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The treatment with enzalutamide has shown an increase in the life expectancy of mCRPC patients not 
yet candidates for docetaxel. This positive and robust finding is accompanied by a meaningful delay in 
the radiological progression of the disease. Along with these important findings, other clinical endpoints 
such as time to chemotherapy, time to skeletal event and PSA response, are supporting the main 
outcomes.  
Tolerability is of main importance in advanced cancer disease, and enzalutamide appears well-
tolerated, with limited additional toxicity compared with placebo, on top of the underlying castration 
therapy that is required in all CRPC patients. In addition, although this is mainly due to the efficacy of 
enzalutamide affecting disease related adverse events, the time to first grade 3 or more AE, as well as 
the time to first serious adverse event is considerably longer in enzalutamide-treated patients 
compared with placebo, which is considered of high value to patients. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of enzalutamide over placebo treatment of adult men with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation 
therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated, as shown in the pivotal study MDV3100-
03 is overall convincing and considered clinically meaningful.  
Enzalutamide on top of castration therapy in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer is considered well-tolerated. The benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Considering the benefits shown by enzalutamide in the population recruited in the pivotal trial and 
taking into account the positive results previously observed in the post-docetaxel setting, the use of 
enzalutamide in the proposed indication is supported by CHMP. The clinical value of the endpoints 
reached is clear. The efficacy results along with the observed safety profile and good tolerability 
support the use of enzalutamide in the proposed population. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to long-term efficacy: 
The MAH should submit updated results from the PREVAIL study and more specifically updated OS and 
investigator assessed rPFS data. The MAH should present the data based on the latest time point 
where investigator assessed rPFS data according to the study protocol is available and where data is 
not significantly affected by cross-over.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for nivolumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
28 serious cases of encephalitis were retrieved from various sources including spontaneous reports, 
literature reports and cases from clinical trials receiving either nivolumab monotherapy (19 cases) or 
combination therapy (9 cases) of whom 24 were assessed as related to nivolumab. Based on this 
outcome, update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of product characteristic to include 
encephalitis is recommended. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC Rapporteur considered that 
changes to the product information of medicinal products containing nivolumab were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nivolumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing nivolumab is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

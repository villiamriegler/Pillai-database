1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Applicant Celgene Europe BV submitted on 6 March 2019 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zeposia, through the centralised procedure falling within 
the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 18 May 2017  
The Applicant applied for the following indication: the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and  clinical  data  based  on  Applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/0345/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0345/2017  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. A PIP was agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) with a waiver for all 
subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 10 years of age. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the Applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a  condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The Applicant requested the active substance ozanimod hydrochloride contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the Applicant claims that it is not a constituent 
of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
The  Applicant  received  the  following  Scientific  Advice  on  the  development  relevant  for  the  indication 
subject to the present application:

The Scientific Advice (SA) pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
EMEA/H/SA/2779/1/2014/SME/III regarding quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects.  
•  Overall,  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  agreed  with  the  chemical, 
pharmaceutical  and  biological  development.  However,  CHMP  specifically  advised  to  propose  a 
different GMP starting material, discuss potential genotoxic impurities, further elaborate the single 
drug substance registration, a close follow of the ICHQ8 and Ph Eur recommendations. 
•  Overall,  CHMP  agreed  with  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  and  safety  development  plan  including 
immunotoxicity, carcinogenicity and peri/post-natal studies.  
•  Regarding clinical aspects, the study design of the pivotal studies was overall considered to follow 
the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011,  Rev.2).  Specifically,  the  overall  study  design,  primary  endpoint 
(annualized relapse rate (ARR)), choice of active control, and the intention to evaluate disability by 
pooling the data of both pivotal studies were generally agreed. CHMP noted that disability should be 
the most important of the secondary endpoints that confirmed disability progression after 6 months 
(CDP-6M) was considered more reliable than confirmed disability progression after 3 months (CDP-
3M).  In  this  regard,  CHMP  noted  that  12-month  duration  (used  in  Study  RPC01-301)  was  rather 
short in order to show an effect on disability. Statistical methods (including imputation of missing 
data) used for analysis of the pooled confirmed disability progression (CDP) data and methods of 
blinding  were  also  discussed.  In  the  context  of  broadness  of  indication,  it  was  advised,  that  the 
resulting data should allow also for evaluation of benefit risk in subjects with highly active disease. 
This issue was raised considering the intended population preferentially including low active patients 
and the potential effects of the molecule on the cardiac rhythm and conduction. CHMP recommended 
subgroup analysis (by region). Further topics of the SA concerned dose titration and the proposed 
cardiac  monitoring  for  which  CHMP  overall  agreed  with  the  Applicant’s  position  and  the  safety 
database for which some uncertainties were raised in relation to long-term safety outcomes.   
EMEA/H/SA/2779/1/FU/1/2017/I centralized follow-up advice was provided on quality issues including 
stability data and dissolution method.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  is  a  chronic  immune-mediated  and  neurodegenerative  disease  of  the  central 
nervous  system  (CNS)  characterized  by  inflammation,  demyelination,  neuro-axonal  injury  leading  to 
irreversible deficits in physical and cognitive functions that impair quality of life. 
Clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have utilized measures to assess the impact of MS 
on physical and cognitive disability. Classically used outcome measures in Phase 3 MS trials are the ARR, 
the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), number or volume of hyperintense T2-weighted lesions and 
gadolinium-enhancing  (GdE)  T1  lesions  shown  by  brain  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI).  Newer, 
potentially valuable outcome measures capture disease aspects that are insufficiently captured by the 
more traditional outcome measures have been increasingly used or explored in MS trials and include the 
MS  Functional  Composite  (MSFC)  score,  MS  Quality  of  Life-54  questionnaire  (MSQOL-54),  and  brain 
volume changes to assess earlier factors that may impaired quality of life. Specifically, tracking brain 
volume changes is an appealing approach as brain volume loss starts early in the disease course and 
continues throughout the patient’s lifetime. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The prevalence of MS is increasing and is currently estimated to affect 2.3 million individuals worldwide 
(Multiple Sclerosis International Foundation, 2013). In Europe, the median prevalence is 100 cases per 
100,000 and the highest prevalence of MS occurs in countries with high latitude, including Sweden (188.9 
per 100,000), Norway (203 per 100,000), and Denmark (232 per 100,000). The incidence of MS appears 
to increase. 
The onset of MS typically occurs between the ages of 20 and 40 and predominantly affects women (2 to 
3 times more frequently than men). In young and middle-aged adults, MS represents the leading cause 
of non-traumatic neurologic disability. People living with MS experience physical disability, fatigue, and 
cognitive impairment, which often happens early in the disease course, markedly reducing quality of life 
and ability to work or study. This may contribute to an increasing socio-economic burden on patients 
and their families. 
Reduction  of  inflammatory  burden  (relapses  and  inflammatory  CNS  lesions)  is  the  primary  focus  of 
therapy as inflammation leads to neurodegeneration in MS. There is no known strategy to prevent MS 
in the general population. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact aetiology of MS remains unknown, it is generally assumed that MS is mediated by an 
immune-mediated inflammatory process that is triggered by environmental factors superimposed on a 
genetic predisposition. The major contributors to this process are T and B lymphocytes from the adaptive 
immune system and macrophages and microglia from the innate immune system. From the peripheral 
immune system, autoreactive T-helper cells are primed and stimulated to infiltrate the CNS where they 
target  myelin  antigens.  Inflammation  of  the  white  and  grey  matter  tissues  in  the  CNS  due  to  focal 
immune cell infiltration and release of cytokines are the incipient cause of tissue damage in MS not only 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 12/188 
 
 
 
to the myelin sheath but also to the underlying axons. This process happens over time and results in 
repeated attacks (clinically eloquent or not). During the acute phase, clinical signs and symptoms may 
rise  due  to  demyelination  and  inflammation  that  impairs  or  interrupts  nerve  conduction.  Afterwards, 
remaining permanent symptoms (sequelae) are due to neuro-axonal injury. Elements from both adaptive 
and innate immune systems are involved in any stage of MS although the contribution and the patterns 
of inflammation may change across phenotypes and individuals. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, representing approximately 85% of 
patients  at  diagnosis.  The  course  of  RRMS  is  unpredictable,  with  variable  periods  of  disease  activity 
interspersed with periods of stability. According to earlier natural history studies, approximately 50% of 
patients  with  RRMS  will,  within  the  first  20  years  after  diagnosis,  develop  secondary  progressive  MS 
(SPMS),  which  is  characterized  by  worsening  disability  independently  of  the  presence  or  absence  of 
relapses. Recent findings from cohorts of patients mostly treated with DMTs from early onset have found 
lower transition rates to SPMS. Additionally, primary progressive MS is the presenting form at diagnosis 
in approximately 15% of MS patients and is characterized by chronic worsening of disability early in the 
disease  and  in  the  absence  of  relapses.  In  MS,  transitory  disability  in  the  acute  phase  of  a  relapse 
represents  clinical  dysfunction  due  to  a  focal  inflammatory  lesion  and  subsequent  myelin  loss  that 
impaired nerve conduction. After the acute phase, permanent disability as clinical sequalae represents 
irreversible neuro-axonal injury due to focal inflammation. In MS, progression in neuronal disability is 
due to accumulation of neuro-axonal injury either due to focal inflammation or due to diffuse chronic 
neuroinflammation.  
Typical symptoms include numbness and weakness in the legs leading to difficulty walking, vision loss, 
incoordination,  cognitive  dysfunction,  fatigue  and  pain.  These  lesion-driven  symptoms  are  also 
associated  with  considerable  anxiety  and  distress  for  patients.  In  addition  to  the  major  physical, 
psychological, and social impacts to patients and their families, MS carries a significant financial burden 
for patients, their families, and institutions responsible for health care. The diagnosis of RRMS can be 
made  on  clinical  basis  alone,  but  MRI,  cerebrospinal  fluid,  and/or  electrophysiological  findings  can 
support,  supplement,  or  even  replace  some  of  the  clinical  diagnostic  criteria  for  MS.  Given  the 
complexities of diagnosing MS, the McDonald diagnostic criteria have been developed and continue to 
be revised to facilitate earlier diagnosis and initiation of treatment. These criteria have been used for 
nearly two decades and most recently updated in 2017. The McDonald diagnostic criteria are comprised 
of clinical observation, neurologic examination, brain and spinal cord MRI scans and cerebrospinal fluid 
examination.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There  is  no  cure  available  for  MS.  Therapies  for  MS  include  treatment  for  relapses  (e.g.  steroids), 
symptomatic treatments (e.g. drugs for stabilization of nerve conduction or dealing with pain) and those 
that alter the course of the disease (DMTs).  
The goal of treating RRMS with DMTs is to modify the natural course of disease by reducing the rate of 
relapses  and  MRI  focal  inflammatory  activity  to  delay  disability  worsening.  The  inability  of  transected 
axons to be repaired and the limited ability to remyelinate demyelinated segments supports the need of 
an  early  intervention  to  preserve  CNS  early  in  the  disease  course.  Consequently,  optimization  of 
outcomes  using  an  early  intervention  with  highly  effective  DMTs  is  increasingly  recognized  as  an 
important  treatment  strategy  to  reduce  both  long-term  physical  and  cognitive  disability,  thereby 
improving the patient’s overall quality of life.

There  are  several  DMTs  available  for  the  treatment  of  MS  with  different  mechanisms  of  action  and 
differentiated efficacy and safety profiles. These include (1) the first-approved DMTs (IFN β-1a, IFN β-
1b, glatiramer acetate), (2) oral therapies (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, cladribine and 
siponimod), and (3) monoclonal antibodies (alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, and natalizumab; daclizumab 
has been withdrawn early last year due to serious adverse events (SAE) and death). 
The  earliest  approved  injectable  DMTs  (IFN  β-1a,  IFN  β-1b,  and  glatiramer  acetate)  have  a  well 
characterized  efficacy  and  safety  profile  leading  to  their  widespread  use.  The  safety  profile  for  the 
interferons  includes  depression  and  risk  of  suicide,  hepatic  injury,  decreased  peripheral  blood  count, 
anaphylaxis,  and  injection-site  reactions.  For  glatiramer  acetate,  safety  concerns  include  immediate 
post-injection  reactions/necrosis  and  transient  chest  pain.  Tolerability  issues  such  as  injection  site 
reactions and/or flu-like symptoms for the interferons and lipoatrophy with GA may impact adherence 
with these agents. In the real-world setting, based on patient claims data in 2016, approximately two-
thirds of subjects discontinued treatment with interferons after twelve months of therapy (Symphony 
Claims data, Celgene analysis on file, 2019). 
The  first  approved  oral  nonselective sphingosine  1-phosphate  receptor  (S1P)  receptor  modulator  was 
indicated for RRMS patients with highly active disease despite a previous DMT or for rapidly evolving, 
severe disease. The safety profile includes cardiac effects at initiation of treatment (bradyarrhythmia and 
atrioventricular  [AV]  block)  and  QT  prolongation,  infections  including  herpes  and  cryptococcus, 
progressive  multifocal  encephalopathy  (PML),  macular  oedema,  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy 
syndrome  (PRES),  respiratory  effects,  increased  liver  enzymes  and  blood  pressure,  risk  of  significant 
disability  after  stopping  in  the  post  marketing  setting  (rebound),  cutaneous  malignancies,  and 
lymphoma. More recently, the first oral selective S1P receptor modulator has been approved for SPMS 
with active disease.  
Dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide are more recently approved oral agents that have demonstrated 
moderate  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  RRMS.  The  safety  profile  of  dimethyl  fumarate  includes 
anaphylaxis,  PML,  lymphopenia,  liver  injury,  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  (AEs),  and  flushing.  The 
safety profile for teriflunomide includes hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy, 
increased  blood  pressure,  interstitial  lung  disease,  hypersensitivity  and  serious  skin  reactions  and 
teratogenicity. 
The most recently approved oral therapy, cladribine, is a highly effective oral agent indicated for RRMS 
patients with highly active disease. The safety profile includes prolonged lymphocyte count reduction, 
infections such as herpes, and potential reactivation of tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B, malignancy 
and a requirement for contraception in women of childbearing potential and in men. 
Natalizumab was the first monoclonal antibody DMT approved for highly active RRMS, is administered 
as an intravenous infusion. The safety profile includes PML, herpes encephalitis, meningitis and acute 
retinal  necrosis,  hepatotoxicity,  and  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions.  More  recent  monoclonal 
antibodies include alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Alemtuzumab is a highly effective monoclonal therapy 
originally indicated for RRMS patients with active disease that is administered IV separated by 12 months, 
with safety follow up for 48 months after the last infusion. The safety profile of alemtuzumab includes 
infusion-related  reactions,  infections,  autoimmune  disorders  including  immune  thrombocytopenia, 
nephropathies and thyroid disorders requiring frequent laboratory monitoring, stroke and increased risk 
of  malignancy  including  melanoma  requiring  yearly  skin  exams.  Following  new  reports  of  immune-
mediated conditions and cardiac/vascular problems, a review of Lemtrada was initiated on 10 April 2019 
at the request of EC, under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. On 16 January 2020, EC issued 
a final legally binding decision to restrict the use of Lemtrada to adults with RRMS that is highly active 
despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease-modifying therapy or rapidly 
evolving severe disease defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more GdE

lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load compared to a recent MRI. Ocrelizumab, 
another highly effective monoclonal DMT administered IV, is also indicated for RRMS patients with active 
disease,  as  well  as  early  primary  progressive  MS.  The  safety  profile  of  ocrelizumab  includes  infusion-
related reactions and infections including PML, herpes and hepatitis B reactivation; an increased risk for 
malignancies, including breast cancer, may exist.  
With  the  availability  of  multiple  treatment  modalities,  clinicians  can  choose  from  several  medications 
with  differing  mechanisms  of  action,  risk  profiles,  and  monitoring  requirements.  The  greater  array  of 
treatment  options  available  enables  clinicians  to  individualize  treatment  taking  patient  preferences, 
monitoring recommendations, drug- and individual-specific risk factors, and concerns regarding the long-
term risk of MS-related disability and morbidity into consideration. 
Despite  the  availability  of  several  medications  for  the  treatment  of  MS,  there  remains  a  need  for  an 
effective  oral  agent  with  a  favourable  benefit,  safety  and  tolerability  profiles.  Ozanimod  may  offer  an 
alternative of an effective therapy with acceptable safety and tolerability profile and a dose escalation 
regimen that does not require first dose observation. 
2.2.  About the product 
Ozanimod hydrochloride  (HCl)  (also  known  as  RPC1063)  is  a  potent,  orally  bioavailable,  S1P  agonist, 
which binds with high affinity and selectively to S1P subtypes 1 (S1P1) and 5 (S1P5). Agonist activation 
of S1P1 induces down-modulation of cell surface S1P1 expression which results in lymphocyte retention 
in lymphoid tissues and therefore, peripheral lymphocyte counts are decreased in the circulation that is 
thought to ameliorate the pathological processes (focal inflammatory activity) associated with MS.  
Ozanimod is being developed for the clinical treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). 
The proposed maximum human recommended dose (MHRD) for the treatment of this condition is one 
milligram (1 mg) ozanimod HCl per day.

2.3.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  active  substance  ozanimod  hydrochloride  (HCl)  is  not  described  in  the  European  Pharmacopoeia, 
pharmacopoeias of the EU member states or USP. No ASMF has been submitted. Full information on the 
active substance has been provided in the dossier. 
The chemical name of ozanimod hydrochloride is 5-(3-{(1S)-1-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2,3-dihydro-
1H-inden-4-yl}-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-[(propan-2-yl)oxy]benzonitrile, monohydrochloride, 
corresponding to the molecular formula C23H24N4O3•HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 440.92 
g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The structure of ozanimod HCl was inferred by the synthetic route and confirmed by Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 13C 
NMR),  UV  spectroscopy,  mass  spectrometry,  and  elemental  analysis.  The  chiral  integrity  of  the 
downstream intermediates is confirmed by chiral HPLC. The solid-state properties were investigated by 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).  
Ozanimod is a slightly hygroscopic white to off-white solid, with a logP of 3.28 and a pKa of 7.90. Its 
solubility in water depends on the pH. It has a melting point (by DSC) with an onset at 240 ºC.  
Ozanimod exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The (S) configuration was 
confirmed  for  both  RP101122  intermediate  and  the  active  substance  by  X-ray  crystal  structure 
determination.  Enantiomeric  purity  is  tested  at  release  and  during  stability  studies  by  chiral  HPLC 
analysis.  
A polymorph screening was conducted on ozanimod hydrochloride through competitive slurring studies 
Four forms were observed. Form 1 was the form selected for commercial use since it was found to be 
the most stable crystalline form. In addition, samples of ozanimod HCl from the stability program were 
characterized by XRPD. The XRPD of all samples are consistent with Form 1 and provided further evidence 
of the stability of Form 1 with no conversions to any other form in the solid state. Based on the stability 
data provided, it can be concluded that ozanimod HCl manufactured at the proposed manufacturing sites 
does  not  convert  to  another  form  even  after  60  months  at  25°C  and  60%  RH  or  6  months  under 
accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH). 
The applicant claims that ozanimod is not authorized in the European Union (EU), and furthermore it is 
not  a  salt,  complex,  or  isomer  or  mixture  of  isomers,  or  a  derivative  of  an  authorized  substance  and 
therefore it is a new active substance (NAS). To support his claim the applicant indicated that ozanimod 
activity is exerted by the ozanimod active substance and several active metabolites. It is stated that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 16/188 
 
 
 
 
 
two major metabolites of ozanimod are CC9112273, and CC108403. Results from searches in various 
databases to support the NAS claim were presented.  
it was concluded that ozanimod is not a salt, complex, or isomer or mixture of isomers, or a derivative 
of an authorized substance. Furthermore, ozanimod does not expose the patient to the same therapeutic 
moiety as any previously authorized active substance, and therefore it is concluded that it is a new active 
substance (NAS). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ozanimod  HCl  is  synthesized  in  three  main  stages  using  commercially  available  well  defined  starting 
materials  with  acceptable  specifications,  one  of  them  redefined  during  the  marketing  authorization 
application  evaluation  as  requested  by  the  CHMP.  Relevant  information  on  manufacturers,  synthetic 
routes, specifications and impurity profiles has been included. An updated version of the CTD relevant 
sections  regarding  starting  materials  has  been  adequately  presented  resolving  the  previously  raised 
major objection. 
All holding times for intermediates have been supported by stability data. 
A flow diagram and an adequately detailed narrative description of the manufacturing process, including 
criteria  for  all  process  parameters  and  IPCs,  has  been  provided.  Relevant  process  parameters  and 
amounts  of  materials,  reagents  and  solvents  have  been  included  in  the  process  description  with  set 
points or ranges. 
The introduction of the chiral centre was thoroughly discussed and evaluated. Adequate specifications 
have  been  set  for  isolated  intermediates,  starting  materials  and  reagents.  Experiments,  including 
impurity  fate  and  purge  studies,  have  been  adequately  performed  in  order to gain  additional  process 
knowledge and understanding, as well as to justify the suitability of the control for starting materials, 
intermediates and the active substance. In general, the proposed methods used to control the starting 
materials and isolated intermediates have been properly described and validated in line with relevant 
ICH  guidelines.  Batch  analyses  have  been  provided  for  representative  batches  of  starting  materials 
confirming compliance with the proposed specifications.  
Reprocessing  has  been  adequately  justified.  The  IPCs  used  to  monitor  and  assess  the  process 
performance, the quality of the intermediates, and of the active substance are listed and are found to 
be adequate. Critical steps and the respective controls are identified.  
A  combination  of  one  factor  at  a  time  (OFAT)  experiments  and  multifactor  statistical  Design  of 
Experiments (DoE) were used to understand and set proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for the studied 
parameters.  Pilot  and  production  scale  batches  along  with  scientific  judgment  regarding  common 
variability were also used to establish PARs  for process parameters of lower risk and/or less complex 
operations/factors. The established PARs combined with the critical process parameters CPPs described, 
the IPCs, and the control of materials comprise the overall control strategy. 
A control strategy for critical quality attributes (CQAs) which resulted in the proposed specifications, was 
developed  as  the  output  of  the  quality  risk  management  process.  PARs  established  were  adequately 
justified and ensure that the active substance produced complied with all required CQAs.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin. The applicant has 
presented an impurity discussion addressing all impurities possible from the starting materials, raw 
materials and subsequent synthesis. Hypothesized process impurities are also discussed. The starting 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 17/188 
 
 
 
materials and raw materials are controlled by material specification. Process intermediates are 
controlled by material specification, IPC testing, and process design. Specified impurities are controlled 
in compliance to the ICH Q3A guideline. The impurity at a level greater than 0.15% has been suitably 
qualified. 
The discussion on potential genotoxic impurities is adequate. Specified impurities and other structures 
hypothesized to have the potential for mutagenic concern, were evaluated in silico for potential 
mutagenicity using both rule-based and statistical-based tools in accordance with the ICH M7 Step 4 
Guideline. All impurities were assigned into Control Class 5.  
No significant changes to the manufacturing route were made during development. Any modifications 
were made to improve process efficiency but used the same reagents and yielded active substance 
with similar impurity profiles and no significant new impurities. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bags. The bags are zip-tied and placed into 
tightly sealed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drums. The container closure components comply with 
the EC directive 10/2011 and the Ph. Eur. monograph for polyethylene. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  release  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (FT-IR,  HPLC), 
solid form (XRPD), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), free chloride (titration), particle size (Ph. 
Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
The specification provides the necessary controls to ensure the suitability of the active substance for its 
intended use.  
Specifications  are  well  justified in  view  of  current  guidelines.  Justification  has  been  provided  for  each 
parameter.  
Information on potential elemental impurities and the risk assessment performed in line with ICH Q3D 
Option  1  and  assuming  a  maximum  of  10g/day  of  active  substance  intake  has  been  provided  and 
considered  satisfactory.  Representative  active  substance  batches  were  tested  for  relevant  elemental 
impurities Levels were well below the 30% control threshold recommended in the ICH Q3D guideline so 
it  is  acceptable  that  elemental  impurities  are  not  directly  controlled  in  the  active  substance  release 
specification although a general residue on ignition test is included. 
As  indicated  earlier,  Form  1  is  the  only  stable  crystalline  polymorph  identified  and  studies  conducted 
during development confirmed Form 1 on stability samples. Therefore, solid form will only be tested at 
release  for  the  commercial  active  substance.  Chiral  purity  data  collected  for  release  and  stability 
demonstrates that ozanimod HCl remains in the (S)-isomer configuration. No racemization occurs over 
time and therefore the test is not required for stability testing. 
The  justification  provided  for  the  absence  of  water  content  control  at  stability,  based  on  the  non-
hygroscopic nature and no changes in water content during stability is acceptable.  
The  proposed  analytical  procedures  for  identity,  assay,  related  substances,  chiral  purity  and  residual 
solvents have been properly described and (non-compendial methods) validated in accordance with the 
ICH  guidelines.  The  results  from  the  validation  studies  showed  the  methods  were  suitable  for  their 
intended  use.  The  stability  indicating  nature  of  the  HPLC  test  method  for  determination  of  assay  and 
related  substances  has  been  demonstrated  by  results  of  forced  degradation  studies.  All  compendial 
analytical  procedures  have  been  verified  and  shown  to  be  suitable  for  testing  ozanimod  HCl  active 
substance.  
Assessment report

Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used  for  assay  and  impurities  testing  has 
been presented. 
Batch data from 28 pilot to production scale batches have been provided. These included three stability 
batches as well as batches used during clinical development. All results were within the proposed limits 
and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from six pilot scale registration batches of active substance stored in a container closure 
system  that  simulates  the  commercial  packaging  configuration  for  up  to  24  months  under  long  term 
conditions  (25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Supportive long term and accelerated stability data from representative active substance batches used 
for clinical development purposes or process validation, was also provided. Long term data is available 
for up to 60 months.  
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  polymorphic  form,  chiral  purity,  assay,  related 
substances and water content. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability 
indicating. In addition, chiral purity was monitored over time. 
No changes or trends indicating degradation were observed for all samples under either long-term or 
accelerated  conditions  for  the  appearance,  assay,  water  content,  related  substances  or  chiral  purity 
parameters  when  the  batches  were  stored  in  the  proposed  commercial  packaging  material.  The 
polymorphic form remains unchanged over time and no racemization of the chiral centre occurs. 
Forced degradation studies were performed on the active substance under acidic, basic, oxidative, and 
thermal stress conditions and the results obtained indicate that the HPLC method used for identification, 
assay and related substances is stability indicating.  
Photostability studies were performed on active substance batches in line with ICH Q1B Option 2. The 
results obtained indicate that the active substance is not photosensitive. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier(s)  is 
sufficiently stable. Based on these results, the re-test period for active substance stored in the container 
proposed for marketing with the storage condition has been accepted 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and, except the hard gelatin capsule shell and 
associated black inks, comply with compendial requirements. The composition and specification of the 
non-compendial  excipients  are  presented  and it is  confirmed  that  the ingredients  are  pharmacopoeial 
grade or at least of foodstuff grade (colorants).  
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The capsules are packaged into a polyvinylchloride/polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PVC/PCTFE) blister. The 
blister consists of a rigid PVC layer laminated to a PCTFE layer and is heat-sealed with a push through 
foil. Its components comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
The  pharmaceutical  development  has  been  properly  described  through  a  minimal  approach  (without 
applying Quality by Design) but applying quality risk management concepts as per ICH Q8 (R2) and Q9 
guidelines.  
Batches  of  active  substance  with  a  range  of  particle  size  distributions  were included in  a  multivariate 
study to evaluate the impact of particle size distribution on the dissolution behaviour of ozanimod HCl in 
the finished product.  
During early development, a study to evaluate the compatibility of ozanimod HCl with potential excipients 
was  performed.  In  this  study,  common  solid  dosage  form  excipients  were  combined  with  the  active 
substance, either individually or in binary excipient mixtures. After storage the active substance itself, 
and the active substance/excipient mixtures were evaluated. All of the excipients utilized in the study 
were considered compatible with the active substance. The excipients selected for the finished product 
formulation are commonly used in direct blend capsule formulations and are utilized at levels common 
for their function in an immediate release product.  
Risk  assessment  was  used  throughout  the  pharmaceutical  development  to  identify  risks  in  active 
substance,  excipients  and  manufacturing  process  and  to  determine  which  studies  were  necessary  to 
improve  product  and  process  understanding  to  develop  a  suitable  control  strategy  for  the  finished 
product.  
The  dissolution  method  for  ozanimod  HCl  capsules  was  developed  through  a  course  of  experiments 
designed to identify conditions with sufficient discriminatory power.  
The process development work to support Ozanimod HCl capsules has been performed Collectively, the 
data obtained and demonstrates robustness of the proposed commercial process. 
The formulation and manufacturing development studies were adequately described.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  was  adequately  described  by  the  applicant.  Ozanimod  HCl  capsules  are 
manufactured using a conventional direct dry blending process followed by encapsulation, packaging and 
labelling. The process does not involve any compression of the blend during manufacturing. The process 
is a non-standard manufacturing process due to the low active substance content in the finished product 
(<0.3%). 
Ranges for each process parameter are based on the data from process robustness studies. Bulk hold 
storage  times  have  been  established  for  final  blend  and  bulk  capsules.  These  were  justified  by 
appropriate stability studies and are considered acceptable.

The  commercial  manufacturing  process  for  the  0.23  mg,  0.46  mg  and  0.92  mg  strengths  has  been 
adequately  validated  The  validation  consisted  of  three  batches  of  each  dosage  strength  utilizing  the 
proposed  commercial  process  and  scale  using active  substance  provided  by the  proposed  commercial 
active substance supplier(s).  
Although the development data indicate that the manufacturing process is well controlled, the capsule 
weight, as proposed by the applicant, was considered insufficient to ensure the uniformity of the dosage 
units,  due  to  the  low  active  substance  content  in  the  drug  product  (<0.3%).  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
requested the addition of a content uniformity test as an IPC.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The limits for impurities are within the qualification threshold recommended by ICH Q3B. The impurities 
present  in  the  finished  product  are  the  same  as  those  in  the  active  substance.  There  are  no  new 
degradation products specific for the finished product.  
Ozanimod HCl is a highly soluble active substance and the finished product was designed to be immediate 
release. Based on the reported results of clinical batches tightening of the dissolution limit following the 
principles described in the CHMP “Reflection paper on the dissolution specification for generic solid oral 
immediate release products with systemic action” (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017) was requested 
during  the  MA  review.  The  release  and  stability  data  collected  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product 
formulation, manufacturing process, and stability do not have an impact on the chiral purity of the active 
ingredient. Therefore, chiral purity testing is not included in the finished product specification. 
A risk assessment in line with ICH Q3D was conducted for ozanimod HCl capsules to identify potential 
elemental  impurities  that  may  be  present  in  the  finished  product.  The  potential  sources  of  elemental 
impurities  in  finished  drug  product  are  the  manufacturing  equipment  and  process,  chemicals/utilities 
used  in  the  process,  the  active  substance  and  excipients,  and  the  container-closure  systems  for  both 
active substance and finished product. The assessment was performed for Class 1 (Hg, Cd, Pb, and As) 
and Class 2A (Ni, Co, and V) elements as recommended for oral dosage forms. Batches were tested for 
these  elements  and  the  results  revealed  that  none  of  these  elements  were  detected  in  the  finished 
product apart from one which is a component of the active substance manufacturing equipment. The 
amount of this element present was well below 30% of the PDE recommended in the ICH Q3D guideline. 
In conclusion, no controls for elemental impurities in the finished product are required.  
In view of recent nitrosamine discussions and considering ozanimod is a chemically synthesised active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, an evaluation of the risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities in both active 
substance and finished product was provided. No obvious risk factors for the generation or presence of 
nitrosamine impurities during the manufacturing process were identified. It was noted that nitrocellulose 
may  be  present  in  print  primer  in  the  aluminum  push-through  foils  used  for  primary  packaging,  and 
amines may be present in the printing ink. From the overall risk assessment performed, it is concluded 
that there isn’t a significant risk of nitrosamine contamination of Zeposia from the packaging materials.  
However, given that nitrosamine formation between the amines in the active substance or printing ink 
and the nitrocellulose in the primer of aluminium push-through foil has been identified as a possible root 
cause for nitrosamine formation, even when the nitrocellulose is not in direct contact with the tablet or 
capsule (ref. EMA/CHMP/428592/2019 Rev. 2), the applicant is recommended to further evaluate this

potential root cause of nitrosamines and update his risk assessment accordingly as per the EMA note 
EMA/189634/2019”. 
Non-compendial analytical procedures are described in detail. The non-compendial analytical procedures 
have been adequately validated in accordance with the requirements of ICH Q2 guideline: Validation of 
Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology which demonstrates their suitability for their intended use. 
The stability indicating nature of the HPLC method used for assay and degradation products has been 
demonstrated by means of forced degradation studies (thermal, thermal-humidity, oxidation, acid, base 
and photostability). Suitability of the microbial limit test for analysis of the finished product was provided. 
The  main  reference  standard  used  for  testing  the  finished  product  is  the  ozanimod  HCl  reference 
standard. Other impurity reference standards are also used for testing the finished product. Satisfactory 
information regarding theses reference standards has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  for  multiple  commercial  scale  batches  from  commercial  manufacturing  sites  as 
well  as  pilot  and  commercial  scale  batches  from  development  sites  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification have been 
provided.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  at  least  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished  product  of  each  strength 
manufactured at each of the commercial sites stored for up to 36 months under long term (25ºC / 60% 
RH) conditions, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. Additional stability data from one 0.23 mg batch from each manufacturer 
stored  at  intermediate  conditions  (30°C  /  65%  RH)  was  also  submitted.  The  batches  of  Zeposia  are 
identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  
Supportive  stability  data  from  batches  manufactured  at  other  sites  during  development  stored  under 
long term and accelerated conditions were also presented. These studies represent the formulations and 
packaging configurations utilized in the clinical studies. 
Samples were tested for appearance, chiral purity, assay, related substances, dissolution, water content, 
and microbial limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
No significant changes in the appearance of the finished product were noted under any of the conditions 
tested.  
Assay  values  remained  within  the  proposed  acceptance  criterion  for  all  long  term,  intermediate  and 
accelerated stability samples for the 0.46 mg and 0.92 mg strengths. However, out of specification (OOS) 
results were seen for a few batches of the 0.23 mg strength under accelerated conditions. Therefore, 
testing under intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% RH) was initiated for this strength and data up to 36 
months have been provided. An out of specification assay result was observed for one batch after 24 
months. However, all long-term results were within the specification. This justifies the proposed storage 
condition: “do not store above 25°C”. 
For the remaining tested parameters, the stability results comply with the proposed specifications for all 
three strengths under all conditions tested although some trends were observed. 
A correlation between water content and product degradation, particularly at the low strength of 0.23 
mg, was observed. Based on this correlation and the fact that the resultant degradation products are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 22/188 
 
 
 
monitored  by  a  more  sensitive  HPLC  technique,  water  content  will  not  be  performed  on  stability  for 
commercial product.  
Chiral purity values remained consistent during development and primary stability studies. Furthermore, 
the finished product formulation, manufacturing process, and storage condition do not have an impact 
on the chiral purity of the active ingredient. As a result, chiral purity testing will not be performed on the 
commercial product as discussed in the specification section. 
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are acceptable. 
Photostability  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q1B.  The  photostability  study  results 
revealed absence of significant changes for all samples exposed to light. Thus, the finished product is 
considered photostable. Forced degradation studies were performed in the context of validation of the 
HPLC  method  used  for  assay  and  degradation  products  which,  as  a  result,  is  considered  stability 
indicating. The results obtained indicate that the ozanimod HCl capsules are sensitive to most conditions 
tested, in particular oxidative conditions. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  36  months  and  storage  condition  “Do  not 
store above 25°C” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) for all the three strengths is acceptable.  
The start of shelf-life is set in accordance with CPMP/QWP/072/96 in that shelf-life begins with the date 
that the active ingredient is combined with other ingredients.  
Adventitious agents 
Valid  TSE  certificates  of  suitability  for  the  gelatin  used  in  the  hard  capsules  have  been  provided. 
Magnesium stearate is derived from vegetable sources. No other excipients of human or animal origin 
are employed to manufacture ozanimod HCl capsules. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The major objection raised during the evaluation requesting 
the redefinition of the proposed starting material used for active substance synthesis was resolved. The 
applicant  redefined  it  further  back  in  the  synthesis  and  provided  further  data.  All  other  remaining 
concerns, including the risk assessment for the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities were also 
satisfactorily addressed. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Assessment report

The applicant is recommended to further evaluate the potential formation of nitrosamines as a result of 
the use of nitrocellulose printing primer in the blister pack and to provide the result of an updated risk 
evaluation as per the EMA note EMA/189634/2019. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Prior to the submission, the Applicant received SA (EMEA/H/SA/2779/1/2014/SME/III) and CHMP overall 
agreed  with  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  and  safety  development  plan  including  immunotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity and peri/post-natal studies. 
The pivotal safety pharmacological core battery investigations on cardiovascular and respiratory function 
and all toxicology studies, except those with dose-range finding purpose, were conducted in compliance 
with GLP regulations. 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision EMEA 
P/0345/2017 on the agreement of a PIP. As part of the PIP, the two nonclinical studies included in the 
PIP, a 10-week juvenile rat toxicity study (study 2) and a 33-Day oral immunotoxicity study in juvenile 
rats (study 5), were completed and found to have been conducted in accordance with the PIP. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Ozanimod hydrochloride  (HCl)  (also  known  as  RPC1063)  is  a  potent,  orally  bioavailable,  S1P  agonist, 
which binds with high affinity and selectively to S1P1 and S1P5 (S1P1 and S1P5) that demonstrated high 
affinity and selectivity for S1P1 and S1P5 receptors in various reporter, binding or activity assays using 
recombinant murine, rat, Cynomolgus monkey or human S1P receptor subtypes. The EC50 of ozanimod 
was  1.03 ± 0.16nM  at  human  S1P1  and  about  10-fold  lower  at  S1P5  receptors  (10.66 ± 0.29nM). 
Ozanimod showed no relevant interaction with S1P2, S1P3 and S1P4 subtypes. 
Ozanimod  represents  the  main  pharmacologically  active  component  in  animals,  whereas  two  major 
metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 predominate and persist in humans at significantly higher levels 
than in rodents and monkeys (>10% of human plasma Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)). 
In contrast, the third main metabolite RP101124 did not unveil relevant pharmacological activity at any 
S1P  receptor  subtype,  while  all  other  major  and  minor  metabolites  generally  share  the  affinity  and 
selectivity  profile  at  S1P  receptors  with  ozanimod.  In  particular,  the  EC50  values  of  CC112273  and 
CC1084037 at human, murine, rat and monkey S1P1 receptors were similar to ozanimod. In contrast, 
CC112273  showed  3-fold  lower  interaction  with  the  human  S1P5  subtype  than  ozanimod,  while 
CC1084037  revealed  3-fold  higher  affinity  compared  to  its  parent  compound.  Both  major  active 
metabolites  showed  3-  to  6-fold  higher  affinity  for  murine,  rat  and  monkey  S1P5  receptors  than 
ozanimod.  
Prolonged S1P1 interaction promoted internalisation and degradation of the receptors leading to a down-
modulation  of  the  signalling  response.  This  modulation  resulted  in  lymphocyte  retention  in  lymphoid 
tissues and is thought to ameliorate the pathological processes associated with MS. S1P1 expression in 
astrocytes may contribute to the severity of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 
an  animal  model  of  human  MS.  However,  the  activity  at  S1P5  receptors  must  be  different,  because 
neither  ozanimod,  nor  the  non-selective  S1P  receptor  agonist  fingolimod  triggered  a  similar  down-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 24/188 
 
 
 
modulation up to the highest test concentration of 1 µM. S1P5 is expressed on oligodendrocytes in the 
CNS and at all stages of their maturation. The myelination potential of these cells has been proposed to 
be modulated by S1P5. 
In  the  murine  EAE  model,  efficacy  for  orally  administered  ozanimod  or  its  active  major  and  minor 
metabolites  CC112273,  RP101075,  RP101988  and  RP101442  was  demonstrated  as  a  general  dose-
dependent reduction of EAE disease scores. The amelioration of EAE symptoms was typically associated 
with decreased numbers of circulating lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and mature B-cells), which 
could hence serve as surrogate parameter to define the pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) 
relationship  of  ozanimod  and  its  active  metabolites  in  healthy  mice,  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  As  all 
primary  active  metabolites  are  further  converted  into  other  active  downstream  compounds,  the 
magnitude and duration of the lymphocyte reductions over time could be correlated with the total active 
drug concentration, which was estimated to amount to trough levels of ~2.7-6.1nM in both animals and 
humans at 24 h post dosing. 
In a mouse model of demyelination induced by cuprizone and rapamycin, orally administered ozanimod 
had significantly attenuated the apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes as indicated by lower myelin loss 
during the acute 6 weeks demyelination challenge but did not improve spontaneous remyelination by 
oligodendrocyte precursors in the hippocampus, cortex or the corpus callosum when dosed continuously 
over 12 weeks post-demyelinating challenge, although sustained reductions of peripheral lymphocytes 
were still evident. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The potential for off-target interaction of ozanimod and metabolites was assessed in a CEREP® panel of 
at least 55 receptors, transporters, and ion channels. Adequate clinical margins were demonstrated for 
all  identified  receptor  interactions.  However,  CC112273  was  identified  to  effectively  block  MAO-B 
(IC50=5.72nM)  with  >1000-fold  selectivity  over  MAO-A,  whereas  ozanimod  interfered  with  serotonin 
uptake  in vitro  (IC50=1.74 µM).  Still,  ozanimod  or  CC112273  neither  induced,  nor  exacerbated  pre-
existing serotonin syndrome in mice at 1.8 to 4.3-fold higher CC112273 plasma levels than determined 
in plasma of RRMS patients receiving the recommended clinical ozanimod therapy.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  evaluated  neuromuscular,  respiratory,  and  cardiovascular  system 
interactions.  Suitable clinical margins to the inhibition of Ikr currents mediated by the hERG channel 
were obtained with ozanimod and metabolites. Telemetered male monkeys administered up to 30 mg/kg 
ozanimod exhibited minor and transient increases in the PR interval, decreased diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP), and decreased heart rate (HR) at suitable multiples above the clinical exposure. Rat respiratory 
function was evaluated by plethysmography and initially identified only minor increases in respiratory 
rate  and  minor  decreases  in  tidal  volume  in  a  non-Good  laboratory  practice  (GLP)  study,  leaving  the 
minute volume unchanged at the highest dose tested. In a subsequent GLP compliant study, however, 
daily oral ozanimod doses of 2 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg for 7 days remarkably increased lung weights of 
rats  by  40  and  90  %,  which  was  accompanied  by  progressively  impaired  respiration.  These  adverse 
findings were later confirmed in the toxicology program (see below). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
With respect to the specific mechanism of action of ozanimod at S1P1 and S1P5 receptors and the lack 
of relevant “off-target” affinities to other receptors, no pharmacodynamic drug interaction was studied.

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The ADME (Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) characteristics of ozanimod and its main 
metabolites were investigated in vitro as well as in mice, rats, rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys in vivo 
and further complemented by toxicokinetic determinations in these species. 
Ozanimod  is  a  highly  permeable  compound,  with  in vitro  bidirectional  permeability  across  Caco-2 
monolayers indicating its principal intestinal absorption by passive diffusion. Accordingly, ozanimod was 
rapidly and dose-proportionally absorbed in all animal species with similar Tmax in mice (1 h), rats and 
monkeys (4 h) and humans (Tmax=6-8 h).  
Following oral dosing, ozanimod was readily absorbed with oral bioavailability ranging from 40% to 60% 
in rat. In repeat-dose PK or toxicology studies in mice, rats, monkeys, and rabbits, systemic exposure 
of ozanimod and its metabolites remained unchanged and independent of dosing duration, consistent 
with their t½ in preclinical species.  
Plasma protein binding of ozanimod in animal species used for toxicity testing was generally high and 
comparable with humans (approximately 98% or greater) with preference for lipoproteins, albumin and 
α1-acid glycoprotein. Ozanimod readily distributed into cellular elements of blood (blood to plasma ratio 
2  to  4).  Ozanimod  and  its  metabolites,  except  for  RP101124  and  RP101988,  exhibited  wide  tissue 
distribution with highest levels in lungs, kidneys, liver, CNS, endocrine and exocrine glands, spleen, bone 
marrow and uveal tract of the eyes. Higher levels were additionally detected in pigmented compared to 
non-pigmented skin suggesting melanin-binding. 
Ozanimod and its metabolites RP101988, RP101124, RP101075 and RP101442 crossed the placenta in 
rats and rabbits. About 22.5-34.4% of the maternal ozanimod dose was detected in plasma of GD18 rat 
foetuses, which further increases if the contribution of all active metabolites is additionally considered. 
Ozanimod was also excreted into the milk of lactating rats and particularly the RP101988 metabolite was 
confirmed at 24.5-fold higher levels than in maternal plasma. Although the foetal exposure of the major 
active  human  metabolites  CC112273  and  CC1084037  was  not  investigated,  their  placental  and  milk 
transfer can be expected given their structural and physico-chemical similarities with ozanimod. 
Ozanimod  was  subject  to  extensive  metabolism  via  multiple  biotransformation  pathways  resulting  in 
qualitatively  comparable,  but  quantitatively  different  amounts  of  metabolites.  It  underwent  primary 
metabolism  via  three  distinct  pathways:  aldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  alcohol  dehydrogenase 
(ALDH/ADH) mediated oxidation of primary alcohol metabolite RP101988, CYP3A4 mediated dealkylation 
of methylene hydroxy function resulting in the formation of the indamine metabolite RP101075, and gut 
microbial mediated oxadiazole ring scission resulting in RP101124. Metabolite RP101075 was subject to 
N-acetylation resulting in RP101442. Nevertheless, RP101075 was principally metabolized by MAO-B to 
the indanone metabolite CC112273. CC112273 underwent further reversible metabolism with carbonyl 
reduction  to  form  CC1084037  which  in  turn  was  rapidly  converted  back  via  oxidation  by  aldo-keto 
reductases  and  hydroxy  steroid  dehydrogenases  to  CC112273.  No  other  down-stream  metabolites  of 
CC1084037  were  identified,  so  the  interconversion  kinetics  obviously  favour  formation  of  CC112273. 
CC112273 also undergoes CYP2C8 hydroxylation on the indanone ring to form RP112509. Thus, no single 
metabolic pathway or enzyme system predominates in the overall metabolism of ozanimod.  
The exposures of the two major active (CC112273 and CC1084037) and the main inactive (RP101124) 
human metabolites were assessed using validated methods in repeat dose PK and/or toxicity studies. 
Exposures  of  these  major  metabolites  increased  approximately  dose-proportionally  following  repeat 
dosing of ozanimod in animals and did not show accumulation or sex differences in exposures. Consistent 
with half-lives of ozanimod and its metabolites in nonclinical species, 14 day repeat dosing studies were 
sufficient to achieve steady-state for parent and metabolites. Although CC112273 and CC1084037 were 
also identified in nonclinical species, they were present at significantly higher levels in humans than in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 26/188 
 
 
 
rodents  and  rabbits.  In  monkeys,  the  exposure  of  CC112273  was  equivalent  to  ozanimod,  whereas 
CC1084037  was  about  4-fold  reduced.  Interestingly,  direct  repeated  oral  or  single  intravenous 
administration of CC112273 or CC1084037 resulted in even lower and clearly less than dose-proportional 
systemic exposure in rodents and monkeys than following administration of ozanimod in these species. 
At elevated doses, the exposure of both major metabolites reached a plateau and did not outperform 
their levels at comparable ozanimod dosages. Due to the poor solubility of CC112273 and CC1084037, 
their  systemic exposure  could  also  not  be  increased  by  IV  or  SC  administration.  Accordingly,  animals 
were unambiguously exposed to much lower levels of the disproportionate metabolites CC112273 and 
CC1084037  than  humans.  Enhanced  clearance  of  CC112273  and  CC1084037  obviously  prevails  in 
animals  as  evident  by  much  shorter  terminal  elimination  half-lives  in  rats  (t1/2 =8.8  to  31.8 h  after 
ozanimod  vs.  3.7 h  after  direct  CC112273  p.o.  dosing),  mice  (8  to  24 h  after  direct  CC112273  p.o. 
dosing) and monkeys (11 h after ozanimod p.o. administration) compared to humans (t1/2 ~10 days in 
humans). 
In  contrast,  the  exposure  of  the  major  inactive  human  metabolite  RP101124  was  1.9-2.8-fold  higher 
than ozanimod in rats and 2.3- to 4-fold lower in mice and monkeys. From the minor active metabolites 
representing  <5 %  of  total  drug-related  AUC  in  humans,  only  RP101988  reached  similar  levels  like 
ozanimod  in  rats  and  monkeys  and  was  detected  in  2-fold  lower  amounts  in  mice.  Other  minor 
metabolites did not reach appreciable exposures in animals. 
In rats, the faecal route of excretion predominated accounting for elimination of approximately 83% of 
the administered radioactive dose within 48 h. Minor amounts of radioactive dose were excreted in urine 
(5% to 8% of dose). Evaluation in bile-duct cannulated rats revealed that the hepatobiliary elimination 
is  the  predominant  excretory  route  for  the  absorbed  fraction  of  [14C]-ozanimod.  The  excreted 
radioactivity was composed primarily of metabolites, with trace amounts of unchanged parent. 
In pharmacokinetic interaction studies, CC112273 and CC1084037 and RP101075 selectively inhibited 
MAO-B  with  IC50  values  of  5.7nM,  58nM  and  56.13nM,  respectively.  RP101075  additionally  showed 
moderate interference with MAO-A (IC50=1322nM). Inhibition of MAO-B is adequately addressed in the 
section  5.2  of  SmPC  (Summary  of  Product  Characteristics).  Ozanimod  was  a  weak  inhibitor  of  P-gp 
(IC50=8800nM)  and  Breast  cancer  resistance  protein  (BCRP)  (IC50=3500nM).  CC112273,  CC1084037, 
RP101075, RP101988 and RP101124 served as substrates for BCRP and both major active metabolites 
CC112273 and CC1084037 were BCRP inhibitors (IC50=25.2 and 22.8nM, respectively), but at clinically 
relevant concentrations, the free maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) to IC50 ratio is expected to be 
<0.1;  therefore,  they  are  not  expected  to  cause  drug-drug  interactions  (DDI)  with  BCRP  substrates. 
Neither  ozanimod,  nor  its  metabolites  were  inhibitors  of  efflux  transporter  MATE1  and  MATE2-K,  or 
uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Moreover,  ozanimod  and  its  metabolites  unveiled  no  significant  induction  or  inhibitory  potential  of 
CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2C8,  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4  enzymes.  Furthermore,  the  two 
glucuronidated metabolites RP101124 and RP112402 did not inhibit UGT family members. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted. This is supported by the current guidelines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 27/188 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  comprised  studies  with  administration  of  ozanimod  to  mice,  rats  and 
Cynomolgus monkeys and studies with direct administration of metabolites CC112273, RP101075 and 
RP101442 to mice and/or rats. All studies employed the oral route of administration. 
The main repeated dose toxicity studies have been conducted in Sprague Dawley rats and Cynomolgus 
monkeys with daily oral administration of ozanimod for up to 26 and 39 weeks, respectively. In each of 
these animal species, in addition to the GLP chronic toxicity studies, ozanimod was tested in GLP 28 days 
and 13 weeks duration studies, with all studies, except for the 13 weeks, including a recovery period. 
Overall,  these  investigations  revealed  comparable  toxicity  targets  across  species.  However,  no 
pronounced  toxicities  were  observed  even  in  dose  range  finding  studies,  hence,  precluding  the 
determination of maximum tolerated doses.  
Chronic administration of ozanimod had similar effects in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, with changes 
in haematological parameters (decrease in leucocytes, namely, T- but also B-lymphocytes) and lymphoid 
organs  (decrease  cellularity).  In  line  with  the  role  of  S1P1  receptor  in  maintaining  endothelial  barrier 
integrity  within  the  lungs,  ozanimod  also  dose-dependently  induced  prominent  alterations  in  lungs  of 
mice,  rats  and  monkeys  including  juvenile  animals  (increase  in  weight  and  alveolar  histiocytosis 
/accumulation of foamy macrophages). In both rats and monkeys, the severity of these lung toxicities 
did not deteriorate in long-term toxicity studies, but they were incompletely reversible after the 6 weeks 
recovery  period  and  served  to  determine  the  no  observed  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)s  (0.2  and 
0.1 mg/kg/day in rats and monkeys, respectively) in these investigations. 
The Applicant’s position that additional effects observed in shorter term studies in rats and Cynomolgus 
monkeys were attributed to stress or part of the background spectrum present in animals from different 
vendors and studies run in different locations was accepted as these effects were absent from the chronic 
toxicity studies. Similar doses levels were employed in the chronic and shorter-term studies in rats and 
different  ozanimod  batches  were  used  in  the  chronic  studies  (Batch  No.  AJ506FP-11-001,  purity  of 
99.5%) versus the 28 days and 13 weeks studies (Batch No. AJ501 FPRP-10-001, purity of 99.2%) in 
rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. Furthermore, in relation to those observed in the chronic toxicity studies 
with  administration  of  ozanimod,  no  new  toxicities  were  identified  in  studies  conducted  with  direct 
administration of the metabolites CC112273, RP101075 or RP101442. Effects of ozanimod in the 28 days 
repeated dose toxicity study in CByB6F1 mice were also generally identical to findings observed in the 
chronic toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Concerning safety margins/exposure multiples, the chronic toxicity studies included toxicokinetic analysis 
for ozanimod and its metabolites RP101075, RP101442, RP101988 and RP101124, where the first 3 are 
active metabolites (the 28 days and 13 weeks studies included toxicokinetic analysis for ozanimod and 
its  metabolites  RP101075  and  RP101442  only).  However,  in  humans,  the  major  metabolites  were 
identified after completion of the pivotal toxicity studies as CC112273, CC1084037 and RP101124, with 
the first two being pharmacologically active and, together with ozanimod, contributing to 94% of total 
active exposure of the drug in humans. Therefore, the systemic exposures of CC112273 and CC1084037 
in  the  chronic  toxicity  studies  had  to  be  retrospectively  estimated  based  on  those  determined  in  GLP 
compliant 14-days pharmacokinetic bridging studies conducted in Sprague Dawley rats and Cynomolgus 
monkeys  (as  well  as  in  mice  and  rabbits).  Based  on  measured  or  estimated  exposures  (AUC),  at  the 
chronic toxicity NOAEL, in rats, systemic exposures to ozanimod, the metabolites RP101124, CC112273 
and CC1084037 and total active drug in humans (ozanimod+CC112273+CC1084037) were calculated 
to  be  10.4-,  17.7-,  0.0446-,  0.0036-  and  0.62-times,  respectively,  those  expected  in  humans.  In 
Cynomolgus  monkeys,  these  multiples  at  the  NOAEL  were  3.73,  0.445,  0.316,  0.363  and  0.515, 
respectively.  Due  to  the  substantial  pharmacokinetic  differences  between  animals  and  humans 
delineated above, systemic exposure levels in animals to the disproportionate main active and persistent 
Assessment report

human  metabolites  CC112273  and  CC1084037  and  even  to  total  active  drug  at  the  NOAEL  were, 
therefore, clearly lower than those expected in patients at the maximum recommended ozanimod dose. 
This information was added in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Genotoxicity 
The  Applicant  provided  a  characterisation  of  the  genotoxic  profile  of  ozanimod  and  most  relevant 
metabolites.  Some  of  the  assays  were  conducted  in  a  non-GLP  setting  but  all  relevant  ones  were 
conducted in compliance with GLP. The Applicant presented both in vitro and in vivo data.  
All GLP-compliant bacterial reverse mutation assays (with or without metabolic activation) were negative 
for ozanimod, and metabolites RP110351, CC112273, CC1084037. Additionally, some non-GLP bacterial 
reverse mutation studies were performed with two minor metabolites (RP101075 and RP101442) and 
they were all negative. 
Also, in a GLP-compliant mouse lymphoma assay ozanimod did not induce any biologically significant 
increase in the mutant frequency for the long treatment period (~24 hours) in the absence of metabolic 
activation, and for the short treatment period (~4 hours) either with or without metabolic activation. 
In another GLP compliant study, the metabolite CC112273 was tested for the ability to induce structural 
chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, with and without metabolic activation, 
and CC112273 was negative. 
Also, the ability for CC1084037, and/or its metabolites, to induce micronuclei in TK6 cells in the presence 
and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system was tested and here, CC1084037 was positive 
for  the  induction  of  micronuclei  in  the  non-activated  test  system  in  the  in  vitro  mammalian  cell 
micronucleus test using TK6 cells. To further assess this in vitro TK6 result, an additional combined in 
vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus and hepatic Comet assay was conducted with CC1084037 and for 
ozanimod. The negative bone marrow micronucleus result and the negative hepatic Comet assay results 
for CC1084037 provided by the Applicant gave enough assurance of the absence of genotoxic activity 
and  no  additional  tests  were  warranted  according  to  the  prevailing  ICH  S2(R1)  guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008). 
Carcinogenicity 
Once-daily  (QD)  oral  administration  of  ozanimod  to  Tg.rasH2  mice  at  dose  levels  of  8,  25,  and  80 
mg/kg/day for 26 weeks identified a statistically significant increased incidence of hemangiosarcoma in 
males and females at all doses. Although the hemangiosarcoma incidence in the low dose group remained 
within  laboratory  background  levels,  the  combined  non-splenic  haemangioma/hemangiosarcoma 
exceeded the historical control range. Therefore, considering the low dose as no observed effect level 
(NOEL) for hemangiosarcoma was regarded critical.   
The  driving  mechanism  for  hemangiosarcoma  development in  mice  may  be  stimulation  of  endothelial 
cells through S1P1 (also known as the EDG1 receptor; Pognan et al., 2018). This receptor is abundant 
on vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and is important for endothelial cell migration, differentiation, and 
survival. In mice, S1P1 agonism results in sustained production of placental growth factor 2 (PlGF-2) and 
subsequently,  persistent  VEC  mitoses.  In  contrast,  rat  and  human  VEC  do  not  release  PlGF-2  or only 
transiently  release  PlGF-2.  Sustained  VEC  stimulation  and/or  hemangiosarcoma  formation  are  not 
observed in these species (Pognan et al., 2018). Although the hemangiosarcoma may not be relevant in 
other  species  than  mice,  a  critical  point  in  this  study  is  the  obviously  minor  exposure  ratio  for  the 
disproportionate major active human metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 at the low dose level with 
only insignificant 2.95- and 1.4-fold safety margins compared to human exposure at the proposed clinical

dose. The fact that the incidence of hemangiosarcoma was statistically increased at the low dose level 
in males was therefore reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, ozanimod administered daily to at up to 2 mg/kg did not cause 
any test article-related neoplastic lesions. In fact, the NOAEL for toxicity could be generally considered 
satisfactory. The major drawback of this 2-year study is the insufficient exposure of the active human 
disproportionate  metabolites  CC112273  and  CC1084037,  which  had  not  been  identified  as  major 
metabolites  at  the  time  the  study  was  conducted  and,  hence,  their  contribution  to  the  active  drug 
exposure was not part of the criteria for dose selection and the dose selection was based primarily on 
the parent compound ozanimod. This information was included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive  and  development  toxicity  studies  comprised  studies  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic 
development, embryo-foetal development (EFD), pre-/postnatal development (PPND) and studies with 
direct  dosing  of  juvenile  animals.  Studies  on  embryo-foetal  development  were  conducted  in  rats  and 
rabbits, while all the others were conducted in rats only. Administration of ozanimod was investigated in 
all studies, except a pilot pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study in rabbits, which tested the major 
human active metabolites CC112273. All studies used the oral route of administration. 
Ozanimod impaired neither reproductive performance and fertility nor early embryonic development in 
rats.  The  exposure  margin  at  the  NOAEL  of  30  mg/kg/day  corresponds  to  155-times  the  human 
exposure,  when  based  on  the  total  amount  of  active  drug  (ozanimod,  CC112273  and  CC1084037) 
determined in a bridging PK study at this dose level.  
In the EFD study in rats, embryotoxicity was evident as significantly increased embryolethality at dosages 
above the NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day, leaving less litters and pups for morphological examination in the high 
dose group. External malformations were noted in one low dose foetus (cyst extending from axilla to 
neck,  classified  as  malformation  in  the  study  report),  and  3 high  dose  foetuses  out  of  2 litters  with 
anasarca. Another foetus from a separate litter showed a local oedema which was classified as anomaly. 
At  visceral  examination  the  same  foetus  also  presented  with  cleft  palate.  Two  other  foetuses  had 
bilaterally  non  descended testes.  Anasarca  is  considered  treatment-related  due  to  the  role  of  S1P1  in 
vascular permeability. These findings coincide with data available for the S1P1 knockout mouse, where 
germline knockout is embryonic lethal due the generalized haemorrhage (embryonic day 12.5 to 14.5). 
At the NOAEL determined in rats, a low safety margin (3.5-fold) compared to exposure of patients to 
total active drug (ozanimod, CC112273 and CC1084037) at the MHRD was obtained. 
In rabbits, ozanimod similarly induced embryolethality (abortion, post-implantation loss) and teratogenic 
effects  (malformed  /absent  blood  vessels;  malpositioned  caudal  vertebrae).  However,  in  this  species, 
malformations were already noted at the lowest dose level and consequently no NOAEL and no safety 
margin with respect to clinical exposure could be established. 
In order to obtain higher exposures to the major active human metabolite CC112273, a DRF study with 
oral administration of the metabolite was conducted in rabbits. However, based upon the poor exposure 
using direct oral administration of CC112273, the decision was made not to perform a definitive embryo-
foetal rabbit study. 
In  the  PPND  study  in  rats,  adverse  effects  on  pre-weaning  body  weights  without  any  impact  on 
developmental parameters were noted in the offspring of the high dose group. Across all groups, single 
instances  of  different  macroscopic  findings  (e.g.  malpositioned  kidney,  discoloration  of  lungs  or  liver, 
small aortic arch and persistent truncus arteriosus, umbilical hernia in the dose groups, and situs inversus 
in the control group) were evident either in stillborn or culled pups, or pups that died during the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 30/188 
 
 
 
Out  of  these  findings  special  attention  was  drawn  to  the  finding  “small  aortic  arch  and  the  persistent 
truncus arteriosus” noted in a female mid dose pup which died on study. It was obvious to consider these 
findings as treatment related due to the role of S1P1 in vascular development during embryogenesis, and 
as  similar  findings  had  been  observed  in  rabbit  foetuses  following  treatment  with  ozanimod  during 
organogenesis. However, malformations of the great vessels were not observed in any of the rat foetuses 
following exposure during organogenesis in the embryo-foetal development study. Consequently, these 
findings were judged of uncertain relationship to the test article. 
After weaning, behavioural parameters were not negatively influenced in any dose group, except motor 
activity on postnatal day 35. Male offspring demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in the number of 
rearings and high dose females showed a significant increase in the number of fine movements and the 
total distance. Interestingly, basic movement, mean fine movement and mean total distance were also 
significantly increased in female pups at a higher dose (10 mg/kg/day) in the pivotal 10 weeks juvenile 
toxicity study when tested at the same age (postnatal day 35). The relevance of these finding for humans 
is unclear and should be discussed in the context of a future application for a paediatric indication. 
These data are reflected in section 5.3 of SmPC.  
Local Tolerance  
Ozanimod is being developed as a medical product administered by the oral route. The absence of local 
tolerance studies is agreed in line with recommendations of CHMP/EMA Guideline on non-clinical local 
tolerance testing of medicinal products (effective 1 May 2016). 
Other toxicity studies 
Ozanimod and its major active human metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 maximally absorb around 
280 nm followed by a minor decline at 320 nm, while the absorbance of the inactive major metabolite 
RP101124  peaks  at  301 nm.  At  290  or  301 nm,  the  corresponding  Molar  Extinction  Coefficients  of  all 
four  compounds  were  clearly  above  the  threshold  level  of  1000 l·mol-1·cm-1  of  the  pertinent  ICH S10 
guideline (EMA/CHMP/ICH/752211/2012). Since ozanimod accumulates in the uveal tract of the eyes for 
more  than  21 days  and  presumably  binds  to  melanin-containing  structures,  the  lack  of  a  phototoxic 
potential  was  confirmed  for  ozanimod  and  its  primary  metabolites  RP101075  and  RP101988  in  GLP 
compliant neutral red uptake phototoxicity assays in Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts irradiated with UVA 
light (320 and 400 nm).  
Immunotoxicity  assessment  revealed  the  expected  pharmacological  action  of  decreased  T-  and 
B-lymphocyte  counts  and  an  inhibitory  effect  on  primary  and  secondary  T-dependent  IgM  and  IgG 
antibody responses.  Examination of ozanimod in rat juvenile toxicity studies identified the same effects 
as  in  adult  rats  (i.e.,  decreased  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes,  increased  lung  weights,  and increased 
alveolar macrophages) as reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The  qualification  of  impurities  present  in  the  ozanimod  drug  substance  was  based  on  analysis  of  the 
ozanimod lot administered to the rat and monkey in the GLP-compliant nonclinical studies (rat 26-week 
and monkey 39 week). These studies identified NOAELs of 0.2 mg/kg/day in the rat and 0.1 mg/kg/day 
in  the  monkey.  The  human  equivalent  dose  was  calculated  based  on  the  FDA  Guidance  for  Industry 
(Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy 
Volunteers, 2005) and assumed a 60-kg human body weight. The safety factor was derived as the ratio 
between the qualified levels of each impurity and the content in the MHRD of 1 mg ozanimod HCl (0.92 
mg ozanimod). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 31/188 
 
 
 
Based on the results of repeated dose toxicology studies, RP-101948 was qualified at a level of 0.18% 
in the rat and monkey. The rat and monkey toxicology lot impurity percentage cover a human exposure 
limit  of  3.48 µg/day  for  RP101948  corresponding  to  a  relative  amount  of  0.348%  in  the  MHRD.  The 
specification for the impurity content of RP-101948 is 0.3%, resulting in maximum specified dose of 3 µg 
RP-101948 at the MHRD of 1 mg ozanimod HCl. The qualified impurity level has a safety factor of 1.16 
(3.48 µg  exposure  limit/3 µg  maximum  specified  dose)  and  is  well  below  the  1 mg/day  limit  of  the 
ICH M7(R1) guideline (see Note 1 of EMA/CHMP/ICH/83812/2013). 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment was submitted in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental 
Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*). 
The  log  Kow  of  ozanimod  HCl  was  experimentally  determined  under  GLP  conditions  at  pH 4,  7  and  9 
following the shake flask method in accordance with the OECD 107 guideline. The resulting logKow was 
1.1, 3.0 and 4.4 at pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively, and thus the Applicant’s position that a PBT assessment 
was not required was agreed by the CHMP (Table 1). 
The PECsurfacewater in phase I taking into consideration the member state with the highest prevalence of 
RRMS in Europe and the maximum daily dose of 0.92 mg/day was found to be below the action limit of 
0.01 µg/L. Therefore, a phase II assessment was not required (Table 1).

2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Ozanimod hydrochloride  (HCl)  (also  known  as  RPC1063)  is  a  potent,  orally  bioavailable,  S1P  agonist, 
which binds with high affinity and selectively to S1P1 and S1P5. Agonist activation of S1P1 induces down-
modulation of cell surface S1P1 expression which results in lymphocyte retention in lymphoid tissues that 
is thought to ameliorate the pathological processes associated with MS. 
Ozanimod is being developed for the clinical treatment of patients with RRMS. The proposed MHRD for 
the treatment of this condition is one milligram (1 mg) ozanimod HCl per day. 
All relevant non-clinical aspects were presented and discussed above. From the point of view of non-
clinical pharmacodynamics, no specific concerns arose, and the position of the Applicant was generally 
endorsed.  
Assessment report

In  terms  of  non-clinical  pharmacokinetics,  one  specific  concern  needed  further  discussion.  Following 
multiple dosing in humans, the majority of active drug in circulation is CC112273 (73%), followed by 
CC1084037 (15%) and ozanimod (6%). Although CC112273 and CC1084037 were present in nonclinical 
species, they were present at significantly higher levels in humans than in rodents and rabbits. It was 
acknowledged that systemic delivery of metabolites to improve the exposures was not feasible due to 
poor solubility of CC112273 and CC1084037 in vehicles suitable for IV or SC administration, and that 
higher CC112273 and CC1084037 exposures were obtained via administration of the parent compound, 
ozanimod.  However,  from  the  data  originally  provided  by  the  Applicant,  it  was  not  clear  that,  in  all 
species,  human  major  metabolites  (CC112273,  CC1084037,  and  RP101124)  attained  sufficient 
exposures  for  adequate  characterization  of  its  in  vivo  pharmacology  and  toxicity.  In  response  to  this 
concern, the Applicant stated that “major active metabolites are structurally similar to ozanimod with 
comparable  activity  and 
selectivity,  and 
the 
combined 
total  active  drug  exposures 
(ozanimod+CC112273+CC1084037) demonstrate sufficient exposures for adequate characterization of 
toxicity”. This response was considered not acceptable. The use of combined total active drug exposures 
may  be  acceptable  for  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect,  considering  the  similar  activity  and 
selectivity for human S1P1 and S1P5 and also similar activity for rat and Cynomolgus monkey S1P1 and 
S1P5, but structural similarity did not provide reassurance on the safety profile of a drug. In fact, the 
mean  steady-state  AUC0-t/AUC0-24  of  CC112273  was  nearly  comparable  to  ozanimod  in  monkeys,  but 
1.5- to 2-fold lower in rabbits, ≥8.5-fold lower in rats and ≥13.4-fold lower in mice. The exposure of 
CC1084037  was  even  ≥189.5-fold  lower  in  rats,  ≥19.5-fold  lower  in  mice  and  ≥3.2-fold  lower  in 
monkeys. This contradicts the predominance and persistence of CC112273 and CC1084037 in humans, 
which represent the majority of the human drug-related AUC (66% and 13%, respectively), and can be 
attributed to the enhanced clearance of CC112273 and CC1084037 in animals compared to humans (t1/2 
~19–22 h in animals vs. ~10 days in humans). Consequently, clinically relevant exposure levels (AUC0-
t/AUC0-24)  of  CC112273  CC1084037  were  not  attained  at  the  NOAEL  in  the  toxicology  program  of 
ozanimod  and  not  at  even  higher  dosages  in  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  as  well  as  the 
embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits. The Applicant was requested to address the clinical 
implications  of  the  inadequate  coverage  of  CC112273  and  CC1084037  levels  in  the  above-mentioned 
studies  by  amendments  of  sections 4.4  and  4.6  of  the  SmPC  concerning  the  embryo-foetal  risks  and 
section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  concerning  carcinogenic  risks  (immunosuppressive  effects  and  cutaneous 
neoplasms). 
As noticed earlier in the safety pharmacology study on respiratory function, ozanimod dose-dependently 
induced pronounced oedema and histiocytosis in the lungs of mice, rats and monkeys, which manifested 
in increased organ weights in these species. The premature death of three rats, which presented with 
multiple oedema/haemorrhage in the chronic toxicity study might have been additionally impacted by 
this lung toxicity. While changes in haematological parameters and lymphoid organs, observed in the 
same  studies,  were  clearly  related  to  the  intended  pharmacological  activity  of  ozanimod/its  active 
metabolites, the same did not appear to apply to the changes in lungs. Comparable adverse lung findings 
had been earlier reported for S1P modulators in rats, dogs and monkeys and were mechanistically related 
to the breakdown of the endothelial barrier in the lungs by S1P1 receptor modulation (Shea et al., 2010; 
Oo  et al.,  2011).  In  view  of  the  lack  of  any  safety  margins  concerning  exposure  of  the  major  active 
metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 in animals with regard to therapeutic ozanimod administration 
in  humans,  the  Applicant  implemented  a  warning  regarding  clinical  respiratory  effects  of  ozanimod 
demanding its cautious use in patients with severe respiratory disease, pulmonary fibrosis and chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  in  line  with  the  currently  approved  SmPC  of  another  S1P 
modulator and reported lung toxicities in non-clinical studies as included in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
In  relation  to  the  pharmacological  relevance  of  the  animal  models,  in vitro  pharmacological  studies 
showed that ozanimod and its major active metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 share similar activity 
at human, murine and rat S1P1 receptors, while the affinity of CC112273 for human and murine S1P5 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 33/188 
 
 
 
was  3-fold  lower  and  that  of  CC1084037  about  3-fold  higher  compared  to  ozanimod.  In line  with  the 
>94%  identity  in  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  human  and  monkey  S1P  receptors,  the  Applicant  also 
confirmed the comparable affinity and selectivity of ozanimod at S1P1 and S1P5 receptors of Cynomolgus 
monkeys as observed in humans. Likewise, ozanimod, CC112273 and CC1084037 demonstrated similar 
binding profiles to S1P5 receptors of rats as earlier determined in mice. 
No  relevant  genotoxic  potential  of  ozanimod  and  its  major  metabolites  was  apparent  when  tested  in 
accordance  with  the  ICH  S2(R1)  guideline  (EMA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008).  With  respect  to  the 
carcinogenicity  studies  of  ozanimod,  the  insufficient  exposure  to  the  two  human  active  metabolites 
CC112273 and CC1084037 was considered as a major drawback and reflected for the 2-year study in 
rats in section 5.3 of the SmPC. Likewise, the statistically increased incidence of haemangiosarcoma at 
the  low  dose  level  in  males  of  the  26 weeks  carcinogenicity  study  in  transgenic  Tg  rasH2  mice  was 
detailed in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Concerning  data on  reproductive  toxicity,  the  Applicant  clarified that  a  definitive  EFD  study  in  rabbits 
with direct oral administration of the metabolite CC112273 was not conducted. The Applicant also agreed 
that a NOAEL could not be set regarding EFD in rabbits (i.e. the NOAEL was below the lowest tested dose 
of 0.2 mg/kg/day ozanimod). Finally, the Applicant agreed that vascular findings in rats and rabbits were 
consistent  with  expected  S1P1  pharmacology  and  that  teratogenic  effects  occurred  at  total  agonist 
exposures  that  were  at  or  near  the  clinical  dose.  However,  the  Applicant  considered  the  great  vessel 
malformation observed in one dead pup of the mid dose group in the PPND study of uncertain relationship 
to the drug substance, due to the absence of any major vessels changes or cardiac abnormalities in the 
treated  pups  in  the  EFD  study.  These  concerns  were  therefore  considered  resolved  and  these  safety 
findings were satisfactorily reflected in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Given the established role of the S1P1 receptor in vasculogenesis (Ben Shoham et al., 2012; Pyne and 
Pyne, 2017), five cases of abnormal foetal development among 66 pregnancies with in utero exposure 
to fingolimod (Karlsson et al., 2014) and the embryo lethality and teratogenicity in both rats and rabbits 
administered ozanimod in the EFD studies, it was reasonable to assume that ozanimod could cause foetal 
harm  when  used  in  pregnant  women.  As  a  consequence,  an  absolute  contraindication  for  the  use  of 
ozanimod during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception was 
included in section 4.3 as requested. Also, in line with other S1P modulators, the same risk minimisation 
measures were implemented in sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC regarding the risk for teratogenicity. 
Postnatal development was not affected by maternal treatment with ozanimod except for some effects 
noted  in  motor  activity  parameters.  After  weaning,  behavioural  parameters  were  not  negatively 
influenced in any dose group, except motor activity on postnatal day 35. Male offspring demonstrated a 
dose-dependent decrease in the number of rearings and high dose females showed a significant increase 
in the number of fine movements and the total distance. The relevance of these findings for humans is 
unclear but they were not considered adverse in the study report. Nevertheless, basic movement, mean 
fine movement and mean total distance were also significantly increased in female pups at a higher dose 
(10 mg/kg/day) in the 10 weeks juvenile toxicity study when tested at the same age (postnatal day 35). 
This should be discussed in detail at the time a paediatric indication is applied for. The juvenile parts of 
the nonclinical overview as well as of the documentation have to be revised prior to any extension of the 
currently proposed indication due to major inconsistencies identified.  
The absence of a phototoxic potential was confirmed for ozanimod and its primary metabolites RP101075 
and RP101988 in 3T3 NRU in vitro assays. However, the fibroblasts in these assays were irradiated with 
UVA light (320 and 400 nm). Given the absorption maxima of ozanimod, CC112273, CC1084037 and 
RP101124 (~290 and 301 nm, respectively), it is unfortunate that the more appropriate UVB range (280-
315 nm)  was  not  additionally  tested  to  strengthen  the  validity  of  the  assay  results.  Nonetheless,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 34/188 
 
 
 
Applicant  elucidated  that  the  specific  methodological  recommendations  of  the  pertinent  OECD 
guideline 432 for appropriate irradiation conditions had been followed.  
In  view  of  the  carboxylic  acid  functional  group,  the  Applicant  considered  the  main  inactive  human 
metabolite  RP101124  additionally  more  hydrophilic  than  ozanimod,  which  should  limit  its  tissue 
distribution including light-exposed structures. The Applicant further claimed that the benzoic acid moiety 
of  RP101124  is  similarly  contained  within  its  parent  compound  rendering  specific  phototoxicity  of  the 
metabolite  unnecessary  in  line  with  the  ICH S10  guideline  (EMA/CHMP/ICH/752211/2012).  As  an 
additional  argument,  benzoic  acid,  a  common  pH adjustor  and  preservative  within  cosmetic  products 
comprising also suntan lotions, lacks a phototoxic potential. Further confidence is gained by the much 
lower absorption of RP101124 in the range of natural sunlight compared to ozanimod, CC112273 and 
CC1084037. It was therefore agreed, that no dedicated phototoxicity test was required for RP101124. 
Despite the lack of skin tumours in the toxicology program of ozanimod, increased cutaneous neoplasms 
have meanwhile been identified in MS patients treated with other S1P receptor modulators prompting 
recent  amendments  of  their  SmPC.  With  respect  to  the  established  role  of  the  S1P1  receptor  in 
tumorigenesis (Yamaguchi et al., 2003; Pyne and Pyne, 2010; Kishimoto et al., 2011; Reimann et al., 
2015), the lack of experience from long-term clinical ozanimod therapy and the generally wide tissue 
distribution  of  ozanimod  including  the  eyes  and  skin,  the  potential  risk  for  skin  neoplasms  has  been 
included as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC has meanwhile implemented for other S1P modulators 
(see EMA/688187/2015, EMA/82227145/2017 and also clinical evaluation). 
Finally,  the  Applicant  verified  the  log  Kow  of  ozanimod  HCl  and  the  Applicant’s  position  that  a  PBT 
assessment was not required was agreed by the CHMP.  
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The findings in the chronic toxicology, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicology studies appeared to 
be target mediated effects of S1P1 agonists. These include peripheral blood lymphopenia, increased lung 
weights  and  mononuclear  alveolar  infiltrates,  species-specific  hemangiosarcoma  in  mice,  and  great 
vessel abnormalities during foetal development. Overall, the data presented in this nonclinical package 
were  regarded  acceptable  for  marketing  authorization  of  ozanimod,  although  the  safe  clinical 
administration  of  ozanimod  could  not  be  reliably  concluded  due  to  substantial  pharmacokinetic 
differences  between  all  animal  species  and  humans  leading  to  insufficient  exposure  to  the  major 
disproportionate  active  human  metabolites  CC112273  and  CC1084037  in  toxicology  studies.  Thus, 
adequate risk minimisation measures in accordance with other S1P modulators were implemented.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
The overall assay performance (accuracy, precision) of quality control standards (ozanimod) complied 
with  acceptance  limits  recommended  in  the  appropriate  guideline.  The  metabolites  CC112273  and 
CC1084037  and  their  contribution  to  the  active  moiety  have  been  elucidated  lately  in  the  clinical 
development. CC112273 has been investigated in 8 studies, including PK after multiple dosing and in 
renal and hepatic impaired population. Data of CC1084037 have been provided only for two studies. 
The  incurred  sample  reanalysis  of  RP101075  showed  ISR  failures  during  sample  analysis  which  were 
attributable  to  the  low  concentrations  of  RP101075  (<10pg/mL)  in  the  study  samples  relative  to  the 
range of the assay. In samples where the concentration of RP101075 was above 40pg/mL, the passing 
rate for ISRs met the criteria. Moreover, RP101075 is a minor metabolite with demonstrated coverage 
in  preclinical  toxicology  species  and  is  not  a  key  determinant  for  understanding  exposure-efficacy 
relationship. 
Long term stability data have been updated in the bioanalytical reports, e.g. in study RPC01-1906, for 
analyte RP112273, long term-stability has been updated for 392 days at -70°C (the maximum sample 
storage time was 382 days at -70°C). 
Absorption  
In vitro and in vivo data enabled to characterize the absorption of ozanimod after oral administration. 
In  a  validated  Caco-2  monolayer  system,  ozanimod,  at  concentrations  ranging  from  0.0989  μM 
(approximately 1% of the 1 mg clinical dose strength in 250 mL) to approximately 9.89 μM (100%), has 
demonstrated equal or greater permeability relative to minoxidil, classifying ozanimod as a highly cell 
permeable molecule. In addition, stability of ozanimod was also demonstrated in SGF and SIF matrices. 
Therefore,  ozanimod  has  been  classified  as  highly  permeable  and  its  permeability  and  absorption  is 
unlikely to be limited by efflux transporters. 
Following oral administration, the median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of ozanimod 
was approximately 6 to 8 hours (RPCS 001 [SAD/MAD], RPC01-1904 [Hepatic Impairment], RPC01-1906 
[Renal  Impairment],  and  RPC01-1901  [Food  Effect]).  The  median  Tmax  of  CC112273  and  CC1084037 
were approximately 10 hours, and 16 hours, respectively. 
Moreover,  food  (high-  and  low-fat  meals)  intake  did  not  alter  exposure  of  ozanimod,  RP101988,  and 
RP101075  (RPC01-1901  [Food  Effect]).  However,  the  delayed  median  Tmax  observed  for  the  high  fat 
meal when compared to fasting and low-fat conditions might be caused by a delayed gastric emptying, 
as a physiological condition after a high fat stimulus. While data on CC112273 and CC1084037 were not 
available, food is not expected to have an effect on the metabolism or elimination of metabolites since 
food only affects the absorption of the parent drug (e.g., delay gastric emptying, change gastrointestinal 
pH, and physically or chemically interact with a dosage form). In fact, regarding metabolites RP101988 
and  RP101075,  results  from  the  study  show  no  influence  of  both  high  fat  and  low-fat  meals  in  the 
exposure  of  metabolites.  Delayed  Tmax  is  due  to  a  delayed  absorption  of  ozanimod.  Based  on  food 
interaction study, ozanimod can be administered with or without food, as described in the SmPC. 
Following  multiple  dose  administration  of  ozanimod,  the  median  Tmax  of  ozanimod,  CC112273  and 
CC1084037 was approximately 8 to 10 hours, 10 to 12 hours, and 4 to 24 hours, respectively. 
Assessment report

The observed high variability in CC1084037 mean Tmax was not due to the analytical method nor to study 
design, but to normal fluctuations in steady state. 
Based on mass balance study, the Applicant estimated a fraction absorbed of approximately 65%. This 
estimate was derived from the recovered radioactivity in urine 26% and from the recovered radioactivity 
in feces for RP112480, RP112479 and RP101988 metabolites, which together account for 14.77% of the 
radioactive dose. Combining the radioactive dose excreted in urine and hepatic metabolites excreted in 
feces indicated that at least 65% the recovered dose was absorbed (40.77% ÷ 63% of the recovered 
dose). Upon request, the low recovery on total radioactivity (63%) was justified by the Applicant to the 
long t1/2 of metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 and to the loss of 14C-label as carbon dioxide (14CO2) 
in the expired air, due to anaerobic microbial reductive metabolism, which were not covered on mass 
balance study. This justification was found to be plausible by CHMP. Oral bioavailability is however not 
possible to be predicted from mass balance study. Based on results from this study, the profile for the 
cumulative  recovery  of  total  radioactivity,  as  total  radioactive  compounds  concentration,  were 
approximately 10 times higher than the sum of measured radioactive compounds, which was found to 
be  due  to  metabolite  CC112273.  After  long  term  validation,  samples  from  study  RPC01-1909  were 
analysed for this active metabolite and the results showed graphically a similar log-linear terminal phase 
for metabolite CC112273, in comparison to total radioactivity. Therefore, the prolonged t1/2 observed on 
total radioactivity profile was hypothesised to be due to the prolonged t1/2 of metabolite CC112273. 
The absolute and/or relative bioavailability of ozanimod was not estimated in appropriate 
pharmacokinetic studies. 
Considering that the registration/commercial drug product (Formulation 3) uses the same quantitative 
and chemical formulation as the clinical drug product, no bioequivalence study was performed to bridge 
results from the clinical drug product to the registration/commercial drug product.  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of ozanimod and its metabolites (discrete) was assessed in vitro by equilibrium 
dialysis in animal and human plasma  
According study results, ozanimod plasma protein binding was high and ranged from 82.6% to 98.7%. 
In  general,  all  the  active  metabolites  of  ozanimod  are  highly  protein  bound  with  extent  binding 
comparable to ozanimod and the binding was similar across the species tested. 
Based  on  mass  balance  study  and  other  pharmacokinetic  studies,  the  estimated  apparent  volume  of 
distribution (V/F) is very high (>5000L). Despite no intravenous data is available, it is hypnotized that 
high volume of distribution is due to physicochemical properties of the molecule and not due to the low 
bioavailability. A high volume of distribution was also observed in preclinical species. 
From the PK studies it can be concluded that V/F do not variate from single to multiple dose and from 
healthy to patient populations. 
Elimination  
Metabolism 
In  vitro  and  in  vivo  metabolism  studies  have  been  conducted  in  various  species  to  characterize  the 
metabolism of ozanimod. [14C]-ozanimod radiolabel at two distinct positions of the molecule: 5’ (carbon 
between  oxygen  and  nitrogen  of  oxadiazole  ring)  and  3’  (carbon  between  the  two  nitrogens  of  the 
oxadiazole ring) was used to investigate metabolic profiles.

Ozanimod is extensively metabolized in humans to form a number of circulating active metabolites and 
one  circulating  inactive  metabolite  RP101124.  Multiple  enzyme  systems  play  an  important  role  in  the 
metabolism  of  ozanimod  and  no  single  enzyme  system  predominates  the  overall  metabolism  of 
ozanimod.  The  oxidative  pathway  to  formation  of  carboxylate  metabolite  RP101988  is  mediated  by 
ALDH/ADH  while  formation  of  RP101075  by  dealkylation  is  predominantly  carried  out  by  cytochrome 
P450 CYP-3A4. RP101075 is N-acetylated by N-acetyltransferase-2 to form RP101442 or deaminated by 
MAO-B to form the major metabolite CC112273. 
CC112273  is  either  reduced  to  form  CC1084037  or  undergoes  CYP2C8  mediated  oxidation  to  form 
RP101509.  CC1084037  is oxidized  rapidly  to  form  CC112273  by  aldo-keto  reductase  (AKR)  1C1/1C2, 
and/or 3β- and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD). The oxido-reduction interconversion between 
CC112273 and CC1084037 favours CC112273 and there are no direct metabolites of CC1084037 other 
than its metabolism to CC112273 and subsequent elimination via that pathway. Gut microbial flora play 
an  important  role,  in  vivo,  via  anaerobic  reductive  metabolism  of  the  oxadiazole  ring  system  in  the 
formation of many inactive metabolites which constitute a predominant portion of the excreted dose via 
urine and feces. 
CC1084037  is  a  direct  and  inter-converting  metabolite  of  CC112273  and  there  is  no  known  genetic 
polymorphism on the activity of the enzymes involved in the inter-conversion of these metabolites (CBR, 
AKR, and HSD). 
Following  multiple  dosing  of  ozanimod  in  healthy  subjects,  ozanimod,  CC112273,  CC1084037  and 
RP101124  each  represents  approximately  5%,  66%,  13%,  and  10%  of  circulating  total  drug  related 
(active  +  inactive)  exposure,  respectively.  Ozanimod,  CC112273,  and  CC1084037  each  represents 
approximately  6%,  73%,  and  15%  of  circulating  total  active  drug  exposure,  respectively.  Together, 
ozanimod, CC112273, and CC1084037 contribute to approximately 94% of circulating total active drug

exposure. The other active metabolites together contribute to the remaining 6% of circulating total active 
drug exposure. 
Several synonyms have been used for different metabolites during the clinical development. Of special 
importance  when  evaluating  the  metabolism  is  the  fact  that  major  active  metabolite  CC112273  and 
CC1084037 were discovered rather late in the clinical development, when several studies in the clinical 
pharmacology  program  were  already  completed.  The  Applicant  analysed  CC112273  in  seven  Phase  1 
studies. Samples were used that were in the established 17-month long-term stability for CC112273. 
The  overwhelming  majority  of  samples  were  analysed  prospectively  and  only  12.8%  of  total  Phase  1 
samples  were  retrospectively  analysed  for  CC112273.  It  is  unlikely  the  retrospective  analysis  had  a 
significant impact on the overall PK analysis. For CC1084037, no retrospective analysis was performed. 
For metabolite RR112509, there was basically no data provided. 
Aspects of the metabolic pathway were clarified by the Applicant. No new major or minor pathways have 
been  identified  since  the  initial  application.  Inactive  metabolites  found  in  feces  are  expected  to  come 
from unabsorbed parent drug as well as active metabolites, that are excreted via bile. Inactivation of 
ozanimod  and  its  active  metabolites  occur  after  biliary  excretion  by  microbial  gut  flora.  The  inactive 
metabolite RP101124 found in plasma is expected to be absorbed from the gut after being formed by 
microbial flora. Moreover, RP101988 can also be cleared through bile in addition to renal clearance and 
therefore no significant accumulation is expected in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  
Based  on  in  vivo  studies,  the  Applicant  appropriately  characterized  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  main 
ozanimod metabolites CC112273, CC1084037, RP101988, RP101075 and RP101124. 
Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) plays a key role in the formation of major active metabolite CC112273 
and subsequently CC1084037. Different activity of MAO-B could have a significant impact on CC112273, 
and subsequently CC1084037, exposure. Moreover, data from patients who smoke indicates that a lower 
activity of MAO-B due to smoking may have an impact on CC112273 exposure. The clinical relevance of 
this is yet unknown. However, based on scientific literature review, a clinically significant influence on 
metabolite  exposure  by  known  polymorphisms  of  MAO-B  is  highly  unlikely.  Additionally,  a  lack  of 
association between CC112273 and AE of interest (ie, ALT/AST elevation) was observed, as well as a 
lack of correlation between platelet MAO-B activity and plasma CC112273 concentrations. Measurement 
of MAO-B activity is not expected to anticipate or understand the safety and efficacy of ozanimod. 
Excretion 
Based on the urine recoveries as the percent of the administered total radioactivity in the human mass 
balance study (RPC01-1909 [Mass Balance]), the mean fraction of the administered dose excreted in the 
urine  (%CumAe)  was  less  than  0.2%  for  ozanimod  and  RP101075  and  less  than  3%  for  RP101988, 
indicating  that  renal  clearance  is  not  an  important  excretion  pathway  for  ozanimod  or  its  active 
metabolites RP101988 and RP101075. The major inactive metabolite recovered in the urine is RP112402, 
and the major inactive metabolites recovered in the feces are RP112533 and RP112480. 
Ozanimod,  CC112273,  and  RP101075  concentrations  in  urine  were  negligible (ie,  below  threshold  for 
identification), and RP101988 is the only intact oxadiazole recovered in urine with approximately 4% of 
the radioactive dose, indicating that renal clearance is not an important excretion pathway for ozanimod 
or its active metabolites. 
Moreover, based on the available data, it was agreed that there is no evidence for biliary excretion and 
entero-hepatic recirculation. 
Total elimination 
The  average  apparent  oral  clearance  (CL/F)  for  ozanimod  was  3200  mL/min  (192  L/h)  (RPC01-1909 
[Mass Balance]). The mean terminal elimination half-life (T½) values for ozanimod were approximately 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020

19 to 22 hours (RPC01-1901 [Food Effect], RPC01-1909 [Mass Balance], RPC01-1910 [Cardiac Effects 
after  Missed  Doses],  RPC01-1001  [RMS  Intensive  PK/PD],  and  RPC01-1912  [DDI  with  CYP2C8/3A 
Modulators]).  
Steady-state  concentrations  for  ozanimod  were  reached  within  5  to  7  days  of  QD  administration  of 
ozanimod [RPCS 001 [SAD/MAD], RPC01-1905 [Japanese PK Bridging], and RPC01-1910 [Cardiac Effects 
after  Missed  Doses]).  At  steady  state,  approximately  2-fold  drug  accumulation  for  ozanimod  was 
observed.  
Metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 exhibited similar mean t1/2 of approximately 10 days following 
single oral doses in healthy subjects (RPC01-1912 [DDI with CYP2C8/3A Modulators]). The estimated 
mean  T½  of  CC112273  was  approximately  11  days  in  RRMS  patients  following  multiple  dosing.  The 
model-based mean time to steady state for CC112273 was approximately 45 days and with the estimated 
mean  accumulation  ratio  of  approximately  16.  Steady  state  attainment  and  accumulation  ratio  for 
CC1084037 are expected to be similar to CC112273 since both metabolites exhibited similar mean T½ 
(RPC01-1912 [DDI with CYP2C8/3A Modulators]). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Ozanimod demonstrated dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC following a single dose over the 
dose  range  of  0.25  to  3  mg  in  healthy  subjects  across  clinical  pharmacology  studies.  The  active 
metabolites  CC112273  and  CC1084037  also  exhibited  dose-proportional  increases  in  Cmax  and  AUC 
following a single dose over the investigated dose range of 0.25 to 1 mg (for CC112273) and 0.5 to 1 
mg (for CC1084037). Exposure (Cmax and AUC) for CC112273 and CC1084037 were highly correlated 
with or without extrinsic factors (ie, interacting drugs). 
Ozanimod demonstrated dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC following multiple QD doses over 
the  dose  range  of  0.3  to  2  mg  across  clinical  pharmacology  studies.  The  major  active  metabolite 
CC112273 also exhibited dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC following multiple QD doses over 
the dose range of 0.5 to 1 mg across clinical pharmacology studies. Exposure (Cmax and AUC0-last) for 
CC112273 and CC1084037 were highly correlated. 
Time dependency 
The T½ for ozanimod and CC112273 were similar after a single dose or repeated doses. The mean T½ 
value  for  ozanimod  were  approximately  18  to  22  hours  after  single  doses  or  approximately  22  hours 
after multiple doses. The mean T½ for CC112273 was approximately 10 days after single doses and was 
approximately 11 days after chronic dosing. Both CC112273 and CC1084037 exhibited similar T½ after 
single doses and are expected to have similar T½ after chronic dosing. 
After  reaching  steady  state,  PK  parameters  for  ozanimod  did  not  change  with  time  following  chronic 
dosing.  The  trough  concentrations  of  CC112273  at  steady  state  were  also  consistent,  and  results  of 
population PK analysis of CC112273 suggested no systematic changes with time in PK parameters for 
metabolite formation and disposition. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Between-subject variability (%CV) in Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero 
to  24  hours  (AUC0-24)  for  ozanimod,  CC112237  and  CC1084037  following  28-day  dosing  were  similar 
(≤ 35%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 48/188 
 
 
 
In RMS patients, the inter-subject variability (%CV) was estimated for ozanimod CL/F as 23.5% and for 
CC112273 CL/F, apparent volume of distribution in the central compartment (Vc/F) and formation rate 
constant as 74.5%, 25.9% and 37.2%, respectively. 
Based on food effect study data, intra-subject variability of ozanimod was estimated to be low (8-16%). 
Target population 
The Applicant appropriately characterized the pharmacokinetics of ozanimod and its metabolites (except 
RP112273) in RMS patients.  
The PK of ozanimod were not significantly different between healthy subjects and RMS patients. However, 
for CC112273, CL/F was found to be higher in RMS patients compared to healthy subjects, resulting in 
an AUC that was higher by approximately 40% in healthy subjects compared to that in RMS patients 
receiving the same ozanimod dose. Such PK differences for the metabolite with a long T½ were likely 
attributed, in part, to the limitation on ozanimod dosing duration in healthy subjects (≤28 days). 
Special populations 
Hepatic Impairment 
The PK of ozanimod and CC112273 were evaluated in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh class A or B, respectively) and compared to matched subjects with normal hepatic function 
(RPC01-1904 [Hepatic Impairment]). The PK of ozanimod and metabolites were not evaluated in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  administration  of  ozanimod  0.25  mg,  total  (bound  +  unbound)  systemic 
exposures  (ie,  AUC0-last)  for  ozanimod  and  CC112273  in  subjects  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  were 
approximately  11%  lower  and  31%  lower,  respectively,  compared  to  subjects  with  normal  hepatic 
function.  Total  (bound  +  unbound)  systemic  exposures  (ie,  AUC0-last)  for  ozanimod  and  CC112273  in 
subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  were  approximately  27%  higher  and  33%  lower, 
respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Fraction of drug unbound for ozanimod 
and CC112273 were similar between all groups. 
The differences in systemic exposures were considered as not clinically meaningful. While CC1084037 
was not evaluated, results on CC112273 was applicable for CC1084037 since CC1084037 is a direct and 
inter-converting metabolite of CC112273. 
No dosage adjustment is recommended in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Renal Impairment 
The PK of ozanimod and the major active metabolite CC112273 were evaluated in subjects with ESRD 
and  compared  to  matched  subjects  with  normal  renal  function  (RPC01-1906  [Renal  Impairment]). 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  administration  of  0.25  mg  ozanimod,  systemic  exposure  (AUC0-last)  for 
ozanimod and CC112273 in ESRD subjects were approximately 27% higher and 23% lower, respectively, 
compared  to  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  These  differences  were  not  considered  clinically 
meaningful. While CC1084037 was not evaluated, results on CC112273 was applicable for CC1084037 
since CC1084037 is a direct and inter-converting metabolite of CC112273. 
No dosage adjustment is recommended in subjects with impaired renal function. 
Paediatric population 
Ozanimod was not assessed for paediatric patients.

Intrinsic factors 
Gender 
While population PK of ozanimod was not affected by gender, CC112273 steady-state exposure (AUC) 
was  lower  in  males  than  in  females.  The  effect  of  gender  on  CC112273  systemic  exposure  was  not 
deemed clinically meaningful. 
Race 
The effect of race (Japanese) was evaluated in two Phase 1 studies, RPC01-1905 (Japanese PK Bridging) 
and RPC01-1911 (Multiple-dose PK in Japanese and Caucasians). Study RPC01-1905 did not evaluate 
CC112273 while study RPC01 1911 included CC112273 in PK assessments. While CC1084037 was not 
evaluated in these studies, results on CC112273 were applicable for CC1084037 since CC1084037 is a 
direct and inter-converting metabolite of CC112273 and there was no known genetic polymorphism on 
the activity of the enzymes involved in the inter-conversion of these metabolites (CBR, AKR, and HSD). 
In  both  studies,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  PK  of  ozanimod  were  observed  between 
Japanese and Caucasian subjects for the multiple-dose regimens of ozanimod 0.5, 1, and 2 mg QD. In 
study RPC01-1911, no clinically meaningful differences in PK of ozanimod and CC112273 and PD were 
observed between Japanese and Caucasian subjects for multiple-dose regimens of ozanimod 0.5 or 1 
mg QD. 
No dosage adjustment is  recommended in Japanese subjects receiving the multiple-dose regimens of 
ozanimod 0.5 or 1 mg QD. 
Body Weight 
Body  weight  was  studied  as  a  covariate  on  ozanimod  and  main  metabolites  through  population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPK) analysis. It was concluded that body weight had no effect on ozanimod safety 
or efficacy and therefore the effect of body weight on systemic exposures of ozanimod and CC112273 
was not deemed clinically meaningful. 
No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body weight. 
Age 
Age was studied, on the range of 18-55 years in RMS patients, as a covariate on ozanimod and main 
metabolites,  through  popPK  analysis.  It  was  concluded  that  age  did  not  appear  to  have  a  significant 
impact on either safety or efficacy parameters and therefore, the effect of age on ozanimod systemic 
exposure was not deemed clinically meaningful. 
No dose adjustment is recommended based on age in adult patients. Ozanimod was not evaluated in 
elderly patients (>55 years). 
Extrinsic factors 
Smoking status 
A significant effect of smoking on exposure of CC112273 (a metabolism responsible for 73% of overall 
drug activity) was found. Overall the metabolites exposure was reduced up to 50% in smokers compared 
to  non-smokers.  At  request,  the  Applicant  provided  ad  hoc  subgroup  analyses  showing  no  sign  of 
clinically significant differences on efficacy or safety between current smokers and non-current smokers 
(including never smoked, and former smokers) at baseline.

Interactions 
Based  on  the  in  vitro  data  results  regarding  ozanimod  metabolism  and  metabolic  pathways  and 
interactions with transporters, the Applicant appropriately characterized in vivo all the expected possible 
DDI, with ozanimod as victim and as perpetrator. 
All  the  obtained  results  support  the  proposed  wording  for  section  4.5  in  the  SmPC  and  the  warning 
statement on section 4.4 about Concomitant medicinal products 
Inhibitors of the BCRP 
An inhibitor of the BCRP (ciclosporin) doubled the exposure (AUC) of the minor active metabolites may 
subsequently lead to a similar increase in the major active metabolites and increase the risk of adverse 
reactions. The coadministration of BCRP inhibitors (e.g. ciclosporin and eltrombopag) with ozanimod is 
not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Effect of inhibitors of CYP2C8 on ozanimod 
The coadministration of gemfibrozil (a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8) 600 mg twice daily at steady state 
and a single dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg increased exposure (AUC) of the major active metabolites by 
approximately 47% to 69%. Caution should be exercised for concomitant use of ozanimod with strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil, clopidogrel). 
Effect of inducers of CYP2C8 on ozanimod 
The  coadministration  of  rifampin  (a  strong  inducer  of  CYP3A  and  P-gp,  and  a  moderate  inducer  of 
CYP2C8) 600 mg QD at steady state and a single dose of ozanimod 0.92 mg reduced exposure (AUC) of 
major  active  metabolites  by  approximately  60%  via  CYP2C8  induction  which  may  result  in  reduced 
clinical  response.  The  coadministration  of  CYP2C8  inducers  (i.e.,  rifampin)  with  ozanimod  is  not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
Effect of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) on ozanimod 
The  potential  for  clinical  interaction  with  MAO  inhibitors  has  not  been  studied.  However,  the 
coadministration with MAO-B inhibitors may decrease exposure of the major active metabolites and may 
result in reduced clinical response. The coadministration of MAO inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, phenelzine) 
with ozanimod is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Effect of inhibitor of CYP3A on ozanimod 
The coadministration of itraconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp) 200 mg QD at steady-state 
and  a  single  dose  of  Zeposia  0.92  mg  resulted  in  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  exposure  of 
ozanimod, CC112273 and CC1084037. In line with SmPC guidelines, the absence of DDI was not included 
in section 4.5 
Effects of ozanimod on other drugs 
In  vitro,  ozanimod  and  metabolites  did  not  inhibit  nor  induce  activities  of  CYPs  at  clinically  relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, ozanimod coadministration is not expected to alter systemic exposure of CYP 
substrates.  In  vitro,  CC112273  and  CC1084037  inhibited  BCRP  with  an  IC50  of  25nM  and  23nM, 
respectively,  however  they  should  have  no  potential  to  inhibit  BCRP  in  vivo.  In  vitro,  CC112273  and 
CC1084037  inhibited  MAO-B  with  more  than  1000-fold  selectivity  over  MAO-A.  However,  the  use  of 
ozanimod is not expected to interact in vivo with serotonergic and adrenergic agents. 
Effects of ozanimod on oral contraceptives 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 51/188 
 
 
 
 
The  coadministration  of  Zeposia  0.92  mg  QD  and  a  single  dose  of  oral  contraceptive  containing 
ethinylestradiol (EE) 35 mcg and norethisterone (NE) 1 mg resulted in no change in EE or NE exposure. 
Dosing duration of ozanimod was not long enough to attain steady state for the major active metabolites; 
however,  CC112273  and  CC1084037  had  no  in  vitro  effect  on  CYP  enzymes  and  therefore  are  not 
expected to have any effect on EE and NE exposure. 
Effects of ozanimod on MAO activity 
In vitro, CC112273 and CC1084037 inhibited MAO-B with more than 1000-fold selectivity over MAO-A. 
In a clinical study with ozanimod, CC112273 and CC1084037 had no inhibition effect on human platelet 
MAO-B activity.

Report CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1: Data from four Phase 1, one Phase 2, and two Phase 3 clinical studies 
in healthy volunteers and RMS patients were used for this analysis. PopPK analysis was performed using 
NONMEM  version  7.3  and  PsN  version  4.2.0.  Data  exploration,  model  diagnostics,  graph  and  table 
creation  and  data  management  were  performed  using  R  version  3.3.1.  Model  development  was 
performed sequentially (structural model, random effects model, full model, tentative final model, model 
evaluation  /validation  and  final  model).  For  covariate  analysis,  a  stepwise  forward  inclusion  (p=0.01) 
and backward elimination (p=0.001, ∆OFV – 10.84 points) procedure was performed. 
Report Clegene-A2PG-0003: Data from five phase 1 studies in RMS patients (RPC011001), patients with 
hepatic  impairment  (RPC011904),  patients  with  end  stage  renal  disease  (RPC011906),  healthy 
volunteers (RPC011910, RPC011911) were and two phase 3 studies in RMS patients (Study RPC01-201B 
and Study RPC01-301) were used for this analysis. Population PK analysis was performed using NONMEM 
software (Version 7.3), data post-processing was done using SAS, SPlus or R. Graphical analysis was

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Report CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1: For ozanimod interindividual variability (IIV) was low to moderate for 
CL/F, Vc/F, Vp/F, Ka, and D0 (12.2 to 33.1 %CV). Different population values for CL/F were identified 
for studies RPCS001 and RPC01-102 (CL/F=246 L/h) compared to the remaining studies (CL/F=166 L/h). 
Further, body weight and age were identified as covariates explaining some variability in CL/F. 
For the metabolite RP101988, IIV was low for CL/Ffm, Vp/Ffm, and Kam (6.8 to 13.1 %CV). Covariates 
identified were body weight and age on CL/Ffm, and study (RPCS001, RPC01-102, and RPC01-1905) on 
CL/Ffm. 
For the metabolite RP101075, IIV for CL/Ffm was 25.2 %CV and for F1fm 35.4 %CV. Different effects 
on CL/Ffm were found for study RPC01-1905, and studies RPCS001 and RPC01-102. In addition, age on 
CL/Ffm and sex on F1fm were identified.  
Report Clegene-A2PG-0003: For the active metabolite CC112273 IIV were moderate (V2/F=37.2 %CV 
and  K12  =  37.2 %CV)  to  high  (CL/F=74.5 %CV).  The  following  covariates  were  found  on  CL/F:  sex, 
smoking status, mild or moderate hepatic impairment, body weight, total bilirubin, patient status (RMS 
patients). Furthermore, sex, mild or moderate hepatic impairment and body weight were found on V2/F 
and K12. 
CC112273 exposure (AUC0-τ,ss) is predicted to be about 35% lower in males compared to females and 
may be related to higher MAO-B activity in females leading to increased formation of CC112273. Further, 
CC112273 AUC0-τ,ss is predicted to be about 52% lower in current smokers compared to non-smokers, 
possibly due to lower MAO-B activity in smokers compared with non-smokers. A population difference 
(healthy volunteers vs. RMS patients) in CC112273 CL/F was observed with exposures approximately 40 
%  higher  in  healthy  volunteers  compared  to  RMS  patients.  Subjects  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic 
impairment had lower exposure of CC112273 compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, which 
may be explained by the potential for reduced conversion of ozanimod to CC112273.   
Pharmacokinetics in target population  
Report  CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1:  The  model  building  data  set  included  8,936  quantifiable  ozanimod 
concentrations from 1,262 subjects, 8,280 quantifiable RP101988 concentrations from 1,234 subjects 
and 8,024 quantifiable RP101075 concentrations from 1234 subjects. The external evaluation data set 
(Study  RPC01-201B)  included  2,294  quantifiable  ozanimod  concentrations  from  831  subjects,  294 
quantifiable  ozanimod  RP101988  concentrations  from  832  subjects  and  2,272  quantifiable  RP101075 
concentrations from 829 subjects. 
Of  the  model  building  data  set,  184  healthy  volunteers  contributed  4,551,  3,959,  3,847  quantifiable 
concentrations  for  ozanimod,  RP101988  and  RP101075,  respectively,  and  1,083  patients  with  RMS 
contributed 4,385, 4,321 and 4,177 quantifiable concentrations for ozanimod, RP101988 and RP101075, 
respectively. 
The  final  population  PK  model  for  ozanimod  was  a  2-compartment  model  with  zero-  and  first-order 
absorption processes with IIV on CL/F, Vc/F, Vp/F, Ka and D0. Covariates were identified for body weight 
on CL/F, age on CL/F, and study (RPCS001 and RPC01-102) on CL/F. 
The PK model for RP101988 and RP101075 was a two-compartment open model with combined zero- 
and first-order absorption processes, similar to that for ozanimod. 
Using the final PK model, ozanimod CL/F and metabolite CL/Ffm were used to calculate AUCss based on 
the free base amount of ozanimod (adjusted from ozanimod HCl doses by multiply 0.92). For studies 
RPC01-201B and Study RPC01-301 the mean model based predicted exposure at steady-state were 6340

ng*h/L (4593 to 8683 ng*h/L) and 6210 ng*h/L (4209 to 8550 ng*h/L) for 1 mg, respectively. For 0.5 
mg  AUCSS  were  3214  ng*h/L  (2384  to  4265  ng*h/L)  and  3150  ng*h/L  (2190  to  4216  ng*h/L), 
respectively.  Based  on  the  requested  plot  comparing  the  model  predicted  vs.  the  observed  minimal 
concentrations and a table showing the model predicted exposures for the 1 mg QD dosing in phase 3 
RMS  patients,  the  final  model  appeared  to  under-predict  higher,  and  over-predict  the  lower 
concentrations. 
Report  Clegene-A2PG-0003:  A  total  of  1687  of  1898  volunteers  contributed  to  the  PK  analysis  of 
CC112273. Overall, the percentage of BLQ was 5.9 %. For the combined (ozanimod and C112273) PK 
analysis, a total of 12499 ozanimod PK samples from1915 volunteers were included. 
The  final  base  model  was  a  two-compartment  model  with  first-order  formation  rate,  lag  time  for 
formation  and  first-order  elimination.  IIV  was  estimated  for  CL/F,  V2/F  and  formation  rate  constant 
(K12). 
Covariates remaining in the final PK model were sex, current smoker, hepatic impairment, body weight, 
baseline total bilirubin level and RMS patient on CL/F; sex, hepatic impairment and body weight on V2/F; 
and sex, hepatic impairment and body weight on K12. 
Using  the  final  population  PK  model  for  CC112273,  individual  parameters  estimates  were  used  to 
simulate CC112273 concentrations for all subjects in the Phase 3 studies (Study RPC01-201B and Study 
RPC01-301) that were included in the population PK analysis (N=1,492). The dosing regimen was 0.92 
mg  QD  ozanimod  for  1000  days.  PK  profiles  were  simulated  with  frequent  sampling  to  allow  for 
calculation of Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC0-τ,ss (using the trapezoidal rule) on the final day of dosing. Model-
predicted CC112273 PK parameters are summarized in Table 4 for RMS patients in Study RPC01-201B 
and Study RPC01-301 that had ozanimod dose escalated to 0.92 mg (N=754).

Phase  3  studies  (Study  RPC01-201B  and  Study  RPC01-301)  that  were  included  in  the  population  PK 
analysis (N=1,492). Table 5 summarizes the time to steady state (assuming that 90% of the asymptotic

In addition, a combined ozanimod and CC112273 PK model was developed sequentially, however, it the 
model was discontinued at the stage of a working full model. A discrepancy between the two base models 
and the combined model was observed on the estimation of the apparent volume of distribution in the 
central compartment (Vc/F), reflecting the lack of data supporting for the combined PK model to estimate 
Vc/F for ozanimod and CC112273 separately. 
Special populations  
Impaired renal function 
No significant effect of renal function (creatinine clearance) on ozanimod or its three main metabolites 
RP101988, RP1010735, and CC112273 was identified in the population PK analyses as reported in CLG-
Certara-RMS-358-1 and Clegene-A2PG-0003. According to the Applicant position, no dose adjustment is 
needed  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Nevertheless,  since  the  number  of  patients  with  ESRD 
contributing to the analysis was small (n=8), the results should be interpreted with caution.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Hepatic  function  on  clearance  was  evaluated  in  report  CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1  using  alanine 
transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), serum bilirubin and serum albumin. None of these 
parameters was retained in the final PK models for ozanimod, RP101988, or RP1010735. As reported in 
Clegene-A2PG-0003, hepatic impairment had statistically significant effect on CC112273 CL/F (158 % 
increase), V2/F (64.1 % decrease) and K12 (63.1 % slower formation of CC112273). CC112273 exposure 
was lower in volunteers with hepatic impairment. However, the lower exposure seemed not to be clinical 
meaningful and therefore dose adjustments for these patients are not considered necessary according 
to the Applicant´s position. Nevertheless, since only 15 volunteers classified as mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment were included as a combined covariate category in the population PK model development 
for CC112273, the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Gender 
Sex  was  a  significant  covariate  on  the  Fraction  of  metabolite  amount  available  to  enter  the  central 
compartment  (F1fm)  for  the  metabolite  RP101075  (report  CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1).  CC112273 
exposure (AUC0-τ,ss) is predicted to be 35% lower in males compared to females which may be related 
to lower MAO-B activity in males. Given this relatively small difference in CC11273 exposure between 
males and females, coupled with the lack of any clinically meaningful difference in efficacy parameters 
of  ozanimod  1  mg,  it  was  concluded  that  no  dose  adjustments  for  male  patients  are  warranted. 
Accordingly, the subsection regarding gender was removed from section 5.2 of the SmPC.

Race 
Race  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  the  two  population  PK  analyses  CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1  and 
Clegene-A2PG-0003. 
Weight 
Body  weight  was  a  statistically  significant  covariate  on  CL/F  and  CL/Ffm  of  ozanimod  and  RP101988, 
respectively  (Report  CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1).  Further,  body  weight  was  a  statistically  significant 
covariate  on  CL/F,  V2/F,  and  K12  in  the  population  PK  analysis  of  CC112273  (Report  Clegene-A2PG-
0003). However, body weight seemed to have a minimal effect (10% or less) on CC112273 exposure. 
Therefore, given the stable steady-state exposure of the most predominant active metabolite CC112273 
across body weight quartiles, coupled with the lack of any clinically meaningful differences in efficacy 
and  safety  parameters  across  body  weight  quartiles,  no  dose  adjustment  for  body  weight  is 
recommended. 
Elderly 
Age was a significant covariate on the clearance of ozanimod, RP101988, and RP101075 (Report CLG-
Certara-RMS-358-1).  However,  Ozanimod  AUCτ,ss  was  distributed  to  similar  extents,  with  essentially 
the same interquartile ranges, among the age quartiles in each dose group. For CC112273, age was not 
identified as a significant covariate on any of the parameters. Consequently, it is concluded that no dose 
adjustment is necessary based on age over the investigated range of 18-55 years.

A simulation of the PK of ozanimod in paediatrics aged 10 years up to <18 years for the treatment of 
RMS  was  performed  and  is  documented  in  Report  RPC-01-CP-2017-03.  The  primary  objective  of  this 
simulation was to predict the ozanimod doses in paediatrics with RMS aged 10 years up to <18 years 
which would provide similar exposure to the proposed therapeutic dose of 1 mg in adults with RMS. For 
population PK analysis the previously developed PK model as reported in CLG-Certara-RMS-358-1 was 
used. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacological rational for the use of Ozanimod was adequately supported by bibliography and the 
clinical pharmacodynamics is supported by data produced by the Applicant, namely in 16 Phase 1 clinical 
pharmacology studies. PK samples were also collected in Phase 2 study and Phase 3 studies in patients 
with RMS for population PK and E-R analyses. 
Mechanism of action 
Ozanimod HCl is a S1P receptor modulator, which binds with high affinity and selectively to S1P1 and 
S1P5. Ozanimod is 10-fold more selective for S1P1 relative to S1P5 and has little activity on the other 
S1P receptors (S1P2, S1P3, and S1P4). 
Ozanimod  causes  internalization  of  S1P1  and  retention  of  lymphocytes  in  the  lymphoid  tissues,  as 
evidenced by a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count and therefore ameliorating the 
pathological processes through inhibition of lymphocyte migration into the CNS. 
Ozanimod  is  extensively  metabolized  in  humans  to  form  a  number  of  circulating  active  metabolites 
including  two  major  active  metabolites,  CC112273  and  CC1084037,  and  one  circulating  inactive 
metabolite  RP101124.  Following  multiple  dose  administration  of  ozanimod  in  healthy  subjects, 
approximately  94%  of  circulating  total  active  drug  exposure  is  represented  by  ozanimod  (6%),

Page 56/188 
 
 
 
CC112273 (73%), and CC1084037 (15%). The remaining 6% of circulating total active drug exposure 
is represented by other minor active metabolites. 
The relevance of the differences in human S1P selectivity between ozanimod and other S1P modulators 
and  their  implications  for  pharmacodynamics  was  supported  by  a  literature  review  on  the  differential 
effects exhibited by fingolimod and ozanimod on the four S1P receptors in question (S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, 
S1P5).  At  this  moment,  scientific  and  clinical  data  appear  to  support  the  balance  between  mainly 
beneficial effects from S1P1/S1P5 modulation and mainly adverse effects from the S1P3/S1P4 receptors. 
Specifically, evidence appears to suggest that S1P1 agonism might be more related to an acute effect in 
bradycardia induction compared to a S1P3-mediated chronic effect chronic on heart rate and conductivity. 
This might explain, at least in part, the different effect profile of ozanimod in heart conductivity compared 
to  fingolimod.  The  lesser  bradycardic  effect  in  therapy  initiation  of  ozanimod  might  be  related  to  a 
combination of the dose-escalation protocol with the modulation of S1P1 rather than S1P3.  
Primary PD is based mainly in in vitro non-clinical data and an in vivo non-clinical and clinical relations 
with the main biomarker for primary PD, the Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) reduction. 
One of the main outcomes regarding this biomarker came from Study RPC01-1001 where RMS subjects 
received ozanimod 0.5 mg or 1 mg QD for 12 weeks, in which the mean reductions in ALC from baseline 
were approximately 50% and 70% for the 0.5 mg and 1 mg dose groups, respectively. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary Pharmacology 
The ALC reduction from baseline in study RPC01-201 (phase 3) was 45-55% while ALC reduction was 
50-70% in RPC01-1001 (phase 1). At request, the Applicant analysed the relevance of these differences 
which  were  found  to  be  not  significant  due  to  3  main  reasons:  i)  the  reduced  number  of  patients  in 
RPC01-1001 (Phase 1 trial) might have overestimated the relevance of the ALC reduction observed when 
compared to the much larger patient sample in the other trials; ii) the higher baseline values for ALC in 
patients  included  in  RPC01-1001  increased  the  probability  of  achieving  higher  reduction  percentages 
when  compared  to  the  other  trials;  iii)  the  absence  of  differences  in  PK  profiles  for  ozanimod  and 
metabolites between both studies. 
RPC01-1911  investigated  a  supratherapeutic  dose  of  2 mg  in  Japanese  and  Caucasian  subjects.  No 
significant increases above the clinical dose of 1 mg were found further supporting that the dose of 1 mg 
is  in  the  plateau  area  of  the  dose-response  relationship.  Of  note,  there  was  a  clear  difference  in  ALC 
reduction between Japanese and Caucasians on day 28 in the 2 mg group (67% vs. 57%). This might 
have been due to higher CC112273 exposure in Japanese, but the ALC reduction in Caucasians was also 
noticeably weaker than in the FIH study (65% and 68% for 1 mg and 1.5 mg respectively). The Applicant 
provided further data that demonstrated that the differences observed were due to the differences in the 
reporting Day (Day 28 for 2 mg vs. Day 29 for 1 mg and 1.5 mg) and statistical measures (mean value 
for 2 mg vs. median values for 1 mg and 1.5 mg). This data also showed that ALC reduction appeared 
to reach the plateau effect at 1 mg. 
Following  multiple  dosing  for  28  days  in  healthy  subjects,  recovery  of  ALC  into  the  normal  range 
(≥1x 109/L),  but  not  necessarily  to  baseline,  occurred  approximately  3  to  8  days  after  the  last  dose. 
However, recovery of ALC into the normal range was not evident within 7±2 days after the last dose in 
RMS  patients  following  multiple  dosing  for  12  weeks.  Based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  using data 
from controlled and uncontrolled RMS studies (Pool B), the median time to recovery of ALC to the normal 
range (≥1x 109/L) was 30 days after treatment discontinuation in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group.

Ozanimod,  like  S1P  modulators,  leads  to  a  decrease  in  ALC  and  therefore  increases  the  risk  for 
development of diseases that are related to an immunocompromised state. Therefore, considering an 
analogy to S1P modulators SmPC, the inclusion of immunodeficient state (immunodeficiency syndromes, 
patients with increased risk for opportunistic infections, immunocompromised patients including those 
currently  receiving  immunosuppressive  therapies  or  those  immunocompromised  by  prior  therapies), 
severe  active  infections,  active  chronic  infections  (hepatitis,  tuberculosis)  and  active  malignancies  as 
contraindications in section 4.3 was agreed by the Applicant upon request.  
Given the relevance of ALC as biomarker for ozanimod efficacy and safety issues, further characterization 
of the effects of ozanimod on ALC reduction was found to be necessary in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, and 
a reference to suspension of ozanimod therapy in case of an ALC<0.2x109/L was added, along with the 
limit for reintroduction.  
Secondary Pharmacology 
Previous data on S1P receptor modulators supports a potential for heart rate (HR) reduction leading to 
potentially dangerous bradycardia. Also, there was a potential for QT interval prolongation, with severe 
cardiac  arrhythmias  (Torsade  de  Pointes)  as  a  consequence.  Several  studies  regarding  the  effects  of 
ozanimod on cardiac conductivity were performed in order to characterize these effects. 
The implementation of a dose-escalation protocol in the beginning of therapy appeared to attenuate the 
effects on HR observed at higher doses of ozanimod treatment.  
Briefly, introducing a gradual dose escalation of ozanimod over several days with the starting dose of 
0.25  mg  or  0.3  mg  for  4  days  (Days  1  to  4)  followed  by  0.5  mg  for  3  days  (Days  5  to  7) helped  to 
mitigate in the first-dose HR effect in healthy subjects. During dose escalation (0.25 mg Day 1 to Day 
4, and 0.5 mg Day 5 to Day 7) preceding the 1 mg maintenance dose period (Day 8 to Day 28), healthy 
subjects  in  both  placebo  and  ozanimod  groups  demonstrated  HR  reductions.  The  CFPmin  HR  (0  to  12 
hours) ranged from -9.45 to -7.79 bpm for the placebo group and -11.9 to -8.70 bpm for the ozanimod 
group. Predose HR values on Day 5 (0.5 mg) and Day 8 (1 mg) for ozanimod were approximately 5 bpm 
lower than on Day 1 (0.25 mg). The CFPmin HR (0-12 hours) values for ozanimod were similar between 
Days 5 and 8, which were less than on Day 1 by approximately 3 bpm. No effect on HR was evident on 
Day 28 at the maintenance dose of 1 mg. The median time to HRNadir (0 to 12 hours) was similar between 
ozanimod (4.0 hours) and placebo (3.0 to 4.0 hours). Analyses of HR-time profiles and concentration-
HR effect suggested that desensitization of the S1P1 receptor had started occurring by dose escalation 
Day 5. Dosing re-initiation of ozanimod at a 1 mg maintenance dose following drug discontinuation of 
up to 14 consecutive days was not associated with meaningful changes in HR. 
However, caution must be observed in the interpretation of these results. Although bradycardic events 
are attenuated with the dose-escalation protocol, they are not abolished and some patients experienced 
bradycardic events, in the dose-escalation period and beyond (>1%). Bradycardia is still considered as 
a “Common” Adverse Reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC since the incidence of this adverse reaction 
was  found  to  be  marginally  superior  to  1/100.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  further  characterized 
bradyarrhythmia in the warning section 4.4 of SmPC.   
Indeed, the overall incidence of bradycardic events (ie,  preferred terms (PTs) of bradycardia or sinus 
bradycardia) over the course of the treatment period in the controlled Phase 3 studies (Pool A1) was 
1.4%  (12/882)  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg  treatment  group.  The  differences  in  bradycardic  events  were 
mainly driven by differences in Day 1 and that subsequent to Day 1, the incidence of bradycardia was 
similar across the ozanimod 1 mg, ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a treatment groups. These observations 
appeared to be consistent with the dose escalation period along with the putative mechanism for the 
bradycardic effect of ozanimod. Upon request, the Applicant further elaborated on the pharmacodynamic 
profile  of  ozanimod  compared  to  non-selective  S1P  modulators  and  also  explained  the  mechanistic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 58/188 
 
 
 
rational in the apparent reduced bradycardic effect, either related to the dose-escalation protocol or to 
the sub-receptor profile. Activity at S1P1 is associated with first dose sinus bradycardia via activation of 
S1P1-dependent  inwardly-rectifying  potassium  channels  on  cardiac  myocytes.  Following  activation  by 
ozanimod and/or active metabolites, S1P1 is internalized which effectively removes the ability of S1P1 to 
mediate bradycardia. Ozanimod dose escalation regimen gradually increases pharmacokinetic exposure 
of ozanimod and its active metabolites and together with more gradual internalization of S1P1, is believed 
to  underlie  ozanimod’s  reduced  bradycardic  effect  relative  to other  S1P  modulators  in  the  absence of 
dose  escalation.  While  S1P1  is  quickly  internalized  and  no  longer  contributes  to  bradycardia,  it  is  not 
known what the clinical effects of chronic modulation of S1P2 and S1P3 are on the cardiovascular system. 
This information was added to section 5.1 of SmPC as requested by CHMP.  
Regarding the study of QT interval prolongation, a thorough QT (TQT) study conducted to assess whether 
exposure  to  therapeutic  (1  mg)  or  supratherapeutic  (2  mg)  doses  of  ozanimod  in  healthy  subjects 
increased the corrected QT (QTc) interval compared to placebo found no evidence of QTc prolongation 
as demonstrated by the upper boundary of the 95% one-sided confidence interval (CI) that was below 
the 10 ms threshold for both ozanimod 1 and 2 mg QD. 
This initial Phase I study was not sufficient to fully characterize the QT interval prolongation of ozanimod 
due to insufficient duration of treatment leading to insufficient exposure to the major metabolites.  
Concentration-QTc modelling analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of ozanimod, CC112273 
with and without CC1084037 on the QTc interval using concentration data and extensive ECG data from 
two Phase 1 studies, and they did not reveal clinically relevant potential effect of ozanimod treatment 
on QT prolongation. 
A  study  intended  to  characterize  the  cardiac  effects  of  initiating  ozanimod  treatment  in  healthy  adult 
subjects  receiving  steady-state  propranolol  or  diltiazem  did  not  result  in  any  additional  clinically 
meaningful  changes  in  HR  or  interval  from  the  beginning  of  the  P  wave  to  the  beginning  of  the  QRS 
complex (PR interval) compared to either drug alone. Although ozanimod appears to reveal no clinically 
relevant potential of QT interval prolongation, a relationship exists between therapies with bradycardic 
medicines and an increased risk of QT prolongation in patients taking QT prolonging medicines. As further 
clarified in section 4.5 of SmPC, patients on other bradycardic medicinal products and on antiarrhythmic 
medicinal  products  (which  have  been  associated  with  cases  of  torsade’s  de  pointes  in  patients  with 
bradycardia) were not studied with ozanimod. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Although  the  Applicant  has  studied  the  potential  interactions  of  ozanimod  with  some  classes  of 
antihypertensive medications associated with heart rate decrease (propranolol and diltiazem), a number 
of  other  medicines  with  different  mechanism  of  action  could  potentially  have  a  synergistic  effect  that 
might also be of some concern. Study RPC01-1908 (DDI with beta blocker/calcium channel blocker) was 
conducted to characterize the cardiac effects of initiating ozanimod treatment in healthy adult subjects 
receiving steady-state propranolol or diltiazem and did not result in any additional clinically meaningful 
changes in HR or QT interval. 
However,  studies  with  propranolol  and  diltiazem  only  covered  classes  II  and  IV  of  the  antiarrhythmic 
medicines,  and  several  other  antiarrhythmic  medicines  treat  cardiovascular  diseases  that  were  not 
contemplated in the “4.3 Contraindication” section of the SmPC (arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, 
atrial  flutter  and  ventricular  tachycardia  are  a  few  examples).  Several  Na+  channel  blockers  and  K+ 
channel blockers have various indication for treatment of arrhythmias and other cardiovascular diseases 
and can lead to reduced HR: amiodarone and digoxin, for example, are able to prolong QT interval and 
lead to bradycardia. Ivabradine is a heart rate lowering agent, acting by selective and specific inhibition 
of  the  cardiac  pacemaker  If  current  and  is  indicated  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  chronic  stable 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 59/188 
 
 
 
angina pectoris and treatment of chronic heart failure NYHA II to IV class. The proposed ozanimod SmPC 
only contraindicates ozanimod in Class III/IV heart failure.  
Although bradycardic events were attenuated with the dose-escalation protocol, they were not abolished 
and some patients experienced bradycardic events, in the dose-escalation period and beyond, some of 
them considered serious and requiring emergent treatment and concomitant administration of ozanimod 
with known bradycardic medicines might lead to a synergist effect that was not covered by the studies 
performed.  The  absence  of  clinical  studies  regarding  the  safety  of  patients  taking  other  bradycardic 
medicines (amiodarone, digoxin, ivabradine, for instance) in steady-state conditions detailed in section 
4.5 section of SmPC, like those performed with propranolol and diltiazem led to addition of sentences 
regarding  risk  minimization  measures  stated  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  mainly  related  to  first  dose 
monitoring and the seeking of cardiologist advice in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. 
Addition of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases in the 4.3 contraindications section was also performed. 
Besides  the  reference  to  vaccination  in  the  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  cross-reference  to  potential 
interactions  with  ozanimod  in  section  4.5  was  also  performed:  “During  and  for  up  to  3  months  after 
treatment with ozanimod, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines may 
carry a risk of infections and should, therefore, be avoided during and for up to 3 months after treatment 
with ozanimod (see section 4.4)”. 
As ozanimod increases the risk for development of diseases that are related to an immunocompromised 
state,  the  potential  interaction  with  anti-neoplastic,  immunomodulatory  or  non-corticosteroid 
immunosuppressive  therapies  was  also  included  in  section  4.5  of  SmPC  as  follows:  “Anti-neoplastic, 
immunomodulatory  or  non-corticosteroid  immunosuppressive  therapies  should  not  be  coadministered 
due to the risk of additive immune system effects (see sections 4.3 and 4.4)”. 
Pharmacodynamic genetic differences 
No specific pharmacodynamic study was performed to access genetic differences regarding the primary 
pharmacodynamic effect of ozanimod in S1P receptors.  
At  request,  the  Applicant  made  a  review  of  the  scientific  literature  regarding  the  differences  in  S1P 
receptor expression patterns that might depend on genetic differences. That review was mainly focused 
on genetic variations of receptors S1P1 and S1P5, the ones modulated by ozanimod, although the non-
clinical  studies  were  performed  with  fingolimod.  Although  some  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  have 
addressed specific mutations on S1P receptors, it was agreed there is not sufficient and/or consistent 
information to take conclusions regarding their clinical relevance in the therapy with S1P modulators. 
Some  inter-subject  variabilities  regarding  efficacy  and  safety  of  S1P  modulators  might  be  related  to 
differences  in  receptor  expression  and  depending  on  the  receptor’s  sub-type  expression  that  could 
become a relevant marker of efficacy/safety in the treatment of those patients. However, the CHMP also 
agreed that more information is needed regarding genetic variants for that to potentially influence the 
efficacy and safety of ozanimod and other S1P modulators. 
Exposure-effect relationship 
E-R  analyses  for  PD  biomarker  (ALC),  efficacy  (ARR),  and  safety  (hepatic  enzymes  elevation)  were 
performed for both parent ozanimod and its major active metabolite CC112273 to further support the 
B/R assessments for ozanimod. Although E-R analysis did not include CC1084037, E-R data on CC112273 
inform critical assessments related to ozanimod dosing, including the need for dosing adjustments for 
intrinsic or extrinsic factors. 
1.  Report  CLG-Certara-RMS-358-2:  E-R  relationships  of  interest  for  ALC,  ARR,  HR,  and  liver 
aminotransferase (ALT/AST) were characterised for ozanimod.

Exposure-ARR analyses: The response metrics were ALCss, defined as the mean of values after 3 months 
of ozanimod HCl treatment, and patient-level ARR or the number of confirmed relapses during treatment. 
Patient-level  relapse  data was  available  from  2,659 RMS  patients  in  studies  RPC01-201B  and  RPC01-
301. The dataset included 1,732 patients with both ozanimod AUCSS, ALCSS and relapse data. ALCSS and 
relapse data from 885 patients receiving IFN β-1a were also included in the ALVSS-ARR analysis. 
Exposure-ALC model: The response metric was either the minimum value of or the maximum percent 
(%) change from baseline in ALC binned at the time points of 3, 6- and 12-months during treatment. 
The analysis data set included 1,843, 1,858 and 1,807 values for the maximum % change from baseline 
in  ALC  (or  the  minimum  value  of  ALC  with  matched  baseline)  at  3,  6  and  12-month  time  points, 
respectively, from patients with RMS in studies RPC01-201A, RPC01-201B and RPC01-301. Exploratory 
graphical analysis revealed that increasing ozanimod AUCSS were associated with a saturable decrease 
in  ALCSS.  Median  maximum  change  from  ALC  baseline  at  3,  6,  and  12  months  were  -47%,  -50%, 
and -50%, respectively for the 0.5 mg QD dosage. For the 1 mg QD dosage, the maximum changes were 
-60%, -62%, and -63%. The relationship between AUCSS and the maximum change from baseline ALC 
at  3,  6,  and  12  months  were  described  with  a  sigmoidal  Emax (maximum  effect)  model  (f(AUCSSi)  = 
h).  The  typical  maximum  decrease  from  baseline  was  –  25.2%  (at  3 
months), – 26.8% (at 6 months), and – 26.6% (at 12 months). The E-R analysis using steady state ALC

as  the  response  metric  estimated  the  parameters  of  baseline  ALC  and  Emax  consistently  with  the 
longitudinal PK-PD model. Accordingly, this model was used to draw the conclusion on the relationship 
for ozanimod AUC and ALC at steady state. 
In addition, a longitudinal PK-PD model for ALC was developed. The analysis data set comprised 2,722 
ALC values from 226 healthy volunteers in studies RPCS001, RPC01-102, RPC01-1905 and 13621 ALC 
values from 1,915 patients with RMS in studies RPC01-201A, RPC01-201B, RPC01-301 and RPC01-1001. 
A subset of 42 healthy subjects assigned to placebo treatment contributed 574 ALC values to the analysis 
data set. ALC data were described using an indirect response model with inhibitory effect of ozanimod 
on ALC production. The maximum effect of ozanimod concentration on ALC reduction is about 62.6% 
(Emax=0.626, 16.5%CV). 
Exposure-HR  analyses:  The  analysis  data  set  included  158  supine  HR  measurements  with  matched 
baseline  from  healthy  volunteers  in  studies  RPCS001  and  RPC01-102  (of  which  26  subjects  in  study 
RPCS001  received  placebo)  and  1898  supine  HR  measurements  from  patients  with  RMS  in  studies 
RPC01-201A,  RPC01-201B  and  RPC01-301.  Graphical  exploration  revealed  that  HR  decreased  in 
magnitude with increasing Cmax1 in healthy volunteers treated with ozanimod. The minimum HR on day 
1 was described using an inhibitory Emax model as a function of Cmax1 for healthy volunteers only. The 
minimum HR was considered independent of Cmax1 for RMS patients because, due to the different doses 
administered to healthy volunteers compared to RMS patients, the Cmax1 distribution was wider in healthy 
volunteers. The narrow distribution for ozanimod Cmax1 only resulted in a linear model with a slope of -
0.052, which was not significantly different from 0 (p-value of 0.0853). Additionally, the effect on heart 
rate in healthy volunteers receiving placebo was greater than in healthy volunteers receiving 0.25 – 0.5 
mg of ozanimod (13.6% vs. 5.2%). Variability in %-change in HR from baseline was considerably high 
(about  -40%  to  ≥20%).  Moreover,  the  placebo  responses  were  not  consistent  and  thus  comparable 
between the two studies (about -35% to 0% in study RPCS001 vs. -10 to 20% in study RPC01-102). 
For RMS patients, the minimum HR was considered independent of Cmax1. In addition, al longitudinal 
PK-PD model for HR was developed. The analysis data set comprised 2,890 HR values from 157 healthy 
subjects  in  studies  RPCS001  and  RPC01-102  and  29,335  HR  values  from  1,900  patients  with  RMS  in 
studies RPC01-201A, RPC01-201B and RPC01-301. A subset of 26 healthy subjects assigned to placebo 
treatment contributed 336 HR values to the analysis data set. Maximum change in HR was 3.88 bpm 
(75.3%CV).  Further,  IIVs were  identified  for  baseline  HR  (8.37%CV)  and  the amplitude  of  the  cosine 
function (112.2%CV). Relationships for sex and population on HR baseline and baseline observed HR on

Emax  were  identified.  Simulations  showed  that  the  reduction  in  HR  after  0.25  mg  is  less  than  that 
compared with the reduction after administration of higher doses. Median HR nadir (HR nadir) for 0.25, 
0.5, 1 and 3 mg doses were 67, 62, 59, and 54 bpm, respectively. Simulated HR for the initial 7-day 
dose escalation (0.25 mg QD on Days 1 to 4, 0.5 mg QD on Days 5 to 7) followed by either 0.5 mg or 1 
mg QD on Days 8 to 10. During and after the dose escalation period, similar chronotropic effects were 
observed.  
Exposure-ALT/AST model: The response metric was a binary value defined according to the criterion of 
≥ 3 or ≤ 5 times of upper limit of normal values (ULN). There was a total of 2,659 patients with RMS in 
the Phase 3 studies, RPC01-201B and RPC01-301. Of 1,774 patients who received ozanimod HCl, 0.96% 
(n=17)  and  4.6%  (n=82),  respectively,  had  at  least  one  value  of  ALT  and  AST  ≥  3  times  of  ULN, 
respectively.    A  Logistic  regression  model  (logit(p)  =  a  +  bx  where  p  is  the  probability  of  ALT/AST 
elevation, a is an intercept parameter, b is a slope parameter, and x represents ozanimod (AUCss), linking 
ozanimod AUCss and the probability of ALT/AST elevation ≥ 3 or ≤ 5 times of ULN was used. 
2. Report Celgene-A2PG-0004: In this E-R analyses the exposure of ozanimod´s major active metabolite, 
CC112273, to the reduction in ALC (efficacy surrogate endpoint) and to the elevation of hepatic enzymes 
(safety  endpoints)  ALT  and  AST  ≥  3  of  ULN  were  investigated.  Overall,  17,285  ALC  measurements 
following  placebo  and  ozanimod  treatment  from  1,937  volunteers  (healthy  or  RMS  patients)  were 
included  in  the  dataset.  Further,  9,069  quantifiable  CC112273  concentrations  (with  17-month  LTS 
period) from 1,641 volunteers were included data were obtained from studies RPC01-1910, RPC01-1911, 
RPC01-1001, RPC01-201B, and RPC01-301. Reduction on ALC were described by a direct inhibitory Emax 
model with estimated reduction (Emax) of 0.72 (0.649, 0.809). EC50 was estimated to 3540pmol/L (2541, 
4539) (pooled data from healthy volunteers and RMS patients). At request, the Applicant reported that 
for both PK-PD analyses, an inhibitory Emax model was used to characterize the effect of ozanimod or 
CC112273  concentrations  on  ALC.  However,  for  CC112273  the  reduction  on  ALC  was  described  by  a 
direct inhibitory Emax model with estimated reduction (Emax) of 0.72 (0.649, 0.809), while for ozanimod, 
an  indirect  response  model  with  inhibitory  effect  of  ozanimod  on  ALC  production  was  used.  The  E-R 
analysis for ALT and AST was performed using the logistic regression methods with data from the two 
Phase  3  clinical  trials.  Results  suggested  that  the  probability  of  ALT  elevation  ≥  3x  ULN  was  not 
dependent on CC112273 concentration. 
The two doses used in early clinical development and advanced clinical trials (0.5 mg and 1 mg) were 
based  on  the  percentage  of  ALC  reduction  as  the  main  driver  for  clinical  efficacy  and  therefore,  the 
rational for the choice of the 1 mg and 0.5 mg doses as high and low dose in the Phase 2 clinical trials, 
was made according to ALC count results from the Phase 1 study. Upon request, the Applicant clarified 
that study RPCS001 was the first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single 
oral doses of ozanimod 0.3 mg to 3 mg and multiple oral doses 0.3 mg to 2 mg QD for 7 days, 0.3 mg 
to 1.5 mg QD for 28 days, and 2 mg QD for 10 days (preceded by a 7-day dose escalation). The ozanimod 
starting dose (0.3 mg) in this study were selected based on the NOAEL in the toxicology studies. Doses 
during the study were escalated based on the monitoring of dose-limiting toxicity. Results from this study 
showed the median ALC reductions from baseline after 28-day dosing of ozanimod 0.3, 1, and 1.5 mg 
were  approximately  34%,  65%,  and  68%,  respectively,  indicating  that  the  maximal  PD  effect  was 
achieved at the 1 mg dose. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Different  population  PK  models  were  developed  for  ozanimod  and  the  three  main  active  metabolites 
RP101988, RP101075, and CC112273. For ozanimod, body weight and age were identified as covariates 
on CL/F, and different CL/F were identified for the studies RPCS001 and RPC01-102. For CC112273 the 
following  covariates  were  found  on  PK  parameters:  sex,  current  smoker,  hepatic  impairment,  body

weight, baseline total bilirubin level and RMS patient on CL/F; sex, hepatic impairment and body weight 
on  V2/F;  and  sex,  hepatic  impairment  and  body  weight  on  K12.  Overall,  the  usage  of  modelling  and 
simulation techniques in order to gain information on the PK was supported. The modelling strategy was 
considered  acceptable  and  the  models  seemed  to  describe  the  data  sufficiently.  The  appropriate 
information is reflected in the section 5.2 of the SmPC. It should be noted that no PK data was available 
on administration of ozanimod to patients aged 55 years and over and paediatric or adolescent patients 
(<18 years of age) as also included in section 5.2 of SmPC.  
Although  all  relevant  studies  and  PD  aspects  were  approached  by  the  Applicant  in  the  clinical 
pharmacology overview and summary, a few issues needed further discussion in order to clarify relevant 
pharmacodynamic  questions.  Regarding  secondary  pharmacology,  ozanimod  appeared  to  have  more 
limited effects comparing to other S1P modulators, possibly related to a higher specificity to S1P1 and 
S1P5  receptors.  Although  no  QT  prolongation  effect  was  detected  in  the  PD  package  studies  and  the 
bradycardic effects were reduced with the dose-escalation protocol, further clarification was required in 
relation to the potential for synergistic effects with bradycardic medicines other than the ones used in 
the  clinical  pharmacology  studies  and  the  known  exacerbation  of  QT  prolongation  in  patients  taking 
bradycardic medicines. The Applicant agreed to include this clarification in the section 4.5 of the SmPC 
with a dedicated sentence regarding possible interactions with unstudied bradycardic medicines. Upon 
request, the bradycardic effect of ozanimod was further elucidated with the addition of a characterization 
of  the  mechanism  involved  in  bradycardia  and explanation of  a  lesser  bradycardic  effect  of  ozanimod 
compared  with  other  S1P  modulators  in  the  5.1  Pharmacodynamic  properties  section.  A  deeper 
discussion was performed regarding the rational used in the different E-R analysis and the interpretation 
of some results. Also, an explanation of the rational used for the translation/selection of the 1 mg dose 
for Phase I studies was provided by the Applicant. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the clinical pharmacology was very thorough and supported by several Phase I trials along 
with additional data from Phase II and III studies. The modelling strategy was considered acceptable 
and the PK models seemed to describe the data sufficiently. Thus, the PK of ozanimod was considered 
adequately  described.  The  pharmacological  profile  of  ozanimod  was  adequately  documented.  The 
proposed clinical dose of ozanimod 1 mg preceded by 7 days of dose escalation was documented.

2.6.1.  Dose response study 
Study RPC01-201A 
Methodology 
Study setting 
Study RPC01-201A was a Phase 2, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled (Part A) 
and Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 Administered Orally to Relapsing 
Multiple Sclerosis Patients. This study was conducted at 55 study centres in 13 countries. Patients who 
met eligibility criteria as assessed during the 30-day screening period were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 
1  of  2  oral,  daily  doses  of  RPC1063  (0.5  mg  or  1  mg)  or  matching  placebo  for  24  weeks.  The 
randomization  was  stratified  by  country.  Initial  study  treatment  consisted  of  a  7-day  dose  titration 
regimen that consisted of RPC1063 0.25 mg on Days 1 to 4 and RPC1063 0.5 mg on Days 5 to 7. All 
patients were dosed with their assigned treatment level beginning on Day 8. Treatment lasted for 24 
weeks including a 1-week dose titration period. The database lock date was 28 May 2014. 
Eligibility criteria 
Subjects had 1) a documented diagnosis of RMS meeting the revised 2010 McDonald criteria (Polman 
2011) 2) a relapsing clinical course consistent with RMS and history of brain MRI lesions consistent with 
MS,  3)  Ages  18-55  years  4)  an  EDSS  score  between  0  and  5.0  at  baseline,  and  5)  at  least  one 
documented relapse within the last 12 months prior to screening, or at least one documented relapse 
within the last 24 months prior to screening with evidence of at least one GdE T1 brain MRI lesion within 
the last 12 months prior to randomization.  
Outcomes and endpoints 
Brain MRI scans to evaluate number of total GdE and new/enlarging T2 lesions were performed at Week 
0  (baseline),  and  Weeks  8,  12,  16,  20,  and  24.  Other  efficacy  assessments  included  the  EDSS  and 
neurological  examination  (performed  at  the  screening  visit,  Week  12,  and  Week  24),  the  Multiple 
Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) tests (screening, Week 0 
[baseline],  Week  12,  and  Week  24),  and  the  MSQOL-54  (Week  0  [baseline]  and  Week  24).  Safety 
assessments,  including  vital  signs,  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  24-hour  Holter  monitoring,  optical 
coherence  tomography  (OCT),  pulmonary  function  tests  (PFT)  and  clinical  laboratory  measurements, 
were performed at baseline and at scheduled times during the 24-week treatment period. Patients were 
evaluated for relapses and AEs throughout the study. 
Objectives: 
Primary: 
• 
To demonstrate the superior efficacy of RPC1063 compared to placebo by showing a reduction 
in the cumulative number of total GdE lesions from Week 12 to Week 24 in patients with RMS.  
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the proportion of patients who were free of GdE lesions at Week 24 
To  assess  the  effect  of  RPC1063  on  the  cumulative  number  of  new/enlarging  T2  lesions  from 
Week 12 to Week 24 
To  compare  the  clinical  efficacy  of  RPC1063  to  placebo  in  patients  with  RMS  as  assessed  by 
reduction in the ARR and proportion of relapse-free patients at Week 24 
To assess the safety and tolerability of RPC1063 in patients with RMS 
To assess the PK and PD of RPC1063 in patients with RMS. 
Additional clinical exploratory aims: to compare the clinical efficacy of RPC1063 to placebo at Week 24 
as assessed by the EDSS, MSFC, LCLA and MSQOL-54

Statistical Methods: 
The primary endpoint of mean cumulative total number of GdE lesions from Week 12 to Week 24 was 
compared between each RPC1063 treatment group and the placebo group using the stratified Wilcoxon-
Mann-Whitney test, stratified by presence of GdE lesions at baseline (absent or present). As a result of 
performing  the  interim  analysis,  each  comparison  was  assessed  using  a  2-sided  test  at  the 
alpha=0.04944  level  of  significance  in  a  hierarchical  fashion  so  that  the  study-wise  type  I  error  was 
maintained at alpha=0.05. 
A  method  of  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  was  used  for  patients  with  missing  postbaseline 
lesions.  If  a  patient  was  missing  only  1  or  2  consecutive  postbaseline  scans,  then  the  last  valid  non 
missing, postbaseline observation was carried forward to impute the missing value. However, if there 
were no postbaseline values to be carried forward or if the patient was missing more than 2 consecutive 
scans, then the mean number of lesions from patients in the same treatment group at the same visit 
was used as the imputed value (single imputation using mean of visit (MOV)). 
The first sensitivity analysis used a negative binomial regression model to test the mean cumulative total 
number of GdE lesions, adjusting for the baseline number of GdE lesions and region. Since corticosteroids 
may have had a short-term effect on GdE lesions, the second sensitivity analysis excluded MRI scans 
obtained from patients within 24 days of steroid treatment. 
Summary statistics on the number of GdE lesions at baseline and each visit were reported, along with 
the change from baseline and the percent change from baseline. In addition, the proportion of patients 
with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5 GdE lesions at baseline and each visit were reported. 
The key secondary endpoint of number of GdE lesions at Week 24 and number of new or enlarging T2 
hyperintense  lesions  from  Week  12  to  Week  24  were  analysed  using  the  stratified  Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test, stratified by presence of GdE lesions at baseline (absent or present). A sensitivity analysis 
used a negative binomial regression model, adjusted for the baseline number of GdE lesions. 
The proportion of patients who were GdE lesion-free at Week 24 was analysed using Fisher’s exact test. 
The final key secondary endpoint of ARR at the end of Week 24 was analysed using a Poisson regression 
model. The model compared the treatment groups, adjusted for region, the number of relapses within 
24 months prior to the study, and the presence of GdE lesions. A sensitivity analysis used a negative 
binomial  regression  model  to  compare the  ARR  with  the  same  covariates  as  specified  for  the  Poisson 
model. 
Results: 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 258 patients were randomized (placebo, n=88 patients; RPC1063 0.5 mg, n=87; RPC1063 1 
mg, n=83). There were no notable differences among treatment groups. Overall, the majority of patients 
were female (70.2%) and white (98.4% of patients overall), with a mean (SD) age of 38.5 (9.19) years, 
with 54.7% of patients less than or equal to 40 years old. Approximately 90% of patients were enrolled 
in  the  Eastern  European  region  with  Poland  accounting  for 51.2% of  patients.  There  were no notable 
differences among treatment groups for country stratification factors or enrolment by region. Overall, 
the  mean  (SD)  age  at  MS  symptom  onset  was  similar  among  treatment  groups  (31.3  [9.27]  years 
overall). Patients had a mean EDSS of 1.88 at entry and the mean number of relapses in the prior 24 
months was approximately 2 (1.8-2).

• 
The mean cumulative total number of GdE lesions from Week 12 to Week 24 in the intent-to-
treat  population  was  statistically  significantly  reduced  by  86%  in  the  RPC1063  0.5  and  1  mg 
treatment  groups,  as  compared  to  placebo  (both  p<0.0001).  Imputation  was  used  only  in  7 
patients (3 LOCF and 4 MOV). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the primary analyses. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints:

• 
• 
The mean total number of GdE lesions at Week 24 was statistically significantly reduced by 91% 
and  94%  in  the  RPC1063  0.5  and  1  mg  groups,  respectively,  as  compared  to  placebo  (both 
p<0.0001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the primary analyses. 
The  number  of  new  or  enlarging  T2  lesions  from  Week  12  to  Week  24  was  statistically 
significantly  reduced  by  84%  and  91%  in  the  RPC1063  0.5  and  1  mg  treatment  groups, 
respectively,  as  compared  to  placebo  (p<0.0001).  Sensitivity  analyses  confirmed  the  primary 
analyses. 
The  adjusted  ARR  at  Week  24  was  reduced  by  31%  and  53%  in  the  RPC1063  0.5  and  1  mg 
treatment groups, respectively, as compared to placebo (p=0.271 and p=0.053, respectively). 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the primary analyses. 
Clinical exploratory endpoints 
•  Overall,  the  changes  in  EDSS  score,  MSFC  Z-score,  LCLA  score  and  MSQOL-54  score  from 
baseline to Week 24 were not statistically significant between the placebo and RPC1063 1 mg 
treatment groups or between the placebo and RPC1063 0.5 mg treatment groups.  
Conclusion: 
From Study RPC01-201A the two dose levels for ozanimod QD (0.5 mg and 1 mg) were selected for the 
pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
In  the  placebo-controlled  period  of  Study  RPC01-201A,  both  doses  showed  similar  efficacy  for  the 
primary  endpoint  of  the  total  number  of  GdE  brain  MRI  lesions  from  Weeks  12  to  24.  However,  the 
ozanimod 1 mg dose was numerically better than the 0.5 mg dose for new or enlarging hyperintense T2-
weighted brain MRI lesions from Week 12 to Week 24 and for the adjusted ARR at Week 24, with no 
meaningful differences in safety noted. Both doses of ozanimod (1 mg and 0.5 mg) were carried forward 
in the controlled Phase 3 studies to further establish efficacy on the primary endpoint, ARR, as well as 
safety profiles of the 2 doses. 
Data  from  the  Phase  1  study  RPCS  001  provided  evidence  that  the  magnitude  of  the  negative 
chronotropic and adverse conduction effects of S1P modulation was exposure-dependent and could be 
mitigated by gradually increasing exposure. Based on Phase 1 data, a 7-day dose escalation regimen 
was implemented in the Phase 2 study and supported the ability of a dose-escalation regimen to mitigate 
the chronotropic and dromotropic effects of ozanimod. Thus, in order to mitigate potential cardiac effects, 
an initial 7-day dose escalation regimen was used for all subjects in the pivotal studies. The a 7-day dose 
titration regimen consisted of ozanimod 0.25 mg on Days 1 to 4 and ozanimod 0.5 mg on Days 5 to 7. 
Patients allocated to ozanimod 1mg received the first 1mg on day 8.

Controlled, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of RPC1063 Administered Orally to 
Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis Patients.  
Methods 
The pivotal Phase 3 studies of ozanimod in RMS (Study RPC01-301 and Study RPC01-201B) utilized a 
similar study design. Both studies consisted of a 7-day dose-escalation period followed by a randomized, 
double-blind,  double-dummy,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  treatment  period.  The  main  difference 
between the 2 studies was the duration of the treatment period. In Study RPC01-301 (12+ month study), 
the  treatment  period  lasted  until  the  last  enrolled  subject  was  treated  for  12  months,  and  in  Study 
RPC01-201B (24-month study), the treatment period lasted for 24 months.

a Participants randomized to ozanimod received 0.25 mg on Days 1 to 4, 0.5 mg on Days 5 to 7, and 0.5 or 1.0 mg on Day 8 and 
thereafter. 
b The end of treatment occurred when the last active subject received 12 months of treatment with study drug. 
Note: Brain MRIs were performed at Screening, Month 6, and Month 12 for Study RPC01-301, and at Screening, Month 12, and Month 
24 for Study RPC01-201B. EDSS assessments were performed every 3 months in each study. 
Study Participants  
Eligibility  criteria  for  both  controlled  Phase  3  studies  were  similar.  Subjects  had  1)  a  documented 
diagnosis of RMS meeting the revised 2010 McDonald criteria (Polman et al. 2011), 2) a relapsing clinical 
course consistent with RMS and history of brain MRI lesions consistent with MS, 3) ages 18-55 years 4) 
an EDSS score between 0 and 5.0 at baseline, and 5) at least one documented relapse within the last 
12  months  prior  to  screening,  or  at  least  one  documented  relapse  within  the  last  24  months  prior  to 
screening  with  evidence  of  at  least  one  GdE  T1  brain  MRI  lesion  within  the  last  12  months  prior  to

randomization.  Subjects  who  were  MS-treatment  naïve  or  who  had  received  previous  MS  therapies, 
except  for  lymphocyte-depleting  (alemtuzumab,  anti-CD4,  cladribine,  rituximab,  ocrelizumab, 
cyclophosphamide,  mitoxantrone,  total  body  irradiation,  and  bone  marrow  transplant)  and  for 
lymphocyte-trafficking  blockers  (natalizumab, 
fingolimod  or  any  other  S1P1)  were  eligible. 
Documentation of immunocompetence to Varicella zoster or vaccination 30-days prior to baseline was 
required. 
Subjects  were  ineligible  if  they  had  1)  evidence  of  a  relapse  within  30  days  prior  to  screening,  2) 
treatment  with  systemic  corticosteroid  or  adrenocorticotrophic  hormone  within  30  days  prior  to 
screening, 3) disease duration of more than 15 years if EDSS ≤2.0, 4) uveitis, 5) ALC< 800/μL, 6) forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC)<70% of predicted values, 7) resting 
HR< 55 bpm at screening, 8) incompatibility with IFN use (e.g., intolerable side effects), and 9) presence 
of >20 GdE lesions on baseline brain MRI scan. 
Concomitant treatment with medications with a known impact on the cardiac conduction system (e.g., 
beta-blockers,  calcium  channel  blockers,  or  Class  1A  or  Class  3  antiarrhythmics)  were  not  permitted 
during  the  study.  Systemic  corticosteroids  were  not  permitted  during  the  study  except  for  subjects 
experiencing  a  protocol-defined  relapse.  As  per  protocol,  methylprednisolone  1  g  per  day  over  5 
consecutive  days  maximum  was  permitted  as  rescue  medication.  Treatments  were  permitted  for 
symptoms related to MS such as spasticity, incontinence, pain, and fatigue. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of the following 3 regimens for 24 (Study RPC01-201B) 
or 12 (Study RPC01-301) months: 
•  30 μg IFN β-1a IM injection weekly 
•  0.5 mg ozanimod HCl oral capsule daily 
•  1 mg ozanimod HCl oral capsule daily 
Subjects  randomized  to  ozanimod  HCl  1  mg  or  0.5  mg  also  received  weekly  matching  placebo  IM 
injections, and subjects randomized to IFN β-1a 30 μg also received daily matching placebo oral capsules.

Study assessments 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  used  in  the  ozanimod  clinical  studies  including  clinical 
outcomes (ARR and confirmed disability progression (CDP)) and MRI measures of disease activity (new 
or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted and number of GdE brain lesions) are endpoints that have been 
used in recent RMS Phase 3 studies. These endpoints are accepted clinical and radiographic outcomes 
consistent with MS guidelines (CHMP, 2015). 
Disease  activity  assessed  by  MRI  was  conducted  every  6  months  in  Study  RPC01-301  and  every  12 
months in Study RPC01-201B, and at the Early Termination Visit. Assessment of patient disability (EDSS) 
was performed every 3 months in both studies. Functional activity (MSFC and LCLA) and quality of life 
(MSQOL-54) assessments were conducted every 6 months.  
For  each  study,  the  analyses  of  the  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  using  standard  statistical 
approaches according to a pre-specified hierarchical testing procedure.  
ARR was based on confirmed, protocol-defined relapses. A relapse was defined as the occurrence of new 
or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to MS that persisted for >24 hours, was not attributable 
to  confounding  clinical  factors  (e.g.,  fever,  infection,  injury,  and  adverse  reactions  to  concomitant 
medications), and was immediately preceded by a relatively stable or improving neurological state for

≥30  days.  A  clinical  relapse  was  confirmed  by  the  treating  investigator  when  it  was  accompanied  by 
objective neurologic worsening, as measured by a change in EDSS (of at least half a point on the EDSS, 
or  2  points  on  one  of  the  appropriate  Functional  System  [FS]  scores,  or  1  point  on  2  or  more  of  the 
appropriate FS scores), as assessed by the same independent EDSS evaluator blinded to treatment and 
previous  EDSS  assessments.  Further  details  about  relapse  assessment  can  be  found  in  the  blinding 
section.  
Time to first confirmed relapse was an endpoint used to assess treatment effects on relapse frequency, 
and complemented the effects observed in the ARR analysis. 
Number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI Lesions reflects the ‘burden of disease’ 
overall including processes as diverse as oedema, inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss and gliosis 
in MS. T2 lesions have been related to relapses and may accumulate over time. New or enlarging T2 MRI 
lesions are an objective measurement to complement and validate the primary endpoint of ARR. 
Number of GdE Brain MRI Lesions represents the leakage of gadolinium into the perivascular space as a 
result of local breakdown of the blood brain barrier due to inflammation. GdE lesions in MS are associated 
with greater relapse frequency and disability progression. GdE is a sensitive tool for identifying acute 
inflammation because it is transient, persisting for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. 
CDP using EDSS: EDSS is a standardized, widely accepted, numerical scale used to evaluate disability in 
people  with  MS  (Kurtzke,  1983),  according  to  signs  and  symptoms  observed  during  a  standard 
neurological examination. These clinical observations are classified in 7 FS, each of them grading signs 
and symptoms for different neurological functions: pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel or 
bladder, visual, and cerebral. The score ranges from 0.0 (normal exam) to 10.0 (death due to MS). The 
MS disease progression was defined as a sustained worsening in EDSS of 1.0 point or more, confirmed 
after a 3-month and a 6-month period. To confirm that disease progression is sustained, this increase 
had to be present at a visit 3 months later (CDP-3M) and after 6 months (CDP-6M), with all intervening 
EDSS  scores  also  meeting  CDP  criteria  and  excluding  use  of  EDSS  scores  to  confirm  CDP  if  recorded 
during  a  relapse.  The  same  blinded  evaluator  was  to  perform  all  EDSS  assessments  for  an  individual 
subject. Confirmation of MS disease progression must not have occurred at the time of a relapse. If the 
subject was scheduled to be evaluated to confirm disability at the time of a relapse, the disability event 
was assessed at a later visit, which may have been the next scheduled visit, or at an unscheduled visit 
conducted after the relapse resolved. The date of the initial visit at which the minimum increase in the 
EDSS was met was the date of onset of the progression (tentative progression). Disability progression 
could  be  confirmed  at  the  early  withdrawal  visit,  according  to  the  rules  above,  as  long  as  the  early 
withdrawal  visit  was  not  also  a  relapse  assessment  visit.  Death  due  to  MS  was  to  be  counted  as  a 
confirmed progression. If the subject was in the midst of a tentative progression at the time of death, 
the progression date was to be the date of the start of the progression. Otherwise, the progression date 
was to be the date of death. 
Brain Volume Loss: percent changes from baseline in normalized whole-brain, cortical grey matter, and 
thalamic volumes were analysed. 
MSFC  is  a  composite  endpoint  developed  by  the  National  MS  Society  Clinical  Outcomes  Task  Force 
including 1) the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) as ambulatory component (lower extremity function), 2) 
the  9  hole  peg  test  (9HPT)  as  upper  limb  component,  and  3)  the  paced  auditory  serial  addition  test 
(PASAT) as a measure of  executive function cognition that assesses processing speed, flexibility, and 
calculation ability. The PASAT was used as a cognitive component in Study RPC01-201B but was replaced 
with the symbol digit modality test (SDMT) in Study RPC01-301. The SDMT has greater physician and 
patient acceptance compared to PASAT. Both, the PASAT and SDMT are considered valid measures of 
processing  speed,  however  in  contrast  to  the  PASAT,  the  SDMT  does  not  measure  aspects  other  of 
cognitive function. Moreover, the SDMT performance can be influenced e.g. by visual acuity and ocular 
Assessment report

motor functions. Finally, there are practice effects that may hamper the use of SDMT in clinical trials. 
Another  measure  felt  to  be  underrepresented  in  the  EDSS  assessment  is  vision  and  thus  the  study 
included LCLA score, a measure of low-contrast visual acuity validated in MS patients to the MSFC. The 
MSFC  results  were  reported  using  z-scores,  as  prespecified  according  to  the  study  statistical  analysis 
plan (SAP). The MSFC z-score is calculated by creating z-scores for each component of the MSFC. An 
increase in z-score represents improvement. 
MSQOL-54  is  a  validated patient-reported  outcome measure to  assess health-related  quality  of  life  in 
patients  with  MS  (Vickrey,  1995).  The  MSQOL-54  is  a  structured,  self-report  questionnaire  that  the 
patient can generally complete with little or no assistance. It may also be administered by an interviewer. 
Interviewers should be trained in basic interviewing skills and in the use of this instrument. This 54-item 
instrument generates 12 subscales along with 2 summary scores, and 2 additional single-item measures. 
The subscales are physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional 
well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality 
of life, and sexual function. The 2 summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the 
mental health composite summary and are combined to provide scale scores ranging from 0 to 100; a 
higher scale score indicates improved quality of life. The single item measures are satisfaction with sexual 
function  and  change  in  health.  There  is  no  minimally  clinically  important  difference  information  for 
MSQOL-54 specific to MS.  
Sample size 
Assuming extra-Poisson variation (σ2=1.3) (Polman, 2011), a total sample size of 1,059 subjects (353 
per arm) (Nicholas, 2011) provides 80% power to detect a 43% reduction in the ARR (ARR  following 
treatment with IFN β-1a was assumed to be approximately 0.3 [Mikol, 2008]) with α = 0.025. To account 
for an assumed dropout rate of approximately 12%, approximately 1200 subjects (400 per arm) were 
to be enrolled in each controlled Phase 3 clinical study, which was estimated to provide sufficient power 
to meet the primary ARR endpoint within each study. 
Randomisation 
On Day 1, eligible subjects were randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomization 
was stratified by baseline EDSS (≤ 3.5 vs. > 3.5) and country. Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 
to  receive  either  ozanimod  1  mg  QD,  ozanimod  0.5  mg  QD,  or  IFN  β-1a  30  μg  IM  weekly  (approved 
dose)  in  a  double-dummy  manner.  A  dose  escalation  regimen  was  used  for  ozanimod.  IFN  β-1a  was 
selected  as  an  active  control  for  the  ozanimod  controlled  Phase  3  clinical  studies  because  it  is  an 
established,  effective  therapy  for  patients  with  MS  and  offers  meaningful  benefit  in  clinical  and  MRI 
measures of MS disease activity compared to placebo. 
Subjects who completed these studies were eligible to enrol in the open-label extension (OLE) Study, 
RPC01-3001, in which all subjects received ozanimod. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study. Ozanimod and IFN β-1a 
and  their  respective  matching  placebo  capsules/injections  were  identical  in  physical  appearance.  The 
treatment each subject received was not disclosed to the treating investigator, blinded evaluator, study 
center personnel, subject, or sponsor and their representatives. The treatment codes were held according 
to an IRT. Further instructions related to blinding were provided in a separate IRT manual.

A “dual assessor” approach was used to evaluate efficacy and safety to prevent potential unblinding as 
a  result  of  observed  efficacy,  AEs,  or  laboratory  changes.  Each  site  had  at  least  2  investigators:  a 
principal or treating investigator and a blinded evaluator (examining investigator or rater who performed 
EDSS, MSFC, and LCLA assessments). A separate, blinded MSFC assessor, trained in administering the 
MSFC and LCLA, may have been used for the assessment of these instruments. The treating investigator 
and  the  blinded  evaluator  (and  MSFC  assessor,  if  applicable)  were  not  allowed  to  switch  roles  and 
communication between them was restricted. Back-ups for all personnel were to be selected at each site 
in case of absence. However, whenever possible, the blinded evaluator (and MSFC assessor, if applicable) 
were to remain constant for all EDSS, MSFC, and LCLA assessments performed for a given subject. 
The  treating  investigator  was  a  neurologist  experienced  in  the  care  of  patients  with  MS.  The  treating 
investigator  was  responsible  for  the  management  of  the  routine  neurological  care  of  the  subject, 
assessment (including assignment of causality), assessment and treatment of AEs, including suspected 
neurological  worsening  and  MS  relapses,  and  review  of  central  laboratory  results  every  3  months 
throughout  the  study  (except  for  Total  WBC  and  all  differential  WBC  counts  which  were  blinded 
information after the onset of study treatment for the treating investigator and all site personnel) and, 
if necessary, at unscheduled visits between scheduled visits. The treating investigator had access to both 
safety and efficacy data and was to make all treatment decisions based on the subject’s clinical response 
and laboratory findings. The treating investigator did not perform any efficacy assessments.  
The blinded evaluator and MSFC assessor (if applicable) were the efficacy assessor and were neurologists 
or  other  healthcare  practitioners  trained  in  administering  the neurostatus  version  of  the  EDSS,  MSFC 
and  LCLA.  The  EDSS  reviewers  were  Level  C  certified  (the  highest  level)  using  the  neurostatus 
standardized examination and assessment prior to study initiation and examiners were re-certified every 
2 years throughout the conduct of the study. The blinded evaluator could also have performed the MSFC 
and  LCLA,  or  these  may  have  been  performed  by  a  separate,  blinded  MSFC  assessor  trained  in 
administering  the  MSFC  and  LCLA.  The  blinded  evaluator  (and  MSFC  assessor,  if  applicable)  was  not 
involved  with  any  other  aspect  of  the  subject’s  care  and  management  and  remained  blinded  to  AEs, 
concomitant medications, laboratory data, MRI data, treatment assignment, and any other data that had 
the potential for revealing the treatment assignment during EDSS evaluations, which occurred every 3 
months.  The  study  required  the  same  blinded  evaluator(s)  to  perform  all  EDSS  assessments  for  an 
individual subject when possible. The blinded evaluator was responsible for administration of the EDSS 
and did not have access to other data for the subject or to prior EDSS data when performing exams. 
Blinded evaluators and MSFC assessors were to communicate with subjects only as needed to complete 
the  neurologic  examinations  and  to  assess  the  EDSS,  MSFC,  and  LCLA  scores.  There  was  to  be  no 
communication about the subjects between the treating investigator and the blinded evaluator or any 
other information flow about the subjects that could potentially unblind the blinded evaluator. At request, 
the Applicant further clarified that EDSS, MFSC, and LCLA assessments were captured on paper source 
worksheets  by  the  blinded  assessor(s).  The  blinded  EDSS  evaluators  and  MSFC  assessors  were  not 
granted access to the electronic data capture system. The paper source worksheets containing the data 
from the EDSS, MFSC, and LCLA assessments were entered into the electronic data capture system by 
study personnel who did not perform any of these blinded study assessments (e g, study coordinator, 
principal  investigator,  or  alternate  delegate).  This  approach  to  data  handling  helped  ensure  that  the 
EDSS, MFSC, LCLA assessors remained blinded to any data that could have had the potential of revealing 
the  treatment  assignment.  In  addition  to  the  electronic  data  capture  system  access  restrictions,  the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Research Associates verified that the EDSS/MFSC/LCLA assessors remained blinded to 
all subject records during routine onsite monitoring visits.  
At request of CHMP, the Applicant additionally clarified the procedure for confirming potential relapses 
in  the  studies.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  telephone  the  treating  investigator  within  48  hours  of 
symptom onset of a possible relapse. A template questionnaire was provided to treating investigators to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 74/188 
 
 
 
guide in determining whether the symptom onset was in the presence of fever or infection. If fever or 
infection were excluded, an unscheduled relapse assessment including neurological examination, EDSS, 
MSFC and LCLA assessments by the blinded EDSS evaluator was to be scheduled as soon as possible, 
preferably  within  7  days  of  symptom  onset.  Individual  results  from  telephone  questionnaires  and  the 
determination as to whether a relapse assessment visit should or should not have been scheduled were 
not collected in the trials. It was the responsibility of the treating investigator to determine whether a 
relapse assessment should have been scheduled.  As the blinded evaluator responsible for determining 
EDSS  did  not  have  access  to  other  patient  data  or  to  subjects’  prior  EDSS  data  when  performing 
neurological exams, knowledge of the previous EDSS scores should have had none to minimal influence 
on the determination of current EDSS scores. After completion of the relapse assessment, the treating 
investigator  made  the  final  determination  as  to  whether  an  event  represented  a  protocol-defined  (ie, 
confirmed) relapse by evaluating the subject’s neurological signs and symptoms in conjunction with the 
objective EDSS/FSS scores provided by the blinded EDSS evaluator. 
Subjects  were  instructed  not  to  disclose  their  treatment  assignment  or  symptoms  related  to  their 
treatment regimen, and injection sites were to be covered. As flu-like symptoms occur very commonly 
with IFN β-1a 30-μg im, in particular at the beginning of treatment, respective symptoms could have led 
to  de-blinding  of  the  study  treatment.  The  Phase  3  studies  recommended  the  prophylactic  use  of 
acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen (or alternatively, naproxen or aspirin in case a patient could 
not take acetaminophen or ibuprofen) within 1 hour prior to each use of injectable study drug and then 
periodically  thereafter  for  the  24  hours  following  each  injection.  This  recommendation  to  use 
acetaminophen  or  ibuprofen  prophylactically  was  aimed  at  reducing  potential  bias  with  respect  to 
subjects or investigators being potentially unblinded to treatment assignment. 
Central blinded reviewers who had no knowledge of a subject’s treatment or outcome performed MRI 
evaluations. The MRI reading center was also blinded to country, site, and treatment assignment. 
A subject’s treatment assignment was not broken unless medical treatment of that subject depended 
upon knowing the active treatment group. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The statistical  analyses  followed a  modified Intent-to-Treat  (mITT) approach  including  all  randomized 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
The mITT population, which was the primary population for all efficacy analyses, included all randomized 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug grouped according to their randomized treatment, 
regardless of the actual treatment received.  
The  per  protocol  (PP)  Population  was  subset  of  subjects  in  the  mITT  Population  with  high  treatment 
compliance and without any exclusionary protocol deviations 
The  Safety  Population  included  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug. 
Subjects were grouped according to the treatment they received. The Safety Population was the primary 
population for all safety analyses. 
Primary endpoint 
All relapses were to be identified as confirmed or unconfirmed prior to database lock. For each study, 
the primary analysis of ARR (confirmed relapses only) was performed using a Poisson regression model. 
The model compared treatment groups, adjusted for region, age at baseline, and the baseline number 
of  GdE  lesions  with  the  natural  logarithmic  transformation  of  time  on  study  as  an  offset  term  (as  an

approach to handle missing data). The adjusted relapse rates and their associated 95% CIs, the rate 
ratios and their associated 95% CIs, and p-values were reported. Statistical testing included 2 treatment 
comparisons; ozanimod 1 mg group versus the IFN β-1a group and ozanimod 0.5 mg group versus the 
IFN β-1a group (2 treatment contrasts). To account for multiple comparisons, each of the 2 treatment 
comparisons was tested at the alpha=0.025 level. The analysis was repeated in each of the pre-specified 
subgroups. Forest plots showing the rate ratios and 95% CIs for the overall result and the results in each 
subgroup were constructed. 
Two pre-specified sensitivity analyses were to be performed. The first sensitivity analysis was to repeat 
the primary analysis counting both confirmed and unconfirmed relapses. The second sensitivity analysis 
was to use a negative binomial regression model, instead of the Poisson regression model, to compare 
relapse rates. This model was run twice: once repeating the primary analysis (confirmed relapses only) 
and once repeating the first sensitivity analysis (confirmed + unconfirmed relapses). The same covariates 
and offset term were used as specified in the primary analysis.  
In addition to the specified sensitivity analyses, a Kaplan-Meier analysis on the difference in time to first 
confirmed  relapse  curves were  also  performed.  The  estimated  median  time  to  first  confirmed  relapse 
was reported, along with the associated 95% CI and log-rank p-values. 
During the assessment of the procedure, the Applicant was requested to base discussion of results on 
negative  binomial  regression  model  that  better  accounts  for  overdispersion  instead  of  the  Poisson 
regression  model.  As  two  post  hoc  sensitivity  analyses,  the  Applicant  was  also  requested  to  provide 
additional analyses using a treatment policy strategy for the intercurrent event treatment discontinuation 
based  on  the  assumption of  the  absence  of  a  treatment effect  after treatment  discontinuation  and to 
perform a multiple imputation analysis using a jump-to-reference (J2R) approach and a copy-reference 
(CR) approach as more appropriate approaches to handle missing data.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
To control for type 1 error, the three key secondary endpoints were tested in order in a sequential, closed 
hierarchical testing procedure that ranked the 1 mg ozanimod dose above the 0.5 mg ozanimod dose 
and the key secondary endpoints in the following order: 
1.  The number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months or 
over 24 months depending on the study. 
2.  The number of GdE brain MRI lesions at Month 12 or at Month 24 depending on the study. 
3.  Time to onset of disability progression as defined by a sustained worsening in EDSS of 1.0 points 
or more, confirmed after 3 months and after 6 months (both only on pooled data). 
If both doses were significant on the primary endpoint, then the first comparison on the key secondary 
endpoint was between the 1 mg ozanimod group and the IFN β-1a group at the 5% level of significance. 
If that comparison was successful, then the same endpoint was tested for the 0.5 mg ozanimod group 
versus the IFN β-1a group comparison at the 5% level of significance. This procedure was to continue 
down  the  rank  ordered  key  secondary  endpoint  list  until  a  comparison  failed  to  reach  statistical 
significance, after which all subsequent comparisons were considered exploratory. If only 1 ozanimod 
dose was significant on the primary endpoint, then the hierarchical testing procedure was employed on 
the rank ordered key secondary endpoint list for the surviving dose only, at the 2.5% level of significance 
for each key secondary endpoint (Figure 4). For the third key secondary endpoint of time to onset of 
sustained disability  progression,  data  from  Study  RPC01-201B  and  Study  RPC01-301  were  pooled  for 
hypothesis testing.

1. Number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI Lesions 
The  primary  analysis  of  the  number  of  new  or  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  over  12/24  months 
(depending on the study) was performed using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for region, 
age at baseline, and baseline number of GdE lesions, and included the natural log transformation of the

number of available MRI scans as an offset term (as an approach to handle missing data). The rate ratios 
and  their  associated  95%  CIs,  relative  reductions,  and  p-values  were  reported.  The  analysis  was 
repeated in each of the pre-specified subgroups. Forest plots showing the rate ratios and 95% CIs for 
the overall result and the results in each subgroup were constructed. 
Three  sensitivity  analyses  were  initially  performed  to  evaluate  the  leverage  of  missing  data:  the  first 
analysis repeated the primary T2 analysis using the mean number of T2 lesions from subjects from the 
same treatment group to impute missing T2 values (single imputation). The second analysis repeated 
the  primary  T2  analysis  using  LOCF  method  for  imputing  missing  T2  data  values.  Only  data  from 
postbaseline  MRI  scans  were  carried  forward  to the  Month  6  and  Month 12  timepoints  for analysis of 
Study RPC01-301 and to the Month 12 and month 24 timepoints for analysis of the Study RPC01-201B. 
The third analysis repeated the primary T2 analysis using only subjects with complete T2 data at relevant 
MRI visits (observed cases analysis). All 3 sensitivity analyses included the natural log transformation of 
exposure  time  on  study  (instead  of  the number  of available  MRI  scans)  as  the  offset  term.  However, 
during  the  assessment,  the  Applicant  was  requested  to  perform a  post  hoc  sensitivity  analyses  using 
multiple  imputation  analysis  using  both  J2R  and  CR  approaches  as  more  appropriate  approaches  to 
handle missing data.   
2. Number of GdE brain MRI lesions at Month 12 
The analyses of the number of GdE lesions (at Month 12 in Study RPC01-301 and at Month 24 in Study 
RPC01 201B) were performed using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for region, age at 
baseline, and baseline number of GdE lesions, and included the natural logarithmic transformation of the 
number of available MRI scans as an offset term (as an approach to handle missing data). The rate ratios 
and  their  associated  95%  CIs,  relative  reductions,  and  p-values  were  reported.  The  analysis  was 
repeated in each of the pre-specified subgroups. Forest plots showing the rate ratios and 95% CIs for 
the overall result and the results in each subgroup were constructed. 
Three  sensitivity  analyses  were  initially  performed  to  evaluate  the  leverage  of  missing  data:  the  first 
analysis repeated the primary GdE analysis using the mean number of GdE lesions from subjects from 
the  same  treatment  group  to  impute  missing  GdE  values  (single  imputation).  The  second  analysis 
repeated the primary GdE analysis using last LOCF method for imputing missing GdE data values. Only 
data from postbaseline MRI scans were carried forward to the Month 12/24 timepoint for this analysis. 
The  third  analysis  repeated  the  primary  GdE  analysis  using  only  subjects  with  complete  GdE  data  at 
Month 12/24 (observed cases analysis). All sensitivity analyses included the natural log transformation 
of exposure time on study (instead of the number of available MRI scans) as the offset term. Same as 
above,  multiple  imputation  analyses  using  both  J2R  and  CR  approaches  were  requested  during  the 
assessment.  
3. Time to onset of 3-months and 6-months confirmed disability progression 
Based  on  based  on  rates  of  disability  progression  seen  in  other  RMS  studies  with  an  S1P  receptor 
modulator (Cohen, 2010; Kappos, 2010), a pre-specified pooling plan finalized prior to unblinding was 
proposed by the Applicant and agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP and FDA.  
The  primary  analysis  of  time  to  disability  progression  was  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional hazards 
model with factors for treatment group, adjusted for region, age at baseline, and baseline EDSS score. 
Handling of ties was according to Efron. The hazard ratio and associated 95% CIs, and p-values were 
reported.  A  Kaplan-Meier  analysis  on  the  difference  in  time  to  CDP  curves  was  also  performed.  The 
estimated median time to disability progression was reported along with the associated 95% CIs and 
log-rank p-values. Each of these analyses was performed on 3-months and 6-months CDP. 
A subject was censored if follow-up ended before a sustained progression (event) occurred because the 
subject  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study,  the  subject  completed  the  study  (administrative 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 78/188 
 
 
 
censoring) or the subject did not have an event before the cut-off day of data collection for the analysis 
(administrative censoring). The censor date was the date of the last EDSS assessment or date of last 
dose  of  study  drug,  whichever  was  later  for  those  who  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study,  the 
date they completed the study or the cut-off day for the other subjects. Subjects in the mITT population 
who withdrew from the study after the baseline visit but prior to the first clinical evaluation scheduled 
visit were to be censored at entry (left censoring). 
Two different types of sensitivity analyses were performed in the study.  
1.  Analysis to address the robustness of CDP definition for EDSS=0: counting subjects with a baseline 
EDSS=0 as a progression only if the EDSS score increased by at least 1.5 points.  
2.  Analyses to address the random censoring assumption:  
a)  Unconfirmed progressions as confirmed progression event in each analysis (prespecified). 
b)  Premature  study  discontinuations  as  confirmed  progression  events  in  each  analysis 
(prespecified). 
c)  Both unconfirmed progressions and premature discontinuations as progression events in each 
analysis (prespecified). 
d)  Tentative progressions at last EDSS assessment as confirmed progression event in each analyses 
(prespecified). 
e)  Using the OLE Study RPC01-3001 for confirmation of tentative progression in either of the parent 
studies  as  confirmation  of  a  progression  event  (post-hoc).  This  strategy  has  been  used  as 
primary  CDP  analysis  in  another  pivotal  study  (EPAR  Ocrevus  EMA/790835/2017)  (Hauser, 
2017). 
Similarly,  sensitivity  analyses  using  multiple  imputation  analyses  using  both  J2R  and  CR  approaches 
were requested during the assessment. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Brain Volume Loss: percent changes from baseline in normalized brain volume, cortical grey matter, and 
thalamic volume were analysed using the prespecified parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and 
a post hoc nonparametric ANCOVA. Both of these models were adjusted for region and baseline EDSS 
category.  Missing  data  was  handled  using  LOCF.  The  non-parametric  ANCOVA  was  conducted  due  to 
concerns that the distribution of these brain volumes may not follow a normal distribution. Additionally, 
the Applicant was requested to provide a sensitivity analysis based on log-transformed data.  
MSFC: the change from baseline in the MSFC scores and the actual values at each visit were summarized 
in each treatment group using LOCF to address missing data. The changes in MSFC scores at Months 12 
and 24 were analysed and compared between treatment groups using an ANCOVA model adjusting for 
region, EDSS category at baseline, and the baseline MSFC score. 
MSQOL-54  comparisons  of  the  change  from  baseline  to  Month  12  (Study  RPC01-301)  and  Month  24 
(Study  RPC01-201B)  for  the  2  summary  scores  only  between  treatment  groups  were  analysed  by  an 
ANCOVA model adjusted for region, EDSS category at baseline, and baseline summary score of interest. 
Missing data were to be imputed using a mixed-effects regression model (random slope and intercept). 
For the pooled analysis, only descriptive statistics were provided. 
Handling of Missing Data in the pooled analyses 
The  handling  of  missing  data  was  the  same  for the primary  analysis  of  the primary  and  the  first  and 
second  key  secondary  endpoints  as  in  the  individual  studies.  However,  the  sensitivity  analyses  for 
missing  data  in  the  first  and  second  key  secondary  endpoints  were  conducted  slightly  differently  and 
included 1) increasing the visit windows for Months 12 and 24 from the windows specified in the individual 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 79/188 
 
 
 
 
 
SAPs, 2) imputing the treatment group means for missing values as done in the individual studies, and 
3) using the natural logarithm of time on study over 12 and 24 months for Study RPC01-301 and Study 
RPC01-201B, respectively. The approach for handling missing data for the pooled analyses for the third 
key secondary endpoint is explained above.  
Subgroup analyses 
Pre-defined  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  of 
single as well as the pooled phase 3 studies for the following subgroups:   
•  Baseline EDSS score (EDSS ≤3.5 vs. EDSS >3.5). 
•  Baseline presence of Gd-enhancing lesions (present vs. absent). 
• 
Prior treatment status (treatment naïve vs. previously treated). 
•  Age at Baseline (age ≤40 vs. age >40). 
•  Sex (female vs. male). 
•  Race (White vs. non-White). 
•  Weight (< median vs. ≥ median). 
•  Number of relapses in the past 12 months (<2 vs. ≥2) for ARR endpoint only. 
•  Regions  (North  America,  Western  Europe,  South  Africa,  Eastern  Europe).  Due  to  the  small 
number of subjects, North America, Western Europe, and South Africa were combined as Rest 
of World”.  
Post-hoc subgroup analyses:

• 
In  line  with  the  recommendation  of  performing  subgroup  analysis  by  region  provided  in  SA 
(EMEA/H/SA/2779/1/2014/SME/III), the Applicant was requested to further explore B/R balance 
for non-EU and EU population to explore generalizability of results towards an EU population.  
The Applicant also provided subgroup analyses according to other features including number of 
relapses in the past 24 months (0-2 vs. >2), number of T2 lesions (using median as cut-off), 
baseline  EDSS  score  (using  median  2.5  as  cut-off),  prior  use  of  DMT,  change  in  lymphocytes 
(using median as cut-off) and, high disease activity at entry as defined by (1) ≥ 2 relapses in 
the prior 12 months and ≥ 1 baseline GdE lesion, and/or (2) having received ≥ 1 year of DMT in 
the prior 2 years, having the most recent relapse in the previous 12 months while on that DMT, 
and having ≥ 9 baseline hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions or ≥ 1 baseline GdE lesion. 
A 3rd criterion for definition of high disease activity of “Patients with an unchanged or increased 
relapse rate in the year prior to the study (Year -1) as compared to the previous year (Year -2)” 
pre-specified in the SAP for individual studies was not used for subgroup analysis of the pooled 
phase III study data, because this criterion was found to characterize 95% of study population 
in the mITT population, and was therefore not considered to yield new information beyond the 
primary analysis. 
The Applicant was requested to provide subgroup analyses for subjects with and without prior 
IFN β-1a.  
Finally, the was requested to provide all subgroup analyses based on a negative binomial model 
(primary  endpoints)  and  with  and  without  using  J2R  approach  (primary  and  key  secondary 
endpoints) in line with same requests posed by CHMP for main results.  
As  pre-specified  in  the  SAP,  any  subgroup  that  did  not  have  at  least  5%  of  the  overall  sample  size 
(approximately 60 subjects) was not included in subgroup analyses.

Recruitment 
Regarding the periods of recruitment and follow-up, the Applicant reported the following dates: 
•  Study  RPC01-201B:    Date  first  subject,  first  visit:  03  December  2013,  Date  last  subject,  last 
visit: 13 April 2017. Database lock date: 12 May 2017. 
•  Study RPC01-301: Date first subject, first visit: 03 December 2014, Date last subject, last visit: 
22 December 2016, Database lock date: 08 February 2017. 
At request of CHMP, the Applicant provided data on participating/recruiting study centres per country as 
well as on subjects per study that showed no indication that the overall results of the pivotal studies 
were substantially influenced by single study centres. 
Conduct of the study 
Blinding measures 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 82/188 
 
 
 
 
Blinding and particularly the dual assessor approach and the procedure for certification of relapses was 
further clarified at request during the procedure.  
Given that unblinding was understood to influence observers’ impartiality, the procedures for reporting, 
assessing, and confirming relapses were reviewed for any evidence of reporting bias. The proportion of 
relapses that were confirmed by the treating investigator was similar (>90%) across the ozanimod 1 
mg, ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a treatment groups in both Phase 3 studies. 
An additional source of potential unblinding is the different AE-profile of ozanimod compared to the active 
comparator,  IFN  β-1a  in  particular  regarding  flu-like  symptoms.  At  request,  the  Applicant  provided 
subgroup analyses of subjects with or without flu-like symptoms. Additionally, since flu-like symptoms 
were  post-baseline  measurements  influenced  by  treatment,  at  request,  the  Applicant  also  provided  a 
principal strata analysis for the stratum of subjects that would obtain flu-like symptoms under IFN β-1a 
and those who would not obtain flu-like symptoms under IFN β-1a, as well as the corresponding analyses 
regarding the flu-like symptoms obtained under ozanimod. Two different models for the principal stratum 
analysis  (1:1  matching  and  propensity  score  weighting)  were  used  along  with  two  different  analysis 
models (Poisson as pre-specified as the primary analysis and negative binomial modelling). The results 
were rather consistent across the four different analyses showing different effect sizes for subjects with 
flu-like  symptoms  as  compared  to  those  without.  Considering  subjects  that  would  obtain  flu-like 
symptoms  under  IFN  β-1a  as  subjects  for  which  treatment  allocation  (to  IFN  β-1a)  could  have  been 
guessed by the investigator, the difference in the treatment effect size (ARR) between subjects that were 
potentially unblinded and those who were not was approximately 10 %, suggesting an increase from a 
37% reduction to a reported 47% reduction in the effect due to potential unblinding. 
Protocol amendments 
There were protocol amendments to the pivotal Study RPC01-201B to harmonise data so that pooling 
could be performed and to incorporate feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under 
their  Special  Protocol  Assessment  of  both  pivotal  Phase  3  studies,  RPC01-201  and  RPC01-301.  The 
changes  involved  the  reordering  of  secondary  endpoints  and  revisions  to  the  hierarchical  testing 
procedure.  
Protocol compliance and reasons for protocol violations  
86.7% and 93.2% of subjects completed Study RPC01-201B, and Study RPC01-301, respectively  
Across  two  pivotal  phase  3  trials,  eleven  patients’  cases  of  erroneously  dispensed  study  drug  kits 
occurred at single visits and that no more than one case occurred in any study centre. Corrective actions 
included retraining of study sites (described in most cases), review of proper IP dispensing procedures, 
documentation of discrepancies and preparation of corrective action plans. Additionally, three subjects 
were identified as having used the wrong needle size (subcutaneous instead of intramuscular) for the 
administration of IFN β-1a.  
GCP inspections 
A total of 14 investigator site inspections have been conducted by 5 health authorities, namely Moldovan 
Medicine  and  Medical  Devices  Agency,  State  Expert  Center  of  Ministry  of  Health  of  Ukraine,  Federal 
Agency for Medicines and Health Products—Belgium, EMA, and US FDA on dates ranging from 02 Dec 
2015  to  26  Sep  2019.  Of  the  12  reports  available,  one  major  protocol  deviation  was  identified.  This 
apparently did not have an impact on patient’s health or study results. A routine GCP inspection of study 
RPC01-301  has  been  performed  by  EMA,  which  identified  no  critical  and  7  and  4  major  findings, 
respectively across the two investigated sites. Despite these findings, the data reported by these sites 
were still considered to be of sufficient quality to be used for the evaluation of the clinical trial. One US 
FDA inspection is pending results.

Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of subjects were generally well-balanced across treatment groups within 
each Phase 3 study as well as across the studies, with 98.2% of the sample representing subjects with 
RRMS. The majority of subjects were female (66.8% of subjects) and white (98.9% of subjects), with a 
mean age of 35.5 (range 18 to 55 years) and mean BMI of 24.19 kg/m2. The majority of subjects were 
enrolled in the Eastern European region (89.7% of subjects) (Table 8).  
Approximately 70% of the population was DMT-naïve in spite of a mean disease duration> 6 years and 
presence of significant level of inflammatory activity as per inclusion criteria. Active disease was further 
evidenced by the presence of GdE lesions at baseline in 45.0% of subjects with at least 1 GdE lesion, 
including 28.1% of subjects with ≥ 2 GdE lesions. A total of 22.8% of subjects met the definition of a 
highly active MS at baseline as defined as (1) ≥ 2 relapses in the prior 12 months and ≥ 1 baseline GdE 
lesion, and/or (2) having received ≥ 1 year of DMT in the prior 2 years, having the most recent relapse 
in the previous 12 months while on that DMT, and having ≥ 9 baseline hyperintense T2-weighted brain 
MRI lesions or ≥ 1 baseline GdE brain MRI lesion (Table 8).

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy  results  from  the  2  controlled  Phase  3  studies  provide  the  basis  for  the  efficacy  claim  for 
ozanimod. This assessment focused on the most clinically important endpoints: ARR, time to first relapse, 
MRI  endpoints  (GdE  and  T2  brain  lesions,  brain  volume  change),  disability  progression,  MSFC,  and 
MSQOL-54.

The Applicant has used the term “statistically significant” referring to p-values ≤ 0.050 for treatment 
comparisons that were subject to multiplicity adjustment in the hierarchical testing scheme described in 
the  pre-defined  SAP.  The  term  “nominally  significant”  refers  to  p-values  ≤  0.050  for  treatment 
comparisons that were not subject to multiplicity adjustment, either because the treatment comparison 
was not included in the hierarchy or was a post hoc analysis. 
Annualized Relapse Rate and Time to First Relapse 
In both studies, treatment with ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg resulted in statistically significant, clinically 
meaningful reductions in ARR compared with IFN β-1a (Table 10). 
In  Study  RPC01-201B,  the  percent  reduction  in  ARR  compared  to  IFN  β-1a  at  Month  24  was 
approximately  38%  with  ozanimod  1  mg  and  approximately  21%  with  ozanimod  0.5  mg.  In  Study 
RPC01-301, the percent reduction in ARR compared to IFN β-1a at the end of the treatment period was 
approximately 48% and 31%, respectively. A dose-dependent effect was observed favouring the 1 mg 
dose  over  the  0.5  mg  dose  in  both  studies  (Table  10).  In  a  prespecified  analysis  of  pooled  data, 
treatment with ozanimod 1 mg resulted in a 22.2% reduction in ARR relative to ozanimod 0.5 mg.

a  The  endpoint  was  assessed  during  the  treatment  period  for  Study  RPC01-301  and  through  the  end  of  Month  24  for  Study 
RPC01-201B. The primary analysis included confirmed relapses only. 
b  Based on the Poisson regression model, adjusted for region (Eastern Europe vs Rest of the World), age at baseline, and the baseline 
number of GdE lesions, and included the natural log transformation of time on study as an offset term. 
c  The comparison of each ozanimod group vs IFN β-1a group was performed at the 2-sided, 0.025 significance level according to the 
hierarchical statistical testing procedure. 
d  P-value for the comparison between the ozanimod and IFN β-1a treatment groups was based on the log rank test. 
Notes: P-values in bold are considered statistically significant. P-values in italics are considered nominally significant. 
These results were supported by prespecified sensitivity analyses, including confirmed and unconfirmed 
relapses  and  analyses  using  a  negative  binomial  distribution.  It  should  be  noted  that  considering  the 
negative binomial model as the appropriate analysis to account for overdispersion, the 0.5 mg Ozanimod 
dose did not show a significant effect for the primary endpoint in Study RPC01-201B (p=0.0593) (Table

11).  The  sensitivity  analyses  based  on  J2R  and  CR  approach  provided  consistent  treatment  results 
comparing ozanimod to IFN β-1a.  Analyses for PP population were also presented (Table 11). 
Table 11: Sensitivity and PP analyses of the primary endpoint – Study RPC01-201B and 
Study RPC01-301 
Based  on  the  KM  estimate,  subjects  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg  and  0.5  mg  treatment  groups  remained 
relapse-free at a higher rate compared with the IFN β-1a treatment group in both Study RPC01-201B at 
24 months (approximately 76% and 72% versus 64%, respectively) and Study RPC01-301 at 18 months 
(approximately 78% and 77% versus 66%, respectively). The nominal p-values from the log rank test 
for  comparing  the  ozanimod  1  mg  and  0.5  mg  treatment  groups  versus  IFN  β  1a  were  0.0012  and 
0.0702, respectively, for Study RPC01-201B and 0.0002 and 0.0022, respectively, for Study RPC01-301 
(Table 10).  
MRI Measures of Disease Activity 
New or Enlarging Hyperintense T2-Weighted Brain MRI Lesions (1st key secondary endpoint) 
Using  the  results  for  primary  endpoint  derived  from  the  pre-specified  Poisson  regression  model  as 
reference, in both studies, treatment with ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg resulted in statistically significant, 
clinically  meaningful  reductions  in  new  or  enlarging  hyperintense  T2-weighted  brain  MRI  lesions 
compared with IFN β-1a (Table 12).  
In Study RPC01-201B, a statistically significant reduction in the total adjusted mean number of new or 
enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions per scan was demonstrated with ozanimod 1 mg 
(p< 0.0001) and ozanimod 0.5 mg (p=0.0001) compared to IFN β-1a (1.835, 2.092, and 3.183 lesions, 
respectively), corresponding to a 42.4% and 34.3% reduction over 24 months, respectively. In Study 
RPC01-301, a statistically significant reduction in the total adjusted mean number of new or enlarging 
hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions per scan was demonstrated with ozanimod 1 mg (p<0.0001) 
and ozanimod 0.5 mg (p=0.0032), compared to IFN β-1a (1.465, 2.139, and 2.836 lesions, respectively), 
corresponding  to  a  48.3%  and  24.6%  reduction  over  12  months,  respectively.  A  numerical  dose-
dependent effect was observed favouring the 1 mg dose over the 0.5 mg dose in both studies (Table 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 87/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12).  The  sensitivity  analyses  based  on  J2R  and  CR  approach  provided  consistent  treatment  results 
comparing ozanimod to IFN β-1a.   
In a prespecified analysis of pooled data at Month 12 and Study RPC01-201B data at Month 24, treatment 
with ozanimod 1 mg relative to ozanimod 0.5 mg resulted in a 23.5% and 12.3% reduction, respectively, 
in new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions. 
As noted above, the 0.5 mg Ozanimod dose did not show a significant effect for the primary endpoint in 
Study RPC01-201B when considering the preferred the negative binomial model strategy. Consequently, 
results for 0.5 mg Ozanimod should not be considered as statistically significant in Study RPC01-201B.  
Number of Gadolinium-enhancing Brain MRI Lesions (2nd key secondary endpoint) 
In both studies, treatment with ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg resulted in statistically significant, clinically 
meaningful reductions in GdE lesions compared with IFN β-1a (Table 12).  
In Study RPC01-201B, a statistically significant reduction in the adjusted mean number of GdE brain MRI 
lesions was demonstrated with ozanimod 1 mg (p=0.0006) and ozanimod 0.5 mg (p=0.0030) compared 
to  IFN  β-1a  (0.176,  0.197,  and  0.373  lesions,  respectively),  corresponding  to  a  52.9%  and  47.2% 
reduction  at  Month  24,  respectively.  In  Study  RPC01-301,  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the 
adjusted  mean  number  of  GdE  brain  MRI lesions  was  demonstrated  with ozanimod  1  mg  (p<0.0001) 
and ozanimod 0.5 mg (p=0.0182), compared to IFN β-1a (0.160, 0.287, and 0.433 lesions, respectively), 
corresponding to a 63.0% and 33.8% reduction at Month 12, respectively. A numerical dose-dependent 
effect  was  observed  favouring  the  1  mg  dose  over  the  0.5  mg  dose  in  both  studies  (Table  12). The 
sensitivity  analyses  based  on  J2R  and  CR  approach  provided  consistent  treatment  results  comparing 
ozanimod to IFN β-1a.   
In a prespecified analysis of pooled data at Month 12 and Study RPC01-201B data at Month 24, treatment 
with ozanimod 1 mg relative to ozanimod 0.5 mg resulted in a 34.5% and 10.8% reduction, respectively, 
in GdE brain MRI lesions. 
As noted above, the 0.5 mg Ozanimod dose did not show a significant effect for the primary endpoint in 
Study RPC01-201B when considering the preferred the negative binomial model strategy. Consequently, 
results for 0.5 mg Ozanimod should not be considered as statistically significant in Study RPC01-201B 
Percentage of Whole-Brain Volume Change (secondary endpoint) 
Treatment  with  ozanimod  1  mg  and  ozanimod  0.5  mg  resulted  in  nominally  significant  reductions  in 
mean percentage whole brain change compared to IFN β-1a (Table 12). Similar results were obtained 
for  cortical  grey  matter,  and  thalamic  volume  changes.  The  reduction  in  brain  volume  change  was 
observed  by  Month  6  in  both  ozanimod  1  mg  and  0.5  mg  treatment  groups  (nominal  p=0.0145  and 
0.0027,  respectively).  The  requested  sensitivity  analyses  based  on  log-transformed  data  were  in  line 
with primary analyses. The difference in relative change in normalized whole-brain volume corresponded 
to a relative treatment difference of approximately 28% after 12 months of treatment.

numerical 5% and 17.8% relative risk reduction, respectively, for CDP-3M compared to IFN β-1a (Table 
13).  Regarding  CDP-6M  the  HRs  of  1.413  for  1  mg  ozanimod  and  of  1.189  for  ozanimod  0.5  mg 
correspond to a numerical relative risk increase for CDP-6M of 41.3% and 18.9% compared to IFN β-1a 
(Table 13). 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses for CDP-3M were in line with main analyses. Regarding CDP-6M, some 
sensitivity analyses numerically favoured ozanimod over IFN β-1a and vice versa, however, none of the 
comparisons that numerically favoured IFN β-1a were (nominally) statistically significant (Table 13).  
Results from a post-hoc sensitivity analyses including visits of the OLE Study RPC01-3001 (during which 
all subjects received ozanimod 1 mg) were generally more favourable for ozanimod but none of them 
was  significant  (Table  13).  Upon  request,  the  Applicant  presented  absolute  differences  between  the 
ozanimod  1  mg  and  IFN  β-1a  KM  estimates  for  CDP-6M.  According  to  this  analysis,  no  statistically 
significant difference for CDP-6M outcomes was found between both treatment groups, while an approx. 
4% higher CDP-6 rate after 2 years could not be excluded as derived from the lower limit of the 95% CI 
of survival rates (Figure 7).

Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Score 
As supportive results, the Applicant provided MSFC analyses. Unlike the mild (estimates ranging from -
0.022 to -0.067) consistent worsening in the MSFC z-score MSFC (LCLA) z-score with IFN β-1a in the 
individual  studies  and  in  the  pooled  analysis,  subjects  treated  with  ozanimod  had  either  minimal 
worsening or improvement (estimates ranging from -0.010 to +0.036) from baseline compared with IFN 
β-1a (Table 14). In the Study RPC01-201B, results were overall more favourable for ozanimod 0.5 mg 
than for ozanimod 1mg compared to the IFN β-1a group while the opposite trend was shown in Study 
RPC01-301. Nominally significant improvements in MSFC and MSFC (LCLA) z-scores at Month 24 were 
observed  in  the  ozanimod  0.5  mg,  compared  to  the  IFN  β-1a  group  (nominal  p-value  of  0.0246  and 
0.0123, respectively) in Study RPC01-201B (Table 14). Numerically favourable treatment effects were 
seen  with  ozanimod  1  mg,  but  nominal  significance  was  not  achieved.  In  Study  RPC01-301  more

favourable treatment effects were observed for ozanimod 1mg group, but nominal significance was not 
achieved (Table 14).  
These differences between the treatment groups with respect to the z-score composite endpoints were 
primarily driven by the SDMT/PASAT z-score component endpoint. PASAT-3 was used in Study RPC01-
201B  and  SDMT  was  used  in  Study  RPC01-301. In Study  RPC01-201B,  where  PASAT-3  was  used,  no 
significant findings were observed at Month 24 and overall participants of the three groups showed a 
mild improvement on the PASAT-3 performance from baseline (Table 14). In Study RPC01-301 where 
SDMT was used, the mean change from baseline in the SDMT total correct responses at Month 12 were 
1.1, 0.8, and 0.4  for ozanimod 1 mg, ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a, respectively; with nominal p-
values of 0.0016 (ozanimod 1 mg versus IFN β-1a) and 0.0222 (ozanimod 0.5 mg vs. IFN β-1a). In the 
pooled analysis, a statistically significant treatment difference between both dose groups of ozanimod 
and  IFN  β-1a  were  observed  (Table  14).  Comparisons  for  Total  Correct  Responses  were  in  the  same 
direction (Table 14).  
In  a  post  hoc  analysis  in  which  a  change  from  baseline  in  SDMT  of  ≥  4  was  considered  clinically 
meaningful, a numerically greater proportion of subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg treatment 
groups in Study RPC01-301 achieved clinically meaningful improvements in SDMT relative to IFN β-1a 
at  Month  6  (30.0%,  27.5%,  and  22.2%,  respectively)  and  Month  12  (35.6%,  32.1%,  and  27.9%, 
respectively). Additionally, at Month 12, a numerically lower proportion of subjects in the ozanimod 1 
mg  and  0.5  mg  treatment  groups  experienced  a  clinically  meaningful  impairment  in  SDMT  (negative 
change from baseline) compared with IFN β-1a (22.0%, 23.5%, and 28.2%, respectively).

Change in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Summary Scores 
The physical health composite summary score was improved in both ozanimod dose groups compared 
with the IFN β-1a group in the active-controlled Phase 3 studies (Table 15) and in the pooled Month 12 
analysis. In Study RPC01-201B, the difference reached nominal significance for the ozanimod 0.5 mg 
group at 24 months (p=0.0228) but showed only numerical improvement for the ozanimod 1 mg group 
compared  with  IFN  β-1a.  In  Study  RPC01-301,  the  difference  reached  nominal  significance  for  the 
ozanimod  1  mg  group  at  12  months  (p=0.0364)  but  the  difference  for  the  ozanimod  0.5  mg  group 
showed directionally favourable change that did not reach statistical significance.  
For the mental health composite summary score, no apparent differences were observed between the 
ozanimod and IFN β-1a dose groups in the active-controlled Phase 3 studies (Table 15) and in the pooled 
Month 12 analysis.

The efficacy of ozanimod was assessed across multiple sub-populations in prespecified single and pooled 
analyses  of  the  2  controlled  Phase  3  studies  using  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  and  the  three  key 
secondary efficacy endpoints. 
A treatment effect in favour of ozanimod 1 mg versus IFN β-1a was observed for ARR across all subgroups 
analysed (Figure 8) regardless of baseline clinical or MRI disease activity (including those meeting and 
not  meeting  the  criteria  of  highly  active  MS,  see  footnote  for  definition).  A  treatment  effect  was  also 
observed  regardless  of  prior  DMT  use.  The  treatment  effect  favouring  ozanimod  1  mg  was  nominally 
significant in all subgroups where there were sufficient numbers of subjects across treatment groups for 
a meaningful comparison. With ozanimod 0.5 mg, a treatment effect in favour of ozanimod versus IFN 
β-1a was observed across multiple subgroups.  
A treatment effect in favour of ozanimod 1 mg versus IFN β-1a was observed for the number of new or 
enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions over 12 months and over 24 months, and for GdE 
brain MRI lesions at 12 months and at Month 24 across all subgroups analysed, regardless of baseline 
clinical or MRI disease activity. A treatment effect was also observed regardless of prior DMT use. The 
treatment effect favouring ozanimod 1 mg was generally nominally significant in all subgroups where 
there were sufficient numbers of subjects across treatment group for a meaningful comparison of T2 and 
GdE  MRI  brain  lesions.  In  line  with  results  for  ARR,  the  results  for  the  ozanimod  1mg  dose  were 
consistently of greater benefit than the 0.5 mg dose. 
Results for the subgroup analysis for time to onset of CDP showed similar effects with ozanimod and IFN 
β-1a and with the overall population. 
Additional sensitivity subgroup analyses based on a negative binomial model with and without using a 
J2R  approach  for  treatment  discontinuation  produced  rather  consistent  results.  The  only  subgroup 
analyses in which the ARR Ratio was not numerically in favour of 1 mg ozanimod compared to IFN β-1a 
concerned the very small  subgroup of subjects without any prior MS treatment (i.e. also without any 
acute  relapse treatment,  <  10%  of  study  population)  in  Study  RPC01-201B. However,  the  respective 
ARR Ratios were near 1 (1,013 in the worst case). In contrast, the point estimates in this subgroup were 
clearly numerically in favour of ozanimod (0.463 to 0.470) in the respective pooled analyses.

High disease activity defined as (1) ≥ 2 relapses in the prior 12 months and ≥ 1 baseline GdE lesion, and/or (2) having received ≥ 1

Post hoc subgroup analysis evaluating efficacy and safety non-EU and EU populations  
Baseline  characteristics  between  groups  were  similar  being  the  most  remarkable  differences  between 
subgroups the ones in EDSS (2.43 in EU vs. 2.65 in non-EU), duration on study (19 in EU vs. 17 months 
in non-EU) and MS treatment history with DMD (1.5% more in EU than in Non-EU). The magnitude of 
treatment  effects  were  similar  in  both  groups  for  measures  of  focal  inflammatory  activity  (ARR, 
hyperintense T2-weighted and GdE brain MRI lesions). The frequency of Treatment emergent adverse 
event (TEAE) occurring in >5% of the patients was higher in EU population (79.7% in EU vs. 65.1% in 
Non-EU).  
Post hoc subgroup analysis for subjects with and without prior use of INF β-1a 
Subjects  with  prior  interferon  treatment  (including the  active  comparator  Avonex®)  were  allowed  for 
inclusion in the pivotal studies, and approximately 10% of subjects in the pivotal studies had prior IFN 
β-1a. Using Poisson regression model as well as the negative binomial model, a statistically significant 
treatment  effect  was  found  on  ARR  in  both  subgroups.  Both  analysis  methods  revealed  a  difference 
between  both  subgroups  in  favour  of  subjects  with  prior  IFN  β-1a  treatment  (heterogeneity  p-value: 
0.0261 using the negative binomial model and 0.0112 using the Poisson model) (Table 16).

Persistence and Tolerance Effects 
Study RPC01-3001 is an ongoing, multi-site, open-label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the long-
term safety and efficacy of ozanimod in subjects with RMS who completed 1 of the following (parent) 
studies:  RPC01-201A  Extension,  RPC01-201B,  RPC01-301,  or  RPC01-1001  (a  clinical  pharmacology 
study in subjects with MS). All subjects were assigned to ozanimod 1 mg daily.  
As of the data cut-off date of 30 June 2018, 2,495 subjects (84.6% of all subjects randomized in the 
parent studies) had consented to the OLE study, 2323 (93.1%) subjects were ongoing, and 172 (6.9%) 
subjects discontinued the study early. Duration of treatment with ozanimod 1 mg was up to 30 months 
Assessment report

in OLE Study RPC01-3001. There were 398 subjects (52%) with at least 3 years, and 44 subjects (6%) 
with at least 4 years of ozanimod 1 mg treatment throughout the parent and OLE studies combined.  
Open-label treatment with ozanimod 1 mg resulted in a sustained low unadjusted ARR in subjects who 
were already treated with ozanimod 1 mg during the parent studies (0.174 in parent studies and 0.164 
in  OLE)  and led to  decreased  relapse  rates in  subjects  who  switched  from ozanimod  0.5  mg to  1  mg 
(from 0.213 in parent studies to 0.161 in OLE) or from INF β-1a treatment to ozanimod 1 mg (0.285 to 
0.160). A similar pattern was observed for the adjusted ARR, which was 0.153 in the parent studies and 
0.133 in OLE in the 1mg/1mg ozanimod group, changed from 0.184 to 0.131 in the ozanimod 0.5 mg/1 
mg group and changed from 0.246 to 0.126 in the IFN β-1a/ozanimod 1 mg group.  
An additional analysis of ARR on a yearly basis was performed to evaluate the durability of effect  This 
analysis included relapse data until the 5th year of treatment (i.e. year 4-5 in Table 17) collected from 
the Phase 3 parent studies (Study RPC01-301 and Study RPC01-201B) and the OLE (Phase 3 Parent + 
OLE). For the INF β-1a / ozanimod 1 mg and ozanimod 1 mg/ ozanimod 1 mg cohorts, ARR at each time 
interval was analysed while all subjects were uniformly exposed to the ozanimod 1 mg dose. However, 
for the ozanimod 0.5 mg/ ozanimod 1 mg cohort, the ARR analysis is based on subjects being exposed 
to the 0.5 mg dose for the 0 to 1 year time interval, and a mix of ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg for the 1 
to 2 year interval as some subjects from Study RPC01-301 enrolled into the OLE and began receiving 
the  ozanimod  1  mg  dose.  After  2  years,  the  ARR  analysis  for  this  cohort  included  all  subjects  being 
exposed to the ozanimod 1 mg dose as subjects from Study RPC01-201B enrolled into the OLE. 
Table 17: Summary of annualized relapse rate over time during the parent phase III studies 
and open-label extension study – mITT population 
IFN = interferon; ARR = Annualized Relapse Rate; CI = confidence interval; NA = not applicable; NE = Not estimated.  
The reduction in the number of new/enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions and GdE T1 
brain MRI lesions followed a similar pattern to that of the reduction seen in ARR over time.

The proportion of subjects with CDP-3M or CDP-6M continued to be low during OLE Study RPC01-3001. 
The overall proportion of subjects with CDP-3M and CDP-6M during the OLE mITT population were 7.0% 
and  5.1%,  respectively.  Neither  the  median  time  to  CDP-3M  or  CDP-6M,  nor  the  time  to  the  25% 
percentile could be estimated, due to the low event rate.

region (Eastern Europe vs. Rest of World), baseline age, and baseline number of GdE lesions, 
with natural log transformation of time on study as an offset term. 
Comparison of ARRs in each ozanimod groups to IFN at the alpha=0.025 level. 
2#T2/GdE lesions: Based on a negative binomial regression model using observed data, adjusted 
for region (Eastern Europe vs. Rest of the World), age at baseline, and baseline number of GdE 
lesions. The natural log transformation of the number of available MRI scans over 12 months is 
used as an offset term.

Notes 
All analyses based on ITT population 
1Primary efficacy parameter: ARR was analysed using a Poisson regression model adjusted for 
region (Eastern Europe vs Rest of World), baseline age, and baseline number of GdE lesions, with 
natural log transformation of time on study as an offset term. 
Comparison of ARRs in each ozanimod groups to IFN β-1a at the alpha=0.025 level. 
2#T2/GdE lesions: Based on a negative binomial regression model using observed data, adjusted 
for region (Eastern Europe vs. Rest of the World), age at baseline, and baseline number of GdE 
lesions. The natural log transformation of the number of available MRI scans over 12 months is 
used as an offset term. 
³CDP-3M/6M: Based on the Cox proportional hazard model with factors for treatment group,

4Based on ANCOVA, adjusted for region (Eastern Europe vs. Rest of the World), EDSS category per 
IVRS, and the Baseline MSFC score. 
5Post-hoc analysis of BVL (due to non-normal distribution of data) using rank-ANCOVA (and 
observed values) was generally similar to pre-specified analysis (using ANCOVA, shown above), 
however, difference of Ozanimod 5 mg vs. IFN β-1a did not reach nominal statistical significance.

Supportive study 
RPC01-1001: A Phase 1, Multicentre, Randomized, 12-Week, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Multiple-
dose Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of RPC1063 in Patients with RMS. 
Study objectives 
The primary objective was to characterize the PK of ozanimod following multiple-dose administration in 
subjects with RMS. 
The  secondary  objectives  were:  (1)  to  characterize  the  PD  of  ozanimod  following  multiple-dose 
administration in subjects with RMS; (2) to describe the relationship between PK and PD for ozanimod 
in subjects with RMS; and (3) to characterize the safety of ozanimod in subjects with RMS. 
The exploratory objective was to explore additional biomarkers of ozanimod in subjects with RMS. 
Study population, disposition and baseline features 
Twenty-two subjects completed the study. Two subjects in Group 1 (0.5mg) discontinued from the study 
early; 1 withdrew and 1 rolled over into the OLE Study RPC01-3001.  
Overall, demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups [group 1 (0.5mg) 
and group 2 (1mg)] (mean age of approximately 39, mean body weight of approximately 87 kg; 71% 
female; and 75% white). 
Summary of main results: 
Pharmacokinetic Results: 
Median  Tmax  of  ozanimod,  RP101988,  and  RP101075  was  approximately  6  to  8  hours.  Individual 
RP112273  Tmax  values  were  highly  variable,  ranging  from  approximately  0  to  24  hours  and  median 
RP112273 Tmax values also varied between doses and dosing days, ranging from approximately 6 to 10 
hours although a high proportion of the Tmax values occurred at the 24-hour assessment time. The PK 
sampling schedule in this study may not have been optimal to characterize RP112273 Tmax (e.g., no PK 
samples were collected between 10 and 24 hours postdose). 
The intersubject variabilities (CV%) for Cmax,ss and AUCtau,ss on Day 85 ranged from approximately 29% 
to 45% for ozanimod, RP101988, and RP101075. The CV% for RP112273 Cmax,ss and AUCtau,ss on Day 85 
ranged from approximately 40% to 63%. 
On Day 85, the M/P AUCtau,ss ratios for RP112273, RP101988, and RP101075 were approximately 23- to 
39-fold, 1.2- to 1.4-fold, and 0.14- to 0.18-fold, respectively.   
On Day 85, ozanimod, RP112273, RP101988, and RP101075 accounted for approximately 3% to 6%, 
85% to 93%, 4% to 8%, and 0.5% to 0.8%, respectively, of the total agonist exposure. RP112273 is 
therefore the predominant active metabolite of ozanimod. 
The mean t1/2 values for ozanimod, RP101988, and RP101075 were approximately 17 to 25 hours. The 
mean T1/2 for RP112273 was approximately 236 to 308 hours (ie, approximately 10 to 13 days). The PK 
sampling  schedule  in  this  study  may  not  have  been  optimal  to  characterize  RP112273  T1/2  (i.e.,  not 
collected long enough after the last dose to adequately characterize the terminal phase). 
Steady-state concentrations for ozanimod, RP101988, and RP101075 were reached by Day 28 of dosing, 
which was consistent with the observed t1/2 values. RP112273 concentrations appeared to reach steady 
state between Days 28 and 85. The PK sampling schedule (i.e., Trough samples) in this study may not 
have been adequate to discern steady state for RP112273 (ie, no samples between Days 28, 56, and 
85). 
Plasma concentrations of the minor metabolite, RP101442, were not measurable in most subjects.

Pharmacodynamic results: 
During dose escalation, the mean (SD) percent change from baseline in ALC on Days 5 and 8 were similar 
between dose groups. Following dose escalation, dose-dependent reductions in ALC were observed. ALC 
continued to decrease up to Day 56. The mean reductions in ALC from baseline were similar between 
Days 56 and 85, indicating a nadir or plateau effect was reached by Day 56 for both groups. The mean 
reductions in ALC from baseline at nadir were approximately 50% and 70% for the 0.5 and 1 mg dose 
groups, respectively. Additionally, a mean ALC reduction expected to demonstrate a therapeutic effect 
was reached earlier (as early as Day 28) with the 1 mg dose than with the 0.5 mg dose. Following the 
last dose, subject ALC data were highly variable; therefore, the recovery phase of ALC postdose could 
not be adequately characterized. 
Clinical results 
There were no changes from baseline in EDSS score results. 
Safety results:   
No deaths, SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs were reported. 
Six subjects (46.2%) in Group 1 and 10 subjects (90.9%) in Group 2 experienced at least 1 TEAE. The 
TEAEs  that  occurred  in  2  or  more  subjects  overall  included  headache,  pain  in  extremity,  anxiety, 
diarrhoea, seasonal allergy, urinary tract infection, and vitamin D decreased. All but 1 of the TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in severity. One subject in Group 2 had 1 severe TEAE of pain (verbatim term: body 
aches) considered by the investigator to be unlikely related to ozanimod. 
 All  but  1  of  the  TEAEs 
were considered by the investigator to be not related or unlikely related to ozanimod. One subject in 
Group 2 (1 mg) had 1 mild TEAE of ECG T wave amplitude decreased (verbatim term: flattened T waves) 
considered by the investigator to be possibly related to ozanimod. 
No clinically meaningful trends or changes from baseline in laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs (specifically 
no  QTcF  prolongation  or  second-degree  AV  block),  or  Columbia  Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  were 
observed.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  HR  (observed  and  change  from  predose)  observed 
during dose escalation days. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  effects  of  ozanimod  in  subjects  with  RMS  were  studied  in  2  Phase  3,  randomized,  double 
blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multi-center studies (Study RPC01-201B and Study RPC01-301) 
with similar design and efficacy endpoints, but different timepoint for efficacy assessment: 24 months 
on Study RPC01-201B and at least 12 months on Study RPC01-301.  
There were protocol amendments to the pivotal Study RPC01-201B involving the reordering of secondary 
endpoints and revisions to the hierarchical testing procedure. The Applicant’s position that amendments 
did not have repercussion neither on data acquisition nor on study results and discussion was agreed by 
CHMP. Available reports of investigator site inspections including one EMA GCP inspection did not identify 
critical  findings  and  the  major  protocol  deviations  identified  did  not  apparently  have  an  impact  on 
patient’s health or study results. 
The  comparator  (IFN  β-1a  30-μg  IM)  is  probably  the  less  efficacious  and  is  also  difficult  to  tolerate. 
Notwithstanding,  most  DMT  trials  used  it  as  an  active  comparator,  as  therefore,  it  was  considered 
acceptable.

The duration of the pivotal studies was considered rather short, in order to be able to demonstrate a 
beneficial effect regarding CDP in RRMS against an active comparator. This had already been commented 
in the centralised SA, however, only duration of Study RPC01-301 had been (slightly) increased to at 
least 12 months via global study amendment 1 (dated 26 Aug 2014). The relatively short study duration 
of the studies could have had a significant impact on endpoints strongly related to time such as CDP-3M 
and more importantly, CDP-6M. In Study RPC01-301, only patients who experienced a severe relapse 
without complete recovery (tentative disability progression) within the first 6 months would show CDP-
6M by the end of the trial at 12 months. Considering the latency of therapeutic response and duration 
of  studies,  a  very  low  rate  of  progressors  was  expected  in  the  pivotal  studies.  This  may  have  been 
reflected  on  the  variability  of  CDP-3M  among  the  3  treatment  arms  and  lack  of  a  dose-effect  on  this 
measure. 
The patient population is representative of an adult population with RRMS as the majority of subjects 
were female (66.8% of subjects) and white (98.9% of subjects), with a mean age of 35.5 (range 18 to 
55 years) and diagnosed with RRMS (98%). It should be noted neither paediatric nor elderly (>55 years) 
population  were  represented  in  these  studies  according  to  the  eligibility  criteria.  Both  pivotal  studies 
were  conducted  in  approximately  150  recruiting  study  centres  and  the  provided  unadjusted  ARR  per 
study centres and study group, respectively did not indicate, that the overall results of the pivotal studies 
have been substantially influenced by single study centres. The selection of the study centres, favouring 
Eastern Europe, yielded a very high proportion of treatment naïve patients (over 70%), for a population 
with  a  mean  6  years  of  disease  duration  and  active  disease  (99%  had  at  least  one  relapse  in the  12 
months prior the study and approximately half of the population had GdE baseline lesions). This could 
have negatively impacted extrapolability of B/R towards an EU population. In fact, subgroup analysis by 
region was recommended in the centralised SA (EMEA/H/SA/2779/1/2014/SME/III) in order to assess 
the extrapolation of the overall results to the EU population. Upon request, the Applicant further explored 
B/R  in  subgroups  of  EU  and  non-EU  population.  Interestingly,  more  than  expected  EU  patients  were 
treatment naïve, which may be explained by the EU countries who participated in the study and their 
treatment policies. More importantly, differences between EU and non-EU population did not modify the 
B/R  balance  from  the  response  as  compared  between  IFN  β-1a  and  ozanimod.  The  differences  may 
rather reflect the enrolment strategy, easiness of enrolment in some countries (both EU and non-EU) 
and communication of adverse events to the study team rather than significant differences in disease 
epidemiology. 
Regarding baseline disease activity, it should be noted that the included patient population had a rather 
low disease activity with regard to number of relapses prior to inclusion in the study (mean number of 
1.3 in the past year in both studies, mean number of 1.7 (Study RPC01-301) and 1.8 (in Study RPC01-
201B), respectively in the past two years). It is however noted that the proportion of subjects with high 
disease activity as measured by combined relapse and MRI criteria (as specified for subgroup analyses 
of the pooled phase 3 study data) appeared not to be lower in the ozanimod trials compared to trials 
with other S1P receptor modulators (approx. 23% and 18%, respectively). This latter comparison should 
be interpreted with caution, as there are no uniform definitions of high disease activity, and definitions 
varied across trials of different drugs. Disability progression in patients with RRMS is mainly due to lack 
of complete recovery from severe relapses. In this extend, the level of baseline inflammatory activity 
plays a key role on the probability of CDP as an event. 
The  study  was  analysed  using  a  mITT  approach  (all  randomized  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
treatment). Compliance of the study was appropriate as the number of subjects excluded from the PP 
population due to major protocol violations was very low (<1%) in both studies. Across two pivotal phase 
3 trials, 11 patients’ cases of erroneously dispensed study drug kits occurred at single visits and that no 
more than one case occurred in any study centre. These cases were not expected to influence the overall 
efficacy results of both studies to a relevant extent as cases were well distributed across study groups

and  because  of  the  relatively  short  duration  (<1  month)  of  incorrect  IMP  intake  in  all  except  for  two 
cases compared to overall study duration. Additionally, three subjects administered IFN β-1a active drug 
potentially  subcutaneously  at  the  beginning  of  Study  RPC01-201B  due  to  wrong  needle  size,  The 
Applicant  provided  sensitivity  analyses  excluding  these  three  subjects  who  received  potentially 
ineffective IFN β-1a treatment and the results were consistent to the mITT and PP analyses including 
these subjects, when either the primary analysis or the negative binomial model was used.  
The Applicant pre-specified Poisson Regression as main analyses for ARR while Negative Binomial Model 
was preferred by CHMP to deal with overdispersion. These analyses were provided as sensitivity analysis 
and  the  results  were  used  to  decide  which  key  secondary  endpoints  should  be  tested  for  claiming 
statistical  significance  in  the  hierarchical  algorithm.  Similarly,  the  CHMP  requested  the  Applicant  to 
provide sensitivity analyses using methods other than LOCF to better deal with missing data including 
J2R and CR imputation approaches  
For  evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint,  confirmation  of  relapses  was  based  on  EDSS  (the  standard 
assessment  scale  to  evaluate  disability  in  MS),  EDSS  was  further  used  for  confirmation  of  disease 
progression. For evaluation of further secondary endpoints, standard as well as exploratory brain MRI 
parameters, MSQOL-54 as disease specific Quality of life instrument as well as the MSFC as additional 
measurement of disability were used. While the MSFC originally consists of three components (T25FW, 
9HPT and PASAT), the original cognitive component PASAT was replaced by SDMT in Study RPC01-301. 
Further,  LCLA  has  been  added  as  4th  component  to  the  MSFC  in  both  studies  in  order  to  include  an 
evaluation for visual disfunction. The use of these scales as single variable or in combination as secondary 
endpoints  were  accepted.  However,  while  the  SDMT  is  a  valid  measure  of  processing  speed,  the 
correlation between Cognitive Functioning and SDMT score was weak to modest based on the Voice of 
Patient  Study  included  in  for  Qualification  Advice  of  Multiple  sclerosis  clinical  outcome  assessment 
(MSCOA) (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/336445/2019).  
The definition of a confirmed relapse (including the extent of EDSS worsening required) as well as the 
definition of confirmed disability progression (sustained EDSS  worsening ≥ 1  point, confirmed after 3 
months (CDP-3M) and after 6 months (CDP-6M) was largely in line with that applied in other trials in 
RMS. The primary efficacy endpoint (ARR) as well as the secondary endpoints were generally endorsed. 
However,  the  ARR  as  a  relapse-based  primary  endpoint  cannot  be  taken  as  a  surrogate  for  disability 
progression. As the primary endpoint was based on relapse assessment, in line with the Guideline on 
clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products 
for 
the 
treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev.2), progression of disability was evaluated as key secondary endpoint, 
though only as 3rd among the rank ordered key secondary endpoints which were tested in a hierarchical 
procedure. In the centralized SA (EMEA/H/SA/2779/1/2014/SME/III), it was commented that ordering 
of  the  secondary  endpoints  may  be  questioned  as  disability  should  be  the  most  important  secondary 
endpoint.  However,  the  finally  positive  results  of  the  1st  and  2nd  key  secondary  endpoints  did  not 
influence the statistical evaluation of the progression of disability.  
As flu-like symptoms occur very commonly with IFN β-1a, in particular at the beginning of treatment, 
respective symptoms could have led to de-blinding of the study treatment. Prophylactic treatment with 
anti-inflammatory  substances  or  the  analgesic/antipyretic  acetaminophen  before  and  up  to  24  hours 
after every (IFN β-1a or matching placebo) injection, was therefore generally been recommended. Anti-
inflammatory  substances  and  analgesics  were  used  in  a  higher  proportion  of  IFN  β-1a  vs.  ozanimod 
subjects in both studies. It remained unclear, however, how many subjects used these substances as 
prophylactic  or  as  treatment  of  flu-like  symptoms  and  over  which  period  of  time.  In  safety  pool  A1 
(comprising the active controlled phase 3 RMS studies), influenza like illness further occurred in 49.9% 
of IFN β-1a but only in approx. 5% of subjects across both ozanimod dose groups. In order to prevent 
potential de-blinding as a result of the different adverse event profiles or laboratory changes of the study 
treatments, a dual assessor approach was used in both studies which was presented and further clarified

by  the  Applicant  during  the  procedure.  According  to  the  Applicant,  the  prespecified  procedures  for 
maintaining  the  blind  and  the  consistency  of  the  relapse  confirmation  rate  (>90%)  by  the  treating 
investigator  across  treatment  groups  provided  evidence  for  there  being  minimal  bias  in  subjects’ 
reporting  of  relapses  and  in  treating  investigators’  confirmation  of  relapses,  and  therefore  in  the 
determination of ARR. Although, the CHMP considered unfortunate that the treating physician made the 
final  decision  as  to  whether  an  event  represented  a  protocol-defined  (confirmed)  relapse,  the  CHMP 
acknowledged the position of the Applicant. Additionally, it was considered that a potential bias by de-
blinding of the treating physician was still limited based on the following arguments: treating physicians 
were guided by a template questionnaire in determining whether an unscheduled relapse assessment 
(including blinded EDSS evaluation) was to be scheduled when they were informed by the patients of 
onset  of  a  possible  relapse  and  confirmation  of  a  relapse  required  a  pre-specified  worsening  in  EDSS 
score  as  evaluated  by  the  independent  (blinded)  efficacy  investigator.  Additionally,  the  provided  a 
principal strata analysis for the stratum of subjects that would obtain flu-like symptoms under IFN β-1a 
and those who would not obtain flu-like symptoms under IFN β-1a, as well as the corresponding analyses 
regarding the flu-like symptoms obtained under Ozanimod. Although in both, the Flu IFN β-1a stratum 
as  well  as  the  no  flu  IFN  β-1a  stratum  a  reasonable  treatment  effect  was  seen,  the  difference  in  the 
treatment effect (ARR) size between subjects that were potentially unblinded and those who were not 
was approximately 10 %, suggesting an increase from a 37% reduction to a reported 47% reduction in 
the effect due to potential unblinding. Nevertheless, the CHMP agreed the difference between both strata 
may be due to unblinding but may also be due the different populations. Additionally, the effect of 37% 
could still be considered clinically relevant and statistically robust. Finally, some further reassurance was 
considered to be provided by the results of the MRI-derived key secondary endpoints, which were largely 
in  line  with  the  ARR  results,  as  MRIs  were  read  centrally  blinded,  i.e.  by  further  independent  blinded 
readers  which  were  also  locally  separated  from  other  treating/efficacy  investigators.  Overall,  it  was 
agreed  that  although  the  influence  of  unblinding  and  that  of  a  different  population  could  not  be 
disentangled, the real effect might have been smaller without the effect of potential unblinding. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 2,659 subjects were included in the mITT population: 1,313 subjects in Study RPC01-201B 
and  1,346  subjects  in  Study  RPC01-301.  In  these  studies,  86.7%  and  93.2%  of  subjects  completed 
Study  RPC01-201B  and  Study  RPC01-301,  respectively.  These  retention  rates  were  considered 
acceptable.  
Superior efficacy for ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg in clinical and MRI measures of MS disease activity was 
demonstrated in each controlled Phase 3 clinical study relative to the active comparator, IFN β-1a 30-
μg IM. A more evident treatment effect was observed with ozanimod 1 mg compared to ozanimod 0.5 
mg. The key results from the controlled Phase 3 ozanimod clinical studies which were used to qualify 
results in section 5.1 of SmPC were: 
• 
The  primary  endpoint  (ARR)  was  met  for  both  ozanimod  doses  versus  IFN  β-1a  in  each  study 
based  on  a  prespecified  analysis.  This  corresponded  to  a  48.2%  and  37.7%  reduction  with 
ozanimod 1 mg and a 31.2% and 20.9% reduction with ozanimod 0.5 mg, relative to IFN β-1a in 
the  12+  Month  Study  RPC01-301  and  24  Month  Study  RPC01-201B,  respectively.  Consistent 
treatment effects were observed across most sensitivity analyses including J2R and CR approaches 
for  dealing  with  missing  data.  Considering  negative  binomial  regression  as  preferred  model  for 
ARR analysis, Ozanimod 0.5mg did not meet primary endpoint in Study RPC01-201B.  
• 
The first key secondary endpoint, mean number of new/enlarging T2 brain lesions over 12 and 24 
months,  was  met  for  1mg  ozanimod  dose  versus  IFN  β-1a  in  both  pivotal  studies.  The  relative 
reductions in the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions in the 
Assessment report

ozanimod  1  mg  and  ozanimod  0.5  mg  treatment  groups  were  48.3%  and  24.6%,  respectively, 
over  12+  Month  Study  RPC01-301  and  42.4%  and  34.3%,  respectively,  over  24  Month  Study 
RPC01-201B.  Consistent  treatment  effects  were  observed  across  several  sensitivity  analyses 
including J2R and CR approaches for missing data. Considering negative binomial model, ozanimod 
0.5mg did not meet primary endpoint therefore, p-values could only be considered as nominally 
significant for this key secondary endpoint in Study RPC01-201B.  
• 
The second key secondary endpoint, mean number of GdE T1 brain lesions at months 12 and 24, 
was  met  for  both  1mg  ozanimod  dose  versus  IFN  β-1a  in  both  pivotal  studies.  The  relative 
reduction  in  number  of  GdE  T1  brain  MRI  lesions  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg  and  ozanimod  0.5  mg 
treatment groups compared to IFN β-1a were 63.0% and 33.8%, respectively, at 12+ Month Study 
RPC01-301  and  52.9%  and  47.2%,  respectively,  at  24  Month  Study  RPC01-201B.  Consistent 
treatment effects were observed across most sensitivity analyses including J2R and CR approaches 
for  missing  data.  Considering  negative  binomial  model,  ozanimod  0.5mg  did  not  meet  primary 
endpoint  therefore,  p-values  could  only  be  considered  as  nominally  significant  for  this  key 
secondary endpoint in Study RPC01-201B. 
• 
In subgroup analyses of ARR, the number of new or enlarging hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI 
lesions, and the total number of GdE T1 brain MRI lesions, a treatment effect in favour of ozanimod 
1 mg versus IFN β-1a was observed across all subgroups analysed. Of particular relevance was 
the  finding  of  treatment  effect  in  favour  of  ozanimod  1mg  versus  INF  IFN  β-1a  observed  for 
patients with and without highly active RMS.  
•  A low and similar percentage of subjects experienced disability progression in the ozanimod 1 mg, 
ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a treatment groups, with CDP-3M percentages progressed of 7.6%, 
6.5%, and 7.8%, respectively, and CDP-6M percentages progressed of 5.8%, 4.8%, and 4.0%, 
respectively. In the prespecified pooled analysis, the risk of CDP-3M with both ozanimod 1 mg and 
0.5 mg were similar to IFN β-1a (HR of 0.950 and 0.822, respectively). Regarding CDP-6M, the 
HRs versus IFN β-1a were 1.413 for 1 mg ozanimod and of 1.189 for ozanimod 0.5 mg 
The magnitude of effect for the primary endpoint (ARR) and MRI key secondary endpoints was clinically 
relevant.  During  the  treatment  period  for  Study  RPC01-301,  compared  with  IFN  β-1a,  both  doses  of 
ozanimod led to a statistically significant reduction in ARR of 48.2% for the 1 mg dose (p<0.0001) and 
31.2% for the 0.5 mg (p=0.0013). A greater relative reduction was observed with the ozanimod 1 mg 
dose  and  results  from  PP  and  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  were  highly  consistent  with  primary 
analyses. Through the end of Month 24 for Study RPC01-201B, a dose response was also seen. However, 
considering the negative binomial model as the appropriate analysis to account for overdispersion, the 
0.5 mg dose did not show a significant effect for the primary endpoint in Study RPC01-201B (p=0.0593) 
as nominally statistically significant differences to IFN β-1a for the 0.5mg dose were only reached in the 
analyses  using  the  Poisson  regression  model  (including  PP  analyses).  Nevertheless,  results  of  the  PP 
analyses as well as results of several pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint (using 
the negative binomial regression model instead of the Poisson regression model of the primary analysis 
and evaluating only confirmed relapses, or confirmed and unconfirmed relapses for both models) were 
highly consistent with those of the primary analysis in the respective pivotal studies for the proposed 
1mg ozanimod daily dose. The Applicant provided additional analyses using a treatment policy strategy 
for  the  intercurrent  event  treatment  discontinuation  based  on  the  assumption  of  the  absence  of  a 
treatment effect after treatment discontinuation. Moreover, the Applicant provided post hoc sensitivity 
analyses using J2R and CR approaches for multiple imputation analyses for dealing with missing data. 
The results were consistent and supported the primary pre-planned analysis. 
Regarding the number of new/enlarging T2 brain lesions, there was a 42.4% (34.3%) reduction after 24 
months (Study RPC01-201B) and to a 48.3% (24.6%) reduction after 12 months of treatment (Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 109/188 
 
 
 
RPC01-301) for the 1 mg (0.5 mg) ozanimod dose compared to INF β-1a. The corresponding reductions 
for  GdE  brain  lesions  were  63.0%  (33.8%)  reduction  after  24  months  (Study  RPC01-201B)  and  to  a 
52.9%  (47.2%)  reduction  after  12  months  of  treatment  (Study  RPC01-301).  Sensitivity  analyses  for 
these  endpoints  also  consistently  showed  nominally  significant  differences,  respectively.  However, 
according to the pre-specified hierarchical multiplicity procedure and considering appropriate negative 
binomial model for the primary endpoint, key secondary endpoints could only be considered statistically 
significant for the 1mg dose in Study RPC01-201B. Results from multiple imputation analyses using J2R 
and CR were largely in line with pre-planned analyses.  
With  regard  to  the  3rd  key  secondary  endpoint,  disability  progression  confirmed  after  3  and  after  6 
months (CDP-3M, CDP-6M), no statistically significant differences between ozanimod and IFN β-1a could 
be shown. HR vs. IFN β-1a derived from the primary analysis of CDP-3M of 0.950 for 1 mg ozanimod 
and of 0.822 for ozanimod 0.5 mg corresponded to a numerical 5.0% and 17.8% relative risk reduction, 
however differences to IFN β-1a were not statistically significant (1 mg ozanimod: p=0.7651, 0.5 mg 
ozanimod:  p=0.2698).  Several  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  consistently  favoured  ozanimod over 
IFN β-1a regarding CDP-3M (at least numerically). 
Regarding CDP-6M the HRs of 1.413 for 1 mg ozanimod and of 1.189 for ozanimod 0.5 mg corresponded 
to a numerical relative risk increase for CDP-6M of 41.3% and 18.9% compared to IFN β-1a. These latter 
findings  might  raise  concerns  of  an  increased  risk  of  CDP  with  ozanimod  vs.  IFN  β-1a.  However,  the 
respective comparisons of CDP-6M were not statistically significant (1 mg ozanimod: p=0.1126, 0.5 mg 
ozanimod: p=0.4447). Similarly, some sensitivity analyses favoured ozanimod over IFN β-1a (at least 
numerically) some analyses favoured IFN β-1a, however, none of the comparisons that favoured IFN β-
1a were nominally significant. These results were indeed based on very low event rates (with proportions 
of  subjects  with  CDP-3M  and  CDP-6M  across  all  study  groups  equal  to  7.3%  and  4.9%,  respectively 
compared  to  the  12-24%  for  CDP-3M  that  had  been  assumed  based  on  historical  data).  The  short 
duration  was  also  considered  a  limitation  as  discussed  above.  In  this  regard, results  from  a  post-hoc 
sensitivity analyses including visits of the OLE Study RPC01-3001 to confirm the event as performed in 
ocrelizumab pivotal studies (EPAR Ocrevus EMA/790835/2017) showing very similar risks for CDP-6M in 
the 1 mg ozanimod group compared to IFN β-1a was considered reassuring. Additionally, the Applicant 
presented absolute differences between the ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a KM estimates for CDP-6M. The 
Applicant’s position that absolute differences between estimated probabilities may better reflect clinically 
meaningful differences than estimated hazard ratios in settings with low event rates was acknowledged 
by  CHMP.  According  to  this  analysis,  no  statistically  significant  difference  for  CDP-6M  outcomes  was 
found between both treatment groups, while an approx. 4% higher CDP-6M rate after 2 years could not 
be excluded as derived from the lower limit of the 95% CI of survival rates. However, the Applicant has 
additionally provided a Bayesian analysis, which estimated the probability of a 4% (or greater) difference 
in CDP-6M to be low (5.4%), further formal testing to evaluate a true difference of at least 4% yielded 
a  p-value  of  0.948.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  argued  that  the  point  estimate  of  the  analysis  would 
commonly be used to evaluate the clinical relevance of a finding, and the respective (not statistically 
significant) difference of 1.8 % between ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a was within the sampling variability 
based  on  the  95%  CIs.  Taking  the  totality  of  provided  analyses  of  CDP-3M  and  CDP-6M  data  and 
arguments into consideration, no clear differences between ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a could be shown 
with regard to disease progression.  
Finally, considering the knowledge about the mechanism of action (S1P modulator) of the molecule in 
MS  and  that  ozanimod  1  mg  consistently  showed  higher  effectiveness  regarding  focal  inflammatory 
activity  (relapses  and  T2  and  GdE  lesions)  in  comparison  to  IFN  β-1a,  an  increased  risk  of  CDP  of 
ozanimod compared to IFN β-1a could be reasonably excluded.   
In  both  pivotal  studies,  brain  volume  change  from  baseline  to  month  24  (Study  RPC01-201B)  and  to 
month 12 (Study RPC01-301), respectively was lower in both ozanimod groups compared to IFN β-1a.

For  the  1mg  dose  group  in  both  studies,  the  pre-specified  ANCOVA  (with  LOCF)  as  well  as  the  rank-
ANCOVA  (with  observed  cases)  model,  which  was  performed  post-hoc  due  to  non-normal  data 
distribution,  were  nominally  statistically  significant;  the  respective  differences  in  mean  %  change 
resulting from the pre-specified analysis roughly correspond to a relative treatment difference of brain 
volume change of 25% after 2 years (Study RPC01-201B), and to a relative reduction of 33% after 1 
year with 1 mg ozanimod compared to IFN β-1a. As analysis of brain volume change refers to a relative 
change  with  potentially  skewed  data  due  to  a  standard  deviation  of  the  original  data  that  may  be 
proportional  to  the  mean,  a  sensitivity  analysis  based  on  log-transformed  and  back  transformed 
normalised brain volume data was requested to the Applicant. Considering the bulk of data that supports 
the importance of brain volume change in MS, these results were considered to be relevant. However, it 
is  currently  not  established,  how  effects  on  brain  volume  change  translate  into  clinical  effects  (e.g. 
whether the same magnitude of brain volume change reductions translates into similar clinical effects 
over the MS course). Therefore, brain volume change cannot serve as a surrogate marker for disability 
and cannot justify a claim on disability progression without a clear and convincing effect on a clinical 
scale evaluating disease progression.   
In both individual pivotal studies, results of the pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
were generally consistent with the overall results for the 1 mg subgroup vs. INF β-1a (all resulting ARR 
ratios favoured 1 mg ozanimod over IFNβ-1a, and for most subgroups, the upper limit of the 95% CI 
was  below  1).  Similarly,  in  the  subgroup  analyses  of  the  pooled  pivotal  studies,  in  which  additional 
subgroups,  e.g.  based  on disease  activity  were  investigated,  a  consistent  treatment  effect  was  found 
with regard to 1 mg ozanimod vs. IFN β-1a. All pooled subgroup analyses were indicative of nominally 
statistical significance, except for the small number of treatment naïve subjects (i.e. subjects without 
any previous MS treatment including corticosteroids). It is of particular interest, that a treatment effect 
was found regardless of absence/presence of highly active disease, number of relapses in the prior one 
and two years, respectively, absent/present GdE lesions, number of T2 lesions, EDSS score at baseline, 
or prior DMT use status at baseline. Additional sensitivity subgroup analyses (of the individual as well as 
the pooled phase 3 studies) based on a negative binomial model with and without using a J2R approach 
for treatment discontinuation produced rather consistent results. Larger differences were obtained in the 
subgroup  of  patients  without  prior  MS  treatment  in  Study  RPC01-201B.  However,  this  subgroup  was 
relatively small, appears less relevant and the pooled analysis provided a reasonable effect even in this 
group.  
Subjects  with  prior  S1P  modulator  treatment  have  been  excluded  from  the  pivotal  trials,  which  was 
endorsed, as both substances in principle share the same mechanism of action. However, subjects with 
prior IFN treatment (including the active comparator IFN β-1a Avonex®) were allowed for inclusion in 
the pivotal studies, and approx. 10% of subjects in the pivotal studies had prior IFN β-1a. Additionally 
provided subgroup analysis for  subjects with/without prior IFN β-1a treatment revealed a statistically 
significant  difference  between  both  subgroups  in  favour  of  subjects  with  prior  IFN  β-1a  treatment 
(heterogeneity p-value: 0.0261 using the negative binomial model and 0.0112 using the Poisson model).  
The consideration that blinding may not have been satisfactorily maintained in subjects with prior IFN β-
1a treatment, as these subjects were familiar with the typical adverse events of Avonex, in particular 
flu-like symptoms, and/or that subjects with prior IFN β-1a, who were eligible for the pivotal studies, 
benefitted insufficiently from IFN β-1a treatment may provide a possible explanation for this difference. 
To address the CHMP’s concern that blinding may not have been satisfactorily maintained in subjects 
with  prior  IFN  β-1a  treatment,  the  Applicant  conducted  principal  strata  analyses  within  the  subset  of 
subjects with prior IFN β-1a use that resulted in a large reduction in ARR in the 1 mg ozanimod compared 
to IFN β-1a group in the No-flu-stratum (strata of subjects who would not obtain flu-like symptoms while 
treated with IFN β-1a). Considering the following arguments: i) subjects with prior IFN β-1a treatment 
will be included in the target population, ii) the subgroup of patients with prior IFN β-1a treatment was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 111/188 
 
 
 
small (approx. 10 % of the overall mITT population) and iii) the small differences in the treatment effect 
between the overall mITT analysis and the analysis of the subgroup without prior IFN β-1a (approx. -
42% and -39% reduction in ARR ratio in the 1 mg ozanimod vs. IFN β-1a groups), the CHMP agreed that 
the  treatment  effect  of  ozanimod  could  be  appropriately  estimated  from  the  overall  mITT  population. 
Consequently, there was no need for specifying treatment effects for the subgroups with and without 
prior IFN β-1a treatment separately in section 5.1 of the SmPC.      
The weight of the evidence from the efficacy endpoints suggested a more favourable benefit profile with 
ozanimod 1 mg, compared with the ozanimod 0.5 mg, as the overall magnitude of effect and consistency 
of response was greater with the 1 mg dose as compared to the 0.5 mg dose at Month 12 and Month 24 
for relapses and MRI markers of focal inflammatory activity.  
The maintenance of therapeutic response was assessed in the OLE Study RPC01-3001 (for which both 
pivotal studies, Study RPC01-201A Extension as well as phase I Study RPC 01-1001 served as parent 
studies; as of cut-off date of 30 June 2018). Although the informational value of OLE studies with regard 
to efficacy was naturally limited, results of ongoing OLE Study RPC01-3001 could be considered indicative 
of maintenance of effect of ozanimod 1mg with regard to relapses as ARR (adjusted and unadjusted) in 
the  subgroup  of  subjects,  who  were  already  treated  with  ozanimod  1  mg  in  the  parental  studies, 
appeared stable and even tended to slightly improve (unadjusted ARR of 0.164 during OLE compared to 
0.174 in parent study, and adjusted ARR of 0.133 during OLE compared to 0.153 during main part) and 
analyses of ARR on a yearly basis appeared to support these findings. Results in the T2 and GdE brain 
lesions were also maintained in subjects who remained on ozanimod 1 mg. Overall drop-out rate (6.9%) 
as well as drop-out due to lack of efficacy (1.0%) were low during OLE. However, whereas 760 subjects 
were constantly treated with 1 mg ozanimod though parent and OLE study, of which 398 were at least 
treated for 3 years, the number of subjects treated for at least 4 years was low as of data cut-off for 
MAA (30 Jun 2018) (n=44). Thus, efficacy results for longer than 3-year ozanimod exposure should be 
interpreted with particular caution. 
While the proportion of subjects with CDP-3M or CDP-6M continued to be low during OLE Study RPC01-
3001, results on CDP in these studies were difficult to interpret and these estimates would benefit from 
a longer follow-up. As stated in the CHMP MS guideline (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2, Section 5.1 - 
Treatments  intended  to  modify  the  natural  course  of  the  disease),  it  is  “highly  desirable  to  evaluate 
whether the effect on progression is maintained on a long-term basis for DMT. As, in general, the course 
of multiple sclerosis with respect to disability is slow, this may need years of follow-up, e.g. 5 years or 
even  longer.  However,  these  data  might  be  generated  post-approval.”  In  this  regard,  The  Applicant 
communicated that the final study results after all subjects will have been exposed to 1 mg ozanimod 
for a minimum of 5 years are scheduled to be available in 2022. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  ozanimod  in  subjects  with  relapsing  remitting  MS  has  been  demonstrated  with  the 
presented  primary  and  MRI  secondary  endpoints.  Notwithstanding,  efficacy  regarding  disability 
progression has not been shown. Therefore, the indication should not include MS forms evolving to SPMS 
with relapses.

2.7.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  overall  safety  evaluation  plan  assesses  the  data  obtained  from  a  total  of  23  clinical  studies  of 
ozanimod across all indications, including 7 Phase 2 and 3 studies and 16 clinical pharmacology studies. 
Ongoing blinded studies are not included in the safety analyses. 
Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
A total of 16 clinical pharmacology studies have been completed. Of these, 14 studies were completed 
before the data cut-off date of 30 Jun 2018: 
•  1  was  a  single  ascending  dose  and  multiple  ascending  dose  study  in  healthy  subjects  that 
evaluated the safety, tolerability, PK and PD. 
•  5 were single-dose studies in healthy subjects that evaluated the food effect, mass balance, and 
DDIs with itraconazole/rifampin, cyclosporine, propranolol/diltiazem. 
•  2 were single-dose studies that evaluated the effect of hepatic impairment or end stage renal 
failure on PK. 
•  4  were  multiple-dose  studies  in  healthy  subjects  that  evaluated  the  effect  on  the  QT  interval 
corrected  for  HR  (ie,  thorough  QTc),  DDI  with  oral  contraceptives,  and  the  effect  of  race 
(Japanese vs. Caucasian) on PK/PD (2 studies). 
•  1 was a multiple-dose study in healthy subjects that evaluated the cardiac effects of ozanimod 
re-initiation after different drug washout intervals. 
•  1 was a multiple-dose study in RMS patients that evaluated PK and PD. 
Two additional studies conducted in healthy volunteers were initiated after the data cut-off date: 
•  1 was a single-dose study to evaluate PK and drug interaction with modulators of the cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 2C8 and/or 3A. 
•  1 was a multiple-dose study to evaluate the effect of ozanimod on systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
following a single dose of pseudoephedrine. 
The safety data from these 2 studies were not included in the pooled analyses. 
Phase 2 and 3 Studies 
Seven Phase 2 and 3 studies were included in the safety analysis plan: 4 in RMS, 2 in UC, and 1 in CD 
(Table 20).

Study RPC01-3101 (parent study to RPC01-3102) is an ongoing blinded study not included in Pool C. 
Study RPC01-2201 is an open-label study. 
The primary focus of this safety overview was the 2 controlled Phase 3 RMS studies (Pool A1). Subjects 
in Pool A1 had similar exposure across 2 ozanimod treatment groups vs. an active control group within 
each study and remained on the same dose for the duration of each study. Pool A includes all controlled 
RMS  studies,  including  the  dose-ranging,  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  study.  Pool  B  provides  a 
comprehensive view of the safety of ozanimod in RMS subjects, as it comprises the Phase 1 RMS study 
and  all  Phase  2  and  3  RMS  studies,  including  long-term  data  from  the  respective  extension  studies 
(comparisons  to  control  were  not  provided  in  Pool  B  owing  to  the  disparate  exposures  across  the 
treatment groups). To further explore the safety of ozanimod, Pool C presented open-label data from 
the  Phase  2  and  3 IBD  studies,  while  Pool  D  (the  combination  of  Pools  B  +  C)  comprised  the  largest 
overall dataset, useful for the exploration of rare events. Clinical pharmacology studies were combined 
in Pool E.  
A total of 3,441 subjects were exposed to ozanimod across all patient studies (Pool D), including 3276 
subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg and 1098 subjects treated with ozanimod 0.5 mg. Of these, 2765 
subjects (84.4%) in the ozanimod 1 mg group and 938 subjects (85.4%) in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group 
were exposed for ≥ 12 months, and 1226 subjects (37.4%) in the ozanimod 1 mg group and 395 subjects 
(36.0%) in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group were exposed for ≥ 24 months. Total cumulative exposure to 
ozanimod 1 mg or 0.5 mg was 6446.6 and 1628.9 patient-years, respectively. 
The Safety Population for Pool A1 included 2659 subjects, of whom 882 subjects received at least 1 dose 
of ozanimod 1 mg, 892 subjects received at least 1 dose of ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 885 subjects received

A Patients-years of exposure was calculated as ([date of last dose – date of first dose]) +1)/365.25 
Note Pool A1 includes Studies RC01-201B and RPC01-301 
Approximately 92% of subjects in Pool A1 were exposed to ozanimod or IFN β-1a for at least 12 months, 
and approximately 34% of subjects in Pool A1 were exposed to ozanimod or IFN β-1a for at least 24 
months.  The  total  duration  of  exposure  was  well-balanced  across  treatment  groups  and  Pool  A1  was 
most appropriate to focus on for the characterization of the safety profile of ozanimod in the treatment 
of adult patients with RRMS. Total cumulative exposure to ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg was 1323.3 and 
1318.0 patient-years, respectively. Pool B, with 2787 subjects, included 1018 subjects followed for at 
least 36 months. 
The  demographic  characteristics  of  subjects  in  Pool  A1  were  generally  well  balanced  across  the  3 
treatment groups. The mean age of the total population was 35.5 years, 66.8% were female, 98.9% 
were  white,  89.7%  were  from  Eastern  Europe,  and  the  mean  weight  was  69.92  kg.  For  Pool  A1,  the 
disease history of subjects was generally well balanced across treatment groups. The mean time since 
MS  symptom  onset  for  the  three  treatment  groups  combined  was  6.7  years  and  mean  time  since 
diagnosis of MS was 3.7 years (the mean age at diagnosis was 32.1 years). In the 12 and 24 months 
prior to screening, the mean (median) number of relapses experienced by subjects was 1.3 (1.0) and 
1.7 (2.0), respectively. The mean EDSS score at baseline was 2.57. The reported medical history in Pool 
A1 was consistent with the disease population and known comorbidities of MS and was well-balanced 
across  the  3  treatment  groups.  The  most  frequently  occurring  comorbidities  were  nervous  system 
disorders  (38%),  of  which  optic  neuritis  was  most  frequent  (26.7%).  Other  frequently  occurring 
comorbidities  were  eye  disorders  (24.2%),  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (22.8%), 
infections and infestations (21.8%), surgical and medical procedures (18.4%), gastrointestinal disorders 
(15.7%), and vascular disorders (12.0%), primarily hypertension (6.5%). The demographics, baseline 
disease  characteristics,  MS  treatment  history,  and  concomitant  medications  for  Pool  A  and  for  Pool  B 
were consistent with those for Pool A1.  
Subjects >55 years of age were excluded from studies contributing to Pool A1. Approx. 8% of subjects 
in each treatment group in Pool B were 50-59 years of age due to participation in OLE Study RPC01-
3001.  The  only  data  in  subjects  aged  >60  years  derived  from  Pool  C  studies  with  5  and  52  patients 
between 60 and 69 years of age in the ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg group and 5 subjects aged 70 to 75 
years in the ozanimod 1 mg dose group. The Applicant justified the newly proposed posology wording

(“There  is  limited  data  available  on  RRMS  patients  >55  years  of  age”  ...)  with  the  US  FDA  4-months 
safety update  
(cut-off date 31-01-2019) including 161 subjects treated beyond the age of 55 during the study (pool 
B). Of note, no active comparison is available for safety data of patients > 55 years of age. An additional 
analysis of clinical safety data of these 161 patients included in Pool B were provided by the Applicant. 
The  limited  number  of  patients  >55  years  of  age  generally  exhibited  a  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  in 
contrast  to  patients  ≤55  years.  The  Applicant  position  that  the  increasing  incidence  of  TEAEs  with 
increasing age categories may be due to a higher reporting rate in older patients was supported by the 
reporting trend provided by the Applicant. The reporting rate of TEAEs was highest in the first 6 months 
of treatment and declined thereafter (data have been presented up to 78 months of treatment). TEAEs 
in patients >55 years of age were qualitatively in line with those reported for patients ≤ 55 years being 
the more remarkable quantitative differences found for liver function test abnormalities (ALT increased 
and  gamma-glutamyltransferase  (GGT)  increased)  and  cardiovascular  –  related  TEAEs  (hypertension 
and orthostatic hypotension). Overall it was agreed that currently available safety data in the elderly did 
not indicate a worsened safety profile of ozanimod in the elderly that would lead to a different perception 
of the benefit-risk profile. However, no firm conclusion could be made with regard to long-term safety in 
the elderly based on the limited number of elderly subjects evaluated in clinical trials as indicated in the 
section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Adverse events 
The overall incidence of AEs was lower in the ozanimod treatment groups compared with IFN β-1a, which 
was driven by the high rate of influenza-like illness seen with IFN β-1a (Table 23).  The incidences of 
severe and serious TEAEs were low and similar across the 3 treatment groups in Pool A1. Adverse events 
leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or to withdrawal from the study were infrequent in 
all  treatment  groups  and  reported  at  a  slightly  lower  incidence  in  the  ozanimod  treatment  groups 
compared  with  the  IFN  β-1a  group.  Adverse  events  leading  to  temporary  discontinuation  or  delay  of 
study  drug  (ie,  treatment  interruption)  were  infrequent  and  reported  at  a  similar  incidence  in  the 
ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a treatment groups, and at a slightly higher incidence in the ozanimod 0.5 
mg treatment group. During the controlled period, there was 1 death in the ozanimod 0.5 mg treatment 
group; there was 1 additional death in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group that occurred ~10 months 
after discontinuation of study drug. Neither death was considered by the investigator of the Sponsor to 
be related to ozanimod (Table 22).

There were 3 (unreconciled) data issues where sites incorrectly completed the question “Was subject terminated from Study due to 
this AE?” on the AE eCRF. Two subjects in the INF B-1a treatment group have “yes” indicated for termination from study due to the 
respective AEs but  should have “No” indicated for termination  from study due to the respective AEs. One subject in the ozanimod 
0.5mg group had “No” indicated for termination from study due to the AE of acute hepatitis B (PT) but should have “Yes” indicated for 
termination from study due to the event. Note: At each level of subject summarization, a subject is counted only once if the subject 
reported multiple events. 
Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events 
The  system  organ  classes  with  the  highest  proportions  of  subjects  reporting  AEs  were  Infections  and 
Infestations,  Nervous  System  Disorders,  and  Investigations.  Adverse  events  reported  by  ≥  5%  of 
subjects in any treatment group were nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, ALT 
increased, and influenza-like illness (Table 23). The incidence of nasopharyngitis was slightly higher in 
the ozanimod treatment groups compared with the IFN β-1a treatment group, but no dose effect was 
observed.  The  incidences  of  headache  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  were  similar  across  the  3 
treatment groups. A greater proportion of subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment groups reported ALT 
increased as compared to the ozanimod 0.5 mg and IFN β-1a treatment groups. Influenza-like illness 
and pyrexia are known side effects of IFN β-1a and, as expected, were reported at a higher incidence in 
IFN β-1a-treated subjects than in ozanimod-treated subjects. The overall higher incidence of AEs in the 
IFN  β-1a  treatment  group  compared  with  the  ozanimod  treatment  groups  could  be  attributed  to  the 
frequency of these events.

Note: Preferred terms are listed in order of decreasing frequency in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group. 
The most frequently reported AEs with ozanimod were defined as those reported in ≥ 2% of subjects in 
any treatment group and at a ≥ 1% higher incidence in either ozanimod treatment group compared with 
IFN β-1a (Table 24). Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported AE with ozanimod; the incidence 
was slightly higher in the ozanimod treatment groups compared with the IFN β-1a treatment group, but 
no  dose  effect  was  observed.  Other  frequently  reported  infections  involved  primarily  the  upper 
respiratory tract or urinary tract. ALT increased and GGT increased were reported more frequently in the 
ozanimod treatment groups than the IFN β-1a treatment group, with a modest dose effect observed for 
the reports of GGT increased. Orthostatic hypotension was reported at a slightly higher incidence in the 
ozanimod 1 mg, but not in the 0.5 mg treatment group, compared with IFN β-1a. These events occurred 
at a higher frequency in the first three months of treatment but were not imbalanced across treatment 
groups  during  the  dose  escalation  period.  Hypertension  was  reported  at  a  similar  incidence  in  both 
ozanimod treatment groups, higher than IFN β-1a.

Analysis of Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events by Maximum Severity 
The most frequently reported AEs with ozanimod were predominantly mild or moderate in severity across 
all 3 treatments. The incidence of moderate AEs was lower in the ozanimod treatment groups compared 
with the IFN β-1a treatment group, largely due to the higher incidence of moderate influenza like illness 
in the IFN β-1a group. The incidence of severe TEAEs was low and similar across the ozanimod 1 mg, 
ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a treatment groups (2.5%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The incidence 
of severe cases of individual AEs was < 1%. Severe AEs reported for >1 ozanimod-treated subject were 
ALT increased (1 subject [0.1%] on ozanimod 1 mg and 2 subjects [0.2%] on ozanimod 0.5 mg), GGT 
increased  (2  subjects  [0.2%]  on  ozanimod  0.5  mg),  and  abdominal  pain  upper  (1  subject  [0.1%]  on 
ozanimod 1 mg and 1 subject [0.1%] on ozanimod 0.5 mg). Severe AEs reported in >1 subject in the 
IFN  β-1a  treatment  group  were  influenza-like  illness  (8  subjects,  0.9%)  and  MS  relapse  (2  subjects, 
0.2%). 
Analysis of Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events by Time Interval 
The overall incidence of AEs was lower in the ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg treatment groups compared 
with IFN β-1 during Months 0 to 3 (35.9% and 36.4% versus 63.4%, respectively) and was generally 
similar across the 3 treatment groups during Months 3 to 6 (25.8%, 27.0%, 26.2%, respectively) and 
Months 6 to 12 (35.0%, 35.1%, 40.6%). The incidence of AEs in the ozanimod treatment groups was 
similar during each exposure interval.  
Among the most frequently reported AEs with ozanimod, the incidence of nasopharyngitis was generally 
similar across the 3 treatment groups during each exposure interval. The incidence of other infections

was generally similar across exposure intervals, although a higher incidence of respiratory tract infection 
viral was observed in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group during Months 0 to 3 compared with the other 
treatment groups, and a higher incidence of pharyngitis was observed in the ozanimod 0.5 mg treatment 
group during Months 3 to 6 compared with the other treatment groups. 
Long-term Use 
Pool B (All RMS Studies) and Pool D (All RMS + IBD Studies) provided the longest duration of exposure 
to ozanimod; total exposure to the 1 mg and 0.5 mg doses was 5660.5 PY and 1602.3 PY, respectively, 
for Pool B, and 6446.6 PY and 1628.9 PY, respectively, for Pool D. Approximately 94% of subjects in 
Pool B were exposed to ozanimod 1 mg or 0.5 mg for at least 12 months, and approximately 65% were 
exposed to ozanimod 1 mg or 0.5 mg for at least 24 months, the majority of whom were on 1 mg. The 
pattern and incidence of adverse events was similar for Pools A and B, with the exception of TEAEs of 
lymphopenia  (7.4%),  lymphocyte  count  decreased  (5.9%),  and  leukopenia  (1%),  which  were  only 
reported  for  ozanimod  1 mg  in  Pool  B  (i.e.  the  dose  administered  in  the  open-label  studies).  These 
adverse events were not reported in the controlled parts of the studies (Pool A1) in order to keep the 
investigator blinded. For the most frequently reported PTs in Pool A1 (≥ 5%), the incidences during long-
term  treatment  presented  with  Pool  B  data  remained  within  the  level  of  controlled  studies  or  even 
decreased, with the exceptions of lymphopenia and lymphocyte count decreased (not reported in Pool 
A1). Among the special safety topics evaluated, there was no observed worsening of the safety profile 
with  longer  exposure  (up  to  68  months).    Among  the  special  safety  topics  evaluated,  there  was  no 
observed decrement of the safety profile with longer exposure (up to 68 months). Nevertheless, non-
serious herpes zoster was reported with longer-term exposure in Pool B, specifically during OLE Study 
RPC01-3001 (see adverse event of special interest (AESI) section on infections). 
A single case of possible PML under ozanimod treatment was reported to have occurred in the ongoing 
OLE Study RPC01-3001 leading to discontinuation of study drug (reported to EMA on 24-02-2020). Given 
that no cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal was performed, PML could neither be ruled out nor confirmed for 
this case. 
Collectively,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  and  severe  AEs  in  the  ozanimod  treatment  groups  was  not 
increased compared with IFN β-1a. The study data do not indicate cumulative toxicity of ozanimod, since 
no significant worsening in the safety profile with prolonged ozanimod exposure has been observed. 
Safety Topics of Interest 
Based on the known biology of S1P modulators special attention was directed at assessing cardiac effects, 
hepatic effects, infections, consequences of lymphopenia, macular oedema, malignancies and pulmonary 
effects. Depression and suicidality were also identified for detailed analysis because of their association 
with the underlying disease state.  
Cardiac Effects 
The  S1P1  receptor  is  highly  expressed  in  atrial,  septal,  and  ventricular  cardiomyocytes.  After  initial 
agonism, continuous dosing results in functional antagonism and down-regulation of S1P. Activation of 
S1P  receptors  on  cardiac  cells  provides  an  explanation  for  the  transient  effects  on  heart  rate 
(bradycardia)  and  atrioventricular  conduction.  S1P  modulators,  initiated  at  the  full  dose,  result  in  a 
transient  reduction  in  heart  rate  (of  8  bpm)  on  Day  1  and,  less  commonly,  a  temporary  delay  in 
atrioventricular (AV) conduction observed in some patients (DiMarco, 2014). High-grade AV conduction 
abnormalities occurred in some patients, treated with non-selective S1P modulators. First dose effects 
resulted in the regulatory requirement for first-dose observation when initiating treatment with S1P non-

selective  modulators.  The  S1P1  receptor  is  expressed  on  all  endothelial  and  vascular  smooth  muscle 
cells,  where  it  appears  to  contribute  to  the  regulation  of  endothelial  barrier  function  and  peripheral 
vascular tone. Modulation of S1P1 on these cells may result in blood pressure effects. In adult Relapsing 
MS  controlled  clinical  trials,  patients  treated  with  a  non-selective  S1P  modulators  had  an  average 
increase  over  placebo  of  approximately  3  mm  Hg  in  SBP,  and  approximately  1  mm  Hg  in  DBP,  first 
detected after approximately 1 month of treatment initiation, and persisting with continued treatment. 
Hypertension  was  reported  as  an  adverse  event  in  approx.  6.5%  of  patients  on  a  non-selective  S1P 
modulator and in approx. 3.3% of patients on placebo.  
Subjects with certain pre-existing cardiovascular conditions (e.g., myocardial infarction, unstable angina, 
stroke,  transient  ischemic  attack,  decompensated  heart  failure  requiring  hospitalization,  Class  III/IV 
heart failure, sick sinus syndrome, or severe untreated sleep apnoea) were only eligible to participate in 
the active-controlled Phase 3 RMS studies if the event occurred more than 6 months prior to screening.   
Based  on  Phase  1  data  and  experience  with  S1P  modulators,  a  7-day  dose-escalation  approach  was 
implemented  in  the  ozanimod  Phase  2  and  3  clinical  programs  which  consisted  of  treatment  with 
ozanimod 0.25 mg on Days 1 to 4 and ozanimod 0.5 mg on Days 5 to 7. Patients allocated to ozanimod 
1mg  received  the  first  1mg  on  day  8.  This  dose  regimen  was  shown  to  be  successful  in  mitigating 
chronotropic and dromotropic effects observed after initiation at the full (maintenance) dose due to the 
initial S1P1 agonism. Based on results from study RPC01-1910, a dose interruption for up to 14 days 
after a 28-day course of treatment is not associated with significant changes in HR upon retreatment 
(section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
First-dose experience and monitoring 
Using  this  approach  in  the  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  study,  no  clinically  meaningful  HR  reductions, 
conduction abnormalities (24 h Holter monitoring during the dose escalation period), or AE reports of 
bradycardia  with  the  initial  dose  escalation  regimen  on  Days  1,  5,  and  8  were  observed  between 
ozanimod  and  placebo.  Cardiac  conduction  (measured  by  ECG  and  Holter  monitoring)  was  not 
differentially affected by ozanimod vs. placebo during titration. No second-degree AV blocks type II or 
higher were reported. Second-degree AV block type 1 (24h-Holter monitoring) was similarly observed in 
subjects on ozanimod and placebo (almost exclusively on Day 1: 2.3% and 2.4% in subjects on placebo 
and ozanimod 0.25 mg, respectively). 
In the active-controlled Phase 3 studies including approximately 1,774 subjects treated with ozanimod, 
the 6-hour monitoring data on Day 1 demonstrated that ozanimod was associated with only a modest 
and  not  clinically  meaningful  reduction  in  mean  HR  on  Day 1  (mean  HR  reduction  from  baseline  of 
1.2 bpm with a nadir at Hour 5, with return towards baseline by Hour 6). Second- or third-degree AV 
block were not reported in the active-controlled Phase 3 RMS studies and no patient was reported with 
a HR < 40 bpm. It should be noted that patients with clinically significant cardiovascular history were 
excluded  from  these  studies  as  were  patients  taking  medications  that  reduce  HR  or  affect  cardiac 
conduction. 
In the OLE Study RPC01-3001 (ozanimod 1 mg), consistent results were demonstrated at the time of 
ozanimod dose escalation initiation. A non-clinically meaningful reduction in mean HR (-1.2 bpm) was 
observed  in  subjects  who  switched  from  IFN  β-1a.  No  conduction  abnormalities  were  identified. 
Moreover, ozanimod did not affect cardiac repolarization. 
‘Symptomatic bradycardia’ was reported in two subjects belonging to the ozanimod 0.5 mg group during 
the dose escalation period (with 0.25 mg) in Pool A1. ‘Symptomatic bradycardia’ was rated an important 
potential risk to be monitored during post-marketing routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities 
(ORION Study).

Blood pressure changes were uncommon with first dose administration of ozanimod. Incidence of events 
of  vascular  disorders  were  therefore  low  and  evenly  distributed  across  treatment  groups  during  dose 
escalation. 
Long-term cardiac experience 
Chronic  treatment  with  ozanimod  resulted  in  a  slightly  increased  mean  HR  over  baseline  level  in  all 
treatment  groups  at  Week  24  (phase  2  study)  and  Month  24  (controlled  part  of  phase  3  trials), 
respectively  (increases  of  approximately  2  bpm  or  less).  No  clinically  significant  changes  in  ECG 
parameters were observed with chronic treatment in either treatment group. Specifically, there were no 
second- or third-degree AV blocks observed in the phase 3 studies. The Applicant proposed that patients 
presenting with (or with a history of) second-degree AV block Type II or third-degree AV block must not 
be treated with ozanimod. 
Blood  pressure  changes  were  noted  with  long-term  ozanimod  treatment:  SBP  increased  by  Month  24 
across all treatment groups but slightly higher in subjects on ozanimod as compared to IFN ß-1a. The 
mean increase at Month 3 in SBP was 1.6 mmHg increase over IFN ß-1a, which corresponds to a mean 
increase in SBP from baseline of 4.1 mmHg for ozanimod 1 mg. A discrete increase in DBP at Month 3 
was similarly observed (DBP: 0.9 mmHg increase over IFN ß-1a) corresponding to a mean increase in 
DBP from baseline of 1.8 mmHg for ozanimod 1 mg. At Month 24, the mean change from baseline for 
OZA 1 mg was 5.2 mmHg (SBP) and 2.3 mmHg (DBP). Among subjects who entered the OLE, similar 
small increases in SBP of approximately 4 mm Hg were observed in subjects who switched from IFN β-
1a  or  who  continued  from  an  ozanimod  parent  treatment  group.  The  effect  on  SBP,  DBP  and 
hypertension-related  events  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC  Patients  with  uncontrolled 
hypertension were not per se excluded from participation in clinical trials with ozanimod. Upon request, 
the Applicant clarified that for these 124 patients with a post-hoc definition of uncontrolled hypertension 
(SBP>140 mmHg or DBP>90 mmHg at baseline) a worsening of pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension 
was not observed. Nevertheless, the Applicant proposed a specific warning to obtain cardiologist advice 
before initiation of ozanimod in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension, which was agreed by CHMP. 
The  incidence  of  specific  events  from  the  cardiac  disorders  SOC  (e.g.  bradycardia  and  AV  block  first-
degree) did not substantially increase with longer treatment up to 24 months in Pool A1. However, the 
incidence  of  events  from  the  vascular  disorders  SOC  (e.g.  orthostatic  hypotension  and  hypertension) 
was  higher  in  subjects  on  ozanimod,  dose-related  (3.4%,  3.5%,  and  2.0%  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg, 
ozanimod  0.5  mg,  and  IFN  β-1a  treatment  groups,  respectively)  and  in  line  with  cardiac  monitoring 
results described above (discrete increase in SBP and DBP after approx. 3 months). In OLE Study RPC01-
3001, the incidence of AEs in the Cardiac Disorders and Vascular Disorders SOCs did not increase with 
longer-term exposure with ozanimod 1 mg.  
Sponsor-designated events of interest (SDEI) included a thorough compilation of events from vital signs 
and ECG monitoring, cardiac disorder TEAEs and conduction abnormalities. A higher incidence of SDEIs 
in the ozanimod groups (16.7% and 17% for ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg, compared to 13.6% for IFN 
ß-1a) is mainly driven by events in line with a reduced HR during the initial 6-hour monitoring on Day 1.  
Cardiovascular  medical  history  was  found  to  increase  the  incidence  of  cardiac  disorders  (such  as 
bradycardia and first-degree AV block) in subjects on ozanimod, while such conditions were less affecting 
the  incidence  of  events  in  the  IFN  ß-1a  group.  Even  more  pronounced  was  the  occurrence of  cardiac 
disorders in subjects with concomitant cardiovascular medications (all treatment groups) compared to 
subjects  without  those  medications  (with  CV  medication:  IFN  ß-1a  2.7%,  ozanimod  0.5 mg  10.6%, 
ozanimod 1 mg 7.5%; without CV medication: IFN ß-1a 2.7%, ozanimod 0.5 mg 2.4%, ozanimod 1 mg 
2.7%). Events of vascular disorders (such as hypertension) were more frequently observed in subjects 
with  CV  medical  history  and  those  with  concomitant  CV  medication.  Hypertension  and  orthostatic 
hypotension were the TEAEs most frequently reported and thus in line with the safety profile of ozanimod.

Although,  these  analyses  argued  for  an  increased  cardiovascular  risk  in  patients  with  underlying  CV 
conditions  and/  or  CV  medication  treated  with  ozanimod,  which  was  additionally  supported  by  the 
analysis  of  SDEIs  for  CV  medical  history/risk  (yes/no),  the  Applicant  clarified  that  the  numerical 
imbalance between subjects with and without concomitant cardiovascular medication was mainly driven 
by events of bradycardia and sinus bradycardia on Day 1 of dosing. Moreover, metabolism and nutrition 
disorders (such as hypercholesterolemia and obesity) predominated the observed imbalance of TEAEs in 
ozanimod vs. IFN ß-1a treated patients with/ without cardiovascular history in the cardiac and vascular 
disorders  SOC.  Additional  analyses  of  concomitant  medical  history  and  concomitant  cardiovascular 
medication  were  quite  reassuring  that  the  imbalances  between  ozanimod  and  IFN  ß-1a  could  be 
attributed to the cardiac safety profile of ozanimod.  
Concomitant administration of class Ia or class III antiarrhythmic drugs was not investigated and might 
worsen  the  cardiac  safety  of  ozanimod.  The  Applicant  addressed  the  need  for  enhanced  vigilance  on 
cardiac safety with these medications and thus proposed a warning in section 4.4 to obtain cardiologist 
advice on treatment initiation/monitoring in patients treated with antiarrhythmics, which was deemed 
acceptable  given  that  the  most  critical  time  for  cardiac  TEAEs  with  ozanimod  is  during  treatment 
initiation. The present data supported the need for additional monitoring during treatment initiation in a 
number of patients (i.e. those with a HR<45 bpm, HR is the lowest value post-dose (after 6 hours), new 
onset  second-degree  or  higher  AV  block  at  the  6 hour  post-dose  ECG,  and  QTc  interval≥500 ms)  to 
determine  the  individual  cardiovascular  response  to  ozanimod.  In  addition,  specific  conditions  (i.e. 
cardiac history, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, medicinal products that are known to potentiate 
bradycardia, and antiarrhythmic drugs (class Ia and III) require cardiologist advice prior to treatment 
initiation to decide on the safe use of ozanimod and monitoring during treatment. This information is 
reflected  in the  sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  the  RMP  adequately  reflects  “long-term 
cardiovascular effects” as missing information to address the need for data with ozanimod treatment in 
patients  suffering  from  cardiovascular  comorbidities.  Additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  are 
proposed to address this issue (besides other long-term safety aspects, i.e. the ORION Study and long-
term follow-up of OLE Study RPC01-3001).  
Even though long-term experience from clinical trials do not raise significant cardiovascular concerns, it 
should be stressed that subjects with several pre-existing conditions (as indicated above) were excluded 
from  clinical  studies  with  ozanimod.  Despite  their  exclusion  from  participation  in  clinical  trials,  some 
patients presented at baseline with a resting HR <55 bpm, with prolonged QTcF interval or additional 
risks for QT prolongation, as well as with concomitant medication known to impact cardiac conduction 
(63  patients  on  ozanimod  1 mg  and  42  patients  on  IFN  β-1a).  Although,  during  the  dose-escalation 
period, a slightly higher incidence in bradycardia-related TEAEs (none with a baseline HR<55 bpm) and 
vascular disorder – related TEAEs (hypotension, orthostatic hypotension) was observed in patients with 
potentially  excluded  cardiac  conditions  as  compared  to  the  overall  population,  the  difference  was 
marginal. Based on a summary of maintenance data of these patients, no cardiovascular TEAEs were 
reported for the subjects on ozanimod 1 mg after initial dose escalation up to Day 90.  After Day 90, 
there was a similar low incidence of TEAEs in patients on ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a in line with the 
cardiac  safety  profile  of  ozanimod.  All  patients  continued  treatment  with  ozanimod.  The  incidence  of 
cardiac  disorder-related  TEAEs  in  subjects  with  concomitant  QT  prolonging  medication  during 
maintenance treatment (beyond Day 11) was not markedly different from the incidence in the IFN β-1a 
group. The recommendations on pre-existing cardiac conditions were adequately reflected in section 4.4 
of the SmPC taking into account the contraindications on certain relevant cardiac conditions (i.e. patients 
with  history  or  presence  of  second-degree  AV  block  Type  II  or  third-degree  AV  block  or  sick  sinus 
syndrome unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker) in section 4.3.

Consistent with what has been observed with other S1P receptor modulators, hepatic enzyme elevations, 
including ALT, AST, and GGT, were seen with ozanimod treatment (Table 25).

Number of subjects with an assessment 
ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; GGT = gamma-glutamyltransferase; IFN = interferon; ULN = 
upper limit of normal.  
Note: Categories (x ULN) correspond to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) 
4.03 grading.  
No  clear  trend  for  a  time-dependency  could  be  deduced  for  ALT  (and  AST)  across  Pool  A1,  but 
postbaseline  GGT  abnormalities  gradually  increased  within  24  months  of  observation.  Changes  in 
bilirubin were overall small and occurred more frequently with ozanimod than with IFN β-1a. Small total 
bilirubin  changes  appeared  to  be  related  to  unconjugated  (indirect),  pre-hepatic  bilirubin  changes 
(typically  observed  with  conditions  of  Gilbert’s  disease)  rather  than  direct  bilirubin  changes  (typically 
observed with toxic/ drug-induced liver changes).  
Subjects with previous hepatic conditions or baseline liver enzyme abnormalities were generally found 
to be more susceptible for liver enzyme changes/ postbaseline abnormalities with ozanimod. Comparison 
with Pool B data did not suggest an increased risk for hepatic enzyme changes beyond 24 months of 
treatment.  
The median time to postbaseline abnormalities in ALT≥3x ULN (and also GGT>2.5x ULN) was 6 months 
for  subjects  on  ozanimod  and  recovery  to  ALT<3x  ULN  was  observed  within  one  month  despite 
continuous treatment (and similarly after drug discontinuation), while normal ALT limits (≤1x ULN) were 
not  achieved  within  4  months.  AST  postbaseline  abnormalities  occurred  less  frequently  and,  in  more 
subjects,  IFN  β-1a  with  a  later  median  time  to  onset  (after  approx.  9  months)  and  a  more  thorough 
resolution. A median time of 9 months to onset was also observed for postbaseline bilirubin abnormalities 
in subjects on ozanimod.  
The  incidence  of  hepatic-related  AEs  was  evaluated  in  the  SOCs  of  Hepatobiliary  Disorders  and 
Investigations.  While  there  were  more  reports  of  elevations  of  hepatic  laboratory  abnormalities 
(Investigations SOC) in the ozanimod treatment groups compared to IFN β-1a, there were no differences 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 127/188 
 
 
 
 
 
in symptomatic AEs, and few subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to hepatic-related AEs 
(1.2%,  0.4%,  and  0.8%  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg,  ozanimod  0.5  mg,  and  IFN  β-1a  treatment  groups, 
respectively).  
A greater incidence of liver enzymes elevations was observed in males compared to females, which has 
also been reported with S1P modulators. Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, factors that 
may  explain  this  different  gender  response  include:  higher  baseline  aminotransferase  levels  in  males 
versus females; higher baseline weight and BMI in males versus females; and a higher likelihood of fatty 
liver  disease  and  alcohol  consumption  (which  was  not  evaluated  in  these  trials)  between  males  and 
females. 
Across  the  entire  ozanimod  clinical  development  program  (RMS  +  IBD  studies  [Pool  D]),  there  were 
10/3441 subjects (0.3%) with concurrent ALT/AST ≥ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN suspect of 
hepatotoxicity  (Hy’s  law).  Two  subjects  were  treated  with  ozanimod  0.5  mg,  whereas  8  were  on 
ozanimod 1 mg (from the study entry or switched to 1 mg ozanimod) at the time of concurrent elevation. 
All 10 subjects had recovery (to < 3 x ULN) or resolution (to ≤ 1 x ULN) of the lab abnormalities either 
on  treatment  (n=3  [2  with  Gilbert’s  syndrome,  1  with  lab  error])  or  after  study  drug  discontinuation 
(n=7). An external expert Hepatic Advisory Board reviewed these cases and concluded that none of the 
cases met the criteria for Hy’s Law on the basis of the presence of comorbid conditions associated with 
liver function test abnormalities and/or the pattern of laboratory abnormalities (Hepatic Advisory Board 
minutes). 
The findings on hepatic safety were comparable for long-term treatment with ozanimod by comparison 
of  incidence  rates  between  Pool  A  (controlled  RMS  studies)  and  Pool  B.  The  incidence  rate  of 
hyperbilirubinaemia was found to increase during long-term treatment with ozanimod 1 mg, most likely 
caused by patients who switched from a control group to ozanimod 1 mg in the extension studies. 
Data  from  the  ozanimod  development  program  seem  to  be  in  line  with  real-world  pharmacovigilance 
data from S1P modulators, which showed a signal for laboratory abnormalities but not for severe hepatic 
events (Antonazzo, 2018). Ozanimod therapy at a 1 mg or 0.5 mg daily dose is well below the daily dose 
range (usually greater than 50 mg) of oral medications most often associated with drug-induced liver 
injury (Lammert, 2008; Yu, 2014). 
To  conclude,  ozanimod  treatment  leads  to  increases  in  hepatic  enzymes  and  might  thus  worsen  pre-
existing liver impairment. The extent of worsening remains unknown given that subjects with defined 
pre-existing hepatic conditions, including chronic hepatic impairment or liver enzymes/ bilirubin ≥1.5x 
ULN were excluded from clinical studies. Upon request, severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C) was 
listed  as  a  contraindication  in  section  4.3  of  SmPC.  The  Applicant  also  updated  4.4  SmPC  to  provide 
further details for routine liver monitoring including time intervals, retesting in case of increases above 
ULN, and stopping rules. 
Infections 
Infections in the controlled study experience 
In Pool A1, no differences were observed between treatment groups in the overall incidence of infections 
(34 to 35%) and infections that occurred at least 1% higher in the ozanimod groups as compared to IFN 
β-1a  were  nonserious  and  probably  seasonal  infections  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract  (i.e. 
nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, and viral respiratory tract infection) and urinary tract infections. Likewise, 
no differences in serious infections could be observed (ranging from 0.6 to 1% across groups) and these 
comprised  appendicitis  and  typical  bacterial/  viral  infections  and  resolved  without  clinical  sequelae 
following standard medical management. Discontinuations due to infections were rare and similar across 
groups  (0.1%).  No  disseminated  or  serious  opportunistic  infections  were  reported.  Opportunistic 
infections  included  herpes  zoster/  varicella  zoster  virus  infections,  and  these  were  slightly  higher  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 128/188 
 
 
 
subjects on ozanimod vs. IFN β-1a (0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.6% in subjects on IFN β-1a, ozanimod 0.5 mg, 
and  ozanimod  1 mg).  Subjects  with  zoster  infections  continued  on  ozanimod  treatment  without  any 
clinical consequences.  
Long-term risk for infections 
Systemic  opportunistic  infections  were  not  reported  with  long-term  exposure  of  ozanimod  in  clinical 
studies. No cases of PML were identified in the ozanimod clinical program up to the data cut-off (30 June 
2019).  On  24  February  2020,  EMA  became  aware  of  a  possible  first  case  of  PML  under  ozanimod 
treatment in the ongoing OLE Study RPC01-3001. A female subject (age 50-60) in the OLE Study RPC01-
3001 presented  with  (partially  recovered)  disability  worsening  (worsening of  the  neurological  status), 
for whom PML cannot be formally excluded. The patient’s MRI showed a lesion (‘right temporal lobe brain 
MRI lesion’) that was initially treated as MS lesion by the investigator but considered as consistent with 
the  radiographic  appearance  of  PML  after  being  reviewed  at  the  Sponsor’s  request  by  external 
neuroradiologists.  The  patient  presented  with  only  mild  lymphopenia  [0.89x109/L]  on  the  day  of 
admission. Other lymphocyte count measurements during treatment with ozanimod over 3.5 years in 
OLE Study RPC01-3001 were consistently in the normal range. Blood tests for JCV were negative for JCV 
DNA by PCR and positive for JCV antibodies. Given that no cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal was performed, 
PML  could  neither  be  ruled  out  nor  confirmed  (possible  PML  case  according  to  International  PML 
diagnostic criteria). Nevertheless, ‘Serious opportunistic infections including PML’ was already included 
as an important potential risk in the summary of safety concerns proposed for ozanimod. An adequate 
warning about PML is stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Reports of “candida infections” and “fungal infections” almost exclusively occurred in Pool B. Comparisons 
of  incidence  rates  between  uncontrolled  open-label  data  and  controlled  parent  study  data  as  well  as 
controlled Pool A(A1) and overall Pool B data did not suggest an increased risk of non-serious infections 
with  continued  treatment.  In  contrast,  incidence  rates  of  serious  infections  were  slightly  higher  with 
extended exposure in subjects who had switched from a parent study with 0.5 mg to open-label 1 mg 
Ozanimod in OLE Study RPC01-3001, and in Pool B compared to Pool A1, also likely due to switches from 
placebo or IFN β-1a in a parent study to open-label ozanimod 1 mg.  
There was an increase in the incidence of local and manageable herpes zoster infections in the open-
label extension (included in Pool B; 30 Jun 2018) compared with the active-controlled studies (Pool A1); 
however, no further substantial increase in the incidence was observed with longer treatment (Pool B; 
31 Jan 2019) (Table 26). None of the reported herpes zoster infections with long-term treatment was 
serious or led to discontinuation. Section 4.4 includes an adequate recommendation of VZV vaccination 
in patients without documented immunity to VCV. 
In addition, an increased risk for infections is to be expected within 3 months after discontinuation of 
ozanimod in line with the duration of lymphocyte recovery given the long mean elimination half-life of 
ozanimod metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 of ~11days (i.e. lymphocytes recovered in 80 to 90% 
of subjects on ozanimod 1 mg within 2 to 3 months after stopping treatment). The need for increased 
surveillance is described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The  treatment  of  subjects  with  severe  active  infections  and  active  chronic  infections  (e.g.,  hepatitis, 
tuberculosis) with ozanimod is contraindicated (SmPC section 4.3) in line with exclusion criteria set in 
the  phase  3  study  protocols  and  the  recommendations  stated  for  other  S1P  modulators.  Additional 
warning  was  included  in  section  4.4  regarding  a  delay  in  initiation  of  therapy  until  the  infection  is 
resolved.  Furthermore,  patients  with  prior  or  concomitant  antineoplastic,  immunosuppressive,  or 
immune-modulating therapies were generally excluded from clinical studies. The incidence in TEAEs from 
the infections and infestations SOC in patients with prior DMT treatments (evaluated as ‘extrinsic factor’) 
appeared higher as compared to those without prior DMTs in line with ALC abnormalities. However, the 
differences  were  small  and  did  not  point  towards  a  generally  different  safety  profile  in  patients  with 
Assessment report

previous  immunomodulating  therapy.  In  order  to  account  for  the  lack  of  data  in  these  patients,  the 
Applicant  included  a  general  contraindication  in  section  4.3  of  the  SmPC  for  patients  with 
“immunodeficient state” encompassing all forms of immunodeficiency (e.g. due to intercurrent illness or 
as the result of immunosuppressive therapy). Additional warning is included in section 4.4 in line with 
other S1P modulators and description of possible interaction in section 4.5.

Lymphocyte reduction and risk of infection 
Reductions in lymphocyte counts were expectedly reported, based on the mode of action of ozanimod, 
in nearly all patients in the ozanimod 1 mg group (shift from baseline to low in 94% of patients) compared 
to the IFN ß-1a group (shift from baseline to low in 24.4% of patients). There was a dose-dependent 
reduction  of  peripheral  lymphocyte  count  to  approx.  45%  of  baseline  at  Month  3,  corresponding  to  a 
mean blood lymphocyte count of 0.8 x 109/L and this reduction was sustained throughout the treatment 
period.  In  pool  A1,  dose-dependent  reductions  in  ALC  to  values<0.5  x  109/L  were  observed  in  the 
ozanimod  1  mg,  ozanimod  0.5  mg,  and  IFN  β-1a  treatment  groups  (54.7%,  25.3%,  and  1.6%  of 
subjects, respectively). Dose-dependent reductions in ALC to values<0.2 x 109/L (grade 4) were also 
observed in the ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg treatment groups (3.3% and 0.4%, respectively), versus 
none  in  the  IFN  β-1a  treatment  group.  Serious  infections  including  opportunistic  infections  were  not 
associated with an ALC value of <0.2x 109/L in Pool A1. 
In the overall pool of RMS subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg (Pool B, N = 2631), with up to ~75 
months  of  exposure  as  of  31  Jan  2019,  the  mean  reduction  in  ALC  of  ~55%  from  baseline  observed 
within 3 months was generally maintained through the data cut-off date of FDA 4-months safety update 
(4MSU) (31 Jan 2019). Despite persistent lymphopenia, there was no increase in the overall incidence 
of infections, serious infections, or other opportunistic infections with longer exposure.  
Using  Pool  B  (the  broadest  base  of  safety  information  in  the  RMS  population),  to  assess  the  possible 
relationship between ALC reduction and the incidence of serious or opportunistic infections, considering 
ALC  was  assessed  every  3  months,  subjects  with  serious  or  opportunistic  infections  were  analysed 
according  to  the  lowest  ALC  recorded  prior  to  the  onset  of  the  first  infection  and  the  subsequent 
measurement. In Pool B, 5.5% of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg were reported with an ALC values 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020

<0.2x  109/L  any  time  during  treatment  and  except  for  a  single  subject  with  a  serious  infection  of 
pyelonephritis  concurrent  with  the  ALC<0.2  x  109/L,  none  of  them  had  a  concurrent  serious  or 
opportunistic infection Table 27.  
Time to recovery of lymphocyte counts less than 1 x 109/L to within normal range took up to 3 months 
in 90% of patients. Lymphopenia is stated as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

c Includes 10 subjects with herpetic infections (herpes zoster, herpes simplex, oral herpes, or ophthalmic herpes simplex) and 1 
subject with a genital Candida infection (all nonserious). 
Malignancies 
Malignancies were examined due to the potential effects of ozanimod as an immunomodulatory agent. 
In Pool A1, the incidence of AEs in the SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (including 
Cysts and Polyps) was similar across treatment groups (21 [2.4%] subjects, ozanimod 1 mg; 19 [2.1%] 
subjects, ozanimod 0.5 mg; 24 [2.7%] subjects, IFN β-1a). To confirm the characterization of an event 
as  a  malignancy,  medical  review  of  individual  events  identified  by  a  comprehensive  Standardized 
MedDRA Query search was undertaken.  
Subjects with a history of malignancies (other than treated basal cell carcinoma) were excluded from 
the Phase 3 RMS studies. In the pool A1, there were 12 total malignancies. Of the 10 total malignancies 
in  the  ozanimod  groups,  5  were  cutaneous  (3  basal  cell  carcinoma,  one  keratoacanthoma  and  one 
malignant melanoma in situ[retrospectively determined to be pre-existing by the Sponsor]) and 5 were 
non-cutaneous  (3  breast  cancer,  1  testicular  seminoma  and  1  medulloblastoma[retrospectively 
determined to be pre-existing by the Sponsor]) (Table 28). There were 2 malignancies in the IFN β-1a 
treatment group, a basal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The extent of safety follow-
up  in  Pool  A1  was  1326.88  person-years  (PY)  for  IFN  β-1a  and  2686.82  PY  for  the  ozanimod  groups 
combined. The incidence of any malignancies in the active-controlled Phase 3 RMS studies (Pool A1) was 
low (0.6%, 0.6%, and 0.2% in the ozanimod 1 mg, ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a treatment groups, 
respectively), which corresponded to study duration-adjusted incidence rates (IR) per 100,000 person-
years  (PY)  of  372.2,  373.6,  and  150.8,  respectively  (Table  28).  To  allow  for  more  meaningful 
comparisons with established reference sources, malignancies were further classified by the exclusion of 
nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) as well as subjects whose malignancy, upon Sponsor review, was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020

assessed to have been pre-existing (Table 28). A post hoc Fisher’s exact test failed to show a statistically 
significant  association  between  the  incidence  of  malignancy  (any  or  any  excluding  pre-existing 
malignancies) and treatment with either ozanimod 1 mg or 0.5 mg versus IFN β-1a. The incidence rates 
per 100,000 PY (95% CI) for malignancies (excluding NMSC) and for malignancies (excluding NMSC and 
preexisting)  in  the  ozanimod  groups  combined  (223.5  [82.0,  486.4]  and  148.9  [40.6,  381.4], 
respectively) were similar to the rate of 202.7 (201.4, 204.1) for the comparable age range (20 to 54 
years)  in  the  general  US  population  in  2014  based  on  a  Surveillance,  Epidemiology  and  End  Results 
(SEER) database analysis (which excludes NMSC) (SEER, 2017). The incidence rate per 100,000 PY (95% 
CI) for any malignancies (including pre-existing cases) in the ozanimod groups combined (372.9 [178.8, 
685.7]) did not show an increased risk relative to the estimated background rates of any malignancies 
in MS patients which have been reported: approximately 370 per 100,000 PY in the British Columbia MS 
study  (Kingwell,  2012)  and  approximately  673  per  100,000  PY  according  to  the  Danish  MS  register 
(Nielsen, 2006).

aOne event of malignant melanoma in situ and 1 event of medulloblastoma (both in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group) were determined 
retrospectively to be pre-existing. The subject with medulloblastoma had a history of optic neuritis and documented multiple sclerosis 
for 7 years prior to randomization. Note: Incidence rate per 100,000 PY is calculated as number of subjects / PY x 100,000 for specific 
malignancy SDEI category. For a subject in a particular category, the time on study is calculated based on the date the subject first 
meets an SDEI criterion within the category (date first criterion is met - first dose date of study drug + 1)/ 365.25; for subjects who 
don't meet an SDEI criterion in the category, the time on study is the study duration (last date on study - first dose date of study drug 
+1)/365.25;

A comprehensive review of DMT that have received marketing authorization for MS did not suggest an 
increased cancer risk with these agents (Lebrun, 2018). The incidence rates per 100,000 PY (95% CI) 
for any malignancies with ozanimod 1 mg (372.2 [120.8, 868.5]) and 0.5 mg (373.6 [121.3, 871.8]) 
were at the low end of the range of what has been reported for any malignancies in controlled Phase 3 
clinical  trials  of  recently  approved  DMTs  in  patients  with  RMS  (range,  352  to  1200  per  100,000  PY) 
(Mavenclad  EPAR,  2017;  Gilenya  CDER  medical  review,  2010;  Tecfidera  CDER  medical  review,  2013; 
Aubagio CDER medical review, 2012). Furthermore, ozanimod malignancy rates were 0.6% in both the 
1 mg and 0.5 mg groups in Pool A1. Similar incidences were reported in a recent meta-analysis of 11 
Phase 3 trials (with a similar overall duration of exposure as Pool A1) with DMTs registered for use in MS 
(dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and glatiramer acetate). The 
combined malignancy incidence rates in this meta-analysis were 0.6% for the active treatment groups 
and 1.2% for the placebo groups (Pakpoor, 2015). The incidence rate per 100,000 PY of nonmelanoma 
skin cancers (including basal cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma) in the ozanimod groups combined 
was 149.0 (95% CI: 40.6, 381.6), which compares with reported rates of 146 to 422/100,000 PY for a 
US population (Minnesota and Hawaii, respectively) (Chuang, 1990; Reizner, 1993). 
Long-term risk for malignancies 
Long-term  treatment  with  ozanimod  (based  on  Pool  B  data)  was  not  associated  with  an  increase  in 
malignancies beyond Pool A1. Overall, incidence rates per 100,000 PY were essentially similar or even 
lower  as  compared  to  those  in  Pool  A1  for  any  malignancy  but  also  after  exclusion  of  pre-existing 
malignancies and/or NMSC. For Pool B (all RMS studies), the incidence rate per 100,000 PY (95% CI) for 
malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) was 191.6 (104.8, 321.5); with the exclusion of pre-
existing malignancies as well as nonmelanoma skin cancer, the incidence rate was 164.2 (84.9, 286.9) 
per 100,000 PY. These incidence rates compared favourably with the rates observed in Pool A1 (223.5 
and  148.9  per  100,000  PY,  respectively),  indicating  that,  with  longer  exposure,  the  incidence  of 
malignancies in the RMS studies did not increase. Malignancies during long-term treatment not reported 
in  Pool  A1  included  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (of  skin),  cervix  carcinoma,  clear  renal  cell  carcinoma, 
glioblastoma, metastasis, pancreatic carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer, and uterine cancer, which were 
reported in a single subject each. Cutaneous malignancies were similarly observed in subjects with IBD 
and subjects with RMS. Noncutaneous malignancies in Pool C were different in IBD studies and in line 
with the underlying disease. Pool D (all RMS + Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) studies) rates for all 
malignancies  368.9  (248.9,  526.7)  and  for  those  that  excluded  nonmelanoma  skin  cancer  and  pre-
existing malignancies 196.3 (112.2, 318.8) did not show meaningful differences in the exposure rates 
when  compared  with  Pool  A1;  confidence  intervals  overlapped  with  rates  from  SEER.  There  were  no 
reports of lymphoma (typical for immunosuppression) in the ozanimod clinical program. 
Four cases of breast cancer (PTs of breast cancer and invasive breast carcinoma) were reported in Pool 
B, including 3 during the active-controlled studies (Pool A1). Although, this appears striking, only one 
additional  case  was  reported  in  the  OLE  Study  RPC01-3001  despite  an  approximately  3-times  higher 
patient-years  of  exposure  in  Pool  B.  Breast  cancer  seemed  not  to  increase  with  longer  ozanimod 
treatment duration. This frequency is within the expected incidence over the treatment period of 4.86 
events  of  breast  cancer,  calculated  by  applying  the  SEER  incidence  rate  for  breast  cancer  in  an  age-
matched  (20-  to  54-year-old)  female  population  (92.4/100,000)  to  female  subjects’  exposure  to 
ozanimod  in  Pool  B  (5256.7  SY).  Using  these  data,  the  standardized  incidence  rate  (SIR)  for  breast 
cancer in Pool B is estimated to be 0.82 (95% CI: 0.22, 2.11) (data on file). By comparison, the SIR of 
breast cancer in the MS population has been estimated to range between 0.94 (0.77, 1.31) and 1.21 
(1.05, 1.39) across 4 different population-based studies (Kyritsis, 2016). The risk for breast cancer might 
be increased in females with multiple sclerosis although etiology is unclear. Furthermore, two-thirds of 
the MS patients studied were female. In contrast, no breast cancer was reported in the IBD program 
with ozanimod, where 60% of all ozanimod-treated patients were male.

During the procedure, the Applicant provided additional data (6-months of additional data) derived from 
FDA 4MSU. Overall, four more malignancy events were reported within the time period of the 4MSU (31 
January  2019),  i.e.  one  additional  case  of  breast  cancer  (PT  breast  neoplasm),  one  case  of  bile  duct 
cancer  (later  not  confirmed  as  malignancy  but  hydatid  cyst),  and  two  additional  cases  of  basal  cell 
carcinoma  (not  further  addressed  by  the  Applicant).  The  total  of  5  breast  cancer  cases  (all  in  RMS 
subjects)  remained  within  the  expected  incidence  of  breast  cancer  over  the  treatment  period  of  5.79 
events, calculated by applying the SEER incidence rate for breast cancer in an age-matched (20- to 54-
year-old)  female  population  (92.4/100,000)  to  all  female  subjects’  exposure  to  ozanimod  in  Pool  D 
(6269.9 PY [4MSU]). Using these data, the SIR for breast cancer in ozanimod-treated female subjects is 
estimated to be 0.86 (95% CI: 0.28, 2.01), which compares with the SIR reported in the MAA of 0.82 
(95% CI: 0.22, 2.11). It was acknowledged that the additional case of breast cancer did not change the 
previously reported incidence rate. Reported malignancies up to 31 Jan 2019 (4MSU) are provided for 
Pool B (ozanimod RMS subjects) in Table 29. In particular, the incidence rates of nonmelanoma skin 
cancers and also rates of other malignancies, including breast cancer, were not increased with longer 
exposure  to  ozanimod  at  the  time  of  the  4MSU  and  remained  within  expectations  for  the  general 
population  and  the  age-matched  MS  population  in  the  SEER  cancer  registry.  Malignancies,  such  as 
lymphomas, that have been commonly observed with broader immunosuppressive therapies, have not 
been reported.

To conclude, although, numerically there were more malignancies reported with ozanimod than with IFN 
β-1a, the incidence rates, with wide confidence intervals, did not appear to indicate an increased overall 
risk of malignancies or an incidence rate that increases with greater exposure duration. The malignancies 
reported  did  not  demonstrate  any  specific  pattern  and  were  also  not  typical  of  those  observed  in  an

immunosuppressed population (e.g., no cases of lymphoma were seen). Upon review of the provided 
incidences of cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies in Pool A1 (the basis for inclusion of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) in SmPC section 4.8) and in consideration of the 4MSU, it was agreed with the 
Applicant that no specific type of cancer could be retrieved, which would qualify as a designated ADR in 
section 4.8. Longer follow-up with larger numbers of exposed patients are required to make a robust 
assessment regarding risk of malignancy associated with ozanimod treatment.  
In the awareness of the potential risk of skin neoplasm formation with S1P modulators, patients treated 
with ozanimod should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. Upon request, the 
Applicant included a warning on the section 4.4 of the SmPC so patients treated with ozanimod should 
be  cautioned  against  exposure  to  sunlight  without  protection  and  should  not  receive  concomitant 
phototherapy  with  UV-B-radiation  or  PUVA-photochemotherapy.  In  addition,  skin  neoplasms  were 
eminent in patients after marketing authorisation of S1P modulators prompting recent risk minimisation 
measures  (see  EMA/688187/2015  and  EMA/82227145/2017).  Adequate  risk  minimisation  measures 
were  aligned  with  the  currently  approved  SmPC  of  S1P  modulators.  Available  (long-term)  data  for 
ozanimod did not suggest that the risk for malignancies is different to S1P modulators and as such, the 
same warnings and measures are applicable, e.g. warning on immunosuppressive effects that could lead 
to 
an

risk 
for 
developing 
cancer 
in 
line  with 
the 
outcome 
of 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001393/201702. Given the imbalance in malignancies observed with IFN β-1a and 
ozanimod,  “malignancy”  was  included  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities were proposed to further address the long-term risk for malignancies (ORION Study and long-
term  follow-up  of  OLE  Study  RPC01-3001).  Moreover,  and  in  line  with  S1P  modulators,  ozanimod  is 
contraindicated in patients with known active malignancies. 
Macular Oedema 
Macular  oedema  was  examined  closely  because  of  the  effect  of  S1P  receptor  modulation  on  vascular 
endothelial cells. In the ozanimod RMS program, OCT was used as a standard screening tool to identify 
subjects for further ophthalmologic examination. The OCT was evaluated at baseline and Months 6, 12, 
and (in Study RPC01-201B) 24 in the controlled studies, at the end of the 6-month Study RPC01-201A 
Extension, and every 12 months in the OLE Study RPC01-3001. If an OCT abnormality was identified, or 
if  visual  signs  or  symptoms  of  ME  observed,  an  ophthalmological  examination  was  performed  by  an 
ophthalmologist  (preferably  a  retina  specialist),  including  eye  history,  visual  acuity,  and  dilated 
ophthalmoscopy,  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  of  macular  oedema  and/or  to  identify  other  ophthalmic 
abnormalities. An assessment of macular oedema was conducted by an expert panel (Macular Edema 
Review Panel (MERP)) who reviewed all AEs of macular oedema and AE preferred terms that could be 
associated  with  macular  oedema,  as  well  as  OCT  findings  potentially  suggestive  of  macular  oedema 
(regardless of whether an macular oedema-related AE was reported), and ophthalmic examinations. The 
MERP  was  comprised  of  3  neuro-ophthalmologists  and  a  retina  specialist  who  were  blinded  to  study 
treatment throughout all panel reviews.  
Minor mean increases in central foveal thickness were observed across treatment groups but lacking a 
dose-dependency  or  a  time  effect.  Abnormal  values  in  subjects  with  normal  values  at  baseline  were 
highest  around  Month  6  in  any  group  not  exceeding  an  incidence  of  5%.The  incidence  of  confirmed 
macular  oedema  cases  in  the  controlled  Phase  3  RMS  studies  (Pool  A1)  was  1/882  (0.1%)  in  the 
ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 3/892 (0.3%) in the ozanimod 0.5 mg treatment group (there were 
none in the IFN β-1a treatment group). An additional 3 confirmed cases were identified in the OLE Study 
RPC01-3001,  for  a  total  of  7/2787  (0.3%)  in  the  RMS  clinical  program.  Two  confirmed  cases  were 
identified in the IBD program. Overall (Pool D), there were 9/3441 (0.3%) confirmed cases of macular 
oedema reported in the entire ozanimod program (Pool D: 0.2% for ozanimod 1 mg, 0.3% for ozanimod 
0.5 mg), of which 4 cases derived from Pool A1 (0.1% for ozanimod 1 mg, 0.3% for ozanimod 0.5 mg). 
Cases  of  macular  oedema  in  the  controlled  studies  did  not  occur  before  6  months  of  treatment  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020

variable time to onset from baseline. However, amongst the five cases from open-label experience with 
ozanimod, two happened within 2 months of starting ozanimod (while treatment in the parent studies 
was  placebo  or  IFN  β-1a).  Therefore,  regular  ophthalmologic  evaluation  for  all  patients  might  not  be 
useful given the lack of a clear time-dependence.  
All cases of macular oedema were identified with OCT findings consistent with macular oedema and all 
cases  were  associated  with  pre-existing  risk  factors  or  comorbid  conditions  that  are  known  to  cause 
macular oedema. Eight of the 9 subjects recovered following discontinuation of study drug; the remaining 
case (secondary to ocular trauma) was reported to be stable as of the last available follow-up. Clinical 
signs  associated  with  macular  oedema,  such  as  visual  acuity  defect  or  complications  such  as  retinal 
detachment, were not indicated in these patients. However, in three patients from the open-label studies, 
the narratives indicated symptoms of decreased visual acuity, decreased vision, and vision blurred. The 
incidence  of  macular  oedema  in  the  ozanimod  clinical  program  (0.3%)  was  lower  than  the  reported 
incidence of 0.6% with placebo in a meta-analysis of controlled studies with S1P modulators, (Pul, 2016). 
At  present,  no  increased  risk  for  macular  oedema  can  be  deduced  from  available  long-term  data 
compared to controlled studies. 
To conclude, no confirmed case of macular oedema was reported in a control group and macular oedema 
has thus been added as an ADRs SmPC section 4.8. Patients with a history of uveitis and diabetes mellitus 
type I or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II have an increased risk for developing macular oedema 
and were thus not eligible for study inclusion, which is adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.4. Besides 
an initial ophthalmologic evaluation before commencing therapy with ozanimod, follow-up evaluations 
on-treatment in patients with risk factors (such as history of uveitis and diabetes mellitus) need to be 
implemented. Patients who present with confirmed macular oedema should have treatment discontinued. 
A decision on whether or not ozanimod therapy should be re-initiated after resolution of macular oedema 
needs to take into account the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient as indicated in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. Additional pharmacovigilance activities are proposed for this important potential safety 
concern (ORION Study and long-term follow-up of OLE Study RPC01-3001), which is adequate. 
Pulmonary Effects 
The  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  S1P  receptor  modulators  on  bronchial  smooth  muscle  cells  could 
potentially lead to a worsening of pre-existing pulmonary conditions in patients with MS.  
Minor mean and median reductions from baseline over time were observed in PFT (including FEV1, FVC, 
FEV1/FVC ratio, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)), which were slightly higher in subjects 
on  ozanimod  1 mg  as  compared  to  ozanimod  0.5 mg  or  IFN  β-1a.  These  changes  were  not  clinically 
meaningful and were primarily driven by changes during the first 3 months. These early small changes 
for the 1 mg ozanimod dose relative to 0.5 mg ozanimod dose or IFN β-1a were not progressive through 
12 months. An examination of the FEV1 and FVC from Month 12 through 24 using just the Study RPC01-
201B, which was controlled through 24 months, showed similar, small changes from Month 12 through 
24 in all treatment groups which were not meaningfully different. The absolute changes at any given 
time point for FEV1 or FVC were unlikely to be of clinical significance. The median change from baseline 
for FEV1 and FVC at Month 12 and Month 24 with ozanimod 1 mg was approx. 100 ml. The variability in 
the estimates (standard error of the mean [SEM]) over time results in a significant overlap across the 
treatment  groups  suggested  for  lack  of  any  meaningful  difference.  Examination  of  the  subjects  with 
outlier values below 80% or 60% on 2 or more consecutive assessments, or with their last value below 
the 80% or 60% threshold, respectively, indicated no differences across the treatment groups. In order 
to look for subjects with potential pulmonary changes related specifically to lung volume restriction an 
examination  of  subjects  with  concurrent  decreases  from  baseline  (<  80%)  in both  DLCO  and  FVC  was 
done. Eight subjects (2 in ozanimod 1 mg, 4 in the ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 2 in IFN β-1a) were identified 
and all continued in the trial without respiratory AEs that were serious or led to discontinuation. Five of 
Assessment report

these  8  subjects  came  from  1  investigator  site.  It  is  notable  that  of  the  8  subjects  with  concurrent 
decreases in FVC and DLCO, the baseline % predicted FVC was greater than 100 in 7 out of 8 with the 2 
highest likely representing erroneous and/or unphysiological values. Collectively, the declines in FVC in 
these subjects may represent regression to the mean or learning effect rather than a clinically significant 
reduction in lung function. Importantly, the lack of association of PFT findings to related AEs suggested 
that these observed small changes at the ozanimod 1 mg dose were not clinically meaningful. Respiratory 
AEs in the active-controlled Phase 3 RMS studies were similar across treatment groups with few SAEs 
and no AEs that led to discontinuation. The totality of the pulmonary data indicated that mild reductions 
in FEV1 and DLCO occurred early in treatment with ozanimod 1 mg but were not clinically meaningful and 
did  not  progress.  Furthermore,  the  data  did  not  demonstrate  an  increased  incidence  of  respiratory-
related AEs in comparison to IFN β-1a. 
Data from Pool B for a total of 24 months of controlled treatment with ozanimod 1 mg indicate small 
reductions in FEV1 and FVC (expressed as median percent reductions from baseline) mainly at Month 3 
and no further significant reductions were noted at later time points up to Month 24 (FEV1 Month 3: -
1.8%,  Month  24:  -3.4%).  Percent  changes  in  median  FVC  values  from  baseline  up  to  24  months 
considerably fluctuated. 
At present, there is no evidence for an increase in the (long-term) incidence of respiratory adverse events 
(such as asthma, dyspnea and other obstructive events) with ozanimod treatment as compared to IFN 
β-1a. However, PFT-related adverse events (i.e. FEV1 decreased) were almost exclusively reported for 
ozanimod  1 mg  in  Pool  A1  (0.7%)  and  Pool  B  (0.5%)  in  the  summary  of  SDEIs.  Summary  of  PFT 
abnormality PTs revealed a slightly higher incidence of subjects with any reported PFT abnormalities in 
the ozanimod 1 mg group (1.7%) compared with the IFN β-1a group (0.8%). The difference in incidences 
between  these  two  groups  mainly  derives  from  FVC  decreased  and  FEV1  decreased.  Therefore, 
‘pulmonary  function  test  abnormal’  was  added  as  ADR  to  SmPC  section  4.8  with  more  detailed 
explanation  given  in  the  subsection  of  ‘Description  of  selected  adverse  reactions’  on  the  respiratory 
system.  
Patients were excluded from studies if they had clinically relevant pulmonary disease or PTFs indicating 
FEV1 or FVC <70% of predicted values at screening. For S1P modulators, caution is advised in patients 
with  severe  respiratory  disease,  pulmonary  fibrosis  and  COPD).  A  discussion  was  presented  on 
pulmonary function parameters in ozanimod-treated patients, who are at risk for worsening of pulmonary 
function.  Of  note,  patients  with  conditions like  asthma  or  COPD  were  not  excluded  from  clinical  trials 
despite those with a screening FEV1 or FVC <70% of predicted values. However, a total of 11 patients 
presented with such values at baseline. Of these, only a single subject (on ozanimod 1 mg) had an outlier 
result. For current smokers with <80% of baseline PFT for two consecutive post-baseline visits or on the 
last post-baseline visit, outlier analyses of FEV1 and FVC showed more patients affected on ozanimod as 
compared to IFN  β-1a,  while  the overall percentage  was  low.  At  least  for  those  with  FVC  outliers,  no 
concomitant adverse events or actions on the measurements have been reported. It is acknowledged 
that no firm conclusion can be drawn based on the limited number of subjects with more pronounced 
pulmonary conditions like COPD. However, regarding patients with a medical history of asthma, outliers 
were solely reported in the ozanimod 1 mg group. More subjects with baseline FEV1 % predicted or FVC 
% predicted <80% had an outlier result after being treated with ozanimod as compared to IFN β-1a. 
Given  the  limited  data  on  patients  treated  in  clinical  ozanimod  studies  with  a  medical  history  of 
respiratory function impairment and given the above results, a general warning statement in Section 4.4 
with regard to caution for patients with specific underlying respiratory conditions has been included. 
Other Safety Topics 
Depression and Suicidal Ideation or Behavior 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 137/188 
 
 
 
 
S1P receptor modulators are not known to increase the risk of depression or suicidality. Ozanimod seems 
not to induce depression, suicide and suicide-related events, all of which occurred in a low and similar 
number of subjects across treatment groups throughout clinical studies. In the only placebo-controlled 
study of ozanimod in MS patients (Study RPC01-201A), no signal of increased risk of depression over 
placebo was identified for ozanimod with the incidence of depression for the ozanimod 1 mg group not 
differing from that reported for the placebo group (1 case each, 1.2% versus 1.1%, for ozanimod 1 mg 
and placebo, respectively. 
Two suicidal attempts were mentioned in the RMS program (one in Study RPC01-201B another in the 
OLE Study RPC01-3001). Upon request, the Applicant provided additional evidence about available SAEs 
in line with suicidal actions, including (serious) events of intentional overdose. In total, four subjects on 
ozanimod  were  reported  to  either  have  had  a  TEAE  of  suicide  attempt  (one  subject)  or  intentional 
overdose  (2  subjects)  or  both,  suicide  attempt  and  intentional  overdose  (one  subject  on  ozanimod 
0.5 mg), three of which had a history of depression. Neither of these cases was found related to study 
drug.  The  overall  assessment  of  suicidality  does  not  give  rise  to  a  concern  that  ozanimod  triggers 
suicidality. Moreover, one case reporting craniocerebral injuries resulting from traumatic-mechanic event 
was evaluated and conclusion by the investigator was that this did not represent suicidal intent. 
Overdose with Ozanimod 
One subject who had been receiving ozanimod 1 mg for approximately 1 year in OLE Study RPC01-3001 
intentionally ingested more than 100 pills of prescription medications, including ozanimod. This event 
was  recorded  as  an  intentional  overdose  by  the  investigator.  The  patient  experienced  no  symptoms 
related to overdose. Abnormalities in the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale were present at baseline 
prior to initiation of ozanimod. 
Abuse Potential 
Ozanimod and CC112273 did not show potential for abuse liability based upon assessment in a rat self-
administration study. Across the ozanimod clinical development program, there was no evidence for drug 
abuse, misuse, withdrawal symptoms, or dependence on ozanimod. There was no evidence for ozanimod 
having the potential for abuse based on a comprehensive review of AE reports. 
Rebound and Withdrawal Effects 
Rebound in MS has been defined as exceptionally high disease activity with a severe increase in disability 
and multiple new MRI brain lesions following discontinuation of therapy (Evangelopoulos, 2018; Hatcher, 
2016). There is no evidence for this type of rebound effect associated with the cessation of ozanimod. 
A post hoc analysis of ARR in subjects who discontinued study drug was conducted to assess the potential 
for  disease  rebound  following  the  cessation  of  treatment.  The  active-controlled  Phase  3  RMS  studies 
included a 28-day post-treatment follow-up visit. An assessment of relapses occurring during the 28-
day posttreatment follow-up was conducted in subjects who 1) permanently discontinued study drug in 
the treatment period of the parent studies, or 2) following completion of the treatment period and prior 
to the first dose of study drug in the OLE Study RPC01-3001. The subject-years on study was short as 
the majority of subjects continued in the OLE and the time before enrolment into the OLE was generally 
≤2 weeks. A total of 6 relapses were reported during this period: 1 subject in the ozanimod 1 mg dose 
group, 1 subject in the ozanimod 0.5 mg dose group, and 4 subjects in the IFN β-1a group, resulting in 
lower relapse rates in the ozanimod dose groups (unadjusted ARRs of 0.058 and 0.056 for ozanimod 1 
mg and 0.5 mg respectively) compared with the IFN β-1a group (unadjusted ARR of 0.235). The subject 
in the ozanimod 1 mg group discontinued study drug prematurely due to an AE of irritability and reported 
a  relapse  19  days  after  stopping  ozanimod.  The  relapse  was  reported  as  nonserious,  moderate  in 
severity, and partially recovered. There was no evidence that this event represented a worsening from 
baseline.

Withdrawal effects were evaluated by an analysis of AEs with onset after the last dose, in particular those 
that occurred in at least 2 subjects and: 1) had the potential to reflect signs and symptoms indicating 
activity of the treated disease after study discontinuation, or 2) are potentially life threatening. There 
were no AEs indicative of withdrawal reported in the active-controlled Phase 3 RMS studies. 
There  was  no  evidence  of  rebound  or  withdrawal  in  the  active-controlled  Phase  3  RMS  studies. 
Nevertheless, phase 3 studies routinely observed patients for 28 days after drug discontinuation, which 
may not have been sufficient to observe effects following withdrawal of ozanimod considering the long 
half-life  of  the  active  metabolites  CC112273  and  CC1084037  which  may  mitigate  the  potential  for 
rebound or  withdrawal  effect.   Therefore,  additional  wording  on  “Return  of  disease  activity  (rebound) 
after ozanimod discontinuation” has been included in SmPC section 4.4 to reflect this concern together 
with  the  class  effect  known  for  S1P  receptor  modulators.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  correctly  classified 
“Effects  following  withdrawal  of  drug’  as  ‘missing  information”,  for  which  post-marketing  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are planned using long-term studies/ extension study data from ORION and 
OLE  Study  RPC01-3001  to  further  evaluate  possible  rebound  effects  in  relation  to  MS  disease  state 
recrudescence, full recovery from lymphopenia and carry over effects to subsequent MS therapy. 
Method for Defining Adverse Drug Reactions in Product Information 
A thorough justification of ADRs to be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC was provided by the Applicant. 
ADRs were selected based on the incidence of reports (≥ 2% overall and ≥ 1% higher than IFN β-1a 
during  the  controlled  Phase  3  studies,  and  in  consideration  of  AEs  reported  in  the  placebo-controlled 
Phase  1  and  2  studies)  and  medical  assessment  (including  a  causality  determination  by  use  of  the 
Bradford-Hill criteria, and in consideration of the mechanism of action of ozanimod and possible class 
effects).  
All AEs reported in the ozanimod clinical development program were considered in the selection of ADRs, 
including a review of both placebo-controlled and active-controlled studies in consideration of the known 
safety profile of IFN β-1a. Each ADR is categorized by frequency (ie, very common, common, uncommon, 
or rare) based on the subject incidence reported in the ozanimod 1 mg group in Pool A1 (N=882). This 
method is consistent with the European Commission’s guidance on the estimation of frequency of adverse 
reactions [A Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics, Rev. 2, September 2009] and the Council 
for  International  Organizations  of  Medical  Sciences’  Guidelines  for  Preparing  Core  Clinical-Safety 
Information on Drugs, 2nd Edition (CIOMS, 1999). 
There were 19 AEs reported in the controlled Phase 3 RMS studies (Studies RPC01-301 and RPC01-201B 
[Pool  A1])  with  a  frequency  ≥  2%  of  subjects  in  the  total  ozanimod  group:  rhinitis,  nasopharyngitis, 
pharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  respiratory  tract  infection  viral  bronchitis,  urinary  tract 
infection, ALT increased, GGT increased, insomnia, depression, headache, fatigue, arthralgia, influenza 
like illness,  hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, back pain and abdominal pain upper. Ten of these 
19 AEs were reported at an incidence ≥ 1% higher in any ozanimod dose group than in the IFN β-1a 
group:  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  respiratory  tract  infection  viral,  urinary  tract  infection,  ALT 
increased, GGT increased, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, back pain, and abdominal pain upper. 
Two of these 10 AEs were rejected as ADRs because the evidence did not support a causal relationship 
to  ozanimod  treatment  (i.e.  back  pain  and  abdominal  pain  upper).  The  remaining  8  preferred  terms 
provided  enough  evidence  for  an  association  to  ozanimod  treatment  as  ADRs.  These  included 
nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection viral, urinary tract infection, ALT increased, GGT 
increased, hypertension and orthostatic hypotension.  
In  addition,  events that  were  assessed  as  causally  related  to ozanimod  treatment  but less  frequently 
than 2% included bradycardia, hypersensitivity (including rash and urticaria) and herpes zoster. 
Lymphopenia is an expected pharmacologic effect of ozanimod and is included as an ADR.

In the course of this procedure, further events have been classified as adverse drug reactions, including 
macular  oedema,  blood  bilirubin  increased  and  pulmonary  function  test  abnormal  based  on  the 
aforementioned criteria. 
As pharmacovigilance activities, two studies were planned to address most proposed concerns: 
•  ORION study, a post authorization, multinational, long-term noninterventional study to evaluate 
the long-term safety profile of ozanimod in the real-world setting. 
• 
Long-term follow-up of OLE Study RPC01-3001 to characterise the long-term safety of ozanimod 
in patients with relapsing MS. 
No additional risk minimisation measures for any concern other than routine measures are proposed or 
deemed necessary. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
In Pool A1, the incidence of SAEs was very low and similar across treatment groups (4.6%, 5.3% and 
4.4% in the ozanimod 1 mg, ozanimod 0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a treatment groups, respectively), with most 
SAE terms reported in single subjects. No discernible trends in any type of SAE were noted across the 
treatment groups, and no dose-related effects were observed (Table 30).  
Table 30: Incidence of Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 2 Subjects 
in Any Treatment Group – Pool A1 (Safety Population) 
In Pool B, long-term exposure to ozanimod of up to 68 months revealed a slightly higher incidence of 
SAEs for patients in the ozanimod 1 mg group (Pool B) as compared to Pool A1 (7.2% vs. 4.6%). An 
increase in the incidence of SAEs from Pool A1 to B was noted for the infections and infestations system 
organ class (SOC) with ozanimod 1 mg (Pool A1: 1%; Pool B: 1.4%), obviously driven by continuous 
dosing of 1 mg, whereas SAEs were less frequently reported in patients on 0.5 mg or “switchers” from 
0.5 mg to 1 mg (1.7% vs. 0.6% and 0.8%). No accumulation of specific types of serious infections was 
found.

Deaths 
Seven deaths, all in subjects on ozanimod, were reported up to the data cut-off on 30 Jun 2018 in the 
ozanimod clinical program. Five deaths occurred in RMS subjects, including 2 that occurred during the 
controlled Phase 3 studies (Pool A1) and 2 that occurred during the OLE (Study RPC01-3001). None of 
these deaths were considered to be related to study drug by the investigator or the Sponsor. Two deaths 
occurred  in  the  IBD  program,  1  in  the  UC  program  and  1  in  the  CD  program.  These  deaths  were 
considered to be related to study drug by the investigator and unrelated to study drug by the Sponsor.  
The events surrounding each death were summarized below: 
Two deaths in the Controlled Phase 3 RMS Studies (Pool A1)  
On Study 
•  A young female (age ranging 20-30 years) subject who received ozanimod 0.5 mg for approximately 
21 months in Study RPC01-201B, died from accidental drowning on Study Day 637. There was no 
medical  or  family  history  of  depression  or  suicide.  An  autopsy  was  not  performed,  and  a  death 
certificate  was  not  provided.  The  event  was  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  study  drug  by  the 
investigator. 
Off Study 
•  A young female (age ranging 20-30 years) subject who received ozanimod 1 mg for approximately 
11 months in Study RPC01-201B before discontinuing study drug due to Guillain-Barré syndrome on 
Study Day 332 and PRES. The subject died approximately 10 months after the last dose of ozanimod 
as a result of chronic kidney failure. Relevant past medical history included toxic hepatitis. The event 
of chronic kidney failure was considered to be unrelated to study drug by the investigator. 
Three deaths during the RMS OLE Study RPC01-3001 
•  A young female (age ranging 20-30 years) subject who received ozanimod 0.5 mg for approximately 
12 months in Study RPC01-301 and at least 1 dose of ozanimod (0.25 mg) in OLE Study RPC01-
3001 (last dose date unknown), died in the hospital on Study Day 69 (449 days from the first dose 
of  ozanimod)  from  multiple  craniocerebral  injuries  resulting  from  traumatic-mechanic  event.  The 
subject  did  not  have  a  medical  history  of  suicidal  ideation  or  depression,  and  the  investigator 
indicated that there was no evidence of depression or suicidality during the study. Relevant medical 
history included prior concussion, abdominal cavity injury, cervical polyps (removed), bradycardia, 
and  metabolic  cardiomyopathy.  The  event  was  considered  to  be  unrelated  to  study  drug  by  the 
investigator. 
•  A  middle-aged  male  (age  ranging  40-50  years)  subject  who  received  ozanimod  1  mg  for 
approximately  12  months  in  Study  RPC01-301  and  for  approximately  13  months  in  OLE  Study 
RPC01-3001, died on Study Day 404 due to a pulmonary embolism after a 38-day hospitalization 
due to a surgical repair of a lower limb fracture. The subject's last dose of ozanimod 1 mg was on 
Day 395. No treatment was reported for the event. The investigator considered the event unrelated 
to study medication. 
• 
In addition to the subjects above, the Sponsor is aware of the death of another subject 424-1001, 
which occurred more than 28 days after discontinuation from OLE Study RPC01-3001. This subject 
had SAE of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma on Study Day 124 (1,135 days after the first dose of 
ozanimod) that was considered unlikely to be related to study drug by the investigator and Sponsor. 
The investigator was not able to attribute the death as an outcome of this SAE, and the death was 
not recorded as an on-study event. 
Two deaths during the IBD Studies: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 141/188 
 
 
 
•  A middle-aged female (age ranging 40-50 years) subject with UC who received ozanimod 0.5 mg for 
approximately  32  weeks  in  Study  RPC01-202  and  ozanimod  1  mg  for  approximately  863  days  in 
RP01-202OLP, discontinued study drug due to adenocarcinoma. On study ALC levels were <0.5 x 
109/L on Study Day 830. The subject died in the hospital from mucinous adenocarcinoma (of gastric, 
pancreatic,  bilial,  or  endometrial  [intestinal  type]  origin)  on  open-label  extension  Study  Day  911. 
The  event  was  considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  The  Sponsor 
considered the event to be unrelated to study drug. 
•  A  young  female  (age  ranging  20-30  years)  subject  with  CD  who  received  ozanimod  1  mg  for 
approximately 11 months in Study RPC01-2201, discontinued study drug to allow initiation of high-
dose corticosteroid for treatment of worsening Crohn’s disease on Study Day 330. The subject was 
hospitalized due to the worsening Crohn’s disease on Study Day 338 and died in the hospital from 
complications of worsening Crohn’s disease (duodenal fistula, sepsis) on Study Day 361. Even though 
the  SDEI  was  stated  as  serious  or  opportunistic  infection,  this  could  not  have  been  confirmed  in 
retrospect. The event was considered to be possibly related to study drug by the investigator. The 
Sponsor considered the event to be unrelated to study drug. 
Note for the purpose of the PPD protection, ranges of ages were included in the EPAR instead of individual 
ages of subjects. 
To conclude, two cases are suspect of a suicidal context, two cases might involve immunosuppressant 
properties  of  ozanimod  leading  to  infections,  and  two  cases  of  death  were  reported  in  the  context  of 
malignancies. Although, no common pattern of adverse events of special interest known for ozanimod 
could be derived from the seven death cases, at least a contribution of ozanimod could not be ruled out. 
Laboratory findings 
Absolute Lymphocyte Count 
A dose-dependent reduction in ALC from baseline of approximately 50% to 70% is associated with clinical 
efficacy in RMS (Subei, 2015). The lymphocyte count was reduced as early as from Week 4 in the phase 
2 study on, reaching a maximum decrease at Month 3 after treatment initiation. Mean ALC reductions 
from baseline were 53.5% to 57.4% for subjects on ozanimod 1 mg and 40.9% to 45.8% for subjects 
on ozanimod 0.5 mg in Pool A1. Mean actual ALC values were (and remained) below lower limit of normal 
starting at Month 3 (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Mean (SE) Absolute Lymphocyte Count by Visit – Pool A1 (Safety Population) 
ALC = Absolute lymphocyte count; BL = baseline, IFN = interferon; M = month; RCP 1063 = ozanimod HCl; SE = standard error 
The number of subjects with an ALC <0.2 x 109/L was higher in the 1 mg ozanimod group (n=29, 3.3%) 
than in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group (n=4, 0.4%) and the IFN β-1a group (0) in Pool A1 (5.5% of patients 
treated with ozanimod 1 mg in Pool B). The majority of these subjects (22/29 [75.9%] in the ozanimod 
1 mg group and 3/4 [75%] in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group) recovered to levels ≥0.2 x 109/L while on 
treatment.  As  indicated  in  the  AESI  section  on  “infections”,  ALC  values  of  <0.2  x  109/L  were  not 
associated  with  serious  infections.  Adequate  warning  wording  has  been  included  in  SmPC  section  4.4 
(“infections”)  to  reflect  threshold  ALC  values  to  prompt  therapeutic  action  as  well  as  precautionary 
measures. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that prolonged lymphocyte count decreases will translate 
into an increased risk for acquiring serious or opportunistic infections in rare cases. 
Lymphocyte counts collected from approximately 200 subjects following discontinuation of study drug 
allowed  for  a  post  hoc  assessment  of  off-treatment  recovery  of  ALC.  Based  on  the  KM  estimate,  the 
median  time  to  recovery  of  ALC  to  the  normal  range  (≥  1  x  109/L)  was  30  days  after  treatment 
discontinuation in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 28 days after treatment discontinuation in 
the ozanimod 0.5 mg treatment group (Figure 11).

In the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group, approximately 80% of subjects recovered to the normal range

months after treatment discontinuation. In the ozanimod 0.5 mg treatment group, approximately 80% 
of subjects recovered to the normal range approximately 35 days after treatment discontinuation and 
approximately 90% of subjects recovered to the normal range 2 months after treatment discontinuation 
Liver Function Tests (see section on Hepatic effects) 
Other Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Despite  dose-dependent  mean  decreases  in  leukocytes  (in  line  with  decreases  in  lymphocyte  counts) 
and  basophiles  as  well  as  mean  increases  in  monocytes  and  respective  abnormalities  in  pre-defined 
threshold values for these parameters, no other concerns emerged on haematology values. The incidence 
of AEs related to haematology parameters was overall low. None was serious or led to discontinuation 
of the drug. 
Modest, dose-dependent, non-progressive increases from baseline in total cholesterol and low-density 
lipoprotein levels were observed at Month 3 with ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg relative to IFN β-1a. These 
changes were accompanied by corresponding increases in high-density lipoprotein and no meaningful 
changes  in  triglyceride  levels.  No  concomitant  increases  in  cardiac-related  AEs  were  noted  with 
cholesterol changes. 
No  clinically  meaningful  trends  in  changes  from  baseline  in  other  chemistry  parameters  or  urinalysis 
parameters were observed for any treatment group. 
Safety in special populations 
The effects of age, sex, race, region, BMI, smoking status and prior use of DMT on the incidence of AEs 
and SAEs were examined for subjects in Pool A1. The overall incidence and type of AEs for ozanimod 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 144/188 
 
 
 
 
 
versus IFN β-1a within each subgroup were generally consistent with those of the overall population and 
did not reveal any clinically relevant concerns in any subgroup.  
Age 
In each treatment group, the ratio of subjects≤ 40 years old versus > 40 years old was approximately 
2:1 (ozanimod 1 mg: 621 versus 261; ozanimod 0.5 mg: 615 versus 277; IFN β-1a: 614 versus 271). 
The incidence of AEs was similar in subjects ≤ 40 years of age and subjects > 40 years of age in all 3 
treatment groups (ozanimod 1 mg: 65.1% versus 72.0%; ozanimod 0.5 mg: 64.4% versus 68.2%; IFN 
β-1a: 79.6% versus 78.2%) and did not reveal any clinically relevant concerns with ozanimod treatment. 
In  both  age  subgroups,  the  predominant  SOCs  were  infections  and  infestations  and  nervous  system 
disorders.  
There was a higher incidence of SAEs in subjects > 40 years of age than subjects ≤ 40 years of age in 
all 3 treatment groups (ozanimod 1 mg: 6.5% versus 3.9%; ozanimod 0.5 mg: 7.9% versus 4.1%; IFN 
β-1a: 7.4% versus 3.1%). This difference was not attributable to any particular SOC(s).  
Within age subgroups, the overall incidence of TEAEs and SAEs was similar across the treatment groups. 
A higher incidence of hepatic SDEIs was observed among subjects > 40 years old in the ozanimod 1 mg 
and 0.5 mg treatment groups, relative to IFN β-1a (13.8%, 11.2%, 5.2%, respectively), than among 
subjects ≤ 40 years of age (10.1%, 8.0%, 6.2%, respectively). Reductions in ALC to < 0.2 x 109/L were 
more frequently observed in subjects > 40 years old than ≤ 40 years old in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment 
group  (6.5%  versus  1.9%,  respectively),  but  not  the  ozanimod  0.5  mg  treatment  group  (0.7%  and 
0.3%, respectively) or IFN β-1a treatment group (no cases in either subgroup). 
Subjects >55 years of age were excluded from studies contributing to Pool A1. As reported before, an 
additional analysis of clinical safety data of these 161 patients included in Pool B were provided by the 
Applicant.  The  limited  number  of  patients  >55  years  of  age  generally  exhibited  a  higher  incidence  of 
TEAEs in contrast to patients ≤55 years. The most remarkable differences were found for liver function 
test abnormalities (ALT increased and GGT increased) and cardiovascular – related TEAEs (hypertension 
and orthostatic hypotension).  
Sex 
Population PK analysis showed that CC112273 steady-state exposure in males was approximately 35% 
lower compared to females. In each treatment group, the ratio of female subjects to male subjects was 
approximately  2:1  (ozanimod  1  mg:  576  to  306;  ozanimod  0.5  mg:  598  versus  294;  IFN  β-1a:  602 
versus 283). 
There was a higher incidence of AEs among female subjects compared to male subjects in the ozanimod 
1  mg  and  IFN  β-1a  treatment  groups  (Table  31),  which  was  attributable  to  events  in  the  psychiatric 
disorders,  nervous  system  disorders,  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  SOCs.  The  incidence  of  AEs  was 
similar  between  female  and  male  subjects  in  the  ozanimod  0.5  mg  treatment  group.  Within  the 
subgroups of female and male subjects, the relative differences across treatment groups in the incidence 
of  AEs  were  similar.  Imbalances  between  gender  subgroups  were  likely  due  to  the  natural  history  of 
specific AEs or to a chance finding from rare AEs.

Table 31: Incidences of Frequently reported TEAEs, Frequently reported SAEs and SDEIs by 
sex – Pool A1 
AE = Adverse event, ALC = Absolute lymphocyte count, IFN = Interferon, TEAE = Treatment-emergent adverse event, SAE = Serious 
adverse event, SDEI Sponsor-designated events of interest  
The incidence of SAEs was low and slightly higher among female than male subjects in the ozanimod 1 
mg and the IFN β-1a group, while for subjects in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group, the incidence of SAEs was 
lower  in  female  subjects  than  in  male  subjects.    Among  the  SDEIs,  the  incidence  of  serious  and 
opportunistic infections were generally comparable across the treatment groups in both male and female 
subjects  (Table  32).  All  cases  of  herpes  zoster  or  Varicella  zoster  virus  infection  in  the  ozanimod 
treatment  groups  occurred  in  female  subjects;  however,  this  is  consistent  with  the  epidemiologic 
literature (Fleming, 2003). All malignancies (except 1 case of testicular seminoma [pure] stage I) were 
reported in female subjects. The overall low incidence of malignancies and the disproportionate gender 
distribution in clinical MS studies did not allow a meaningful conclusion. ALC reductions to <0.2 x 109/L 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020

occurred predominantly in females. Pulmonary SDEIs in the ozanimod treatment groups occurred at a 
higher incidence relative to IFN β-1a in male subjects as compared to female subjects. This was driven 
mainly by PFT abnormalities.  
The  incidence  of  liver  enzyme  elevations,  primarily  ALT  and  GGT,  as  well  as  the  incidence  of  hepatic 
SDEIs was significantly higher in males (twice as high) as compared to females as discussed in previous 
section.  
Race 
For Pool A1, the vast majority of subjects were white (approximately 99%); therefore, due to the small 
sample  size  of  the  non-white  subgroup,  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn  regarding  the  difference  in  the 
overall incidence of AEs between the white and non-white race groups. 
Region 
No reliable conclusions can be drawn for TEAE incidences in different regions given that 90% of patients 
were from Eastern Europe and only 10% from countries included in the group of rest-of-the world. 
Body Mass Index 
The  vast  majority  (~90%)  of  subjects  had  a  BMI  <  30  kg/m2  as  compared  to  ≥  30  kg/m2  in  all  3 
treatment groups (ozanimod 1 mg: 784 versus 97; ozanimod 0.5 mg: 812 versus 79; IFN β-1a: 788 
versus 97). Comparisons between BMI subgroups should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively 
smaller population of subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. 
The incidence of AEs was higher in subjects with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 than in subjects with a BMI < 30 
kg/m2 in the ozanimod treatment groups (ozanimod 1 mg: 82.5% versus 65.2%; ozanimod 0.5 mg: 
78.5%  versus  64.3%)  and  was  similar  between  the  BMI  subgroups  in  the  IFN  β-1a  treatment  group 
(79.4%  versus  79.2%).  There  were  no  differences  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  between  the  ozanimod 
treatment groups within either BMI category.  
Overall, the pattern of AEs reported by BMI subgroup was generally consistent with the overall population 
and did not reveal any clinically relevant concerns with ozanimod treatment. Ozanimod-treated subjects 
with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had a higher incidence of orthostatic hypotension (both treatment groups) and 
hypertension  (ozanimod  1  mg  only)  compared  with  subjects  with  BMI  <30  kg/m2.  The  incidence  of 
orthostatic hypotension was 8.2% and 11.4% for subjects with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 in the ozanimod 1 mg 
and ozanimod 0.5 mg groups, respectively, compared with 3.8% and 2.8%, respectively, for subjects 
with BMI < 30 kg/m2. This increase was not observed for subjects in the IFN β-1a group (1.0% for BMI 
≥30  kg/m2  and  3.4%  for  BMI  <30  kg/m2).  The  incidence  of  hypertension  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg 
treatment group was 12.4% in subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and 2.3% in subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2. 
Such an increase was not observed for subjects in the ozanimod 0.5 mg treatment group (2.5% for BMI 
≥30 kg/m2 and 3.6% for BMI <30 kg/m2) or the IFN β-1a group (3.1% for BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and 1.9% 
for BMI <30 kg/m2).  
The incidence of SAEs among subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was lowest in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment 
group  (3.1%  versus  5.1%  and  5.2%  in  the  ozanimod  0.5  mg  and  IFN  β-1a  treatment  groups, 
respectively) and was similar across the treatment groups among subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2 (4.8%, 
5.3%, and 4.3%, respectively).

The overall incidence and type of AEs and SAEs for ozanimod versus IFN β-1a among current and not 
current smokers were generally consistent with those of the overall population and did not reveal any 
clinically relevant concerns with ozanimod treatment.

Prior Disease-modifying Therapy 
Approximately 30% of subjects in each treatment group had a history of prior DMT use, most commonly 
glatiramer acetate, IFN β-1a, or IFN β-1b. 
The overall incidence and type of AEs  and SAEs for  ozanimod versus IFN β-1a for subjects with prior 
DMT use was generally consistent with the overall population and did not reveal any clinically relevant 
concerns with ozanimod treatment. There was a slightly higher incidence of Infections and Infestations 
AEs in ozanimod-treated subjects with prior DMT use compared with DMT-naïve subjects (1 mg: 39.7% 
versus  33.3%,  respectively;  0.5  mg:  39.2%  versus  31.6%,  respectively)  but  not  in  the  IFN  β-1a 
treatment group (33.3% versus 35.0%, respectively). These differences were not driven by serious or 
opportunistic  infections.  This  finding  is  also  in  line  with  data  from  S1P  modulators  leading  to  specific 
warnings  in  the  respective  SmPC  on  prior  immunosuppressive  treatments.  Nearly  all  evaluated  ALC 
abnormalities or adverse events deriving thereof for ozanimod 1 mg showed a numerical difference in 
their occurrence at the expense of patients with prior DMT treatment reported. The difference, however, 
was  small  and  did  not  point  towards  a  generally  different  safety  profile  in  patients  with  previous 
immunomodulating therapy. 
Hepatic Impairment Study 
Study RPC01-1904 was a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study to characterize the PK and safety of 
a single 0.25 mg dose of ozanimod in 16 subjects with mild (n=8) or moderate (n=8) hepatic impairment 
and 15 healthy matched subjects with normal hepatic function.  
No dose adjustment is deemed necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh  class  A  and  B)  based  on  a  total  of  16  subjects  (8  with  mild  and  8  with  moderate  impairment) 
treated  with  a  single  0.25 mg  dose  of  ozanimod  and  compared  to  15  healthy  matched  controls  from 
study RPC01-1904. The exposure in this study is much lower than the recommended therapeutic dose 
of 1 mg daily. Nevertheless, a single-dose PK study using 0.25 mg ozanimod to evaluate the effect of 
hepatic impairment is adequate to extrapolate to the recommended 1 mg once-daily maintenance dose 
as per the CHMP “Guideline on The Evaluation of The Pharmacokinetics of Medicinal Products in Patients 
with Impaired Hepatic Function” (CPMP/EWP/2339/02). Even though, based on this limited data, it could 
not be excluded that patients with mild to moderate liver impairment treated with therapeutic doses of 
ozanimod  could  have  more  frequent  or  more  severe  adverse  events  with  long-term  exposure,  risk 
mitigation  with  the  addition  of  routine  monitoring  of  transaminase  and  bilirubin  levels  is  thought  to 
mitigate  the  risk  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  A  and  B). 
Moreover,  ‘Severe  liver  impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  C)’  is  listed  as  a  contraindication  given  that 
ozanimod was not studied in this subpopulation. 
Renal Impairment Study 
Study  RPC01-1906  (Renal  Impairment)  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label  study  to  characterize  the  PK  and 
safety of a single 0.25 mg dose of ozanimod in 8 subjects with ESRD with or without haemodialysis and 
8  matched  healthy  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  Subjects  with  normal  renal  function  were 
matched by body weight (± 20%) and age (± 10 years) to subjects with ESRD.  
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  systemic  exposures  of  ozanimod  and  CC112273  in 
subjects with ESRD compared with their matched healthy subjects. Subjects were followed for 4 days, 
with a follow-up phone call 6 days after discharge. Two subjects (25.0%) with ESRD reported a total of 
6 AEs and 1 subject (12.5%) with normal renal function reported 1 AE. The most frequently reported 
AEs were headache and nausea, each reported in 2 subjects with ESRD. There were no AEs leading to 
death, SAEs, or AEs resulting in discontinuation of the study or study drug. Based on this trial, renal 
impairment had no clinically important effects on pharmacokinetics of ozanimod or its main metabolite 
CC112273. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Fertility study assessments in the rat had a NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day, corresponding to > 240 times the 
exposure at the MRHD for ozanimod and the active metabolites (across species). In the embryo-foetal 
development  study,  findings  at  higher  dose  levels  included  embryo-foetal  death,  abnormal/delayed 
ossification,  and  abnormalities  of  the  viscera  and  large  blood  vessels.  Pre-  and  post-natal  effects  of 
ozanimod evaluated in rats induced no abnormalities in either the parental females of F1 generation.  
Ozanimod is excreted in the milk of ozanimod-treated rats. 
Of  note,  during  the  entire  clinical  program,  48  pregnancies  (38  subject  pregnancies  and  10  partner 
pregnancies)  were  reported  as  of  the  cut-off  date  (30  Jun  2018).  All  pregnancy  exposures  for  study 
subjects occurred during the first trimester and subjects discontinued study medication promptly, with 
the exception that some subjects who elected termination and did not discontinue study medication. Of 
the 38 subject pregnancies, 23 resulted in a live birth of healthy infants (1 with late intrauterine growth 
retardation  with  subsequent  normal  progress),  5  resulted  in  spontaneous  early  loss,  8  subjects 
underwent elective abortion, and 2 subjects had not yet delivered. The incidence of spontaneous early 
loss  (5/38  [~13%])  is  within  the  known  rate  of  miscarriage  in  the  general  population  (García-
Enguídanos, 2002). 
Contraindication for the use of ozanimod during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not 
using effective contraception was added in section 4.3 of the SmPC. With reference to the non-clinical 
consideration  and  experience  with  the  related  S1P  modulator 
fingolimod  (EMEA/H/C/2202-
PSUSA/00001393/201902), sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC and corresponding sections of the PL were 
reviewed.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In study RPC01-1902, itraconazole as a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 resulted in no clinically meaningful 
changes in exposure of ozanimod, CC112273 and CC1084037 and decreased the exposure to RP101075 
by approximately 25%. Rifampin (strong inducer of CYP3A and moderate inducer of CYP2C8) resulted 
in  minor  effects  on  the  AUCs  of  ozanimod  but  reduced  the  exposure  for  ozanimod,  CC112273,  and 
CC1084037 by approximately 24%, 60%, and 55%, respectively. Reduction in exposure to the two main 
active metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 is due to CYP2C8 induction effect. A single subject was 
reported with second-degree AV block while being treated with a single dose of ozanimod 1 mg. Adverse 
events reported in this trial were in line with adverse events reported with a single ozanimod 1 mg dose 
(i.e. AV block) and did not suggest an increased risk following CYP3A4 inhibition/ induction. 
In study RPC01-1903, ciclosporin as strong inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP was found to increase exposure 
of precursor metabolites of the two main active metabolites. Thus, an increase in exposure to the active 
metabolites  could  not  be  excluded.  Although,  no  specific  safety  concerns  were  noted  with 
coadministration of single doses of ciclosporin and ozanimod, the theoretical risk of increased exposure 
was included in SmPC section 4.5.  
Oral contraceptives are frequently prescribed in female MS patients. In a dedicated DDI study (RPC01-
1907), co-administration of ozanimod with a single oral contraceptive dose (combined ethinylestradiol 
and norethindrone), did not alter the PK of either component. Thus, the efficacy of the oral contraceptive 
is not expected to be altered with ozanimod treatment.

Interactions with cardiac drugs were evaluated using steady-state beta blocker propranolol and calcium 
channel  clocker  diltiazem  (RPC01-1908).  No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  the  PK  of  ozanimod, 
RP101988, and RP101075 were observed when a single dose of ozanimod 0.25 mg was coadministered 
with steady-state propranolol or diltiazem. No meaningful changes were observed in cardiac parameters 
(i.e.  heart  rate  or  PR  interval)  compared  to  either drug  alone.  No  cardiac-related  AEs  were  reported. 
Study RPC01-1912 was conducted to evaluate the effect of inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 or CYP3A 
on the exposure of CC112273 and CC1084037. Gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, had no effect 
on the exposure of ozanimod while it increased the exposure (AUClast) of CC112273 and CC1084037 by 
approximately  47%  and  69%,  respectively.  No  cardiac-related  or  other  significant  AEs  were  reported 
from  coadministration  of  a  single  pseudoephedrine  dose  with  repeated  ozanimod  doses  in  study 
RPC01-1914.  Co-administration  of  ozanimod  QD  over  30  days  with  a  single  dose  of  pseudoephedrine 
60 mg  on  Day  30  did  not  potentiate  the  pseudoephedrine-induced  BP  response.  However,  ozanimod 
increased a pseudoephedrine-induced HR change by approximately 3 bpm, which is adequately reflected 
in section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
The two main active metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 are selective inhibitors of MAO-B; therefore, 
DDI are to be expected after simultaneous administration of ozanimod with serotonergic (i.e. selective 
serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRI),  serotonin–norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRI),  etc.)  or 
sympathomimetic medications. Inhibition of MAO-B increases serotonin in the synaptic cleft, which sets 
the  patient  at  risk  for  potentially  life-threatening  serotonin  syndrome.  Standardised  MedDRA  queries 
(based  on  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  as  SMQ)  based  on  Pool  D  data  did  not  reveal  cases  of 
serotonin  syndrome; by  application of  a  broader  search  strategy,  5  of  6  subjects  had  such  SAEs  in a 
timely  context  to  initiation  of  serotonergic  medication.  When  restricted  to  concomitant  use  of  SSRI  / 
SNRI  (Pool  A1),  an  increased  incidence  of  TEAEs  (driven  by  hypertension)  in  subjects  on  ozanimod 
compared to IFN β-1a, was reported after initiation of these drugs. Further analyses in Pool D found no 
significant  difference  on  the  incidence  of  serotonin  syndrome  extended  broad  SMQ  TEAEs  in  patients 
treated with ozanimod after initialization of SSRI or SNRI concomitant medications (and without such 
medication). This finding was supported by clinical pharmacology studies and preclinical studies. 
No  specific  concerns  are  to  be  raised  on  concomitantly  administered  sympathomimetic  medications, 
cardiovascular medications, and steroid treatment, based on overall TEAE reporting rates after initiation 
of these drugs compared to IFN β-1a. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  incidence  of  discontinuations  from  study  drug  due  to  AEs  was  low  in  Pool  A1  with  slightly  more 
subjects having discontinued from IFN β-1a as compared to ozanimod (3.8% IFN β-1a, 2.4% ozanimod 
0.5 mg, 2.9% ozanimod 1 mg). This was due to events of influenza like illness (1.4% of subjects on IFN 
β-1a vs. none in the ozanimod groups). The incidence of AESIs leading to discontinuation of ozanimod 
was low and included ≤3 subjects per treatment group with hepatic enzyme elevations (ALT increased, 
GGT  increased,  liver  function  test  abnormal,  AST  increased),  single  cases  of  macular  oedema  (≤  3 
subjects per group) and bradycardia (2 subjects on ozanimod 0.5 mg only). The pattern and incidences 
of TEAEs leading to discontinuation did not change with longer-term exposure to ozanimod (Pool B). Pool 
C differed from what has been reported for the RMS studies in that the underlying IBD dominated the 
reasons for drug discontinuations. 
More patients on IFN β-1a withdrew from study as compared to patients in either ozanimod group (4.1% 
vs.  2.6%  total  ozanimod).  There  was  no  SOCs  or  PTs  for  ozanimod that  was  significantly  affected  by 
study  withdrawals  as  compared  to  IFN  β-1a  (influenza-like  illness).  No  changes  in  the  pattern  and 
incidence of TEAEs leading to study withdrawal could be deduced from Pool B.

Dose  interruptions  due  to  TEAEs  were  infrequently  reported  for  all  treatment  groups  and  highest  for 
ozanimod 0.5 mg (2.8%), while ALT and AST increased were the most frequently reported reasons.

N/A 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Zeposia (ozanimod), an S1P1 and S1P5 agonist, was evaluated for the treatment of adult patients with 
RRMS with a recommended daily dosage of 1 mg. Experience with other S1P receptor modulators led to 
give particular attention to prespecified AEs of special interest that represent potential safety concerns 
and  to  an  initial  dose  escalation  regimen  of  ozanimod,  which  was  actually  successful  in  decreasing 
potential first-dose chronotropic and dromotropic effects.  
The safety profile of ozanimod has been examined in a clinical development program including a subject 
population of more than 3,400 with over 8000 person-years of follow-up in RMS and IBD, including 2,765 
subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg for more than 1 year, 1,226 treated for more than 2 years, and 
613 treated for more than 3 years. Only 88 patients from phase 2 Study RPC01-201A were exposed to 
placebo and 65 patients from the IBD Study RPC01-202, thus limiting comparative conclusions. 
Available data suggested that the overall safety profile of ozanimod initiated with a dose titration regimen 
was at least not worse when compared to other S1P receptor modulators without initial dose escalation 
regimen, including the short and long-term cardiovascular effects. Overall the safety database seemed 
to be adequate for the proposed target population of patients with RRMS. Nevertheless, safety data for 
patients over 55 years, pregnant and lactating women, patients with hepatic impairment as well as for 
the paediatric population was limited or even missing.  
Specifically,  no  controlled  safety  data  was  available  for  RMS  patients  >55  years  of  age,  which  was 
depicted in the posology section 4.2 of the SmPC. However, the rate of TEAEs in subjects >40 years of 
age  was  consistently  higher  as  compared  to  <40  years,  while  the  group  of  subjects  >40  years  was 
restricted to subjects up to 55 years of age based on study inclusion criteria; the susceptibility for AEs 
could be expected to be higher in older subjects.  As of the 31 Jan 2019 safety data cut-off date for the 
US FDA 4MSU, there were 161 subjects who had turned >55 years of age during the study (Pool B). The 
limited additional safety data for subjects > 55 years did not indicate a worse safety profile of ozanimod 
in  the  elderly  that  would  lead  to  a  different  perception  of  the  benefit-risk  profile.  However,  no  firm 
conclusion could be made with regard to long-term safety in the elderly based on the limited number of 
elderly subjects being evaluated in clinical trials so far. This is reflected in the posology section of the 
SmPC. 
Embryofoetal  toxicity  in  exposed  pregnant  women  is  an  important  potential  risk  supported  by  the 
established role of the S1P1 receptor in vasculogenesis (Ben Shoham et al., 2012; Pyne, 2017) and cases 
of abnormal foetal development in the post-marketing setting of the related S1P modulator fingolimod 
(Karlsson  et al.,  2014).  In  reproduction  toxicity  studies  with  ozanimod,  embryolethality  and 
teratogenicity  were  evident  in  rats  and  rabbits  at  exposures  similar  or  below  those  in  humans 
administered 1 mg ozanimod. Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study population 
throughout the clinical development program. Therefore, section 4.6 of the SmPC was updated to state 
that women of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment 
to ensure that they are not pregnant and must use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 
months after stopping ozanimod, which was considered adequate. The CHMP also agreed to the proposed 
educational materials for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and a patient wallet card that will be distributed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 151/188 
 
 
 
by HCPs to females of childbearing potential as additional risk minimisation measures. Experience in the 
post-marketing  setting  for  both  proposed  ORION  study  and  from  spontaneous  reporting  will  provide 
further  long-term  sources  of  information.  Although  it  could  be  accepted  the  explanation  to  keep  the 
safety concern “Embryofoetal toxicity in exposed pregnant females” as important potential risk in the 
RMP, essentially due to the lack of clinical data, CHMP was of the opinion that in order to further minimize 
the  safety  concern  of  ‘embryofoetal  toxicity’  the  administration  of  ozanimod  during  pregnancy  and  in 
women  of  child-bearing  potential  not  using  effective  contraception  needed  to  be  reflected  as  a 
contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC. Additionally, whilst ozanimod and metabolites are excreted 
in animal milk, it is not known whether excretion occurs in human milk, albeit it is expected. The human 
neonate might therefore be exposed to ozanimod and susceptible to the adverse effect profile observed 
in adults or unspecified developmental effects. For this reason, the Applicant proposed to not recommend 
use in breast-feeding women. Nonetheless, in accordance with the currently approved instructions of the 
S1P  modulator  fingolimod  (EMEA/H/C/2202/II/53),  a  more  restrictive  wording  was  finally  included  in 
section 4.6: “Zeposia should not be used during breast-feeding”. Additionally, The Applicant will provide 
any  reports  of  neonatal  exposure  in  the  post-marketing  setting  in  the  periodic  safety  update  report 
(PSUR). 
Ozanimod was well tolerated, with a low rate of discontinuation and a similar incidence of SAEs in the 
Phase 3 RMS program across treatment groups (4.6%, 5.3%, and 4.4% in the ozanimod 1 mg, ozanimod 
0.5 mg, and IFN β-1a groups, respectively). There was no evidence of cumulative toxicity with ozanimod. 
The adverse events (based on PT), which were reported more frequently with ozanimod than IFN β-1a 
(defined  as  more  than  a  1%  difference)  occurred  dose-related  for  ALT  increased,  GGT  increased, 
orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, respiratory tract infection viral, and abdominal 
pain upper. In general, the pattern and incidences of AEs leading to discontinuation did not change with 
long-term exposure to ozanimod. The pattern and incidence of adverse events was similar for Pools A 
and B, with the exception of TEAEs of lymphopenia (7.4%), lymphocyte count decreased (5.9%), and 
leukopenia (1%), which were only reported for ozanimod 1 mg in Pool B (i.e. the dose administered in 
the open-label studies). These adverse events were not reported in the controlled parts of the studies 
(Pool  A1)  in  order  to  keep  the  investigator  blinded.  Moreover,  symptomatic  lymphopenia  was  not 
reported in the phase 3 studies. The overall safety profile of the 2 tested doses of ozanimod was similar 
with the exception of: frequency of ALC<0.2 x 109/L, which was greater for the 1 mg versus the 0.5 mg 
dose (3.3% versus 0.4 %), and increased frequency of liver function test elevations (>3 x ULN for ALT) 
with the 1 mg versus the 0.5 mg (5.5% versus 3.8%).  
The approach of defining adverse drug reactions in order to inform section 4.8 of the SmPC was deemed 
acceptable and further complemented by ADRs as requested during the course of this procedure. The 
following ADRs have been defined: 
•  Very common: nasopharyngitis, lymphopenia 
•  Common:  pharyngitis,  respiratory  tract  infection  viral,  urinary  tract  infection,  bradycardia, 
hypertension,  orthostatic  hypotension,  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  gamma-glutamyl 
transferase increased, blood bilirubin increased, pulmonary function test abnormal 
•  Uncommon: Herpes zoster, hypersensitivity (including rash and urticaria), macular oedema 
Overall,  treatment  initiation  of  ozanimod  without  post-dose  observation  was  supported  to  be  safe  in 
patients with normal cardiac status. With dose escalation at initiation of ozanimod treatment, a minimal 
reduction in mean HR with a nadir at Hour 5, with return towards baseline by Hour 6 was associated 
with Ozanimod. Second-degree AV blocks type I were solely reported in the phase 2 study by 24-h Holter 
monitoring and similar in subjects on placebo and ozanimod 0.25 mg on Day 1. No second-degree AV 
block type II or higher was reported in clinical RMS studies with ozanimod. No additional effects on heart 
rate or AV conduction were observed with chronic ozanimod dosing. TEAEs reported on Day 1 of dose

escalation (bradycardias in 0.5% of subjects on ozanimod vs. 0 on IFN β-1a) subsided thereafter. SDEI 
including cardiac monitoring abnormalities as well as cardiac-related TEAEs were driven by a reduced HR 
during the initial 6 hours of monitoring on Day 1. No effects on QT interval were identified in preclinical 
and clinical studies, including a designated TQT study 
Subjects with certain pre-existing cardiovascular conditions were only eligible to participate in the active-
controlled Phase 3 RMS studies if the event occurred more than 6 months prior to screening. Additionally, 
patients  with  HR<  55  bpm  at  screening  were  not  eligible  and  the  use  of  concomitant  treatment  with 
medications with a known impact on the cardiac conduction system was not permitted during the study. 
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  clarified  that  a  limited  number  of  patients  entered  the  Phase  3 
controlled studies with a pre-existing cardiovascular condition, baseline HR < 55 bpm, prolonged baseline 
QTcF or medications known to impact cardiac conduction. Based on this post hoc analysis, while these 
patients  had  a  higher  incidence  of  first-dose  bradycardias,  an  increase  in  cardiac  events  and  QT 
prolongation  during  maintenance  treatment  was  not  observed.  Overall,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  in 
patients  with  underlying  cardiac  disease  or  concomitant  medication  affecting  heart  rhythm  and/or 
conduction,  a  more  cautious  approach  was  needed.  As  stated  in  section  4.4  of  SmPC,  first  dose 
monitoring and/or additional 6 hours post-dose observation period on Day 1 was recommended for these 
patients. Moreover, cardiologist advice was required for some pre-existing cardiac conditions, as well as 
for patients concomitantly treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Specifically, concomitant administration of 
class  Ia  or  class  III  antiarrhythmics  was  not  investigated  and  might  worsen  the  cardiac  safety  of 
ozanimod  (see  section  4.4  of  SmPC).  Moreover,  patients  with  MI  (myocardial  infarction),  unstable 
angina, stroke, transitory ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization 
or Class III/IV heart failure during 6 months prior to ozanimod initiation as well as patients with history 
or presence of second-degree AV block Type II or third-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome severe 
untreated sleep apnea should not receive ozanimod in line with contraindication stated in section 4.3 of 
SmPC.  
Also, in line with known class effects, small increases in SBP and DBP were noted during treatment with 
ozanimod starting approximately after 3 months of treatment, which remained roughly constant over 24 
months  of  observation  in  Pool  A1.  The  increase  in  blood  pressure  was  reflected  by  more  TEAEs  of 
hypertension in the ozanimod 1 mg group compared to IFN β-1a group (4.5% vs. 2.3%). A warning on 
blood  pressure  changes  was  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  Moreover,  subjects  with  post-hoc 
defined  uncontrolled  hypertension  were  not  observed  to  have  had  worsening  of  hypertension  during 
ozanimod treatment (6 patients were treated for 3 to 5 years). 
Prior to initiation of therapy it is recommended to obtain baseline liver function tests. While elevations 
in  hepatic  tests  were  common,  these  were  generally  asymptomatic  and  resolved  with  continued 
treatment. TEAEs from the hepatobiliary disorders SOC were mainly driven by liver enzyme increases; 
however, (non-serious) events of hepatitis and hepatitis toxic were reported in 6 subjects on ozanimod 
and in only one subject on IFN β-1a. Almost all of these subjects had a history of hepatic disorder or 
baseline  liver  enzyme  abnormalities.  No  patient  developed  liver  failure.  Ten  patients  were  suspect  of 
having  met  Hy’s  law  criteria  for  hepatotoxicity  during  treatment  with  ozanimod  (Pool  D),  but  hepatic 
experts did not confirm Hy’s law after review. During the procedure, the Applicant proposed routine liver 
monitoring, including time intervals, retesting and thresholds for treatment discontinuation to prevent 
significant drug-induced liver injury based on clinical trials’ protocols and results. The incidence of liver 
enzyme elevations, primarily ALT and GGT, as well as the incidence of hepatic SDEIs was significantly 
higher in males (twice as high) as compared to females, an effect known for S1P receptor modulators. 
Regarding  patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  no  dose  adjustment  was  deemed  necessary  for  patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B) based on a total of 16 subjects (8 
with  mild  and  8  with  moderate  impairment)  treated  with  a  single  0.25 mg  dose  of  ozanimod  and 
compared  to  15  healthy  matched  controls.  However,  the  absence  of  adverse  effects  after  a  single 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 153/188 
 
 
 
0.25 mg dose in the hepatic impairment study RPC01-1904 in subjects with Child-Pugh class A and B is 
not reassuring for the absence of a risk with the higher 1 mg maintenance dose in clinical practice. The 
extent of worsening in patients with pre-existing liver impairment remains unknown given that subjects 
with  defined  pre-existing  hepatic  conditions,  including  chronic  hepatic  impairment  or  liver  enzymes/ 
bilirubin ≥1.5x ULN that were excluded from clinical studies. The use of ozanimod in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (i.e. Child-Pugh class C) was added as a contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
The decrease in ALC due to ozanimod is dose-dependent and may increase susceptibility to infections. 
Clinical trials revealed that in the recommended dose of 1 mg of ozanimod, ALC values <0.5x109/L and 
<0.2 x 109/L  were  found  in  54.7%  and  in  3.3%  of  subjects  versus  1.6%  and  none  in  IFN  β-1a, 
respectively.  There  was  no  difference  either  in  the  incidence  of  infection  TEAEs,  serious  infections, 
infections  leading  to  discontinuation  and  serious or  opportunistic  infections  reported  in  the  context of 
SDEI  between  ozanimod  and  IFN  β-1a  in  Pool  A1.  Although  serious  or  opportunistic  infections  were 
generally not associated with concurrent ALC values <0.2 x 109/L, the long-term risk under real-world 
treatment  conditions  cannot  be  predicted.  Section  4.4  has  been  amended  to  reflect  precautionary 
measures as well as threshold ALC values prompting therapeutic action. 
Slightly more Herpes zoster infections/ varicella zoster virus infections occurred in subjects on ozanimod 
(0.4% for total ozanimod) compared to IFN β-1a (0.2%) in Pool A1 and tended to increase with longer 
treatment  duration  in  Pool  B  (1.2%  for  total  ozanimod).  The  SmPC  adequately  informs  on  the 
recommendation for a Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) vaccination in patients without documented immunity 
to VZV before initiation of ozanimod. 
No case of systemic opportunistic infections including PML was reported with ozanimod treatment up to 
68  months.  However,  absence  of  systemic  opportunistic  infections  should  be  interpreted  with  caution 
given the short-term exposure of a limited number of patients in the ozanimod program. As such, EMA 
has been informed by the Applicant about a possible first case of PML under ozanimod treatment on 24 
February 2020. This communication has been shared with the Rapporteurs as previously described. Even 
though the clinical course was stated to be unusual for PML, it could not be ruled out by cerebrospinal 
fluid testing  given  that the  patient  refused  to  undergo  under lumbar  puncture.  Follow-up  of  this  case 
evolved with significant recovery of signs and symptoms, which is very uncommon in PML, even with 
immunoreconstitution.  Notwithstanding,  to  account  for  the  slightly  altered  perception  of  the  PML  risk 
with ozanimod treatment, the Applicant proactively proposed changes in the subsection on PML, which 
was considered acceptable. In this line, ‘Serious opportunistic infections including PML’ was included as 
important potential risk in the RMP 
Considering cases of PML and cryptococcal infections occurred with other S1P receptor modulators during 
the  post-authorisation  phase,  PML  belongs  to  the  potential  risks  associated  with  S1P  receptor 
modulators. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of infections during therapy and for up 
to  3 months  after  discontinuation,  given  the  long  mean  elimination  half-life  of  the  active  ozanimod 
metabolites. Suspension of ozanimod dosing is warranted should serious infections occur. A warning in 
Section  4.4  that  immunosuppressive  effects  predisposes  patients  to  an  infection  risk,  including 
opportunistic infections was also added. Finally, the presence of severe active infections, active chronic 
infections (hepatitis and tuberculosis) and ‘Immunodeficient state’ which comprise patients with prior or 
concomitant  use  of  anti-neoplastic,  immunosuppressive  or  immune-modulating  therapies  that  were 
generally excluded from clinical studies were included as contraindication in section 4.3 of SmPC. 
Up to ~75 months of exposure as of 31 Jan 2019 generally maintained the mean reduction in ALC (of 
~55%) from baseline. While the overall incidence of infections and of serious or opportunistic infections 
was similar between the ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a treatment groups in active-controlled studies, the 
incidence  of  local  and  manageable  herpes  zoster  infections  increased  with  duration  of  exposure  but 
appeared to be roughly stable up to longest duration of exposure so far. Despite persistent lymphopenia, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 154/188 
 
 
 
there  was  no  increase  in  the  overall  incidence  of  infections,  serious  infections,  or  other  opportunistic 
infections with longer exposure. 
Malignancies were reported more frequently in the ozanimod groups as compared to IFN β-1a in Pool A1 
(0.6%  for  0.5 mg  and  1 mg  ozanimod  each  vs.  0.2%  on  IFN  β-1a)  with  an  incidence  rate  of  373.6, 
372.2, and 150.8 per 100,000 person-years. A similar number of cutaneous (3 basal cell carcinoma, one 
keratoacanthoma, one malignant melanoma in situ) and noncutaneous malignancies (3 cases of breast 
cancer, one medulloblastoma, and one testicular seminoma (pure) stage I) was reported in the ozanimod 
groups. Basal cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia occurred in the IFN β-1a group. Given 
the  imbalance  in  malignancies  observed  with  IFN  β-1a  and  ozanimod,  “malignancy”  was  included  as 
potential risk in the RMP. Review of the incidences of cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies in Pool 
A1 (the basis for inclusion of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC) revealed no specific type of cancer to be 
increased with ozanimod treatment (including data of the 4-months FDA safety update), which would 
qualify as an ADR in section 4.8. Active malignancies were added as contraindication in section 4.3 of 
SmPC.  Pharmacovigilance  activities  to  further  address  the  long-term  risk  of  malignancies  comprise 
evaluation in a real-world long-term safety study (ORION) and long-term follow-up of OLE Study RPC01-
3001.  Given  that  S1P  receptor  modulators  and  ozanimod  share  the  same  mode  of  action,  the  same 
potential  risks  with  immunosuppression  observed  in  the  postmarketing  setting  for  S1P  receptor 
modulators apply to ozanimod including the risk of skin neoplasms. Upon request, the Applicant included 
a warning on the section 4.4 of SmPC so patients treated with ozanimod should be cautioned against 
exposure to  sunlight  without  protection  and  should  not  receive  concomitant  phototherapy  with  UV-B-
radiation  or  PUVA-photochemotherapy.  Moreover,  adequate  risk  minimisation  measures  were  aligned 
with the currently approved SmPC of S1P modulators regarding skin neoplasm. 
Macular oedema is a well-known class effect and was reported in 0.3% and 0.1% of subjects on ozanimod 
0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively, upon confirmation by an expert panel on retinopathies, after at least 6 
months  of  treatment.  Most  cases  were  non-serious  and  improved  or  resolved  spontaneously  after 
stopping ozanimod. The risk of and necessary control for macular oedema in patients with risk factors 
(e.g. diabetes and uveitis) was sufficiently described in the SmPC (section 4.4) and macular oedema has 
been added as an ADRs in section 4.8 of SmPC. Discontinuation of ozanimod is recommended in patients 
developing macular oedema (section 4.4). Additional pharmacovigilance activities were proposed for this 
important potential safety concern (ORION Study and long-term follow-up of OLE Study RPC01-3001).  
PFT  revealed  mild  reductions  in  FEV1,  FVC,  FEV1/FVC  ratio,  and  DLCO,  in  subjects  on  ozanimod  1 mg 
relative  to  ozanimod  0.5 mg  and  IFN  β-1a.  Long-term  data  in  Pool  B  confirmed  these  to  occur  from 
baseline to Month 3 with only small additional reductions up to Month 24. Abnormal PFT results were the 
driver  for  an  increased  incidence  of  SDEI  in  the  ozanimod  1 mg  group  but  not  accompanied  by 
symptomatic AEs. PFT abnormalities have been summarized and reported in section 4.8 of the SmPC (as 
an ADR). Changes in FEV1 and FVC from baseline have been described in the “Description of selected 
adverse reactions” subsection. In few patients with abnormal baseline PFTs <70% (normal at screening) 
and in smokers, no deterioration of their baseline condition has been reported despite small increases in 
PFT outlier results compared to IFN β-1a. However, it still remains unknown if ozanimod worsens pre-
existing respiratory function impairment like asthma or COPD based on the limited number of patients 
treated in clinical trials with such conditions. A warning statement has thus been included in section 4.4. 
Ozanimod was not found to induce depression, suicidality or abuse potential. There was no evidence of 
rebound  or  withdrawal  in  the  active-controlled  Phase  3  RMS  studies.  Nevertheless,  phase  3  studies 
routinely observed patients for 28 days after drug discontinuation, which may not have been sufficient 
to  observe  effects  following  withdrawal  of  ozanimod  considering  the  long  half-life  of  the  active 
metabolites. Therefore, the Applicant included a warning on potential rebound upon discontinuation of 
ozanimod  in  section  4.4  in  line  with  other  S1P  receptor  modulators  and  correctly  classified  ’Effects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020

following  withdrawal  of  drug’  as  ‘missing  information’,  for  which  post-marketing  additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are planned to further evaluate this aspect.  
DDI are to be expected based on the extensive metabolism of ozanimod leading to formation of active 
metabolite  with  a  long  elimination  half-life  of  ~  11  days  each.  Wording  in  regard  to  the  uneventful 
outcome  of  these  studies  is  adequately  depicted  in  the  SmPC.  However,  since  the  two  main  active 
metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 are selective inhibitors of MAO-B, DDIs are to be expected at 
least  with  serotonergic  drugs  and  a  discretely  increased  rate  of  TEAEs  in  the  ozanimod  group  was 
reported in subjects with concomitant SSRI/SNRI administration in Pool A1, further analyses for Pool D 
were requested, which did not demonstrate difference in the incidence of serotonin syndrome extended 
broad SMQ TEAEs in patients treated with ozanimod after concomitant SSRI/SNRI administration. 
Taken  into  consideration  the  post-marketing  experience  with  a  non-selective  S1P  modulator  and 
uncertainties  about  long-term  risks  derived  from  chronic  immunosuppression  which  may  last  up  to  3 
months after discontinuation, the CHMP thoroughly discussed the safety profile of ozanimod as a key 
aspect to determine whether the benefit-risk balance should be positive for the broad indication of RRMS 
patients as requested by the Applicant or whether a restriction for highly active RRMS patients would be 
more appropriate. In order to bring crucial perspectives from physicians and patients to the discussions 
on this particular aspect, the CHMP agreed to convey a scientific advisory group for neurology (SAG-N). 
Additional expert consultations 
The Applicant of Zeposia (ozanimod) considers the benefit-risk balance of Ozanimod positive in the broad 
RRMS population, i.e., independent of disease activity (proposed indication: ‘Ozanimod is indicated for 
the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis’).  In  reply  to  the  CHMP 
questions,  the  Applicant  has  discussed  the  evidence  for  efficacy  in  patients  with  highly  active  and  in 
those with “regular” active RRMS and has compared the overall safety profile to other sphingosine 1-
phosphate modulators. 
The following questions were posed to a SAG-N Experts: 
1.  The SAG Experts are kindly asked to elaborate on the evolution of the clinical management 
of  RRMS  in  recent  years.  Are  the  experts  aware  of  highly  effective  disease  modifying 
therapies  (DMTs)  -  including  fingolimod-  being  used  in  patients  without  highly  active 
disease? If so, which criteria are used in clinical practice to make treatment decisions? 
The  SAG  experts  acknowledged  that  there  is  a  trend  towards  an  earlier  use  of  highly  effective  DMT 
including Fingolimod in the early stages of RMS to attain a more favourable outcome in patients. The 
present reimbursement rules however prevent early use of Fingolimod in several member countries. In 
this regard, the evolution of the clinical management could favour a broad indication of Ozanimod.  
According to SAG experts, there is use of highly effective DMT in patients without highly active disease 
in Europe, but this use is not homogeneous across  Europe. It was also noted that criteria of defining 
highly active MS is not standardized and some of the current definitions may be difficult to take in the 
clinical  setting.  The  fingolimod  label,  as  an  example,  allows  using  fingolimod  in  “patients  that  have  a 
“rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in 
one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 
lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.” However, with current and 2017 revised MS diagnostic 
criteria,  MS  is  mostly  diagnosed  after  the  first  relapse,  and  in  some  circumstances,  it  appears  not 
reasonable to wait for a second disabling relapse prior to using a compound with proven high efficacy as 
compared  to  e.g.  the  interferons.  New  expected  MS  criteria  for  defining  the  MS  course  (an  updated 
version of defining the clinical course of multiple sclerosis by Lublin) may help to unify this use, but so

far none is well established. In some countries, prescribers stick to the escalation algorithm. By opposite, 
interpretation of the guidelines is more flexible in other countries. Most of the SAG experts expressed 
their preference for using highly active DMT in a more liberal scenario, which is currently not feasible, 
mostly due to reimbursement restrictions. Specifically, a SAG expert commented that S1P modulators 
could be used as first-line therapy as they are highly effective and safety concerns are manageable using 
risk minimization measures as implemented in the clinical practice for Fingolimod. It was also noted that 
the risk of rebound was perceived as a potential limitation for using of Ozanimod as first line therapy 
considering the experience with Fingolimod. Albeit available data on Ozanimod do not confirm this risk, 
this may be due to the fact that only a very limited number (exact numbers could not be provided to the 
SAG by the company) of patients with “highly active MS” have stopped the treatment and have closely 
been followed since.  
The SAG experts agreed that MRI activity, particularly the number of gadolinium enhancing (GdE) lesions 
and T2 lesion burden (number of lesions) and location (spinal cord) and severity of relapses and are the 
leading factors for selecting highly efficacious DMTs as first-line therapy in the clinical practice. According 
to  SAG  experts,  other  factors  to  be  considered  include  the  presence  of  oligoclonal  bands  in  the 
cerebrospinal fluid. Several SAG experts confirmed that highly efficacious DMTs are currently off-label 
used after one disabling relapse in RRMS, and also after one not-disabling relapse in combination with 
other negative prognostic factors such high lesion burden or spinal cord lesions on MRI.  
Conclusion:  The  SAG  experts  acknowledged  that  there  is  a  trend  towards  an  earlier  use  of  highly 
effective DMT in RRMS. There is use of these drugs in patients without highly active disease in Europe, 
although  it  was  noted  that  this  use  is  not  homogeneous  across  Europe.  This  is  likely  due  to  lack  of 
standardized criteria for defining active RRMS and reimbursement restrictions due to current labelling of 
some of DMT including Fingolimod. Overall, the SAG experts expressed their preference for using highly 
active DMT, for early stages (not as second-line therapy) based on currently knowledge on effect of early 
treatment on  MS  and  experience  gathered  in  clinical  practice.  Overall,  SAG  experts  agreed  that  MRI-
derived  findings  including  the  number  of  T2  and  GdE  lesion  burden  (number  of  lesions)  and  location 
(spinal cord) together with severity of relapse are leading factors for selecting highly effective DMT as 
first-line therapy in the clinical practice while other factors (oligoclonal bands) should be also considered.  
2.  Based  on  the  known  safety  profile  of  sphingosine  1-phosphate  modulators,  the  SAG 
experts  are  kindly  asked  to  clarify  how  the  long-term  risks  (i.e.  “AIDS-like”  adverse 
events, namely infections, neoplasms and lymphopenia) are monitored in clinical practice 
and  whether  the  risks  are  considered  well  manageable.  Additionally,  the  CHMP  is 
interested in the patients’ perception and acceptance of these risks and their impact on 
quality of life.  
In the clinical practice, lymphopenia is easily and routinely monitored using blood tests. One SAG expert 
expressed  that  a  more  favourable  profile  could  be  expected  in  Ozanimod  compared  to  Fingolimod 
regarding risk of lymphopenia. 
The SAG experts agreed that main safety concerns are long-term risks, particularly malignancies with a 
specific  mention  to  skin  neoplasms.  They  considered  also  pregnancy-related  adverse  events.  For  the 
target  population  (pregnancy  and  use  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective 
contraception are contraindications), the risk of infection was not neglected but the main emphasis was 
put on the risk of malignancies particularly considering the recent findings of an epidemiological study 
based on data from a Swedish MS register that suggests that risk of malignancies is higher for Fingolimod 
than for other DMT (namely Natalizumab and Rituximab) in MS (Alping et al., Ann Neurol 2020;00:1-
12). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 157/188 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the SAG experts agreed that long-term risks are expected to be similar to the ones reported in 
other immunosuppressant therapies and particularly in Fingolimod. However, they expect that measures 
that are currently in place for other highly effective DMT such as Fingolimod could be also considered for 
Ozanimod to minimize and monitor these risks.  
Regarding these safety concerns, patients’ representatives expressed the view that, as a general position 
(not specifically linked to Ozanimod), patients will likely be willing to assume these risks provided they 
are  well-balanced  with  the  expected  efficacy.  The  uncertainty  about  long-term  safety  profile  was 
expressed by one patient representative who further expressed also a concern about an uncertain future 
therapeutic strategy if ozanimod needed to be discontinued due to efficacy failure or safety concerns. 
Potential answers received from the SAG experts were other DMT with a different mechanism of action 
or bone marrow transplantation. Another SAG expert noted that most patients will likely accept short-
term risk but caution action should be considered with regards to necessary information due to long-
term risks (mainly malignancies).  
Conclusion:  Safety  concerns  are  expected  to  be  similar  to  the  ones  reported  in  other  immune-
suppressant therapies. The SAG experts put the emphasis on uncertainties regarding the long-term risk 
of malignancy. The SAG experts agreed that risks cannot be neglected but are manageable in the clinical 
practice  using  similar  measures  to  the  ones  implemented  for  other  highly  efficacy  drugs  including 
Fingolimod. Patient’s representatives expressed the view that, as a general position, patients will likely 
be willing to assume these risks provided they are well balanced with the expected efficacy, and they 
receive a sincere information regarding long-term use risks.  
3.  Do the SAG experts consider that a restriction of the target population would be justified 
based  on  the  known  safety  profile  of  sphingosine  1-phosphate  receptor  modulators 
overall,  and  ozanimod  in  particular,  alongside  with  the  current  clinical  management  of 
these patients? 
The SAG experts agreed that a restriction of the target population for highly active RRMS is not justified 
based on safety concerns that are considered to be manageable. Nevertheless, they also reminded that 
such broad indication should also weight the real importance of therapeutic benefit against the severity 
of  risks,  even  the  rare  one.  It  was  noted  that  although  benefit  of  Ozanimod  has  been  established  on 
some outcomes (such annualized relapse rate and lesion burden), the benefit on CDP-3M and CDP-6M 
was not demonstrated. 
Based on the population included in the trial, the SAG experts agreed that Ozanimod should be indicated 
only for active RRMS to reinforce that it should not be used for stable/non-active MS patients under well-
tolerated  treatment.  Switching  from  other  drugs  to  ozanimod  should  be  allowed  despite  no  clear 
indication of active disease, for example in patients with side effects or intolerability issues.  
It was considered that the definition of an active MS could be approximated from the inclusion criteria 
of the pivotal trials. However, there was no agreement about whether these inclusion criteria should be 
directly added in the wording of the indication of Ozanimod, the judgement of clinicians for each case 
appearing more appropriate. As noted by some SAG experts, the inclusion criteria used in pivotal trials 
do not appear in the indication section of SmPC of some DMT recently approved by EMA for RRMS/RMS 
(e.g. Tecfidera and Ocrevus).  
One SAG expert even considered that ozanimod use as first treatment option in a woman childbearing 
potential could be justified if patients are willing to adhere to efficient contraception, and if they are well 
educated  about  pregnancy-related  adverse  events  such  as  the  teratogenicity  of  the  drug.  The  risk  of 
rebound  activation  after  ozanimod  cessation  could  be  managed  for  example  by  well-planned  bridging 
therapy before pregnancy initiation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 158/188 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion: The SAG experts agreed that a restriction of the target population for highly active RRMS 
based  on  safety  profile  is  not  justified.  Overall,  the  SAG  experts  expressed  the  view  that  a  broad 
indication could be considered for Ozanimod, but only for active forms of RRMS, i.e. patients who have 
experienced relapse activity during the previous year, or who have had signs of inflammatory activity in 
the MR during the previous year.  
4.  In case a broader indication is envisaged,  
a)  Are  the  SAG  experts  aware  of  possible  drug-drug  interactions  to  occur  in  the  broad 
RRMS population further affecting patients’ safety? 
If  a  broader  indication  is  granted  for  RRMS,  the  SAG  experts  did  not  consider  that  drug-drug 
interactions  could  further  impact  safety  in  this  population.  If  broad  indication  is  granted,  it  is 
expected that Ozanimod will be indicated for RRMS in an earlier phase of the MS course when the 
presence of comorbidities among RRMS patients is an unusual finding.  
b)  What kind of post-authorization data could the Applicant be requested to generate in 
order  to  support  the  clinical  safety  in  the  unrestricted  (regular  and  highly  active) 
indication? 
In addition to the described risks included in the RMP, the SAG experts did not identify any other 
risk.  As  such,  the  SAG  expert  considered  that  measures  for  gathering  post-authorization  data 
currently proposed by the Applicant to be acceptable. However, the SAG experts emphasized that 
post-authorization  data  for  informing  safety  during  pregnancy  and  risk  of  long-term  malignancy 
should be  a  priority.  Additional  post-authorization  studies  for  obtaining  safety data  for  those  with 
absolute lymphocyte count below 200 109/L and for those with low BMI/low body weight should be 
recommended. The SAG experts also considered adequate the 10-year length of duration of post-
marketing experience as provided by the Applicant. One SAG expert proposed that safety information 
could also be gathered through some European Registries.  
Conclusion:  
a)  If a broader indication is granted for RRMS, the SAG experts did not consider that drug-drug 
interactions could further impact safety in this population  
b)  Overall the SAG experts agreed with the strategies currently proposed by the Applicant to 
provide long-term safety data but emphasized the need for gathering data on safety profile 
during pregnancy and risk of long-term malignancy.   
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The main safety issues identified in the clinical program were small and transient decreases in HR, mainly 
during  titration  and  symptomatic  in  few  cases  only  (bradyarrhythmia),  macular  oedemas,  reversible 
mainly  asymptomatic  increases  in  liver  enzymes  and  reversible  (within  three  months  of  treatment 
cessation) decreases in ALC (lymphopenia), an increased risk of herpes zoster infections with long-term 
treatment and a disproportionately higher incidence in malignancies with ozanimod vs. IFN β-1a.  
The  long-term  risk  for  serious  or  opportunistic  infections  and  malignancies  could  not  sufficiently  be 
characterised within the limited period of clinical MS studies and thus prompts pharmacovigilance activity 
post-marketing.  
Despite its more targeted selectivity for S1P receptor subtypes, the overall safety profile of ozanimod, 
based  on  the  presented  clinical  data  in  RMS  patients,  appeared  qualitatively  similar  to  S1P  receptor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 159/188 
 
 
 
 
modulators except for cardiac effects during the first days of treatment for which the dose titration is 
considered to have favoured a lower effect on HR and AV conduction. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics 
of  ozanimod  need  to  be  taken  into  account  for  any  claim  on  quantitative  differences.  Despite  a 
comparatively lower mean terminal elimination half-life of ozanimod vs. other S1P receptor modulators 
(~ 22 hours vs. ~ 200 hours), two main active metabolites were reported at a rather late time point in 
the ozanimod clinical program (i.e. CC112273 and CC1084037). Both accounted for approx. 88% of the 
circulating total active drug exposure and exhibited a mean elimination half-life of approx. 11 days each. 
Thus, drug effects of ozanimod might be present for as long as 45 days after discontinuation and thus 
quantitatively comparable to other S1P receptor modulators (t1/2 200 hours; steady state after 1 to 2 
months). This should be considered regarding the risk of infections after discontinuation of treatment 
and potential drug-drug interactions. It is therefore concluded, that several risks observed with ozanimod 
were also quantitatively similar to the ones of other S1P receptor modulators. 
The Applicant’s position that tolerability and safety of ozanimod is independent of disease activity was 
acknowledged.  However, no controlled safety and pharmacokinetic data were available for RMS patients 
>55  years  of  age,  which  also  depicts  a  relevant  MS  population.  Risks  derived  from  the  long-term 
immunosuppression  due  to  maintained  reduction  in  peripheral  lymphocyte  count  were  thoroughly 
discussed during the procedure and were also discussed by the SAG-N experts.  
Available evidence including a follow-up up to 75 months did not show an increase in the incidence of 
adverse events such as increased (opportunistic) infections or malignancies. Furthermore, the Applicant 
complied with the required risk minimisation measures to cover any remaining uncertainties taking into 
consideration the broad RRMS indication applied for.  
At present, the clinical safety profile of ozanimod based on the available short- and long-term study data 
was  considered  manageable  by  applying  the  proposed  risk  minimisation  measures  in  the  product 
information together with the long-term safety data collection in post-marketing clinical trials.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the Applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The Applicant request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.12.2010. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.10.  New Active Substance 
The  Applicant  compared  the  structure  of  ozanimod  with  active  substances  contained  in  authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ozanimod hydrochloride to be a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A  request  to  omit  certain  particulars  from  the  labelling  has  been  submitted  by  the Applicant  and  has 
been  found  partially  acceptable  by  the  Quality  Review  of  Documents  (QRD)  Group  for  the  following 
reasons: 
The QRD Group requested to print at least the INN in English on the blister foil taking into account the 
pack configuration (wallet presentation) for the treatment initiation pack (4 x 0.23 mg, 3 x 0.46 mg). 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear 
in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.

2.11.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling for the purpose of accessing the most up to date version 
of the package leaflet has been submitted by the Applicant and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: approved package leaflet 
2.11.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Zeposia  (ozanimod)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication is: 
• 
Zeposia  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Relapsing-Remitting  Multiple 
Sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease as defined by clinical or imaging features.  
MS  is  a  chronic  immune-mediated  and  neurodegenerative  disease  of  the  CNS  characterized  by 
inflammation, demyelination, neuro-axonal injury leading to irreversible deficits in physical and cognitive 
functions that impair quality of life. RRMS is the most common form of MS, representing approximately 
85% of patients at diagnosis. 
There  is  no  cure  available  for  MS.  Therapies  for  MS  include  treatment  for  relapses  (e.g.  steroids), 
symptomatic treatments (e.g. drugs for stabilization of nerve conduction or dealing with pain) and those 
that alter the course of the disease (DMTs). The goal of treating RRMS with DMTs is to modify the natural 
course of disease by reducing the rate of relapses and MRI focal inflammatory activity to delay disability 
worsening. 
The aim of ozanimod is to decrease focal inflammatory activity through inhibition of lymphocyte migration 
into the CNS. In the natural history of MS there is a relation between the number / frequency of relapses 
and  focal  inflammatory  MRI  lesions,  and  accumulation  of  sustained  disability.  However,  not  all  DMT 
agents have demonstrated a concomitant reduction of disability along with a reduction in relapses in the 
phase 3 pivotal trials. This is the case for Ozanimod a demonstration of decrease in disability progression 
is lacking. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In addition to substances approved for the treatment of MS symptoms and for the treatment of relapses 
there are currently more than 10 DMTs approved for use in patients with RRMS and/or other forms of 
Assessment report

RMS in the EU. In a clinical setting, early treatment of relapsing MS usually starts with a substance from 
the IFN β class, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide, which are of rather moderate 
clinical efficacy and are therefore usually used in subjects without high disease activity. The monoclonal 
DMTs (alemtuzumab, natalizumab or ocrelizumab) and cladribine are restricted to subjects with highly 
active disease due to less favourable safety profiles.  
Fingolimod is the only S1P receptor modulator approved for RRMS. It is considered highly effective and 
has proven higher efficacy compared to the active comparator IFN β-1a with regard to annualised relapse 
rate  as  well  as  a  beneficial  effect  regarding  disability  progression  in  one  placebo-controlled  trial. 
Notwithstanding, the therapeutic indication has been restricted to highly active RRMS patients due to 
safety concerns which includes cardiac effects at initiation of treatment, infections including herpes and 
cryptococcus,  progressive  multifocal  encephalopathy,  cutaneous  malignancies,  lymphoma,  macular 
oedema, posterior reversible encephalopathy, respiratory effects, increased liver enzymes and the risk 
of rebound after stopping the treatment.  
Despite the availability of several medications for the treatment of RRMS, there remains a need for a 
highly effective oral agent with a favourable benefit, safety and tolerability profiles. Ozanimod offers an 
alternative of an effective therapy with acceptable safety and tolerability profile and a dose escalation 
regimen  that  does  not  require  first  dose  observation  in  a  majority  of  patients  apart  from  those  with 
certain pre-existing cardiac conditions. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two similarly designed pivotal Phase 3 studies of ozanimod in RMS have been submitted (Studies RPC01-
301  and  Study  RPC01-201B).  Both  studies  consisted  of  a  7-day  dose-escalation  period  followed  by  a 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group treatment period. The main 
difference between the 2 studies was the duration of the treatment period. In Study RPC01-301 (12+ 
month study), the treatment period lasted until the last enrolled subject was treated for 12 months, and 
in Study RPC01-201B (24-month study), the treatment period lasted for 2 years.  
Study  population  were  MS  diagnosed  pts  (Mc  Donald  2010  criteria),  with  RMS  and  MRI  brain  lesions 
typical of MS, between 18 and 55 years of age, with evidence of disease activity in the recent past (one 
relapse  in  the  past  year  or  one  relapse  in  the  past  2  years  and  sign  of  disease  activity  in  MRI).  The 
proposed main studies provided single and pooled data for efficacy assessment for patients with RMS 
from low to high disease activity 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both adequately designed pivotal studies, the primary objective, i.e. demonstration of superiority over 
IFN β-1a with regard to adjusted ARR was met for ozanimod HC 1mg, the recommended dose, using 
pre-specified primary analysis which resulted in a reduction in ARR of 37.7% and 48.2% compared with 
IFN  β-1a  during    the  24  and  12  months  duration  of  Study  RPC01-201B  and  Study  RPC01-301, 
respectively. Results of the PP analyses and of several pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary 
endpoint  (using  the  negative  binomial  regression  model  instead  of  the  Poisson  regression  model  and 
evaluating only confirmed relapses or confirmed and unconfirmed relapses for both models) were highly 
consistent  with  those  of  the  primary  analysis  in  the  respective  pivotal  studies.  Upon  request,  the 
Applicant provided the results of an additional analysis method using a treatment policy strategy for the 
intercurrent  event  treatment  discontinuation  based  on  the  assumption  of  the  absence  of  a  treatment 
effect after treatment discontinuation. Hence, multiple imputation analyses were provided using a J2R 
and CR approaches showing similar results.  
Assessment report

Page 167/188 
 
 
 
Results of the key secondary MRI endpoints for Ozanimod 1mg were consistent with the primary endpoint 
in both studies. A statistically significant reduction in the total adjusted mean number of new or enlarging 
hyperintense T2-weighted brain MRI lesions per scan was demonstrated with ozanimod 1 mg compared 
to IFN β-1a corresponding to a 42.35% and 48.33% reduction over 24 and 12 months in Study RPC01-
201B and Study RPC01-301, respectively. Similarly, a statistically significant reduction in the adjusted 
mean number of GdE brain MRI lesions was demonstrated with ozanimod 1 mg compared to IFN β-1a 
corresponding to 52.94% and 62.97% reduction at Month 24 and 12 in in Study RPC01-201B and Study 
RPC01-301,  respectively.  The  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  key  secondary  MRI  endpoints  resulted  in 
consistently,  nominally  significantly  greater  reductions  in  the  ozanimod  vs.  IFN  β-1a  groups  in  both 
studies. In both pivotal studies, the mean percentage change in normalised whole-brain volume change 
were lower with ozanimod 1 mg compared to IFN β-1a using pre-defined primary analyses as well as 
post hoc sensitivity analysis based on log-transformed and back transformed data.  
In both individual pivotal studies, results of the pre-specified subgroup analyses (including but not limited 
to  analyses  by  baseline  EDSS  score,  presence  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions,  prior  treatment  status  and 
number of relapses in the past 12 months) of the primary endpoint were generally consistent with the 
overall results for the 1 mg dose vs. IFN β-1a (all resulting ARR ratios favoured 1 mg ozanimod over IFN 
β-1a, and for most subgroups, the upper limit of the 95% CI was below 1). Additional sensitivity subgroup 
analyses (of the single as well as the pooled phase 3 studies) based on a negative binomial model with 
and  without  using  a  J2R  approach  for  treatment  discontinuation  produced  rather  consistent  results. 
Similarly, in the provided subgroup analyses of the pooled pivotal studies, in which additional subgroups 
e.g. based on disease activity were investigated, a consistent treatment effect was found with regard to 
1  mg  ozanimod  vs.  IFN  β-1a.  All  pooled  subgroup  analyses  were  indicative  of  nominally  statistical 
significance, except for the small number of treatment naïve subjects (i.e. subjects without any previous 
MS treatment including corticosteroids). Of particular relevance was the finding of treatment effect in 
favour of ozanimod 1mg versus INF IFN β-1a observed for patients with and without highly active RMS. 
Additionally,  requested  subgroup  analyses  also  showed  that  subjects  with  and  without  prior  IFN  β-1a 
treatment benefitted from ozanimod treatment.  
The  selection  of  the  study  centres,  favouring  Eastern  Europe  could  have  negatively  impacted 
extrapolability of benefit-risk towards an EU population. However, the Applicant further explored B/R in 
subgroups of EU and non-EU population and found that differences between EU and non-EU population 
did  not  modify  the  B/R  balance  from  the  response  as  compared  between  IFN  β-1a  and  ozanimod. 
Therefore, applicability of study results from non-EU countries to EU countries was considered sufficiently 
justified. 
While the final recommended dose is 1mg ozanimod, 0.5 mg and 1 mg ozanimod doses were evaluated 
in both pivotal studies, as well as in the supportive Study RPC01-201A (including the dose blinded Study 
RPC01-201A Extension). Compared to the 0.5 mg ozanimod dose, the 1 mg dose showed a consistently 
greater benefit with regard to relapses as well as related MRI findings in the individual studies as well as 
in the pooled data. Regarding primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, results from the pivotal 
Study  RPC01-201B  and  Study  RPC01-301  were  consistent.  As  such,  dose-response  effects  and 
consistency between pivotal studies were considered as favourable effects for this application.  
Consistency  was  also  noted  between  results  from  the  ozanimod  drug  development  program  and 
experience with other S1P receptor modulator in a relapsing population regarding treatment effects on 
measures of focal inflammatory activity.   
In the OLE Study RPC01-3001 (as of cut-off date of 30 June 2018), results regarding unadjusted as well 
as adjusted ARR in the subgroup of subjects, who were already treated with ozanimod 1 mg during the 
main study parts of the pivotal studies, appeared stable (and even tended to improve with unadjusted 
ARR of 0.164 during OLE  compared to 0.174 in parent study, and adjusted ARR of 0.133 during OLE 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 168/188 
 
 
 
compared to 0.153 during main part). Additional analyses of ARR on a yearly basis appeared to support 
these findings. The overall drop-out rate during OLE (6.9%) as well as drop-out due to a lack of efficacy 
(1.0%) were low in this study. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For blinding purposes, a dual assessor approach was used in both pivotal studies, and as per protocol, 
treatment  assignment  was  neither  to  be  disclosed  to  the  treating  nor  to  the  independent  efficacy 
evaluator. Further total WBC and all differential WBC counts were blinded information for all site staff 
including the treating investigator, subjects were instructed not to disclose symptoms related to their 
treatment regimen to the efficacy evaluator, and injection sites were to be covered. Upon request, the 
Applicant provided further clarification about measures to avoid deblinding during relapse assessment 
that  were  considered  appropriate.  While  some  degree  of  unblinding  resulting  from  different  AE-  and 
effect  profiles  of  the  investigational  products  could  be  assumed,  the  potentially  resulting  bias  was 
considered limited based on the following considerations: treating physicians were guided by a template 
questionnaire  in  determining  whether  an  unscheduled  relapse  assessment  was  to  be  scheduled  when 
they were informed by the patients of onset of a possible relapse. Confirmation of a relapse required a 
pre-specified worsening in EDSS score as evaluated by the independent (blinded) efficacy investigator. 
Further, the proportion of relapses that were confirmed by the treating investigator was consistently high 
(>90%) across all treatment groups in both phase 3 studies. In this context, subgroup analyses using 
principal strata analyses were provided for the subgroup of subjects with or without flu-like symptoms, 
since  flu-like  symptoms  were  post-baseline  measurements  influenced  by  treatment.  The  Applicant 
provided a principal strata analysis for the stratum of subjects that would obtain flu-like symptoms under 
IFN β-1a and those who would not obtain flu-like symptoms under IFN β-1a, as well as the corresponding 
analyses  regarding  the  flu-like  symptoms  obtained  under  Ozanimod.  Results  were  rather  consistent 
across  the  different  analyses  showing  different  effect  sizes  for  subjects  with  flu-like  symptoms  as 
compared to those without. Considering subjects that would obtain flu-like symptoms under IFN β-1a as 
subjects for which treatment allocation (to IFN β-1a) could have been guessed by the investigator, the 
difference in the treatment effect size between subjects that were potentially unblinded and those who 
were not was estimated by a principal stratum analysis to approximately 10 %, suggesting an increase 
from a 37% reduction to a reported 47% reduction in the effect due to potential unblinding. Although 
the influence of unblinding and that of a different population could not be disentangled, the real effect 
on the primary endpoint (ARR) might be smaller without the effect of potential unblinding. Nevertheless, 
further  reassurance  for  efficacy  was  considered  to  be  provided  by  the  results of  the  MRI-derived  key 
secondary endpoints, which were largely in line with the ARR results, as MRIs were read centrally and 
blinded,  i.e.  by  further  independent  blinded  readers  who  were  also  locally  separated  from  other 
treating/efficacy investigators. 
Regarding disability progression (CDP-3M, CDP-6M), which was pre-specified as one of the key secondary 
endpoints  based  on  the  pooled  phase  3  study  data,  no  statistically  significant  differences  between 
ozanimod  and  IFN  β-1a  were  shown.  A  low  and  similar  percentage  of  subjects  experienced  disability 
progression  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg,  ozanimod  0.5  mg,  and  IFN  β-1a  treatment  groups,  with  CDP-3M 
percentages progressed of 7.6%, 6.5%, and 7.8%, respectively, and CDP-6M percentages progressed 
of  5.8%,  4.8%,  and  4.0%,  respectively.  The  HR  (95%CI)  of  1  mg  ozanimod  vs.  IFN  β-1a  was  0.950 
(0.679, 1.330) for CDP-3M and 1.413 (0.922, 2.165) for CDP-6M. The pre-specified sensitivity analyses 
consistently favoured ozanimod over IFN β-1a regarding CDP-3M (at least numerically). Regarding CDP-
6M, some sensitivity analyses favoured ozanimod over IFN β-1a (at least numerically) some analyses 
favoured  IFN  β-1a,  however,  none  of  the  comparisons  that  numerically  favoured  IFN  β-1a  were 
(nominally)  statistically  significant.  Results  from  a  post-hoc  sensitivity  analyses  using  tentative 
progressors  with  confirmation  during  OLE  Study  RPC01-3001  as  used  in  in  the  ocrelizumab  pivotal

studies (EPAR Ocrevus MA/790835/2017) showed very similar risks for CDP-6M in the 1 mg ozanimod 
group compared to IFN β-1a (HR (95%CI): 1.040 (0.730, 1.482).  
The failed demonstration of a benefit compared to IFN β-1a with regard to disease progression could be 
explained by a couple of key aspects of the study design in the pivotal trials. First, an abbreviated too 
short study duration, particularly for Study RPC01-301 for which only patients who experienced a severe 
relapse  without  complete  recovery  (tentative  disability  progression)  within  the  first  6  months  could 
potentially show CDP-6M  by the end of the trial at 12 months. Considering the anticipated latency of 
therapeutic response and duration of studies, a very low rate of progressors was expected in the pivotal 
studies. Second, disability progression in patients with RRMS is mainly due to lack of complete recovery 
from severe relapses. In this extend, the level of baseline inflammatory activity plays a key role on the 
probability of CDP as an event. The included patient population had a rather low disease activity with 
regard to number of relapses prior to inclusion in the study (mean number of 1.3 in the past year in both 
studies, mean number of 1.7 (Study RPC01-301) and 1.8 (in Study RPC01-201B), respectively in the 
past  two  years).  It  is  however  noted  that  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  high  disease  activity  as 
measured by combined relapse and MRI criteria (as specified for subgroup analyses of the pooled phase 
3 study data) appeared not to be lower in the ozanimod trials compared to trials with other S1P receptor 
modulators  (approx.  23%  and  18%,  respectively).  This  latter  comparison  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution, as there are no uniform definitions of high disease activity, and definitions varied across trials 
of different drugs. These aspects may explain the low rate of CDP-3M and CDP-6M events in the ozanimod 
drug development program. In settings with low event rates, absolute differences between estimated 
probabilities  may  better  reflect  clinically  meaningful  differences,  while  estimated  HR  may  numerically 
distort the magnitude of differences. The additional analyses of the absolute difference between the KM 
estimates for CDP-6M for ozanimod 1mg compared to IFN β-1a using the pre-specified primary analysis 
provided  by  the  Applicant  are  therefore  considered  to  allow  for  a  reasonable  evaluation  of  CDP-6M. 
According  to  these  analyses,  no  statistically  significant  difference  for  CDP-6M  outcomes  was  found 
between  both  treatment  groups,  while  an  approx.  4%  higher  CDP-6M  rate  after  2  years  of  ozanimod 
treatment could not be excluded. However, the Applicant additionally provided a Bayesian analysis which 
estimated the probability of a 4% (or greater) difference in CDP-6M to be low (5.4%), further formal 
testing to evaluate a true difference of at least 4% yielded a p-value of 0.948.  
In  regards  of  an  effect  on  other  disability  outcomes,  results  of  the  MSFC  (with  or  without  LCLA)  and 
physical QOL-54 and (at least) numerically favoured the ozanimod groups over IFN β-1a. With regard to 
SDMT, used as cognitive MSFC component in Study RPC01-301, there was indication of a beneficial effect 
of ozanimod on processing speed, as nominally significant differences in means (95%CI) vs. IFN β-1a 
were found for ozanimod 1 mg group (0.111 [0.039, 0.182]; p=0.0024). However, in contrast, in Study 
RPC01-201B,  PASAT  was  used  as  cognitive  component,  which  measures  other  aspects  of  cognition 
beyond processing speed, and the resulting difference from baseline was not numerically better in the 1 
mg ozanimod group compared to IFN β-1a. As SDMT was not used in Study RPC01-201B, the positive 
effect on processing speed found in Study RPC01-301 could not be replicated, further it is still unclear 
whether  processing  speed  sufficiently  covers  overall  cognitive  function  in  MS  as  discussed  during

(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/336445/2019). 
Whereas 760 subjects were constantly treated with 1 mg ozanimod throughout parent studies and OLE 
Study RPC01-3001, of which 398 were at least treated for 3 years, the number of subjects treated for 
at least 4 years was low as of data cut-off for MAA (30 Jun 2018) (n=44). During OLE Study RPC01-
3001, the overall proportion of subjects with CDP in the OLE mITT population continued to be low and 
was 7.0% (CDP-3M), and 5.1% (CDP-6M). Neither the median time to CDP-3M or CDP-6M, nor the time 
to the 25% percentile could be estimated due to the low event rate. However, as mentioned in the MS 
Guideline, the course of multiple sclerosis with respect to disability is slow and therefore even longer

follow-up might be needed. As of data cut-off for MAA (30 Jun 2018) the retention rate in OLE Study 
RPC01-3001 was > 90% with a high number of subjects still participating in the study (N=2,323). The 
final study results after all subjects will have been exposed to 1 mg ozanimod for a minimum of 5 years 
are scheduled to be available in 2022. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  ozanimod  has  been  examined  in  a  comprehensive  clinical  development  program 
with more than 3,400 having been exposed to ozanimod and over 8,000 person-years of follow-up in 
RMS and IBD. Ozanimod was well tolerated, with a low rate of discontinuation and a lower incidence of 
SAEs.  
Initiation  of  ozanimod  treatment  using  dose  titration  over  7  days  is  mechanistically  based  on  the 
successive  desensitization  of  G-protein-coupled  inwardly  rectifying  potassium  channels  via  down-
modulation of S1P1 receptors and was associated with a transient reduction in HR in most patients (mean 
decline of 1.2 bpm in mean sitting/ supine pulse on Day 1 with a 0.25 mg dose of ozanimod), which was 
not associated with clinically significant bradycardia or conduction abnormalities (i.e. second- or third-
degree  AV  block).  Bradycardia  (incl.  sinus  bradycardia)  was  reported  in  1.2%  of  patients  on  total 
ozanimod in Pool A1 and 2 subjects reported symptomatic bradycardia in the ozanimod 0.5 mg group in 
Pool A1. No HR <40 bpm was observed. Symptomatic bradycardia was included as important potential 
risk  in  the  RMP.  First-degree  AV  block  was  reported  as  TEAE  in  0.2%  of  subjects  on IFN  β-1a  and  in 
0.6% of subjects on ozanimod 1 mg. Any other conduction abnormalities were similarly observed in all 
treatment groups.  
Treatment with ozanimod resulted in an average increase of 1-2 mmHg in SBP and a smaller average 
increase  of  1  mmHg  in  DBP  over  IFN  β-1a  corresponding  to  approx.  4.1  mmHg  and  1.8  mmHg  from 
baseline, approx. 3 months after treatment initiation with only small increases thereafter up to Month 
24.  Hypertension-related  events  (combined  terms)  were  reported  as  ADRs  in  4.5%  of  patients  on 
ozanimod 1 mg and in 2.4% of patients on IFN β-1a in Pool A1, while the incidence did not substantially 
increase with long-term exposure. Hypertension was included as ADR in the section 4.8 of SmPC. 
Ozanimod causes elevations of liver enzymes, especially ALT and GGT increases, but also small increases 
in  bilirubin,  which  were  mainly  related  to indirect  bilirubin.  Mean  values  were found elevated  starting 
from Week 4 (in the phase 2 study) and mainly increased between Month 3 and Month in the Pool A1. 
Abnormalities in liver enzymes, typically ALT ≥3x ULN and GGT>2.5x ULN, were reported in 5.5% and 
12.3% of patients treated with ozanimod 1 mg and in ~3% each for IFN β-1a, with a median time to 
onset  of  approx.  6  months  after  treatment  initiation.  Following  study  drug  discontinuation,  ALT 
abnormalities  ≥3x  ULN  returned  to  <3x  ULN  within  one  month  and  to  near  baseline  values  within  4 
months. Liver enzyme increases were generally not associated with hepatic TEAEs; however, “hepatitis 
toxic” was reported in 4 subjects on ozanimod. Up to ~1% of subjects discontinued due to hepatic TEAEs. 
None of the patients treated with ozanimod met the criteria for Hy’s law. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) were not studied and treatment with ozanimod is thus contraindicated. 
Severe liver injury is a potential risk in the RMP. 
Reductions  in  lymphocyte  counts  have  expectedly  been  reported,  based  on  the  mode  of  action  of 
ozanimod,  in  nearly  all  patients  in  the  ozanimod  1  mg  group  (shift  from  baseline  to  low  in  94%  of 
patients) compared to the IFN β-1a group (shift from baseline to low in 24.4% of patients). There was 
a dose-dependent reduction of peripheral lymphocyte count to approximately 45% of baseline at Month 
3,  corresponding  to  a  mean  blood  lymphocyte  count  of  0.8  x  109/L  and  this  reduction  was  sustained 
throughout the treatment period. Grade 4 lymphocyte count reductions (<0.2 x 109/L) were observed in 
3.3% and 0.4% of patients in the ozanimod 1 mg and 0.5 mg group and in no patient on IFN β-1a in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 171/188 
 
 
 
Pool A1 and in 5.5% of subjects on ozanimod 1 mg in Pool B. Time to recovery of lymphocyte counts 
less than 1 x 109/L to within normal range took up to 3 months in 90% of patients. Lymphopenia was 
included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The  decrease  in  ALC  due  to  ozanimod  may  increase  susceptibility  to  infections.  The  overall  rate  of 
infections in controlled studies was comparable for the ozanimod 1 mg and IFN β-1a group (35.1% and 
34.5%).  No  disseminated  or  serious  opportunistic  infections,  including  PML,  were  reported  up  to 
75 months of treatment with ozanimod. 
On 24 February 2020, EMA became aware of a possible first case of PML under ozanimod treatment in 
the ongoing OLE Study RPC01-3001. Even though the clinical course was stated to be unusual for PML, 
it could not be ruled out given that no cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal was performed, PML could neither 
be  ruled  out  nor  confirmed.  Follow-up  of  this  case  evolved  with  significant  recovery  of  signs  and 
symptoms,  which  is  very  uncommon  in  PML,  even  with  immunoreconstitution.  Notwithstanding,  to 
account  for  the  slightly  altered  perception  of  the  PML  risk  with  ozanimod  treatment,  the  Applicant 
proactively  proposed  changes  in  the  subsection  on  PML,  which  was  considered  acceptable.  Serious 
opportunistic  infections  including  PML  was  already  included  as  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP 
considering  experience  with  other  DMT.  Serious  infections  including  opportunistic  infections  were  not 
associated with an ALC value of <0.2x 109/L in Pool A1. Non-serious Herpes Zoster infections (including 
VZV  infection)  occurred  in  0.2%,  0.3%,  and  0.6%  of  subjects  on  IFN  β-1a,  ozanimod  0.5  mg,  and 
Ozanimod 1 mg in Pool A1, and the incidence increased with long-term treatment (Pool B: ozanimod 1 
mg 1.1%, Pool B; 30 Jun 2018), but the incidence rate remained stable thereafter (using the Pool B data 
cut-off 31 Jan 2019). None of the Herpes Zoster infections was serious or led to discontinuation of study 
drug.  Overall,  persistent  lymphopenia  with  longer  exposure  did  not  increase  the  overall  incidence  of 
infections, serious infections, or other opportunistic infections. These data should be interpreted in the 
light of the knowledge of the known safety profile of S1P modulators 
Malignancies occurred in 0.6% of subjects on ozanimod (both doses) compared to 0.2% of subjects on 
IFN  β-1a  in  Pool  A1.  The  incidence  of  noncutaneous  (predominantly  breast  cancer)  and  cutaneous 
malignancies (predominantly basal cell carcinoma) was balanced with ozanimod. The incidence rates and 
types  of  malignancies  (i.e.  nonmelanoma  skin  cancers  and  noncutaneous  malignancies  like  breast 
cancer)  remained  stable  with  up  to  75  months’  exposure  to  ozanimod  1 mg.  Malignancies  typically 
observed  with  broader  immunosuppressive  therapies,  such  as  lymphomas,  have  not  been  reported. 
Given the imbalance in malignancies observed with IFN β-1a and ozanimod, “malignancy” was included 
as potential risk in the RMP. Active malignancies were added as contraindication in section 4.3 of SmPC. 
An  increased  risk  of  skin  malignancies  is  labelled  for  S1P  receptor  modulators.  As  such,  a  dedicated 
section for Cutaneous neoplasms was included in section 4.4 of SmPC. 
Macular oedema, a well-known class effect, was confirmed for 4 patients (0.2%) on ozanimod versus no 
patient  on  IFN  β-1a  in  Pool  A1  and  in  an  additional  5  patients  in  uncontrolled  studies  (including  IBD 
studies).  All  cases  happened  in  the  context  of  other  risk  factors  or  confounding  conditions  and  most 
cases  were  non-serious  and  improved  or  resolved  spontaneously  after  stopping  ozanimod.  Cases  of 
macular oedema in the controlled studies did not occur before 6 months of treatment with variable time 
to  onset  from  baseline,  while  two  subjects  had  an earlier onset of  macular oedema (within  2  months 
after treatment initiation with ozanimod in open-label studies). As stated in section 4.4, patients with a 
history of uveitis and diabetes mellitus type I or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II have an increased 
risk for macular oedema, and thus require ophthalmologic assessment before and during therapy with 
ozanimod. Continuation of ozanimod in patients with macular oedema has not been evaluated. Macular 
oedema is stated as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Small reductions in PFT (mainly FEV1, FVC, and DLCO) were noted from Month 3 on in all treatment groups 
but higher with ozanimod as compared to IFN β-1a. The median change from baseline for FEV1 and FVC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 172/188 
 
 
 
at Month 12 and Month 24 with ozanimod 1 mg was approx. 100 ml. These changes were not associated 
with related adverse events. Although no deterioration in PTF was observed in few patients with abnormal 
baseline PFTs <70% (normal at screening) and in smokers, ozanimod should be used with caution in 
patients with severe respiratory disease, pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) as stated in section 4.4 of SmPC. Pulmonary function test abnormal is stated as an ADR in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
One case of PRES was reported in a patient in the context of Guillain-Barré syndrome and autonomic 
instability.  PRES  was  also  found  related  with  S1P  receptor  modulators  treatment.  As  such,  PRES  was 
included as a potential risk for ozanimod. This subject had a fatal event of chronic kidney disease. None 
of the 7 deaths that occurred during the clinical program was considered related to the study drug by 
the Sponsor, although two deaths in the IBD program were considered to be related to study drug by 
the investigator and unrelated to study drug by the Sponsor.  
Animal studies showed embryo-lethality and teratogenicity in two animal species. 21 live births in the 
RMS program (a total of 23 live births including IBD studies) resulted in healthy infants upon delivery. 
Considering  the  lack  of  any  safety  margins,  the  established  role  of  the  S1P1  receptor  in  vascular 
development and the experience gained with S1P receptor modulators, the administration of ozanimod 
during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential not using effective contraception was included 
as contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In contrast to the predominance and persistence of the major active human metabolites CC112273 and 
CC1084037, which represent the main pharmacological activity in humans (73% and 15% of the total 
active drug exposure in humans, respectively), their clearance was enhanced in animals leading to clearly 
lower  and  insufficient  exposure  levels  compared  to  humans  receiving  the  proposed  clinical  ozanimod 
therapy.  Consequently,  no  relevant  safety  margins  of  CC112273  and  CC1084037  were  obtained  in 
animals. Attempts to increase the exposure by direct oral administration of CC112273 failed, because of 
the  extensive  bacterial  degradation  by  the  gut  microflora.  In  addition,  the  poor  aqueous  solubility  of 
CC112273  and  CC1084037  prevented  the  maximization  of  systemic  exposure  by  intravenous 
administration. For this reason, the whole toxicology program of ozanimod is inconclusive and cannot 
reliably  support  the  safety  of  ozanimod  in  humans,  which  should  be  considered  for  the  clinical  risk 
assessment. 
Uncertainty  was  raised  on  whether  the  totality  of  patients  with  pre-existing  cardiac  conditions  or 
concomitant CV medication that were excluded from participation in the clinical RMS trials can safely be 
treated with ozanimod. Although, a vast majority of these conditions was included as contraindication in 
the SmPC, some were not, for example patients with a resting HR<55 bpm, those with prolonged QTcF 
interval or additional risks for QT prolongation as well as those with concomitant medication known to 
impact  cardiac  conduction.  A  post-hoc  analysis  of  cardiovascular  TEAE  evaluation  stratified  by 
cardiovascular  medical  history  and  cardiovascular  concomitant  medication  showed  an  increase  in  the 
incidence  of  events  (such  as  bradycardia,  first-degree  AV  block,  hypertension  and  orthostatic 
hypotension) in subjects treated with ozanimod compared to those with IFN β-1a treatment. Upon further 
clarification, it was found that the numerical imbalance could be attributed to TEAEs related to treatment 
initiation with ozanimod (e.g., asymptomatic bradycardia and sinus bradycardia on dosing Day 1) and 
to its vascular safety (e.g., hypertension and orthostatic hypotension). Concomitant administration of 
class Ia or class III antiarrhythmic drugs were not investigated and might worsen the cardiac safety of 
ozanimod.  Appropriate  wording  was  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  recommend  observed 
treatment  initiation  and  further  monitoring  on  patients  as  well  as  cardiologist  advice  on  treatment 
initiation/monitoring  in  patients  with  certain  pre-existing  conditions  and  those  treated  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 173/188 
 
 
 
antiarrhythmics. Nevertheless, it remained unclear whether cardiac safety during maintenance treatment 
in these patients was impacted. Consequently, the RMP adequately reflects “long-term cardiovascular 
effects”  as  missing  information  to  address  the  need  for  data  with  ozanimod  treatment  in  patients 
suffering from cardiovascular comorbidities. Small increases in SBP and DBP were reported in patients 
treated with ozanimod along with a difference in hypertension-related TEAEs between ozanimod and IFN 
β-1a. Although the Applicant clarified that a worsening of pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension (defined 
post-hoc) was not observed, a specific warning to obtain cardiologist advice before initiation of ozanimod 
in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension was included in section 4.4 of SmPC. 
At present, no increased risk for drug-induced liver injury with ozanimod could be deduced from clinical 
trial  data.  However,  ozanimod  unequivocally  dose-related  increased  hepatic  enzymes  including  slight 
increases in bilirubin over time, which justified the inclusion of routine liver monitoring and adequate 
warnings in section 4.4 of SmPC. Given that subjects with a number of pre-existing hepatic conditions, 
including chronic hepatic impairment or liver enzymes/ bilirubin ≥ 1.5x ULN were excluded from clinical 
studies,  the  effect  of  ozanimod  in  these  subjects  remains  unknown.  In  this  line,  a  majority  of  the  8 
subjects  (10  subjects)  suspect  of  drug-induced  liver  injury  in  the  clinical  phase  3  RMS  (RMS  +  IBD) 
studies  had  pre-existing  conditions  that  made  them  more  susceptible  for  the  observed  liver  enzyme 
changes. As such, severe liver injury as potential important risk was included in the RMP. No clinically 
relevant effects were deduced from a phase 1 study in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
and extrapolation of a single 0.25 mg dose used in this study to a maintenance dose of 1 mg in subjects 
with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment  was  considered  acceptable.  Patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment were neither included in phase 1 or phase 3 pivotal studies of ozanimod. Thus, severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C)’ was added as a contraindication in section 4.3 of SmPC. 
The  key  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  ozanimod  is  a  rapid  decline  in  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  on 
treatment  initiation.  The  dose-dependently  impaired  trafficking  of  B  and  T  cells  reduced  the  immune 
response against foreign antigens in animals and has been similarly reported for S1P receptor modulators 
(Mehling  et  al.,  2008).  Bacterial  and  viral  infections  including  PML  were  commonly  observed  during 
clinical  S1P  receptor  modulators  therapy  necessitating  specific  risk  minimisation  measures 
(EMA/688187/2015).  In  particular,  an  increased  risk  for  infections  is  to  be  expected  within  3  months 
after discontinuation of ozanimod based on the long mean elimination half-life of ozanimod metabolites 
(CC112273 and CC1084037) requiring increased surveillance during this time, which was also described 
in  the  SmPC.  Although,  a  clear  relationship  between  peripheral  blood  lymphocyte  count  and  the 
occurrence of (non) serious infections was not detected, even in long-term ozanimod treatment, serious 
and/or opportunistic infections are an expected risk for the class of S1P receptor modulators. Therefore, 
‘Serious opportunistic infections including PML’ was  included as important potential risk in the RMP in 
line  with  the  experience  with  S1P  receptor  modulators.  Furthermore,  the  risk  for  acquiring  serious  or 
opportunistic infections in subjects with severe active infections, systemic opportunistic infections (such 
as PML and cryptococcal meningitis), and active chronic infections (e.g. viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), as 
well  as  those  with  prior  or  concomitant  antineoplastic,  immunosuppressive,  or  immune-modulating 
therapies, is undetermined as these patients were generally excluded from clinical studies. A post hoc 
analysis  found  that  subjects  with  prior  DMT  treatments  had  increased  incidences  of  AEs  from  the 
infections and infestations SOC as compared to those not previously treated with such drugs. Therefore, 
immunodeficient state (e.g. due to intercurrent illness or as the result of immunosuppressive therapy), 
severe  active  infections  and  active  chronic  infections  (hepatitis,  tuberculosis)  were  included  as 
contraindications in section 4.3 of SmPC and a warning in regard to patients with prior and concomitant 
treatment  with  antineoplastic,  immunosuppressive, or  immune-modulating  therapies  added in  section 
4.4 of SmPC. 
In the controlled studies, there was a higher incidence of malignancies with ozanimod as compared to 
IFN β-1a. Half of the reported malignancies were cutaneous malignancies, mainly basal cell carcinoma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 174/188 
 
 
 
The incidence and types of malignancies (i.e. nonmelanoma skin cancers and noncutaneous malignancies 
like  breast  cancer)  remained  stable  from  the  original  marketing  authorization  application  submission 
(data cut of 30 Jun 2018; up to 68 months’ exposure to ozanimod 1 mg) through the US FDA 4MSU 
(data cut of 31 Jan 2019; up to 75 months’ exposure to ozanimod 1 mg),  and remain within expectations 
for the general population and the age-matched MS population in the SEER cancer registry. Although, 
cutaneous neoplasms were not found in long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with ozanimod or 
S1P receptor modulators in animals, ozanimod widely distributes into ocular and cutaneous structures 
and  shows  melanin-binding.  An  increased  risk  for  skin  tumours  was  apparent  after  marketing 
authorisation  of  S1P  receptor  modulators  and  resulted  in  recent  mitigation  measures  to  minimise  the 
human risk (see EMA/688187/2015 and EMA/82227145/2017). The overall available data for ozanimod 
to date did not suggest that the risk for cutaneous and non-cutaneous malignancies may be different 
from  that  of  other  S1P  receptor  modulators  and  as  such,  the  same  warnings  and  measures  apply 
including a warning of cutaneous neoplasms in the SmPC. Given the insufficient exposure of animals in 
carcinogenicity studies and the well-known limitations of clinical studies required for approval, i.e. the 
restricted number of treated subjects and the duration of follow-up, a firm conclusion on the potential 
(long-term) risk for malignancies associated with ozanimod treatment could not be made. However, this 
risk is expected given that immunosurveillance might be compromised with ozanimod and malignancy 
as an important potential risk in RMP was proposed to be addressed by the long-term studies ORION 
and the follow-up of OLE Study RPC01-3001.  
All cases of macular oedema, a well-known class effect, happened in the context of other risk factors or 
confounding conditions and were overall non-serious and improved/resolved after stopping ozanimod. 
Macular oedema was added as an ADR in section 4.8 and a warning was added in section 4.4 of SmPC. 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities were proposed for this important potential risk in the RMP. 
The  predominant  toxicity  across  in  all  animal  species  was  pronounced  lung  oedema  and  histiocytosis 
which  was  also  observed  with  another  S1P  receptor  modulator  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  and  is 
mechanistically  related  to  the  breakdown  of  the  endothelial  barrier  in  the  lungs  by  S1P1  receptor 
modulation  (Shea  et al.,  2010;  Oo  et al.,  2011).  There  is  no  evidence  for  an  increased  incidence  of 
respiratory events with continuous ozanimod treatment in the long-term Pool B following the discrete 
decline  in  PFT.  This  risk  was  described  in  the  SmPC  and  decreases  in  PFTs  (pertaining  to  the  sum  of 
several preferred terms in line with decreases in PFT) were included as an ADR for ozanimod. Moreover, 
uncertainty was raised to which extent patients with risk factors like smoking, asthma or COPD, which 
themselves cause abnormal PFTs, can safely be treated with ozanimod over time. While current smokers 
on ozanimod were not found to have been differentially impaired in their respiratory function compared 
to those being treated with IFN β-1a, only limited data are available to substantiate a risk in those being 
affected  by  asthma  or  COPD.  Therefore,  a  warning  statement  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  has  been 
implemented to account for a cautious use of S1P receptor modulators in patients with severe respiratory 
disease, pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
DDI  were  reported  in  line  with  the  extensive  metabolism  of  ozanimod.  After  initiation  of  concomitant 
SSRI/ SNRI medication, an increased incidence of TEAEs (driven by hypertension) was noted in subjects 
on ozanimod compared to IFN β-1a in Pool A1, which was not observed in Pool D.  
The safety profile of ozanimod in the treatment of subjects with RMS has been sufficiently evaluated up 
to an age cut-off of 55 years. No (controlled) safety data are available for paediatric subjects (<18 years 
of age) and elderly subjects (> 55 years of age). Limited data for those with a screening age of 55 in 
the phase 3 trials and subsequently treated in extension studies (n=161 patients in Pool B including the 
US FDA 4MSU) did not indicate a worse safety profile of ozanimod. However, no firm conclusion could 
be made with regard to long-term safety in the elderly based on the available data. The posology section 
has been amended, accordingly. Safety data for pregnant and lactating women is limited.

As  indicated  above,  ozanimod  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  child-bearing 
potential not using effective contraception. However, some off-label use can be expected and as such, 
embryofoetal toxicity in exposed pregnant females was included as a potential important risk for which 
additional pharmacovigilance activities were proposed.  
Information on the effects following withdrawal of ozanimod is lacking, which is caused by the insufficient 
follow-up time due to the prolonged half-life of ozanimod active metabolites. This was included as missing 
information  and  considered  to  be  addressed  in  a  post-marketing  setting  using  long-term  studies/ 
extension study data from ORION and OLE Study RPC01-3001.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ozanimod 1 mg has shown a consistent, statistically significant and clinically relevant effect with regard 
to reducing the number of relapses (by 48.2% after 1 year of treatment in Study RPC01-301 and 36.7% 
after 2 years of treatment in Study RPC01-201B) compared to the established active comparator IFN 
β1-a in a study population with active RRMS. Effects of the pre-specified primary analysis for the 1 mg 
ozanimod dose were corroborated by sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint as well as secondary 
endpoints  evaluating  focal  inflammatory  MRI  activity.  It  was  of  particular  interest,  that  from  the 
presented  subgroup  analyses  a  consistent  treatment  effect  of  ozanimod  on  relapses  was  shown, 
regardless  of  absence/presence  of high  disease  activity,  number of  relapses  in  the  prior  one  and  two 
years, respectively, absent/present GdE lesions, number of T2 lesions, EDSS score at baseline, or prior 
DMT  use  status  at  baseline.  Therefore,  there  was  no  need  to  restrict  the  indication  to  a  certain  sub-
population of active RRMS from an efficacy point of view.  
Compared  to  IFN  β1-a,  ozanimod  failed to  demonstrate  that  its  superior  effects  on  inflammation  was 
accompanied by slowing of disability progression. As derived from the pre-specified analysis, the HR of 
0.950 correspond to a numerical 5% relative risk reduction in CDP-3M for ozanimod compared to IFN β-

1a.  Regarding  CDP-6M  the  HRs  of  1.413  for  1  mg  ozanimod  correspond  to  a  numerical  relative  risk 
increase  for  CDP-6M  of  41.3%.  These  HRs  are  within  sampling  variability  based  on  their  95%  CIs  of 
having no treatment effect. Additionally, provided sensitivity analyses showed no statistically significant 
difference in favour of IFN β1-a, while an unlikely scenario of approx. 4% higher CDP-6M rate after 2 
years  of  ozanimod  treatment  compared  to  the  active  comparator  IFN  β1-a  could  formally  not  be 
excluded.  The  failure  to  show  a  beneficial  effect  on  CDP-3M/6M  rates  compared  to  IFN  β1-a  may  be 
attributed to the low CDP event rate in a population, mainly treatment naïve with low pre-existing disease 
activity,  in  combination  with  a  too  short  study  duration.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  included  patient 
population had a rather low disease activity with regard to number of relapses prior to inclusion in the 
study (mean number of 1.3 in the past year in both studies, mean number of 1.7 (Study RPC01-301) 
and  1.8  (in  Study  RPC01-201B),  respectively  in  the  past  two  years).  While  relapses  are  not  the  only 
factor implicated in future disability progression, relapses have been discussed in literature to indicate 
disease activity and to predict disability progression (Giovannoni et al. 2016). Based on experience with 
other SP1 receptor agonists, a lack or even detrimental effect on disability progression in the presence 
of a clear anti-inflammatory effects appears highly unlikely. 
Long-term  follow-up  data  will  be  provided  by  the  Applicant,  when  all  subjects  included  in  OLE  Study 
RPC01-3001 will have been exposed for a minimum of 5 years. 
The safety database for ozanimod is considered comprehensive with more than 3,400 patients with either 
RRMS or IBD having been treated so far, including 2,765 subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg for more 
than 1 years, 1,226 treated for more than 2 years, and 613 treated for more than 3 years. Patients have 
been followed for up to 75 months. 
The currently available safety profile is qualitatively in line with that of other S1P receptor modulators. 
No unexpected safety issues were identified for ozanimod. Moreover, the most relevant safety findings 
with ozanimod in the MS clinical program occurred with a similar frequency as with other S1P receptor 
modulators, i.e. blood pressure changes, liver enzyme increases, macular oedema, decreases in PFTs, 
infections due to a dose-dependent reduction in ALC, and malignancies. 
As  opposed  to  non-selective  S1P  receptor  modulators,  ozanimod  does  not  modulate  S1P2  and  S1P3 
receptors.  While  it  was  agreed  that  the  clinical  effects  of  S1P2  and  S1P3  chronic  modulation  on 
cardiovascular  system  deserved  further  investigation,  preclinical  studies  suggest  that  modulation  is 
associated  with  pro-inflammatory  and  pro-fibrotic  responses.  Nevertheless,  cardiac  effects  in  humans 
(Gergely et al., 2012) and reproduction toxicities observed with another selective S1P receptor modulator 
in animals underlined the predominant role of S1P1 receptor modulation. 
In view of the pharmacokinetic profile of ozanimod, the impact of S1P1 receptor modulation on cardiac 
atrioventricular conduction therefore necessitated the development of an initial titration regimen. The 
applied dose escalation over 7 days led to mitigation of cardiac events caused by HR decreases. Titrated 
ozanimod compared favourably to non-titrated S1P receptor modulators in almost all first-dose cardiac 
monitoring  outcomes  evaluated  by  Matching  Adjusted  Indirect  Comparison  (MAIC).  However,  a  more 
cautious approach was considered necessary in patients with underlying cardiac disease and in patients 
on  concomitant  medication  affecting  heart  rhythm  and/  or  conduction,  especially  during  treatment 
initiation. Based on a post-hoc analysis, both subsets of patients were reported to have had a higher 
incidence of cardiac and vascular adverse events in line with the cardiac safety profile of ozanimod (first-
dose bradycardias and hypertension/ orthostatic hypotension during treatment). Therefore, appropriate 
risk  mitigation  measures  proposed  were  an  additional  6 hours  post-dose  observation  on  Day 1  of 
treatment in patients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions and cardiologist advice for patients with 
relevant  conditions/  medications  (including  antiarrhythmic  drugs).  Patients  presenting  with  severe 
cardiac  conditions  (i.e.  MI,  unstable  angina,  stroke,  TIA,  decompensated  heart  failure  requiring 
hospitalisation or NYHA Class III/IV heart failure in the 6 months prior to treatment initiation; patients

with  history  or  presence  of  second-degree  AV  block  Type  II  or  third-degree  AV  block  or  sick  sinus 
syndrome  unless  the  patient  has  a  functioning  pacemaker)  are  not  to  be  treated  with  ozanimod 
(contraindication). 
For  comparisons  presented  in  the  MAIC  report  based  on  the  1-year  and  2-years  follow-up  data,  the 
overall  safety  profile  of  ozanimod  was  not  suggested  to  be  quantitatively  different  to  S1P  receptor 
modulators. The seemingly favourable outcome of some selected parameters (e.g. ALT values ≥ 3x ULN 
and ALC <0.2x 109/L) needs to be interpreted with caution considering several methodological limitations 
of such cross-study comparisons.  
The frequency of malignancies was slightly higher for ozanimod compared to IFN β-1a in the controlled 
clinical  trials,  but  no  cluster  of  malignancies  was  observed  as  would  be  typically  seen  with 
immunosuppressants. Basal cell carcinoma and breast cancer dominated in the group of cutaneous and 
noncutaneous neoplasms (three events each). Of note, the overall incidence of malignancies was low 
and did not increase with long-term treatment. It was in the range of epidemiological (MS) data and in 
line with other S1P receptor modulators. Nevertheless, a causal relationship can neither be established 
nor ruled out based on available clinical data. Therefore, the proposed long-term studies are deemed 
essential to address the potential risk of malignancies. 
Although, the risk for serious and opportunistic infections was not increased based on pooled incidences 
of  events  from  controlled  studies  in  Pool  A1,  the  two  controlled  studies  RPC01-301  and  RPC01-201B 
differed  in  duration  (12  and  24  months,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  Herpes  Zoster  infections  was 
reported at similar rates in all treatment groups of Study RPC01-301, but at a higher incidence in the 
ozanimod  treatment  groups  as  compared  to  IFN  β-1a  in  Study  RPC01-201B.  The  event  rate  further 
increased with considerably longer exposure in the OLE Study RPC01-3001. Longer treatment duration 
increased the risk for (serious) opportunistic infections, and this risk was retained for up to 3 months 
after  treatment  discontinuation,  which  can  be  explained  by  the  long  elimination  half-life  of  the  active 
metabolites. Therefore, monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection is recommended for this period. 
It  remains  uncertain  if  serious  and  opportunistic  infections  are  more  likely  to  occur  if  patients  have 
previously been treated with immunosuppressants or are in need for concomitant immunosuppressant 
treatment  due  to  other  immune-mediated  condition.  A  respective  warning  has  been  included  in  the 
SmPC, section 4.4. Similarly, it cannot not be ruled out that rare opportunistic infections like PML might 
occur.  In  this  context,  the  case  of  a  subject  with  unusual  (partially  recovered)  worsening  of  the 
neurological status in the OLE Study RPC01-3001 was reported to EMA, for whom PML could formally 
not be excluded. Notwithstanding, there was a sustained improvement in the patient condition, which 
decreases the possibility of PML. 
As a result of the safety review, the following patients have been excluded from treatment in the SmPC 
(section 4.3) or a precautionary warning was added in section 4.2 or 4.4 of the SmPC:  
•  with a cardiac history or cardiac comorbidities or concomitant cardiac medication,  
•  with a hepatic medical history or severe hepatic impairment,  
•  with severe active infections, systemic opportunistic infections, and active chronic infections or 
those  with  prior  or  concomitant  use  of  anti-neoplastic,  immunosuppressive  or  immune-
modulating therapies, 
•  with risk factors for Macular oedema, such as uveitis and diabetes, 
•  with known active malignancies, 
•  with a risk for severe pulmonary function impairment, such as COPD, 
•  who are elderly, 
•  who are pregnant.

Reported adverse events of special interest were translated into appropriate risk mitigation measures in 
the product information as well as in the RMP in line with other S1P receptor modulators.  
Long-term  safety  of  ozanimod  will  be  further  investigated  in  the  ongoing  OLE  Study  RPC01-3001. 
Additional  data  will  be  generated  in  the  ORION  study,  a  real-world  safety  –  post  authorisation, 
multinational, long-term non-interventional study, that is proposed to focus on the potential risks and 
missing information associated with ozanimod.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ozanimod has been shown to be more efficacious than IFN β1-a with regard to preventing relapses and 
inflammatory  lesions  in  patients  with  active  RRMS  regardless  of  the  level  of  inflammatory  activity.  
Although a stronger anti-inflammatory effect could be expected to result in more pronounced slowing of 
disability  progression  and  other  S1P  agonists  have  shown  such  effects  (although  partly  in  different 
settings),  ozanimod  failed  to  demonstrate  superior  efficacy  vs.  IFN  β1-a  regarding  progression  of 
disability as assessed through persistent worsening both at 3 and 6 months. This failure may be explained 
by a too short comparative observation period of 12 months in a study population with low pre-existing 
disease activity.       
The safety profile of ozanimod in the RMS population did not present with any unexpected findings as 
compared to other S1P receptor modulators, namely fingolimod and the recently approved siponimod. 
Fingolimod  was  authorised  more  than  8  years  ago  in  the  EU  and  risk  minimisation  measures  proved 
efficacious  for  the  indication  of  highly  active  RRMS.  Siponimod  was  recently  granted  approval  for 
treatment of adult patients with SPMS with active disease. Siponimod, although indicated for treatment 
of a later stage of MS, presented with a qualitatively similar safety profile as compared to fingolimod and 
ozanimod.  
The amount of clinical trial safety data of fingolimod and siponimod and post-marketing experience with 
fingolimod  appears  reassuring  that  the  safety  of  ozanimod  is  likewise  manageable  with  similar 
precautionary  measures  in  place  in  the  product  information  and  post-authorisation  safety  measures. 
More specifically, ozanimod with the proposed titration scheme to the therapeutic dosage does not raise 
particular concerns on the cardiovascular system.  Patients with severe cardiac pre-morbid conditions 
were  excluded  from  clinical  studies  and  are  likewise  to  be  excluded  from  treatment  with  ozanimod 
(contraindication in section 4.3). In other less severe instances of cardiovascular impairment, cardiologist 
advice should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment.  
Notwithstanding, and similar to other S1P receptor modulators, there are other relevant safety concerns 
with chronic ozanimod use, i.e. pronounced lymphopenia that increases the risk for serious/ opportunistic 
infections,  elevation  of  liver  enzymes  that  may  be  problematic  for  patients  with  pre-existing  hepatic 
conditions,  and  an  increased  risk  of  malignancies,  including  skin  cancers.  The  latter  safety  issue 
especially  emphasised  the  need  for  long-term  follow-up  given  that  carcinogenicity  commonly  takes 
longer than 2 years to express. The determination of the long-term safety risk is still outstanding and 
will  be  further  addressed  in  the  ongoing  long-term  OLE  Study  RPC01-3001  and  in  a  real-world  post 
marketing study. 
During the procedure, the CHMP thoroughly discussed the safety profile of ozanimod as a key aspect to 
determine whether the benefit-risk balance can be considered positive for the broad indication of RRMS 
patients as requested by the Applicant or whether a restriction to highly active RRMS patients would be 
more appropriate. In order to bring crucial perspectives from physicians and patients to the discussions 
on  this  particular  aspect,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  SAG-N  meeting  including  MS  experts  and 
patients’ representatives.

The SAG-N experts agreed that safety concerns are expected to be similar to the ones reported for other 
immunosuppressant  therapies.  As  such,  risks  cannot  be  neglected  but  are  considered  manageable  in 
clinical practice using similar measures to the ones implemented for other highly efficacy DMT including 
Fingolimod.  Regarding  the  risks,  the  SAG-N  experts  highlighted  the  importance  of  teratogenicity, 
rebound after cessation of treatment and long-term malignancy. All these risks were currently proposed 
as important potential risks for ozanimod and as such will be subject of further investigations during the 
post-marketing  phase,  while  comprehensive  precautionary  wording  was  implemented  in  the  product 
information. 
When considering benefit-risk assessment of a given medical product for a target population, efficacy, 
safety  and  quality  of  the  medical  product  are  thoroughly  assessed  by  CHMP.  Due  to  the rather  short 
observation periods of pivotal studies, long-term effects are difficult to evaluate, and long-term studies 
are recommended.  
Taking into consideration all post-marketing experience (including studies but also clinical practice) with 
DMT in patients with MS, there is an increasing evidence supporting an early and efficacious intervention 
in  the  early  phase  of  MS  for  maintaining  neurological  function  over  a  lifetime  in  patients  with  MS 
(Ziemssen et al, 2016). Indeed, the therapeutic management of MS has substantially evolved over the 
last  years  and  current  evidence  supports  treatment  optimization  including  an  early  intervention  with 
efficacious therapies. This position was specifically acknowledged by the SAG experts who confirmed that 
there is a trend towards an earlier use of highly effective DMT including Fingolimod in the early stages 
of  RMS  to  attain  a  more  favourable  outcome  in  patients.  In  this  regard,  the  evolution  of  the  clinical 
management could favour a broad indication of Ozanimod (SAG-N minutes). A majority of SAG experts 
openly  expressed  their  preference  for  using  highly  active  DMT  in  a  more  liberal  scenario,  which  is 
currently not feasible, mostly due to reimbursement restrictions based on labeling. Specific mention was 
done for Fingolimod for which it was noted that present reimbursement rules prevent early use in several 
member  countries  (SAG-N  minutes).  In  the  view  of  the  SAG-N  experts,  a  restriction  of  the  target 
population to highly active RRMS based on the safety profile would not be justified. Overall, the SAG 
experts expressed the view that a broad indication for active RRMS could be considered for Ozanimod 
but  only  patients  with  active  disease  should  be  treated.  Patient’s  representatives  expressed  the  view 
that overall patients will likely be willing to assume these risks provided they are well-balanced with the 
expected efficacy, and they receive a straightforward information regarding long-term risks. 
With the totality of clinical trial data for ozanimod, the changing treatment strategies with a trend towards 
an earlier use of highly effective DMT in clinical practice over the last years since approval of the first 
(oral) non-selective S1P receptor modulator, and the fact that the safety profile of ozanimod is at least 
not  worse  compared  to  that  of  fingolimod  and  manageable,  which  was  further  supported  by  SAG-N 
experts, the unrestricted indication is considered fully justified.

Information on where to find latest Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
• 
•  Healthcare Professional checklist; 
• 
• 
Patient/Caregiver’s guide; 
Pregnancy-specific patient reminder card. 
Healthcare Professional Checklist 
The Healthcare Professional checklist shall contain the following key messages: 
•  Dose escalation at treatment initiation 
o  Start treatment with 0.23 mg once daily on Days 1-4, then increase the dose to 0.46 mg 
once daily on Days 5-7. Following the 7-day dose escalation, the maintenance dose is 0.92 
mg once daily, starting on Day 8. 
•  Re-initiation of therapy following treatment interruption 
o  The  same  dose  escalation  regimen  described  above  is  recommended  when  treatment  is 
interrupted for: 
o  1 day or more during the first 14 days of treatment. 
o  more than 7 consecutive days between Day 15 and Day 28 of treatment. 
o  more than 14 consecutive days after Day 28 of treatment. 
If  the  treatment  interruption  is  of  shorter  duration  than  the  above,  the  treatment  should  be 
continued with the next dose as planned. 
• 
•  Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: 
Before first dose 
o  Perform baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to the first dose of Zeposia; 
o  Consider  recent  (within  last  6  months)  liver  function  test  results  for  transaminase  and 
bilirubin levels; 
o  Consider  recent  (within  6  months  or  after  discontinuation  of  prior  MS  therapy)  complete 
blood cell count results, including lymphocyte count; 
o  Arrange  ophthalmological  assessment  before  starting  Zeposia  treatment  in  patients  with 
diabetes mellitus, uveitis, or a history of retinal disease. 
o  A negative pregnancy test result in women of childbearing potential must be confirmed prior 
to starting Zeposia treatment. 
          Until 6 hours after first dose for patients requiring first dose observation 
o 
In patients with certain pre-existing cardiac conditions (resting heart rate <55 bpm, second-
degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure) 
o  Monitor  for  6  hours  after  the  first  dose  of  Zeposia  for  signs  and  symptoms  of 
symptomatic bradycardia, with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement  
o  Perform an ECG prior to and at the end of the 6-hour monitoring period. 
o  Extended monitoring may be required in the following situations 
o  heart rate less than 45 bpm 
o  heart rate is the lowest value post-dose, suggesting that the maximum decrease in 
heart rate may not have occurred yet 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/199869/2020  
Page 184/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  evidence of a new onset second-degree or higher AV block at the 6- hour post-dose 
ECG 
o  QTc interval ≥500 msec. 
•  When initiating Zeposia in patients with: 
o  History  of  cardiac  arrest,  cerebrovascular  disease,  uncontrolled  hypertension,  or  severe 
untreated sleep apnoea, history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia; 
o  Pre-existing significant QT interval prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec.) or other risks 
for  QT  prolongation,  and  patients  on  medicinal  products  other  than  beta-blockers  and 
calcium-channel blockers that may potentiate bradycardia; 
o  Current  class  Ia  (eg,  quinidine,  disopyramide)  or  class  III  (eg,  amiodarone,  sotalol) 
antiarrhythmic medicinal products; 
A cardiologist should be consulted before initiating Zeposia to determine if Zeposia can safely be 
initiated and to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy. 
•  Caution should be taken when initiating Zeposia in patients taking medicines known to decrease 
heart rate. 
•  Zeposia is contraindicated in patients with: 
Immunodeficient state predisposing to systemic opportunistic infections; 
o 
o  Severe active infections, active chronic infections such as hepatitis and tuberculosis; 
o  Active malignancies; 
o  Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C); 
o  Myocardial 
ischaemic  attack, 
decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalisation or New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
Class III/IV heart failure in the last 6 months; 
infarction  (MI),  unstable  angina,  stroke, 
transient 
o  History or presence of second-degree AV block Type II or third-degree AV block or sick sinus 
syndrome unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker; 
o  During pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception; 
o  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
•  Zeposia reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC) should 
be  checked  in  all  patients  prior  to  initiation  (within  6  months  or  after  discontinuation  of  prior 
therapy)  and  monitored  periodically  during  treatment  with  Zeposia  Treatment  should  be 
interrupted if lymphocyte count is confirmed as <0.2 x 109/l and the re-initiation of Zeposia can 
be considered if the level reaches > 0.5 x 109/l. 
•  Zeposia has an immunosuppressive effect that predisposes patients to a risk of infection, including 
opportunistic infections, and may increase the risk of developing malignancies, including those of 
the  skin.  Patients  should  be  carefully  monitored,  especially  those  with  concurrent  conditions  or 
known  factors,  such  as  previous  immunosuppressive  therapy.  If  this  risk  is  suspected, 
discontinuation of treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
o  Treatment  initiation  in  patients  with  severe  active  infection  should  be  delayed  until  the 
infection  is  resolved.  Interruption  of  treatment  during  serious  infections  should  be 
considered.  Anti-neoplastic,  immunomodulatory,  or  non-corticosteroid  immunosuppressive 
therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of additive immune system effects.  
o  Vigilance for basal cell carcinoma and other cutaneous neoplasms is recommended. Caution 
patients  against  exposure  to  sunlight  without  protection.  Patients  should  not  receive 
concomitant phototherapy with UV-B-radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy. 
• 
Patients  should  be  instructed  to  report  signs  and  symptoms  of  infections  immediately  to  their 
prescriber during and for up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. 
o  Prompt  diagnostic  evaluation  should  be  performed  in  patients  with  symptoms  of  infection 
while receiving, or within 3 months of stopping, treatment with Zeposia  
Assessment report

o  Prescribers  should  be  vigilant  for  clinical  symptoms  including  unexpected  neurological  or 
psychiatric  symptoms  or  MRI  findings  suggestive  of  PML.  If  PML  is  suspected  a  complete 
physical and neurological examination (including the possibility of performing an MRI) should 
be performed and treatment with Zeposia should be withheld until PML has been excluded. 
If PML is confirmed, treatment with Zeposia should be discontinued. 
o  The  use  of  live  attenuated  vaccines  should  be  avoided  during  and  for  3  months  after 
discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. Check varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody status 
in patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of varicella or documentation 
of a full course of varicella vaccination. If negative, VZV vaccination is recommended at least 
1 month prior to treatment initiation with Zeposia.  
•  Zeposia  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
effective contraception. 
o  A negative pregnancy test result must be confirmed prior to starting treatment in women of 
childbearing potential. It must be repeated at suitable intervals. 
o  Women of  childbearing potential  should  be  informed  before  treatment initiation  about  the 
risks of Zeposia to the foetus, facilitated by the pregnancy-specific patient reminder card. 
o  Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during Zeposia treatment 
and for at least 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. 
o  Zeposia should be stopped 3 months before planning a pregnancy. 
o  While on treatment, women must not become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant while 
on treatment, Zeposia must be discontinued. Medical advice should be given regarding the 
risk of harmful effects to the foetus associated with Zeposia treatment and ultrasonography 
examinations should be performed. 
o  Disease  activity  may  possibly  return  when  treatment  with  Zeposia  is  stopped  due  to 
pregnancy or planning a pregnancy. 
• 
Liver function (transaminase and bilirubin levels) should be monitored at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 
during Zeposia therapy and periodically thereafter. 
•  Blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with Zeposia. 
• 
• 
Patient  who  present  with  visual  symptoms  of  macular  oedema  should  be  evaluated  and,  if 
confirmed,  treatment  with  ozanimod  should  be  discontinued.  Patients  with  diabetes  mellitus, 
uveitis  or  a  history  of  retinal  disease  should  undergo  an  ophthalmological  evaluation  prior  to 
treatment initiation with ozanimod and have follow up evaluations while receiving therapy.  
Prescribers  should  provide  patients/caregivers  with  the  patient/caregiver  guide  and  with  the 
pregnancy-specific patient reminder card  
Patient/Caregiver’s Guide 
The patient/caregiver’s guide shall contain the following key messages: 
•  What Zeposia is and how it works; 
•  What multiple sclerosis is; 
• 
Patients should read the package leaflet thoroughly before starting treatment and should keep it 
in case they need to refer to it again during treatment; 
Importance of reporting adverse reactions; 
Patients should have a baseline ECG prior to receiving the first dose of Zeposia.  
• 
• 
•  Zeposia should not be used if you have had a heart attack, angina, stroke or mini-stroke (transient 
ischaemic attack), or certain types of severe heart failure in the last 6 months or if you have certain 
types of irregular or abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmia) – your doctor will check your heart before 
starting  treatment.  Caution  should  be  taken  with  concomitant  use  of  medicines  that  slow  your 
heart  rate.  Therefore,  patients  should  tell  any  doctor  they  see  that  they  are  being  treated  with 
Zeposia.

For patients with certain heart conditions heart rate should be monitored for 6 or more hours after 
the first dose of Zeposia, including hourly pulse and blood pressure checks. An ECG before and 
after the 6 hours should also be performed for these patients. 
Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, vertigo, 
nausea, or palpitations) after the first dose of Zeposia; 
Patients  should  inform  their  prescriber  in  case  of  treatment  interruption,  as  the  initial  dose 
escalation regimen may need to be repeated, depending on duration of interruption and time since 
initiation of Zeposia treatment; 
Patients should report any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (such as sudden 
onset  of  severe  headache,  confusion,  seizures  and  vision  changes)  or  accelerated  neurological 
deterioration to their doctors; 
Patients  are  recommended  to  have  varicella  zoster  (chickenpox)  vaccination  1  month  before 
starting Zeposia treatment, if the patient is not protected and wants to be protected against the 
virus; 
•  Signs and symptoms of infection, which should be immediately reported to the prescriber during 
and up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia; 
•  Any symptoms of visual impairment should be reported immediately to the prescriber during and 
for up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia; 
•  Zeposia  must  not  be used  during  pregnancy  or  in  women of  childbearing  potential  who  are  not 
using effective contraception. Women of childbearing potential should: 
o  Be informed about serious risks to the foetus;  
o  Have  a  negative  pregnancy  test  before  starting  Zeposia.  It  must  be  repeated  at  suitable 
intervals; 
o  Be informed about the requirement of using effective contraception during and for at least 
3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia; 
o  Be  informed  that  disease  activity  may  possibly  return  when  treatment  with  Zeposia  is 
stopped due to pregnancy or planning a pregnancy; 
o  Report immediately to the prescriber any (intended or unintended) pregnancy during and up 
to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with Zeposia. Ultrasonography examinations 
should be offered if needed; 
•  A  liver  function test  should  be  performed  prior  to  treatment  initiation;  liver  function  monitoring 
should be performed at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 during Zeposia therapy, and should be performed 
periodically thereafter; 
•  Blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with Zeposia; 
•  Zeposia may increase the risk of skin cancer. Patients should limit their exposure to sun light and 
UV (ultraviolet) light, by wearing protective clothing and applying regular sunscreen (with high sun 
protection factor). 
Pregnancy-specific Patient Reminder Card 
The  pregnancy-specific  patient  reminder  card  (for  women  of  childbearing  potential)  shall  contain  the 
following key messages: 
•  Zeposia  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
effective contraception; 
•  Doctors will provide counselling before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter regarding the 
teratogenic risk of Zeposia and required actions to minimise this risk; 
•  Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception while taking Zeposia and for 3 
months after treatment discontinuation;  
•  A pregnancy test must be carried out and negative results verified by the prescriber before starting 
• 
treatment. It must be repeated at suitable intervals; 
If a woman becomes pregnant while on treatment, ozanimod must be discontinued. Medical advice 
should  be  given  regarding  the  risk  of  harmful  effects  to  the  foetus  associated  with  Zeposia 
treatment and ultrasonography examinations should be performed; 
•  Zeposia should be stopped 3 months before planning a pregnancy; 
•  Disease activity may possibility return when treatment with Zeposia is stopped due to pregnancy 
or planning a pregnancy.

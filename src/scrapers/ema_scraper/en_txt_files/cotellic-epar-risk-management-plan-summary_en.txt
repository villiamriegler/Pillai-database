PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for COTELLIC (COBIMETINIB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Cotellic. The RMP details 
important risks of Cotellic, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Cotellic risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Cotellic summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Cotellic should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Cotellic should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Cotellic’s RMP. 
I.  THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Cotellic is authorized for use in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600. It contains 
cobimetinib as the active substance and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Cotellic’s benefits can be found in Cotellic’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Cotellic, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Cotellic’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorized pack sizethe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal statusthe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events (AEs) is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Cotellic is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing Information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Cotellic are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Cotellic. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk: Ocular events related to serous retinopathy (e.g., retinal 
detachment 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Serous retinopathy (fluid accumulation within the layers of the 
retina) has been observed in patients treated with MEK-
inhibitors, including Cotellic. Well-controlled randomized 
clinical trial (Study GO28141) showed that more patients had 
ocular events (the majority of which were reported as 
chorioretinopathy or retinal detachment) in comparison to 
patients who did not. 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Serous retinopathy is considered a class effect for MEK 
inhibitors.

Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) 
PL: 
Section 2 (What you need to know before you take Cotellic) 
Section 4 (Possible side effects) 
Routine risk minimization activities recommending 
specific clinical measures to address the risk: 
Patients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new 
or worsening visual disturbances. If symptoms of new or 
worsening visual disturbances are identified, an 
ophthalmologic examination is recommended. If serous 
retinopathy is diagnosed, Cotellic treatment should be withheld 
until visual symptoms improve to Grade ≤1. Serous 
retinopathy can be managed with treatment interruption, dose 
reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in 
section 4.2). This has been adequately captured in Section 4.4 
of EU SmPC.

Important identified risk: Left ventricular dysfunction (including decreased LVEF and

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 
baseline has been reported in patients receiving Cotellic. In 
well controlled randomized clinical trial GO28141, median time 
to initial onset of events was 4 months (1-13 months). The 
majority of the events were Grade 1 or 2. 
General risk factors for decreased LVEF include family or 
individual history of cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, prior 
treatment with cytotoxic drugs, including anthracyclines, is 
known to induce cardiomyopathy-related ADRs. However, 
given the current clinical data for cobimetinib, specific risk 
groups or factors were not identified.

In the well-controlled randomized clinical trial GO28141, one 
event of rhabdomyolysis was reported in a patient treated with 
cobimetinib  vemurafenib, and rhabdomyolysis has been 
reported in postmarketing experience. 
Laboratory elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of all 
grades were reported as an AE in 33.2% of patients treated 
with cobimetinib  vemurafenib (in the integrated safety 
population), of which 5.6% were Grade 3 and 3.2% were 
Grade 4. In Study GO28141, there were 11 patients (4.5%) in 
the cobimetinib  vemurafenib arm and 1 patient (0.4%) in the 
placebo  vemurafenib arm that presented with Grade 4 
increased CPK. The majority of CPK elevations reported is 
asymptomatic, non-serious, and resolved with or without study 
drug interruption. 
None yet identified.

Evidence for linking the

Safety in patients with cardiac impairment is need of further 
characterization, as patients with cardiac impairment have not

been studied in clinical trials. Additionally, congestive heart 
failure is one of the most common comorbidities in the target 
population of metastatic melanoma for patients 65 years or 
older, and left ventricular dysfunction (including decreased 
LVEF and cardiomyopathy) is considered an important 
identified risk for cobimetinib. Therefore, the missing 
information is relevant in clinical practice.

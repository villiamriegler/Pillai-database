When used with other ophthalmic medicines, an interval of ten minutes should be allowed between 
applications of each medicinal product. Eye ointments should be administered last. 
Elderly population 
EMADINE has not been studied in elderly patients older than 65 years, and therefore its use is not 
recommended in this population. 
Paediatric population 
EMADINE may be used in paediatric patients (3 years of age and older) at the same posology as in 
adults. 
Hepatic and Renal impairment Use 
EMADINE has not been studied in these patients and therefore, its use is not recommended in this 
population. 
Method of administration 
For ocular use.

To prevent contamination of the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch the 
eyelids, surrounding areas or other surfaces with the dropper tip of the bottle. 
After cap is removed, if tamper evident snap collar is loose, remove before using product. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Ocular corneal infiltrates 
Ocular corneal infiltrates were reported in conjunction with the use of EMADINE. In case of corneal 
infiltrates, the product should be discontinued and appropriate management should be implemented. 
Excipients 
Benzalkonium chloride, which is commonly used as a preservative in ophthalmic products, has been 
reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. Since EMADINE contains 
benzalkonium chloride, close monitoring is required with frequent or prolonged use. 
In addition benzalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact 
lenses. Contact with soft contact lenses is to be avoided. Patients must be instructed to remove contact 
lenses prior to the application of EMADINE and wait 15 minutes after instillation of the dose before 
reinsertion. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of emedastine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Nevertheless, 
considering the absence of effects of emedastine on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors, 
EMADINE can be used during pregnancy if the dosage recommendation in section 4.2 is respected. 
Breast-feeding 
Emedastine has been identified in the milk of rats following oral administration. It is not known 
whether topical administration to humans could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce 
detectable quantities in breast milk. Caution should be exercised if EMADINE is administered during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown no evidence of impaired fertility (See Section 5.3). No human fertility 
data are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
EMADINE has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines, however as with 
any ocular medication, if transient blurred vision or other visual disturbance occurs at instillation, the 
patient should wait until the vision clears before driving or using machinery.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
In 13 clinical studies involving 696 patients, Emadine was administered one to four times daily in both 
eyes for up to 42 days. In clinical trials, approximately 7% of patients experienced an adverse drug 
reaction associated with the use of Emadine; however, less than 1% of these patients discontinued 
therapy due to these adverse drug reactions. No serious ophthalmic or systemic adverse drug reactions 
were reported in the clinical trials. The most common adverse drug reactions were eye pain and eye 
pruritus occurring in 1% to 2.0% of patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions listed below were observed in clinical studies or with post marketing 
experience. They are ranked according to system organ class and classified according to the following 
convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000), or not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of 
seriousness.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
No specific reactions are to be expected with an ocular overdose of the product. 
No data are available in humans regarding overdose by accidental or deliberate ingestion. In case of 
accidental ingestion of the content of a bottle of EMADINE, sedative effects may occur and the 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential of emedastine to increase the QT interval should be borne in mind and appropriate 
monitoring and management should be implemented. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: decongestants and antiallergics; other antiallergics, ATC code: S01G X 
06 
Emedastine is a potent selective and topically effective histamine H1 antagonist (Ki = 1.3 nM). In vitro 
examinations of emedastine’s affinity for histamine receptors (H1, H2, and H3) demonstrate 
10,000-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor, Ki’s = 1.3 nM, 49,064 nM and 12, 430 nM, respectively. In 
vivo topical ocular administration of emedastine produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of 
histamine-stimulated conjunctival vascular permeability. Studies with emedastine have not shown 
effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonin receptors. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Emedastine is absorbed systemically, as are other topically administered drug substances. In a study 
involving ten normal volunteers dosed bilaterally twice daily for 15 days with EMADINE 0.5 mg/ml 
eye drops solution, plasma concentrations of the parent compound were generally below the 
quantitation limit of the assay (0.3 ng/ml). Samples in which emedastine was quantifiable ranged from 
0.30 to 0.49 ng/ml. 
The human oral bioavailability of emedastine is approximately 50% and maximum plasma 
concentrations were achieved within one-two hours after dosing. 
Biotransformation 
Emedastine is principally metabolised by the liver. The elimination half-life of topical emedastine is 
ten hours. Approximately 44% of an oral dose is recovered in the urine over 24 hours, with only 
3.6% of the dose excreted as parent drug substance. Two primary metabolites, 5-and 
6-hydroxyemedastine, are excreted in the urine as both free and conjugated forms. The 5′-oxo 
analogues of 5-and 6-hydroxyemedastine and the N-oxide are also formed as minor metabolites. 
5.3  Preclinical Safety Data 
Emedastine difumarate demonstrated low acute toxicity in a number of species by various routes of 
administration. No clinically significant local or systemic effects were observed in long-term topical 
ocular studies in rabbits. 
Corneal limbal mononuclear cell infiltrates were noted in 1/4 male monkeys treated with 0.5 mg/ml 
and in 4/4 males and 1/4 females treated with1.0 mg/ml. Scleral mononuclear cell infiltrates were 
present in 1/4 males and 1/4 females treated with 0.5 mg/ml and in 2/4 males and 1/4 females treated 
with1.0 mg/ml. Mean peak plasma levels were approximately 1 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml for the 0.5 and 
1.0 mg/ml treatments respectively. 
Emedastine was found to increase the QT interval in dogs; the NOEL corresponds to levels 23-fold 
higher than those found in patients (7 ng/ml as compared with 0.3 ng/ml, i.e., the limit of detection for 
emedastine). 
Emedastine difumarate was not found to be carcinogenic in studies in mice and rats. Emedastine 
difumarate was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a teratology study in rats, foetotoxic but not teratogenic effects were observed at the highest dose 
evaluated (140 mg/kg/day); no effects were observed at a lower level (40 mg/kg/day) which 
corresponds to an exposure well in excess of that produced by the therapeutic recommended dose. No 
reproductive toxicity was observed in a study in rabbits. 
There was no evidence of impaired fertility or decreased reproductive capacity in rats administered 
oral dosages of Emedastine difumarate of up to 30 mg/kg/day.

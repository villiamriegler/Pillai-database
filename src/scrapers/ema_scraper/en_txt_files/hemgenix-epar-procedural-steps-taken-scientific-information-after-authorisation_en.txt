The CAT and CHMP, having reviewed the available 
information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific 
Obligations and having confirmed the positive benefit risk 
balance, is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continue to be adequately 
and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends 
the renewal of the conditional MA for Hemgenix, subject to 
the Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in 
Annex II to the opinion.

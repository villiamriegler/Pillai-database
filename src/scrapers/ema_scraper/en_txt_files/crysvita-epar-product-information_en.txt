Posology 
Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues (e.g. calcitriol) should be discontinued 1 week prior to 
initiation of treatment. Vitamin D replacement or supplementation with inactive forms may be started or 
continued as per local guidelines under monitoring of serum calcium and phosphate. At initiation, 
fasting serum phosphate concentration should be below the reference range for age (see section 4.3).  
X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) 
Dosing in Children and Adolescents with XLH aged 1 to 17 years  
The recommended starting dose in children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years is 0.8 mg/kg of body 
weight given every two weeks. Doses should be rounded to the nearest 10 mg. The maximum dose is 
90 mg. 
After initiation of treatment with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate should be measured every 
2 weeks for the first month of treatment, every 4 weeks for the following 2 months and thereafter as 
appropriate. Fasting serum phosphate should also be measured 2 weeks after any dose adjustment. 
If fasting serum phosphate is within the reference range for age, the same dose should be maintained. 
Dose increase 
If fasting serum phosphate is below the reference range for age, the dose may be increased stepwise by 
0.4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg (maximum dose of 90 mg). Fasting serum phosphate 
should be measured 2 weeks after dose adjustment. Burosumab should not be adjusted more frequently 
than every 4 weeks. 
Dose decrease  
If fasting serum phosphate is above the reference range for age, the next dose should be withheld and 
the fasting serum phosphate reassessed within 2 weeks. The patient must have fasting serum phosphate 
below the reference range for age to restart burosumab at half of the previous dose, rounding the amount 
as described above.  
Dose Conversion at age 18 years 
Children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years should be treated using the dosing guidance outlined above. 
At 18 years of age the patient should convert to the adult dose and dosing regimen as outlined below. 
Dosing in Adults with XLH 
The recommended starting dose in adults is 1.0 mg/kg of body weight, rounded to the nearest 10 mg up 
to a maximum dose of 90 mg, given every 4 weeks.  
After initiation of treatment with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate should be measured every 
2 weeks for the first month of treatment, every 4 weeks for the following 2 months and thereafter as 
appropriate. Fasting serum phosphate should be measured 2 weeks after the previous dose of 
burosumab. If serum phosphate is within the normal range, the same dose should be continued.  
Dose decrease 
If serum phosphate is above the upper limit of normal range, the next dose should be withheld and the 
serum phosphate level reassessed within 2 weeks. The patient must have serum phosphate below the 
normal range before restarting burosumab. Once serum phosphate is below the normal range, treatment 
may be restarted at half the initial starting dose up to a maximum dose of 40 mg every 4 weeks. Serum 
phosphate should be reassessed 2 weeks after any change in dose. 
Tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) 
The posology in children and adolescents with TIO aged 1 to 17 years has been determined from 
pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (see section 5.2) 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dosing in Children with TIO aged 1 to 12 years 
The recommended starting dose for children aged 1 to 12 years is 0.4 mg/kg of body weight, given 
every 2 weeks. Doses should be rounded to the nearest 10 mg. The maximum dose is 90 mg. 
Dose increase 
If serum phosphate is below the reference range for age, the dose may be increased in a stepwise 
manner. Doses should be increased by an initial increment of 0.6 mg/kg with subsequent increments, 
depending on patient’s response to treatment, of 0.5 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg), 
rounding the amount as described above, up to a maximum dose of 90 mg, given every 2 weeks. Fasting 
serum phosphate should be measured 2 weeks after dose adjustment. Burosumab should not be adjusted 
more frequently than every 4 weeks. 
Dosing in Adolescents with TIO aged 13 to 17 years 
The recommended starting dose for adolescents aged 13 to 17 years is 0.3 mg/kg of body weight, given 
every 2 weeks. Doses should be rounded to the nearest 10 mg. The maximum dose is 180 mg. 
Dose increase 
If serum phosphate is below the reference range for age, the dose may be increased in a stepwise 
manner. Doses should be increased by an initial increment of 0.3 mg/kg with subsequent increments of 
between 0.2 mg/kg – 0.5 mg/kg (dose increment dependent on the patient’s serum phosphate response 
to treatment), rounding the amount as described above, up to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg (maximum 
dose 180 mg), given every 2 weeks. Fasting serum phosphate should be measured 2 weeks after dose 
adjustment. Burosumab should not be adjusted more frequently than every 4 weeks. 
Dosing in Children and Adolescents with TIO aged 1 to 17 years  
For all paediatric patients, after initiation of treatment with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate should 
be measured every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment, every 4 weeks for the following 2 months 
and thereafter as appropriate. Fasting serum phosphate should also be measured 2 weeks after any dose 
adjustment. If fasting serum phosphate is within the reference range for age, the same dose should be 
maintained. 
Dose decrease 
If serum phosphate is above the reference range for age, the next dose should be withheld and the 
fasting serum phosphate level reassessed in 2 weeks. Once serum phosphate is below the reference 
range for age, treatment may be restarted at half the previous dose in rounding the amount as described 
above. The fasting serum phosphate level should be assessed 2 weeks after the dose adjustment. If the 
level remains below the reference range for age after the re-started dose, the dose can be further 
adjusted. 
Dose Conversion at age 18 years 
At 18 years of age the patient should convert to the adult dose and dosing regimen as outlined below. 
Dosing in Adults with TIO 
The recommended starting dose for adults is 0.3 mg/kg body weight, rounded to the nearest 10 mg, 
given every 4 weeks.  
After initiation of treatment with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate should be measured 2 weeks after 
each dose for the first 3 months of treatment, and thereafter as appropriate. If serum phosphate is within 
the reference range, the same dose should be maintained .  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose increase 
If serum phosphate is below the reference range, the dose may be increased in a stepwise manner. Doses 
should be increased by an initial increment of 0.3 mg/kg, with subsequent increments of between 0.2 
mg/kg – 0.5 mg/kg (dose dependent on the patient’s response to treatment), up to a maximum dose of 
2.0 mg/kg (maximum dose 180 mg), given every 4 weeks. Fasting serum phosphate should be measured 
2 weeks after dose adjustment.  
For patients whose serum phosphate still remains below the reference range, despite providing the 
maximum dose every 4 weeks, the previous dose may be divided and given every 2 weeks, with 
incremental increases as required, as outlined above, up to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
(maximum dose 180 mg). 
Dose decrease 
If serum phosphate is above the reference range, the next dose should be withheld and the fasting serum 
phosphate level reassessed in 2 weeks. The patient must have serum phosphate below the reference 
range before restarting burosumab. Once serum phosphate is below the reference range, treatment may 
be restarted at approximately half the previous dose, administered every 4 weeks. Serum phosphate 
should be reassessed 2 weeks after any change in dose. 
If the level remains below the reference range after the re-started dose, the dose can be further adjusted. 
Dose Interruption in paediatric and adult patients with TIO  
If a patient undergoes treatment of the underlying tumour (i.e., surgical excision or radiation therapy) 
burosumab treatment should be interrupted.  
Following completion of the treatment of the underlying tumour, serum phosphate should be reassessed 
before reinitiating treatment with burosumab. Burosumab treatment should be resumed at the patient’s 
original starting dose if serum phosphate level remains below the lower end of the normal reference 
range. Follow the recommended dose adjustment outlined above to maintain serum phosphate level 
within the normal reference range for age. 
For all patients with TIO, treatment should be discontinued if the treating physician considers that no 
meaningful improvement in biochemical or clinical markers of response are observed, despite the 
maximum dose being administered.  
All Patients 
To decrease the risk for ectopic mineralisation, it is recommended that fasting serum phosphate is 
targeted in the lower end of the normal reference range for age (see section 4.4). 
Missed dose  
Treatments may be administered 3 days either side of the scheduled treatment date if needed for 
practical reasons. If a patient misses a dose, burosumab should be resumed as soon as possible at the 
prescribed dose. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Burosumab has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Burosumab must not be given to 
patients with severe or end stage renal disease (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric population 
X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) 
The safety and efficacy of burosumab in paediatric patients with XLH aged less than one year have not 
been established in clinical studies.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) 
The safety and efficacy of burosumab in paediatric patients with TIO have not been established in 
clinical studies.  
Elderly  
Limited data is available in patients over 65 years of age.  
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
Burosumab should be injected in the upper arm, abdomen, buttock or thigh. 
The maximum volume of medicinal product per injection site is 1.5 ml. If more than 1.5 ml is required 
on a given dosing day, the total volume of medicinal product must be split and administered at two or 
more different injection sites. Injection sites should be rotated and carefully monitored for signs of 
potential reactions (see section 4.4).  
For handling of burosumab before administration, see section 6.6. 
For some patients, self/carer-administration may be suitable. Once no immediate dose modifications are 
anticipated, the administration can be performed by an individual who has been trained in injection 
techniques. The first self-administered dose after drug initiation or dose change should be conducted 
under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Clinical monitoring of the patient, including 
monitoring of phosphate levels, must continue as required and as outlined below. A detailed 
‘Instructions for Use’ section intended for the patient is provided at the end of the Package Leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Concurrent administration with oral phosphate, active vitamin D analogues (see section 4.5). 
Fasting serum phosphate above the normal range for age due to the risk of hyperphosphatemia (see 
section 4.4). 
Patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded within the patient’s records. 
Ectopic mineralisation 
Ectopic mineralisation, as manifested by nephrocalcinosis, has been observed in patients with XLH 
treated with oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues; these medicinal products should be stopped 
at least 1 week prior to initiating burosumab treatment (see section 4.2). 
Monitoring for signs and symptoms of nephrocalcinosis, e.g. by renal ultrasonography, is recommended 
at the start of treatment and every 6 months for the first 12 months of treatment, and annually thereafter. 
Monitoring of plasma alkaline phosphatase, calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and creatinine is 
recommended every 6 months (every 3 months for children 1 - 2 years) or as indicated. 
Monitoring of urine calcium and phosphate is suggested every 3 months.

Hyperphosphataemia 
Levels of fasting serum phosphate should be monitored due to the risk of hyperphosphatemia. To 
decrease the risk for ectopic mineralisation, it is recommended that fasting serum phosphate is targeted 
in the lower end of the normal reference range for age. Dose interruption and/or dose reduction may be 
required (see section 4.2). Periodic measurement of post prandial serum phosphate is advised. 
To prevent hyperphosphataemia, treatment with burosumab should be interrupted in patients with 
tumour-induced osteomalacia who undergo treatment of the underlying tumour. Burosumab treatment 
should be reinitiated only if the patient’s serum phosphate level remains below the lower end of the 
normal reference range (see Section 4.2). 
Serum parathyroid hormone 
Increases in serum parathyroid hormone have been observed in some XLH patients during treatment 
with burosumab. Periodic measurement of serum parathyroid hormone is advised. 
Injection site reactions 
Administration of burosumab may result in local injection site reactions. Administration should be 
interrupted in any patient experiencing severe injection site reactions (see section 4.8) and appropriate 
medical therapy administered. 
Hypersensitivity 
Burosumab must be discontinued if serious hypersensitivity reactions occur and appropriate medical 
treatment should be initiated. 
Excipient with known effect 
This medicine contains 45.91 mg of sorbitol in each vial which is equivalent to 45.91 mg/ml.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concurrent administration of burosumab with oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues is 
contraindicated as it may cause an increased risk of hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcaemia (see section 
4.3). 
Caution should be exercised when combining burosumab with calcimimetic medicinal products (i.e. 
agents that mimic the effect of calcium on tissues by activating the calcium receptor). Co-administration 
of these medicinal products has not been studied in clinical trials and could potentially exacerbate 
hypocalcaemia. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of burosumab in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Burosumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether burosumab/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
burosumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown effects on male reproductive organs (see section 5.3). There are no 
clinical data available on the effect of burosumab on human fertility. No specific fertility studies in 
animals with burosumab were conducted. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Burosumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness may occur 
following administration of burosumab. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Injection site reactions 
Paediatric patients with XLH: 
Local reactions (e.g. injection site urticaria, erythema, rash, swelling, bruising, pain, pruritus, and 
haematoma) have occurred at the site of injection. In the paediatric studies, approximately 54% of the 
patients had an injection site reaction, based on data from clinical studies. The injection site reactions 
were generally mild in severity, occurred within 1 day of medicinal product administration, mostly 
lasted 1 to 3 days, required no treatment, and resolved in almost all instances. 
Adult patients with XLH or TIO: 
Injection site reactions were generally mild in severity, required no treatment, and resolved in almost all 
instances. 
In patients with XLH, in the placebo-controlled treatment period of Study UX023-CL303, the frequency 
of injection site reactions was 12% in both burosumab and placebo treatment groups (injection site 
reaction, erythema, rash, bruising, pain, pruritis and haematoma). 
In patients with TIO, the frequency of injection site reactions based on data from completed long term 
clinical studies was 22% (injection site reaction, injection site pain and injection site swelling). 
Hypersensitivity 
Paediatric patients with XLH: 
Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g.: injection site reactions, rash, urticaria, swelling face, dermatitis, etc) 
were reported in 39% of paediatric patients, based on data from clinical studies. All reported reactions 
were mild or moderate in severity. 
Adult patients with XLH or TIO: 
Hypersensitivity reactions were mild or moderate in severity.  
In XLH patients, in the placebo-controlled treatment period of Study UX023-CL303, the incidence of 
potential hypersensitivity reactions was similar (6%) in the burosumab treated and placebo treated 
adults.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with TIO, the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions (rash, drug eruption, and 
hypersensitivity) based on data from completed long term clinical studies was 30%. 
Vitamin D Decreased 
Paediatric patients with XLH: 
Reduced serum 25 hydroxy-vitamin D has been observed following initiation of burosumab treatment in 
approximately 8% of paediatric patients, possibly due to increased conversion to activated 1,25 
dihydroxy-vitamin D. Supplementation with inactive vitamin D was successful in restoring plasma 
levels to normal.  
Hyperphosphataemia 
Adult patients with XLH or TIO: 
In XLH patients, in the placebo-controlled treatment period of Study UX023-CL303 in the burosumab 
group , 9 subjects (13.2%) had high serum phosphate at least once; 5 of these 9 required protocol-
specified dose reduction(s). After initiation of burosumab in the open-label Treatment Continuation 
Period, 8 subjects (12.1%) in the placebo→burosumab group had high serum phosphate levels. Four of 
these 8 subjects required protocol-specified dose reduction(s). The dose for all patients meeting the 
protocol-specified criteria was reduced by 50%. A single patient (1%) required a second dose reduction 
for continued hyperphosphataemia. 
In patients with TIO, based on data from completed long term clinical studies, 11% of patients 
experienced events of hyperphosphataemia, which were managed with dose reduction. 
Restless legs syndrome 
Adult patients with XLH or TIO: 
In XLH patients, in the placebo-controlled treatment period of Study UX023-CL303 approximately 
12% of the burosumab treatment group and 8% in the placebo group had a worsening of baseline 
restless legs syndrome or new onset restless legs syndrome of mild to moderate severity. 
In patients with TIO, based on data from completed long term clinical studies, 11% of patients 
experienced events of restless legs syndrome of mild to moderate severity. 
Immunogenicity:  
Paediatric patients with XLH: 
Overall, the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to burosumab in paediatric patients administered 
burosumab, based on data from clinical studies was 10%. The incidence of neutralising ADA in 
paediatric patients was 3%. No adverse events, loss of efficacy, or changes in the pharmacokinetic 
profile of burosumab were associated with these findings. 
Adult patients with XLH and TIO:  
The incidence of patients that tested positive for ADAs to burosumab in adult clinical studies with XLH 
or TIO, based on data from completed long term clinical studies was 15%. None of these patients 
developed neutralising ADA. No adverse events, loss of efficacy, or changes in the pharmacokinetic 
profile of burosumab were associated with these findings. 
Adverse reactions in paediatric patients with TIO 
No data are available in paediatric patients with TIO (see section 5.1).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose of burosumab. Burosumab has been administered in paediatric 
XLH clinical trials without dose limiting toxicity using doses up to 2.0 mg/kg body weight with a 
maximal dose of 90 mg every two weeks. In adult XLH clinical trials no dose limiting toxicity has been 
observed using doses up to 1.0 mg/kg or a maximal total dose of 128 mg every 4 weeks. In adult TIO 
clinical trials no dose limiting toxicity has been observed using doses up to 2.0 mg/kg or a maximal total 
dose of 184 mg every 4 weeks. 
Management 
In case of overdose, it is recommended to stop burosumab and to monitor biochemical response.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for the treatment of bone diseases, other drugs affecting bone 
structure and mineralisation, ATC code: M05BX05. 
Mechanism of action 
Burosumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds to and inhibits the activity 
of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). By inhibiting FGF23, burosumab increases tubular reabsorption 
of phosphate from the kidney and increases serum concentration of 1,25 dihydroxy-Vitamin D. 
Clinical efficacy in paediatric patients with XLH 
Study UX023-CL301 
In paediatric study UX023-CL301 61 patients aged 1 to 12 years (56% female; 44% male, Age at first 
dose, mean (SD): 6.3 (3.31) years) were randomised to burosumab (n=29) or active control (n=32; oral 
phosphate and active vitamin D). At entry to the study all patients had to have had a minimum of 6 
months treatment of oral phosphate and active vitamin D. All patients had radiographic evidence of 
bone disease due to XLH (Rickets severity score ≥2). Burosumab was started at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks and increased to 1.2 mg/kg if there was inadequate response, as measured by fasting 
serum phosphate. Those patients randomised to active control group received multiple daily doses of 
oral phosphate and active vitamin D.   
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in severity of rickets at Week 40, as assessed by the RGI-
C (Radiographic Global Impression of change) score, compared between the burosumab and active 
control groups.  
The RGI-C is a relative rating scale that compares a patient’s rickets before and after treatment utilising 
a 7-point ordinal scale to evaluate change in the same abnormalities rated in the RSS (as described 
below). Scores range from -3 (indicating severe worsening of rickets) to +3 (indicating complete healing 
of rickets).  
The severity of paediatric rickets was measured using the RSS, a radiographic scoring method based on 
the degree of metaphyseal fraying, concavity, and the proportion of the growth plate affected. In the 
UX023-CL301 study, the RSS was scored using a predefined scale looking at specific abnormalities in 
the wrists and knees.  
All patients (n=61) completed the 64 Week randomised Treatment Period. No patients had dose 
reductions and 8 (28%) of burosumab-treated patients received dose escalations to 1.2 mg/kg. A total of 
51 patients entered the Treatment Extension Period, 26 patients in the active control→burosumab group 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 25 patients in the burosumab→burosumab group, and were treated with burosumab up to 124 
Weeks. 
Primary Efficacy Results 
Greater healing of rickets at Week 40 was seen with burosumab treatment compared to active control 
and this effect was maintained at week 64, as shown in Figure 1. These results were sustained to Week 
88 (n=21).

Serum Phosphate 
At each study visit at which serum phosphate was assessed in both groups, changes in serum phosphate 
from Baseline were larger in the burosumab group compared with the active control group (p < 0.0001; 
GEE model) (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Serum Phosphate Concentration and Change from Baseline (mg/dL) (Mean ± SE) by 
Treatment Group (PD Analysis Set) 
Note: Dashed line in figure indicates the lower limit of the normal serum phosphate reference range, 3.2 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) 
During the Treatment Extension Period (Week 66 to Week 140), prolonger burosumab treatment in both 
groups (burosumab→burosumab (n=25) and active control→burosumab (n=26) the results were 
sustained.  
Study UX023-CL201 
In paediatric Study UX023-CL201, 52 paediatric patients aged 5 to 12 years (mean 8.5 years; SD 1.87) 
with XLH were treated for an initial period of 64 Weeks. and dosed either every two weeks (Q2W) or 
every four weeks (Q4W). This was followed by two extension periods with dosing Q2W for all patients; 
the first period up to 96 Weeks (total 160 Weeks) and a further period of up to 56 Weeks for safety 
analysis. 
Nearly all patients had radiographic evidence of rickets at baseline and had received prior oral 
phosphate and vitamin D analogues for a mean (SD) duration of 7 (2.4) years. This conventional 
therapy was discontinued 2-4 weeks prior to burosumab initiation. The burosumab dose was adjusted to 
target a fasting serum phosphate concentration of 3.50 to 5.02 mg/dL (1.13 to 1.62 mmol/L). In the first 
64 Weeks, 26 of 52 patients received burosumab Q4W. Twenty six of 52 patients received burosumab 
Q2W at an average dose (min, max) of 0.73 (0.3, 1.5), 0.98 (0.4, 2.0) and 1.04 (0.4, 2.0) mg/kg at weeks 
16, 40 and 64 respectively, and up to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg.  
Burosumab increased serum phosphate concentration and increased TmP/GFR. In the Q2W group, 
mean (SD) serum phosphate concentration increased from 2.38 (0.405) mg/dL (0.77 (0.131) mmol/L) at 
baseline), to 3.3 (0.396) mg/dL (1.07 (0.128) mmol/L) at Week 40 and was maintained to Week 64 at 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.35 (0.445) mg/dL (1.08 (0.144) mmol/L). The increased serum phosphate levels were sustained to 
Week 160 (n=52). 
Alkaline phosphatase activity 
Mean (SD) serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was 459 (105) U/L at Baseline and 
decreased to 369 (76) U/L at Week 64 (-19.6%, p < 0.0001); decreases were similar in the two dose 
groups. Overall, decreased serum ALP levels were sustained to Week 160. 
Bone-derived serum alkaline phosphatase (BALP) content was 165 (52) μg/L [mean (SD)] at Baseline 
and 115 (31) μg/L at Week 64 (mean change: -28.5%); decreases were similar in the two dose groups. 
Overall, decreased serum BALP levels were sustained to Week 160. 
In Study UX023-CL201 the severity of paediatric rickets was measured using the RSS, as described 
above, which was scored using a predefined scale looking at specific abnormalities in the wrists and 
knees. As a complement to the RSS assessment, the RGI-C rating scale was used. Results are 
summarised in Table 4.

Study UX023-CL205 
In paediatric Study UX023-CL205, burosumab was evaluated in 13 XLH patients, aged 1 to 
4 years (mean 2.9 years; SD 1.1) for a Treatment Period of 64 Weeks. Twelve patients continued to 
received burosumab for an additional 96 Weeks during the Extension Period, for a maximum duration 
of 160 Weeks. All patients had radiographic evidence of rickets at baseline and 12 patients had received 
oral phosphate and vitamin D analogues for a mean (SD) duration of 16.7 (14.4) months. This 
conventional therapy was discontinued 2-6 weeks prior to burosumab initiation. Patients received 
burosumab at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg every two weeks.  
Mean (SD) fasting serum phosphate concentration increased from 2.51 (0.284) mg/dL (0.81 (0.092) 
mmol/L) at baseline to 3.47 (0.485) mg/dL (1.12 (0.158) mmol/L) at Week 40 and the increased levels 
were sustained to Week 160.

Serum alkaline phosphatase activity 
Mean (SD) serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was 549 (193.8) U/L at baseline and decreased to 
335 (87.6) U/L at Week 40 (mean change: -36.3%). Decreased serum total alkaline phosphatase activity 
was sustained with long-term treatment to Week 160. 
Rickets Severity Score (RSS) 
Mean total RSS improved from 2.92 (1.367) at baseline to 1.19 (0.522) at Week 40, corresponding to a 
change from baseline in LS mean (SE) change of -1.73 (0.132) (p<0.0001). The RSS was sustained to 
Weeks 64, 112 and 160. 
Radiographic Global Impression of Change (RGI-C)  
After 40 weeks of treatment with burosumab, the LS mean (SE) RGI-C Global score was +2.21 (0.071) 
in all 13 patients (p < 0.0001) demonstrating healing of rickets. All 13 patients were considered RGI-C 
responders as defined by RGI-C global score ≥ +2.0. The RGI-C global score was sustained to Weeks 
64, 112, and 160. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
burosumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of X-linked 
hypophosphataemia. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
Clinical efficacy in adults with XLH 
Study UX023-CL303 
Study UX023-CL303 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 134 adult XLH 
patients. The study comprised of a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment phase followed by a 24-week 
open-label period where all patients received burosumab. Oral phosphate and active vitamin D 
analogues were not allowed during the study. Burosumab was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 4 
weeks. The primary endpoint of this study was normalisation of serum phosphate across the 24-week 
double-blind period. Key secondary endpoints included worst pain as measured by the Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI) scale and stiffness and physical function as measured by the WOMAC (Western 
Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis) Index. Exploratory endpoints included fracture and 
pseudofracture healing, enthesopathy, 6 Minute Walk Test, BPI Pain interference, Brief Fatigue 
Inventory (BFI) worst fatigue and BFI global fatigue score.  
At study entry, the mean age of patients was 40 years (range 19 to 66 years) and 35% were 
male. 66 patients were randomised to placebo treatment and 68 to burosumab treatment; at baseline, 
mean (SD) serum phosphate was 0.62 (0.10) mmol/l [1.92 (0.32) mg/dL] and 0.66 (0.1 mmol/l) [2.03 
(0.30) mg/dL] in the placebo and burosumab groups respectively.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, a greater proportion of patients treated with burosumab achieved a 
mean serum phosphate level above the lower limit of normal (LLN) compared to the placebo group 
through week 24 (Table 5 and Figure 3).

Radiographic Evaluation of Fractures and Pseudofractures 
In Study UX023-CL303, a skeletal survey was conducted at baseline to identify osteomalacia-related 
fractures and pseudofractures. There were 52% (70/134) of patients who had either active fractures 
(12%, 16/134) or active pseudofractures (47%, 63/134) at baseline. Following burosumab treatment 
more patients showed healing of fractures and pseudofractures compared to the placebo group 
(Figure 4). During the placebo-controlled treatment period up to week 24, a total of 6 new fractures or 
pseudofractures appeared in 68 patients receiving burosumab compared to 8 new abnormalities in 66 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients receiving placebo. Of the number of new fractures developed prior to week 48 most (10/18) 
were healed or partially healed at the end of the study. 
Figure 4: Percentage of Healed Active Fractures and Pseudofractures in Study UX023-CL303 
At Baseline, the mean (SD) total calcaneal enthesopathy burden (sum of superior and inferior calcaneal 
spurs) was 5.64 (3.12) cm in the burosumab group and 5.54 (3.1) cm in the placebo group. At Week 24, 
the mean (SD) total calcaneal enthesopathy burden was 5.90 (3.56) cm in the burosumab→burosumab 
group and 4.07 (2.38) cm in the placebo→burosumab group.  
For the exploratory endpoints of BPI Pain interference, BFI worst fatigue and BFI global fatigue score 
no meaningful difference were observed between treatment arms. 
Bone Histomorphometry in Adults 
Study UX023-CL304 
Study UX023-CL304 is a 48-week, open-label, single-arm study in adult XLH patients to assess the 
effects of burosumab on improvement of osteomalacia as determined by histologic and 
histomorphometric evaluation of iliac crest bone biopsies. Patients received 1.0 mg/kg burosumab every 
4 weeks. Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues were not allowed during the study. 
14 patients were enrolled, and at study entry, the mean age of patients was 40 years (range 25 to 52 
years) and 43% were male. After 48 weeks of treatment in Study UX023-CL304 paired biopsies were 
available from 11 patients; healing of osteomalacia was observed in all ten evaluable patients as 
demonstrated by decreases in osteoid volume/bone volume (OV/BV) from a mean (SD) score of 26.1% 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(12.4) at baseline to 11.9% (6.6), Osteoid thickness (O.Th) declined in 11 evaluable patients from a 
mean (SD) of 17.2 (4.1) micrometres to 11.6 (3.1) micrometres.  
Clinical Efficacy in adult patients with Tumour-induced osteomalacia 
Burosumab has been evaluated in two single-arm open-label studies which enrolled a total of 27 adult 
patients with TIO. Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues were discontinued between 2-10 
weeks before burosumab treatment was initiated. Patients received burosumab every 4 weeks at a 
weight based starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg to achieve a fasting serum phosphate level of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL 
[0.81 to 1.29 mmol/l]. 
Study UX023T-CL201 enrolled 14 adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of FGF23-related 
hypophosphataemia induced by an underlying tumour that was not amenable to surgical excision or 
could not be located. Eight patients were male and age range for all patients was from 33 years to 68 
years of age (median 59.5 years). The mean (SD) dose of burosumab was 0.83 (0.41) mg/kg at Week 
20, 0.87 (0.49) mg/kg at Week 48, 0.77 (0.52) mg/kg at Week 96 and 0.67 (0.54) mg/kg at Week 144.  
Study KRN23-002 enrolled 13 adult patients from Japan and South Korea with a confirmed diagnosis of 
TIO. Six patients were male and age range for all patients was from 41 years to 73 years of age (median 
58.0 years). The mean (SD) dose of burosumab was 0.91 (0.59) mg/kg at Week 48, and 0.96 (0.70) 
mg/kg at Week 88. 
Serum Phosphate 
In both studies, burosumab increased mean serum phosphate levels and these remained stable 
throughout the study period, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

Radiographic Evaluation  
99mtechnetium-labelled whole body bone scans and x-ray skeletal surveys were conducted at baseline 
and post-treatment up to Week 144 to assess the number of fractures and pseudofractures. A reduction 
in fractures and pseudofractures was observed on both bone scans and x-rays. 
Paediatric patients with TIO 
There are no clinical trials with burosumab in paediatric patients of any age with TIO. The posology of 
burosumab in paediatric TIO patients has been determined from pharmacokinetic modelling and 
simulation (see section 5.2). 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
burosumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of Tumour-induced Osteomalacia. See 
4.2 for information on paediatric use.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Burosumab absorption from subcutaneous injection sites to blood circulation is nearly complete. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the median time to reach maximum serum concentrations (Tmax) 
of burosumab is approximately 7-13 days. The peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of serum burosumab is dose proportional over the dose range of 
0.1-2.0 mg/kg.  
Distribution 
In XLH patients, the observed volume of distribution of burosumab approximates the volume of plasma, 
suggesting limited extravascular distribution. 
Biotransformation 
Burosumab is composed solely of amino acids and carbohydrates as a native immunoglobulin and is 
unlikely to be eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Its metabolism and elimination are 
expected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides 
and individual amino acids.  
Elimination 
Due to its molecular size, burosumab is not expected to be directly excreted. The clearance of 
burosumab is dependent on body weight and estimated to be 0.290 L/day and 0.136 L/day in a typical 
adult (70 kg) and paediatric (30 kg) XLH patient, respectively, with corresponding disposition half-life 
(t1/2) in the serum ranging from approximately 16 to 19 days. Given the t1/2 estimates, the estimated time 
to reach the plateau of steady-state exposures is approximately 67 days. Following multiple dose 
administration to paediatric subjects, observed serum trough concentrations reach a plateau by 8 weeks 
after initiation of treatment.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Burosumab displays time-invariant pharmacokinetics that is linear to dose over the subcutaneous dose 
range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/kg. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
With the subcutaneous route of administration, in XLH and TIO subjects, a direct PK-PD relationship 
between serum burosumab concentrations and increases in serum phosphate concentration is observed 
and well described by an Emax/EC50 model. Serum burosumab and phosphate concentrations, as well as 
TmP/GFR, increased and decreased in parallel and reached maximum levels at approximately the same 
time point after each dose, supporting a direct PK-PD relationship. The AUC for the change from 
baseline in serum phosphate, TmP/GFR and 1,25(OH)2D increased linearly with increasing burosumab 
AUC. 
Paediatric PK/PD 
No significant difference has been observed in paediatric patient pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics as compared with PK/PD in the adult population. Burosumab clearance and volume 
of distribution are body weight dependent. 
Paediatric patients with TIO 
The starting dose of burosumab for paediatric patients with TIO is based on Population PK/PD 
modeling and simulations which indicate that a starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg every 2 weeks for children 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aged 1- 12 years and 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for adolescents aged 13-17 years is predicted to result in 
a proportion of paediatric patients with TIO reaching normal serum phosphate levels. These can be 
titrated up to a maximum of 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (the highest dose simulated). 
Special Populations 
Population PK analyses using data from paediatric and adult subjects who have XLH and adult subjects 
with TIO indicated that age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline serum albumin, baseline serum alkaline 
phosphate, baseline serum alanine aminotransferase, and baseline creatinine clearance ≥ 49.9 mL/min, 
were not significant predictors of burosumab PK. Based on the population PK analysis, the PK 
characteristics of burosumab were similar between XLH and TIO patients. 
Post-Prandial Effect on Serum Phosphate and Calcium  
The effect of burosumab on serum phosphate and calcium levels after food was investigated in two sub-
studies (Study UX023-CL301 and UX023-CL303); 13 paediatric patients (aged >3 years) and 26 adult 
patients (aged 24-65 years). Serum phosphate and calcium were measured at the end of the treatment 
interval in paediatric patients and mid-interval in adults. Blood samples were taken after a period of 
fasting, and again 1-2 hours after a standardised meal. 
Burosumab treatment did not cause post-prandial excursions above the age-adjusted upper limits of 
normal in serum phosphate or serum calcium in any paediatric or adult subject in the sub-studies. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions in non-clinical studies with normal animals were observed at exposures which 
resulted in serum phosphate concentration greater than normal limits. These effects were consistent with 
an exaggerated response to the inhibition of normal FGF23 levels resulting in a supraphysiologic 
increase in serum phosphate beyond the upper limit of normal. 
Studies in rabbits and adult and juvenile cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated dose-dependent elevations 
of serum phosphate and 1,25 (OH)2D confirming the pharmacologic actions of burosumab in these 
species. Ectopic mineralisation of multiple tissues and organs (e.g. kidney, heart, lung, and aorta), and 
associated secondary consequences (e.g. nephrocalcinosis) in some cases, due to hyperphosphataemia, 
was observed in normal animals at doses of burosumab that resulted in serum phosphate concentrations 
in animals greater than approximately 8 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). In a murine model of XLH, a significant 
reduction in the incidence of ectopic mineralisation was observed at equivalent levels of serum 
phosphate, suggesting that the risk of mineralisation is less in the presence of excess FGF23. 
Bone effects seen in adult and juvenile monkeys included changes in bone metabolism markers, 
increases in thickness and density of cortical bone, increased density of total bone and thickening of 
long bone. These changes were a consequence of higher than normal serum phosphate levels, which 
accelerated bone turnover and also led to periosteal hyperostosis and a decrease in bone strength in adult 
animals, but not in juvenile animals at the doses tested. Burosumab did not promote abnormal bone 
development, as no changes in femur length or bone strength were noted in juvenile animals. Bone 
changes were consistent with the pharmacology of burosumab and the role of phosphate in bone 
mineralization, metabolism and turnover. 
In repeat-dose toxicology studies of up to 40 weeks duration in cynomolgus monkeys, mineralisation of 
the rete testis/seminiferous tubules was observed in male monkeys; however, no changes were observed 
in semen analysis. No adverse effects on female reproductive organs were observed in these studies. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the reproductive and developmental toxicology study performed in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, 
moderate mineralisation of the placenta was seen in pregnant animals given 30 mg/kg of burosumab and 
occurred in animals with peak serum phosphate concentration greater than approximately 8 mg/dL (2.6 
mmol/L). Shortening of the gestation period and associated increased incidence of premature births 
were observed in pregnant monkeys at doses of ≥ 0.3 mg/kg which corresponded to burosumab 
exposures that are ≥0.875- to 1.39-fold anticipated clinical levels. Burosumab was detected in serum 
from fetuses indicating that burosumab was transported across the placenta to the fetus. There was no 
evidence of teratogenic effects. Ectopic mineralisation was not observed in foetuses or offspring and 
burosumab did not affect pre- and postnatal growth including survivability of the offspring. 
In preclinical studies, ectopic mineralisation has been observed in normal animals, most frequently in 
the kidney, given burosumab at doses that resulted in serum phosphate concentrations greater than 8 
mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). Neither new or clinically meaningful worsening of nephrocalcinosis nor ectopic 
mineralisation have been observed in clinical trials of patients with XLH treated with burosumab to 
achieve normal serum phosphate levels.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CRYSVITA is and what it is used for 
What CRYSVITA is 
CRYSVITA contains the active substance burosumab. This is a type of medicine called a human 
monoclonal antibody.  
What is CRYSVITA used for 
CRYSVITA is used to treat X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH). It is used in children and adolescents 
aged 1 to 17 years, and in adults. 
CRYSVITA is used to treat Tumour-induced Osteomalacia (TIO) where the tumour causing this 
condition cannot be successfully removed or found, in children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years and 
in adults.  
What is X-Linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH) 
X-Linked Hypophosphataemia (XLH) is a genetic disease. 
• 
• 
• 
People with XLH have higher levels of a hormone called fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). 
FGF23 lowers the amount of phosphate in the blood. 
The low level of phosphate may:  
- 
- 
lead to bones that may not harden properly and, in children and adolescents, cannot grow 
properly 
result in pain and stiffness in bones and joints 
What is Tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) 
• 
People with TIO have higher levels of a hormone called FGF23 produced by certain types of 
tumours. 
FGF23 lowers the amount of phosphate in the blood. 
The low level of phosphate may lead to softening of the bones, muscle weakness, tiredness, bone 
pain and fractures.  
• 
• 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How CRYSVITA works 
CRYSVITA attaches to FGF23 in the blood which stops FGF23 from working and increases the 
phosphate levels in the blood so that normal levels of phosphate can be achieved. 
2.  What you need to know before you use CRYSVITA  
Do not use CRYSVITA if 
• 
• 
you are allergic to burosumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)  
you are taking any phosphate supplements or certain vitamin D supplements (that contain so 
called active vitamin D, e.g. calcitriol) 
you already have a high level of phosphate in your blood (“hyper-phosphataemia”) 
you have severe kidney disease or kidney failure. 
• 
• 
Allergic reactions 
Stop taking CRYSVITA and contact your doctor straight away if you have any of the following side 
effects, as they could be signs of an allergic reaction: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rash and itching all over the body 
severe swelling of eyelids, mouth or lips (angio-oedema) 
shortness of breath 
rapid heartbeat 
sweating. 
Do not take CRYSVITA if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using CRYSVITA. 
Warnings and precautions  
Skin reactions 
You may get skin reactions where the injection is given, see section 4 for more information. If these 
reactions are severe, tell your doctor. 
Tests and checks 
Your doctor will check the phosphate and calcium levels in your blood and urine and may also do a 
renal ultrasound during your treatment in order to reduce the risk of hyperphosphataemia (too much 
phosphate in the blood) and ectopic mineralisation (a build-up of calcium in tissues such as the 
kidneys). Your serum parathyroid hormone level will also be checked from time to time. 
Children under 1 year 
CRYSVITA should not be given to children under 1 year of age because the safety and effects of the 
medicine have not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and CRYSVITA 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.  
Do not take CRYSVITA and tell your doctor if you are taking: 
• 
• 
phosphate supplements  
certain vitamin D supplements (that contain so called active vitamin D, e.g. calcitriol). There are 
some vitamin D supplements you can continue or start to use and your doctor will advise which 
ones these are.  
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor before taking CRYSVITA: 
• 
• 
if you are taking medicines that work in the same way as calcium in the body (“calcimimetics”). 
If used together they may lower blood calcium. 
if you are a patient with TIO and you are about to receive treatment of the underlying tumour (i.e. 
radiation therapy or surgical removal). In this case, treatment with CRYSVITA will not be started 
until after the treatment of the underlying tumour and if the serum phosphate levels are low.  
Pregnancy and breastfeeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. This is because it is not known if 
CRYSVITA will affect the baby. 
CRYSVITA is not recommended in pregnancy. 
If you could get pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception (birth control) while using 
CRYSVITA. You should discuss this with your doctor. 
It is not known if CRYSVITA passes into breast milk, and a risk to newborns or infants cannot be ruled 
out. You should discuss this with your doctor.  
Driving, riding a bike and using machines 
It is possible that CRYSVITA could cause dizziness and affect you being able to ride a bike, use any 
tools or machines or to drive. If you think you are affected, do not ride a bike, use any tools or machines 
or drive, and tell your doctor. 
CRYSVITA contains sorbitol  
This medicine contains 45.91 mg of sorbitol in each vial which is equivalent to 45.91 mg/ml.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
Read these Instructions for Use carefully before you use CRYSVITA: 
•  Only inject yourself or your child if you have been told to do so by your doctor.  
•  You should only inject after you have been trained in injection technique. The first self-injection 
after start of treatment or after any dose change should be carried out in front of a healthcare 
provider. 
•  Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse (healthcare provider) has 
told you. Check with your healthcare provider if you are not sure. 
•  Your doctor will prescribe your correct dose. Your dose is measured in milligrams (mg). 
CRYSVITA is available in three different strength vials: 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg. Each vial is 
for single use only. Always use a new CRYSVITA vial for each injection, see step 5 on how to 
dispose used vials and other supplies.

small needle to inject the liquid.  
o  Using the wrong syringe or needle can lead to a mistake in your dose or make the 
injection more painful. 
•  When giving CRYSVITA to a young child, it may be helpful to have another person present to 
provide support. 
•  Do not use CRYSVITA if allergic to any ingredients of this medicine. Stop using CRYSVITA if 
you have any allergic reaction during or after the injection and contact your healthcare provider 
straightaway. See section 2 of the package leaflet for more information. 
Step 1. Gather and Inspect Supplies 
Remove the CRYSVITA vials you need from the refrigerator.  
Check the strength on the label of each vial. 
Make sure that you have the correct number of vials to match the dose in mg as advised by your 
healthcare provider. 
If you are not sure, ask your healthcare provider for advice. 
Let the vials warm to room temperature for 30 minutes. Do not warm the vials in any other way, such as 
with hot water or a microwave oven. Do not put the vials in direct sunlight.  
Check the expiry date (shown after EXP) on the label of the vial. 
Inspect the liquid in the vial. Do not shake. 
Do not use the vial if it is: 
•  past the expiry date 
•  discoloured, cloudy or contains any particles. CRYSVITA liquid should be clear to slightly 
opalescent, colourless to pale brown-yellow.  
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Place all the items you will need on a clean, flat 
surface. For each injection you will need: 
A.  Vial of CRYSVITA for injection 
B.  One syringe with plunger  
C.  One large syringe needle to withdraw 
CRYSVITA 
D.  One small syringe needle to inject CRYSVITA  
E.  Alcohol wipes 
F.  Sharps container 
G.  Plaster (if required) 
H.  Gauze pad or cotton wool 
Contact your healthcare provider if you do not have 
these supplies. 
Your healthcare provider will explain the use of different needles. 
The large needle is used for withdrawing CRYSVITA from the vial.  
The small needle is used for injecting CRYSVITA.  
If you are not sure, ask your healthcare provider for advice before use. 
Do not use any items that have missing pieces or are damaged in any way. 
Do not remove the caps from the needles until you are ready to use them. 
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before going to Step 2.  
Step 2. Withdraw CRYSVITA and Prepare Injection 
Remove the sealing cap from the vial to reveal the rubber stopper. 
Clean the rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe and let it dry. Don’t touch the rubber stopper after 
cleaning it.  
Select the large needle and remove from the sterile 
packaging but do not remove the cap covering the 
needle. 
To attach the needle to the syringe, hold the large 
needle by the protective cap in one hand and the 
syringe by the barrel in the other hand.  
Depending on the supplies you have been given; 
•  you will need to push the needle down and turn 
clockwise onto the syringe until tight  
•  or push the needle down until it is firmly 
attached.  
Do not touch the needle itself or the end of the syringe 
where the needle attaches.  
Once the needle is firmly attached, hold the syringe by the barrel with the needle pointing up.  
Remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off.  
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not throw the needle cap away.  
Do not touch the needle or allow the needle to touch any surface once the cap has been removed.  
Do not use the syringe if you drop it after removing the cap or if the needle appears damaged. 
Your healthcare provider will tell you how much 
liquid you need to inject. This will normally be 1ml 
for each injection. Your healthcare provider will show 
you which mark to use if you need to inject less than 
1ml.  
Always use the mark equal to your dose. If you are 
not sure, ask your healthcare provider for advice 
before use. 
Pull back the syringe plunger until the end of the 
plunger lines up with mark equal to your dose. This 
fills the syringe with air.  
Keep the vial on a flat surface. 
Slowly insert the large needle through the rubber 
stopper and into the vial.  
Do not let the tip of the needle touch the liquid in the 
vial.  
If the tip of the needle touches the liquid, slowly pull 
the needle until it no longer touches the liquid.  
Slowly push the plunger into the syringe.  
This pushes air from the syringe into the vial.  
Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside 
down.  
Make sure the tip of the needle is at the bottom of the 
liquid.  
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Slowly pull back the plunger to fill the syringe until 
the end of the plunger lines up with the mark equal to 
your dose.  
Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid at all times. 
Check the liquid in the syringe for air bubbles.  
If you see bubbles, 
•  keep the syringe upright with the needle still inside 
the vial, 
•  gently tap the barrel with your finger to move the 
air bubbles,  
•  when the air bubbles are at the top, slowly push the 
plunger to push out the air bubbles. 
Check your dose again against the markings on the 
syringe.  
If required, withdraw some more liquid to line up with 
the mark equal to your dose.  
Check again for bubbles and repeat the process if 
required.  
When there are no bubbles in the syringe, pull the syringe and needle straight down out of the vial.  
Remove the large needle from the syringe. 
•  To do this, take the large needle cap and place on a 
flat surface. 
•  Using one hand, slide the large needle into the cap 
   and scoop upward to cover the needle without 
using your other hand to avoid injury. Then use 
your other hand to secure the cap and snap into 
place. 
•  Depending on your supplies, you will;  
o  need to twist the capped large needle anti-
clockwise to remove from the syringe  
o  or pull the capped large needle straight from 
the syringe and place in the sharps container. 
Select the small needle and remove from the sterile packaging but do not remove the cap covering the 
needle.  
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To attach the needle to the syringe, hold the small needle by the protective cap in one hand and the 
syringe by the barrel in the other hand.  
Depending on the supplies you have been given,  
•  you will need to push the needle down and turn clockwise onto the syringe until tight  
•  or push the needle down until it is firmly attached.  
Do not touch the needle itself or the end of the syringe where the needle attaches. 
Step 3. Prepare the Injection Site 
The injection must be given into the fatty layer just 
below the skin. You will need to choose an injection 
site. If you are giving the injection to yourself, 
suitable areas are: 
•  stomach area, upper thighs 
If you are giving the injection to someone else, 
suitable areas are: 
•  stomach area, upper thighs, outer area of upper 
arms, buttocks 
Do not inject: 
•  an area that is sore, red, bruised or where the skin 
is broken 
•  an area that has stretch marks or scars (including 
burns) 
•  directly into a mole, or an area around a mole 
If you are giving more than one injection, use a different site for each injection. Clean each injection site 
with a new alcohol wipe and leave the skin to dry. 
CRYSVITA should be injected into clean dry skin. 
Step 4. Inject CRYSVITA  
Remove the small needle cap by pulling it straight off.  
Pinch the skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, 
creating an area about 5 cm wide. 
Hold the syringe between the thumb and index finger 
of your dominant hand.  
The needle should be inserted into the skin at a 45° 
angle or 90° angle.  
Your healthcare provider will show you which angle 
you should use.  
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use a quick ‘dart-like’ motion to insert the needle into the pinched skin. 
Do not push the plunger when inserting the needle. 
When the needle is inserted do not move it around. 
Keep pinching the skin.  
Slowly push the plunger into the syringe, for up to 30 
seconds, until the syringe is empty. 
After you have given the full dose, remove the 
injection by gently pulling the syringe straight out.  
Release the pinched skin.  
Press the injection site with a cotton ball or gauze pad 
for a few seconds to stop bleeding. Apply a plaster if 
needed.  
Do not rub the injection site. 
To avoid any injury, do not put the cap back on the 
small needle. Place the uncapped needle in the sharps 
disposal container.

Step 5. After each injection  
Put your used needles, caps and syringes in the sharps disposal container, vials should be discarded 
according to your local guidelines.  
Do not throw away needles or syringes in your household waste.  
Do not save vials with leftover medicine for future use or pass it on to others.  
When your sharps container is almost full, you will need to follow your local guidelines to request 
another container and to dispose of it correctly. 
Reminder: If you are giving more than one injection, repeat steps 2-5 for each injection.  
Use new supplies for each injection. 
Note the date of the injection and all the areas where you have injected so that you use different sites for 
the next injection.  
A video showing you how to prepare and give the injection is available on the following link:

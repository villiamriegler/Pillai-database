For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection. 
Clear and colourless solution with pH of approximately 7.2. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Spinraza is indicated for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Spinraza should only be initiated by a physician with experience in the management of 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). 
The decision to treat should be based on an individualised expert evaluation of the expected benefits of 
treatment for that individual, balanced against the potential risk of treatment with Spinraza. Patients 
with profound hypotonia and respiratory failure at birth, where Spinraza has not been studied, may not 
experience a clinically meaningful benefit due to severe survival motor neuron (SMN) protein 
deficiency. 
Posology 
The recommended dosage is 12 mg (5 ml) per administration. 
Spinraza treatment should be initiated as early as possible after diagnosis with 4 loading doses on 
Days 0, 14, 28 and 63. A maintenance dose should be administered once every 4 months thereafter. 
Duration of treatment 
Information on long term efficacy of this medicinal product is not available. The need for continuation 
of therapy should be reviewed regularly and considered on an individual basis depending on the 
patient’s clinical presentation and response to the therapy. 
Missed or delayed doses 
If a loading or a maintenance dose is delayed or missed, Spinraza should be administered according to 
the schedule in Table 1 below.

Delayed or missed dose   
Loading dose 
•  Administer the delayed or missed loading dose as soon as possible with at least 14 days 
Timing of Dosing Administration 
between doses; continue with subsequent doses on the prescribed intervals from the last dose. 
e.g. if the third loading dose is administered 30 days late at Day 58 (instead of the original schedule 
at Day 28), then the fourth loading dose should be administered 35 days later at Day 93 (instead of 
the original schedule at Day 63) with a maintenance dose 4 months thereafter. 
Maintenance dose  
> 4 to < 8 months from last 
dose  
Timing of Dosing Administration  
•  Administer the delayed maintenance dose as soon as 
possible; then 
≥ 8 to < 16 months from 
last dose 
•  The next maintenance dose per the original scheduled date, as 
long as these two doses are administered at least 14 days apart*;  
•  Administer the missed dose as soon as possible and then the next 
dose 14 days later*;  
≥ 16 to < 40 months from 
last dose 
•  Administer the missed dose as soon as possible and then the next 
dose 14 days later, followed by a third dose 14 days later*; 
≥ 40 months from last dose   •  Administer the entire loading regimen on the prescribed intervals 
(Days 0, 14, 28 and 63)*;  
*then subsequently to the above recommendations, a maintenance dose 4 months after the last dose 
should be administered and repeated every 4 months.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Nusinersen has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The safety and efficacy in patients 
with renal impairment has not been established and they should be closely observed. 
Hepatic impairment 
Nusinersen has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Nusinersen is not metabolised 
via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver, therefore dose adjustment is unlikely to be 
required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Spinraza is for intrathecal use by lumbar puncture. 
Treatment should be administered by health care professionals experienced in performing lumbar 
punctures. 
Spinraza is administered as an intrathecal bolus injection over 1 to 3 minutes, using a spinal 
anaesthesia needle. The injection must not be administered in areas of the skin where there are signs of 
infection or inflammation. It is recommended that the volume of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), 
equivalent to the volume of Spinraza to be injected, is removed prior to administration of Spinraza. 
Sedation may be required to administer Spinraza, as indicated by the clinical condition of the patient. 
Ultrasound (or other imaging techniques) may be considered to guide intrathecal administration of 
Spinraza, particularly in younger patients and in patients with scoliosis; see instructions for use in 
section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Lumbar puncture procedure 
There is a risk of adverse reactions occurring as part of the lumbar puncture procedure (e.g. headache, 
back pain, vomiting; see section 4.8). Potential difficulties with this route of administration may be 
seen in very young patients and those with scoliosis. The use of ultrasound or other imaging 
techniques to assist with intrathecal administration of Spinraza, can be considered at the physician’s 
discretion. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities, including acute severe thrombocytopenia, have 
been observed after administration of other subcutaneously or intravenously administered antisense 
oligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, platelet and coagulation laboratory testing is recommended 
prior to administration of Spinraza. 
Renal toxicity 
Renal toxicity has been observed after administration of other subcutaneously and intravenously 
administered antisense oligonucleotides. If clinically indicated, urine protein testing (preferably using 
a first morning urine specimen) is recommended. For persistent elevated urinary protein, further 
evaluation should be considered. 
Hydrocephalus 
There have been reports of communicating hydrocephalus not related to meningitis or bleeding in 
patients treated with nusinersen in the post-marketing setting. Some patients were implanted with a 
ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. In patients with decreased consciousness, an evaluation for hydrocephalus 
should be considered. The benefits-and risks of nusinersen treatment in patients with a ventriculo-
peritoneal shunt are unknown at present and the maintenance of treatment needs to be carefully 
considered. 
Excipients  
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml vial, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
Potassium 
This medicinal product contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 5 ml vial, i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. In vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer 
or inhibitor of CYP450 mediated metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that the likelihood for 
interactions with nusinersen due to competition for plasma protein binding, or competition with or 
inhibition of transporters is low.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of nusinersen in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of nusinersen during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether nusinersen/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to the newborn/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from nusinersen therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
In toxicity studies in animals no effects on male or female fertility were observed (see section 5.3). 
There are no data available on the potential effects on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nusinersen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (ADRs) associated with the administration of Spinraza were 
headache, vomiting and back pain.  
The safety of Spinraza was assessed in clinical trials based on two Phase 3 clinical studies in infants 
(CS3B) and children (CS4) with SMA, together with one Phase 2 study in infants and children with 
SMA (CS7) and open-label studies including pre-symptomatic infants (CS5) genetically diagnosed 
with SMA and infants and children with SMA. Study CS11 enrolled infantile and later-onset patients 
including those who had completed studies CS3B, CS4 and CS12. Of the 352 patients who received 
Spinraza up to a maximum of 5 years, 271 patients received treatment for at least 1 year. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety assessment of Spinraza is based on data from patients from clinical trials and from post-
marketing surveillance. The ADRs associated with Spinraza administration are summarised in Table 2. 
The assessment of undesirable effects is based on the following frequency data: 
Very common (≥ 1/10)

*Adverse reactions considered related to the lumbar puncture procedure. These reactions can be considered manifestations of 
post-lumbar puncture syndrome. These adverse reactions were reported in CS4 (later onset SMA) with an incidence at least 
5% higher in patients treated with Spinraza (n=84) compared to Sham control. 
**e.g. angiodema, urticaria and rash. 
Events of communicating hydrocephalus have been observed in the post-marketing setting (see section 
4.4). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions associated with the administration of Spinraza by lumbar puncture have been 
observed. The majority of these are reported within 72 hours of the procedure. The incidence and 
severity of these events were consistent with events expected to occur with lumbar puncture. No 
serious complications of lumbar puncture, such as serious infections, have been observed in the 
clinical trials of Spinraza. 
Some adverse reactions commonly associated with lumbar puncture (e.g. headache and back pain) 
could not be assessed in the infant population exposed to Spinraza due to the limited communication 
appropriate for that age group. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenic response to nusinersen was determined in 346 patients with baseline and 
post-baseline plasma samples evaluated for anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Overall, the incidence of 
ADAs was low, with 15 (4%) patients classified as ADA positive overall, of which 4 had a transient 
response, 5 had a persistent response, and 6 patients had responses which could not be classified as 
transient or persistent at the time of data cut off. The impact of immunogenicity on safety was not 
formally analysed as the number of patients with ADAs was low. However, individual safety data for 
the treatment-emergent ADA-positive cases were reviewed, and no adverse events (AEs) of interest 
were identified. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via:

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: 
M09AX07 
Mechanism of action 
Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) which increases the proportion of exon 7 inclusion 
in survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts by binding to an 
intronic splice silencing site (ISS-N1) found in intron 7 of the SMN2 pre-messenger ribonucleic 
acid (pre-mRNA). By binding, the ASO displaces splicing factors, which normally suppress splicing. 
Displacement of these factors leads to retention of exon 7 in the SMN2 mRNA and hence when SMN2 
mRNA is produced, it can be translated into the functional full length SMN protein. 
SMA is a progressive neuromuscular disease resulting from mutations in chromosome 5q in the SMN1 
gene. A second gene SMN2, located near SMN1, is responsible for a small amount of SMN protein 
production. SMA is a clinical spectrum of disease with disease severity linked to fewer numbers of 
SMN2 gene copies and younger age of symptom onset. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Symptomatic patients 
Infantile onset 
Study CS3B (ENDEAR) was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study 
conducted in 121 symptomatic infants ≤ 7 months of age, diagnosed with SMA (symptom onset before 
6 months of age). CS3B was designed to assess the effect of Spinraza on motor function and survival. 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to either Spinraza (as per the approved dosing regimen) or sham-control, 
with a length of treatment ranging from 6 to 442 days. 
The median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of SMA was 6.5 weeks and 8 weeks for 
Spinraza treated versus sham-control patients respectively, with 99% of patients having 2 copies of the 
SMN2 gene and therefore deemed most likely to develop Type I SMA. The median age when patients 
received their first dose was 164.5 days for treated patients, and 205 days for sham-control. Baseline 
disease characteristics were largely similar in the Spinraza treated patients and sham-control patients 
except that Spinraza treated patients at baseline had a higher percentage compared to sham-control 
patients of paradoxical breathing (89% vs 66%), pneumonia or respiratory symptoms (35% vs 22%), 
swallowing or feeding difficulties (51% vs 29%) and requirement for respiratory support 
(26% vs 15%). 
At the final analysis, a statistically significant greater percentage of patients achieved the definition of 
a motor milestone responder in the Spinraza group (51%) compared to the sham-control 
group (0%) (p< 0.0001). Time to death or permanent ventilation (≥ 16 hours ventilation/day 
continuously for > 21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event or tracheostomy) was assessed 
as the primary endpoint. Statistically significant effects on event-free survival, overall survival, the 
proportion of patients achieving the definition of a motor milestone responder, and the percentage of 
patients with at least a 4-point improvement from baseline in Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia

Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disease (CHOP INTEND) score were observed in patients in the 
Spinraza group compared to those in the sham-control group (Table 3). 
In the efficacy set, 18 patients (25%) in the Spinraza group and 12 patients (32%) in the sham-control 
group required permanent ventilation. Of these patients, 6 (33%) in the Spinraza group and 0 (0%) in 
the sham-control group met the protocol-defined criteria for a motor-milestone responder.

Visit – Endear Study /CS3B (Efficacy Set, ES) 
To allow for long term follow up of these patients, at the end of Study CS3B, 89 patients 
(Spinraza: n=65; sham-control: n=24) enrolled in Study CS11 (SHINE). Study CS11 is an open label 
extension study for SMA patients who previously participated in the other Spinraza clinical studies. In 
Study CS11 all patients received Spinraza, with the length of treatment ranging from 65 to 592 days 
(median 289 days) at the time of interim analysis. Improvements in motor function were observed 
among patients continuing Spinraza from Study CS3B, as well as those who initiated Spinraza in 
Study CS11 (Figure 3), with the greatest benefit observed in those with earlier treatment initiation. 
Among patients without permanent ventilation at the baseline of Study CS11, a majority were alive 
and without permanent ventilation at the time of interim analysis. 
In patients randomized to Spinraza in Study CS3B and including the experience in Study CS11, the 
median time to death or permanent ventilation was 73 weeks. At the time of a Study CS11 interim 
analysis, 61 out of 65 patients (94%) were alive. Of the 45 patients who had not met the definition of 
permanent ventilation in Study CS3B, 38 patients (84%) were alive without permanent ventilation in 
Study CS11 at the time of interim analysis. Further improvement in mean total motor milestone 
(HINE-Section 2) (2.1; SD 4.36; n=22) and CHOP INTEND (4.68; SD 3.993, n=22) scores were 
observed from baseline to Study Day 304 in Study CS11. 
Patients who first initiated Spinraza treatment in Study CS11 (n=24; sham control in Study CS3B) 
were of a median age of 17.8 months (range 10 - 23 months) and had a mean CHOP INTEND score of 
17.25 (range 2.0 - 46.0) at baseline in Study CS11. At the time of interim analysis, 22 out of 24 
patients (92%) were alive. Of the twelve patients (50%) who had not met the definition of permanent 
ventilation in Study CS3B, 7 patients (58%) were alive without permanent ventilation in Study CS11. 
The median time to death or permanent ventilation was 50.9 weeks after initiation of Spinraza 
treatment in Study CS11. Improvement in mean total motor milestone (HINE-Section 2) (1.2; SD 1.8; 
n=12) and CHOP INTEND (3.58; SD 7.051, n=12) scores were observed from baseline to Study Day 
304 in Study CS11. 
These results are supported by an open-label Phase 2 study in symptomatic patients diagnosed with 
SMA (CS3A). Median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms was 56 days and patients had either 
2 SMN2 gene copies (n=17) or 3 SMN2 gene copies (n=2) (SMN2 gene copy number unknown for 
1 patient). Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type I SMA. The median age at 
first dose was 162 days. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved in one or more categories in motor 
milestones (according to HINE section 2: ≥2 point increase [or maximal score] in ability to kick or 
voluntary grasp OR ≥1 point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, 
crawling, standing or walking). Twelve out of 20 patients (60%) in the study met the primary endpoint 
with improvement in mean motor milestone achievement over time. An improvement in mean CHOP 
INTEND score over time was observed from baseline to day 1072 (mean change 21.30). Overall, 11 
out of 20 patients (55%) met the endpoint of an increase in total CHOP INTEND score of ≥4 points as 
of the last study visit. Of the 20 subjects enrolled, 11 (55%) were alive and free of permanent 
ventilation at the last visit. Four patients met the criteria for permanent ventilation and five patients 
died during the study. 
Later onset 
Study CS4 (CHERISH) was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study 
conducted in 126 symptomatic patients with later-onset SMA (symptom onset after 6 months of age). 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to either Spinraza (dosed with 3 loading doses and maintenance doses 
every 6 months) or sham-control, with a length of treatment ranging from 324 to 482 days. The 
median age at screening was 3 years, and the median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of 
SMA was 11 months. The majority of patients (88%) have 3 copies of the SMN2 gene (8% have 
2 copies, 2% have 4 copies, and 2% have an unknown copy number). At baseline, patients had a mean 
Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) score of 21.6, a mean revised upper limb 
module (RULM) of 19.1, all had achieved independent sitting, and no patients had achieved 
independent walking. Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type II or III SMA. 
Baseline disease characteristics were generally similar with the exception of an imbalance in the 
proportion of patients who had ever achieved the ability to stand without support (13% of patients in 
the Spinraza group and 29% in sham-control) or walk with support (24% of patients in the Spinraza 
group and 33% in sham-control). 
At the final analysis, a statistically significant improvement in HFMSE score from baseline to 
Month 15 was seen in the Spinraza group compared to the sham-control group (Table 4 , Figure 2). 
The analysis was conducted in the ITT population (Spinraza: n=84; sham-control: n=42), and 
post-baseline HFMSE data for patients without a Month 15 visit were imputed using the multiple 
imputation method. An analysis of the subset of patients in the ITT population who had observed 
values at Month 15 demonstrated consistent, statistically significant results. Of those with observed 
values at Month 15, a higher proportion of Spinraza treated subjects had improvement (73% vs 41%, 
respectively) and a lower proportion of Spinraza treated subjects had worsening (23% vs 44%, 
respectively) in total HFMSE score compared to sham-control. Secondary endpoints including 
functional measures and WHO motor milestone achievement were formally statistically tested and are 
described in Table  4. 
Initiation of treatment sooner after symptom onset resulted in earlier and greater improvement in 
motor function than those with delayed treatment initiation; however, both groups experienced benefit 
compared to sham-control.

Upon completion of Study CS4 (CHERISH) 125 patients enrolled in Study CS11 (SHINE), where all 
patients received Spinraza. The length of treatment ranged from 74 to 474 days (median 250 days) at 
the time of the interim analysis. A majority of Spinraza treated patients experienced stabilization or 
improvement in motor function, with the greatest benefit observed in those with earlier treatment 
initiation.

Of patients who initiated Spinraza treatment in Study CS4 (n=39), stabilization or additional 
improvements in mean HFMSE (0.2; SD 3.06) and RULM (0.7; SD 2.69) scores were observed from 
baseline to Study Day 265 in Study CS11. 
Patients who initiated Spinraza treatment in Study CS11 (n=20) had a median age of 4.0 years (range 
3 - 8 years). Of these patients, stabilization or improvement in mean HFMSE (1.4; SD 4.02) and 
RULM (2.1; SD 2.56) scores were observed from baseline to Study Day 265 in Study CS11. 
These results are supported by 2 open label studies (study CS2 and study CS12). The analysis included 
28 patients who received their first dose in study CS2, and then transferred to the extension phase, 
study CS12. The studies enrolled patients who were between 2 to 15 years of age at first dose. Of the 
28 patients, 3 were at least 18 years of age at their last study visit. 1 out of 28 patients had 2 SMN2 
gene copies, 21 had 3 copies, and 6 had 4 copies. 
Patients were assessed over a 3 year treatment period. A sustained improvement was seen in patients 
with Type II SMA who experienced a mean improvement from baseline HFMSE score of 5.1 
(SD 4.05, n=11) at Day 253, and 9.1(SD 6.61, n=9) at Day 1050. The mean total score was 26.4 
(SD 11.91) at Day 253 and 31.3 (SD 13.02) at Day 1050, no plateau was observed. Patients with 
Type III SMA demonstrated a mean improvement from baseline HFMSE score of 1.3 (SD 1.87, n=16) 
at Day 253 and 1.2 (SD 4.64, n=11) at Day 1050. The mean total score was 49.8 (SD 12.46) at 
Day 253 and 52.6 (SD 12.78) at 1050 days. 
In patients with Type II SMA the Upper Limb Module test was conducted with mean improvement of 
1.9 (SD 2.68, n=11) at Day 253 and 3.5 (SD 3.32, n=9) at Day 1050. The mean total score was13.8 
(SD 3.09) at Day 253 and 15.7 (SD 1.92) at Day 1050. 
The 6MWT (six-minute walk test) was conducted for ambulatory patients only. In these patients, a 
mean improvement of 28.6 meters (SD 47.22, n=12) at Day 253 and 86.5 metres (SD 40.58, n=8) at 
Day 1050. The mean 6MWT distance was 278.5 meters (SD 206.46) at Day 253 and 333.6 metres 
(SD 176.47) at Day 1050. Two previously non-independent ambulatory patients (Type III) achieved 
independent walking, and one non-ambulatory patient (Type II) achieved independent walking. 
An additional clinical study, CS7 (EMBRACE) was opened for patients not eligible for participation 
in Study CS3B or Study CS4 due to screening age or SMN2 copy number. CS7 is a phase 2, 
randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure study in symptomatic patients diagnosed with infantile-
onset SMA (≤6 months) or later-onset SMA (>6 months) and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 (Part 1), 
followed by a long-term open label extension phase (Part 2). In Part 1 of the study, patients were 
followed for a median of 302 days. 
All patients who received Spinraza were alive as of the early termination of Part 1, however, one 
patient in the control arm died at Study Day 289. In addition, no patients in the Spinraza or sham-
control group required the use of permanent ventilation. Of the 13 patients with infantile-onset SMA, 
7 of out 9 patients (78%; 95%CI: 45, 94) in the Spinraza group and 0 out of 4 patients (0%; 95%CI: 0, 
60) in the sham group met the criteria for motor milestone response (according to HINE section 2: ≥2 
point increase [or maximal score] in ability to kick OR ≥1 point increase in the motor milestones of 
head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing or walking and improvement in more categories of 
motor milestones than worsening). Of the 8 patients with later-onset SMA, 4 out of 5 patients (80%; 
95% CI: 38, 96) in the Spinraza group and 2 out of 3 (67%; 95% CI: 21, 94) in the sham-control group 
met this definition of response. 
Adult  
Real world clinical findings support the effectiveness of nusinersen to stabilize or improve motor 
function in some SMA adult Type II and III patients.  
By month 14 of nusinersen treatment, the number of patients with a clinically meaningful 
improvement from baseline on HFMSE (≥ 3 points) was 53 out of 129 patients, the number of patients 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with clinically meaningful improvement on the RULM (≥ 2 points) was 28 out of 70 and among 
walkers 25 out of 49 for the 6MWT (≥ 30 meters). 
The safety data in the adult population are consistent with the known safety profile of nusinersen and 
with co-morbidities associated with the underlying disease of SMA. 
Pre-symptomatic infants 
Study CS5 (NURTURE) is an open-label study in pre-symptomatic infants genetically diagnosed with 
SMA, who were enrolled at 6 weeks of age or younger. Patients in this study were deemed most likely 
to develop Type I or II SMA. Median age at first dose was 22 days. 
An interim analysis was conducted when patients had been on study for median of 27.1 months (15.1 -
35.5 months) and were of a median age at last visit of 26.0 months (14.0 -34.3 months). At the interim 
analysis, all 25 patients (2 SMN2 gene copies, n=15; 3 SMN2 gene copies, n=10) were alive without 
permanent ventilation. The primary endpoint, time to death or respiratory intervention (defined as 
invasive or non-invasive ventilation for ≥6 hours/day continuously for ≥7 consecutive days OR 
tracheostomy), could not be estimated as there were too few events. Four patients (2 SMN2 copies) 
required respiratory intervention >6 hours/day continuously for ≥7 days, all of whom initiated 
ventilatory support during an acute reversible illness 
Patients achieved milestones unexpected in Type I or II SMA and more consistent with normal 
development. At the interim analysis, all 25 (100%) patients had achieved the WHO motor milestone 
of sitting without support, 22 (88%) patients were walking with assistance. Among patients older than 
the WHO defined window for expected age of achievement (95th percentile), 17 of 22 (77%) had 
achieved walking alone. The mean CHOP INTEND score at last assessment was 61.0 (46 - 64) 
amongst patients with 2 SMN2 copies and 62.6 (58 - 64) amongst those with 3 SMN2 copies. All 
patients had the ability to suck and swallow at last assessment, with 22 (88%) infants achieving a 
maximal score on the HINE Section 1. 
The proportion of patients developing clinically manifested SMA was assessed amongst patients who 
reached the Day 700 visit at the interim analysis (n=16). The protocol-defined criteria for clinically 
manifested SMA included age-adjusted weight below the fifth WHO percentile, a decrease of 2 or 
more major weight growth curve percentiles, the placement of a percutaneous gastric tube, and/or the 
inability to achieve expected age-appropriate WHO milestones (sitting without support, standing with 
assistance, hands-and-knees crawling, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone). At 
day 700, 7 out of 11 patients (64%) with 2 SMN2 gene copies and 0 out of 5 patients (0%) with 3 
SMN2 copies, met the protocol-defined criteria of clinically manifested SMA, however, these patients 
were gaining weight and achieving WHO milestones, inconsistent with Type I SMA. A comparison of 
motor milestone achievement among the patients with symptomatic infantile-onset SMA and 
pre-symptomatic SMA is shown in Figure 3.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nusinersen, administered via intrathecal injection, 
were determined in paediatric patients diagnosed with SMA. 
Absorption 
Intrathecal injection of nusinersen into the CSF allows nusinersen to be fully available for distribution 
from the CSF to the target central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Mean CSF trough concentrations of 
nusinersen accumulated approximately 1.4- to 3-fold after multiple loading and maintenance doses, 
and reached a steady state within approximately 24 months. Following intrathecal administration 
trough plasma concentrations of nusinersen were relatively low compared to the trough CSF 
concentration. Median plasma Tmax values ranged from 1.7 to 6.0 hours. Mean plasma Cmax and AUC 
values increased approximately dose proportionally over the evaluated dose range. There is no 
accumulation in plasma exposure measures (Cmax and AUC) after multiple doses. 
Distribution 
Autopsy data from patients (n=3) show that nusinersen administered intrathecally is broadly 
distributed within the CNS achieving therapeutic levels in the target spinal cord tissues. Presence of 
nusinersen was also demonstrated in neurons and other cell types in the spinal cord and brain, and 
peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney. 
Biotransformation 
Nusinersen is metabolized slowly and predominantly via exonuclease (3’- and 5’) -mediated 
hydrolysis and is not a substrate for, or inhibitor or inducer of CYP450 enzymes. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
The mean terminal elimination half-life in CSF is estimated at 135 to 177 days. The primary route of 
elimination is expected via urinary excretion of nusinersen and its metabolites. 
Interactions 
In vitro studies indicated that nusinersen is not an inducer or inhibitor of CYP450-mediated oxidative 
metabolism and therefore should not interfere with other medicinal products for these metabolic 
pathways. Nusinersen is not a substrate or inhibitor of human BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, 
OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP transporters. 
Characteristics in specific patient populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of nusinersen in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been studied. 
The effect of hepatic or renal insufficiency as covariates could not be thoroughly evaluated in the 
population PK model given the rarity of patients displaying clinically relevant liver or kidney 
insufficiencies. Population PK analyses revealed no apparent correlation between hepatic and renal 
clinical chemistry markers and inter-subject variability. 
Race 
The majority of patients studied were Caucasian. The population PK analysis suggests that race is 
unlikely to affect the PK of nusinersen. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Genotoxicity/Carcinogenity 
Nusinersen demonstrated no evidence of genotoxicity. Nusinersen was not carcinogenic in a 2-year 
study in mice at plasma exposure levels 104-fold higher than in patients receiving 12 mg of 
maintenance nusinersen. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive toxicology studies were conducted using subcutaneous administration of nusinersen in 
mice and rabbits. No impact on male or female fertility, or embryo-foetal development, or 
pre/post-natal development was observed. 
Toxicology 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies (14-weeks and 53-weeks) of intrathecal administration to juvenile 
cynomolgus monkeys, nusinersen was well tolerated. The exception was an acute, transient deficit in 
lower spinal reflexes which occurred at the highest dose levels in each study (3 or 4 mg per dose; 
equivalent to 30 or 40 mg per intrathecal dose in patients). These effects were observed within several 
hours post-dose and generally resolved within 48 hours. 
In the 53-week intrathecal dosing study in cynomolgus monkeys no toxicity effects were seen at levels 
up to 14-fold the recommended annual clinical maintenance dose.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Spinraza is and what it is used for 
Spinraza contains the active substance nusinersen which belongs to a group of medicines known as 
antisense oligonucleotides. Spinraza is used to treat a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA). 
Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a shortage of a protein called survival motor neuron (SMN) in 
the body. This results in the loss of nerve cells in the spine, leading to weakness of the muscles in the 
shoulders, hips, thighs and upper back. It may also weaken the muscles used for breathing and 
swallowing. 
Spinraza works by helping the body to produce more of the SMN protein that people with SMA are 
lacking. This reduces the loss of nerve cells and so may improve muscle strength. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child are given Spinraza 
Spinraza must not be given 
• 
If you or your child are allergic to nusinersen or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Spinraza. 
Warnings and precautions 
There is a risk of side effects occuring after Spinraza is given by a lumbar puncture procedure (see 
section 3). This can include headaches, vomiting and back pain. There may also be difficulties with 
giving a medicine by this method in very young patients and those with scoliosis (twisted and curved 
spine). 
Other products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the cells 
in the blood which help clotting. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide 
to do a blood test to check that your or your child’s blood can clot properly. This may not be required 
every time you or your child are given Spinraza. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other products that are in the same group of medicines as Spinraza have been shown to affect the 
kidneys. Before you or your child are given Spinraza your doctor may decide to do a urine test to 
check that your or your child’s kidneys are working normally. This may not be required every time 
you or your child are given Spinraza. 
There have been a small number of reports of patients developing hydrocephalus (a build-up of too 
much fluid around the brain) after Spinraza is given. Some of these patients had needed to have a 
device called a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt implanted to treat the hydrocephalus. If you notice any 
symptoms of increase in head size, decreased consciousness, persistent nausea, vomiting or headache; 
or other symptoms that cause you concern, please inform your or your child’s doctor to seek necessary 
treatment. The benefits and risks of continuing Spinraza whilst having a "ventriculo-peritoneal shunt" 
in place are not known at present. 
Talk to your doctor before you or your child are given Spinraza. 
Other medicines and Spinraza 
Tell your doctor if you or your child are taking, have recently taken any, or might take any other 
medicines in future. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. It is preferable to avoid the use of Spinraza 
during pregnancy and breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Spinraza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Spinraza contains a small amount of sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 ml vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’ and can be used by people on a sodium-restricted diet. 
Spinraza contains a small amount of potassium 
This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 5 ml vial, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-
free’. 
3. 
How Spinraza is given 
The usual dose of Spinraza is 12 mg. 
Spinraza is given; 
• 
• 
• 
On the first day of treatment, day 0 
Then around day 14, day 28 and day 63 
Then once every 4 months. 
Spinraza is given by injection into the lower back. This injection, called a lumbar puncture, is done by 
inserting a needle into the space around the spinal cord. This will be done by a doctor experienced in 
doing lumbar punctures. You or your child may also be given a medicine to make you relax or sleep 
during the procedure. 
How long to use Spinraza 
Your doctor will tell you how long you or your child need to receive Spinraza. Don’t stop treatment 
with Spinraza unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you or your child misses an injection 
If you or your child miss a dose of Spinraza, speak with your doctor so that Spinraza can be given as 
soon as possible. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have any questions about how Spinraza is given, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Side effects related to the lumbar puncture may occur while Spinraza is being given or afterwards. The 
majority of these side effects are reported within 72 hours of the procedure. 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)

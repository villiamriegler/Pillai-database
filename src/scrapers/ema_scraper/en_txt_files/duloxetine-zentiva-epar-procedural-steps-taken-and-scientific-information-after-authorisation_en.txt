SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Duloxetine Zentiva in the approved indication remains 
favourable and therefore recommended the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation with unlimited validity.

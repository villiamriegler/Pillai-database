PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  
 
1.
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ABECMA
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Abecma. The RMP details important 
risks of Abecma, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Abecma’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Abecma’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the associated package leaflet (PL) 
give essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how Abecma 
should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Abecma should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Abecma’s 
RMP. 
The Medicine and what it is Used for 
1.1. 
Abecma is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least three prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. It contains idecabtagene vicleucel as the 
active substance and it is given by infusion.  
Further information about the evaluation of Abecma’s benefits can be found in the Abecma’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency 
website: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/abecma. 
1.2. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of Abecma, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Abecma’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Abecma, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Abecma is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
1.3. 
Important risks of Abecma are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Abecma. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine). 
Important identified and potential risks, together with missing information, are summarised in 
Table 1.

Risk factors and 
risk groups 
In the pooled analysis from MM-001 and CRB-401 clinical studies, 149 (81.0%) subjects 
who received Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells had 
≥ 1 CRS event. CRS has likewise been reported with CD19 directed CAR T providing 
further evidence of a class risk. 
Macrophage activation syndrome (PT of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) was 
reported for 4 (2.2%) subjects in the pooled analysis: 1 (1.4%) subject who received 
Abecma at a target dose of 300 × 106 CAR+ T cells and 3 (3.3%) subjects who received 
Abecma at a target dose of 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells. Macrophage activation syndrome was 
reported in 2 (1.1%) subjects at a maximum severity of Grade 2 and in 2 (1.1%) subjects at 
a maximum severity of Grade 4. Grade 4 MAS AEs reported for the 2 subjects were 
ongoing at the time of their deaths. 
CRS is considered an important identified risk due to its frequency and the potential for 
serious outcomes, including death, if untreated. Thus, further evaluation of frequency, 
severity, seriousness and outcome of this risk in the postmarketing period is warranted. 
Macrophage activation syndrome and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are 
potentially life-threatening. Cytokine release syndrome has been reported in a few cases to 
be associated with findings of MAS/HLH, and the physiology of the syndromes may 
overlap. 
In the pooled analysis for the MM-001 and CRB-001 clinical studies, 149 (81.0%) subjects 
who received Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells had 
≥ 1 CRS event. The frequency of subjects with CRS increased with target dose: 40.9%, 
75.7%, and 94.6% of subjects who received Abecma at a target dose of 150, 300, and 
450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, respectively.  
An exploratory analysis of baseline predictors for CRS in Study MM-001 showed no 
correlation of pre-infusion immune-related soluble factors, or clinical markers of 
inflammation (C-reactive protein or ferritin) with any grade CRS, CRS requiring 
tocilizumab, or CRS requiring steroids. However, elevated serum BCMA concentration 
pre-infusion was associated with CRS requiring corticosteroids.  
Macrophage activation syndrome is usually associated with more severe forms of CRS.

Neurologic Toxicity 
Important Identified Risk: Neurologic Toxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Neurologic toxicity is considered an important identified risk due to its seriousness and its 
potential for associated disability, including death, if left untreated. In addition to CRS, 
neurologic toxicity is an expected acute AE associated with CAR T cell therapy. The 
diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms in the absence of definitive diagnostic 
tests. Neurologic toxicity is primarily managed with supportive care for low grade toxicity, 
and corticosteroids are frequently used for more severe neurologic toxicity. 
In order to enable a side-by-side comparison and pooling of data across Studies MM-001 
and CRB-401, a Neurologic Toxicity-Focused AEs search approach was required that 
included selected PTs of neurologic toxicity events as determined by the Applicant with 
consideration of biological/pharmacological plausibility for a drug-event relationship, 
known neurologic toxicities reported with this class of drug and consistent with published 
guidelines for CAR T cell-associated encephalopathy, and clinical judgement.  
In the pooled analysis, 77 (41.8%) subjects who received Abecma across the target dose 
levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells had ≥ 1 Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AE on or 
after Abecma infusion. Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AEs reported for ≥ 5% of subjects 
were confusional state (13.0%), insomnia (9.8%), tremor (8.2%), and somnolence (6.5%). 
The frequencies of Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AEs were similar for subjects who 
received Abecma at a target dose of 300 and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells (42.9% and 44.6%, 
respectively) and higher than for those who received Abecma at a target dose of 
150 × 106 CAR+ T cells (27.3%). 
In the pooled analysis, the frequencies of Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AEs were similar 
for subjects who received Abecma at a target dose of 300 and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells 
(42.9% and 44.6%, respectively) and higher than for those who received Abecma at a 
target dose of 150 × 106 CAR+ T cells (27.3%). Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AEs were 
reported for 33.6% of subjects in Study MM-001 within the first 8 weeks and for 9.8% of 
subjects > 8 weeks after Abecma infusion. 
In Study MM-001, there was no correlation of pre-infusion soluble biomarkers with 
investigator-identified neurotoxicity events, and no association of serum BCMA levels 
with any grade investigator-identified neurotoxicity events.

Cytopenias 
Important Identified Risk: Cytopenias 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence: 
The AE category of Cytopenia – Overall and sub-category names refer to not only the 
individual PT, but also includes AE PTs relating to the defined medical condition/concept 
of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia. 
In Study MM-001, 124 (96.9%) subjects who received Abecma across the target dose 
levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells had ≥ 1 Cytopenia – Overall AE. The 3 most 
commonly reported events were neutropenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
Cytopenias (eg, neutropenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia) were among the most 
frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs in the Abecma treated population in Study MM-001, 
and most of these events were reported within the first 8 weeks after Abecma infusion. 
Across the target dose levels, the reports of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia were predominantly Grade 4, while the reports of anaemia were 
primarily Grade 3. As anaemia was considered less severe and more manageable 
compared with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, this section focuses on neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia. 
In Study MM-001, Cytopenia – Neutropenia AEs were reported for 94.5% of subjects 
who received Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells. At 
the target doses of 150, 300, and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, Cytopenia – Neutropenia AEs 
were reported for 100%, 94.3%, and 94.4% of subjects, respectively. Cytopenia – 
Neutropenia AEs were reported for 93.8% of subjects within the first 8 weeks and for 
38.5% of subjects > 8 weeks after Abecma infusion. 
Almost all subjects (93.0%) had ≥ 1 Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia – Neutropenia AE. No subject 
had a Grade 5 Cytopenia – Neutropenia AE. At the target doses of 150, 300, and 
450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia – Neutropenia AEs were reported for 
100%, 91.4%, and 94.4% of subjects, respectively. The frequency of subjects with Grade 3 
or 4 Cytopenia – Neutropenia AEs was 92.2% within the first 8 weeks and 23.0% > 8 
weeks after Abecma infusion. 
Most (87.5%) subjects received colony-stimulating factors (eg, filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim) during the study. 
In Study MM-001, Cytopenia – Thrombocytopenia AEs were reported for 65.6% of 
subjects who received Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T 
cells. At the target doses of 150, 300, and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, frequency of Cytopenia 
– Thrombocytopenia AEs did not increase with increased target dose (100%, 64.3%, and 
64.8%, respectively). Cytopenia – Thrombocytopenia AEs were reported for 61.7% of 
subjects within the first 8 weeks and for 32.8% of subjects > 8 weeks after Abecma 
infusion. 
Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia – Thrombocytopenia AEs were reported for 53.9% of subjects, 
with Grade 4 events reported for 45.3% of subjects. No subject had a Grade 5 Cytopenia 
– Thrombocytopenia AE. At the target doses of 150, 300, and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 
Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia – Thrombocytopenia AEs were reported for 75.0%, 51.4%, and 
55.6% of subjects, respectively. The frequency of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia 
– Thrombocytopenia AEs was 51.6% within the first 8 weeks and 22.1% > 8 weeks after 
Abecma infusion. 
Approximately half (49.2%; 63/128) of all subjects received platelet transfusions during 
the study, and the median number of transfusions among subjects who received it was 6 
(range: 1 to 40). Thrombopoietin mimetics were also received by 3.1% of subjects during 
the study.

Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Analyses of time to recovery of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia presented in this 
section are based on laboratory values rather than cytopenia reported by investigators on 
the AE CRF. Time to Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia (neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) recovery 
after Abecma infusion was evaluated for subjects with last laboratory assessment within 
Month 1 indicating Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia (ie, subjects with persistent Grade 3 or 4 
cytopenia). Recovery from cytopenia was defined as returning to ≤ Grade 2 severity after 
Month 1.  
In Study MM-001, across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 
125 (97.7%) of 128 subjects had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia within Month 1 of the Abecma 
infusion date. Of these 125 subjects, 52 (41.6%) had not recovered at Month 1 
(ie, persistent neutropenia). For 43 (82.7%) of these 52 subjects, their Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia recovered to Grade 0 to 2 after Month 1; the median time to recovery in these 
subjects was 1.9 months (range: 1.2 to 5.6). For 9 (17.3%) of the 52 subjects, their 
persistent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia did not recover (1 subject at 150 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 
3 subjects at 300 × 106 CAR+ T cells, and 5 subjects at 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells); the 
reasons that the Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia did not recover were death (7 subjects) and lost 
to follow-up (2 subjects). No subject had ongoing persistent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia as of 
the data cutoff date. 
Across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 83 (64.8%) of 
128 subjects had Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia within Month 1 of the Abecma infusion 
date. Of these 83 subjects, 62 (74.7%) had not recovered at Month 1 (ie, persistent 
thrombocytopenia). For 43 (69.4%) of the 62 subjects, their persistent Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia recovered to Grade 0 to 2 after Month 1; the median time to recovery in 
these subjects was 2.1 months (range: 1.2 to 13.8). For 19 (30.6%) of the 62 subjects, their 
persistent Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia did not recover (2 subjects at 150 × 106 CAR+ T 
cells, 9 subjects at 300 × 106 CAR+ T cells, and 8 subjects at 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells); the 
reasons that the Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia did not recover were death (13 subjects) 
and lost to follow-up (4 subjects); 2 (10.5%) subjects had ongoing persistent Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia as of the data cutoff date. 
Cytopenias are common in both advanced MM patients and in patients treated with CAR T 
therapy. Contributing factors in RRMM patients include progressive myeloma, prior 
AMTs, concomitant medications, LDC, and post-infusion toxicities, such as CRS and 
infection. At the target doses of 150, 300, and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, Grade 3 or 4 
Cytopenia – Overall AEs were reported for 95.5%, 95.7%, and 94.6% of subjects, 
respectively. The frequency of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia – Overall was 95.1% 
within the first 8 weeks and 41.5% > 8 weeks after infusion.

Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
Important Identified Risk: Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia is considered an important identified risk due to the expected 
off-tumour, on-target toxicity of plasma cell aplasia from Abecma which may result in 
some degree of hypogammaglobulinaemia and associated immunosuppression. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia is a known risk factor for development of infections in MM 
patients. The expected duration of plasma cell aplasia is unknown, but may persist much 
longer than Abecma CAR+ T cells remain in the body. Prolonged plasma cell aplasia is 
expected to result in hypogammaglobulinaemia which can also be observed as a 
manifestation of myeloma itself. Hypogammaglobulinaemia may increase the risk of 
bacterial and other infections including opportunistic infections and viral reactivation. 
Intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement may be needed to maintain adequate IgG 
levels. The use of prophylactic antibiotics may also be necessary. 
In the pooled analyses, hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 21.2% of subjects 
treated with Abecma. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
The destruction of non-tumour BCMA+ plasma cells in healthy tissues, or “on-target/ 
off-tumour” toxicity, may result in some degree of hypogammaglobulinaemia and 
associated immunosuppression. Therefore, the mechanism of action (MOA) for Abecma 
may play a role in subjects developing hypogammaglobulinaemia.

Infections 
Important Identified Risk: Infections 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Infections are a major cause of morbidity in patients with MM with approximately 25% of 
patients presenting with recurrent infections and serious infections reported for > 75% of 
patients.  
In the pooled analysis, 131 (71.2%) subjects who received Abecma across the target dose 
levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells had Infections – Overall. The most frequently 
(≥ 5% of subjects) reported PTs were upper respiratory tract infection (21.7%), pneumonia 
(10.3%), urinary tract infection (8.7%), influenza (7.1%), and sinusitis (6.0%). Overall, the 
frequency of Infections was similar at the target doses of 150, 300, and 450 × 106 CAR+ T 
cells (72.7%, 67.1%, and 73.9%, respectively). Grade 3 or 4 Infections were reported for 
23.4% of subjects, with 18.5% of subjects experiencing Grade 3 events. 
Infections represent an identified risk of treatment with Abecma and may include bacterial, 
fungal, pneumocystis, viral reactivation and symptomatic viral infections (eg, 
cytomegalovirus, HBV, respiratory viruses and other viruses). Risk factors for infection 
include immune dysfunction from myeloma, LDC (ie, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) 
associated lymphopenia and myelosuppression, and Abecma treatment-associated

toxicities. Cytokine release syndrome may exacerbate and delay recovery from cytopenias, 
and treatment of CRS and neurotoxicity with corticosteroids may also increase infection 
risk. 
Plasma cell aplasia following Abecma treatment is an expected on-target toxicity of 
BCMA-targeted CAR T cell therapies and may result in chronic 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. Infections including life-threatening and fatal have been 
reported after Abecma including bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pneumonia 
cytomegaloviral, pneumonia, fungal infection, and mucormycosis. 
Risk factors for the development of infection include immunocompromised state resulting 
from neutropenia, lymphopenia, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs, and 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. Cytokine release syndrome may exacerbate and delay recovery 
from cytopenias, and treatment of CRS and neurotoxicity with corticosteroids may 
increase infection risk. Finally, plasma cell aplasia following Abecma treatment is an 
expected on-target toxicity of BCMA targeted CAR T cell therapies and may result in 
chronic hypogammaglobulinaemia, which may further the risk of infection.  
The frequencies of Infections – Overall were similar across the target dose levels: 72.7%, 
67.1%, and 73.9% at the target doses of 150, 300, and 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 
respectively. The frequency of Infections did not appear to increase over time: 39.1% of 
subjects experienced Infections – Overall within the first 8 weeks, 27.8% of subjects > 8 to 
≤ 16 weeks, and 29.2% of subjects > 16 weeks to ≤ 6 months after infusion.

Secondary Malignancies 
Important Potential Risk: Secondary Malignancies  
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Secondary malignancies from Abecma is considered an important potential risk based on 
the theoretical risk of vector insertional mutagenesis leading to oncogenesis. No 
insertional mutagenesis or malignancies of T cell origin have been reported or identified 
to date in the clinical study setting. In the pooled analysis, no secondary malignancies 
from insertional oncogenesis have been reported after Abecma infusion, including initial 
infusion and retreatment, as of the data cut off dates. 
Other secondary malignancies were reported for 16 (8.7%) of 184 subjects who received 
Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells. Fifteen (8.2%) 
subjects developed secondary malignancies after initial Abecma infusion. Almost one-half 
of the secondary malignancies were basal cell carcinomas (6 [3.3%] subjects); 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was reported for 2 (1.1%) subjects and Bowen’s 
disease for 2 (1.1%) subjects. Anal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, lung 
adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were reported for 1 
(0.5%) subject each. Two subjects in Study CRB-401 had multiple malignancies, 
including 1 subject who had both basal cell skin carcinoma and bladder cancer and 
another who had both basal cell skin carcinoma and malignant melanoma. 
The occurrence of secondary malignancies in cancer patients has increased as 
improvements in cancer therapies and cancer detection have led to larger number of 
long-term cancer survivors. Results of a population-based study of 19,791 patients with 
MM showed that a prior malignancy diagnosis was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of developing a subsequent malignancy. Results of another large, 
population based study (including 8740 patients with MM) showed that the risk of 
developing any secondary malignancy is 26% higher in patients with MM compared with 
the general population, with an 11-fold increased risk of developing acute myeloid 
leukaemia and MDS, and a 2-fold increased risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer. 
In general, the risk of developing cancer is greater in older than in younger patients. In the 
pooled analysis, the median age of all subjects was 61.0 years. 
At present after surviving from a primary malignancy, 17% to 19% patients develop 
second malignant neoplasm (SMN). This is due to three reasons: continued lifestyle, 
genetic susceptibility, and treatment modality. In the United States National Cancer 
Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) programme, it was 
observed that proportion of SMNs was doubled in the last three decades (9% in 1975 
through 1979 to 19% in 2005 through 2009). Interventions to reduce the risk of SMN can 
be considered during or following treatment for the first cancer. Lifestyle interventions 
after treatment such as quitting smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, regular exercise 
and weight loss may be effective in reducing the incidence of SMNs. 
For Studies MM-001 and CRB-401, there appears to be low risk of insertional 
mutagenesis leading to oncogenesis of Abecma within the vector copy number range that 
was characterised (up to 16.4 copies/CAR+ T cell). Although viral insertional 
mutagenesis is a potential risk in CAR T production, Abecma reduces the risk by the 
lentiviral nature and self-inactivating design of the vector and by transducing mainly 
mature peripheral blood T cells as opposed to stem/progenitor cells.

Generation of Replication Competent Lentivirus 
Important Potential Risk: Generation of Replication Competent Lentivirus 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Lentiviral vectors used to transduce host autologous T cells for Abecma manufacture are 
engineered to be replication-incompetent and self-inactivating. There have been no reports 
of RCL generated during lentiviral vector manufacturing from Abecma and there have 
been no Abecma subjects who have shown evidence of RCL. 
RCL has not been detected in third-generation lentiviral vector products manufactured for 
clinical use suggesting that current vector design and vector product screening provide a 
high level of assurance regarding the absence of replicating virus. The potential generation 
of RCL during manufacturing remains a theoretical possibility that cannot be entirely 
excluded and RCL has the potential to increase the possibility of Abecma transgene 
mediated transformation. However, all available evidence suggests that the overall risk is 
very low.

Immunogenicity 
Important Potential Risk: Immunogenicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In the pooled analysis from MM-001 and CRB-401 clinical studies, 41 (22.3%) subjects 
who received Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells had 
≥ 1 immunogenicity event.  
Rash was reported for 13 (7.1%) subjects in the pooled analysis: 4 (5.7%) subjects who 
received Abecma at a target dose of 300 × 106 CAR+ T cells and 9 (9.8%) subjects who 
received Abecma at a target dose of 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells. Infusion related reaction was 
reported for 9 (4.9%) subjects in the pooled analysis: 5 (7.1%) subjects who received 
Abecma at a target dose of 300 × 106 CAR+ T cells and 3 (3.3%) subjects who received 
Abecma at a target dose of 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells.  
In Study MM-001, of the 128 subjects who received Abecma across the target dose levels 
of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 5 (3.9%) were positive for antidrug antibodies (ADAs) 
prior to Abecma infusion (ie, pre-positive), 122 (95.3%) were negative for ADAs prior to 
Abecma infusion (ie, pre-negative), and 1 (0.8%) subject was missing data pre-infusion. 
The 5 subjects who were pre-positive were also positive for ADAs after Abecma infusion 
(ie, post-positive). As of the Safety Update data cutoff date (16 Oct 2019), 62 (48.4%) of 
128 subjects were negative for ADAs prior to Abecma infusion and became positive for 
ADAs after Abecma infusion (ie, pre-negative to post-positive). 
In Study CRB-401, of the 56 subjects who received Abecma across the target dose levels 
of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, 3 (5.4%) subjects were positive for ADAs prior to 
Abecma infusion (ie, pre-positive), and 50 (89.3%) subjects were negative for ADA prior 
to Abecma infusion (ie, pre-negative), and 3 (5.4%) subjects were missing pre-infusion 
data. As of the Safety Update data cutoff date (22 Jul 2019), 31 (55.4%) of 56 subjects

were negative for ADAs prior to Abecma infusion and became positive for ADAs after 
Abecma infusion (ie, pre-negative to post-positive). 
No immunogenicity adverse events specific to the development of ADA (PTs of antibody 
test abnormal, antibody test positive, inhibiting antibodies, inhibiting antibodies positive, 
neutralising antibodies, and neutralising antibodies positive) nor specifically attributed to 
ADA were identified, therefore, no definitive conclusions regarding the association of 
ADA positivity with immunogenicity adverse events can be drawn. 
No known risk factors or risk groups.

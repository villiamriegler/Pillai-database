2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially applied indication for Pylclari was for the use for imaging in patients undergoing oncologic 
diagnostic procedures describing function or diseases when increased expression of prostate specific 
membrane antigen is a diagnostic target; in the following settings:  
• Initial staging of prostate cancer in patients at risk of metastases, who are candidates for definitive 
therapy;  
• Localisation of recurrence in case of rising serum PSA levels after treatment. 
The finally approved indication for Pylclari is for the the detection of prostate-specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA) positive lesions with positron emission tomography (PET) in adults with prostate 
cancer (PCa) in the following clinical settings:  
• Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to initial curative therapy;  
• To localize recurrence of PCa in patients with a suspected recurrence based on increasing serum 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after primary treatment with curative intent. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a disease affecting more than 2.3 million men in the United States (US) and 
around 4 million in Europe. Annually, nearly 181,000 new cases of PCa are diagnosed in the US, 
coupled with approximately 417,000 newly diagnosed cases in Europe (Ferlay et al., 2013; Siegel et 
al., 2020). 
It is estimated that PCa will affect one in six men in their lifetimes, leading to approximately 261,000 
deaths per year in developed countries worldwide (Ferlay et al., 2010).  
The mortality from the disease is second only to lung cancer in men. (Ferlay et al., 2013; Siegel et al., 
2020). The vast majority of men dying of PCa succumb to metastatic disease. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Prostate-specific antigen is a serine protease enzyme produced by the columnar epithelium of prostatic 
tissue. The proenzymatic intracellular form of PSA is pro-PSA. Following cellular production, pro-PSA 
passes through the basal and endothelial cell layers before entering the prostatic ducts, where it is 
converted to active PSA, finally penetrating the capillary membranes to enter the systemic circulation 
(Schedlich et al., 1987). A small portion of this active PSA then undergoes proteolysis, becoming 
inactive or "free" PSA when it enters the bloodstream and remains unbound. Active PSA that reaches 
the bloodstream rapidly becomes bound to circulating protease inhibitors (Mikolajczyk et 
al., 2002). The age-adjusted percent free to protein-bound PSA ratio is a useful indicator of cancer as 
the free PSA/total PSA ratio tends to decrease in malignancy. PSA levels also increase with age. 
Prostate cancer cells do not produce more PSA than benign cells; in fact, they tend to manufacture 
less. However, malignant cells will more easily allow PSA to pass through the cell wall into the 
surrounding extracellular fluid and eventually reach the bloodstream. This is because malignant 
prostate cells lack a basal layer that would otherwise restrict the passage of PSA outside the cell. Very

high Gleason score cancer cells that are highly undifferentiated may not produce a significant amount 
of PSA (David and Leslie; 2023). 
Prostate-specific membrane antigen is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, also known as folate 
hydrolase I or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, and is a biological target for diagnostic imaging and 
therapy in PCa (Silver et al 1997, O’Keefe et al 2018). PSMA is expressed in normal human prostate 
epithelium at low levels but may be overexpressed by malignant tissues, particularly by prostate 
cancer cells, including metastatic disease. PSMA is highly expressed in nearly all prostate cancers, 
including adenocarcinoma, but has restricted and several hundred-fold lower expression in some 
normal tissues such as the duodenal mucosa, renal proximal tubules, and salivary glands (Bostwick et 
al 1998, Sokoloff et al 2000, Chang 2004, Ghosh and Heston 2004). Most of the cancers in the 
prostate originate in the peripheral zone. The vast majority of prostate cancers are arising from 
adenocarcinomas. Prostate cancer is generally multifocal and present throughout the gland. The spread 
of the disease may occur initially through the capsule where the ejaculatory ducts enter the prostate or 
in the region of the bladder neck and can progress to the seminal vesicles or the bladder to invade the 
surrounding tissues and muscles. The degree of differentiation has prognostic value and is graded 
using the Gleason grading system. The scale measures the patterns of growth from 1-5 and the 
differentiation of cells from well to poorly differentiated. (Humphrey., 2004). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The risk of clinically significant prostate cancer is related to age, ethnicity, family history, PSA level, 
free/total PSA ratio and findings on digital rectal examination (Thompson et al., 2006). Physicians are 
encouraged to use risk calculators incorporating these factors.  
The clinical picture of PCa is variable and may range between asymptomatic, microscopic, well-
differentiated tumour that may never become clinically significant to the rarer screen detected, or 
clinically symptomatic aggressive, high-grade cancer that causes metastases, morbidity, and death. 
Diagnostic work-up of PCa is complex. Diagnostic tools include PSA testing, digital rectal palpation, 
transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), prostate biopsy, and histopathologic examination (Schwarzenböck et 
al., 2012, Smith et al., 2016, Prasad et al., 2016). Additionally, further imaging techniques such as, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scintigraphy, computer tomography (CT), and positron 
emission tomography (PET)/CT with (18F)Fluorodeoxyglucose, (18F)Choline, (11C)Choline and the 
more recently approved (18F)fluciclovine are used (Schwarzenböck et al., 2012; Nanni et al., 2016, 
Odewole et al 2016). Two main pivotal time-points in terms of decision-making on treatment strategy 
are primary staging of PCa, that takes place in the patients with confirmed PCa, before the first 
definitive therapy is started, and confirmation of PCa recurrence and staging in the patients who 
developed increased PSA after curative treatment of PCa (i.e., patients with so called biochemical 
recurrence – BCR). In both cases, gained information can direct clinical decision-making and may have 
impact on subsequent treatment strategy and clinical outcomes, such as patients’ survival.  
Detection of small lymph node metastases is a particular challenge for morphological imaging methods 
because diagnosis of disease typically requires a minimum lesion size (e.g., 10 mm) which precludes 
the detection of smaller metastases and microscopic disease. In addition, morphological changes are in 
many cases not specific for PCa but can also occur as the consequence of other conditions such as 
infection or inflammation, which makes the correct detection of PCa lesions even more difficult 
(Blomqvist et al., 2014; Hricak et al., 1987; Scheidler et al., 1999; Shinohara et al., 1989). 
Hybrid functional and structural imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) have 
been increasingly used in the diagnosis and follow-up of PCa.

which visualize the choline metabolism associated with the tumour cells, are being used in the EU for 
detection of recurrences of prostate cancer in any location (both local, regional and distant).  
Other diagnostic method extensively used is functional imaging used in nuclear medicine, specifically, 
radionuclide bone scintigraphy, and four metabolic radiopharmaceuticals for direct visualisation of 
lesions of primary and/or recurrent PCa that are approved for routine use in EU: 
•  18F-FCH from several marketing authorisation holders is currently approved for functional 
imaging of PCa lesions in several EU countries for: -Initial staging of prostate cancer in high 
risk patients; -Localisation of locoregional or distant recurrence in case of rising serum PSA 
levels after treatment. 
•  18F-fluciclovine, for: Detection of recurrence of PCa in adult men with a suspected recurrence 
based on elevated blood PSA levels after primary curative treatment.  
• 
gozetotide (PSMA-11) under the trade name Locametz (EMEA/H/C/005488) as a kit for 
radiopharmaceutical preparation to be radiolabelled with Gallium-68 for:- Primary staging of 
patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative therapy, - Suspected PCa recurrence in 
patients with increasing levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after primary curative 
therapy, - Identification of patients with PSMA-positive progressive metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) for whom PSMA-targeted therapy is indicated. 
•  Additionally, the radiopharmaceutical ready for use, 18F-PSMA-1007, under the trade name of 
Radelumin has been approved in some Member States with two strengths, 1300 MBq/mL and 
2000 MBq/mL, for:- Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to primary curative 
therapy; - Suspected PCa recurrence in patients with increasing levels of serum prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) after primary curative therapy. 
However, as bone scintigraphy detect tissue remodelling, as opposed to tumour burden, false positive 
results can be caused by inflammation, previous bone injuries, and arthritis. 18F-fluorocholine (18F-
FCH) has been reported as comparably sensitive to 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) PET for detection of 
bone metastases (Beheshti et al., 2010; Langsteger et al., 2011). In addition, they are not considered 
sufficiently sensitive methods, especially for the detection of metastases in other regions of the body 
(Bauman et al., 2012), and in recurrent PCa with low PSA levels (Calais et al., 2019; Evans et al., 
2018; Nanni et al., 2016). 
In response to this necessity to stage high-risk PCa accurately and reliably detect recurrent or 
metastatic disease, new prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMAs) have been developed. 
The joint guideline on diagnosis and management of prostate cancer from European Association of 
Urology (EAU), European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), European Society for Therapeutic 
Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO), European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) and International 
Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) (Mottet et al., 2022) and the latest guideline from ESMO (Parker 
et al., 2021) recommend that for primary staging the patients with intermediate-risk disease are 
staged for metastases using MRI or CT (abdomen and pelvis) and bone scan and those with high-risk 
disease using CT (chest, abdomen and pelvis) and bone scan. Mottet et al., state that in the primary 
staging “PSMA PET/CT is more accurate for staging than CT and bone scan for high-risk disease but to 
date no outcome data exist to inform subsequent management” (level of evidence: 1b) and that 
“When using PSMA PET or whole body MRI to increase sensitivity, be aware of the lack of outcome data 
of subsequent treatment changes.” (strength rating: strong). In this setting ESMO recommends not to 
base clinical decision-making on the outcomes of 68Ga-PSMA PET, as impact of this diagnostic tool on 
clinical outcomes has not been evaluated (Parker et al., 2021).

For patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, PSMA-PET imaging is replacing conventional 
imaging, based on its superior sensitivity and specificity. (Perera et al. 2020). Nevertheless, there are 
no trials indicating that the earlier detection of recurrence and subsequent change in management 
improves outcomes. The study of modern imaging methods has focused on their diagnostic 
performance, not their effect on care pathways. (Perera et al., 2020; Parker et al., 2021). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Depending on the stage (primary localised/locally advanced, recurrent PCa, metastatic/non-metastatic, 
etc.), patient’s age (estimated life-expectancy), condition of a patient, risk profile (low-, intermediate-, 
high-risk PCa), etc., watchful waiting, active surveillance, or different treatment strategies (e.g., 
focal/systemic, definitive/palliative, surgical/non-surgical) can be utilized. Typically, in patients with 
primary high-risk PCa radical prostatectomy with or without lymph node dissection or radiation therapy 
are utilised with curative intent. However, immediate systemic treatment with androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) to palliate symptoms and reduce the risk for potentially serious sequelae of advanced 
disease (spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, ureteral obstruction) is recommended if 
presence of metastatic disease (M1) has been confirmed and a patient is symptomatic. ADT as part of 
the adjuvant therapy is also recommended after radical prostatectomy in the patients with cancer-
positive lymph nodes (LN1). In the patients with suspected recurrence of PCa focal or systemic therapy 
options exist, including salvage radiation therapy, brachytherapy, etc., depending on the staging, type, 
prior treatment received, patient’s condition, etc. (Mottet et al., 2022). Correct decision-making is 
heavily dependent on the accuracy of the diagnostic methodology used. 
2.2.  About the product 
Piflufolastat (18F) is the International Non-proprietary Name (INN) for the active substance 2-(3-(1-
carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido) pentanedioic acid (18F-
DCFPyL).  
18F-DCFPyL is a Glu-ureido-based, small-molecule, fluorine-18 labelled, ligand that targets the 
extracellular domain of PSMA with high affinity, first discovered and synthesised at the Johns Hopkins 
University (Ghosh and Heston, 2004).  
18F-DCFPyL or piflufolastat (18F) as a ligand of PSMA, labelled with 18F, which is positron emitting and 
has a 109.8-minute half-life was developed as a radiopharmaceutical for use with PET. 
No secondary pharmacology studies were submitted, which is acceptable. As the maximum theoretical 
instantaneous blood concentration is ≤18 nM, following IV administration of 18F-DCFPyL at a 
recommended dose of 330 MBq, the potential for off-target pharmacological effects is expected to be 
negligible. 
18F-DCFPyL injection is intended to be used as a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agent for PCa. The 
injected chemical mass dose of DCFPyL in each 18F-DCFPyL / piflufolastat (18F) administration is a 
microdose of ≤40 µg, with a maximum theoretical instantaneous blood concentration of 18 nM. 
In comparison with 68Ga-labelled ligands of PSMA (Calais et al., 2019; Fendler et al., 2019), 18F-
DCFPyL could offer an advantage of higher production capacity and a longer half-life of Fluor-18, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 16/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
allows for wider product distribution and accessibility to patients (Werner et al., 2020; Szabo et al., 
2015). 
The proposed commercial formulation of 18F-DCPyL (piflufolastat (18F); Tradename: Pylclari) is a one-
vial solution for injection. It is a sterile and isotonic solution, containing (18F) piflufolastat as an active 
substance and ethanol anhydrous, 0.9% sodium chloride and sodium ascorbate as excipients. This 
medicine is administered intravenously for diagnosis purpose by Position Emission Tomography (PET). 
Pylclari, solution for injection, is a second-generation fluorine-18-labeled small-molecule PSMA inhibitor 
binding PSMA. 
Posology: The mean recommended activity of (18F) piflufolastat is 4 MBq/kg of body weight and can 
vary from 3 to 5 MBq/kg of body weight depending on the PET equipment and acquisition mode used. 
The minimum activity should not fall below 190 MBq and the maximum activity should not exceed 360 
MBq.

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
A scientific advice from the EU Scientific Working Party was received on 25-July-2019 on quality, non-
clinical and clinical development package. Two main clinical trials (Phase II/III – OSPREY trial and 
Phase III – CONDOR trial) sponsored by the applicant were presented and meant to provide key data 
on diagnostic efficacy, technical performance, impact on decision-making and patient management, 
and safety to support a marketing authorisation (MA) application. The information package provided by 
the applicant suggested that limited data were available on 18F-DCFPyL  / piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT, 
and that these were likely insufficient for MA in the targeted indication, i.e. staging of high risk 
prostate cancer patients and localisation of locoregional recurrence, or metastatic disease. The 
fundamental requirement is that Phase III clinical trials consist of adequate and well-controlled data of 
good quality from a sufficient number of patients representative for the targeted patient population, 
collected by a sufficient number of investigators, demonstrating a positive benefit/risk at the intended 
dose and manner of use (see “Points to Consider on Application with 1. Meta-Analyses; 2. One Pivotal 
Study”; CPMP/EWP/2330/99). The presented clinical trials did not appear to fulfil these requirements. 
Generally, clinical relevance of the 18F-DCFPyL / piflufolastat (18F) PET-based decision-making and 
benefit provided by the 18F-DCFPyL / piflufolastat (18F) PET in terms of improved diagnosis/patient 
management will need to be discussed/addressed at the time of the application for MA. 
A follow-up scientific advice from the EU Scientific Working Party was received on 12 December 2019 
on clinical development package. The applicant sought confirmation that OSPREY study could be 
considered as comparative study fulfilling the EU guideline recommendations. The applicant sought 
additional confirmation of the imaging assessment method; the totality of evidence needed to establish 
the diagnostic efficacy; the use of the OSPREY study to support the demonstration of the benefit / risk; 
and the choice of the comparator.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing as active substance either 
1000 MBq/mL or 1500 MBq/mL of piflufolastat (18F) at the date and time of calibration (that is set 1 
hour after the end of the synthesis).  
Other ingredients are: anhydrous ethanol, sodium ascorbate and 0.9% sodium chloride. 
The product is available in type I glass vials closed with a chlorobutyl stopper and an aluminium seal as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
Each vial of the finished product can contain between 0.5 and 10 mL, that correspond to a total 
radioactivity per vial between 500 Mbq and 10,000 Mbq for the 1,000 MBq/mL strength and between 
750 MBq and 15,000 Mbq for the 1,500 MBq/mL strength, expressed at calibration time. 
2.4.2.  Active substance ((piflufolastat (18F)) 
As usual for PET radiopharmaceuticals containing F-18, the active substance cannot be isolated and it 
is synthesised and purified during the manufacture of the finished product using a non-radioactive 
chemical precursor as the key starting material. According to the guideline on radiopharmaceuticals, 
this chemical precursor should satisfy the requirements of the Note for Guidance on Summary of 
Requirements for Active Substances in Part II of the Dossier. Thus, the dossier includes a complete 
module 3.2.S. for the chemical precursor and a second module 3.2.S for the radiolabelled active 
substance. 
General information 
The proposed INN (and adopted USAN) of the active substance is piflufolastat (18F) which chemical 
name is 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoropyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic 
acid. It contains almost the same structure of the chemical precursor but with the ammonium group 
substituted by the radionuclide F-18 and the three carboxylic acids de-protected. The molecular 
formula is C18H23
18FN4O8. It has a relative molecular mass of 441.4 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 18/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the active substance is synthesised with an automated unit through a continuous process leading to 
the finished product, without isolation of any intermediate, no structure elucidation of the active 
substance has been performed. All investigations performed have therefore been carried out with a 
nonradioactive [19F]-Piflufolastat, whose structure is identical to those of [18F]-Piflufolastat active 
substance.  The structure of [19F]-Piflufolastat was elucidated by FT-IR, LC-MS, and NMR 
Due to the radioactive nature and the short half-life of 18F of approximately 110 minutes, the 18F 
containing [18F]-Piflufolastat itself cannot be handled as an active substance. It is never isolated as 
such during the manufacturing process and is directly transferred into the finished product.  All studies 
on the appearance and solubility have therefore been carried out with a nonradioactive [19F]-
Piflufolastat, analogue of [18F]-Piflufolastat active substance. 
The active substance is a white to slightly yellow solid, solubility in solution in acetonitrile:water (1:1) 
is > 1 000 mg/mL. 
Two chiral centers (L,L) are introduced by the L-Lysine and the L-Glutamic acid moieties. The 2 steps 
synthesis of the active substance (labelling and deprotection) have no impact on the chirality of the 
molecule, that remain unchanged from the precursor. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The same sites manufacturing the finished dosage form are also the manufacturers of the radiolabelled 
active substance. Nine sites are proposed: Curium PET France, Sarcelles, France; Curium PET France, 
Janneyrias, France; Curium PET France, Pessac, France; Curium Pharma Spain, Madrid, Spain; Curium 
Pharma Spain, Sevilla, Spain; Curium Italy S.r.l., Milan, Italy; SYN Innovation Laboratories, Korinthia 
Prefecture, Greece; Argos Zyklotron Betriebs GmbH, Linz, Austria; and MAP Medical Technology Oy, 
Helsinki, Finland.  
The manufacturing encompasses the manufacturing process starting with the production of the 
radionuclide, radiolabelling of the chemical precursor, hydrolysis, purification, and formulation. 
The active substance is synthesised in 2 main stages: manufacture of precursor (FTNR-088) and 
manufacture of final active substance (([18F]-DCFPyL)) 
Chemical Precursor (FTNR-088) 
According to the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals, information on chemical precursors is presented 
in a separate section 3.2.S in Module 3. 
General information (Chemical precursor) 
The chemical name of the precursor is 5-(((S)-6-(tert-butoxy)-5-(3-((S)-1,5-di-tert-butoxy-1,5-
dioxopentan-2-yl) ureido)-6-oxohexyl)carbamoyl)-N,N,N-trimethylpyridin-2-aminium 
trifluoromethanesulfonate corresponding to the molecular formula C34H56F3N5O11S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 650.84 and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 19/139 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Chemical Precursor structure 
The chemical structure of the precursor was elucidated by a combination of FT-IR, LC-MS, HR-MS and 
NMR.  
The precursor is a white to slightly yellow solid soluble in organic solvents such as dichloromethane, 
ethanol, methanol and acetonitrile.  
The precursor exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 2 chiral centres. 100 % pure [S, S]-
enantiomer is obtained. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls (chemical precursor) 
The manufacture is conducted by a single manufacturing site. 
A convergent route of synthesis with two arms is used. Each arm includes three steps and the common 
part of the process consists in a single step. The process includes six isolated intermediates. The final 
purification of the chemical precursor is achieved by crystallisation in MTBE/Ethanol. The selection of 
starting materials is justified according to ICH Q11 and are well defined with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Evaluation of impurities was conducted according to ICH guidelines. The evaluation (using a validated 
HPLC method) included impurities most likely to arise during the synthesis, purification, and storage. 
The impurity profile was monitored at each step during the synthesis process and the data for all three 
process validation batches for each step. The chemical precursor has been routinely monitored for 
potential impurities / degradation products and residual solvents. 
All impurities are controlled by specification (related substances, genotoxic impurities, residual solvents 
and other impurities) as per ICH guideline  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The precursor is packaged in a container closure system which consist of amber, Type I borosilicate 
screw-top glass vial and a black polyphenolic cap with PTFE liner which complies with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. Each vial is placed into an individual aluminum foil pouch 
and heat-sealed. 
Specification (Chemical Precursor) 
The chemical precursor specification  includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, IR), 
assay (HPLC), purity (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), triflate 
content (HPLC), chiral purity (HPLC),water content (KF), residual solvents (GC), microbial 
contamination (Ph. Eur.), and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The European Pharmacopeia includes a general monograph for chemical precursors for 
radiopharmaceutical preparations. Proposed specifications include most of the tests required by this 
general monograph and the proposed limits are according to the compendial requirements. The test 
procedures are described with the required level of detail and have been validated. The limits for 
individual impurities and for total impurities are according to the limits prescribed in the general 
monograph that sets an identification threshold of 2.0% and a limit of 3.0% for total unspecified

impurities. The control strategy for residual solvents is deemed acceptable. Tests to control the 
microbiological quality of the chemical precursor comply with the referred general monograph on 
chemical precursors. 
The control of the chemical precursor is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 3 commercial scale batches of the chemical precursor are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability (chemical precursor) 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of the precursor from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial packagefor up to 60 months under long term conditions (25˚C ± 
2˚C and 60 % ± 5 %) and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Additionally, stability studies are currently being conducted, on these three batches, on the bulk 
(before repackaging) at long-term stability study at -20˚C ± 5˚C for 24 months, intermediate stability 
study at 5˚C ± 3˚C for 12 months, and accelerated stability study at 25˚C ± 2˚C / 60 % ± 5 % RH for 
6 months. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification, assay, purity, related substances, 
water content, microbial contamination and bacterial endotoxins.  
No change and variability were observed at long-term condition and accelerated condition until 9 
months either packaged or bulk. 
Freeze-thaw stability study was also performed for one batch. Cycles showed no changes, hence the 
chemical precursor is stable during multiple freeze-thaw cycles.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 18 months after the re-
packaging into the commercial container when stored at 25°C± 2°C. 
Active substance ((piflufolastat (18F)) 
The active substance is manufactured by radiolabelling of the chemical precursor using an automated 
synthesizer. The manufacturing process consist on 4 main steps: labelling of the precursor, hydrolysis 
of the intermediate, purification by demi-preparative HPLC and formulation and transfer to dispending 
cell A.  
As the active substance is synthesised with an automated unit through a continuous process leading to 
the finished product, without isolation of any intermediate, the container closure system is only available 
for the finished product. 
Specification ((piflufolastat (18F))

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as clear, colourless solution with a pH ranging from 4.5 to 7.5. 
A single radioactive concentration (1000 MBq/mL at calibration time) was proposed with two 
alternative definitions of the calibration time (1 or 2 hours after the time of measurement of the 
activity of the bulk). This was not acceptable by CHMP as this would correspond to two different 
strengths according to the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals. For every batch, the calibration time 
should be defined at a single time point respect to the same time point of the manufacturing process. 
Therefore, the CHMP requested as major objection (MO) that two different strengths should be applied 
for. In response, the applicant applied for the two strengths and defined a single calibration time and 
the MO was considered satisfactorily resolved. 
Development objective was to provide a parenteral formulation suitable for intravenous injection with 
optimum stabilization against radiolysis and high patient convenience. 
Radiolabelled active substance is not isolated as such and is directly transferred into the manufacture 
of the finished product. 
Selected excipients are commonly used for the manufacture of intravenous injections. All excipients 
are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards except 
0.9 % NaCl which complies with internal monograph. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.  
The pH of the product is controlled within the range of 4.5 to 7.5. This pH is physiologically compatible. 
Isotonicity is achieved by using 0.9 % NaCl solution for dilution to radioactive concentration. 
Initially, a simple ethanol solution in sodium chloride was used for clinical studies. The commercial 
manufacturing processes was set-up to include a  radio synthesis optimisation and subsequently, 
increased yields of radioactivity and higher radioactivity concentration led to change in the formulation 
composition with the addition of sodium ascorbate to reduce radiolysis. 
The manufacturing of the finished product is conducted in a synthesiser. The formulation is determined 
by the continuous automated manufacturing process which produces the finished product. 
Overall, the following improvements were made during development test campaign: increase of the 
uncorrected yield, removal of TFA used in the purification eluent, replaced by orthophrosphoric acid 
without noticeable modification of the purification conditions and limitation of the radiolysis 
phenomenon leading to the presence of fluorides in the final product. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product was optimised first for clinical trials and also in 
preparation for commercial manufacturing to increase the yield and robustness. The manufacture of 
the finished product corresponds to the dilution to 1 000 or 1 500 MBq/mL at calibration time, 
sterilisation of the finished product by filtration on a 0.22 μm membrane taking place at the dispensing 
step. Dilution and dispensing are performed in a shielded isolator equipped with laminar air flow

equipment providing a class A.  The manufacturing process gives a low bioburden prior to sterile 
filtration and the aseptic dispensing process is validated at each manufacturing site.  
To evaluate of the bioburden prior to sterilising filtration, a bioburden test is performed on the bulk 
solution during the validation process studies. Apart from the aseptic processing inherent to the 
production of sterile parenteral finished products (controlled environment, pre-sterilized materials and 
pre-sterilized-equipment in a clean area), the microbiological safety of the manufacturing process is 
favoured by several process parameters like short process duration that limit the risk of microbial 
growth. In addition, radioactivity is also known for its anti-microbial effect. The sterilizing filtration step 
provides an additional guarantee to the microbiological safety of the manufacturing process. 
Two kind of sterilising-filters membrane (Polyethersulfone - PES and Mixed Cellulose Ester - MCE) were 
validate and used through the process validation studies performed at each manufacturing sites 
leading to sterile finished product batches. Additionally, for each sterilising filter, the minimum bubble 
point value was established to confirm the use of the supplier’s specification as routine specification 
limit for the filter integrity test. The final sterile filtration step of the manufacturing is crucial for the 
quality of the finished product. Consequently, the integrity of the sterile filter is regarded as critical and 
tested as process control. 
Finished product batches of are subject to testing for sterility and endotoxins as part of the finished 
product specification. Due to the short shelf-life the results of sterility testing will only be available 
after release for use of the finished product. 
The process validation and stability studies and experience with manufacture have confirmed the 
compatibility of the finished product with sterile 0.9 % sodium chloride solution. As regards to batch 
analysis results and stability data obtained for all validation batches, all tested parameters, comply 
with specifications for 11 hours. All the results obtained for the validation batches comply with the 
specifications. The compatibility of the finished product with sterile 0.9 % sodium chloride solution is 
thus demonstrated. 
The results of the leachables and extractable tests have been provided and are deemed satisfactory. 
The primary packaging is type I glass vials closed with a chlorobutyl stopper and an aluminium seal. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by 9 manufacturing sites. 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  5  continuous  main  steps,  steps  1  to  4  corresponding  to  the 
manufacture of the active substance (see above) and step 5 corresponding to the manufacture of the 
finished product consisting of a dilution for radioactive concentration adjustment, sterilisation, filling an 
sealing. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Validation reports 
cover  the  complete  manufacturing  process,  including  the  manufacture  of  the  radiolabelled  active 
substance and the subsequent dilution to target concentrations and aseptic filling into the final vials. This 
validation approach is  satisfactory and provided results would support the suitability of the process as 
it  is  proposed.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process.

required level of detail and validation data is provided. Each test and proposed limits are justified. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for six validation batches manufactured at each site batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 batches per strength manufactured on each manufacturing site of finished product 
stored for up to 11 hours after End of Synthesis under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) in upside-down position, according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Moreover, multidose stability studies were also performed for each container-closure system (different 
manufacturers)  respectively  strength  at  1  000  MBq/mL  and  1  500  MBq/mL.  The  vials  were  stored  at 
40°C  ±2°C  in  upside-down  position  until  expiry  time  of  the  drug  product,  i.e.  11  hours  after  End  of 
Synthesis. 
Additionally,  four  complementary  validation  batches  have  been  performed  with  the  highest  starting 
activities. 
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, pH, radiochemical purity and chemical purity.

As  regards  to  batch  analysis  results  obtained  for  the  batches  from  all  manufacturing  sites,  all  tested 
parameters  comply  with  the  shelf-life  specifications  during  the  11  hours  study  duration  when  stored 
upside-down at 25 ± 2°C and/or 40 ± 2°C for both minimum and maximum filled volumes. 
As regards to batch analysis results obtained for multidose stability study, all tested parameters comply 
with the specifications during the 11 hours study duration when packaged in multidose vials stored at 
40 ± 2°C for all container closure system manufacturers. 
Thus,  the  finished  product  does  not  require  any  special  storage  conditions  and  can  be  packaged  in 
multidose vials. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 11 hours from the end of manufacturing as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
During the assessment the CHMP requested the application of two defined strength(s) at a single 
defined calibration time instead one strengths according to the Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals 
instead of one strength with two calibration times. The applicant amended the expression of strength 
and calibration time in line with the CHMP’s requested and it was considered satisfactory. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

following a single IV dose in rats (report SB-MP001) was submitted. Further to the scientific advice 
from CHMP/SAWP received on 25 July 2019, the applicant also submitted results from in silico 
evaluation of potential mutagenicity of piflufolastat (18F).  
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Information presented in this section is based on data from Chen et al. (2011) and Roy et al. (2021).  
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
18F-DCFPyL is a novel urea-based, small molecule ligand of PSMA labelled with the widely available 
isotope fluorine-18. Urea based, low molecular weight ligands of Glutamate carboxypeptidase II 
(GCPII) were shown to bind strongly to the active site of PSMA, as shown by X-ray crystallography 
studies (Barinka et al., 2008) and have been shown to be internalised into the cell following ligand 
binding (Ghosh and Heston, 2004; Kiess et al., 2015). 
Published non-clinical pharmacology studies were presented to provide support for the recommended 
dose of 18F-DCFPyL of 330 MBq (9 mCi), administered by intravenous (IV) injection, as a PET imaging 
agent to patients with high risk, recurrent, or metastatic PCa. Formal in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacodynamics studies were not submitted by the applicant.  
Primary pharmacology was investigated in vitro using an enzyme-inhibition assay and in vivo in small 
animal PET imaging studies. DCFPyL was observed to bind competitively to PSMA expressing lymph 
node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 1.1 nM. 18F-DCFPyL 
showing high affinity binding (dissociation constant (Kd)=0.83±0.04 nM) to PSMA and high specific 
binding (85–98 %). 18F-DCFPyL showed PSMA-dependent uptake within PSMA-positive PC3 PIP1 
xenografts, reaching a value of 46.7±5.8% ID/g at 30 minutes post injection, which decreased by only 
about 10% over the ensuing 4 hours. The ratio of uptake within PSMA-positive to PSMA-negative 
tumours ranged from 40:1 to more than 1000:1 over the 4-hour time period of the study.  
The results showed significant uptake and retention in the PSMA positive tumour, and a rapid clearance 
from non-target organs (Roy et al., 2021).  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No data were presented which was considered acceptable by the CHMP (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects).  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No data were presented which was considered acceptable by the CHMP (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects).

In a PSMA-positive PC3 PIP mouse xenograft study, clear PSMA-dependent uptake within tumours was 
observed, reaching a value of 46.7±5.8%ID/g at 30 minutes post injection and decreased by only 
about 10% over the ensuing 4 hours. The normal organ demonstrating the highest uptake was the 
kidney, with a value of 74.1±6.6%ID/g at 30 minutes but clearing rapidly down to 7.4±0.9%ID/g at 4 
hours. Using the mouse biodistribution data from this study, the human radiation dosimetry values 
were estimated. The organ with the highest mean absorbed dose per unit administered activity was the 
urinary bladder wall, 0.15 mGy/MBq, followed by the kidneys at 0.05 mGy/MBq. The critical dose limit 
of 50 mGy was set in reference to the FDA Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, part 361.1 
(Radioactive drugs for certain research uses). As the bladder wall was considered the limiting organ 
(0.15 mGy/MBq), the maximal dose in MBq that could be administered was 50/0.15 = 333 MBq. 
The actual human dosimetry data (from Szabo et al. 2015), obtained from 4 patients with prostate 
cancer, showed that the absorbed doses were in the same ranges as those estimated from the mouse 
data. Similarly, the effective dose from [18F]DCFPyL determined from human data was 0.0165 
mSv/MBq or 6.1 mGy (0.61 rem) for an injected dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) which was similar to that 
estimated from the mouse data. The organs with the highest absorbed radiation dose were estimated 
for the kidneys (0.0945 mGy/MBq) followed by urinary bladder wall (0.0864 mGy/MBq). These organs 
were similarly identified using the mouse data as those receiving the highest absorbed dose (although 
the bladder wall was higher than the kidney based on the mouse data). Based on the critical dose limit 
of 50 mGy, the maximal dose in MBq that could be administered using the kidney 0.0945 mGy/MBq 
was 50/0.0945= 529 MBq (higher than the value 333 MBq estimated using the mouse data).

Data from a biodistribution study in mice showed rapid and high uptake in the kidney, as well as 
extensive bladder exposure, following IV injection of F-DCFPyL (Table 4; Chen et al., 2011), suggesting 
a urinary clearance for F-DCFPyL in mice. Indeed, in a phase 1 study by Szabo et al. (2015), 18F-
DCFPyL did not appear to undergo meaningful metabolism. Coupled with the concomitant high uptakes 
in the kidney and bladder, further support that 18F-DCFPyL / piflufolastat (18F) is renally excreted 
following IV administration in men with PCa. 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were submitted.

2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The potential toxicity of DCFPyL (non-radioactive) after a single dose administration was evaluated in a 
GLP-compliant extended single-dose toxicity study conducted in male and female Sprague Dawley rats 
with intravenous administration. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to 6 groups 
(n=5/gender/group) and dosed IV on Day 1 with 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg DCFPyL or vehicle control. 
Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical signs, body weight, body weight changes, and 
clinical and anatomic pathology. 
This study revealed no adverse effects up to the highest tested dose, 0.5 mg/kg, which is significantly 
higher than the estimated dose of the non-radioactive part to be administered to patients. 
Dosing solutions at 0.02 and 0.1 mg/mL were higher than the concentrations seen clinically (max 
clinical concentration 4μg/mL) and the rat volume/kg is far greater than the clinical volume (0.16 
mL/kg for a 60 kg patient). In the rat study the injection site was monitored during the observation 
phase (dosing day through day 3 and 15) of the study and also during physical examination on the day 
of weighing. No indication of any tail/injection site irritation was noted. 
Injection sites were collected during animal necropsy, which was an integral part of the study protocol. 
Five animals per sex per group were sacrificed on day 3 post-dose and 5/sex/group were sacrificed on 
day 15 post-dose. 
No adverse reactions were observed in any of the animals, and no deaths occurred at the highest 
tested dose of 0.5 mg/kg. This dose is over 875-fold higher than the maximum clinical dose of 40 
Assessment report

µg/patient (or 0.5714 µg/kg for a reference body weight of 70 kg); on a body surface area basis, this 
dose is approximately 142-fold higher, suggesting adequate safety margin. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeated dose toxicity studies have been submitted. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
A predictive toxicology study for the assessment of DNA reactivity (mutagenicity) using expert rule-
based and statistical-based (Q)SAR prediction methodology was submitted.  An in silico computational 
evaluation of 18F-DCFPyL was performed using DEREK Nexus, an expert knowledge-based tool and 
Sarah Nexus, a statistical-based tool.  
In Derek Nexus, the test item structure was imported through or developed in the software. Possible 
alerts fire in Derek because toxicophores in the processed structures match alerts in the knowledge 
base. Therefore, reasoning considers evidence outlined in a Derek Nexus predefined set of rules to 
provide a logical outcome. Similarly, in Sarah Nexus, the test item was also imported through its 
developed structure in the software in which the query test item was virtually fragmented. Each 
fragment was then assessed for generation of relevant hypotheses (i.e., fragments not out of domain) 
to generate hypothesis, signal, confidence and supporting examples. An overall prediction was the 
combination of both the prediction and the confidence. The mutagenic potential of 18F-DCFPyL was 
evaluated using both systems. As per results from Derek and Sarah reports, the 18F-DCFPyL was 
within the domain of application of the model. The parameters that have influenced the Derek Nexus 
prediction were the substructures in the input structure, which have a potential for mutagenicity, in the 
selected species, which is bacterium, i.e., the Ames' test.  
The Derek prediction indicated that the structure did not match any structural alerts or examples for 
the bacterial in vitro mutagenicity and that the structure did not contain any unclassified and 
misclassified features. As such, there were no features that were not found following a search in the 
reference set (data from public domain) and that the features were found in non-alerting mutagens in 
the reference set, respectively. The compound was predicted to be negative with 36% confidence for 
the 'Mutagenicity' endpoint in the Sarah methodology.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive toxicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
No other studies than an extended single-dose toxicity study were submitted. See 2.5.4.1.

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Consistent with the ICH guideline M3(R2) (Dec 2009) a formal local tolerance study was not performed 
as the mass of drug is very low (40μg max; microdose) and no novel vehicles are used. Information is 
however available from the single dose extended toxicity study performed in rats with iv injection. See 
2.5.4.1.  
All injection site tissue was recorded as appearing visually normal. Injection site (tail vein) 
histopathology evaluation showed 2/5 male and 2/5 female day 3 control rats had grade 1 perivascular 
mixed inflammatory infiltration of the injection site. Similarly,1/5 male and 1/5 female rats day 3 rats 
treated with 0.1 mg/mL (0.5mg/kg) DCFPyL had grade 1 perivascular mixed inflammatory infiltration 
of the injection site. Both control and 0.1 mg/mL (0.5 mg/kg) DCFPyL day 15 female and male rats 
injection sites had no abnormal findings. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of (18F) DCFPyL CURIUM (Pylclari) solution for injection, 
1000 MBq/mL was performed according to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006, and the Question and 
Answers document of the same Guideline (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1, 2016).

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The extended single-dose toxicity study revealed no adverse effects up to the highest tested dose, 0.5 
mg/kg, which is significantly higher than the estimated dose of the non-radioactive part to be

administered to patients.  
An issue has been identified regarding the choice of the control group in the extended single-dose 
toxicity study - control animals received 5% Dextrose solution, while this does not correspond to the 
vehicle used for the test article. The applicant was, therefore, asked to justify for the choice of the 
control group and discuss possible impact on the interpretation of the results of the study. In response, 
the applicant claimed that there was no impact on the interpretation of the results from the study. This 
was because neither the vehicle for the DCFPyL (0.9% sodium chloride) nor the 5% Dextrose 
administered to control animals provoke adverse reactions/toxicity and, in the extended single-dose 
toxicity study, no adverse reaction/toxicity signals were observed in the DCFPyL treated groups. A 
clear justification for the choice of the control group was not provided. Considering the results from the 
extended single-dose toxicity study and the large safety margins, the issue on the choice of the control 
group is not pursued. 
The lack of repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity studies is accepted considering the 
intended use of (18F) DCFPyL CURIUM and current guidelines. (18F) DCFPyL CURIUM is to be used as 
a diagnostic agent, with administration of a dose corresponding to not more than 40 µg of the non-
radioactive part of radiopharmaceutical. 
Non-clinical findings suggest that there is no concern regarding local tolerance for DCFPyL even when 
administered at much higher concentrations and volume/kg than present in clinical doses. This 
conclusion is also supported by human safety data, where no issues were identified with the local 
tolerance of [18F]-DCFpyL injection. Additionally, no literature data, suggesting any safety concern 
regarding injection site reactions related to the use of [18F]DCFPyL was identified. 
Taken together, the submitted data on primary pharmacodynamics provided adequate pharmacology 
support for the development of 18F-DCFPyL as a diagnostic agent for the detection of PCa. 
(18F) DCFPyL CURIUM, solution for injection is a microdose diagnostic agent which is administered at a 
low mass dose of ≤40 µg. It is highly selective to PSMA. The selectivity and the very low chemical 
mass in an administered dose renders any meaningful interaction with off target receptors, 
transporter, and ion channels, including hERG (human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene) potassium 
channel, highly unlikely (Guideline on the non-clinical requirements for radiopharmaceuticals 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018; European Medicines Agency (EMA). ICH guideline M3(R2) on non-
clinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorisation for 
pharmaceuticals Step 5 EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995, December 2009). No secondary pharmacology 
studies were submitted, which is acceptable. As the maximum theoretical instantaneous blood 
concentration is ≤18 nM, following IV administration of 18F-DCFPyL at a recommended dose of 330 
MBq, the potential for off-target pharmacological effects is expected to be negligible.  
No safety pharmacology studies were submitted, which is acceptable. According to EMA, “Guideline on 
the non-clinical requirements for radiopharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018), safety 
pharmacology studies for radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agents are not required. Based on the same 
rationale than above, the interaction of 18F-DCFPyLwith PSMA is unlikely to result in any clinically 
significant pharmacological or toxicological activity to result in any safety concern. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies and no secondary pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
were submitted. The maximum chemical mass of DCFPyL associated with the recommended dose of 
330 MBq is ≤40 µg. At such low chemical dose, DCFPyL is not expected to produce any meaningful 
pharmacologic effect, and the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions of 18F-DCFPyL with 
concomitant drugs is negligible. 
Formal in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics and metabolism studies were not submitted by the 
applicant. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 18F-DCFPyL were assessed based on the data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 31/139 
 
 
 
from a published study by Chen et al. (2011). This study performed in an animal model of disease, is 
considered adequate, as the tracer was shown to possess high in vivo stability and underwent basically 
no metabolic transformation after distribution. 
The methods of analysis developed at the Johns Hopkins University study (Chen et al. (2011)), based 
on the measurement of radioactivity concentrations in blood and tissues in mice, is considered 
adequate, as all counted samples were inside the linearity range established during operational 
qualification of the F-18 counting method. A relatively low bone uptake of 18F-DCFPyL  radioactivity 
(<1%ID/g at all time points) suggested a low potential for metabolic de-fluorination of 18F-DCFPyL in 
mice. In accordance, Szabo et al. (2015) reported no metabolism of 18F-DCFPyL was observed on 
radioHPLC analysis following IV administration in humans, thus, provided further support that it is not 
necessary to conduct metabolism studies in animals.  
The high kidney uptake (the mouse biodistribution data (chen et al., 2011)), coupled with extensive 
bladder exposure, suggested a renal clearance of 18FDCFPyL. Additionally, a relatively low bone 
uptake of 18F-DCFPyL radioactivity (<1%ID/g at all time points) suggested a low potential for 
metabolic de-fluorination of 18F-DCFPyL in mice. Furthermore, Szabo et al. (2015) reported no 
metabolism of 18F-DCFPyL was observed on radioHPLC analysis following IV administration in humans. 
As 18F-DCFPyL does not undergo meaningful metabolism following IV administration in humans, and 
considering the low mass dose administered, it is agreed that it is unnecessary to evaluate DCFPyL as 
an inhibitor or inducer of metabolic enzymes or transporters. 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were submitted. The extremely low mass dose is highly 
unlikely to inhibit or induce any of the metabolizing enzymes. Furthermore, since 18F-DCFPyL / 
piflufolastat (18F) does not undergo meaningful metabolism following IV administration in humans 
(Szabo et al., 2015), its pharmacokinetics would not be affected by concomitant inducers and/or 
inhibitors of metabolising enzymes. Taken together, the potential for meaningful 18F-DCFPyL / 
piflufolastat (18F) pharmacokinetic drug interactions is negligible and the absence of PK drug 
interactions studies is considered acceptable.  
The potential toxicity of DCFPyL (non-radioactive) after a single dose administration was evaluated in a 
GLP-compliant extended single-dose toxicity study conducted in male and female rats with intravenous 
administration. No adverse effects were identified up to the highest tested dose, 0.5 mg/kg, which is 
significantly higher than the estimated dose of the non-radioactive part to be administered to patients.  
No  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  and  no  reproductive  studies  were  submitted  which  is  considered 
acceptable taking into account the intended use of Pylclari and current guidelines. Pylclari is to be used 
as a diagnostic agent, with administration of a dose corresponding to not more than 40 µg of the non-
radioactive part of radiopharmaceutical. 
Regarding the genotoxicity assessment, given that both complementary computational methodologies 
support the same conclusion, it is considered that 18F-DCFPYL is expected to be devoid of mutagenic 
hazard as could be assessed by the Ames' test. The methodology of the predictive toxicology study for 
the assessment of DNA reactivity (mutagenicity) was adequately validated, according to the data 
provided in the study report. 18F-DCFPYL can be categorized in Class 5 (“No structural alerts or 
alerting structure with sufficient data to demonstrate lack of mutagenicity or carcinogenicity”) and no 
further testing is recommended following ICH M7 (2017). This product is to be treated as non-
mutagenic. This is endorsed and in agreement with the scientific advice provided by CHMP. 
No carcinogenicity studies nor reproductive toxicity studies were submitted, no further justifications 
were provided but, given the intended use (e.g. the therapeutic indication) and the currently available 
scientific guidance, this is considered to be acceptable.

Based on EMA “Guidelines on the nonclinical requirements for radiopharmaceuticals 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/686140/2018)” (EMA, 2018) and “Nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of 
human clinical trials and Marketing Authorisation (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995)” (EMA, 2009), and US 
FDA guidance “Microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs: Nonclinical study recommendations; 
Guidance for industry, 2018” (CDER, 2018), developmental and reproductive toxicity studies are not 
necessary because of the inherent radiation risk to the foetus from the radiopharmaceutical drug, 
which would be reflected in labelling. 
The justifications for the lack of dose formulation analysis for concentration, homogeneity, stability, 
and toxicokinetic analysis are essentially related to the nature of the formulation (a “true solution”, 
with a “very straight forward preparation”) and to the intravenous route of administration.  Considering 
the large safety margins, even if there were minimal inaccuracies and/or losses of the test article 
during the preparation procedure and dosing of the animals, these are not expected to be able to 
significantly impact the results. 
For drugs used at microdose levels in single dose extended toxicity studies the drug should be used by 
intended route of administration with toxicokinetic data, or via the i.v. route (ICH guideline M3(R2) 
(Dec 2009). In this case the drug solution was administered by intravenous route, wherein the drug 
preparation was deposited directly into the circulation the entire amount of the drug is available in the 
body for distribution, metabolism, pharmaco- toxicological actions and ultimate elimination. Thus, 
while safety margin based on Cmax or AUC are not available, two dose levels were evaluated with drug 
solution administered IV and the lack of toxicokinetic information is not considered to have impacted 
on the reliability of the study. 
It also has to be emphasized that the study procedure took into consideration a very large safety 
margin. The highest tested dose of 0.5 mg/kg is over 875-fold higher than the maximum clinical dose 
of 40 μg/patient (or 0.5714 μg/kg for a reference body weight of 70 kg); on a body surface area basis, 
this dose is approximately 142x higher. Therefore, even if there were minimal inaccuracies and/or 
losses of the test article during the preparation procedure and dosing of the animals, these are not 
expected to be able to significantly impact the results. 
According to the available guidance, investigation of local tolerance, where applicable, should be done 
as integral part of the extended single dose study, Data suggested that there is no concern regarding 
local tolerance for DCFPyL even when administered at much higher concentrations and volume/kg than 
present in clinical doses. This conclusion is also supported by human safety data, where no issues were 
identified with the local tolerance of [18F]-DCFpyL injection. Additionally, no literature data, suggesting 
any safety concern regarding injection site reactions related to the use of [18F]DCFPyL was identified.  
Pylclari solution for injection Refined PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is 
not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. A further screening for persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT assessment) is deemed not necessary.  
Therefore, Pylclari is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the nonclinical data package presented to support the application for Pylclari, solution for 
injection is considered satisfactory.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology studies of 18F-DCFPyL were conducted as sub-studies in OSPREY (PyL2301), 
where male subjects with high risk localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical 
prostatectomy (RP) with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), or presumptive recurrent or metastatic 
prostate cancer on conventional imaging, were administered with a single IV dose of 18F-DCFPyL at 
333 MBq. The following clinical pharmacology topics were investigated: 
• PK/distribution/disposition/ metabolite profiling/excretion, including effects of renal status on PK (10 
subjects in cohort A of the study – PK cohort) 
• Normal organ dosimetry (PK cohort, N=10) 
• Impact of renal function on diagnostic performance (all subjects in study, N=385) 
• Cardiovascular safety evaluation (all subjects in study, N=385) o 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) 
at pre-dose and pre-imaging

•  Bioavailability 
Not applicable: Pylclari is administered intravenously. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability is

Influence of food 
On empirical grounds, the 4- to 6-hours fast has often been recommended (Li X, Rowe SP, Leal JP, et 
al. Semiquantitative parameters in PSMA-targeted PET imaging with 18F-DCFPyL: variability in normal-
organ uptake. J Nucl Med.2017;58:942–946) before a patient undergoes PET/CT with 18F DCFPyL; 
however, a scientific underpinning for this recommendation is lacking. Wondergem et al. (2018) 
performed a study to determine the impact of fasting on 18F-DCFPyL in 50 patients who fasted at least 
6 hours before administration and 50 patients who did not.
Overall, these data showed that fasting did not significantly affect 18F-DCFPyL uptake in suspected 
malignant lesions but did result in significantly lower 18F-DCFPyL uptake in tissues with high 
physiologic uptake.  
•  Bioequivalence 
A single formulation of 18F-DCFPyL drug product has been used in the clinical studies. 
Biodistribution  
A pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort of 10 subjects was included in Study PyL2301 (OSPREY) to determine the 
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and excretion of 18F-DCFPyL, including metabolic profile in urine. 
Ten (10) subjects with high risk localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy 
with pelvic lymph node dissection (cohort A) in Study PyL2301 were enrolled. One subject had normal

kidney function at screening (eGFR≥90 mL/min/1.73m2) while the other nine subjects had mild kidney 
insufficiency  (60<eGFR<90).  Each  patient  received  a  single  intravenous  injection  of  18F-DCFPyLat  a 
target level of 333 MBq. 
Blood, urine and whole-body PET/CT scans were to be collected at the timelines noted in Table 8. 
Table 5. PK Sampling & Imaging Timepoints 
Analytical Methods 
Gamma counting method 
The gamma counting method used for measuring the radioactivity concentrations at specific time points, 
after the administration of 18F-DCFPyL to ten patients in the PK cohort of study PyL2301, was based on 
a publication by Lodge et al. (2015). 
Blood,  plasma,  and  urine  were  collected  and  counted  in  an  automated  γ-counter  that  consisted  of  a 
single 75-mm-diameter, 80-mm-high NaI (Tl) crystal with a 33-mm-diameter, 60-mm-deep hole. The 
detector was surrounded by 50 to 75 mm of lead shielding. The dead time correction efficacy, background 
correction accuracy, sample volume, and counting efficiency were optimized for Fluorine-18. 
Batch counting was done for the samples collected between 0 and 4, at 6, and at 8 hours post-injection. 
Radioactivity  of  all  counted  samples  was  within  the  linearity  range  established  during  operational 
qualification  of  the  Fluorine-18  counting  method.  The  raw  radioactivity  counts  were  converted  into 
radioactivity concentrations (μCi/mL) using an appropriately diluted aliquot of 18F-DCFPyL drug product 
as a reference standard. All resulting radioactivity concentrations were decay-corrected to the time of 
administration. 
HPLC/Radiometric method 
The HPLC/radiometric detection method used to determine the metabolic profile in urine, following 
administration of 18F-DCFPyL to ten patients in the PK cohort of study PyL2301 study, was based on a 
publication by Szabo et al. (2015). The chromatographic separation was achieved on Gemini 4.6×250 
mm C18 column with an isocratic elution using 10% acetonitrile/90% triethylammonium phosphate 
(pH 3.2) mobile phase at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.

The graph of 18F-DCFPyL blood concentrations vs. time is depicted in Figure 3. All values are expressed 
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). 
Figure 3: 18FDCFPyL Blood Concentrations vs. Time 
After  the  intravenous  administration  of  18F-DCFPyL,  the  blood  levels  rapidly  declined  in  a  biphasic 
fashion. The half-life of the alpha (distribution) portion of the curve was 0.17 ± 0.044 hours with the 
beta (elimination) half-life of 3.47 ± 0.490 hour. 
The terminal elimination phase was reliably established in two out of ten subjects resulting in half-life of 
3.33 ± 0.348 hour. 
The effective half-life of piflufolastat (18F) is approximately 70 minutes. 
The duration of the observation period in the study, however, was limited by a short decay half-life of 
the radioisotope (F-18, 110 minutes).

Table 6: Summary of 18F-DCFPyL Blood Pharmacokinetics in Ten Subjects with Prostate 
Cancer 
As listed in Table 10, the plasma-to-blood concentration ratios at any time-point for all subjects were 
between 1.441 and 1.829, indicating 18F-DCFPyL exhibited a restricted permeability into red blood cells 
(RBCs) (ratio of 1 corresponds to equal distribution between plasma and RBCs while ratio of 2 signifies 
a complete lack of permeability).

Accumulation 
Organ uptake 
Physiologic  accumulation  of  piflufolastat  (18F)  was  observed  in  the  kidneys  (16.5%  of  administered 
activity), liver (9.3%), and lung (2.9%), within 60 minutes of intravenous administration. Most of the 
remaining 70% of activity at 60 minutes was with the rest of the body background region.

Radiation Dosimetry 
Selection of Clinical Dose and Optimal Imaging Timepoint 
Prior  to  the  first-in-human  study  with  18F-DCFPyL  at  the  Johns  Hopkins  University  (JHU),  human 
dosimetry was extrapolated from a preclinical biodistribution study in xenograft mice. The urinary bladder 
wall was projected to be the organ with the highest absorbed dose. To limit the radiation-absorbed dose 
to the urinary bladder, the highest human dose was estimated to be 331.2 MBq. 
The  results  of  PK,  metabolism,  excretion,  dosimetry,  and  safety  evaluations  from  the  first-in  human 
study  at  JHU  were  reported  by  Szabo  et  al.  Physiologic  accumulation  of  18F-DCFPyL  was  shown  to 
correspond to the distribution of PSMA-expressing organs. Outside of the tumour, the longest residence 
time in normal organs was observed in kidneys, liver, muscle, and bladder. 
The effective dose from an injected dose of 333 MBq 18F-DCFPyL, calculated to be 0.0169 mSy/MBq or 
5.5  mGy  (0.55  rem),  was  comparable  to  that  of  other  radiotracers  used  in  oncology,  such  as  18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose. Therefore, a dosage of 18F-DCFPyL Injection of 333 MBq was selected for use in the 
phase 2/3 trial, OSPREY, and the phase 3 study, CONDOR. 
In  the  Szabo  et  al.  study,  the  highest  uptake  and  lowest  background  activity  were  observed  at 
approximately  1  and  2  hours,  respectively,  suggesting  that  the  optimal  imaging  time  point  following 
injection of 18F-DCFPyL could be 1-hour post injection. Therefore, PET/CT imaging was to be initiated 1 
to 2 hours after 18F-DCFPyL administration. 
Although no formal administered dose finding studies of 18F-DCFPyL were performed by investigators at 
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as part of the first-in-man study of this novel PSMA tracer, the dose of 
333 MBq was deliberately selected to be in line with both the ALARA principle and current 18F-FDG dose 
recommendations. 
Normal organ dosimetry 
Serial PET/CT images were collected in the 10 subjects of the PK cohort of study PyL2301 (OSPREY) at 
10 minutes, and 1- and 4-hours post-injection (times are nominal). 
Activity  concentrations  for  selected  tissues/organs  including  time-integrated  activity  coefficients  and 
clearance  rates,  and  radiation  absorbed  dose  estimates  were  calculated  following  three  consecutive 
PET/CT images for each subject. 
The absorbed radiation doses per tissue/patient are listed in Table 11. 
For all 10 patients, kidney was the organ with the highest absorbed dose. The mean effective dose to 
the whole body from 18F-DCFPyL was calculated to be 0.0116 mSv/MBq or 3.9 mGy (0.39 rem) for an 
injected dose of 333 MBq which is less than other commonly used tracers for oncologic imaging such as 
18F-FDG.

Table 8: Absorbed doses (mGy/MBq) per organ of the individual patients in PK cohort 
 Dosimetry 
Data listed below are from sponsored clinical studies (i.e. 10 subjects of the PK cohort of study 
PyL2301 (OSPREY). 
Assumptions: 
Fluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of 110 minutes by emitting a positronic 
radiation of maximum energy of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiations of 511 keV. 
Piflufolastat (18F) exhibits bi-exponential behaviour in blood, with a distribution half-life of 0.17 ± 
0.044 hours and an elimination half-life of 3.47 ± 0.49 hours. It distributes to the kidneys (16.5% of 
administered activity), liver (9.3%), and lung (2.9%), within 60 minutes of intravenous administration. 
Methodology: 
The time-integrated activity in source tissue was obtained from longitudinal imaging data. Contours or 
volumes of interest (VOIs) were typically drawn around different activity-containing organs that were 
identified on each image at each time-point. The S-value was obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The 
absorbed doses calculation was performed on OLINDA/EXM software (2005). The resulting effective 
dose was calculated according to ICRP 60.

The effective dose resulting from the administration of a maximal recommended activity of 360 MBq 
for an adult weighing 70 kg is about 4.2 mSv.  
For an administered activity of 360 MBq, the typical radiation doses to the critical organs (kidneys, 
liver and spleen) are 44.3 mGy, 13.3 mGy and 9.8 mGy respectively.  
Metabolism 
Analysis of urine samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) collected up to 8 hours 
post-injection demonstrated that in nine subjects all urine activities at all three collection intervals were 
in the form of unmetabolized parent compound (Figure 4)

from the serial PET/CT images. Together with the cumulative urine recovery (0-4 hours), the data 
established that urinary excretion was the predominant elimination route of 18FDCFPyL (Table 13). In 
the first 8 hours post-injection, approximately 50% of administered radioactivity was excreted in the 
urine.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Androgen Deprivation therapies 
While  there  was  no  concomitant  use  of  androgen  deprivation  therapy  (ADT)  in  patients  enrolled  in 
CONDOR, 55 patients (26.4%) had prior treatment with ADT. No difference was observed in the correct 
localisation  rate  (CLR)  of  18F-DCFPyL  in  patients  previously  treated  with  ADT  compared  with  those 
without prior treatment.  
In OSPREY Cohort B, one-third of the patients (32 out of 93) had concurrent ADT use, which was defined 
as medications with start dates prior to and ongoing at 18F-DCFPyL injection dosing. A post-hoc analysis 
on the effect of concomitant use of ADT on the efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL in the OSPREY Cohort B patients 
concluded to no difference in sensitivity or PPV in patients who received concomitant ADT when compared 
to patients without ADT use. 
Diuretics 
There were 20/252 (7.9%) evaluable patients in OSPREY Cohort A identified as concurrent diuretic 
users. In OSPREY Cohort B, there were 15/93 (16.1%), and in CONDOR there were 24/208 (11.5%) 
evaluable patients identified with concurrent diuretic use.   
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), is a trans-membrane glycoprotein primarily expressed in 
normal human prostate epithelium at low levels, but may be overexpressed by malignant tissues, 
particularly by prostate cancer cells, including metastatic disease. Fluorine (18F) is a β+ emitting 
radionuclide that enables positron emission tomography. Piflufolastat (18F) is a selective second-
generation fluorine-18-labeled small-molecule PSMA inhibitor. Based on the intensity of the signals, 
PET images obtained using piflufolastat (18F) indicate the presence of PSMA expressing tissues. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected in a total of 374 study subjects in OSPREY at 2 intervals 
on the day of study drug administration: pre-dose (Baseline) and prior to imaging.

prostate cancer have been characterized using information from the pharmacokinetic cohort of 10 
subjects in Study OSPREY (cohort A). Pharmacokinetics studies have not been conducted in healthy 
subjects following the recommendation of the 97/43/EURATOM Directive regarding the use of 
radioactive drugs only in subjects with a direct benefit. 
Absorption 
18F-DCFPyL is administered intravenously and therefore 100% bioavailable. The same formulation was 
used during the clinical development; consequently, there are no possible differences in excipients that 
could  interact  with  the  drug  substance.  Therefore,  no  comparative  bioavailability  or  bioequivalence 
studies were required. With regards to the influence of food in tissues uptake of DCFPyL, as the absolute 
differences in uptake between patients who fasted and patients who did not were relatively small, the 
effects of fasting on the diagnostic performance of Pylclari can be considered negligible. 
Distribution 
18F-DCFPyL is rapidly and extensively distributed following an IV dose with a distribution half-life (T 1/2 
alpha) of 0.17 ± 0.044 hours and steady state Volume of distribution (Vss) of 539.62 ± 51.961 mL/kg. 
Furthermore, 18F-DCFPyL exhibits a restricted permeability into red blood cells (RBCs). 
Since the terminal elimination phase was not reliably established in eight out of ten subjects, the derived 
pharmacokinetics  parameters  calculated  using  non-compartmental  model  in  those  subjects  (denoted 
with asterisk in Table 9) may not be accurate and should be interpreted with caution. 
Normal organ dosimetry 
According  to  the  effective  dose  (0.0116  mSv/MBq)  a  recommended  clinical  dose  of  333  MBq  of  18F-
DCFPyL  results  in  3.9  mSv,  a  value  comparable  to  the  radiation  effective  dose  of  other  Fluorine-18

radiopharmaceuticals such as 18F-FDG (0.019 mSv/MBq). The table containing the average of effective 
dose has been calculated according to the ICRP Publication 60 (1991). In view if a potential optimisation 
of the benefit risk balance, the effective dose will be updated post-approval according to the most recent 
ICRP Publication 103, 2007. New generation softwares that use anthropomorphic and biokinetic models 
for absorbed doses calculations as OLINDA/EXM version 2.0 or IDAC-Dose 2.1 should be used and the 
version number of the software should be included in the section 11 of the SmPC (REC). 
Elimination 
18F-DCFPyL is mainly excreted through urine. Data showed that approximately 50% of the administered 
radioactivity was eliminated by 8 hours post injection. 
Analysis  of  urine  samples  by  HPLC  collected  up  to  8  hours  post  dose  demonstrated  that  18F-DCFPyL 
does not undergo meaningful metabolism following IV administration. Only one subject showed potential 
minor metabolites. 
Impaired renal function 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment has not been characterised (see SmPC section 
5.2).  Data  from  the  subgroup  analysis  in  Osprey  study  showed  that  diagnostic  performance  was  not 
different  when  comparing patients  with normal  renal  function  to  patients  with mild  renal  impairment. 
However, the pharmacokinetics of 18F-DCFPyL was studied only in 10 patients, 1 with normal kidney 
function  at  screening  (eGFR  ≥  90)  and  9  subjects  with  mild  kidney  insufficiency  (60<  eGFR<90). 
Therefore, PK profile was mainly established for mild kidney insufficiency patients. For all 10 patients, 
kidney was the organ with the highest absorbed dose. The mean effective dose to the whole body from 
piflufolastat (18F) was calculated to be 0.0116 mSv/MBq or 3.9 mSv for an injected dose of 330 MBq. 
In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, slower excretion of piflufolastat (18F) is expected, 
and  the  mean  residence  time  will  be  increased.  There  are  no  data  on  radiation  dose  resulting  from 
administration of piflufolastat (18F) in those patients. Given the low micro-dose and short effective half-
life of approximately one hour (70 min), moderate or severe renal impairment was regarded unlikely to 
have a clinical impact on PK or biodistribution of piflufolastat (18F) with respect to safety or the imaging 
performance  and  no  dose  adjustment  is  proposed  for  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Careful 
consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation exposure 
is possible (see SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4).  
Impaired hepatic function 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment has not been characterised (see SmPC section 
5.2). 18F-DCFPyL is mainly eliminated by urinary excretion. In addition, 18F-DCFPyL does not seem to 
undergo  meaningful  metabolism.  In  this  sense,  liver  function  is  not  expected  to  affect  18F-DCFPyL 
disposition.  
Pharmacokinetics interactions 
No  dedicated  drug  interaction  study  were  submitted.  Due  to  the  extreme  low  chemical  mass  in  an 
administered dose of 18F-DCFPyL, meaningful interactions with metabolizing enzymes, transporters or 
ion channels are highly unlikely. In addition, 18F-DCFPyL does not undergo a meaningful metabolism, 
indicating  that  blood  concentrations  of  18F-DCFPyL  is  not  expected  to  alter  in  the  presence  of 
concomitant inducer or inhibitor drug. 
Available data did not show differences in sensitivity or positive predictive value (PPV) in patients who 
received concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapies (ADT) compared to patients who did not use ADT. 
No  special  recommendation  is  provided  regarding  the  concomitant  use  of  ADT.  Androgen  deprivation 
therapy  (ADT)  and  other  therapies  targeting  the  androgen  pathway,  such  as  androgen  receptor

antagonists, may result in changes in uptake of piflufolastat (18F) in prostate cancer. The effect of these 
therapies on performance of piflufolastat (18F) PET has not been established (see SmPC section 4.5). 
The use of diuretics at the time of administration of 18F-DCFPyL did not appear to impact the diagnostic 
performance  of  18F-DCFPyL  injection  in  newly  diagnosed  PCa  patients  or  patients  with  recurrent  or 
metastatic  disease.  Chronic  treatment  with  diuretics  does  not  seem  to  have  any  interference  with 
piflufolastat (18F) for interpretation of images (see SmPC section 4.5). However, these analyses need to 
be interpreted with caution due to small number of patients in certain cohorts and due to the post-hoc 
nature of these analyses. 
Pharmacodynamics 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, this medicinal product does not appear 
to have any pharmacodynamic activity because the injected mass is negligible (less than 40 μg). 
A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected in a total of 374 study subjects in OSPREY (safety set). 
The results showed no clinically relevant changes in QTc values between the pre-dose and pre-imaging 
time  points,  suggesting  the  potential  of  cardiovascular  risk  from  18F-DCFPyL  injection  is  minimal.  In 
addition,  18F-DCFPyL  is  a  microdose  radiopharmaceutical  diagnostic  agent  with  the  maximum 
administered  chemical  dose  of  ≤ 40  micrograms  and  maximum  theoretical  instantaneous  blood 
concentration is 18nM. The very low chemical mass in an administered dose of 18F-DCFPyL renders any 
meaningful  interactions  with  ion  channels  (e.g.,  hERG)  highly  unlikely.  The  results  suggest  that  18F-
DCFPyL administration is not linked to changes in QTc prolongation. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, the clinical pharmacology of piflufolastat (18F) has been adequately characterized and 
the rationale for the dosing is considered appropriate. Based on the available data, no dose adjustment 
is required in older patients, in patients with renal impairment or in patients with hepatic impairment. 
However, careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in patients with renal impairment is required 
since an increased radiation exposure is possible. No clinically significant interactions with other 
medicinal products are expected.  
In order to optimize the B/R, dosimetry will be re-calculated with new generation software and 
updated in accordance with ICRP Publication 103, 2007 (REC).  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This radiopharmaceutical is intended for the detection of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) 
positive lesions with positron emission tomography (PET) in adults with prostate cancer (PCa) in the 
following clinical settings (1) Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to initial curative 
therapy (2) To localize recurrence of PCa in patients with a suspected recurrence based on increasing 
serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after primary treatment with curative intent.

Meta-analyses  
Two meta-analyses: Pan et al., 2021 and 
Sun et al., 2019; both with nine studies 
and not performed by the applicant 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal dose-response study has been submitted with this application.  
The selection of clinical dose and optimal imaging timepoint have been established considering the 
following aspects: image quality, current guidelines for PET radiopharmaceuticals and radiation dose 
optimization. 
A high-quality PET image is one in which the proportion of true counts is maximized while minimizing 
noise. This value is commonly referred to as the Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR). This metric is 
useful to optimize the administered quantity of radiopharmaceutical by modeling of the Poisson 
distribution at various dosages. NECR has been shown to increase with injected activity at low levels 
but then plateau or even decrease at high levels. A nearly maximal value of NECR, where the value 
ceases to significantly increase with the administered dose, has been recommended as suitable 
criterion for determining the optimal dosage in a PET clinical study (Karakatsanis et al., 2015).  
The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has published guidelines for 18F-FDG PET in 
2015 which recognize a modern understanding of the quadratic relationship between administered 
dose and NECR (Boellaard et al., 2015). As such, the recommended range of activity for a 70 kg adult 
is 182-457 MBq corresponding to 2 and 5 minutes per bed position respectively. 
A concept applied to radiopharmaceutical dose selection in conjunction with statistical considerations is 
the ALARA principle (As Low As is Reasonably Achievable), where a reduced radiation dose to the 
patient and practitioners are preferred whenever possible. In a study of pediatric dose optimization 
using 18F-FDG PET, the optimal 90% NECR level for a 76 kg adult was characterized at 370 MBq 
(Accorsi et al., 2010). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 55/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, an optimal radiopharmaceutical dosage should not only allow for adequate statistical quality 
(>90% NECR) but also recognise that increasing the administered dose beyond this point results in a 
sharp increase in radiation dose with minimal gain in NECR. However, a simulation of reduced dose PET 
data and its effect on image quality was recently reported for 18F-FDG PET/CT (Seith et al., 2017). In 
this study, the authors concluded that administered doses in oncologic whole body examinations are 
not recommended to be reduced below 3 MBq/kg body weight due to degradation of the image quality. 
Although no formal administered dose finding studies of 18F-DCFPyL were performed by investigators 
at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as part of the first-in-man study of this novel PSMA tracer, the dose 
of 333 MBq was deliberately selected to be in line with both the ALARA principle and current 18F-FDG 
dose recommendations (Szabo et al., 2015). In that study, the optimal time point of imaging was 1-2 
hours post injection, and time per bed position by analysis of lesion uptake was described in a series of 
whole-body PET images. For these reasons, the applicant has carried forward the 333 MBq dosage as 
the stated optimal administered dose together with a recommended time per bed position of 2-5 
minutes (see also section 2.6.2).

OSPREY STUDY (Diagnostic performance against a standard of truth) 
Methods 
This was a phase 2/3, multi-center, multi-reader, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the 
diagnostic performance and safety of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to detect prostate cancer in two patients 
settings:  
•  Study Participants  
Men≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate. All patients 
provided informed consent before any study procedures were performed. 
Cohort A: Patients with high risk (or very high risk) prostate cancer as defined by National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Version 3.2016 (clinical stage≥T3a, PSA>20 
ng/mL, or Gleason score≥8) and are scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP) with pelvic 
lymph node dissection (PLND). 
Cohort B: Patients with radiologic evidence of local recurrence or new or progressive metastatic 
disease on anatomical imaging (CT, MRI, or ultrasound), whole-body bone scan (with 99mTc-MDP or 
sodium fluoride [18F-NaF]) within 4 weeks of Day 1, and are scheduled for percutaneous biopsy of at 
least 1 amenable lesion. If the patient had received prior treatment with radiation or ablative therapy, 
the patient had to have evidence of recurrence outside the confines of prior treated site(s). 
Exclusion Criteria 
-Patients administered any high energy (>300 KeV) gamma-emitting radioisotope within 5 physical 
half-lives, or any intravenous iodinated contrast medium within 24 hours, or any high-density oral 
contrast medium (oral water contrast was acceptable) within 5 days prior to study drug injection. 
-Patients with any medical condition or other circumstances that, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
compromised obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives, or study completion. 
-Cohort A: Patients with prior androgen-deprivation therapy or any investigational neoadjuvant agent 
or intervention. 
-Cohort B:  
1. Prior radiation or ablative therapy to intended site of biopsy, if within the prostate bed.  
2. Initiation of new systemic therapy for recurrent and/or progressive metastatic disease since 
radiographic documentation of recurrence/progression. 
•  Treatments 
18F-DCFPyL Injection, sterile solution for intravenous (IV) injection, 333 MBq at the time of 
administration, was administered by IV catheter in an antecubital vein or equivalent venous access. 
The bolus administration will be followed by a flush of 5-10 mL steril 0.9% sodium chloride injection, to 
ensure full delivery of the dose. The median decay corrected dose at the time of administration was 
340.4 MBq.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 59/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At 1 to 2 hours after injection of 18F-DCFPyL, the patient was asked to void, and whole body CT and 
PET scans were acquired from the mid-thigh through the vertex of the skull.  
Any new prostate cancer therapy was strictly prohibited from the time of study drug administration 
(Day 1) to surgery (Cohort A), or from the time of radiographic documentation of disease progression 
to biopsy (Cohort B). If a patient received a new prostate cancer therapy (e.g., hormone, drug, 
biologic, radiologic, chemotherapy) or alternate medical procedure(s) for prostate cancer during these 
time periods, the patient was withdrawn from the study. 
Twelve hours to 28 days post-18F-DCFPyL administration and imaging, patients underwent RP with 
PLND surgery (Cohort A) or had a follow-up biopsy (Cohort B). Patients whose planned procedure for 
prostate cancer changed (RP or biopsy) following 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging had any available 
corresponding histopathology data recorded for the alternate procedure. 
Main imaging parameters for PET/CT scanning in the Osprey Study:  
PET imaging with 18F-DCFPyL was performed locally using PET/CT scanners with low dose non-
enhancing CT for correction of physical effects (e.g., attenuation, scatter) and anatomic localization 
(transmission scan). Only oral water contrast was acceptable.  
Main parameters for PET/CT scanning were consistent through clinical studies. 
Mode:3D  
Patient Position: Supine with arms above head (unless patient is unable). 
Emission Scan: 2-5 min/bed position. 
Scan Field of View/Coverage: Mid-thigh through the vertex of the skull and must include bed positions 
of lower extremities if there is known or suspected disease. Scan from caudal/inferior to superior 
direction to reduce amount of tracer present in the bladder. 
Image Reconstruction: Iterative reconstruction algorithms shall be used (rather than filtered back 
projection). If available, Time of Flight (TOF) should be used. 
Views: non-attenuation corrected, attenuation-corrected and CT for attenuation correction. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
imaging to determine the presence or absence of metastatic disease in pre-prostatectomy patients 
with high risk prostate cancer (Cohort A). 
The secondary objectives were: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 18F-DCFPyL 
• To assess the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to determine the presence or 
absence of prostate cancer within sites of metastasis or local recurrence (Cohort B) 
• To determine detection rates of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and conventional imaging among lesion locations 
(e.g., bone, lymph nodes, soft tissue, prostate gland) 
• To determine PPV and NPV of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging 
• To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), biodistribution, and excretion of 18F-DCFPyL

Diagnostic performance characteristics of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging were evaluated using local 
histopathology as the truth standard. Three independent readers from a central imaging core lab were 
given access to 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging, conventional imaging, and imaging at biopsy. The central 
readers were all blinded to all other clinical information and histopathology assessments. Local 
pathologists who generated the histopathology results for the primary endpoint remained blinded to 
imaging results. 
The focus was on detection of PLN metastasis with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging in pre-prostatectomy 
patients with at least high-risk prostate cancer (Cohort A). Cohort B evaluated detection of disease 
recurrence and metastases with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging for comparison with existing radiographic 
evidence of disease by conventional imaging modalities.

(subset of Cohorts A and B combined). 
•  Sample size 
The planned total sample size for this study was 377 patients, including 262 patients in Cohort A and 
115 patients in Cohort B. This study was powered based on the primary analysis in Cohort A, which 
2 Detection Rates (DR) per patient (overall) or per region (location) is when a patient or region is defined as positive by a 
diagnostic procedure among the total of patients or regions analysed

tested the coprimary endpoints of sensitivity and specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging relative to 
histopathology for the Evaluable Set of patients in Cohort A with metastatic disease. For each 
coprimary endpoint, there were three independent imaging readers. At least two of the three readers 
had to reject the null hypothesis for specificity to be deemed a success. 
If specificity was a success, then the same two readers needed to reject the null hypothesis for 
sensitivity, leading to overall success of the co-primary endpoints. 
A total of 262 patients from Cohort A provided 80% power to reject the null hypothesis about 
sensitivity at the 5% significance level if the true sensitivity was at least 60% and at least 80% power 
to reject the null hypothesis about specificity at the 5% significance level if the true specificity was at 
least 87.8%. These calculations were based on the assumption that the probability of a positive 
histopathology sample in Cohort A is 20% and a 10% dropout or non evaluable rate in Cohort A. The 
sample size was based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution without a continuity 
correction. 
The type I error rate was preserved at 5% by requiring that both null hypotheses be rejected to draw 
the conclusion that 18F-DCFPyL was efficacious for imaging. The second primary endpoint was to be 
tested only if the first primary endpoint was rejected at the 0.05 level of significance per a fixed 
sequential method. If the first hypothesis failed to be rejected, no further testing was to be conducted. 
No formal power calculations were performed for Cohort B since it was not a primary endpoint. 
No interim analyses were performed. 
•  Randomisation  
This was an open-label, non-randomized study involving two cohorts of distinct patient populations. 
Patients were sequentially assigned to receive 18F-DCFPyL Injection in either Cohort A or Cohort B 
based on eligibility criteria and with competitive enrollment between study sites. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study, and all patients received 18F-DCFPy. 
Three independent readers from a central imaging core laboratory were given access to the 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT images for evaluation according to a one-reader paradigm, without being informed by 
either of the other two radiologists. One independent central reader was given access and evaluated 
the conventional imaging scans (including baseline conventional imaging and biopsy-images) for 
evaluation, without being informed by the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT results. All central readers were blinded 
to all other clinical information (including histopathology) and radiology assessments. 
Each Investigator was responsible for ensuring that local pathologists who generated the 
histopathology results for the primary endpoint remained blinded to all imaging results. 
•  Statistical methods 
Primary Efficacy: The primary analysis was to test the co-primary endpoints of sensitivity and 
specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging for the determination of PLN metastases relative to 
histopathology for the Evaluable Set in Cohort A. The evaluable subjects in Cohort A were those who 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 62/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were dosed, had a prostatectomy or lymphadenectomy, and provided a 18F-DCFPyL PET image result 
(positive or negative) and a corresponding histopathology result (positive or negative). 
The null hypotheses was tested in the following order: 
1. Specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT relative to histopathology in Cohort A (H0): 
πSp = 0.80 versus H1: πSp ≠ 0.80 
2. Sensitivity of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT relative to histopathology in Cohort A (H01): 
πSe = 0.40 versus H11: πSe ≠ 0.40 
where πSe was the true sensitivity and πSp was the true specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET imaging. 
The point estimates and 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation to the binomial 
were presented when the assumptions were met for this. These assumptions stated that the sample 
size was such that np>5 and n(1-p)>5, where n is the sample size and p is the binomial probability. If 
this assumption was not met, then an Agresti-Coull confidence interval was presented instead. The null 
hypothesis for specificity was rejected when the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded 80% for at least 
two of the three independent central PET/CT readers. When statistical significance was achieved for 
specificity where the null hypothesis was rejected, then sensitivity was tested where the null 
hypothesis would have been rejected when the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded 40% for the same 
two readers who rejected the null hypothesis for specificity.  
40% sensitivity and 80% specificity for null hypotheses were based on data reported in literature. 
The primary analysis in Cohort A tested the co-primary endpoints of sensitivity and specificity of 18F-
DCFPyL PET imaging relative to the presence or absence of PLN metastases at surgical pathology. For 
each co-primary endpoint, there were three independent 18F-DCFPyL imaging readers. At least two of 
the three readers had to reject the null hypothesis for specificity to be deemed a success. If specificity 
was a success, then the same two readers needed to reject the null hypothesis for sensitivity leading 
to overall success of the primary endpoint. The following statistics were computed: 
-Sensitivity = true positive (TP)/positive lobe or biopsy (R(p)), 
-Specificity = true negative (TN)/negative lobe or biopsy (R(n)), 
-PPV = TP/positive lesion (I(p)) 
-NPV = TN/negative lesion (I(n)) 
For Cohort A, a true positive or true negative value was determined based on imaging and 
histopathology aligning on outcome. The estimation of sensitivity and specificity was based upon 
findings from the independent readers at the central imaging core laboratory.  
The primary analysis for patients in Cohort A was addressed by computing point estimates and 2-sided 
95% CIs for specificity first. When the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded 80% for at least two of the 
three readers and the null hypothesis was rejected for specificity, then sensitivity was tested next. 
Specificity and sensitivity were computed for each of the three independent central readers. A 
sensitivity analysis of the co-primary endpoint was performed to allow any two of the three central 
PET/CT readers to reject the null hypothesis for sensitivity only after specificity had been deemed a 
success. Additional sensitivity analyses of the co-primary endpoint were performed post-hoc. 
Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints was conducted regardless of the outcomes of the primary 
analyses. Diagnostic testing and imaging detection rates were analyzed for the Evaluable Set. Point

estimates and 2-sided 95% CIs for PPV and NPV were computed for the prostate gland in Cohort A for 
the Evaluable Set. The normal approximation to the binomial distribution was planned when the 
assumption was met. Otherwise, the Agresti-Coull confidence interval was presented instead. PPV and 
NPV were computed for each of the three independent PET/CT readers at the central imaging core 
laboratory. 
Point estimates and 2-sided 95% CIs for PPV and sensitivity were computed from the conventional 
guided biopsy obtained from patients in Cohort B for the Evaluable Set. The normal approximation to 
the binomial distribution was planned where assumptions were met. In cases when assumptions were 
not met, CIs would be derived from the Agresti-Coull method. Results were computed for each of the 3 
independent readers from the central imaging core lab. The null hypothesis would be rejected if the 
lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded 0.5 for each of the three central readers. 
Safety analyses: Duration of safety follow-up was 7 (±3) days after 18F-DCFPyL dosing if surgery 
(Cohort A) or biopsy (Cohort B) had not occurred; and 21 (±7) days post biopsy (Cohort B). 
Definition of populations for analysis

Figure 6: Patient disposition and Primary Reason for Discontinuation from the Study
OSPREY cohort A enrolled a cohort of 268 men with high-risk biopsy-proven prostate cancer who were 
considered candidates for radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Each patient 
received a single piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT from mid-thigh to skull vertex. Three central independent 
readers blinded to all clinical information interpreted each PET scan for the presence of abnormal 
uptake in pelvic lymph nodes in multiple subregions, including the common iliac lymph nodes. 
A total of 252 patients (94%; cohort A evaluable set) underwent prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node 
dissection and had sufficient histopathology data for evaluation of the pelvic lymph nodes. Surgical 
specimens were separated into three regions: left hemipelvis, right hemipelvis, and other. For each 
patient, piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT results and histopathology results obtained from dissected pelvic 
lymph nodes were compared by surgical region. PET/CT results in locations that were not dissected 
were excluded from analysis. 
•  Recruitment 
The study period was approximately 20 months from the time the first patient was enrolled, 30 
November 2016, to the time the last patient underwent follow-up procedures, 19 July 2018. A total of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 65/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
462 patients were screened for participation in this study. Of these, 77 (16.7%) patients were screen 
failures. A total of 385 (83.3%) patients were enrolled and received study drug across 10 sites in the 
US (n=8) and Canada (n=2). At the end of the study, 350 (90.9%) patients had completed 
participation and 35 (9.1%) patients had withdrawn. The reasons for withdrawal from the study were 
Investigator decision (6.5%, n=25), withdrawal of consent (1.8%, n=7), or significant protocol 
violation or noncompliance (2.6%, n=3). 
•  Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was approved on 12 July 2016. There were two protocol amendments that were 
submitted to the appropriate Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) for information and approval in 
accordance with local requirements, and approval was obtained before any changes were 
implemented. No patient was enrolled prior to the implementation of Protocol Amendment 01. 
•  Baseline data 
-Demographics and PCa disease characteristics in Cohort A (safety set) 
Patients had a median age of 65 (range: 46 to 84) years. Patient characteristics of high-risk PCa 
included a total Gleason score ≥8 in 81% of patients, clinical T stage ≥T3a in 27% of patients and PSA 
>20 ng/mL in 18% of patients. The median PSA was 9.7 ng/mL (range 1.2-125.3 ng/mL). Almost all 
patients had no known disease in the regional lymph nodes (NX/N0, 97%) or distant metastasis 
(MX/M0, 99%) based on last AJCC staging (median 1.7 months prior to study entry). All patients were 
pre-prostatectomy, reflective of the target population. 
All Cohort A patients underwent baseline imaging with CT/MRI and whole-body bone scan. Based on 
central imaging evaluation by an independent, blinded central imaging reviewer, 61% of patients were 
N0 (n=164) and 82% of patients were M0. There were notably more suspicious metastatic findings by 
the central review than clinical staging by AJCC, owing to the known diagnostic performance limitations 
with CT/MRI. CT/MRI alone may misrepresent the extent of disease and is not reliable to determine 
pelvic nodal metastasis (~40% sensitivity coupled with low PPV [32% for CT and 47% for MRI]) 
(Hövels et al., 2008). 
For the 252 evaluable patients, the mean age was 64 years (range 46 to 84 years). The median serum 
PSA was 9.3 ng/mL. The total Gleason score was 7 for 19%, 8 for 46%, and 9 for 34% of the patients, 
with the remainder of the patients having Gleason scores of 6 or 10. 
-Demographics and PCa disease characteristics in Cohort B (safety set) 
Patients had a median age of 68 (range 45 to 86) years. PCa history and baseline disease 
characteristics demonstrate that Cohort B patients span the spectrum of recurrent disease, ranging 
from patients who were hormone naïve (38% with no prior ADT use) with low PSA levels (27% with 
PSA <2.0 ng/mL), to patients with M1 (37%) by AJCC staging. Notably, baseline conventional imaging 
staged 28% (n=33) of patients with M0 (no extra-pelvic metastases) radiographic disease state and 
70% (n=82) with a distant metastatic lesion (M1) at study entry. 
-Baseline Conventional Imaging (safety sets): 
All patients (safety set) had a baseline CT or MRI scan and a whole body bone scan as required per 
protocol. The majority (97.1%) of patients had contrast-enhanced CT and 99mTc-MDP bone scan 
(82.3%) at baseline. 
Prior Prostate Cancer Treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 66/139 
 
 
 
 
 
In Cohort A (safety set), no patients had prior prostatectomy. 264 (98.5%) of patients received no 
prior anticancer therapy. 
For Cohort B (safety set), as expected with the target population, the majority (63.2%) of patients 
received prior systemic prostate cancer therapy, with a median of 4 treatment regimens received 
(range 1 to 11). Forty-three (36.8%) patients did not receive any prior systemic prostate cancer 
therapy. A total of 47.0% received prior prostatectomy and 58.1% underwent prior prostate RT. 
•  Numbers analysed 
The number of patients included in each analysis set is reflected below: 
A total of 462 patients provided informed consent; 77 were screen failures and 385 patients were 
enrolled (268 in Cohort A and 117 in Cohort B) and received 18F-DCFPyL and underwent PET/CT 
imaging.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Osprey Study Cohort A 
Co-Primary Efficacy Results (Diagnostic performance for pelvic nodal metastases) 
Results for specificity reached significance, as the lower limit of the 95% CI of all 3 readers exceeded 
the success criteria of 80% confidence limit. Of the 190 (75.4%) men with no pathologic PLN lesion(s), 
specificity across all 3 independent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT readers was very high, ranging from 96.3% to 
98.9% (lower limit of the 95% CI: 93.6%-96.0%). 
Results for sensitivity did not reach significance, as the lower bound of the 95% CI (19.2% to 29.7%) 
for at least 2 of the 3 readers did not exceed the required success criteria of 40% confidence limit. 
Sixty-two (24.6%) men had at least one pathologic PLN lesion for prostate cancer metastases. 
Sensitivity across all three independent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT readers ranged from 30.6% to 41.9% 
(lower bound of 95% CI: 19.2%-29.7%). A summary of results is shown in the next table:

Osprey Study Cohorts A and B (Inter- and intra-reader variability) 
Inter- and intra-reader variability were assessed for the central imaging readers. When evaluating PLN 
lesions from the Cohort A Safety Set, Fleiss’ generalised kappa statistic showed a high level of 
agreement between readers at 0.78 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.71, 0.85). 
When the PLN reads were examined for Cohorts A and B combined, the kappa increased to 0.83. The 
inter-reader variability for the central readers by all biopsy images for Cohort B showed moderate 
agreement of 84.2%, with kappa statistic at 0.58 (95% CI 0.47, 0.70). Intra-reader variability for 
Cohort B images was not assessed. Intra-reader (test-retest) variability was assessed on a subset of 
images. For Cohort A (Safety Set), Cohen’s kappa was high at 0.70 for Reader 2 and showed perfect 
agreement (kappa=1.00) for Readers 1 and 3 for 19-21 images that were re-read when determining 
PLN metastasis. When combing the PLN re-reads for Cohorts A and B combined, Cohen’s kappa ranged 
from 0.79 to 1.00, which is a high to excellent rate of agreement in 29 images.  
Osprey Study Cohort A (Change in intended management) 
Changes to the clinical management plans were evaluated based on a prospective review of individual 
patient-level baseline clinical and conventional imaging data before and after 18F-DCFPyL PET by an 
independent central panel of disease experts using Medical Management Questionnaires completed 
before and after seeing 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT results. This review was performed on all Cohort A 
patients who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging (Cohort A Safety Set).  
Overall, the data showed that 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT led to a change in management in 43.6% (115/264) 
of patients with high risk prostate cancer based on both positive and negative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
scans. 
Sensitivity and PPV of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to Detect Prostate Cancer within Sites of 
Locoregional Recurrence or Metastasis (Cohort B) 
Sensitivity and PPV were 92.9-98.6% (95% CI, 84.0-100) and 81.2-87.8 (95% CI, 72.9-95.3) for the 
three readers respectively when all lesions were considered. There were also acceptable values of 
sensitivity and PPV by anatomic region (data not shown). 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Ancillary analyses in Osprey Study Cohort A 
Post-hoc Sensitivity Analysis Excluding Pathologic Lesions ≤5 mm in Metastatic Foci Size 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of the co-primary endpoint was performed in cohort A (Osprey study) 
excluding patients (n=27) who had pathologic PLN(s) with metastatic lesion size(s) below the PET 
detection limitation (≤5 mm) to account for the intrinsic detection limits of PET scanners for small 
lymph node metastases. 
The results of this analysis are shown in the following table. In this subset excluding men whose 
metastatic PLN lesions were below the PET scanner resolution (≤5 mm), 18FDCFPyL PET/CT 
demonstrated equally high specificity as in the primary analysis on the full Evaluable Set. Further, 
sensitivity met the success criteria whereby the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded 40% for the same 
two readers that rejected the null hypothesis for specificity. Additionally, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
demonstrated equally high PPV and NPV as in the primary analysis on the full Evaluable Set.

1Two-sided CI derived from a 1-sample binomial, where the null hypothesis was 0.8 for specificity and 0.4 for 
sensitivity. 
2Two-sided 95% CI derived from the Agresti-Coull method. 
Specificity was unchanged for all three readers from the primary efficacy results. Sensitivity across all 
three readers ranged from 27% to 37%, slightly lower than the primary efficacy results of 31% to 
42%. Notably, PPV and NPV remained unchanged relative to the pre-specified secondary endpoints, 
with PPV across all three readers ranging from 77% to 90% and NPV ranging from 81% to 83%. 
Post-hoc Comparison of Diagnostic Performance with Baseline Conventional Imaging in 
Patients with High Risk Prostate Cancer (Cohort A) 
When compared to centrally read conventional imaging (CT or MRI) for determining pelvic lymph node 
metastases in a post-hoc analysis, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT demonstrated a 3-fold higher PPV than 
conventional imaging (median 86.7% vs. 28.3%, respectively) despite similar sensitivity (median 
40.3% for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and 42.6% for conventional imaging). 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT was also 
more specific than conventional imaging (median 97.9% vs. 65.1%, respectively and had a slightly 
higher NPV than conventional imaging (median 83.2% vs. 78.8%, respectively). 
Exploratory analyses on the diagnostic performance of piflufolastat (18F) in OSPREY cohort 
A for detection of pelvic lymph node metastases, with region matching, stratified by tumor 
stage 
In exploratory analyses, there were numerical trends towards more true positive results among 
patients with total Gleason score of 8 or higher and among patients with tumor stage of T2c or higher 
relative to those patients with lower Gleason score or tumor stage (FDA, CDER Multi-discipline review, 
clinical review, Pylarify (piflufolastat (18F)), 2021).

Ancillary analyses in Osprey Study Cohort B 
Post-hoc Analysis of Sensitivity and PPV by Baseline PSA (Cohort B) 
Sensitivity and PPV values were high across all PSA ranges in men with suspected recurrent or 
metastatic prostate cancer. In men with low PSA values (<2 ng/mL), sensitivity ranged 88.9%-100% 
and PPV ranged from 62-89%. 
Staging Shifts from Baseline Conventional Imaging to 18F-DCFPyL PET Imaging 
In OSPREY Cohort B, 82 (70%) patients had baseline radiographic M1 stage disease (14 patients with 
M1a, 50 patients with M1b, 18 patients with M1c) by central conventional imaging review and 33 
(28%) patients were M0 stage at baseline by central conventional imaging review. 
18F-DCFPyL PET upstaged 58% (19/33) of patients from M0 to M1, of whom 91% (10/11) who 
underwent an extra-pelvic biopsy were confirmed to have M1 disease by pathology, including 9 
patients with M1b and 1 patient with M1a. 
Within M1 stage, 18F-DCFPyL PET upstaged 16% (10/64) of patients to a higher M1 sub-stage. 
Only one patient underwent biopsy of the upstaged lesion, which was confirmed positive by pathology 
(M1b). 
Of the patients who were staged M1 at baseline, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT down staged 22% (18/82) to M0, 
and 50% (6/12) who underwent an extrapelvic biopsy were confirmed to have no distant metastasis by 
pathology (M0). 
CONDOR STUDY (Diagnostic performance and Clinical Impact in BCR 
patients with non-informative baseline imaging) 
Methods 
This is a phase 3, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized study to evaluate the 
diagnostic performance and safety of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrence of 
prostate cancer and negative or equivocal findings per institutional standard of care conventional 
imaging.

Study participants 
 Men≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma per original diagnosis, 
with subsequent definitive therapy. All patients provided informed consent before any study 
procedures were performed. 
Eligible patients were enrolled in a non-randomized, sequential manner. Patient enrollment and follow-
up assessments concluded when the study reached the required number of patients evaluable for 
calculation of the primary endpoint. 
Patients who began any systemic therapy for prostate cancer prior to efficacy follow-up were 
discontinued from the study. 
Inclusion Criteria 
1. Men ≥18 years of age. 
2. Histopathologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma per original diagnosis, with subsequent 
definitive therapy. 
3. Suspected recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer based on rising PSA after definitive therapy 
on the basis of: 
a. Post-RP: Detectable or rising PSA that was ≥0.2 ng/mL with a confirmatory PSA ≥0.2 
ng/mL, American Urological Association (AUA) recommendation (Cookson et al. 2007); or 
 b. Post-RT, cryotherapy, or brachytherapy: Increase in PSA level that was elevated by ≥2 
ng/mL above the nadir, American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO)-
 Phoenix consensus definition) (Roach et al., 2006). 
4. Negative or equivocal findings for prostate cancer on conventional imaging performed as part of 
standard of care workup within 60 days prior to Day 1. 
5. Life expectancy ≥6 months as determined by the Investigator. 
6. Able and willing to provide informed consent and comply with protocol requirements. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria were not eligible for this study. 
1. Administered any high energy (>300 KeV) gamma-emitting radioisotope within 5 physical half-lives 
prior to Day 1. 
2. Ongoing treatment with any systemic therapy (e.g., ADT, antiandrogen, gonadotropin releasing 
hormone, GnRH, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, LHRH, agonist or antagonist) for prostate 
cancer. 
3. Treatment with ADT in the 3 months prior to Day 1. 
4. Receipt of investigational therapy for prostate cancer within 60 days prior to Day 1. 
5. Any medical condition or other circumstances that, in the opinion of the Investigator, compromises 
the safety or compliance of the patient to produce reliable data or to complete the study. 
Treatments 
18F-DCFPyL activity dose, method of administration and timing of scan are the same as the Osprey 
study.  
Assessment report

Enrolled patients received a single dose of 333 MBq 18F-DCFPyL injection followed by a single PET/CT 
scan acquired at 1-2 hours post-dosing. The median decay corrected dose at the time of administration 
was 340.4 MBq. Only patients with positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans (detection of disease at any 
site) by local assessment were followed at the Efficacy visit(s). Patients underwent Efficacy follow-up 
based on their 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT finding(s) per local interpretation and clinical presentation for 
evaluation of the composite truth standard, defined as evaluable local histopathology result for 
prostate cancer from surgery or biopsy performed within 60 days following 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT; or if 
evaluable histopathology was unavailable, informative conventional imaging finding(s) of the 
anatomical correlate to the 18F-DCFPyL-suspected lesion(s) within 60 days following 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT, before other treatment; or if neither histopathology nor conventional imaging was available or 
informative, confirmed PSA response post-radiation therapy [RT] (no concomitant androgen 
deprivation therapy [ADT]) that was initiated within 60 days following 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. 
Adverse events (AEs) were assessed following 18F-DCFPyL dosing (Day 1), and again via a safety 
phone call 7 (±3) days post-18F-DCFPyL dosing. 
Each 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan was assessed by 3 blinded radiologists who worked independently and 
did not receive any clinical information or other images for each patient. Each image obtained as part 
of the composite standard of truth was assessed by the (Imaging) Truth Panel, a distinct panel of 2 
independent readers who worked collaboratively. The Truth Panel provided consensus reads of the 
presence and location(s) of lesions consistent with prostate cancer on conventional imaging, and of the 
accuracy of targeting of 18F-DCFPyL lesions in imaging obtained during image-guided biopsy. 
Medical Management Questionnaires (MMQs) were to be completed by the treating investigator at two 
time-points during the study to capture planned changes in the clinical management for all subjects 
who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging: 
- Prior to 18F-DCFPyL dosing, the treating investigator will complete the Pre-PyL MMQ based on 
baseline clinical information and results from conventional imaging. 
- Post-18F-DCFPyL imaging, the treating investigator will complete the Post-PyL MMQ based on the 
additional result from local interpretation of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan, to assess whether a planned 
change to the initial medical management plan is warranted due to the 18F-DCFPyL finding. 
All concomitant medications and medical procedures were recorded in the eCRF from post 18F-DCFPyL 
dosing (Day 1) and at all subsequent study visits.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the Correct Localization Rate (CLR) of 18F-
DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in the detection of 
recurrent prostate cancer at the patient level. 
Secondary objectives: 
1. To assess the impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT disease detection on patient’s clinical management 
plans. 
2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 18F-DCFPyL. 
Exploratory objectives: 
1. To determine detection rates of disease sites with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT by region (prostatic, pelvic, 
extra-pelvic) and baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 74/139 
 
 
 
2. To determine the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging in the detection of 
recurrent disease in the prostatic, pelvic, and extra-pelvic regions.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The CLR at the patient level, defined as the percentage of patients for whom there was a one-to-one 
correspondence between localization of at least one lesion identified on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging 
and the composite truth standard. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The percentage of patients with a change in intended prostate cancer treatment plans due to 
18FDCFPyL PET/CT as measured by comparison of intended management questionnaires completed 
pre- and post-18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging results. 
Safety endpoints 
-Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events from time of 18F-DCFPyL dosing up to 7 (±3) days 
following 18F-DCFPyL dosing. 
-Change from baseline to post-18F-DCFPyL injection vital signs. 
-Concomitant medications and medical procedures. 
Exploratory endpoints 
-The detection rates of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT among lesion locations i.e., prostatic, pelvic, extrapelvic. 
-The PPV of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for prostatic, pelvic, extra-pelvic regions from the composite truth 
standard in patients with positive lesion(s) on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging. 
The percentage of patients with positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans who had negative findings for 
prostate cancer based on the composite truth standard. 
-The detection rates of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging as a function of baseline PSA groups. 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, the CLR. The assumed CLR of 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT imaging is 30%. Based on the varied published experience with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT 
and a meta-analysis (Perera et al., 2016), approximately 76% (95% confidence interval, CI: 66-85%) 
of PSMA scans are positive in patients with suspected recurrence of prostate cancer following initial 
therapy, conservatively 60% of subjets, and approximately 30% may be verified by the composite SoT 
(histopathology or conventional imaging or PSA follow-up post-RT). Then, the use of 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT will permit the detection/localization of recurrent prostate cancer in approximately 18% of the 
underlying target population, versus at most 5% that could be identified by conventional imaging 
alone. 
The sample size estimates are based on the positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of CLR to prevalence. 
The PLR is estimated as PLR=(CLR/1-CLR)/(prevalence/1-prevalence). 
Conservatively assuming the initial prevalence rate as a population parameter to be 5% by 
conventional imaging if a CLR of 30% is realized, the positive likelihood ratio is expected to be 8.1, 
implying a considerable increase in the clinical value of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to identify prostate cancer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 75/139 
 
 
 
Using a lower bound for the 95% CI for CLR of 20%, the corresponding lower bound for CLR would be 
4.75 based on a normal approximation to the Binomial. This will thus require a total of 81 positive 18F-
DCFPyL scans, which translates to a total of 134 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans or evaluable subjects 
needed. Accounting for a 30% non-evaluable (including loss to follow-up) rate, approximately 192 
subjects will need to undergo 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the study. 
Randomisation 
This was an open-label, non-randomized study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a single-arm, open-label study. All enrolled patients received 18F-DCFPyL. 
For local interpretation of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging, local readers were not blinded to clinical or 
other locally generated imaging results. If tissue was obtained, each Investigator was responsible for 
ensuring that local pathologists remained blinded to all locally generated imaging results. 
For primary endpoint analysis of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging evaluation by central readers, there was 
a central imaging core laboratory to provide blinded, independent imaging review services. This review 
was comprised of two discrete imaging evaluations: 
1. 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT assessment comprised of three blinded nuclear medicine readers (i.e., 
radiologists). The readers were blinded to all clinical information, including any other imaging available 
for a given patient. Each reviewer independently read 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT patient scans according to a 
one-reader paradigm, without being informed by either of the other two radiologists and without input 
from the Truth Panel, the local Investigator, or the Sponsor or designee. 
2. Truth Panel assessment was comprised of two distinct independent readers (i.e., not members of 
the blinded reader group). The Truth Panel readers were blinded to all data generated by the three 
blinded central 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT readers. The Truth Panel collaborated to provide a consensus read 
for each patient with correlative imaging and/or biopsy-guided imaging submitted by the local 
Investigator. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which includes patients who 
received any amount of 18F-DCFPyL and had 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging results from at least one 
central reader. 
The efficacy was assessed based on the primary endpoint of CLR, a measure of PPV at the patient level 
that employed anatomic lesion location matching, and a novel composite SOT using histopathology 
(preferred), correlative imaging, or PSA response to Radiotherapy (RT). 
The CLR was computed as TP/(TP+FP)×100% for each 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT central reader across all 
evaluable patients. The respective two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for each reader was 
computed using the binomial approximation to the normal distribution for each central reader. If the 
lower bound of the 95% CI was >0.2 for at least 2 of the 3 independent imaging reviewers, then the 
primary endpoint analysis was considered a success. 
A true positive (TP) result was defined as a patient with a positive lesion(s) on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
evaluated by at least one central reader and a positive result on the composite truth standard. One 
positive anatomical correlate on histopathology or follow-up imaging sufficed to declare the 18F-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 76/139 
 
 
 
DCFPyL PET/CT assessed by the central reader to be a TP. If a patient had more than one lesion 
identified by pathology or by correlative imaging, at least one lesion had to be successfully co-localised 
with the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT lesion for the patient to be considered a TP. A patient with a positive 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT scan who had the serum PSA response (decline from baseline of ≥50%) following RT as 
the standard of truth would also be categorized as TP.  
A false positive (FP) was defined as a patient with positive lesion(s) on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT from at 
least one central reader and with negative findings for prostate cancer according to the composite 
truth standard. 
A patient was considered unevaluable if the patient’s 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan was interpreted as 
positive by one or more of the central readers and no evaluable SOT data was available or the lesion 
location(s) identified on the truth standard did not match a positive lesion location identified by the 
central 18F-DCFPyL reader(s). 
If a patient had an 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan that the central reader(s) identified as negative, but the 
truth standard was positive, the patient was considered a false negative (FN). If a patient had an 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT scan that the central reader(s) identified as negative, and the truth standard was 
negative, the patient was considered a true negative (TN). 
Due to the entry criterion of noninformative standard of care baseline imaging, the majority (67%) of 
patients had low serum PSA concentrations (<2.0 ng/mL). As such, this BCR cohort of patients may 
have entered the trial with a lower pre-test probability of detecting disease compared to a general BCR 
population, demonstrating robust clinical benefit of the efficacy data obtained in CONDOR. Due to the 
design of the primary endpoint, only patients with locally assessed 18F-DCFPyL-positive lesions were 
followed for verification. As a consequence, sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were 
performed to account for missing and/or unevaluable SOT data. Multiple imputation and tipping point 
analyses, as well as re-assigning unevaluable records with centrally-read 18F-DCFPyL positive finding 
as false positives, all resulted in high CLRs, further supporting the robustness of 18F-DCFPyL PET in 
achieving the primary endpoint.  
As a sensitivity analysis, the analysis of the primary endpoint was repeated for patients in the per 
protocol (PP) population, the FAS excluding patients with major protocol violations. 
The primary endpoint was also analysed for patients who had positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT by local 
interpretation and using lesion locations recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Pattern mixture model-based multiple imputations (MI) assuming data are missing-at-random (MAR) 
and a tipping point analysis were performed as sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of the 
missing or unevaluable standard of truth assessments for patients who had 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT results 
by a central reader. The locations of lesions identified by the Truth Panel were imputed as the lesion 
locations in the multiple imputation scenarios. 
The primary endpoint was also calculated in subgroups: truth standard category; truth standard of 
each correlative imaging method; age; race; ethnicity; baseline PSA; historical initial therapy at study 
entry; baseline screening imaging modality; study center; size of the largest lesion detected on the 
18FDCFPyL PET/CT by the central readers; maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) reported on the 
18FDCFPyL PET/CT by the central readers; time of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT following dosing; time since 
discontinuation of ADT for patients with prior ADT. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint, change in planned medical management, was generated on the FAS 
and analyzed by calculating a two-sided 95% CI for the proportion of patients with any change in 
planned management as a binary variable. Shift tables were constructed for changes between no 
planned treatment and major categories of therapy, between major categories of therapy, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 77/139 
 
 
 
between categories of local therapy. Changes in planned therapy are also tabulated by the results 
reported by the central 18FDCFPyL PET/CT readers. 
The exploratory endpoint, detection rate, was defined as the percent of positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
scans identified by the central imaging readers: (the number of patients with positive scans / the 
number of patients with reported evaluable scan results) × 100%. Detection rates were calculated for 
anatomic regions, PSA values by category, and screening imaging modality. 
The exploratory endpoint, PPV, was calculated for patients with positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans as 
TP/(TP+FP) × 100%. PPV was calculated by anatomic region. 
The false positive rate was calculated as (the number of patients with scans defined as positive by the 
central imaging reader that were not confirmed by a truth standard) / (the number of patients with 
local positive scan results) × 100%. 
Detection rates, PPV, and false positive rates were analyzed using a two-sided 95% CI presented for 
each central imaging reviewer and for the local site interpretation separately based on a normal 
approximation to the binomial.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 217 patients provided informed consent to participate in the study but nine patients there 
were a screen failure. All the 208 patients who received any amount of 18F-DCFPyL (safety set) 
underwent PET/CT imaging and had an evaluable 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging result (FAS). Of the 208 
patients, 195 (93.8%) completed the study, and 13 (6.3%) discontinued. The reasons for 
discontinuation were protocol violation or noncompliance (6 patients), withdrawal by patient (5), 
Sponsor decision (1), and Investigator decision (1). No patients discontinued the study due to an AE.

Recruitment 
Patients were deemed enrolled once they signed the ICF, met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, 
and completed all screening assessments. The study duration of patient participation from screening 
through 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and Efficacy visit(s), if applicable, was a maximum of 
approximately 12 months. At a minimum, all patients who received a dose of 18F-DCFPyL were 
followed from the time of informed consent until the safety phone call on Day 8 (±3). The study was 
conducted from November 2018 to August 2019, with a first patient enrolled on 27 November 2018 
and a last patient enrolled 26 July 2019. The date of the last completed patient is 29 August 2019. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 31 July 2018, was not amended. 
Baseline data 
Demographics (safety set) 
The study population included men with a mean (SD) age of 67.9 (7.81) years; the majority (67.8%) 
were 65 years or older and the largest racial groups were white (90.4%) and black or African-American 
(7.2%); the majority were not Hispanic or Latino (94.2%).

At baseline, and based on last AJCC staging, regional lymph node metastasis was primarily NX or N0 
(183, 88%), and all patients had no known distant metastasis (100% with MX or M0). The median 
baseline PSA was 0.8 ng/mL (range, 0.2 to 98.5 ng/mL). 63% had non-informative whole body bone 
scan and CT/MRI/fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, 20% had CT or MRI only, 10% had 18F-fluciclovine or 
11C-choline PET (with or without other modalities), and 7% had whole body bone scan only. 
Prior Prostate Cancer Treatment 
Most patients (177, 85.1%) had prior RP and 105 (50.5%) patients had prior RT; 103 (49.5%) 
patients had prior RP only, 31 (14.9%) had prior RT only, and 74 (35.6%) had both RP and RT. 
Of the 105 patients who had received at least one prior course of RT for prostate cancer, 99.0% had 
RT to the prostate or prostate bed. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) was more common than 
brachytherapy. 
Fifty-eight (27.9%) patients had received at least one prior systemic therapy, mostly ADT. The most 
frequent prostate cancer medications taken prior to study entry included leuprorelin (40, 19.2%), 
bicalutamide (19, 9.1%), and degarelix (10, 4.8%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Results (CLR: correct localisation rate) 
The primary endpoint of CLR on the patient level met the pre-specified CLR success criterion whereby 
the lower limit of the 95% CI of the CLR exceeded 20% for at least two of the three independent, 
blinded central readers. 
Overall, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging detected at least one prostate cancer lesion in 59.1% to 65.9% 
(n=123 to 137) of patients by the three independent, blinded central readers. The CLR was 85% to 
87% and the lower limit of the 95% CI was 78% to 94% among the three readers (see table below).

CI=confidence interval; CLR=correct localisation rate for positive scans: FAS=Full Analysis Set; FP=false positive; 
SOT=standard of truth; TP=true positive. The FAS consisted of patients who received any amount of 18F-DCFPyL 
and had an 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT central imaging reader result.

218F-DCFPyL scans assessed by central readers and then compared to the SOT. 
3Unevaluable records were due to either an SOT not submitted for central review, or the SOT lesion evaluated did 
not match any positive 18F-DCFPyL lesion. 
CLR by Standard of Truth Method 
Histopathology: The CLR for the three readers for patients who had pathology as the SOT (n=31) 
was 79% (22/28), 83% (24/29), and 81% (21/26). 
Correlative Imaging: When correlative imaging was used as the SOT (n=100), CLR for Readers 1, 2 
and 3 was 88% (66/75), 89% (62/70), and 86% (62/72), respectively. 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT was 
the most commonly used method of correlative imaging in 71% of patients. Other modalities included 
MRI in 23% of patients, CT in 6%, and ultrasound and whole-body scan in 1% each. The CLR for the 
three readers as verified by 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT was 91% (50/55), 90% (45/50) and 87% (46/53), 
respectively. 
PSA response: For the only one patient who was evaluated by PSA response following RT, all three 
readers identified 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT positive lesion(s). The patient had a confirmed PSA reduction 
from 0.80 ng/mL to 0.06 ng/mL at 3 months post-RT, which was confirmed by a value of 0.07 ng/mL 
one week later. 
CLR by Baseline Imaging Modality 
CLR was consistently high for all patients grouped by negative baseline imaging modality: from 85.1% 
to 86.3% for patients who had whole body bone scan and CT/MRI/FDG PET (n=131), 76.2% to 78.9% 
for patients who had CT or MRI (n=42), 100% for those with negative 18F-fluciclovine or 11C-choline 
PET (n=20), and 100% for those with negative whole body bone scan only (n=15). 
Detection rates ranged from 58.8% to 66.4% for patients with negative whole body bone scan and 
CT/MRI/FDG PET (n=131), from 47.6% to 71.4% for patients with negative CT or MRI (n=42), from 
70.0% to 80.0% for patients who had negative 18F-fluciclovine or 11C-choline PET (n=20), and from 
26.7% to 40.0% for patients who only had negative whole body bone scan (n=15).

Secondary analysis (Change in Planned Medical Management) 
Treating physicians completed pre- and post-18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging clinical management 
questionnaires (MMQs) in a total of 207 of the 208 patients in the FAS (142 [69.3%] with positive 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT scans and 63 [30.7%] with negative scans, and 2 with unevaluable scans) based on 
local radiology interpretation. 
For the 207 patients with an MMQ completed at pre-and post-scanning, 63.9% (131/207) patients had 
a change in intended management after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Of the patients with changed clinical 
management plans, 78.6% (103/131) were based on positive PSMA PET/CT findings, and 21.4% 
(28/131) were based on negative findings. The most frequent changes were from salvage local therapy 
to systemic therapy (58 patients), from observation to initiating any therapy (49 patients), from 
noncurative systemic therapy to salvage local therapy (43 patients), and from planned treatment to 
observation (no treatment) (9 patients). 
Intra- and Inter-reader Agreement 
The concordance between the central readers, as well as between each central reader and the local 
reader, was assessed. Central readers were 76% (Fleiss’ kappa 0.65 [95% CI 0.58, 0.73]) in 
agreement with regard to the interpretation of positive or negative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans. The 
concordance between each central reader and the local reader ranged from 83% to 84%. The intra-
reader agreement testing resulted in almost perfect to perfect agreement (Cohen’s kappa coefficient 
≥0.81) in 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT positivity. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 82/139 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint (CLR) i.e., for the Per Protocol 
Population, by Local Interpretation of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans, with Unevaluable SOT analysed as FP 
(False Positive), CLR with lesion location recorded on the CRF and CLR from Multiple Imputation and 
Tipping Point Analyses. 
CLR with Multiple Imputation Methods 
Among the sensitivity analyses is included the multiple imputation and tipping point analyses of the 
CLR for patients with unevaluable SOTs. 
The maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the three central readers ranged from 86% to 98%. The 
CLR estimates and the corresponding 95% CIs from this analysis were consistent with the primary 
endpoint analysis results. The MLE estimates of CLR ranged from 76% to 80% for histopathology and 
from 95% to 97% for correlative imaging. The corresponding 95% CIs were consistently high for both 
histopathology and correlative imaging, similar to the analyses by SOT method. 
The results of the tipping point analysis showed that the estimates were lower as the delta values 
increased, but, for all delta values, the lower bounds of the 95% CI for PPV were above 20%.  
Subgroup analysis  
Detection rate and CLR by Baseline PSA 
Detection rate appeared to increase numerically with higher baseline PSA values based on the analysis 
subgroups and CLR was consistently high across baseline PSA ranges. In patients with baseline PSA 
0.2 to <2.0 ng/mL (n=137), 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT detected PCa in 34% to 73% of patients across the 
subgroups of 0.2 to <0.5 ng/mL (34% to 42%), 0.5 to <1.0 ng/mL (46% to 57%), and 1.0 to <2.0 
ng/mL (58% to 73%). 
In patients with PSA ≥2.0 ng/mL (n=63), detection rates ranged from 82% to 97% within the 
subgroups of 2 to <5 ng/mL (82% to 88%) and ≥5 ng/mL (90% to 97%). 
Within the subgroups, CLR was 73% to 85% in patients with PSA 0.2 to <2.0 ng/mL (n=137) and was 
91% to 97% in patients with PSA ≥2.0 ng/mL (n=66). 
Detection Rate and PPV by Anatomic Region 
Detection rate and PPV were calculated at the anatomic region level (prostatic, pelvic, and extrapelvic 
[ePLNs, bone, and visceral/soft tissue]) for the three independent readers. 
Detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for recurrent or metastatic PCa was distributed relatively evenly 
across the anatomic regions: 18% to 21% for prostatic lesions; 34% to 38% for pelvic lesions; and 
26% to 31% for extra-pelvic lesions.  
PPV was consistently high in all anatomic regions. In the prostatic region (prostate gland or prostate 
bed), PPV ranged from 75% to 83.3% among the three readers. In the pelvic region (N stage), PPV 
was 67.2% to 72.7% among the three readers. In the extra-pelvic region (M stage), PPV was also 
calculated by extent of metastatic disease: ePLNs, bone, and visceral/soft tissue. For ePLNs (M1a), PPV 
ranged from 60.9% to 65.2%; for bone metastasis (M1b), PPV ranged from 60.9% to 63.6%, and for 
the very small number of patients (n=6 to 9) with positive visceral/soft tissue lesions, PPV ranged from 
22.2% to 33.3% for visceral/soft tissue metastasis (M1c) based on the SOT, which were almost all 
correlative imaging. Only one patient had a histopathology of the visceral lesion as the SOT and was 
confirmed positive for PCa (TP).

To note: Exclusion criteria, 1 to 8 were included as these conditions or past treatments could interfere 
with the interpretation of PET/CT images. Exclusion criteria, 9 and 11 were included for safety reason. 
Treatments 
Each patient was planned to receive one single intravenous injection of 330 MBq of 18F-DCFPyL (300-
360 MBq) and one single intravenous injection of 18F-FCH at an activity of 2 to 4 MBq/kg body weight 
(140-280 MBq). The order of administration was randomised. A 10% variation in target activity was 
allowed. The median decay corrected dose at the time of administration was 321.19 (186.9-373.0) 
MBq.  
The activity of 18F-FCH was the recommended activity mentioned in the approved SmPC. The washout 
period between the two injections had to range between 24 hours and 12 days. 
Patients had not to be fasted before 18F-DCFPyL injection. Patients had to be fasted with no hydric 
restriction for four hours before 18F-FCH injection.  
PET/CT after administration of 18F-DCFPyL as an investigational medicinal product (IMP) and PET/CT 
after administration of 18F-FCH as a comparator were performed in all patients within a maximum time 
interval of 12 days. 
External independent coded and masked (blinded) interpretations of 18F-DCFPyl PET/CT and of 18F-
FCH PET/CT were performed by three independent masked and trained experts who were not 
otherwise involved in the trial. The order of presentation of PET/CT examination with IMP and with 
comparator was randomised, and a washout period of 2 weeks between the interpretations of two 
PET/CT examinations for a same patient was respected. 
As part of the routine care practice, these patients received appropriate treatment and follow-up. The 
investigating sites were therefore requested for the period of up to 10 months after the second tracer 
injection, to provide any results of subsequent biopsies, imaging studies, clinical findings, PSA 
measurements, and disease management if performed in routine practice. Treatment decisions were 
not standardised and made at the discretion of the referring physician based on all available clinical 
information, including local reports of both PET/CT scans and any other imaging findings.  
After completion of the study, a consensus was obtained from a multidisciplinary independent board 
(truth panel), based on the surrogate standard of reference which included all the above mentioned 
available results except PET/CT results from 18F-DCFPyL (IMP) and 18F-FCH (comparator). 
Assessments were made on a per-region and per-patient basis. The truth panel consisted in three 
independent experts (not otherwise involved in the trial). 
All above information was sequentially presented to the truth panel experts. The order of presentation 
of 18F-FCH PET/CT and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT results was randomised. The truth panel had to assess the 
impact of each PET/CT examination on disease restaging and change in treatment intent, by filling in a 
patient management questionnaire after review of each PET/CT examination report.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare per-patient detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus that of 
18F-FCH PET/CT (18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT). 
Secondary objectives were the assessment of:  
-The impact on patient treatment/management. 
-The per-region detection rates of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus those of 18F-FCH PET/CT. 
-The sensitivity and specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus those of 18F-FCH PET/CT on a per-patient 
and per-region basis, using a composite SOR. 
-The concordance rates between 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT for regions using a 
composite standard of references (SOR). 
-The safety of 18F-DCFPyL versus that of 18F-FCH. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Comparison of the per-patient detection rate for 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FCH PET/CT.

PET/CT. 
-Safety endpoints: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 24 h after injection and SAEs 
during the 10-month follow-up. Change from baseline in clinical laboratory values, and vital signs. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy variable is the per-patient detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus that of 
18F-FCH PET/CT. 
A review of the available literature on the detection rates for both tracers has been performed. A meta-
analysis of Von Eyben et al including 12 publications on the detection rate of 18F-FCH PET/CTreports 
an overall detection rate of 66.4% (656/987 patients) (Von Eyben et al., 2016). Cimitan M et al report 
a positive rate of 64.5% in 1,000 patients, who received F-Choline PET/CT in the context of 
biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, and were retrospectively analysed (Cimitan et al., 2015]. 
Gillebert et al report a detection rate of 59% in the French prospective study ICHOROPRO (Gillebert et 
al., 2018).

Three publications report the detection rate of 18F-DCF-PyL PET/CT. The first publication reports a 
detection rate of 84.6% (110/130 patients) (Rousseau et al., 2019) and the second publication reports 
a detection rate of 86.3% (214/248 patients) (Wondergem et al., 2019], and the third publication 
reports a detection rate of 74.2% (46/62 patients) (Dietlein et al., 2017). 
The sample size was computed using SAS (Proc Power with the paired freq statement and the 
Miettinen method) with the following hypothesis: 
-Two-tailed risk 1 error (α) = 0.05 
-Power (1-β) = 0.9 
-Correlation between measure 1 and measure 2 = 0.5 
-Detection rate with 18F-Fluorocholine = 0.66 
-Detection rate with 18F-DCFPyL = +12% with respect to the reference rate. A difference of+12% 
between the 18F-FCH and the 18F-DCFPyL being assessed as the minimal clinically expected 
improvement with respect to results published in the literature (Rousseau et al., 2019).

With detection rates of 66% and 78% expected with 18F-Fluorocholine and 18F-DCFPyL respectively, 
141 patients will have to be randomised to show a statistical significant difference at the two-sided 5% 
level with a statistical power of 0.9. 
Assuming that 35% of randomised patients will not be assessable, 217 will have to be included. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment sequence 18F-FCH PET/CT 
followed by 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT or 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT followed by 18F-FCH PET/CT. 
The randomisation was stratified on the type of the previous therapy (radical prostatectomy +/- eLND 
/ curative radiation therapy) and done centrally using an interactive web response system (IWRS). 
Blinding 
There was no blinding for the administered study drug, as this study is open-labelled. 
PET/CT images-Independent blinded readers 
An external, coded, masked, and independent interpretation of the 18F-FCH PET/CT and 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT images were performed. Three independent masked and trained readers not otherwise 
involved in the trial interpreted each PET/CT scans. The order of images presentation was randomised, 
and a washout period of 4 weeks between the two PET/CT scans for the same patient will be 
respected. Readers who do not have any knowledge of the following independently evaluated the 
images of 18F-DCFPyL PET /CT and 18F-FCH PET /CT: patient specific information (history, physical

examination, results of other imaging studies), final diagnosis, treatments, patient outcome and 
medicinal product used to obtain a given image. Each reader was masked to the interpretations of the 
other readers. 
Patients’ first and second scans were separated into two batches. Each batch had to be analysed within 
a period of four weeks and a washout period of at least four weeks was mandatory between the two 
batches. 18F-FCH and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT were separated into different clusters inside a batch. One 
cluster corresponded to all 18F-FCH cases and the second cluster to all 18F-DCFPyL cases. Indeed, 
18F-FCH and 18F-DCFPyL have a different biodistribution and the interpretation criteria are also 
different. Therefore, the radiotracer could not strictly blinded. Moreover, it was easier for the readers 
that they could focus on applying consistent analysis for the whole cluster at a time, instead of 
presenting 18F-FCH and 18F-DCFPyL in a completely randomised sequence. Reader saw both the 
attenuation-corrected and non-attenuation-corrected PET images at the same time, as well as all the 
CT images. All the 18F-FCH acquisition sets were presented at the same time. Readers were blinded to 
all patients’ data. Readers were not allowed to see previous assessments. In addition, 10 % of the 
cases were repeated for the assessment of intra-individual variability. These cases were added into the 
second batch in a randomised order. 
Truth panel 
After completion of the study, a consensus was obtained from a multidisciplinary independent board 
(truth panel) on SOR determination and impact on management. There was two sequential Truth Panel 
sessions with a washout period of two weeks between the sessions. The first session was aim at SOR 
determination for each patient. The second session was aim at determination of the impact of the 
imaging on diagnostic thinking and patient management. The order of presentation of the PET/CT 
results was randomized. 
The truth panel, composed of 3 independent experts (who were neither involved in the study nor in the 
blinded read sessions) including one board certified urologist, one board certified nuclear medicine 
physician, and one board certified oncologist was blinded to PET/CT results for SOR determination. For 
the assessment of the impact on patient management, they had sequential unblinding access to the 
baseline data, treatment period tracer 1 data, treatment period tracer 2 data, and finally to all follow-
up data. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary efficacy variable was the per-patient detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus 18F-
FCH PET/CT for recurrence (either local, regional or distant), based on the independent central 
reading. The detection rate was defined as the ratio between the number of patients defined as 
positive at patient level by at least 2 independent readers, and the total number of assessed patients. 
The per-patient detection rate was defined as follows; 
[a] For readings made twice by a same reader (for analysis of variability intra-reader), only the first 
readers’ review was considered 
[b] Patients with imputed result were considered as assessed Per-patient detection rates and 
associated two-sided 95%CI were computed for 18FDCFPyL PET/CT and for 18F-FCH PET/CT.

The Prescott’s test was used to assess the difference between the two methods in term of detection. 
Blinded evaluation of images 
Twelve regions were assessed but only the five following regions were to be described in the results: 
(T) Prostate bed 
(N) Pelvic lymph node(s) 
(M1a) Extra pelvic lymph node(s) 
(M1b) Bone 
(M1c) Other organ(s) 
PET/CT scans were considered positive: 
-On a patient basis, if at least one region was rated positive for the patient 
-On a region basis, if at least one lesion was positive for the respective region 
Every anatomic field were rated on a Likert 5-point-scale using the following criteria: 1, tumour 
manifestation; 2, probably tumour manifestation; 3, equivocal; 4, probably benign; and 5, benign. 
Within-reader variability and Inter-reader reproducibility was investigated as described above 
(Blinding section). In order to reduce inter-reader variability, the readers were trained and allocated to 
evaluate the same set of images as part of the development plan. 
The variability intra-reader was analysed overall and for each reader with the Cohen’s kappa. The 
variability inter-reader was analysed overall and for each tracer with the Fleiss’ kappa. 
The SOR was made of an appropriate combination of tests available at baseline and performed in 
clinical routine practice up to 10 months after the last 18F-tracer injection including as described as 
follows. 
Ideally, every lesion detected on imaging should be confirmed by anatomopathological validation. 
However, histopathology is often lacking (because the location of the lesions is deep within the pelvis 
and consequently difficult to sample, or the number of lesions is too high and it is not feasible to 
sample them all individually, or if there are ethical issues regarding the need to perform biopsies for 
research purposes only, or if there are ethical issues to perform invasive biopsies when the local 
recurrence is obvious based on imaging). Sometimes, biopsy also fails to depict some tumours (false 
negative rate). 
Moreover, patients previously treated with curative surgery presenting with BCR and with negative 
imaging may be treated with radiation therapy to the prostate bed and/or pelvic LN even without 
histological proof of local recurrence. Therefore, a consensus was obtained from a multidisciplinary 
independent board (truth panel), on a surrogate standard of reference (SOR) based on all available 
data from baseline up to 10-month follow-up performed at the discretion of the physician in regular 
clinical care practice except PET/CT results. Moreover, the truth panel committee also assessed the 
impact of each local PET/CT result on disease and patient management.

RESULTS 
Participant flow 
Overall, 217 patients were included. Among them, 205 (94.5%) patients were included in the FAS. The 
12 (5.5%) patients who were not included in the FAS correspond to two patients considered as screen-
failure and 10 patients who did not receive any tracer.

Recruitment 
The study period lasted from July 2020 until December 2020. The inclusion date of the first patient 
(first patient first visit, FPFV) was 1 July 2020, and the inclusion date of the last patient (last patient 
last visit, LPFV) was 4 December 2020 with a Last date of 24h-safety follow-up visit/call after the 
treatment period tracer 2 on 17 December 2020. The last Truth Panel session occurred on 8 January 
2022.  
Conduct of the study 
The initial approved protocol version was different in each country based on exchanges with competent 
authorities and ethics committees.  A first version (v1.0 of 21 January 2020) was approved and 
implemented in Spain. A protocol version 2.1 dated 14 May 2020 was approved and implemented in 
Belgium (with addition of ‘Treatment with colchicine in the past 8 days or ongoing’ as exclusion 
criteria, inclusion of PSA kinetics in the subgroup analysis, extension of recruitment period, 
contraception requirements). Protocol v2.2. dated 4 June 2020 was approved and implemented in 
France (with change of the name of the sponsor and sites of manufacturing as Curium PET France) 
followed by a protocol v3.0. dated 4 June 2020 (with some clarifications). Protocol v3.0 dated 15 June 
2020 was approved and implemented in Spain (with addition of 2 exclusion criteria respectively 
‘treatment with colchicine in the past 8 days or ongoing’ and ‘treatment with hematopoietic colony 
stimulating factors (CSF) in the past 5 days or ongoing’; some clarifications and harmonization with 
protocols versions implemented in others MSs). Protocol v3.1 dated 15 June 2020 and protocol v3.2 
dated 27 July 2020 were authorized and implemented respectively in Belgium and in the Netherlands 
to harmonize with protocols versions implemented in others MSs. Protocol v3.3 dated 31 August 2020 
was approved and implemented in The Netherlands to add clarification about early termination of the 
study. Finally, Protocol v4.0 dated 03 March 2021, Protocol v4.1 dated 03 March 2021, and Protocol 
v4.2 dated 03 March 2021 were authorized and implemented in France and Spain, in Belgium and in 
the The Netherlands respectively, to extend the follow-up period of the patients from 7 to 10 months. 
Baseline data (FAS) 
-Patient demographics are presented as follows: 
Patients had a median age of 71 (range: 53 to 88) years. The majority were 65 years or older (76.1% 
in overall FAS population and 77.5% and 74.8% in patients having received first 18F-FCH or 18F-
DCFPyL, respectively). The median body mass index (BMI, kg/m²) was 27.39 in the overall population 
(and similar in both groups 27.85 and 26.84 for patients having received first 18F-FCH or 18F-DCFPyL, 
respectively). None of the patient presented a BMI<18.5 kg/m². Most of the patients (92.2% 
[n=189/205]) presented a Grade 0 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-
PS): 96.1% (n=98/102) for patients receiving 18F-FCH first and 88.3% (n=91/103) for patients 
receiving 18F-DCFPyL first. Few patients (6.8% [n=14/205]) presented a Grade 1 ECOGPS: 3.9% 
(n=4/102) for patients receiving 18F-FCH first, and 9.7% (n=10/103) for patients receiving 18F-
DCFPyL first. The two remaining patients presented a Grade 2 ECOG-PS and were included in the 
group of patients having received 18F-DCFPyL as first tracer. 
PCa history is summarised as follows:  
The median time since initial PCa diagnosis was 45.57 months in both groups, ranging from 2.5 to 
207.7 months for patients receiving 18F-FCHfirst and from 5.1 to 214.1 months for patients receiving 
18F-DCFPyL first. ISUP grade was available for 204 patients (only one missing value in the group of 
patients receiving 18F-FCH as first tracer). Most of the patients (81.3%) presented with an ISUP grade 
Assessment report

from 0-3: Grade 1 was reported for 46 (22.5%), Grade 2 for 74 (36.3%) and Grade 3 for 46 (22.5%). 
The remaining 18.7%presented with higher ISUP grades: Grade 4 was reported for 23 (11.3%) and 
Grade 5 for15 (7.4%). D’Amico risk class was available for 204 patients (only one missing value in the 
group of patients receiving 18F-FCH first). Among them high risk was reported for 79 (38.7%) 
patients, intermediate risk for 44 (21.6%) patients, and low risk for 25 (12.3%) patients. In addition, 
D’Amico risk class assessment was not applicable for 56 (27.5%). It corresponds to patients for whom 
D’Amico risk class was not assessable mainly because of “T” classification of the tumour that was of 3 
or over. Regarding tumour, nodes and metastases stage at the time of initial diagnosis of PCa disease, 
patients were mainly presenting with T2 tumours (121, 60.2%). T3 primary tumour stage was 
reported in 55 patients (27.4%). Only one patient included in the group having received 18F-DCFPyL 
as first tracer was presenting with a T4 stage primary tumour. Most patients presented with N0: 124 
patients (61.7%). N stage was unknown (Nx) for 66 patients (32.8%). Metastatic status was available 
for 201 patients. All of them were classified with a M0 disease. 
PCa Characteristics at Baseline 
The patients were mainly treated with curative intent by RP±eLND (73.2%, n=150/205) and the 
remaining 26.8% (n=55/205) patients were initially treated with RT. PSA level at first injection was 
available for 185 patients (90.2%). Among them for patients who were treated initially with RP±eLND: 
6 patients (4.4%) with PSA level 2 ng/mL, 71 patients (52.6%) with PSA level ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 
ng/mL, 31 patients (23.0%) with PSA level ranging from 0.51 to 1 ng/mL, 18 patients (13.3%) with 
PSA level ranging from 1.01 to 2 ng/mL and two patients (6.7%) with PSA level >2 ng/mL. These two 
patients correspond to the two patients who were randomised in the wrong stratum according to 
previous initial treatment with curative intent. For patients who were treated initially with RT: one 
patient (2.0%) with PSA level ≤2 ng/mL and 49 patients (98.0%) with PSA level >2 ng/mL. The 
overall mean time between first abnormal PSA and first PET/CT was of 5.26 months. The mean PSA 
doubling time (PSAdt) was of 10.80 months. In addition, most of the patients presented with a PSAdt 
over 6 months was 57.6% (n=102/177). The mean PSA velocity was of 5.45 ng/mL/year. 
Prior Systemic Prostate Cancer treatments: Regarding hormonotherapy, 27 patients were treated with 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Mean treatment duration was of 13.08 [0.0-42.5] months. In 
addition, three patients, respectively, were treated with another hormonotherapy (no precision was 
recorded). 
Numbers analysed 
217 patients were screened and included, 215 patients were randomized. 205 patients received one 
tracer (18F DCFPyL or 18F-FCH) and 201 patients received both tracers. The FAS (ITT) includes 
therefore 205 patients (having received at least one injection of either study product, regardless of any 
protocol deviations). The safety analysis set is confounded with the FAS (205 patients). The PP 
includes 195 patients (all patients from the FAS population without any major protocol deviation and 
who received the required doses of 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FCH). 
Outcomes and estimation 
PYTHON was a randomised, open-label, two-treatment cross-over study. It enrolled 217 male patients 
with first biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, who underwent definitive therapy (radical 
prostatectomy (RP) ± extented lymph node dissection (eLND) in 73.2% patients, EBRT or 
brachytherapy in 26.8% patients). 
Primary endpoint results 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 92/139 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was detection rate (DR) defined as number of patients defined as positive at 
patient level by the independent readers among the total number of patients assessed (for piflufolastat 
(18F) PET/CT and fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT). A significant difference of 12% detection rate in favour 
of piflufolastat (18F) against Fluorocholine (18F) was pre-defined. 
Per-Patient Detection rate (DR) 
Overall, per-patient detection rate is summarised in the following table. 
Table 26: Per-Patient Detection Rate 
CI=confidence interval. Worst case imputation: missing or indeterminate results were imputed to ’Negative’. Best 
case imputation: missing or indeterminate results were imputed to ’Positive’. Observed case: missing or 
indeterminate results were not imputed. As the Prescott’s test is only applicable for patients who completed the 
entire treatment sequence (and in this analyse no imputation is performed), patients with only one injection were 
not taken into account. [a] P-value issued from Prescott’s test.  
Detection rate in different subgroups. 
Overall, when considering the detection rate in the different subgroups in the observed case, the 
performance of detection of the 18F-DCFPyL over the 18F-FCH seemed to be apparently higher for all 
subgroups (PSA level, PSAdt, D’Amico risk and ISUP grade). 
Two-hundred one patients performed one piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT and one fluorocholine (18F) 
PET/CT from mid-thigh to skull vertex in a randomised order. Three independent central readers, 
blinded to all clinical information, evaluated each piflufolastat (18F) and each fluorocholine (18F) 
PET/CT for the presence and location of positive lesions. Location of each lesion was categorized into 5 
regions (prostate/prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, other lymph nodes, bone, soft tissue). Recurrence 
was detected by the blind read experts in 119 (60.4%) and 82 (41.0%) of the patients with 
piflufolastat (18F) and fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT, respectively. Details of overall independent reader’s 
interpretation by PSA level is given in Table 30.

Secondary endpoint results 
Secondary endpoints were sensitivity (ratio between the number of patients defined as positive for a 
given region by the independent readers and the total number of patients assessed as positive for a 
given region by the truth panel), concordance (ratio between the number of regions defined as positive 
by both piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT and Fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT + the number of regions defined as 
negative by both piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT and Fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT and the total number of 
assessed regions) and impact on patient management. 
Per-Region Detection rate Overall 
Overall, the detection performance of 18F-DCFPyL was better than the performance of 18F-FCH in the 
prostate bed, bones and other organs. Otherwise, 18F-DCFPyL did not seem to perform better than 
18F-FCH in disease detection in the pelvic and ePLNs. 
Table 28: Per-Region Detection rate Overall 
CI=confidence interval; ePLN=extra-pelvic lymph node; PLN=pelvic lymph node. 
Per-patient sensitivity and specificity: 
Per-patient sensitivity was assessed for 37 patients with a standard of truth and is reported in Table 
32. Per-patient sensitivity of (18F)-piflufolastat was significantly higher than that of (18F)-fluorocholine 
(p<0.0001).

Specificity was considered as not assessable as all patients were assessed as “positive” (i.e., 
recurrence detected in all patients) by the truth panel experts. 
Concordance rate: 
The concordance rate between 18F-piflufolastat PET/CT and 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT according to 
central blind readers, per-region was remarkably high for all regions of interest, namely prostate bed: 
87.3% (81.9; 91.3), pelvic lymph nodes: 73.9% (67.3; 79.5), extrapelvic lymph nodes: 86.5% (81.0; 
90.6), bones: 86.9% (81.5;91.0), and other organs: 92.0% (87.3; 95.1). 
Discordance between 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FCH were analysed per-region using the SOR when 
available. Overall, according to the Truth Panel experts the results obtained with 18F-DCFPyL were 
considered as true in 65% of the cases (26/40). When considering each region independently, results 
obtained with 18F-DCFPyL were considered as true (positive or negative) by the Truth Panel experts: 
-For the prostate bed, in 6/7 cases (85.7%) 
-For the lymph nodes, in 8/11 cases (72.7%) 
-For the ePLNs, in 100% of the cases (5/5) 
-For the bones, in 7/15 (46.7%) 
-For other organs, in 0/3 (0%) 
Impact on Diagnostic Thinking and Patient Management: 
Overall, the Truth Panel considered that patients were mainly presenting with local disease (n=131, 
63.9%). Forty patients (40) (19.5%) presented a regional extension and 34 patients (16.6%) 
presented distant metastases. 
The impact on patient management was assessed by the Truth Panel in two different ways. 
First, the truth panel determined management based on baseline data and without knowing the results 
of the PET/CTs. Then they proposed a patient management after reviewing the results of each of the 
individual PET/CTs (PET/CT being proposed blindly). The truth panel followed a process of evaluation in 
different subsequent steps. The percentage of changes between the proposed management at baseline 
and the proposed management after each PET/CT, in this case, represents the impact of each of the 
PET/CTs images on patient management according to the truth panel management plans. The truth 
panel proposed to modify treatment intent in 26.0% (n=53/204) and 21.3% (n=43/202) for 18F-
DCFPyL and 18F-FCH, respectively. 
In a second approach, the truth panel determined management based on baseline data and without 
knowing the results of the PET/CTs and compared it with the treatment implemented locally by the 
Investigator who considered the common information of the two PET/CTs since the Investigator was 
aware of the results of both PET/CTs at the time of the choice of management. The calculated impact is 
the result of the combination of the two PET/CTs. The truth panel then retrospectively identified the 
PET/CT examination that had been the most informative at the time of the therapeutic decision locally. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 95/139 
 
 
 
 
According to the truth panel, the patient management proposed by local team was impacted by the 
PET/CTs in 48.8% of the cases (100/205 patients), as follows: 
• Impact of the 18F-DCFPyL in 44.1% (90/204)  
• Impact of 18F-FCH in 28.7% (58/202) 
Detection Rate Intra-Reader Variability and Inter-Reader Variability 
When considering per-patient detection rate by reader only considering the observed cases Readers 1 
and 3 reported a 64.2% and 66.7% positive detection rate for 18F-DCFPyL when Reader 2 only 
reported a 55.2% positive detection rate. All the readers were consistent when considering positive 
detection rate for 18F-FCH ranging from 41.3% to 44.3%. 
The overall percentage of agreement was of 76.7% with a Cohen’s Kappa (95% CI) of 0.54 (0.39; 
0.68). These low values of percentage of agreement and of Cohen’s Kappa (95% CI) was due to 
Reader 3. Indeed, this reader reported a 67.5% percentage of agreement and only a Cohen’s Kappa 
(95% CI) of 0.33 (0.05; 0.62). On the contrary, Reader 1 and 2 obtained a percentage of agreement 
≥80% (82.5% and 80.0%, respectively) with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.64 (0.40; 0.88) and 0.62 (0.39; 
0.84) considered to be substantial according to Landis and Koch classification (Landis et al., 1977). 
The inter-reader percentage of agreement was of 67.8% and 65.4% for 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FCH, 
respectively. The corresponding Fleiss’ kappa was of 0.55 (0.47; 0.63) and 0.54 (0.45; 0.63), 
respectively, indicating a moderate agreement between readers according to Landis and Koch 
classification (Landis et al., 1977). 
Efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL from the literature 
The applicant carried out a literature search in 3 databases: PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane, from 
December 2011 to May 2022. Database lock point: 27th May 2022.  
“18F-DCFPyL” or “[18F]DCFPyL” or “DCFPyL” or “piflufolastat F-18” or “piflufolastat (18F)” in all fields: 
Title, abstracts, keywords. The searches resulted in 248 hits.  
Each publication was evaluated for relevance based on the title, the abstract or, if still uncertain, on 
the complete article. More than 100 relevant publications on 18F-DCFPyL were included in the clinical 
overview, among them 36 studies on efficacy performed in a series of patients.  
The applicant presented data from literature on efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL in localisation of primary PCa. 
These data were not taken into account, as this indication is not claimed in the submitted dossier.  
Only the following four studies were submitted for initial staging.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
There were no dedicated clinical studies by gender and in children submitted as this medicinal product 
is only intended for adult men.  
Moreover, no dedicated studies in patients with renal or hepatic impairment were submitted. Out of 
total 385 patients in OSPREY, 245 had mild kidney insufficiency, 29 had moderate kidney insufficiency 
and 1 had severe kidney insufficiency (See 2.6.2.1. ).  
Regarding the age, the demographics by indication in the 3 main sponsored studies are shown as 
follows. 
1. Initial staging: In Cohort A the demographics by age at informed consent in years were: 
Mean age (SD): 64.0 (6.7), Median (Min, Max): 65 (46, 84), Age <65 years, n (%): 132 (49.3) and 
Age >65 years, n (%): 136 (50.7). 
2.- Demographics for recurrent or metastatic PCa is shown in the following table. 
Table 34. Demographics, Recurrent or Metastatic PCa 
Max=maximum; Min=minimum; ND=not done; PCa=prostate cancer; SD=standard deviation. 1All patients were 
men. Percentages are based on the Safety Set for each study, which includes all patients who received any amount 
of 18F-DCFPyL. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The claimed indications are 1) initial staging of prostate cancer in patients at risk of metastases who 
are candidates for definitive therapy, and 2) for localisation of recurrence in case of rising serum PSA 
levels after treatment. 
The applicant has submitted clinical data from three studies to demonstrate efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT for diagnostic use in patients with PCa (Osprey, Condor and Python studies). Additionally, the 
applicant has submitted data from literature to support the efficacy claims. Data from literature and its 
content is acceptable for this submission.  
Overall, the applicant has followed the requirements stated out in the guideline on clinical evaluation of 
diagnostic agents (Doc. Ref. CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev. 1) and the appendix 1, to address the main 
topics assessing the benefits of diagnostic agents. Mainly, technical performance, diagnostic 
performance and the impact on patient management have been addressed.  
The recommended method for PET images interpretation with piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT is the visual 
interpretation.  
The PET acquisition is performed from mid-thigh through the vertex of the skull, starting 90 to 120 
minutes after tracer injection. It must include lower extremities if there is known or suspected disease. 
Image acquisition duration is 12 to 40 minutes depending on the type of PET cameras, number of bed 
positions (typically 6 to 8) and acquisition time per bed position (typically 2 minutes to 5 minutes). If 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023

the acquisition leads to indeterminate findings, and provided a sufficient activity remains for adequate 
counting statistics, late acquisitions can also be performed, thus reducing background activity (see 
SmPC section 4.2).  
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void before the 
examination in order to reduce bladder activity and as often as possible during the first hours after the 
examination in order to reduce radiation exposure. Systematic use of diuretics is not recommended but 
may be useful in certain situations to improve quality imaging. A diuretic expected to act within the 
uptake time period may be administered to improve interpretation of piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT as it 
results in less activity depositions in ureters and the bladder (see SmPC section 4.4). Low-dose CT has 
been utilized in the clinical studies for anatomic correlation and attenuation correction. This is correct 
to not jeopardize the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET. No MRI has been used in the 
submitted clinical trials, therefore, it is not recommended in SmPC.  
Lesions should be considered suspicious if uptake is greater than physiologic uptake in that tissue or 
greater than adjacent background if no physiologic uptake is expected. 
The performance of piflufolastat (18F) for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence 
of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels (see SmPC section 4.4. and 5.1). The 
performance of piflufolastat (18F) for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive 
therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score. To date no outcome data exist to 
support subsequent management of patients based on PSMA-PET in the primary staging. Therefore, 
treatment should not be changed based on piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT findings only. 
Piflufolastat (18F) has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and has only been studied 
in patients with mild renal impairment. No adaptation for administered activity and time for image 
acquisition is considered necessary in moderate or severe renal insufficiency. However, careful 
consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation exposure is 
possible in these patients with severe impaired renal function (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Dose response studies    
No formal dose-response study has been submitted with this application. 
The selection of the dose and optimal imaging timepoint have been based on several pillars, such as 
radiation dose optimization (ALARA (As Low As is Reasonably Achievable) principle), image quality and 
current 18F-FDG dose recommendations (Szabo et al., 2015). A high-quality PET image is one in which 
the proportion of true counts is maximized while minimizing noise. This value is commonly referred to 
as the Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR). Moreover, there is extensive experience from the majority 
of the published studies in patients with PCa and recommendations from the EANM standardised 
reporting guideline for PSMA-PET (Ceci et al., 2017). The approach for dose finding is acceptable. The 
applicant has proposed the dose by BW to be aligned with the majority of diagnostic 
radiopharmaceuticals. Across clinical development the dose of 333 MBq (single IV dose) was selected 
to be in line with both the ALARA principle and current 18F-FDG dose recommendations (Szabo et al., 
2015). A further analysis was made across all 3 pivotal studies (PYTHON, OSPREY, CONDOR) showing 
that the mean injected activity per kilogram of body weight and the median activity were quite 
homogeneous across the 3 studies: mean activity of 3.87 MBq/kg. In accordance with the EMA 
guideline on core SmPC and package leaflet for radiopharmaceuticals (2011) which recommends a 
suggested activity range based on a patient of average weight (70kg), expressed in MBq and in round 
numbers, the mean recommended activity of (18F) piflufolastat is 4 MBq/kg of body weight and can 
vary from 3 to 5 MBq/kg of body weight depending on the PET equipment and acquisition mode used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023

The minimum activity should not fall below 190 MBq and the maximum activity should not exceed 360 
MBq. 
Main clinical studies 
The presented clinical data come from multicentre and prospectively designed studies. Osprey and 
Condor studies were single-arm, open label studies conducted in USA and Canada. Similar clinical 
practices on PCa management in USA/Canada and EU justify the extrapolation of data generated with 
the Osprey and Condor population to the European population. 
Osprey study included men at high risk of PCa planned to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP) with 
pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The co-primary endpoints were specificity and sensitivity in 
cohort A (n=268). 
Condor study included 208 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and negative or equivocal 
conventional imaging. The primary endpoint was the correct localisation rate (CLR) at the patient level. 
Python study was a study performed in Europe. It was a cross-over and randomised study to 
demonstrate superiority on per-patient detection rate (DR) of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus 18F-FCH 
PET/CT (18F-fluorocholine PET/CT) in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (n=205). The primary 
endpoint was the detection rate (DR): number of patients defined as positive at patient level by the 
independent readers among the total number of patients assessed (for 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FCH 
PET/CT). 
For initial staging (Osprey study, cohort A), the assessment of efficacy was based on evaluating 
technical performance (inter- and intra- reader variability), diagnostic performance, assessed by two 
co-primary endpoints (specificity and sensitivity), PPV, NPV, and impact on patient management.  
The standard of truth (SoT) for Osprey study was histopathology, which is universally accepted. This 
study was divided in cohort A for initial staging (mainly N-staging) and cohort B for recurrent or 
metastatic PCa. Cohort B of Osprey study (n=117) is not considered as pivotal, only supportive for 
both indications, as the population is different from the clinical settings where efficacy is claimed. 
Condor and Python studies were designed for assessing the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT in biochemical recurrence (BCR) after curative therapy. A composite standard of reference 
(SoR) was established based on, by order of preference, histopathology or findings on conventional 
imaging or clinical follow-up, i.e., PSA response to RT. Using histopathology in BCR is very challenging 
and not always feasible in this population. Thus, a composite standard of reference may be acceptable. 
In Condor study the assessment of efficacy was based on evaluating technical performance (inter- and 
intra- reader variability), diagnostic performance (correct localisation rate at patient level, detection 
rates and PPV by anatomic region and baseline PSA) and change in intended management. Specificity 
was not calculated at patient level as all patients with recurrence based on sPSA increasing were 
considered positive. These efficacy endpoints are acceptable and aligned with clinical practice and the 
requirements of relevant guideline.  
In Python study, efficacy assessment of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT was based on comparing detection rate 
(DR) as primary endpoint and concordance as secondary endpoint in comparison with 18F-FCH PET/CT. 
Sensitivity and impact on change in intended management were also evaluated as secondary 
endpoints. Likewise in Condor study, specificity at patient level was not calculated as all patients with 
first biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy were considered as diseased. Detection rate as 
primary endpoint can be acceptable when confirmation with a standard of reference is feasible. In this 
study, only 37 patients were assessed with a standard of reference, therefore, results have limited 
value.

Primary staging of PCa: Diagnostic performance, inter- and intra-reader variablity, and 
impact on patient management 
The population included in the cohort A of Osprey study were patients at high risk (or very high risk) 
as defined by NCCN guidelines version 3.2016. The main goal of initial staging in this population was 
the detection of metastases in lymph nodes (N-staging). Detecting distal organs metastases (M-
staging) was not the objective in cohort A. Although in 12.3% of patients distant metastasis were 
detected and only 1 patient with osseous metastasis (M1) was confirmed by biopsy, it is recognised 
there is a lack of data on distant metastases and M-staging. Given that Cohort A of Osprey study was 
focused on N staging and that distant metastases has not been studied, relevant statement was added 
to the PI indicating that piflufolastat (18F) was not studied for detection of distant metastases in 
primary staging. 
As lymph node metastases in other lymph node basins including the thorax may be present at the 
diagnosis, as well as bone metastasis, the applicant was requested to provide diagnostic performance 
data for the whole body. However, data for other locations different than pelvic lymph nodes were not 
analysed due to the absence of standard of reference. 
Co-primary endpoint for specificity was reached (96-99%; 95%CI: 93.6-99.4) but the study is 
considered a failed study as the co-primary endpoint for sensitivity (31-42%; 95%CI: 19.2-54.2) did 
not met the pre-specified threshold of the 95%CIs >40% for at least two readers. The reason argued 
by the applicant was that 44% of the population in Cohort A with pathologic nodes had a maximum 
metastatic foci <5mm, which is under the PET scanner detection limit (Crippa et al., 2000). Therefore, 
a post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed excluding these patients, and sensitivity met the success 
criteria whereby the lower limit of the 95%CI exceeded 40% for the same two readers. In this regard, 
a warning has been included in the SmPC to inform that small lymph nodes metastases, or any lesion 
under spatial resolution of PET (= 5 mm) may be missed by piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
Additionally, the applicant performed a post-hoc pelvic lymph node colocalisation analysis to match 
true positive lesions with positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT results in defined templates after PLND. In this 
analysis, specificity was unchanged but sensitivity across all three readers was even lower (27%-
37%).  
The cohort A of Osprey study was not designed to obtain comparative data on diagnostic performance 
of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT with other imaging modalities as requested by the guideline on clinical 
evaluation (Doc. Ref. CPMP/EWP/1119/98/Rev. 1) for new diagnostic agents. However, the applicant 
carried out a post-hoc analysis comparing the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET /CT with 
baseline conventional imaging (CT, MRI). In the post-hoc analysis comparing 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT with 
conventional imaging, results confirmed that sensitivity for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT was slightly lower than 
conventional imaging (40.3% vs 42.6%) but specificity (97.9% vs 65.1%), PPV (86.7% vs 28.3%) and 
NPV (83.2% vs 77.8) was better for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus conventional imaging. Higher 
sensitivity versus specificity in a diagnostic agent is preferred when curative therapy is feasible. In this 
clinical context, lower sensitivity is not so crucial, as all patients would undergo radical prostatectomy 
with pelvic lymph node dissection. Moreover, higher values of specificity and NPV provides higher 
probability to correctly classify negative results, but due to the low sensitivity, a negative result on 
18F-DCFPyL PET/CT did not rule out the disease and additional diagnostic modalities are required. 
Corresponding warning has been included in the SmPC: Clinical correlation, which may include 
histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended. A negative image 
does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence 
of prostate cancer.

In this context, the place of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for initial staging in the diagnostic work-up should be 
in accordance with the EAU/EANM/ESTRO/ESUR/ISUP/SIOG guideline on Prostate Cancer 2022 (Mottet 
et al., 2022).  
Comparative data about radiation exposure between 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and CT or bone scan have 
been provided by the applicant (data not shown). Mean effective dose for piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT is 
9 mSv versus about 15 mSv when contrast-enhanced CT + whole-body bone scan/whole-body PET/CT 
are used.  
Additionally, the applicant has submitted evidence from the literature. In this regard, the most 
outstanding study is the Jansen et al., 2021 study that included 117 patients to assess the accuracy of 
N-staging, and 116/117 patients (99.1% with PSMA expression in the prostate at PET/CT) for the 
accuracy of T-staging. The Jansen et al., 2021 study was comparable in methodology and results to 
the Cohort A of Osprey study. Both studies are also comparable with the van Kalmthout et al., 2020 
study which was selected as primary proof of efficacy for gozetotide for primary staging. 
Considering that cohort A of Osprey study was a failed study for sensitivity and did not improve the 
sensitivity of conventional imaging for detecting N-metastases, staging was practically limited to the 
regional LN detection and evidence from literature is limited, the applicant has discussed the 
consistency of the diagnostic performance across clinical studies and literature (Cohort A vs. Jansen et 
al., 2021 study), showing similar data. The applicant has also discussed the place of 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT in the diagnostic work-up for initial staging.  
The initial claimed indication for primary staging was “initial staging of prostate cancer in patients at 
risk of metastases who are candidates for definitive therapy”. Subsequently, the applicant proposed to 
delete the reference to “initial staging” which was not considered adequate as only detection of PSMA 
positive lesions was considered vague and did not reflect accurately the use of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for 
this clinical setting. 
The applicant agreed to retain primary staging in the first indication wording and submitted additional 
data for M-staging evidence from 40 subjects excluded from the evaluable set where 14 patients had 
an actual change in management due to the results on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT (data not shown). These 
data on M staging cannot be accepted as supportive evidence as these subjects were excluded from 
the evaluable set and there are uncertainties on its validity. 
Moreover, the applicant discussed the similarities between radiopharmaceuticals based on PSMA 
according to relevant guidelines (Mottet et al., 2023; Fendler et al., 2023; Ceci et al., 2021) and the 
Appropriate Use Criteria for Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging (Jadvar et al., 2022).  
Overall, the CHMP considered that there is enough evidence to support the wording of the first 
indication: “Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to initial curative therapy” given that to 
some extent (since expression of PSMA changes over the course of the disease) the ability of 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT to detect distant metastases can be extrapolated from the biochemical recurrence 
(BCR) to primary staging setting and that N-metastases can be detected with low sensitivity, but 
improved specificity.  
Inter- and intra-reader variability was considered acceptable. 
Change in intended management was evaluated using medical management questionnaires before 
and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT considering baseline clinical information of individual patient and 
conventional imaging data. Data showed that 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT led a change in management in 
43.6% (115/264) of patients, suggesting substantial impact that 18F-DCFPyL PET has in the staging of 
patients with high risk prostate cancer and the downstream impact on treatment planning. 18F-DCFPyL

PET/CT results before starting the treatment could modify treatment strategy in this clinical setting but 
change of management based on new imaging modalities without knowing the outputs of treatment is 
not recommended by clinical guidelines (Mottet et al., 2022). In this regard, a warning in section 4.4 
about that no clinical outcome data are currently available has been added: To date no outcome data 
exist to support subsequent management of patients based on PSMA-PET in the primary staging. 
Therefore, treatment should not be changed based on piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT findings only. 
Metastatic or Recurrent PCa: Cohort B Osprey study 
As before mentioned, cohort B of Osprey study cannot be regarded as pivotal as population included 
either metastatic or presumptive recurrent patients based on findings in conventional imaging 
modalities amenable for histopathology confirmation. However, data from this cohort B may be 
considered as supportive for distal staging, both in initial staging and re-staging. 
The strength of this sub-study was the use of histopathology as standard of truth for patients with 
radiologic findings. The main limitation is the heterogeneity of the population as including patients with 
radiologic evidence of local recurrence or new or progressive metastatic disease on anatomical or 
functional imaging modalities.  
Although population in cohort B was different from cohort A, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT demonstrated high 
sensitivity (93%-99%) and PPV (81%-88%) for detecting PCa within biopsied lesions in lymph nodes 
and in distal metastases (M-staging), but no biopsies for prostatic lesions were evaluated in cohort B. 
Evidence on efficacy of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to detect regional and distant metastases can be concluded 
but local metastases (T-staging) were not evaluated in overall Osprey study. 
The false positive (FP) cases detected in Osprey cohort B were bone and lymph node lesions. False 
positive bone lesions were related to benign bone disease such as fractures and Paget’s disease. PSMA 
expression has been observed in ganglia and 18F-DCFPyL uptake can be confounded with pathologic 
lymph nodes. Additionally, other malignancies, diseases and physiological uptake of 18F-DCFPyL has 
been reported (Ceci et al., 2021). The applicant has translated these pitfalls in the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT 
interpretation into the product information (section 4.4): piflufolastat (18F) accumulates in normal 
tissue where the density of PSMA is high including the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, liver, spleen, 
and kidneys. Normal organs demonstrate significant variability in the uptake of piflufolastat (18F); 
however, the impact of tumor burden on normal uptake is minimal and unlikely to be clinically 
significant. The expression of PSMA can predominantly be found in prostate cancer, but can also be 
observed in other neoplasms (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, hepatocarcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer 
and other malignancies) or non-malignant conditions (e.g hemangioma, ganglia, since they can mimic 
lymph nodes, benign bone disease as Paget’s disease, or pulmonary sarcoidosis/granulomatosis).  
Inter- and intra-reader variability was also evaluated in Osprey cohort B study with acceptable values. 
In conclusion, benefit of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in this population may be less noticeable as patients had 
previous radiological evidence of metastatic or recurrent disease.  
BCR: Diagnostic performance, impact on patient management and inter- intra- reader 
variability. 
Results from clinical studies and additional evidence from literature have been submitted by the 
applicant to support the indication for localisation of recurrence in case of rising serum PSA levels after 
treatment. 
In Condor study, diagnostic performance in patients with suspected recurrence of PCa with negative 
or equivocal findings in conventional imaging was evaluated. According to the applicant, it was not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 113/139 
 
 
 
feasible to calculate the specificity and NPV by patient to define the diagnostic performance of 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT due to the lack of true negative results, as all patients suffered from recurrence and 
were considered positive. It is agreed that calculation of specificity and NPV at patient and region level 
was not feasible as only positive PET lesions were followed. Furthermore, it is agreed that 
histopathology by biopsy was difficult to obtain, as patients included in the study had no evidence of 
radiologic recurrence. Diagnostic performance was assessed by correct localisation rates (CLR) as 
primary endpoint, which is considered a PPV at patient level where positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT uptake 
was matched with positive lesions defined by a composite standard of reference. This primary endpoint 
is considered adequate, as the main objective is the localisation of recurrence sites to guide treatment 
decision. 
The composite standard of reference based on, by order of preference, histopathology or findings on 
conventional imaging or clinical follow-up, i.e., PSA response to RT can be considered acceptable. The 
SoR consisted of only 31 patients with histopathology confirmation, 100 patients with correlative 
imaging data and only 1 patient with PSA response after radiotherapy (RT). 
This study was a positive study because the lower bound of the 95%CI (77.8-93.6) exceeded the pre-
specified threshold of 20% for at least two of the three independent blinded central readers. However, 
some concerns were raised about the SoR and the methodology followed in this study. Firstly, only 
positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT patients were followed for efficacy evaluation which isa limitation as 
negative results were not studied. Secondly, local evaluation of PET images instead of central reading 
was used to determine the SoR, therefore, lesions that were not identified by the local readers often 
could not be evaluated. For correlative imaging, the criteria for determining that a lesion represented 
prostate cancer were largely subjective. In addition, the time for collection of follow-up imaging was 
only 60 days, limiting the use of change in size and shape of lesions to assess disease. These issues, 
particularly the subjective reference standard imaging interpretation raised the possibility of bias. 
Despite these limitations, diagnostic performance data are considered sufficient to support the use of 
18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in PCa patients with suspected biochemical recurrence. 
Furthermore, the applicant performed CLR post-analyses by standard of truth method, baseline 
imaging modality and prior therapy. Multiple imputation and tipping point analyses were also carried in 
patients with unevaluable SoR. All these analyses showed a consistently high CLR. 
The impact on patient management was assessed through pre- and post- intended clinical 
management questionnaires. The methodology is considered acceptable. According to the clinical 
guidelines for PCa, localisation of recurrence in BCR after curative treatment by targeted 
radiopharmaceuticals is recommended when change in patient management is expected. In this study, 
the impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT on patient management was an important secondary endpoint. 
Results shed a positive impact on change in intended management after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT (63.9%; 
95%CI: 56.9-70.5).  
Diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in BCR was affected by PSA levels. The applicant 
analysed the CLR and detection rate (DR) by baseline PSA levels. As expected, detection rate increased 
with higher baseline PSA levels. These results have a relevant impact on the diagnostic performance 
for biochemical recurrence, and results have been included in the product information (see SmPC 
section 5.1).  
Detection rate and PPV was also calculated by anatomic region level (prostatic, pelvic and extrapelvic 
region), showing a high PPV in all anatomic regions and lower DR in prostate region (17.8-21.2) 
compared with pelvic region (33.7-37.5) and extra-pelvic region (25.5-3.3).  
Inter- and intra-reader variability evaluation was performed and was acceptable.

No direct comparison with other authorized radiopharmaceuticals for BCR (Axumin (fluciclovine (18F)) 
or 18F-FCH) was performed in the Condor Study. However, the applicant carried over the Python 
study, a prospective, multicenter and comparative study performed in European countries to 
demonstrate superiority of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus 18F-FCH PET/CT. 
In Python study, a cross over comparison between the investigational medicinal product and an 
acceptable comparator (18F-FCH) approved for localisation of BCR after definitive therapy was 
performed as required by the guideline on diagnostic agents. Patients with confirmed histopathology of 
prostate adenocarcinoma at first BCR after definitive therapy were included in this study, 
independently of results in baseline conventional imaging modalities. 
Detection rate (DR) was the primary endpoint to assess diagnostic performance. This can be 
acceptable, as sensitivity and specificity are difficult to calculate due to the difficulty to obtain 
histological confirmation in this clinical setting. However, only comparing detection rate without 
confirmation with a robust SoR is considered not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy as required by the 
relevant guideline for evaluation of diagnostic agents. Only comparison of detection rates from both 
radiopharmaceuticals has limited value as these radiopharmaceuticals have different diagnostic 
performance, mechanism of action, biodistribution and different physiological uptake. These issues 
raised uncertainties on the results. These shortcomings could have been overcome with an acceptable 
standard of reference to confirm the localisation of recurrence with both radiopharmaceuticals. 
Notwithstanding, some efficacy data have demonstrated superiority of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus 18F-
FCH PET/CT on overall DR and on DR by subgroups considering initial treatment, PSA levels, PSAdt, 
D´Amico risk class and ISUP grade.  
The study was a positive study because the differences on DR at patient level between 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT were significative (P-value <0.0001) and the 12% increase on DR at 
patient level was reached (58.2% vs 40.3%) respectively. However, results on DR for 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT were lower than reported in literature. The drastic conditions used in a 
controlled clinical study may have influenced the performances compared to literature reports. 
18F-DCFPyL did not seem to perform better than 18F-FCH in disease detection in the pelvic and ePLNs. 
However, when discordant cases were analysed by the truth panel, correct localisation rate results of 
18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in pelvic LN and extra-pelvic LN were better than correct localisation rate with 
18F-FCH PET/CT. 
Sensitivity was a secondary objective. The Truth Panel assessed only 37 patients per region according 
to the SoR. The SoR consisted of the combination of test available at baseline and performed in clinical 
routine practice up 10 months after last radiopharmaceutical injection. This follow-up was at discretion 
of the investigator. No data about the criteria followed to classify each case is provided. Neither 
justification of follow-up time, nor findings if histopathology was used, i.e., location, number and size 
of lesion, metastatic pattern (oligo- multi-metastatic). However, the criteria followed was based on 
routine practice during multidisciplinary meetings taking into account the baseline information, 
histopathological conclusions, and additional imaging examinations if performed during the follow-up. 
This can be considered adequate as it reflects the current clinical practice. 
Detection rate intra- and inter- variability was calculated at patient level but some discrepancies in 
intra- reading for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT were shown but no with 18F-FCH PET/CT. Inter-reader 
agreement was moderate, Fleiss’ kappa 0.55 (0.47; 0.63) and 0.54 (0.45; 0.63). Images should be 
interpreted only by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with piflufolastat (18F). In this 
regard, an updated RMP to include a reader training as additional risk minimization measure has been 
proposed by the applicant. This is considered adequate.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023

Concordance rate at region level was evaluated in Python study, showing acceptable results between 
18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT. Discordant results were analysed by the Truth panel using 
the SoR. 
The impact on patient management was also assessed by the Truth Panel in two ways, prospectively 
as proposed by the Truth panel resulting 26.0% (n=53/204) for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and 21.3% 
(n=43/202) for 18F-FCH PET/CT. The second way was after implementing treatment considering PET 
information. The Truth Panel determined retrospectively the impact resulting 44.1% for 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT versus an impact of 28.7 for 18F-FCH PET/CT. Methodology and results are considered 
acceptable. 
In conclusion, Python study can be considered as supportive for localisation of biochemical recurrence 
after curative therapy. Considering the evidence presented with the most robust Condor study, the 
additional supportive data from Cohort B of Osprey study and the literature submitted by the applicant, 
overall clinical benefit is considered shown for this indication.  
The wording of the indication for localisation of recurrence in case of rising serum PSA levels has been 
adapted according to the data submitted and focused on the type of recurrence and definitive therapy 
patients were undergone (see SmPC section 4.1). The applicant has also presented sufficient data on 
18F-DCFPyL PET/CT from literature to support efficacy for localisation of recurrence in BCR setting.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data submitted by the applicant are considered sufficient to substantiate the claimed indications for 
Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to initial curative therapy and to localize recurrence 
of PCa in patients with a suspected recurrence based on increasing serum prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) levels after primary treatment with curative intent. 
From the submitted data it can be concluded that Pylclari PET/CT may contribute to the diagnostics of 
PCa during primary staging and localisation of recurrence in case of rising serum PSA levels after 
treatment.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The overall safety profile is based on data from its administration to 797 patients from three clinical 
studies OSPREY, CONDOR and PYTHON and spontaneous reporting. 
Safety analyses were performed on the following populations:  
• 
Pooled Safety Population from OSPREY and CONDOR (n=593).  
-  Recurrent or metastatic PCa Analysis Group (n=325). A subset of pooled safety population 
including only patients from OSPREY Cohort B and CONDOR, and based on their similar 
characteristics (men with recurrent or metastatic PCa). 
-  High Risk PCa Analysis Group (n=268): A subset of pooled safety population including only 
patients from OSPREY Cohort A. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023

•  Safety Population from PYTHON (n=204). Patients with first BCR who received a dose of 18F-
DCFPyL in PYTHON. 
•  Urinalysis Set (OSPREY): Patients who received a dose of 18F-DCFPyL and have urinalysis 
results in an investigator-sponsored trial.  
All patients received a single IV injection. Patients from OSPREY and CONDOR received 333±37 MBq as 
a single IV injection, PET/CT initiated 60-120 minutes after injection and patients from PYTHON were 
planned to receive one single intravenous injection of 330 MBq of 18F-DCFPyL (330-360 MBq) and one 
single intravenous injection of 18F-FCH at an activity of 2 to 4 MBq/kg body weight (140-280 MBq). 
The order or administration was randomized. A 10 % variation in target activity was allowed. PET/CT 
initiated 120 (± 15) minutes after injection. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
In OSPREY, TEAEs were defined for all patients as AEs occurring from the day of, but after 18F-DCFPyL 
administration, through the date of (but prior to) surgery or through 21 (± 7) days post-biopsy. 
In CONDOR, AEs were captured from the time of administration until the scheduled safety follow-up 
telephone call 7 (±3) days after dosing. 
In both study populations, 65 patients (11%) had TEAEs.  Majority had Grade 1 (mild) TEAEs (51, 9%) 
than Grade 2 (moderate) (8, 1%) or Grade 3 (severe) (6, 1%). No patient had a Grade 4 (life 
threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) TEAE.  
A larger proportion of patients with at least one TEAE was reported in the high-risk group (39, 15%) 
compared to the recurrent or metastatic group (26, 8%).  
However, most patients in the high-risk group (37/39, 95%) had only Grade 1 TEAEs. 
Out of all the TEAEs, 5% (30 patients) were drug related. Most common TEAEs reported in less than 
1% of the population. These were headache (2%), dysgeusia (2%) and fatigue (1%) and these usually 
showed up between day 1 and day 3 drug dosing.  
In PYTHON, TEAEs were considered when appeared at the time or during the following 24h after drug 
administration. Four patients reported at least one TEAEs, and a total of 6 types of TEAEs were 
observed, the most common (which occurred in ≥1% of patients) were headache. None led to 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Among the 797 patients, a total of 108 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 
69 (8.6 %) patients, with headache (1.4%), dysgeusia (1.0%), and fatigue (0.5%) being the most 
frequent. Three serious drug-related adverse events (hypersensitivity, headache, and paresthesia) 
were reported, all experienced by one patient and only hypersensitivity was assessed as drug-related 
in this patient who had a significant history of allergic reactions. All three serious drug-related adverse 
events were resolved.

Two patients reported coronary artery disease and one patient reported the other SAEs.  
Two severe SAEs, hypersensitivity reaction and hyperkalaemia, were reported with a start date 
between days 2-3. Hypersensitivity reaction was assessed as related to study drug, and hyperkalaemia 
was assessed as unrelated to study drug. All mild to moderate SAEs were reported on day 4 or later. 
No deaths were reported in OSPREY, CONDOR or PYTHON. No SAEs were reported and no treatment 
discontinuations in PYTHON.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
•  Haematology and clinical chemistry 
Shifts out of the normal range were most common for normal to low haematocrit (8% of patients), 
erythrocytes (7%), and haemoglobin (5%) and normal to high leukocytes (85%).  
For clinical chemistry lab shifts out of the normal range were most common for normal to high glucose 
(9% of patients), normal to low calcium (7%), normal to high bilirubin (6%), and normal to high blood 
urea nitrogen (4%). 
According to the applicant seven patients had clinically significant abnormalities at follow-up that were 
not present at baseline (high alanine aminotransferase in 2 patients; high glucose, high aspartate 
aminotransferase, high bilirubin, high triglycerides, and high potassium in 1 patient each). 
Leukocyte and Triglyceride results were not reported for the majority of patients at follow-up . 
•  Vital signs 
Blood pressure and pulse rate were almost unchanged from baseline in study OSPREY and CONDOR.  
For PYTHON, changes were measured 15min and 2 hours (± 15min) after injection. Neither blood 
pressure nor pulse rate changed. 
•  Electrocardiogram 
Data were collected from 12 patients before and after drug dosage.  
•  Urinalysis 
Urine samples were collected for analysis 24 hours after drug dosage and were collected for nine 
patients of the total of study population. 
For these patients, the presence of bilirubin, blood, nitrite and protein were negative. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
• 
Intrinsic Factors 
Following IV administration of 18F-DCFPyL at the recommended dose of 4 MBq/Kg BW, the highest 
estimated radiation absorbed dose was in the kidneys. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic data showed that 
18F-DCFPyL is excreted in the urine. Therefore, TEAEs were examined by renal function for patients in 
OSPREY. The incidence of TEAEs was 16/105 (15%) for patients with normal renal function, 28/245 
(11%) for patients with mild renal impairment, and 6/30 (20%) in patients with moderate/severe renal 
impairment. There were no notable differences in the incidence of TEAEs by renal function. 
The most common TEAEs, headache, dysgeusia, and fatigue, were reported only in patients with 
normal renal function or mild renal impairment. 
TEAEs related to 18F-DCFPyL are summarised by age group (<65 and ≥65 years) 
The incidence of the most common TEAEs was similar in each age group. Headache was reported in 6 
patients (3%) <65 years old and 7 patients (2%) ≥65 years old; dysgeusia, in 6 patients (3%) and 4 
patients (1%); respectively; and fatigue, in 4 patients (2%) and 3 patients (1%), respectively.

Among the 238 patients who were <65 years old, 31 (13%) had TEAEs, and of 355 patients who were 
≥65 years old, 34 (10%) had TEAEs. 
Safety analysis by age group has not been performed in PYTHON. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
See 2.6.9.  
2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There has been no discontinuation of 18F-DCFPyL treatment due to adverse effects. 
2.6.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
PYLARIFY (piflufolastat F 18) Injection was approved by the US FDA on 26 May 2021 for PET of 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with PCa: with suspected 
metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy and with suspected recurrence based on 
elevated serum PSA level. During the period 26 May 2021 to 17 November 2022, 98 533 patients were 
exposed to PYLARIFY. No new safety signals have been identified from marketing experience. Till the 
launch on the US market, no new safety signals have been identified from marketing experience in 
respect of approved use, off-label use, administration to special populations, medication errors, 
overdose or abuse.  
One single patient experienced five serious adverse reactions within a few minutes after PYLARIFY 
administration: syncope, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. He was transported to the 
emergency department, recovered from the events, and was discharged home in stable condition that 
same day. Syncope, nausea, and vomiting were not listed in the SmPC, and considered as related to 
PYLARIFY, and therefore added with a ‘not known’ frequency. 
In Spain, compassionate use was approved for 18F-DCFPyL on June 19, 2020. From 16 July 2020 till 
17 November 2022, 5625 patients received 18F-DCFPyL. Additionally, during the same period, 186 
patients were exposed under name-patient basis approval in Belgium, and 1360 in the Netherlands. 
There have been no new safety signals identified in these programs. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Studies OSPREY, CONDOR and PYTHON support the use of Pylclari as a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic 
agent for (1) the primary staging of patients with high risk PCa prior to initial curative therapy; and (2) 
the localisation of recurrence of PCa with a suspected recurrence based on increasing PSA levels after 
primary treatment with curative intent.  
The safety database is composed of 797 patients, 593 for studies OSPREY and CONDOR and 204 for 
study PYTHON who received a single injection of 18F-DCFPyL. 268 patients had high risk PCa (OSPREY 
Cohort A) and 325 patients had recurrent or metastatic PCa (OSPREY Cohort B and CONDOR). The 
population included in the trials is the one expected for the evaluation of this class of products. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 121/139 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety data from studies OSPREY and CONDOR has been pooled for most analyses. This is reasonable 
as similar dose of the product was used in both trials and both studies enrolled prostate cancer 
patients so relevant differences between disease status are not expected to impact safety. 
Nevertheless, data from study PYTHON could have been included in an "integrated safety report" 
rather than presenting its safety results in isolation, as differences in safety in the studied population 
are not expected either.  
Additionally, 2228 patients have received at least one dose of 18F-DCFPyL in ongoing clinical trials for 
which safety data are not available for assessment. A summary of safety data from 230 prostate 
cancer patients coming from two published clinical trials is also available. Overall, the safety database 
is regarded adequate. 
Mean recommended activity for 18F-DCFPyL was 330 MBq (range: 300-360 MBq), administered as a 
single intravenously (IV) dose. The median decay corrected dose at the time of administration was 
340.4 MBq in OSPREY and CONDOR, and 321.19 (186.9-373.0) MBq in PYTHON.   
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. As the effective dose is 4.2 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 360 
MBq is administered in a 70 kg-weighted patient, these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a 
low probability. 
The dose administered in the trials was not adjusted by age, BMI or renal function. It seems 
acceptable since there were no significant differences between the BMI of the patients in the three 
studies, neither by renal function nor by age range.  The applicant has proposed the dose by BW to be 
aligned with the majority of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals which is acceptable. The mean 
recommended activity of (18F) piflufolastat is 4 MBq/kg of body weight and can vary from 3 to 5 
MBq/kg of body weight depending on the PET equipment and acquisition mode used. The minimum 
activity should not fall below 190 MBq and the maximum activity should not exceed 360 MBq. (see also 
2.6.6 and 2.6.8.1). 
Piflufolastat (18F) has only been studied in patients with mild renal impairment. 18F-DCFPyL is excreted 
mainly by renal way. There were no data on severe renal impairment but the applicant has discussed 
the impact of radiation exposure in these patients, and has included appropriate information in section 
4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of SmPC. 
The product currently is not intended to be used in women, and this is reflected in the PI. It is also not 
intended to be used in paediatric population due to specificities of the disease. 
The safety profile of 18F-DCFPyL appears benign. The incidence of AEs was quite low and AEs were 
manageable. The most common AEs was headache. Hypersensitivity was reported in 1% of patients 
from the clinical trials. Anaphylactic reactions are correctly included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Overall, the adverse event profile is adequately reflected in the product information proposed. 
One serious AEs was considered related to treatment (hypersensitivity). No deaths were reported.  
Only one case of syncope derived from spontaneous reporting in the post-marketing use in the USA 
has been identified and included in the SmPC. 
Clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters were reported in seven patients in study OSPREY 
but overall, these findings are considered unlikely related to 18F-DCFPyL considering to low mass dose 
administered. Changes in mean QTc values were not clinically relevant. 
Differences between regions (European versus non-European) do not seem relevant in terms of 
incidence of AE. The impact of other extrinsic factors has not been discussed by the applicant.

Due to the extremely low chemical mass in an administered dose, meaningful interactions with 
metabolising enzymes, transporters, or ion channels are highly unlikely (Pre-IND WRO, 2016). In 
addition, 18F-DCFPyL does not undergo meaningful metabolism, as demonstrated in PCa patients, 
indicating that blood concentrations of 18F-DCFPyL are not expected to be affected by the presence of 
concomitant inducer or inhibitor drug. 
Data from published literature do not suggest additional AEs although the limitations of the 
interpretation of these data are fully acknowledged. 
Safety data available from post-marketing experience (from the USA) and from compassionate 
programmes with cut-off dates of 2022 have been provided. Safety data looks consistent with what is 
known from the clinical trials.  
Incorrect image interpretations can have important consequences for the patients therefore images 
should be interpreted only by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with piflufolastat 
(18F). In this regard, ‘PET imaging interpretation errors’ is included in the RMP as an important 
potential risk and a reader training is to be set up as additional risk minimization measure. Moreover, 
an observational study to evaluate Physician Training Methods to read (18F)-DCFPyL PET scans will be 
performed by the applicant to address the question of the effectiveness of (18F)- DCFPYL training 
programme to prevent PET imaging interpretation errors (false negative investigation result, false 
positive investigation result). See also section 2.7. 
Specifications related to radiation protection in the context of manipulation and elimination of the 
radiopharmaceutical by healthcare professionals, and radiation protection for the family have been 
adequately discussed. Close contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the 
initial 12 hours following the injection (see SmPC section 4.4). Radiopharmaceuticals should be 
received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their 
receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licences 
of the competent official organisation. Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which 
satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic 
precautions should be taken4 (see SmPC section 6.6). 
This product is administered via an intravenous flexible catheter. The administration must be strictly 
intravenous in order to avoid irradiation as a result of local extravasation, as well as imaging artefacts. 
The bolus administration will be followed by a flush of 5-10 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection, to ensure full delivery of the dose. Instructions on dilution of the medicinal 
product before administration have been included in the SmPC (see section 12). If at any time in the 
preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of the vial is compromised it should not be used. 
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. The 
administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should 
be disposed of in accordance with local requirements5. 
18F-DCFPyL could be used for the same patients more than once (for instance, for monitoring of 
disease progression, or treatment effects, etc). The applicant has discussed the safety of repeated 
injections of 18F-DCFPyL, and repetition of 18F-piflufolastat PET/CT is not considered as an issue.

2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, a single administration of Pylclari (piflufolastat (18F)) as an I.V. injection, mean 4 
MBq/Kg BW from 3 to 5 MBq/kg of body weight, is considered to have an acceptable safety profile 
given low number of safety reports in clinical trials and in the literature and mostly mild severity of the 
reported AEs.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the ‘Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’. Indeed, the user 
consultation  complies  with  the  requirements  and  recommendations  of  articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of 
Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. This package leaflet was found to contain 
all the necessary information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated 
in this test.  
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Pylclari (piflufolastat (18F)) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indications are 1) initial staging of prostate cancer in patients at risk of metastases who 
are candidates for definitive therapy, and 2) for localisation of recurrence in case of rising serum PSA 
levels after treatment. 
Prostate cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in EU: according to data from Eurostat, 
about 65 200 men died from PCa in 2016. The standardised death rate from prostate cancer stood in 
EU at 38 deaths per 100 000 male inhabitants. Early identification of metastatic disease, both at initial 
staging and at any point after initial definitive therapy may have the potential to improve patient 
outcomes. Indeed, up to one half of men treated with curative intent following a diagnosis of primary 
PCa will experience the recurrent disease within 10 to 15 years following therapy. The use of a non-
invasive whole-body functional imaging to reliably detect, monitor, and restage PCa will offer 
physicians valuable information on a patient’s disease state and improve treatment management. 
Diagnostic work-up of PCa is complex. Main task of staging is identification of extent of the primary 
tumour (T), lymph node (N) involvement, and presence or absence of distant metastases (M), along 
with the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and the histologic grade group (based on the 
Gleason score) of the primary tumour to classify men into prognostic stage groups to further decide on 
optimal treatment strategy. Various diagnostic imaging tools (CT, MRI, PET, bone scan, etc.) are 
applied to support PCa diagnosis (primary and after definitive therapy and return of PSA elevation) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 127/139 
 
 
 
 
primary staging/restaging. Conventional imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, whole body bone 
scintigraphy) are suboptimal for detecting small metastatic lesions or occult locoregional recurrence. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP–SIOG Guidelines on prostate cancer (Mottet el al., 2022) 
recommends that for initial staging, the patients with high-risk disease are staged for metastases using 
at least cross-sectional abdominopelvic imaging and a bone-scan. According to this guideline, evidence 
shows that choline PET/CT, PSMA PET/CT and whole-body MRI provide a more sensitive detection of 
LN- and bone metastases than the classical work-up with bone scan and abdominopelvic CT. Replacing 
bone scan and abdominopelvic CT by more sensitive imaging modalities may be a consideration in 
patients with high-risk PCa undergoing initial staging. However, the guideline remarks that in absence 
of prospective studies demonstrating survival benefit, caution must be used when taking therapeutic 
decisions. 
In patients suffering BCR after curative treatment, PSMA-PET/CT is recommended only if the results 
may influence subsequent therapy. According to the above guideline, in patients with BCR, imaging 
can detect both local recurrences and distant metastases, however, the sensitivity of detection 
depends on the PSA level. After radical prostatectomy (RP), PSMA PET/CT seems to be the imaging 
modality with the highest sensitivity at low PSA levels (<0.5 ng/mL) and may help distinguishing 
patients with recurrences confined to the prostatic fossa from those with distant metastases which may 
impact the design and use of post-RP salvage radiotherapy (RT). After RT, MRI has shown excellent 
results at detecting local recurrences and guiding prostate biopsy. Given the substantial morbidity of 
post-RT local salvage treatments, distant metastases must be ruled out in patients with local 
recurrences and who are fit for these salvage therapies. Choline-, 18F-fluciclovine- or PSMA-PET/CT 
can be used to detect metastases in these patients but for this indication PSMA PET/CT seems the most 
sensitive technique.  
Overall, it is recognised that conventional imaging modalities display lower sensitivity in prostate 
cancer diagnostic than PET/CT with 18F-fluciclovine, Choline- and PSMA based radiopharmaceuticals. 
Moreover, better sensitivity for PSMA PET/CT has been reported over radiopharmaceuticals based on 
choline and 18F-fluciclovine.  
Recently, gozetotide (PSMA-11) under the trade name Locametz was approved in the EU as a kit for 
radiopharmaceutical preparation (EMEA/H/C/005488). Additionally, the radiopharmaceutical ready for 
use, 18F-PSMA-1007, under the trade name of Radelumin has been approved in some EU countries 
(FR/H/0797/001-002MR) in the same clinical settings  than Pylclari (PET performance in patient with 
BCR of PCa after RT). 
Considering the increasing use of PSMA PET/CT in the EU and the above clinical practice 
recommendations for these clinical settings, the approval of a new PSMA based radiopharmaceutical is 
expected to be of benefit in the diagnostic of PCa  across the European Union countries. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Main clinical studies are summarised as follows: 
Primary staging 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 128/139 
 
 
 
 
 
Osprey study, cohort A (n=268): A multicentre, phase 2/3, open-label, nonrandomised, controlled 
study designed to assess the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT against histopathology, 
focused on lymph nodes assessment after dissection (N staging), in patients at high risk of PCa 
planned to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP) with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). Co-primary 
endpoints were specificity and sensitivity of piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT against histopathology within 
the pelvic lymph nodes.  
The Osprey study, cohort B (n=117), was designed to assess the diagnostic performance of 18F-
DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with metastatic or recurrent PCa with radiologic evidence of disease. This 
cohort may be considered as supportive of the two claimed indications as population is not represented 
in the clinical settings where efficacy is claimed. 
BCR 
- Condor study (n=208): A multicentre, phase 3, open-label, single-arm, nonrandomised, controlled 
study aimed to determine the correct localisation rate (CLR) of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the detection of 
recurrent PCa at the patient level in patients suffering from BCR after definitive therapy and with 
negative or equivocal baseline imaging information. Lesions were validated by a composite reference 
standard (histopathology or correlative imaging or clinical follow-up, by order of preference). 
- Python study (n=215): a multicentre, phase 3, open-label, cross-over, randomised, controlled study 
aimed to compare per-patient detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT versus 18F-FCH PET/CT 
(superiority) in patients at first BCR after definitive therapy. Lesions were validated by a composite 
reference standard (histopathology or correlative imaging or clinical follow-up, by order of preference).

comparable, NPV was slightly higher, specificity was improved, and PPV of 18F-DCFPyL PET was 3-fold

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Pylclari is dosed based on body weight. Supportive evidence (dose-finding studies) for this body weight 
based dosing was not provided. However, a further analysis was made across all 3 pivotal studies 
(PYTHON, OSPREY, CONDOR) showing that the mean injected activity per kilogram of body weight and 
the median activity were quite homogeneous across the 3 studies: mean activity of 3.87 MBq/kg. 
Therefore, the mean recommended activity of (18F) piflufolastat is 4 MBq/kg of body weight and can 
vary from 3 to 5 MBq/kg of body weight depending on the PET equipment and acquisition mode used. 
The minimum activity should not fall below 190 MBq and the maximum activity should not exceed 360 
MBq. 
- Initial staging indication: initial staging of prostate cancer in patients at risk of metastases who are 
candidates for definitive therapy. 
The cohort A in Osprey study was a failed study, as sensitivity did not reach the prespecified threshold. 
However, specificity, PPV and NPV were better for 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT than conventional imaging. 
Higher sensitivity versus specificity in a diagnostic agent is preferred when curative therapy is feasible. 
In patients who are candidates for definitive therapy, lower sensitivity is not so crucial, as all patients 
would undergo radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection, and higher values of specificity 
and NPV provide higher probability to classify correctly negative results, which is a benefit for patients. 
However, due to the low sensitivity, a negative result on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT does not rule out the 
disease, and additional diagnostic modalities are required.  To address this uncertainty, a warning has 
been added in the SmPC: Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the 
suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended. A negative image does not rule out the presence of 
prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. 
The selected population in Cohort A consisted of PCa patients at high risk of metastases and the first 
indication adequately reflects the risk categorization of the population. However, the Cohort A was 
focused mainly on regional metastases detection (N staging), while no evidence was provided on local 
staging (T staging). Additional evidence for the whole body (Cohort B of Osprey study) and for T-
staging from literature (Jansen et al. 2021) was provided as supportive information. The CHMP 
considered that there is sufficient evidence to support the use of  Pylclari for primary staging of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 130/139 
 
 
 
 
patients with high-risk PCa prior to initial curative therapy given that to some extent (since expression 
of PSMA changes over the course of the disease) the ability of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to detect distant 
metastases can be extrapolated from the biochemical recurrence (BCR) to primary staging setting and 
that N-metastases can be detected with low sensitivity, but improved specificity.  
The limitations of the submitted evidence (lack of data on distant metastases and M-staging, that co-
primary endpoint on sensitivity failed, that PET did not improve sensitivity compared to conventional 
imaging) have been adequately reflected in the product information. 
- Condor study 
Some concerns have been raised related to the composite standard of reference (SoR) that could have 
biased the results.  
Local evaluation of PET images instead of central reading was used to determine the SoR. The 
applicant clarified that, without a truth standard, the patient was considered unevaluable for the 
primary analysis. The primary endpoint of correct localization rate for the 3 central readers with the 
respective 95% confidence intervals were: Reader 1: 85.6% (78.8, 92.3); Reader 2: 87.0% (80.4, 
93.6), Reader 3: 84.8% (77.8, 91.9). A sensitivity analysis was performed treating all unevaluable 
patients as false positive scans. The results (Table 10 of CSR) were: 80.2% (95% CI: 72.8%-87.6%), 
82.1% (95% CI: 74.8%-89.4%), and 80.8% (95% CI: 73.2%-88.3%) for Readers 1-3, respectively. 
The SoR consisted of only 31 patients with histopathology confirmation, 100 patients with correlative 
imaging data and only 1 patient with PSA response after radiotherapy (RT). Correlative imaging criteria 
were subjective but considered acceptable as although subjective, the criteria for determining a lesion 
as positive or negative was predefined in the section 8.3 of the imaging review charter. 
The time for collection of follow-up imaging was only 60 days, limiting the use of change in size and 
shape in lesions to assess the disease. The protocol was designed to have the truth standard obtained 
within 60 days of the PET scan so that the two assessments could be obtained within a short period 
before disease progression could potentially occur. This relatively short interval was intended to reduce 
potential bias that could occur in case of a longer time interval between the PET scan and the 
assessment of standard of truth. The time for collection of follow-up was predefined in the imaging 
review charter of Condor study. 
- Python study 
The validity of the study is a concern due to the deficiencies in the composite standard of reference. 
Only 37 patients were assessed per region. This is due to few patients undergoing other imaging tests, 
making impossible to determine the SoR in most of the patients, and that the majority, especially in 
case of one positive PET/CT, received subsequent systemic therapy, which made it impossible to 
determine the SoR at a region level. 
SoR consisted of the combination of test available at baseline and performed in clinical routine practice 
up 10 months after last radiopharmaceutical injection. This follow-up was at discretion of the 
investigator. No data are provided about the criteria followed to classify each case according to the 
standard of reference. According to the applicant, the criteria followed was based on routine practice 
during multidisciplinary meetings taking into account the baseline information, histopathological 
conclusions, and additional imaging examinations if performed during the follow-up. This can be 
considered adequate as it reflects the current clinical practice.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Around 11% of patients participating in the clinical development had AEs. The most common was 
headache (1.2% for recurrent or metastatic PCa, 1% in PYTHON study), and dysgeusia (3.4%) for 
patients in the high-risk group of PCa in the pooled analysis, and none for the PYTHON study. 
Hypersensitivity was reported by 1% of patients in the pooled analysis and by none in the study 
PYTHON. 
SAE were reported in 10 patients in studies OSPREY and CONDOR although all except the 
hypersensitivity case were considered not related to the drug by the applicant.  
Data from published studies and compassionate programs have not identified new AEs. Syncope, 
nausea, and vomiting were derived from spontaneous reporting in the post-marketing use in the USA. 
As one single patient experienced five serious adverse reactions within a few minutes after PYLARIFY 
administration: syncope, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Syncope, nausea, and vomiting 
as not listed in the US SmPC and considered as related to PYLARIFY, and therefore added with a not 
known frequency. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main identified uncertainties are the following:  
Patients with severe renal impairment were not included in the studies so there is lack of data in these 
patients.  Absence of these data is adequately reflected in the product information. 
Incorrect image interpretations can have important consequences for the patients. “PET imaging 
interpretation errors” has been included in the RMP as an important potential risk. Regarding the 
Important potential risk PET imaging interpretation error, an educational material for Healthcare 
professionals has been included in the updated RMP v 0.5.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Conventional imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, whole body bone scintigraphy) are suboptimal for 
detecting small metastatic lesions or occult locoregional recurrence in patients suffering from PCa. 
It is recognised that availability of more sensitive non-invasive diagnostic tool would be important to 
guide the doctors in decision-making on treatment/patient management in PCa. Although there are 
uncertainties related to the limited evidence of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for primary staging and despite the 
limitations of the studies, submitted data suggest that 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT may offer improvements in 
diagnostics of PCa during primary staging of patients at high-risk of metastases and in the staging on 
patients suffering BCR. 
The assessment of the impact on patient management showed considerable effects which could 
translate into clinical benefit, mainly for BCR patients. For primary staging, caution must be considered 
when taking therapeutic decisions in absence of prospective studies demonstrating survival benefit. A 
statement has been added to the SmPC (4.4): To date no outcome data exist to support subsequent 
management of patients based on PSMA-PET in the primary staging. Therefore, treatment should not 
be changed based on piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT findings only. 
Studies demonstrated good levels of inter-reader agreement when assessing the reliability of the 
image read. 
It is agreed that most SAEs seem related to common conditions in the relatively old male population 
suffering prostate cancer or/and can be explained by their medical history/underlying diseases, once 
narratives are revised. No SAEs were reported in study PYTHON. No deaths observed in studies 
OSPREY, CONDOR or PYTHON.   
No critical safety findings were identified. Overall, the safety profile of 18F-DCFPyL appears acceptable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, evidence provided to support efficacy, and the favourable safety profile is considered sufficient 
to substantiate a positive benefit/risk balance in primary staging of patients at high-risk of metastases 
and in the staging on patients suffering BCR.  
Pylclari may contribute to the diagnostics of PCa during primary staging and diagnosis of PCa 
recurrence in patients with BCR. Given the low number of safety reports in the literature and in the 3 
pivotal studies (PYTHON, OSPREY and CONDOR) and mostly mild severity of the reported AEs, it can 
be concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Pylclari is positive subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Pylclari is favourable in the following indication(s): 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Pylclari is indicated for the detection of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions 
with positron emission tomography (PET) in adults with prostate cancer (PCa) in the following clinical 
settings:  
• 
Primary staging of patients with high-risk PCa prior to initial curative therapy,  
To localize recurrence of PCa in patients with a suspected recurrence based on increasing serum 
• 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after primary treatment with curative intent. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279917/2023 
Page 138/139 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Pylclari (piflufolastat (18F)) in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including 
communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the 
National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The educational programme is aimed to reduce the risk of PET imaging interpretation errors.  
The MAH shall ensure that, in each Member State where Pylclari (piflufolastat (18F)) is marketed, 
medical practitioners qualified to interpret PET scans in their country who are expected to use Pylclari 
(piflufolastat (18F)) have access to the self-training educational material.  
- Provision of a self-training program containing the following information: 
- Physiological distribution of piflufolastat (18F). 
- Image interpretation guidelines. 
- Examples of incidental findings on PET-CT with piflufolastat (18F). 
- Examples of positive and negative findings on PET-CT with piflufolastat (18F) 
- Demonstration cases with image interpretation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from PRAC. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of available data, the CHMP considered that this radiopharmaceutical is a new 
active substance as the coupling mechanism to link piflufolastat and fluorine-18 (18F) has not been 
authorised previously in the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

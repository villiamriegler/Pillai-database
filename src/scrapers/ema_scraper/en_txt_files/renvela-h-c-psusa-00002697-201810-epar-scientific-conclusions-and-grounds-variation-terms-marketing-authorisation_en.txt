Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sevelamer, the scientific conclusions 
of the CHMP are as follows:  
During the period covered by this PSUR 14 case reports of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders associated with 
sevelamer crystals have been published, including one case of colonic/caecal mass formation. 
Considering the seriousness of these events, the increasing number of well-documented and published 
reported cases, including the 4 cases with a positive dechallenge after discontinuation of sevelamer only, 
the risk of “sevelamer crystals associated with serious gastrointestinal disorders” should be updated in 
section 4.4 and should also be reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC and in the corresponding sections of 
the package leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sevelamer the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sevelamer is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

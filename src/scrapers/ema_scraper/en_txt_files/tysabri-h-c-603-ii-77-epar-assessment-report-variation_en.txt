2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tysabri  is  a  selective  adhesion  molecule  inhibitor.  It  specifically  exerts  its  immunologic  effects  by 
targeting  the  α4β1  integrin  receptor,  which  has  a  key  role  in  the  migration  of  leucocytes,  most  notably 
lymphocytes, from the peripheral blood into inflamed tissue. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the rationale for 
natalizumab therapy is to taper off the transmigration of mononuclear leukocytes from  the bloodstream 
across  the  endothelium  into  inflamed  parenchymal  tissue,  included  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
parenchyma, by specifically targeting α4β1, or very-late-activation antigen 4 (VLA-4). 
Tysabri  is  currently  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  highly  active  relapsing  remitting 
multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups: 
  Adult  patients  aged  18  years  and  over  with  high  disease  activity  despite  treatment  with  a  beta 
interferon or glatiramer acetate. 
These  patients  may  be  defined  as  those  who  have  failed  to  respond  to  a  full  and  adequate  course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of  beta-interferon or glatiramer  acetate.  Patients should have 
had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions 
in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “non-responder” 
could  also  be  defined  as  a  patient  with  an  unchanged  or  increased  relapse  rate  or  ongoing  severe 
relapses, as compared to the previous year. 
or 
  Adult  patients  aged  18  years  and  over  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more  disabling  relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium 
enhancing  lesions  on  brain  MRI  or  a  significant  increase  in  T2  lesion  load  as  compared  to  a 
previous recent MRI. 
The recommended dose of Tysabri is 300 mg administered by intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks. 
At the time of the initial marketing authorization application, the efficacy of Tysabri in patients with RRMS 
has  been  established  in  two  pivotal  controlled  studies,  one  (AFFIRM)  conducted  in  monotherapy  in 
patients naïve to previous disease modifying treatments (patients were excluded if they had a history of 
≥ 6  months  on  interferon  or  other  prior  immunomodulatory  or  immunosuppressant  therapy)  and  the 
other (SENTINEL) conducted as add-on to Avonex, (patients had to be on Avonex treatment for at least 
one  year  and  had  to  show  active  disease  despite  this  active  treatment).  SENTINEL  was  stopped 
approximately one month early, on February 2008, because of two reports of PML.  
In  both  studies,  Tysabri  was  associated  with  a  significant  reduction  in  the  rate  of  clinical  relapse  in 
sustained progression of disability and in other MRI measures of MS disease activity. The reduction in the 
relapse rate compared to placebo at one year was 68% in monotherapy and 53% as add on to Avonex. 
The  decrease  in  the  risk  of  disability  progression,  when  compared  to  placebo  over  a  2-year  period  was 
42% in monotherapy and 24% as add on to Avonex. 
In EU, natalizumab is under additional monitoring because reports of serious adverse event represented 
by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), occurring on patients diagnosed with MS and under 
natalizumab treatment, increased with post-marketing experience and lengthening of patients’ exposure 
to Tysabri. A formal request of reviewing the benefit/risk profile of Tysabri was issued by the CHMP on 22 
October 2009 and the European Commission has consequently requested CHMP opinion in order to ensure 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 7/84 
 
  
  
the safe use of Tysabri according to a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. By the 
end of this procedure on 20 January 2010, the CHMP concluded that the benefit still outweighed the risks 
related to Tysabri treatment, but the MAH was committed to further activities for risk minimization. 
In November 2012, the application for the  extension of indication in RRMS  population  with  high disease 
activity  with  the  introduction  of  glatiramer  acetate  as  an  additional  example  of  treatment  failure  was 
endorsed  by  the  CHMP.  The  other  extension  of  indication  requested  in  November  2012  -to  Relapsing 
Remitting  Multiple  Sclerosis  (RRMS)  patients  without  high  disease  activity  and  negative  for  anti-JCV 
Antibodies - was withdrawn by the MAH in May 2013 on the basis that additional data were required and 
these were considered still provisional. 
At  the  time  of  initial  marketing  authorization  of  Tysabri  the  only  first-line  therapies  approved  for  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  relapsing  MS  were  IFN-β  and  GA.  Until  a  few  years  ago,  patients  with 
inadequate  or  insufficient  response  to  IFN-β  and  GA  were  switched  to  natalizumab  or  fingolimod 
(Gilenya), which is an oral therapy administered once daily. 
Newer  MS  drugs,  dimethyl  fumarate  (Tecfidera),  a  twice  daily  oral  capsule,  teriflunomide  (Aubagio),  a 
once  daily  oral  tablet,  and  alemtuzumab  (Lemtrada),  administered  by  intravenous  infusions,  received 
positive opinions by the CHMP recommending the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for their use in 
RRMS  population.  The  European  Commission  Decisions  on  the  Marketing  Authorisation  were  issued  in 
August and September 2013 for Aubagio and Lemtrada, and in January 2014 for Tecfidera.  
The purpose of this variation is to extend the approved indication for Tysabri, currently restricted to non-
responders  to  IFN-β  or  GA,  to  include  patients  who  are  non-responders  to  other  first-line  disease-
modifying  treatments.  The  application  is  based  on  an  interim  clinical  study  report  with  data  from  the 
Tysabri Observational Program (TOP, study IMA-06-02). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  new  clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  application,  which  was  considered  acceptable  by  the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  efficacy  of  Tysabri  in  patients  with  RRMS  has  been  established  in  2  controlled  studies,  namely, 
Studies C-1801 and C-1802 [Polman 2006; Rudick 2006]. In both studies, Tysabri was associated with a 
significant reduction in sustained progression of disability; the rate of clinical relapse; and other measures 
of MS disease activity, such as reduction in the accumulation of new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, 
gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and T1 hypointense lesions. 
Tysabri  is  currently  indicated  as  second-line  therapy  in  patients  with  highly  active  relapsing  remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and high disease  activity or those  who have failed to respond to an adequate 
course of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate (GA). At the time of the initial marketing authorisation for 
Tysabri, the only other treatment options for patients with RRMS were beta-interferons and GA. However, 
more recently an increasing number of alternative DMTs have been approved in the European Union (EU) 
for patients with RRMS e.g. fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide. However, the current 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

wording  of  the  Tysabri  indication  statement  only  allows  patients  who  continue  to  have  high  disease 
activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon or GA to switch to Tysabri. 
GCP 
The  MAH  has  provided  a  statement  that  the  observational  study  TOP  is  being  conducted  in  accordance 
with  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation  guidelines,  Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines,  local 
regulations, and recommendations contained in the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study title: Tysabri® Observational Program (TOP) 
TOP  is  an  ongoing  multinational,  multicentre,  epidemiological  observational  study  of  patients  receiving 
Tysabri, with each patient to be followed for  approximately 10 years. This study is designed to address 
the  long-term  safety  profile  and  the  long-term  effect  on  disease  activity  and  disability  progression  of 
Tysabri  with  marketed  use  and  to  provide  supportive  evidence,  in  the  absence  of  formal  switching 
studies,  for  the  effectiveness  of  Tysabri  for  patients  that  have  previously  failed  GA,  beta-interferon  and 
fingolimod. In TOP, efficacy and safety data were collected at 6-month intervals to coincide with regular 
clinic visits and routine clinical practice. 
The submitted documents cover the analyses of data on 5623 MS patients from 391 study sites based on 
a  data  cut-off  of  01  May  2014.  The  highest  proportion  of  patients  was  from  Germany  (30.3%).  The 
median  age  of the  study population  was  37  years and  the  ratio  of  female to  male  patients  was  2.57 to 
1.0. Similar demographics were seen in subgroups of patients whose last therapy before Tysabri infusion 
was glatiramer acetate, beta-interferon, or fingolimod. 
Study participants 
The study enrolled patients with RRMS, who were naïve to Tysabri at the initiation of Tysabri treatment 
and who met the criteria defined in the indication statement for prescription in their respective countries. 
Principles of enrolment into TOP were as follows: 
  Must have given written informed consent and provided all authorisations required by local law. 
  Decision to treat with Tysabri must have preceded enrolment. 
  Must have had no more than 3 Tysabri infusions prior to enrolment. 
Patient  characteristics  and  contraindications  to  treatment  with  Tysabri  in  accordance  with  prescribing 
information were as follows: 
  Documented diagnosis of RRMS. 
  Must have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year and must have satisfied the locally approved 
therapeutic indications for Tysabri. 
  Males or females whose age was within the Tysabri indication statement. 
  Must not have had a history of positive anti-natalizumab antibodies. 
  Must not have had a history of PML or other opportunistic infections, or an increased risk for such 
infections. 
  Must  not  have  received  concomitant  immunomodulatory  or  immunosuppressive  therapy  during 
therapy with Tysabri. 
  Must not have been immunocompromised at the time of enrolment. 
  Must not have been suffering from known active malignancies (patients with cutaneous basal cell 
carcinoma that has been completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible). 
  Must not have shown a known hypersensitivity to Tysabri or to any of the excipients. 
  Female  patients  must  have  been  postmenopausal  for  at  least  1  year,  surgically  sterile  (does  not 
include  tubal  ligation),  or  willing  to  practice  effective  contraception  (as  defined  by  the  treating 
physician) while receiving Tysabri. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

  Women must not have been breastfeeding or pregnant. 
Treatments 
Patients were treated with Tysabri according to the prescribing information. 
Objectives 
The objectives of TOP are to evaluate the long-term safety and impact on disease activity and progression 
of  Tysabri  as  a  single  disease-modifying  agent  in  patients  with  RRMS  in  a  clinical  practice  setting.  The 
safety of Tysabri is being assessed by collecting data on the incidence of non-MS-related serious adverse 
events (SAEs), including all serious infections, regardless of causality. The effect of Tysabri on  disability 
progression and disease activity is being assessed by using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 
and evaluating the frequency of clinical relapses. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is long-term safety (incidence and pattern of SAEs) in patients receiving Tysabri. 
Secondary Endpoints 
  MS  disease  activity  as  determined  by  the  occurrence  of  clinical  relapses  (annualised  relapse  rate 
[ARR], distribution of the total number of relapses up to 10 years, time to first relapse, proportions 
of patients with and without relapse). 
  Disability progression as determined by EDSS (based on neurological examination, “physical EDSS”). 
  Evaluation  of  baseline  disease  characteristics  as  prognostic  indicators  for  disease  activity  and 
disability progression over time. Such baseline disease characteristics include the following: 
o  EDSS 
o  disease duration at Baseline 
o  number of relapses during 1 and 2 years before Baseline 
o  previous use of DMTs 
o  age, gender, and any other characteristics available for the total population or sufficiently 
large  subgroups  to  be  defined  by  the  Study  Steering  Committee  as  putative  prognostic 
indicators to be studied  
  Evaluation of short-term (1 year) disease outcomes as prognostic indicators for disease activity and 
disability progression over time. Such short-term outcomes include the following: 
o  EDSS progression during the first 12 months 
o  occurrence of relapses during the first 12 months 
o  others to be defined by the Study Steering Committee as putative prognostic indicators to 
be studied 
Additional Endpoint 
An  additional  endpoint  for  this  study  was  the  evaluation  of  anti-JC  virus  (JCV)  antibody  prevalence  in 
patients with MS for the duration of the study. 
Sample size 
Sample size of the TOP study is not based on statistical considerations. The actual sample size is based 
on the data cut-off date of 01 May 2014.

Statistical methods 
All patients enrolled in TOP receiving at least 1 dose of Tysabri were included in the evaluation of safety 
and efficacy. 
Data were summarised by statistical characteristics (continuous data: # of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, median and range; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies). 
Patients’  baseline  information  was  summarised  and  included  demographics  (e.g.,  age  and  gender), 
disease  characteristics  (EDSS,  anti-JCV  antibody  status,  number  of  relapses,  and  MS  duration),  and 
medical history (immunomodulator or immunosuppressant use  and duration  of use).  Number of  Tysabri 
infusions  received  was  also  summarised.  Safety  was  assessed  by  incidence  of  patients  experiencing  at 
least 1 SAE. Patterns of SAEs over time were investigated. MS disease activity was assessed by: 
  ARR  
 
 
 
distribution of the total number of relapses up to 10 years  
time to first relapse 
proportions of patients with relapse 
ARR  including  its  95%  CI  was  estimated  using  a  Poisson  model  with  a  robust  covariance  matrix.  This 
analysis was repeated for different time intervals.  In  addition ARR in various subgroups was calculated. 
The time to first relapse was evaluated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, with the estimated cumulative risk 
of relapse reported at each time point of interest. 
EDSS was used to describe disease progression. Post-baseline longitudinal EDSS scores were summarised 
for  all  patients  and  subgroups  of  patients  with  baseline  and  post-baseline  data.  Time  to  sustained 
progression  and  time  to  sustained  improvement  were  both  analysed  using  Kaplan-Meier  analysis. 
Sustained progression was defined as an increase in EDSS, sustained for at least 24 weeks, of at least 0.5 
points from a baseline EDSS score ≥6.0, at least 1.0 points from a baseline EDSS score of 1.0 to <6.0, or 
at least 1.5 points from a baseline EDSS score of 0. Sustained improvement was defined as at least a 1-
point decrease in EDSS sustained for at least 24 weeks for patients with baseline EDSS scores ≥2.  
The prevalence of anti-JCV antibodies in patients with MS was estimated as the number of patients with 
anti-JCV antibodies detected by the total number of patients with reported results. Once a patient tested 
positive for anti-JCV antibodies, she/he was considered positive for the remainder of the study. 
An interim analysis was performed when the following milestones were achieved: 
-The first 500 patients completed 1 year of observation. 
-The first 1000 patients completed 1 year of observation. 
Data  analyses  were  performed  on  a  biannual  basis  thereafter.  The  results  for  this  clinical  study  report

Patient decision (4.8%) was the most common reason for withdrawal from TOP. 
  Recruitment 
The first patient was treated on January 19, 2007. Cut-off date for interim analysis was May 1, 2014 
20 December 2013. There were 391 study sites.  
  Baseline data 
Eligible patients had a documented diagnosis of RRMS, with at least 1 relapse in the previous year, and 
were naïve to natalizumab at the initiation of natalizumab treatment (must not have had >3 natalizumab 
infusions  prior  to  enrolment).  They  must  have  met  the  locally  approved  therapeutic  indications  for 
natalizumab and have made the decision to be treated with natalizumab prior to enrolment. 
Of the total patient population (n = 5623), prior to entry into this study, 547 patients (9.7%) were naïve 
to  DMTs,  5076  patients  (90.3%)  had  received  ≥1  DMTs,  and  2539  patients  (45.2%)  had  received  ≥2 
DMTs. 
Of  the  5076  patients  who  received  prior  DMT(s),  as  last  medication  prior  to  Tysabri  infusion,  3210 
patients  (57%)  received  IFN-β,  1354  patients  (24%)  received  glatiramer  acetate,  130  patients  (2.3%) 
received  fingolimod,  215  patients  (3.8%)  received  “traditional”  immunosuppressants  (mitoxantrone,

azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide,  cyclosporine,  mycophenolate,  tacrolimus,  rituximab,  methotrexate, 
cladribine), 6 patients (0.1%) received teriflunomide and 5 patients (0.1%) received dimethyl fumarate.  
As for ever received MS therapies prior to first Tysabri infusion, 4390 patients (78%) ever received IFN-β, 
1959 patients (35%) ever received glatiramer acetate, 152 patients (3%) ever received fingolimod, 777 
patients (14%) ever received “traditional” immunosuppressants. In addition, a small number of patients 
ever  used  teriflunomide  or  dimethyl  fumarate  prior  to  Tysabri  (13  and  8  patients,  respectively).  Please

Table 4 Summary of DMT Use Duration (years) Prior to Tysabri Infusion 
Sequence of treatments and duration of exposure (Patients ≥ 2 prior DMT) 
Of  the  2539  patients  that  had  received  ≥2  DMTs  prior  to  treatment  with  Tysabri  in  TOP,  the  most 
common  treatment  sequences  were  an  initial  treatment  with  interferon  beta  (1-a  or  1-b)  followed  by 
treatment  with  glatiramer  acetate  (N=535,  21%  of  patients).  The  three  most  common  treatment 
sequences  within  this  group  were:  (1)  initial  treatment  with  interferon  beta  1-a  (Rebif)  followed  by 
treatment  with  glatiramer  acetate  (Copaxone)  (N=214);  (2)  initial  treatment  with  interferon  beta  1-b 
(Betaferon or Betaseron or Extavia) followed by treatment with Copaxone (N=164); (3) initial treatment 
with  interferon  beta  1-a  (Avonex)  followed  by  treatment  with  Copaxone  (N=157).  Other  common 
sequences included switching between two different betainterferons before treatment with Tysabri, such 
as initial treatment with Avonex followed by treatment with Rebif (N=156), and switching from glatiramer 
acetate  to  beta-interferon,  prior  to  Tysabri  treatment  (N=191).  Though  less  common,  it  is  also 
noteworthy,  that  65  patients  switched  from  either  beta-interferon  or  glatiramer  acetate  to  fingolimod 
before treatment with Tysabri. 
Although the most common treatment sequences prior to Tysabri treatment comprise an initial treatment 
with  interferon  followed  by  treatment  with  glatiramer  acetate,  there  are  many  different  prior  treatment 
sequences for patients entering TOP. In some cases, patients received up to 6 or 7 DMT switches before 
entering  TOP  where  they  subsequently  received  Tysabri.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  number  of 
patients  represented  by  each  of  these  multi-DMT  treatment  sequences  is  small  and  thereby  precludes 
derivation of meaningful trends in benefit/risk. In fact, there are 293 patients who have unique treatment 
sequences in TOP. 
Update TOP efficacy data (up to 01 May 2015) 
As of 01 May 2015, only a small number of patients enrolled in the TOP study had switched from dimethyl 
fumarate  (DMF)  or  teriflunomide  to  Tysabri  (5  and  7  patients,  respectively).  The  small  size  of  these 
subgroups combined with the limited length of exposure preclude meaningful efficacy analysis. 
The pretreatment ARR of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.93, 2.03) in patients whose last therapy was GA decreased to 
0.24 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.27) while on Tysabri therapy. In patients whose last therapy was beta  interferon, 
the  pretreatment  ARR  of  1.98  (95%  CI:  1.94,  2.01)  decreased  to  0.21  (95%  CI:  0.19,  0.22)  while  on 
Tysabri therapy. 
Data is accumulating in TOP for patients who have switched from fingolimod to Tysabri. As of May 2015, 
there is adequate fingolimod to Tysabri switch data (1-3 years Tysabri treatment) related to ARR, relapse 
number  and  sustained  EDSS  progression  or  improvement,  discussed  forthwith  and  Figure  1  show  a 
summary of ARR and relapse count in patients who received fingolimod as last therapy prior to switching 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 17/84 
 
  
  
 
 
to Tysabri (n=147). For prior fingolimod patients, the mean ARR at baseline (1 year prior to the first dose 
of  Tysabri)  was  2.05;  it  decreased  to  0.41,  0.3  and  0.37  during  the  first,  second  and  third  years  of 
Tysabri treatment, respectively. During the fourth year of treatment, there was an increase in ARR to a 
mean  0.77,  though  the  sample  size  during  Year  4  was  considerably  smaller  (N=18),  and  precludes 
meaningful interpretation. 
Figure 1 ARR by Tysabri Treatment Duration in Patients with Fingolimod as Last Prior 
Therapy 
During  the  first  year  of  Tysabri  treatment,  80.3%  (57/71)  of  patients  who  received  fingolimod  as  last 
therapy  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  were  relapse-free.  During  the  second  year  on  Tysabri,  85.9% 
(61/71) of patients were reported to be relapse-free and during the third year on Tysabri, 77.3% (17/22) 
of  patient  were  reported  to  be  relapse-free.  As  of  May  2015,  the  number  of  patients  with  >3  years  of 
follow up is too small to conduct a meaningful analysis. 
The probability of confirmed EDSS worsening for patients who were on fingolimod and switch to Tysabri 
at  year  1,  2  and  3  of  treatment  were  4.17%,  11.74%  and  15.01%  respectively.  The  probability  of 
confirmed EDSS improvement for patients who were on fingolimod and switch to Tysabri at year 1, 2 and 
3  of  treatment  were  13.02%,  18.89%  and  20.92%  respectively.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  sustained 
EDSS  improvement  on  Tysabri  outweighs  the  probability  of  EDSS  worsening  for  patients  in  TOP  who 
received fingolimod as last therapy prior to switching to Tysabri.

  Numbers analysed 
5623  subjects  were  included  in  the  efficacy  evaluation.  All  of  these  subjects  had  received  at  least  one 
dose of Tysabri. 
To  estimate  the  extent  to  which  extended  interval  dosing  (EID)  might  be  present  in  TOP,  the  MAH 
examined  the treatment  exposure  in  the  subgroup who  indicated  not  receiving  Tysabri  every  month  for 
the past 6 months as compared to the subgroup that indicated receiving monthly infusions. The exposure 
characteristics  of  the  subgroup  identified  as  receiving  Tysabri  every  month  and  subgroup  that  did  not 
receive  Tysabri  every  month  were  highly  similar,  having  mean  (median)  exposures  of  29.8  (27.0)  and 
29.4 (27.0) infusions over total treatment durations of 29.4 (26.2) and 31.1 (28.5) months, respectively. 
Moreover,  the  total  person-years  of  exposure  in  the  group  that  did  not  receive  Tysabri  every  month 
divided  by  the  overall  total  person-years  of  exposure  is  0.390,  which  closely  matches  the  proportion  of 
subjects in this subgroup. Thus, subjects in the subgroup that did not receive Tysabri every month, as a 
whole,  received  a  similar  exposure  to  the  subgroup  of  patients  identified  as  receiving  Tysabri  every 
month.  These  data  demonstrate  most  of  the  patients  in  this  subgroup  were  not  consistently  receiving 
Tysabri with EID (Table 6). In fact, current data suggests that only a small percentage of patients receive 
an EID regimen.

Table  6  Exposure  to  TYSABRI  as  of  the  end  of  the  Current  Reporting  Period  by 
Tysabri Received 
A new CRF was implemented in November 2014 to collect information on dosing schedule (q4 weekly, q6 
weekly, q8 weekly or other) and infusion dates. Since introduction of this new CRF and as of May 2015, 
additional data on dosing regimen and infusion dates are available for 2198 of 5770 (38.1%) patients. Of 
these  2198  patients,  96.8%  (2127)  were  reported  as  being  on  a  Tysabri  dosing  regimen  of  q4w  while 
1.0% (23), 0.3% (7) and 1.9% (41) were  reported  to  be on a Tysabri dosing regimen of q6w, q8w, or 
other regimen, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that only 3.2% (71) of patients in TOP are 
receiving dosing other than q4w. 
Only 71 patients have contributed confirmed EID data as indicated in the new CRF and the available data 
for these  patients is limited to 7 months (from  November 2014 to May 2015). In the 71 confirmed EID 
patients  in  TOP,  over  this  limited  observation  period,  there  have  been  no  cases  of  PML  and  5  patients 
(7%) have experienced a relapse. 
TOP data on EID (in relation to Abstract presented at the American Academy of Neurology in Washington 
(Herbert et al, 2015),The MAH claimed that there were insufficient data in either source to allow for any 
conclusions on the potential for EID to mitigate PML risk while maintaining the efficacy profile of Tysabri. 
Herbert  and  colleagues  conducted  a  retrospective  analysis  of  886  patients  from  10  large  MS  Centers 
across the US who received standard dose (defined as q4w± 2days with < 2 consecutive missed monthly 
infusions) or EID of Tysabri. EID was defined as an interval ranging from 4 weeks and 3 days (q4w3d or 
31 days) to 8 weeks and 5 days (q8w5d or 61 days) for ≥ 3 consecutive doses. There were no significant 
differences  in  annual  relapse  rate,  proportion  of  patients  with  MRI  activity,  and  NEDA  (no  evidence  of 
disease activity) between the standard dose (SD) and EID groups. No  major unexpected adverse effects 
and  no  cases  of  PML  were  reported  in  the  EID  cohort  as  compared  to  2  cases  of  PML  in  the  standard 
dosing cohort. The authors concluded “1) extending the Tysabri dosing schedule to q5-8 weeks does not 
appear  to  affect  the  excellent  efficacy  profile  of  drug  as  seen  by  the  comparison  to  the  standard  dose 
cohort, and 2) although the PML trend is favorable, it has not yet achieved statistical significance. If the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

zero-PML trend continues to significance, it would support the concept of a dosing ‘safety zone’ which is 
protective of MS relapse but is also non-permissive of JC  Virus activation.”  There are, however, several 
limitations in the design of this study that prevent the results from informing on the hypothesis that EID 
can achieve comparable efficacy while reducing PML risk. 
  Outcomes and estimation 
The main objectives of this study were to determine the long-term safety and impact on disease activity 
and progression of Tysabri as a single disease-modifying agent in patients with RRMS in a clinical practice 
setting.  Safety  was  evaluated  by  incidence  and  pattern  of  SAEs.  For  further  information  please  refer  to 
Section 2.5 Clinical Safety of this AR. Efficacy evaluation is documented below. 
Annualised Relapse Rate (ARR) 
There  was  a  significant  reduction  in  ARR  for  patients  starting  on  natalizumab  therapy.  The  overall  ARR 
decreased  from  1.99  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI]:  1.96,  2.01)  in  the  pretreatment  year  to  0.22 
(95% CI:  0.21,  0.24)  while  on  natalizumab  therapy  (p < 0.0001)  and  remained  stable  over  5 years 
(Figure 2). 
Figure 2 ARR by Natalizumab Treatment Duration (Total Population) 
ARR = annualised relapse rate; CI = confidence interval; TOP = Tysabri Observational Program. 
A  significant  reduction  in  ARR  with  natalizumab  occurred  regardless  of  the  number  of  prior  DMTs 
used, with greater reductions seen in patients who were either DMT naïve or had taken only 1 DMT prior 
to dosing  with  natalizumab.  The  pretreatment  ARR of  2.07  (95%  CI:  1.99,  2.16)  in  DMT-naïve  patients 
decreased to 0.18 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.22) while on natalizumab therapy (p < 0.0001). In patients who had 
taken  1  DMT,  the  pretreatment  ARR  of  2.00  (95%  CI:  1.96,  2.04)  decreased  to  0.19  (95%  CI:  0.17, 
0.20) while on natalizumab therapy (p < 0.0001). In patients who had taken >1 DMT, the pretreatment 
ARR of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.92, 1.99) decreased to 0.27 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.29) while on natalizumab therapy 
(p < 0.0001). 
A significant reduction in ARR with natalizumab occurred regardless of the last therapy received prior 
to dosing with natalizumab (p < 0.0001). The pretreatment ARR of 1.98 (95% CI: 1.93, 2.03) in patients 
whose  last  therapy  was  GA  decreased  to  0.24  (95%  CI:  0.22,  0.27)  while  on  natalizumab  therapy.  In 
patients  whose  last  therapy  was  beta  interferon,  the  pretreatment  ARR  of  1.98  (95%  CI:  1.94,  2.01) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016

decreased  to  0.21  (95%  CI:  0.19,  0.22)  while  on  natalizumab  therapy.  In  patients  whose  last  therapy 
was  fingolimod,  the  pretreatment  ARR  of  2.06  (95%  CI:  1.88,  2.26)  decreased  to  0.38  (95%  CI:  0.28, 
0.52) while on natalizumab therapy. As  with the total population, the reduction in ARR remained stable 
over 5 years for the subgroups of patients whose last therapy prior to dosing with natalizumab was GA or 
beta  interferon.  For  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with  natalizumab  was  fingolimod,  the 
reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  3  years  (given  later  market  entry)  (Figure 3),  with  more 
variability  observed  than  in  the  other  subgroups  due  to  the  small  sample  size  (n≤130).  Data  for  the 
fingolimod subgroup after the 3 year period are less meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n≤4).

In  the  overall  study  population,  the  reduction  in  ARR  after  natalizumab  treatment  was  significant 
regardless  of  baseline  EDSS  score,  with  slightly  greater  reductions  seen  in  patients  with  lower  baseline 
EDSS scores. In patients with an EDSS score of <3, the pretreatment ARR decreased from 2.00 (95% CI: 
1.96,  2.05) to  0.18  (95%  CI:  0.17,  0.20)  while  on natalizumab  therapy  (p<0.0001).  In  patients  with a 
baseline  EDSS  score  of  ≥3,  the  pretreatment  ARR  decreased  from  1.97  (95%  CI:  1.94,  2.01)  to  0.25 
(95% CI: 0.23, 0.27) while on natalizumab therapy (p < 0.0001). 
For  the  group  of  patients  who  received  interferon  as  the  last  therapy  before  switching  to  Tysabri 
(N=695), the mean ARR during the baseline period was 1.99. After initiation of Tysabri, the ARR dropped 
dramatically and remained constant at 0.19 over the first 3 years of treatment with Tysabri, then dropped 
slightly to 0.15 in the fourth year (month 36 to 48). 
For  the  group  of  patients  who  received  Copaxone  as  the  last  therapy  before  switching  to  Tysabri 
(N=252), the mean ARR during the baseline period was 2.09. After initiation of Tysabri, the ARR dropped 
significantly after the first 12 months of treatment to 0.22, and remained low over 4 years of treatment, 
ranging from 0.19 to 0.25. 
For the group of patients who received fingolimod as the last therapy before switching to Tysabri (N=71), 
the mean ARR during the baseline period was 2.27. After 12 months of treatment with Tysabri the ARR 
dropped to 0.23. The available data is limited to 12 months of fingolimod exposure prior to Tysabri. For

Given  the  limitations  of  sample  size  and  subject-years  followed,  the  interpretation  of  these  findings  is 
limited. 
EDSS 
Mean EDSS scores were similar from Baseline (3.5) to Year 5 (3.2) in patients treated with natalizumab. 
Similar  results  were  seen  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with 
natalizumab was GA or beta interferon. For the fingolimod subgroup, mean EDSS scores were also similar 
from  Baseline  to  Year  2  (Figure 4).  Data  for  the  fingolimod  subgroup  after  the  2  year  period  are  less 
meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n≤4).

Time to Sustained EDSS Progression and Improvement 
The  time  to  sustained  progression  and  time  to  sustained  improvement  based  on  EDSS  scores  were 
analyzed  using  Kaplan-Meier  analysis.  The  cumulative  probabilities  of  sustained  progression  or 
improvement  were  estimated  for  multiple  time  points.  At  all  time  points,  the  cumulative  probability  of 
sustained improvement was higher than the cumulative probability of sustained progression (30.34% and 
19.70%, respectively, at 5.5 years). 
Similarly, the cumulative probability of sustained improvement was higher than the cumulative probability 
of  sustained  progression  at  all  time  points  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to 
dosing  with  natalizumab  was  GA,  beta  interferon,  or  fingolimod.  For  the  GA  subgroup,  the  cumulative 
probabilities  of  sustained  improvement  or  progression  at  5.5  years  were  31.43%  and  15.87%, 
respectively. For the beta interferon subgroup, the cumulative probabilities of sustained improvement or 
progression  at  5.5  years  were  29.43%  and  21.44%,  respectively.  For  the  fingolimod  subgroup,  the 
cumulative probabilities of sustained improvement or progression at 24 months were 23.02% and 5.53%, 
respectively.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study  IMA-06-02  (TOP)  is  an  observational  study  of  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis 
(RRMS)  receiving  natalizumab  as  a  single  disease-modifying  agent  in  a  clinical  practice  setting,  with 
patients followed for approximately 10 years. This  study was designed to evaluate  the  long-term safety 
profile  of  natalizumab  and  the  long-term  effect  of  natalizumab  on  disease  activity  and  disability 
progression  in  clinical  practice  for  patients  have  previously  failed  GA,  beta-interferon  and  fingolimod. 
Eligible patients had a documented diagnosis of RRMS, with at least 1 relapse in the previous year, and 
were naïve to natalizumab at the initiation of natalizumab treatment (must not have had >3 natalizumab 
infusions prior to enrolment). 
5623  MS  patients  from  391  study  sites  were  analysed  based  on  a  data  cut-off  of  01  May  2014.  The 
highest proportion of patients was from Germany (30.3%). The median age of the study population was 
37  years  and  the  ratio  of  female  to  male  patients  was  2.57  to  1.0.  Similar  demographics  were  seen  in 
subgroups of patients whose last therapy before Tysabri infusion was glatiramer acetate, beta-interferon, 
or fingolimod. 
Of the total patient population (n = 5623), prior to entry into this study, 547 patients (9.7%) were naïve 
to  DMTs,  5076  patients  (90.3%)  had  received  ≥1  DMTs,  and  2539  patients  (45.2%)  had  received  ≥2 
DMTs. 
Of the 5076 patients who received prior DMT(s), 3210 patients (57.1%) received beta interferon as their 
last  therapy  before  dosing  with  natalizumab,  1354  patients  (24.1%)  received  GA  as  their  last  therapy 
before dosing with natalizumab, and 130 patients (2.3%) received fingolimod as their last therapy before 
dosing with natalizumab. 
The patients dosed in this study received a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 29.6 (18.81) natalizumab 
infusions and a median of 27 natalizumab infusions (range: 1 to 90). Similar natalizumab exposure was 
seen  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  before  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta  interferon. 
Fewer  natalizumab  infusions  were  seen  in  the  fingolimod  subgroup,  with  a  mean  (SD)  of  14.2  (10.29) 
natalizumab infusions and a median of 13 natalizumab infusions (range: 1 to 59). Natalizumab exposure 
in the fingolimod subgroup was lower since its approval in Europe was more recent (i.e., 2011) than the 
other DMTs. 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  long-term  safety  (incidence  and  pattern  of  SAEs)  in  patients 
receiving Tysabri. The chosen efficacy endpoints included clinical relapse rate (ARR), degree of disability 
(EDSS) and evaluation of baseline disease characteristics as prognostic indicators for disease activity and 
disability progression over time. An additional endpoint for this study was the evaluation of anti-JC virus 
(JCV)  antibody  prevalence  in  patients  with  MS  for  the  duration  of  the  study.  The  chosen  endpoints  are 
considered appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
As  RRMS  is  characterized  by  unpredictable  relapses  the  evaluation  of  ARR  is  deemed  meaningful.  The 
data  from  TOP  showed  a  reduction  in  annualised  relapse  rate  (ARR)  from  baseline  at  every  time  point 
tested.  The  pretreatment ARR  (95%  Confidence  Interval  (CI)  decreased  from  1.99  (1.96,  2.01) to  0.22 
(0.21,  0.24)  on  Tysabri  therapy  (p<0.0001)  and  remained  stable  over  time.  The  effect  size  for  the 
subgroup of patients whose last therapy was fingolimod is similar to the effect sizes for the subgroups of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

patients whose last therapy was GA or beta-interferon (which serve as internal controls). 
For  all  subgroups,  treatment  with  Tysabri  significantly  decreased  the  ARR  (p  <  0.0001).  The  pre-
treatment ARR (95% CI) of 1.98 (1.93, 2.03) in patients whose last therapy was GA, decreased to 0.24 
(0.22, 0.27) during Tysabri therapy. In patients whose last therapy was all commercially available beta-
interferon, the pre-treatment ARR (95% CI) of 1.98 (1.94, 2.01) decreased to  0.21  (0.19, 0.22)  during 
Tysabri  therapy.  In  patients  whose  last  therapy  was  fingolimod,  the  pre-treatment  ARR  of  2.06  (1.88, 
2.26) decreased to 0.38 (0.28, 0.52) during Tysabri therapy.  
In  the  total  TOP  population,  the  reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  5  years  for  the  subgroup  of 
patients whose  last therapy prior to Tysabri infusion  was GA or beta-interferon. For  patients whose  last 
therapy  prior  to  Tysabri  infusion  was  fingolimod,  the  reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  2  years 
(given later market entry). Data for the fingolimod subgroup after the 2 year period are less meaningful 
due to the smaller sample size (n=22 at 3 years; n≤4 after 3 years). 
EDSS  evolution  was  used  to  assess  disease  progression.  Sustained  progression  was  defined  as  an 
increase  in  EDSS,  sustained  for  at  least  24  weeks,  of  at  least  0.5  points  from  a  baseline  EDSS  score 
≥6.0, at least 1.0 points from a baseline EDSS score of 1.0 to <6.0, or at least 1.5 points from a baseline 
EDSS score of 0. Sustained improvement was defined  as at least  a 1-point  decrease in EDSS sustained 
for at least 24 weeks for patients with baseline EDSS scores ≥2. 
Mean  EDSS  scores  were  similar  from  Baseline  (3.5)  to  Year  5  (3.2)  in  patients  treated  with  Tysabri. 
Similar  results  were  seen  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with 
natalizumab was GA or beta interferon. For the fingolimod subgroup, less meaningful conclusions may be 
drawn  due to the limited sample size  ad due to the shorter Tysabri exposure  (n=51 at year 1, n=15 at 
year 2 and n ≤4 after the 2 year period). From the limited data available, mean EDSS scores were similar 
from Baseline to Year 2. The time to sustained progression and time to sustained improvement based on 
EDSS scores were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. For the overall study population the cumulative 
probability of sustained EDSS improvement was evaluated and observed to be higher than the cumulative 
probability of sustained EDSS progression, (30.34% and 19.70%, respectively) at 5.5 years. 
Similarly,  the  cumulative  probability  of  sustained  EDSS  improvement  was  higher  than  the  cumulative 
probability of sustained EDSS progression at all timepoints for the subgroup of TOP patients whose  last 
therapy prior to Tysabri infusion was GA, beta-interferon, or fingolimod. For the fingolimod subgroup, the 
cumulative  probability  of  sustained  improvement  at  24  months  was  23.02%,  and  the  cumulative 
probability  of  sustained  progression  at  24  months  was  5.53.  For  the  GA  subgroup,  the  cumulative 
probability  of  sustained  improvement  at  5.5  years  was  31.43%,  and  the  cumulative  probability  of 
sustained  progression  at  5.5  years  was  15.87%.  For  the  beta-interferon  subgroup,  the  cumulative 
probability  of  sustained  improvement  at  5.5  years  was  29.43%,  and  the  cumulative  probability  of 
sustained progression at 5.5 years was 21.44%. Due to the open label nature of the TOP study and due 
to  the  very  high  dropout  rate,  no  conclusion  may  be  drawn  on  an  endpoint  such  as  time  to  sustained 
improvement on EDSS. 
The aim of the TOP interim analyses performed by the MAH was to demonstrate that, in a clinical practice 
setting, the type of prior treatment does not impact  the safety or efficacy profile in patients with RRMS 
who  are  subsequently  treated  with  natalizumab.  However  the  majority  of  patients  treated  with 
natalizumab  in  the  TOP  study  did  not  receive  new  DMTs  prior  to  Tysabri  treatment  and  were  mainly 
(81%) treated with either beta interferon (n= 3210, 57%) or glatiramer acetate (GA) (n= 1354, 24%) as 
last treatment prior to starting Tysabri. Fingolimod was administered, as last treatment prior to starting 
Tysabri, to only 130 patients, while very few patients received teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate prior to 
Tysabri (6 and 5 patients, respectively). Furthermore, the subgroup of patients who  received fingolimod 
as  last  therapy  before  natalizumab  was  exposed  to  a  lower  number  of  Tysabri  infusions  (mean  14.29) 
compared to the subgroups of patients whose last therapy before natalizumab was GA or beta interferon 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

(mean respectively 29 and 31 natalizumab infusions ). Results from the TOP study may thus provide only 
limited  evidence  of  similar  efficacy  of  Tysabri  when  administered  after  fingolimod.  In  addition,  both  the 
length  of  exposure  to  different  DMTs  prior  to  Tysabri  as  well  as  the  sequence  of  treatments  in  patients 
(45%)  who  have  assumed  ≥2  prior  DMTs  prior  to  the  first  Tysabri  infusion  are  currently  not  specified. 
Similarly, frequency and reasons for Tysabri discontinuation and withdrawal from TOP study according to 
different MS drugs used prior to switching to Tysabri have not been stated and discussed. An update of 
the  TOP  efficacy  data  in the  year  after  the  cut-off  date  should  be  provided  on  the  subgroup  of patients 
who previously received a DMT different from GA or IFN beta. 
Having highlighted the several limitations of the data derived from the TOP study, it is noted that overall 
efficacy data from  the interim  analysis presented  in  support of the present variation confirm the known 
efficacy profile of Tysabri and do not appear to raise new efficacy concerns.  
Of note: 
 
 
Fingolimod is indicated for the same state of disease as Tysabri (highly active RRMS)  
The current indication for fingolimod is identical to the proposed new Tysabri indication (at least 
one disease modifying therapy (DMT)). 
  Data for the fingolimod cohort are limited (N=130) 
  No data are available for patients switching from prior DMF or teriflunomide therapy to Tysabri  
  DMTs  have  different  mechanisms  of  action  compared  to  Tysabri.  Efficacy  of  Tysabri  could 
therefore be possible in patients who failed prior DMT therapy. 
The MAH argued that according to the current indication of Tysabri patients in need for treatment of their 
highly  active  RRMS  treated  with other  DMTs than  GA  and  beta-interferon  would  need  to  be  switched  to 
beta-interferon  or  GA  before  being  considered  for  treatment  with  Tysabri.  For  patients  with  moderate 
RRMS  who  started  treatment  with  teriflunomide  or  DMF  and  subsequently  experienced  a  worsening  of 
their  MS  this  would  result  in  a  prolongation  of  insufficient  (mild  to  moderate)  treatment  although  these 
patients  were  in  need  of  a  treatment  for  highly  active  disease  to  reduce  the  risk  of  exacerbations 
(relapses) and to slow the accumulation of disability. 
In principle, this argumentation can be followed and  while it is clear that the efficacy data from the TOP 
study are not adequate to clearly prove that the efficacy of Tysabri is not influenced by the type of DMT 
administered  in  the  first  line  setting,  there  is  however  no  reason  to  think  that  Tysabri  would  not  be 
efficacious after failing of different first-line DMTs. The CHMP was of the view that there was a reasonable 
scientific plausibility that even if treatment with teriflunomide and/or dimethyl fumarate failed due to lack 
of efficacy, the treatment with fingolimod would be effective. Given the current situation and the available 
therapeutic  options  in  clinical  practice,  the  CHMP  considered  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect 
separate data to be provided in patients treated with each of the marketed drugs.  
However,  the  main  concern  with  Tysabri  use  after  new  DMTs,  all  endowed  with  immunosuppressive 
properties,  is  the  increased  risk  of  PML.  A  recent  abstract  presented  at  the  American  Academy  of 
Neurology  in  Washington  (Herbert  et  al,  2015)  discussed  preliminary  data  coming  from  a  multicentre 
retrospective study of extended dosing of natalizumab in 886 patients, suggesting that increasing Tysabri 
dosing interval may be a strategy for mitigating risk of PML while maintaining efficacy. In this regard, it is 
of note that 2,211 out of 5,623 patients (39.3%) in the TOP study did not receive Tysabri every month. 
Further data have been requested on this subgroup of patients, with regard to dosing schedule, efficacy 
and safety, in order to understand if Tysabri safety profile could be favourable affected by changing in the 
schedule and if further studies addressing the issue should be required post-approval.

The MAH stated that the current request of extension of indication is not advocating earlier treatment of 
patients with Tysabri than indicated in the current approved label, and this was agreed by CHMP.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A reduction of the ARR was found following  treatment  with  Tysabri  after failure of at  least one DMT  for 
patients who failed prior therapy with GA and beta-interferon. Switching to Tysabri resulted in a reduction 
in  ARR  compared  to  the  pre-treatment  ARR.  A  similar  trend  could  be  seen  in  patients  with  prior 
fingolimod therapy even though numbers are limited. 
A further efficacy parameter in TOP was EDSS to evaluate disease progression.  Mean EDSS scores were 
similar  from  Baseline  (3.5)  to  Year  5  (3.2)  in  patients  treated  with  Tysabri.  For  the  overall  study 
population the cumulative probability of sustained EDSS improvement was evaluated and observed to be 
higher  than  the  cumulative  probability  of  sustained  EDSS  progression,  (30.34%  and  19.70%, 
respectively)  at  5.5  years.  The  EDSS  scale  has  been  questioned  in  the  past  for  its  ability  to  detect 
clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  disability.  Sustained  EDSS  as  potential  indicator  of  neurological 
improvement has been evaluated, although further research is needed to validate its use as an MS clinical 
outcome (Phillips et al, 2011).  Due to the open  label  nature of  the  TOP study and due to the  very high 
dropout rate, no conclusion may be drawn on a untested endpoint such as time to sustained improvement 
on EDSS. 
Taking into account that fingolimod and Tysabri are both indicated for highly active forms of RRMS and a 
switch  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri  showed  a  positive  trend  towards  efficacy  it  could  be  assumed  that 
patients  with  prior  teriflunomide  and  DMF  therapy  would  benefit  from  a  switch  to  Tysabri  especially  as 
these  DMTs  are  indicated  for  less  severe  forms  of  RRMS.  However,  the  TOP  study  did  not  provide  any 
efficacy  data  for  patients  switching  from  prior  teriflunomide  and  DMF  therapy  to  Tysabri  and  in  the 
absence of a control group the observed treatment effects are prone to bias and have to be interpreted 
with caution. 
The MAHs proposal to extend the indication for Tysabri is comprehensible considering the introduction of 
new  therapeutic  options  in  the  MS  treatment  over  the  past  years  and  the  corresponding  changes  to 
current MS treatment guidelines.  
Tysabri is one of the most efficacious DMTs currently available in patients  with  RRMS.  From  a biological 
perspective, there is no reason why Tysabri efficacy should be different according to the type of first line 
DMT.  Overall  the  data  presented  support  the  MAH’s  view  that  beneficial  effect  of  Tysabri  is  observed 
irrespective of initial first line treatment, even though it must be emphasized that only limited data are 
available (in terms of number of patients and time of exposure) for patients switching from fingolimod to 
Tysabri.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of Tysabri has been evaluated extensively in clinical trials, post-marketing observational 
studies and postmarketing passive surveillance. In placebo-controlled trials in 1,617 MS patients treated 
with natalizumab for up to 2 years (placebo: 1,135), adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy 
occurred in 5.8% of patients treated with natalizumab (placebo: 4.8%). Over the 2-year duration of the 
studies,  43.5%  of  patients  treated  with  natalizumab  reported  adverse  reactions  (placebo:  39.6%).  The 
highest  incidence  of  adverse  reactions  identified  from  placebo-controlled  trials  in  multiple  sclerosis 
patients  with  natalizumab  given  at  the  recommended  dose,  are  reported  as  dizziness,  nausea,  urticaria

Page 30/84 
 
  
  
and rigors associated with infusions.  
The  major  safety  concern  remains  the  risk  of  developing  PML  (and  IRIS).    As  a  safety  precaution 
physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of Tysabri therapy with the patient and provide them with 
a Patient Alert Card. 
Prior  immunosuppressants  use  was  originally  identified  as  a  risk  factor  for  PML  development  based  on 
data  from  the  global  TYGRIS  study,  which  showed  that  Tysabri-treated  patients  with  prior 
immunosuppressants  use  have  a  4-fold  greater  risk  of  PML 
than  patients  with  no  prior 
immunosuppressants  use.  Because  prior  immunosuppressants  status  was  not  available  for  all  Tysabri-
treated  patients  in  the  post-marketing  setting,  data  on  prior  immunosuppressants  use  in  the  TYGRIS 
study  was  utilized  with  the  assumption  that  it  would  be  representative  of  the  overall  Tysabri-treated 
population. Further characterization of prior immunosuppressants use on the risk of PML events following 
Tysabri administration obtained from a combined clinical study dataset from STRATA, TOP, and TYGRIS 
studies failed to identify any pattern or trend with regard to PML risk associated with type and duration of 
immunosuppressants treatment,  or length of washout  period. It is thus not possible at present to assume 
that  a 
long  washout  period  may  decrease  the  risk  of  PML  associated  with  prior  use  of 
immunosuppressants. In parallel to this assessment, at the request of the European Commission, under 
Article  20  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  a  procedure  was  started  to  assess  if,  in  view  of  existing 
evidence,  there  was  a  need  to  update  the  product  information  and/or  the  risk  management  plan,  or  to 
take  any  other  regulatory  measure  for  Tysabri  in  relation  to  PML  risk.  As  scientific  evidence  on  PML  is 
rapidly  growing,  there  was  a  need  to  assess  whether,  in  view  of  current  knowledge,  the  risk  of  PML  is 
adequately  described  and  risk  minimisation  measures  were  optimal.  The  procedure  was  finalized  in 
February 2016 and the Committees concluded that: 
 
PML which is clinically asymptomatic at diagnosis represents more frequently localised disease in 
MRI,  with  a  higher  survival  rate  and  better  clinical  outcome  as  compared  to  symptomatic  PML. 
Early diagnosis of PML appears to be associated with improved outcomes. 
  As a consequence, it was recommended that more frequent MRI screening for PML (e.g. every 3-
6  months)  using  an  abbreviated  MRI  protocol  should  be  considered  in  patients  at  higher  risk  of 
development of PML.  
 
In  patients  who  have  not  received  prior  immunosuppressant  therapy  and  are  anti-JCV  antibody 
positive, the level of anti-JCV antibody response (index) is associated with risk of developing PML. 
Current evidence suggests that risk increases with increasing antibody index but there is no clear 
cut off value. In patients treated for longer than 2 years, the risk of PML is low at index values of 
0.9 or less, and increases substantially at values above 1.5. 
 
It was recommended that patients with low anti-JCV antibody index who have not received prior 
immunosuppressant  therapy  should  be  retested  every  six  months  once  they  reach  the  2-year 
treatment point. 
 
It was considered necessary to update the existing educational material, particularly in relation to 
the risk estimates for development of PML in Tysabri-treated patients. 
Other important identified risks with natalizumab are:  
  Opportunistic infections 
In 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients, the rate of infection was approximately 1.5 per patient-
year in both natalizumab- and placebo-treated patients. The nature of the infections was generally similar 
in  natalizumab-  and  placebo-treated  patients.  A  case  of  cryptosporidium  diarrhoea  was  reported  in  MS 
clinical trials. In other clinical trials, cases of additional opportunistic infections have been reported, some 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

of  which  were  fatal.  In  clinical  trials,  herpes  infections  (Varicella-Zoster  virus,  Herpes-simplex  virus) 
occurred  slightly  more  frequently  in  natalizumab-treated  patients  than  in  placebo-treated  patients.  In 
post marketing experience, there have been reports of serious cases, including one fatal case of herpes 
encephalitis. 
 
Immunogenicity 
In 10% of patients antibodies against natalizumab were detected in 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS 
patients.  Persistent  anti-natalizumab  antibodies  (one  positive  test  reproducible  on  retesting  at  least  6 
weeks later) developed in approximately 6% of patients. Antibodies were detected on only one occasion 
in an additional 4% of patients. Persistent antibodies were associated with a substantial decrease in the 
effectiveness  of  TYSABRI  and  an  increased  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  reactions.  Additional  infusion-
related reactions associated with persistent antibodies included rigors, nausea, vomiting and flushing.  
  Hepatic events 
Spontaneous  cases  of  serious  liver  injuries,  increased  liver  enzymes,  hyperbilirubinaemia  have  been 
reported during the post marketing phase. 
An important potential risk with the use of Tysabri is malignancies (see relevant sections of the SmPC and 
of the RMP). 
In a different ongoing procedure the MAH submitted data from the Pregnancy Registry (101MS401) which 
is a category 3 MEA study listed in the Risk Management Plan.  In this procedure the MAH was requested 
to  update  Section  4.6  of  the  SmPC  with  regards  to  available  data  from  the  pregnancy  registry  and  the 
risk for transient effect on haematological parameters for newborns of mothers exposed to Tysabri during 
pregnancy.

Adverse events  
Adverse  events  associated  with  the  use  of  Tysabri  include  fatigue,  allergic  reaction,  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  anxiety,  pharyngitis,  sinus  congestion,  and  peripheral  oedema.  In  this  trial  focus  was  put  on 
the evaluation of the incidence and pattern of SAEs. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  TOP  the  safety  of  Tysabri  is  being  assessed  by  collecting  data  on  the  incidence  of  non-MS-related 
serious adverse events (SAEs), including all serious infections, regardless of causality. 
Prescribers  of  Tysabri  were  aware  of  the  possibility  that  PML  and  other  opportunistic  infections  could 
occur  during  this  therapy.  Therefore,  opportunistic  infections  were  considered  in  their  differential 
diagnosis  of  all  infections  and  any  new  or  worsening  neurological  symptoms  that  occurred  in  Tysabri-
treated  patients.  For  this  purpose,  Biogen  Idec  established  Tysabri  MS  patient  management  algorithms 
(“Physician  Information  and  Management  Guidelines  for  MS  Patients  on  Tysabri  Therapy”).  The  clinician 
evaluated  the  patient  to  determine  whether  the  symptoms  were  indicative  of  neurological  dysfunction, 
and  if  so,  whether  these  symptoms  were  typical  of  MS  or  possibly  suggestive  of  PML  or  other 
opportunistic  infections.  If  they  were  suggestive  of PML,  or  if  any  doubt  existed,  further  evaluation  was 
considered,  including  an  MRI  scan  (compared  with  MRI  prior  to  therapy),  cerebrospinal  fluid  testing  for 
JCV  DNA,  and  repeat  neurological  assessments.  If  new  neurological  symptoms  suggestive  of  PML 
occurred, further Tysabri dosing was to be suspended until PML had been excluded. Once the clinician had 
excluded PML, dosing of Tysabri could resume. 
Overall, 550 of 5623 patients (9.8%) experienced at least 1 SAE, and 197 patients (3.5%) experienced at 
least  1  SAE  that  was  considered  related  to  natalizumab.  The  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  with  the 
highest  incidence  of  SAEs  were  infections  and  infestations  (160  patients,  2.8%)  and  nervous  system 
disorders (96 patients, 1.7%). No single SAE occurred in more than 0.5% of patients. The most common 
SAEs  were  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  (30  patients  [26  confirmed  and  4 
suspected], 0.5%), hypersensitivity (26 patients, 0.5%), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
(IRIS) (20 patients, 0.4%), pneumonia (16 patients, 0.3%), spontaneous abortion (16 patients, 0.3%), 
herpes  zoster  (15  patients,  0.3%),  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  relapse  (15  patients,  0.3%),  depression  (14 
patients, 0.2%), MS (11 patients, 0.2%), and epilepsy (11 patients, 0.2%). Nineteen of 20 patients with 
IRIS also had PML.  
The SAE data for the GA and beta interferon subgroups were similar to the safety data observed for the 
total population. In the fingolimod subgroup, a lower incidence of SAEs was observed (7 of 130 patients, 
5.4%)  than  in  the  total  population  (550  of  5623  patients,  9.8%).  The  SAEs  reported  by  the  7  patients 
comprised 12 preferred terms (PTs). As in the total TOP population, the highest incidence of SAEs in the 
fingolimod subgroup was observed in the infections and infestations SOC, with 3 patients reporting SAEs 
within  5  PTs  (cystitis,  infectious  enterocolitis,  herpes  zoster,  septic  encephalopathy,  and  urinary  tract 
infection).  In  the  nervous  system  disorders  SOC,  3  patients  reported  SAEs  within  3  PTs  (dementia,  MS 
relapse, and neuralgia). The following events were also reported in 1 patient each: gastritis, neutralising 
antibodies, intervertebral disc protrusion, and spontaneous abortion. No SAE was reported in more than 1 
patient. 
The overall PML incidence rate was 4.6/1000 (95% confidence interval: 3, 6.8) based on confirmed cases 
of  PML.  The  median  number  of  natalizumab  infusions  prior  to  the  report  of  PML  (both  confirmed  and 
suspected  cases)  was  36.5,  with  number  of  infusions  ranging  from  11  to  54.  Twenty  five  of  the  30 
reported PML cases occurred in patients receiving natalizumab for more than 2 years. Anti-JC virus (JCV) 
antibody status was available for 10 of the patients with PML, and all 10 patients were anti-JCV antibody 
positive.  Eight  PML  patients  previously  used  immunosuppressants,  3  within  the  last  24  months  before

receiving natalizumab. 
Table 9 Medical History of Patients Included in TOP: History of Immunomodulator or 
Immunosuppressant  Use  and  Treatment  for  Multiple  Sclerosis  Prior  to  First  Tysabri 
Infusion (PML Patients) 
There were 60 patients (1.1%) diagnosed with a neoplasm, and 41 of these events in 39 patients (0.7%) 
were  malignant.  The  most  frequently  reported  malignancy  was  breast  cancer  (n  =  11).  Leukaemia  was 
diagnosed  in  5  patients:  2  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (CLL),  2  with  chronic  myeloid 
leukaemia,  and  1  with  acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia.  Thyroid  cancer,  renal  carcinoma  (1  patient  also 
had  CLL  and  1  patient  also  had  colon  cancer),  and  melanoma  (1  in  situ  and  1  ocular)  were  each 
diagnosed  in  3  patients.  Lung  carcinoma,  cervical  cancer  (1  in  situ),  and  colon  cancer  were  each 
diagnosed  in  2  patients.  The  other  cancer  diagnoses  (carcinoma  of  ampulla  of  Vater,  ovarian  cancer, 
testicular  cancer,  rectal  cancer,  basal  cell  carcinoma,  Waldenstrom  macroglobulinemia,  gliobastoma, 
oligodendroglioma,  chordoma,  and  bladder  cancer)  each  occurred  in  1  patient.  The  distribution  of  the 
type  of  malignancies  in  natalizumab-treated  TOP  patients  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  general 
population [Ferlay 2013]. 
Seventeen deaths (0.3% of patients) occurred during the TOP study as of 01 May 2014. Six deaths were 
attributed to suicide; 2 deaths were attributed to pulmonary embolism; and 1 death each was attributed 
to  colon  cancer,  lung  cancer,  IRIS  following  PML  (patient  had  brain  oedema),  urosepsis  (patient  had 
ongoing  PML),  autonomic  nervous  system  imbalance,  respiratory  failure  (patient  had  ongoing  PML), 
drowning, benzodiazepine overdose,  and unknown cause. With the exception of PML-related deaths, the 
reported  deaths  in  TOP  appear  to  be  consistent  with  the  fatal  events  observed  in  the  general  MS 
population.

circumstances 
Updated Safety information: Patients switching from fingolimod to Tysabri (147 patients as of May 2015; 
previously 130 patients) 
For  the  SOCs  with  the  greatest  number  of  events  overall  (e.g.,  3  events  each  in  infections  and 
infestations,  nervous  system  disorders),  the  SAE  incidence  rates  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  who 
previously  received  fingolimod  are  comparable  to  the  prior  GA  and  prior  interferon  subgroups.  The 
incidence  rates  for  SAEs  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations  in  patients  who  previously  received 
fingolimod,  GA  and  interferon  were  1.41,  1.32  and  1.19  per  100  patient  years,  respectively.  The 
incidence  rates  for  previous  fingolimod,  GA  and  interferon  subgroups  for  the  SOC  of  Nervous  system 
disorders  were  1.41,  0.84  and  0.67  per  100  patient  years,  respectively.  For  the  remaining  SOCs  which 
contained only a single SAE, the incidence rates were somewhat less similar among subgroups who last 
used  fingolimod,  GA  or  interferon.  While  subject  year  adjusted  incidence  rates  (instead  of  percentages) 
generally provides a reliable means for comparison of safety across studies of longer duration when the 
rates are stable, the SAE rates for patients last exposed to fingolimod are less stable due to the relatively 
small  sample  size  (N=147)  compared  with  the  GA  (N=1384)  and  interferon  (N=3255)  groups,  and  the 
small  number  (e.g.,  3  or  fewer)  of  events  within  each  SOC  for  patients  last  exposed  to  fingolimod.  For 
instance,  the  SOC  of  pregnancy,  puerperium  and  perinatal  conditions  for  patients  who  received  prior 
fingolimod  had  a  single  event  among  212  patient  years  which  provides  a  less  stable  estimate  of  the 
incidence (e.g., each additional event results in a greater change in the rate), as compared to the prior 
interferon subgroup which had 19 events among 8889 patient years. 
Table 11 Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) By MedDRA System Organ Class 
and  Preferred  Term  in  Descending  Frequency  for  Patients  whose  Last  Therapy  Prior 
to Natalizumab was Fingolimod 
Updated  Safety  Information:  Patients  switching  from  teriflunomide  (7  cases  as  of  01  May  2015, 
previously 6), and dimethyl fumarate (still 5 cases as before) to Tysabri. 
For the 5 patients who switched to Tysabri from dimethyl fumarate, there were no SAEs reported. For the 
7  patients  who  switched  to  Tysabri  from  teriflunomide,  one  SAE  occurred  (PT:  sepsis  and  urinary  tract 
infection). This single SAE with a PT of sepsis and urinary tract infection in the subgroup last exposed to 
teriflunomide  (subject  year  exposure  =  16  patient  years)  results  in  an  incidence  rate  of  6.21  per  100 
patient years for the infections and infestations SOC. Although this rate is greater than the incidence rate 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 36/84 
 
  
  
 
for those previously exposed to the more established DMTs of GA and interferon (1.32 and 1.19 per 100 
patient years, respectively), this likely reflects variation attributable to the relatively small sample size of 
those last exposed to teriflunomide. Therefore, the incidence rate does not appear meaningful. 
The  subgroup(s)    of  patients  in  TOP  who  last  received  treatment  with  teriflunomide  included  7  patients 
with  a  mean  and  median  exposure  to  teriflunomide  of  26.1  (±19.87)  months  and  28.2  months, 
respectively (range 4.4 to 50 months). A subset of these 7 patients also received other therapies prior to 
teriflunomide (6 patients received IFN, 3 received GA). 
The  subgroup  of  patients  enrolled  in  TOP  who  last  received  dimethyl  fumarate  prior  to  switching  to 
Tysabri  included  5  patients  with  mean  and  median  exposure  to  dimethyl  fumarate  of  13.1  (±8.04)  and 
14.2  months,  respectively  (range  4.4  to  22.9  months).  Of  these  5  patients,  a  subset  of  these  patients 
also  previously  received other  therapies  prior to  dimethyl  fumarate  (4  patients  received  IFN,  2  patients 
received GA, 1 patient received fingolimod).  
Exposure to NATALIZUMAB was based on time from first dose  to date of discontinuation/withdrawal/last 
visit,  assuming  doses  every  28  days,  and  including  NATALIZUMAB  infusions  received  prior  to  TOP 
enrollment.  Missed  doses  were  subtracted  out.  Exposure  to  Tysabri  for  patients  whose  last  medication 
was teriflunomide had a mean and median of 30.6 and 26.0 respectively (range from 1.0 to 73.0 months) 
which is similar to Tysabri exposure for patients last exposed to dimethyl fumarate (mean and median of 
31 and 36.0 respectively, range 9.0 to 52.0 months). 
In summary, the small sample size for prior teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate patient subgroups, most 
probably due to the recent approval of these DMTs and the closure date of enrollment for TOP, precludes 
meaningful  analysis.  Nonetheless,  the  data  reflect  useful  experience  to  date  for  patients  previously 
treated with these recently approved DMTs switching to Tysabri for efficacy reasons. 
Additional safety data from ongoing studies  
Spontaneously reported post marketing data collected outside the US are extremely limited as prior DMT 
use  is  not  typically  reported.  Within  the  US,  all  patients  receiving  Tysabri  are  enrolled  in  the  TOUCH 
Prescribing  Program  where  the  last  MS  therapy  received  prior  to  starting  Tysabri  is  routinely  collected. 
Therefore, the MAH has performed a review of the safety data in patients switching from other DMTs to 
Tysabri  in  TOUCH.  Regarding  TYGRIS  (Tysabri  Global  Observational  Program  in  Safety),  the  enrollment 
closed in 2009 prior to the marketing authorizations of fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and 
alemtuzumab  and  therefore  all  patients  in  TYGRIS  who  had  prior  DMT  use  before  starting  Tysabri  had 
received interferon-beta and/or glatiramer acetate. 
Review  of  Safety  Data  from  MS  Patients  Ever  Enrolled  in  TOUCH  Stratified  by  Prior  DMT  used  before 
starting Tysabri 
The Tysabri global safety database was searched for HCP confirmed serious adverse events (SAEs) from 
MS patients ever enrolled in the TOUCH Prescribing Program as of 01 May 2015. The data were stratified 
based  on  the  last  DMT  received  by  the  patient  before  enrolling  in  TOUCH  as  provided  on  the  TOUCH 
Enrollment Form. The TOUCH Enrollment Form has been updated over time to include patients switching 
from  the  newer  approved  DMTs;  however,  information  on  patients  switching  from  alemtuzumab  to 
Tysabri is not available yet as the Enrollment Form is currently in the process of being updated to include 
prior  treatment  with  alemtuzumab.  Given  the  mechanism  of  action  of  alemtuzumab  and  its  prolonged 
impact  on  immune  function,  it  is  not  anticipated  that  there  will  be  many  patients  switching  from  that 
therapy to Tysabri unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk for the patient. The current analysis from 
TOUCH  will  focus  on  safety  data  in  patients  switching  from  the  following  DMTs  to  Tysabri:  fingolimod, 
dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide. Comparison of the SAEs by MedDRA (version 18.0) System Organ

As of 01 May 2015, there were 73,968 MS patients (192,641 person-years) ever enrolled in the TOUCH 
program  since  it  started  in  June  2006.  Of  these  patients,  7,672  patients  (3.98  per  100  person-years) 
experienced  at  least  1  SAE.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  of  SAEs  were  nervous  system 
disorders  (2,438  patients,  1.27  per  100 person-years),  infections  and  infestations  (2,292  patients,  1.19 
per 100 person-years), and general disorders and administration site conditions (1,164 patients, 0.60 per 
100 person-years).The most common SAEs reported in all TOUCH patients were multiple sclerosis relapse 
(1,092 patients, 0.57 per 100 person-years), urinary tract infection (567 patients, 0.29 per 100 person-
years), and pneumonia (442 patients 0.23 per 100 person-years). 
SAEs in Patients Who Switched from Fingolimod to Tysabri 
As  shown  in  Table  12,  1,710  patients  (2,691  person-years)  switched  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri  within 
TOUCH, and of those, 97 patients (3.60 per 100 person-years) experienced at least 1 SAE. Similar to that 
reported  for  the  overall  TOUCH  population,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  of  SAEs  in  patients 
switching  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri  included  nervous  system  disorders  (31  patients,  1.15  per  100 
person-years),  infections  and  infestations  (17  patients,  0.63  per  100  person-years),  and  general 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (15  patients,  0.56  per  100  person-years).  The  most 
frequently  reported  SAEs  included  multiple  sclerosis  relapse  (16  patients,  0.59  per  100  person-years), 
multiple  sclerosis  (6  patients,  0.22  per  100  personyears),  and  death  (5  patients,  0.19  per  100  person-
years; listed as an event with cause of death unknown). 
There  was  1  confirmed  case  of  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  reported  in  a  patient 
who  switched  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri.  To  date  there  have  only  been  3  cases  of  confirmed  PML  with 
prior fingolimod exposure and of those, only 1 case was reported from the US (Case ID 2014BI037626). 
This  patient  had  received  prior  immunosuppressant  (mycophenolate  concurrently  with  IFN-beta)  before 
switching to fingolimod for approximately 2-3 years from 2011 to 2013. The patient was then switched to 
Tysabri  in  Feb  2013,  which  was  administered  concurrently  with  etanercept  for  3  months,  and  then  the 
patient received Tysabri monotherapy for the last dose received in Oct 2014. 
SAEs in Patients Who Switched from Dimethyl Fumarate to Tysabri 
There were 1,783 patients (2,691 person-years) who switched from dimethyl fumarate (DMF) to Tysabri 
within TOUCH (Table 12). Of these patients, 88 patients (3.27 per 100 person-years) experienced at least 
1  SAE.  The  SOCs  with  the  highest  frequencies  of  SAEs  were  similar  to  that  for  the  overall  TOUCH 
population and included nervous system disorders (28 patients, 1.04 per 100 person-years), followed by 
infections and infestations (18 patients, 0.67 per 100 personyears), general disorders and administration 
site  conditions,  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  and  surgical  and  medical  procedures  (10 
patients in each, 0.37 per 100 personyears). 
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  multiple  sclerosis  relapse  (11  patients,  0.41  per  100  person-

years), pneumonia (6 patients, 0.22 per 100 person-years), multiple sclerosis and urinary tract infection 
(5 patients in each, 0.19 person-years). No PML cases were reported for this subgroup. 
SAEs in Patients Who Switched from Teriflunomide to Tysabri 
Of  the  274  patients  (309  person-years)  who  switched  from  teriflunomide  to  Tysabri  within  TOUCH,  10 
patients (3.23 per 100 person-years) had at least 1 SAE. The number of patients with reported SAEs who 
had switched from teriflunomide to Tysabri is very small; however the SOCs with the highest frequencies 
of SAEs were similar to that for the overall TOUCH population and included nervous system disorders (4 
patients,  1.29  per  100  person-years),  infections  and  infestations,  and  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (3 patients each, 0.97 per 100 person-years). The most frequently reported 
SAE (reported in more than 2 patients) was multiple sclerosis relapse (3 patients, 0.97 per 100 person-
years). No PML cases were reported for this subgroup. 
PML 
As  of  01  May  2015,  there  were  35  confirmed  cases  of  PML  reported  from  the  TOP  study.  The  baseline 
demographics and characteristic of these cases are summarized in the following Table 13. 
Table  13 Baseline Demographics and Characteristics  of Confirmed PML Patients from the TOP 
Study (N = 35) 
Prior DMTs received by patients with confirmed PML in the TOP study 
Of  the  35  PML  patients  in  the  TOP  study,  33  (94.3%)  reported  prior  use  of  at  least  one  DMT  before 
initiating Tysabri. Of the 33 patients with prior DMT use, 11 patients had received ≥ 2 DMTs (33.3%).  
The  most  frequently  used  DMTs  were  interferon  beta  products  in  29  patients.  The  duration  of  prior 
interferon beta therapy in PML patients varied widely with a median of at least 26.1 months. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 40/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
There  were  11  patients  who  received  prior  glatiramer  acetate  with  a  duration  that  ranged  from  3.2  to 
81.6  months  and  a  mean and  a  median  of  25.9  and  15.3  months,  respectively.  Of  the  33  PML  patients 
who  received  prior  DMTs,  none  of  them  received  fingolimod,  dimethyl  fumarate,  teriflunomide  or 
alemtuzumab at any time prior to initiating Tysabri. 
Prior IS therapies received by patients with confirmed PML in the TOP study 
In the initial variation submission, with a data cut of 01 May 2014, the MAH reported 30 cases of PML in 
the TOP study including 26 confirmed cases and 4 suspect cases. Prior IS use was reported in 8 of these 
30  patients.  However,  2  of  these  8  patients  were  cases  of  suspect  PML  at  the  time  of  the  submission. 
Since  that time, PML was  ruled out in  one case on  03 Jun  2014 (based on  negative  CSF JCV DNA, MRI 
finding  inconsistent  with  PML  and  an  alternative  diagnosis)  and  a  second  case  was  assessed  as  low 
suspect  for  PML  (based  on  MRI  findings  suspicious  for  PML  but  CSF  JCV  DNA  that  tested  negative). 
Therefore, these two cases were not included in the updated prior IS analysis that follows. 
Based on the updated review as of 01 May 2015, of the 35 confirmed cases of PML in the TOP study, 6 
(17.1%) received prior IS therapy. As shown in Table 14, the prior IS therapies included mitoxantrone in 
4  patients,  azathioprine  in  3  patients  and  cyclophosphamide  in  1  patient.  Two  patients  received  more 
than  one  IS  therapy  including  1  patient  who  received  cyclophosphamide  and  azathioprine,  and  another 
patient who received mitoxantrone and azathioprine. One patient received 2 different treatment regimens 
of mitoxantrone (approximately 31.5 months apart). 
Table  14  Type  and  Duration  of  IS  use,  and  Washout  Period  prior  to  Tysabri  in  PML 
Patients from the TOP Study (N=6) 
Duration  and  washout  periods  of  prior  treatment  with  mitoxantrone  and  azathioprine  in  these  PML 
patients  varied  widely.  Only  1  patient  had  received  cyclophosphamide.  No  specific  pattern  or  trend  was 
identified in the small number of PML patients with regard to their prior IS use.  
Other prior therapies received by patients with confirmed PML in the TOP study 
Two  of  the  35  confirmed  PML  patients  from  the  TOP  study  reported  the  chronic  use  of  systemic 
corticosteroids  prior  to  initiation  of  Tysabri,  which  was  categorized  as  “other”  therapies  in  the  previous 
submission. Additionally, in the initial submission, a third patient (a suspect PML case) with chronic use of 
systemic  corticosteroids  prior  to  Tysabri  was  also  included  in  the  “other”  category.  This  case  is  not 
included in the current analysis since PML was assessed as a low suspect based on MRI finding suspicious 
for PML but CSF JCV that tested negative.

Duration of Tysabri therapy at the time of PML diagnosis in patients with or without prior IS use 
The mean and median durations of Tysabri received at the time of PML diagnosis in the 6 PML patients 
with prior IS use are compared with those in the 29 PML patients without prior IS use as shown in Table 
15. 
Table 15 Duration of Tysabri treatment in TOP PML patients with and without prior IS 
use (N = 35) 
The mean and median durations of Tysabri treatment at the time of PML diagnosis appear to be greater in 
patient without prior IS. 
In  the  2  PML  patients  with  no  prior  IS  use  who  had  received  chronic  systemic  corticosteroids  before 
initiation  of  Tysabri,  the  durations  of  Tysabri  treatment  at  the  time  of  PML  diagnosis  were  44  and  24 
months. 
Prior DMT, IS or other therapies use in the non-PML population in the TOP study 
As  of  01  May  2015,  there  were  5735  non-PML  patients  in  the  TOP  study.  The  majority  of  the  patients 
(5543/5735,  96.7%)  had  received  one  of  the  interferon  beta  products  prior  to  initiating  Tysabri,  which 
included  Avonex  in  1813/5735  patients  (31.6%),  Betaferon/Betaseron/Extavia  in  1671/5735  patients 
(29.1%)  and  Rebif  in  2059/5735  patients  (35.9%).  There  were  2003/5735  (34.9%)  patients  who  had 
received glatiramer acetate.  
A small number of patients had received the newer DMTs, which included fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate 
and teriflunomide (Table 16). None of the patients had received alemtuzumab prior to Tysabri.  
Table 16 Prior use of fingolimod, Dimethyl Fumarate or Teriflunomide in the non-PML 
Population from the TOP study (N=5735) 
Of the non-PML patients who had received the newer DMTs prior to the initiation of Tysabri, the duration 
of  the  washout  period  of  the  therapies  varied  with  a  wide  range.  Since  none  of  the  PML  patients  had 
received  these  newer  DMTs,  no  comparisons  can  be  made  with  regards  to  the  duration  and  washout 
periods between these 2 populations. 
There were 805 non-PML patients who had received prior IS before starting Tysabri. These  IS therapies 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 42/84 
 
  
  
 
 
included  mitoxantrone,  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide,  mycophenolate,  cyclosporin, 
tacrolimus, rituximab and cladribine. The duration and washout period for these prior IS therapies in non-
PML patients from TOP are summarized below.  
Table  17  Duration  and  washout  period  for  prior  IS  therapies  in  non-PML  patients 
from TOP 
Among the IS used by the non-PML patients, azathioprine was the most commonly used. Duration of the 
IS therapies and washout periods varied with a wide range. 
As  shown  in  Table  17  that  compares  the  type  and  duration  of  prior  IS  between  PML  and  non-PML 
patients,  there  were  3  IS  including  azathioprine,  mitoxantrone  and  cyclophosphamide  that  had  been 
received by both PML and non-PML patients.  With azathioprine, the proportion of  non-PML patients who 
had received the therapy was similar to that of PML patients (8.1% versus 8.6%). With mitoxantrone, the 
proportion of patients who had received the therapy appeared to be higher (11.4%) in PML than in non-
PML  patients  (4.6%).  However,  given  the  small  number  of  PML  patients,  whether  mitoxantrone  is 
associated with higher risk of PML cannot be  concluded. The duration of the IS therapies varied in both 
non-PML  and  PML  patients  with  a  wide  range.  No  specific  pattern  or  trend  was  identified  regarding  the 
type or duration of prior IS therapy and the occurrence of PML.

PML patients in TOP were also compared, and are shown below. 
Table  18  Comparison  of  the  washout  periods  of  prior  IS  use  in  non-PML  and  PML 
patients in TOP 
The washout periods for the 3 prior IS therapies received by non-PML and PML patients in TOP varied with 
a wide range. No specific pattern or trend was observed. 
Additionally,  there  were  299  non-PML  patients  (299/5735,  5.2%)  in  TOP  who  had  received  chronic 
systemic  corticosteroids,  71  patients  (71/5735,  1.2%)  who  had  received  prednisone,  111  patients 
(111/5735,  1.9%)  who  had  received  immunoglobulins,  and  59  patients  (59/5735,  1.0%)  who  had 
received “other” therapies prior to starting Tysabri as reported and specified by the investigators on the 
Case  Report  Form  (CRF).  These  “other’  therapies  included  DMTs  other  than  various  interferon  beta 
products, glatiramer, fingolimod, teriflunomide  and  DMF; immunosuppressive/antineoplastic medications 
other  than  those  specified  in  Table  7;  and  steroids/immunoglobulins  other  than  those  specified  on  the 
CRF. 
Potential  increased  risk/cumulative  effect  for  the  development  of  PML  in  patients  switching  from 
fingolimod and dimethylfumarate  
The MAH performed an analysis of all confirmed PML cases in Tysabri-treated patients as of 27 July 2015. 
There  were  a  total  of  580  confirmed  Tysabri-treated  PML  patients;  476  patients  had  prior  disease 
modifying therapy (DMT) status available before initiating Tysabri, of which 450 (95%) reported prior use 
of at least one DMT. Of the 450 PML cases who reported prior DMT use, 30 cases did not specify the type 
of DMT received. Of the 420 cases that provided the type of prior DMT received, all 420 cases reported 
prior interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and/or glatiramer acetate (GA), with 3 of these cases also reporting prior 
fingolimod use and no cases reporting prior use of DMF. 
The fact that all 420 PML cases with available information reported prior use of IFN-beta and/or GA is not 
surprising given that these are first line agents for the treatment of MS commonly used over the last two 
decades. Although both medications have immunomodulatory mechanisms of action, there is no evidence 
that prior use of IFN-beta or GA before switching to Tysabri is associated with a higher risk of PML. 
The  prior  MS  therapies  received  by  the  3  Tysabri-associated  PML  cases  with  prior  fingolimod  exposure 
(Case IDs 2014BI003698, 2014BI037626, and 2014BI124637) are shown below in Table 19. 
Two of the 3 PML cases (Case IDs 2014BI003698 and 2014BI124637) initially received Tysabri and then 
switched to fingolimod, and subsequently switched back to Tysabri prior to PML onset.

Comparability of the US and EU populations  
Following the request from the CHMP the MAH has also reviewed the Tysabri-treated patient populations 
in the US and the EU with regards to demographics, disease characteristics and frequency of known risk 
factors  using  data  derived  from  post-marketing  and  observational  studies.  A  comparison  of  the 
demographic  characteristics  of  US  and  EU  patient-subgroups  included  in  STRATIFY-2  (all  patients  from 
US), TOP (all patients from EU), and TYGRIS (Tysabri Global Observational Program in Safety - including 
patients  from  EU  and  US)  is  shown  in  Table  20.  The  average  age  of  Tysabri-treated  patients  in  these 
studies  is  lower  in  the  EU  patient  population  compared  to  those  in  the  US.  The  gender  distribution  in 
these  studies  appears  comparable  between  EU  and  US  patient  populations,  with  some  minor  between-
study variation. The MAH has previously shown that age and gender are not risk factors for PML using the 
proportional  hazards  model  on  Tysabri  exposure  time.  Consequently,  although  there  are  demographic 
differences  between  Tysabri-treated  patients  in  the  EU  and  the  US  based  on  these  postmarketing  and 
observational studies, the MAH believed that these differences were sufficiently small to have no impact 
on  any  conclusions  that  may  be  drawn  about  the  PML  risk  in  patients  switching  from  the  newer  DMTs 
using a US-only patient population.

Table  20  Demographic  Characteristics  in  the  US  and  EU  Populations  Based  on 
STRATIFY-2 (US), TOP (EU), and TYGRIS (US vs EU) 
Disease characteristics 
As  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  (as  measured  by  EDSS  and  ARR)  data  have  not  been  collected 
within TOUCH, a direct comparison of these characteristics between the EU and the US patient population 
within the TYGRIS study or between the TOP (all patients from EU) and the STRATIFY-2 (all patients from 
US)  studies  is  not  possible.  However,  the  MAH  has  evaluated  whether  differences  in  these  baseline 
disease characteristics impact the overall risk of PML. An assessment of data available from EU patients in 
the  TOP  and  TYGRIS  studies  (see  Table  21)  demonstrates  that  baseline  EDSS  score,  and  number  of 
relapses in  the  year  prior to  starting  Tysabri  treatment,  are  comparable  between  the  PML  and  non-PML 
Tysabri-treated patients. Regardless of PML status, patients in TOP and TYGRIS experienced a median of 
2 relapses during the year prior to Tysabri initiation. Baseline EDSS was also similar among patients with 
and without PML (median 3.0 vs 3.5; respectively). Furthermore, there is currently no available literature 
to  suggest  that  EDSS  and  ARR  at  baseline  are  risk  factors  for  PML  or  confounders  in  the  association 
between Tysabri exposure and PML. 
The MAH believed that whilst a direct comparison of the baseline disease characteristics in the EU and US 
patient  population  is  not  possible,  any  variations  that  may  exist  between  the  two  patient  populations 
should  not  contribute  to  any  differences  in  PML  risk.  Their  proposal  is  to  provide  the  necessary  safety 
data using the TOUCH patient cohort.

Table 21 Baseline EDSS in TYGRIS and TOP studies 
PML Risk Factors in US and EU Tysabri Treated Populations 
A review of the data from STRATIFY-2, TYGRIS and TOP of the three known risk factors for PML in Tysabri 
treated  patients  (positive  anti-JCV  antibody  status,  prior  immunosuppressant  use  and  duration  of 
treatment) show that there is some between-study and between-geographic variation (see Table 22). In 
particular the proportion of prior IS use recorded within the TYGRIS study is lower in the US than in EU. 
This is likely to reflect medical practice in the EU where immunosuppressants were more widely used to 
treat MS prior to the approval of Tysabri, and is not seen to the same extent in the TOP patient cohort. 
The mean and median Tysabri exposure also shows between-study variation but the range within the EU 
patient populations overlaps with the US and is broadly consistent across the two geographies.

Table 22 PML Risk Factors in the US and EU Populations based on STRATIFY-2 (US), 
TOP (EU), and TYGRIS (US and EU) 
In  summary,  it  is  clear  that  the  populations  are  not  identical  and  some  variations  exist.  However,  the 
MAH  considered  that  the  small  differences  in  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  are  unlikely  to 
impact or confound the estimated risk of PML in Tysabri-treated patients. On the other hand, differences 
between geographic regions in terms of the known risk factors of PML could be addressed by the stratified 
PML risk estimates. Stratifying adjusts the analysis to account for the known differences that impact the 
precision of the risk estimate and therefore allows valid conclusions to be drawn from the data that are 
applicable  to  all  Tysabri-treated  patients,  irrespective  of  geographical  location.  For  example,  the  risk 
estimates for anti-JCV antibody positive patients remain valid regardless of the seroprevalence rate in a 
given geographic region.  
Similarly,  the  risk  estimate  for  year  3  of  Tysabri  treatment  remains  valid  regardless  the  proportion  of 
patients  treated  for  3  years  or  more  in  a  given  geographic  region.  The  proposed  stratification  by  risk 
factors is shown in Table 23 below. This stratification of the analysis will present the PML risk estimates, 
determined  using  the  life  table  method,  by  yearly  exposure  interval  for  each  prior  DMT,  for  anti-JCV 
antibody positive patients without prior IS exposure.  
The time to PML following initiation of Tysabri treatment can also be assessed using Kaplan Meier curves 
for each prior DMT among anti-JCV antibody positive patients without prior IS exposure.

Central nervous system herpes simplex Type I and II and herpes zoster 
Cumulatively, as of 31 May 2015, a total of 4 cases of CNS herpes infections have been reported in TOP. 
From these, 2 events were caused by herpes simplex virus and 2 by varicella zoster virus. In all 4 cases, 
patients presented with typical signs and symptoms such as acute onset of fever, headache and seizures. 
In  all  4  cases,  diagnosis  was  made  by  detecting  the  viral  (VZV  or  HSV)  DNA  in  the  CSF;  2  cases  also 
reported  brain  MRIs  showing  lesions  consistent  with  herpes  encephalitis.  Treatment  for  the  event  of 
meningitis and outcome was not provided in one case (2014BI071512); in all other cases it was reported 
these  patients  recovered  upon  discontinuation  of  Tysabri  and  initiation  of  acyclovir/valacyclovir.  There 
were  three  patients  who  received  previous  MS  therapies.  From  these,  one  had  previous  exposure  to 
interferon beta 1-a, other to mycophenolate mofetil, and other to systemic corticosteroids. 
Table 24 Events Of CNS Herpes Infections by Preferred Term 
The  incidence  of  herpes  appears  to  be  higher  in  the  TOP  population  (13.27/100,000  patient-years) 
compared  to  the  estimated  incidence  of  HSV  encephalitis  worldwide  (0.22  per  100,000  person  years). 
Prior PSURs report rates were 4.9 – 5.22 per 100,000 patient-years. However, due to the limited set of 
data no definite conclusion can be drawn.  
In  the  context  of  the  evaluation  of  additional  data  submitted  in  a  different  procedure  SmPC  changes 
were endorsed to add CNS herpes simplex and herpes zoster to the list of adverse reactions.

Anemia/autoimmune haemolytic anemia 
Cumulatively  as  of  31  May  2015,  a  total of  5  cases  of  anemia  (3  non-hemolytic  and  2  hemolytic)  have 
been  reported  in  TOP.  Cases  retrieved  by  the  haematopoietic  erythropenia  SMQ  identified  cases  of 
anemia  that  are  likely  due  to  decreased  RBC  (red  blood  cell)  production  while  the  SMQ  of  haemolytic 
disorders identified those cases with possible peripheral destruction of RBCs. 
Table 25 Results from SMQ Search by Preferred Term 
Of  the  3  cases  within  the  haematopoietic  erythropenia  SMQ,  1  case  had  limited  information  for  a 
comprehensive assessment and 2 cases reported concurrent conditions likely responsible for the event of 
anemia.  Exposure  to  other  DMTs  prior  to  Tysabri  included  interferon  beta  in  2  cases;  another  case 
reported  prior 
immunoglobulin 
therapy.  There  were  no 
reports  of  previous  exposure 
to 
immunosuppressant therapies. Time between last DMT (interferons) to the first dose of Tysabri was 1 and 
4 months. 
With  regard  to  the  2  cases  identified  within  the  SMQ  of  haemolytic disorders,  one  case   presented  with 
hemolysis but without anemia. There were no laboratory results provided for markers of hemolysis (e.g. 
bilirubin  and  LDH)  with  the  exception  of  haptoglobin,  which  was  slightly  decreased.  The  diagnosis  of 
autoimmunity in this case was made based on a slightly positive direct coombs. Follow up CBC and direct 
coombs  results  were  from  tests  performed  a  year  after  the  diagnosis,  and  at  that  time,  these  were  all 
negative; the event of anemia was considered resolved. 
Despite  the  higher  rate  of  amenic  events  in  TOP  it  has  to  be  considered  that  the  incidence  rate  of 
hemolytic  anemia  in  the  overall  MS  population  (10.06  per  100,000  person-years)  is  also  higher 
compared  to  non-MS  patients  (5.45  per  100,000  person-years,  gender-adjusted:  1.85  per  100,000 
person-years). Moreover, the incidence rates of anemia and haemolytic anemia seem to be comparable 
to recent PSUR data. 
Temporal pattern of cases of anaphylaxis/anaphylactic shock and pneumonia 
17 SAEs based on the specified anaphylaxis search criteria were identified in 13 patients in the TOP study 
as of 31 May 2015. Upon medical review of the individual reports, 3 SAEs from 2 patients were excluded 
from  the  analysis.  The  remaining  14  SAEs  identified  in  11  patients  had  Preferred  Terms  (PT)  that  are 
summarized in Table 26. These events included anaphylactic reaction reported in 3 patients, anaphylactic

shock reported in 4 patients, anaphylactoid reaction reported in 3 patients, and 4 other events of chest 
discomfort, dyspnea, erythema and angioedema each reported in 1 patient. 
Table 26 Summary of the SAEs of Anaphylactic Reactions by Preferred Terms 
Last  DMT 
received  prior 
to  switching 
to  Tysabri 
included 
interferon-beta 
in  7  patients: 
(Betaferon/Betaseron/Extavia in 4 patients, Avonex in 2 patients, and Rebif in 1 patient) and glatiramer 
acetate  in  2  patients.  Additionally,  the  use  of  an  IS  (mitoxantrone)  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was 
reported  in  1  patient  and  the  use  of  chronic  systemic  corticosteroids  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was 
reported in another patient. 
For 7 of 11 patients, the anaphylactic reactions occurred within approximately 30 minutes after the start 
of  the  Tysabri  infusion;  in  4  of  11  patients,  the  specific  time  of  the  anaphylactic  reaction  and  the 
relationship to the Tysabri infusion was not provided. All 11 patients recovered from the event. 
The incidence rate for anaphylactic reactions in TOP was estimated to be 0.2% (11 out of 5,770 patients) 
and is comparable to incidence rates in Tysabri clinical trials. 
Pneumonia 
33  SAEs  based  on  the  specified  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  search  criteria  were  identified  in  32 
patients in  the  TOP  study  as  of  31  May  2015.  Upon  medical  review of  the  individual  reports,  8  SAEs  in 
which there was no confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 25 
SAEs identified in 24 patients had Preferred Terms (PT) that are summarized in Table 27.

Table 27 Summary of the SAEs of Pneumonia by Preferred Terms 
Baseline  demographics  and  characteristics  are  available  for  24  patients  with  pneumonia  from  the  TOP 
study.  The  last  DMT  received  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  included  interferon-beta  in  16  patients: 
(Avonex  in  3  patients,  Rebif  in  4  patients,  Betaferon/Betaseron/Extavia  in  9  patients),  and  glatiramer 
acetate  in  4  patients.  Additionally,  the  use  of  an  IS  (mitoxantrone)  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was 
reported  in  1  patient,  and  the  use  of  immunoglobulins  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  was  reported  in 
another patient. In 2 patients, no prior DMT or IS therapy was reported. 
Causality  was  assessed  as  “Related”  in  9  cases,  “Possible”  in  3  cases,  “Unrelated”  in  11  cases,  and  not 
provided  in  2  cases.  Outcome  was  reported  as  “Recovered”  in  20  cases,  “Recovered  with  sequelae  in 1 
case, “Not recovered” in 3 cases, and “Fatal” in 1 case. 
To  further  assess  the  association  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (LRTI)  in  patients  with  MS  and 
specifically  in  those  treated  with  Tysabri,  the  MAH  conducted  an  insurance  claims  study  (Mini-Sentinel, 
modular  program  3)  using  data  from  01  Jan  2004  through  31  Dec  2012.  The  results  are  presented  in 
Table 12 and report the incidence rate (and incidence rate ratio) for LRTI among the following groups: 1) 
All MS patients; 2) MS patients on any disease modifying therapy (DMT); 3) MS patients on DMTs other 
than Tysabri; 4) MS patients treated with Tysabri; 5) MS patients never treated with a DMT.

Infection from Claims study 
Malignancies 
A  search  of  the  global  Tysabri  safety  database  was  performed  on  31  May  2015  using  the  SMQ 
(Standardized MedDRA Query) of malignant tumors (MedDRA version 18.0). The search yielded a total of 
39 cases with 41 events. 
All  39  cases  reported  a  primary  site  for  the  malignancy;  in  addition  to  this  primary  site,  two  cases 
(2012BI040805  and  2011BI000789)  had  associated  metastatic  events  also  coded  within  the  case  (1 
metastatic  event  per  case)  accounting  for  the  41  total  events.  For  the  TOP  malignancy  incidence  rates 
and  analysis,  only  primary  tumors  were  included  leaving  a  total  of  39  events.  Among  the  reported 
malignancies in TOP, breast cancer  was the  most  common, affecting 12 patients (all female). Leukemia 
was diagnosed in 5 patients: (acute promyelocytic leukemia (1 patient), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (2 
patients)  and  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (2  patients).  Thyroid  cancer  was  also  diagnosed  in  5  patients; 
colon cancer in 4 patients; lung cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma were diagnosed in 2 patients each; 
these include one cervical and one melanoma cancer in situ. All other cancers (skin, brain, non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma [NHL], bladder, kidney, and liver/biliary) occurred in one patient each. 
Investigator  causality  was  assessed  as  unrelated  in  29  cases,  unlikely  related  or  possibly  related  in  2 
cases each, and related in 5 cases; causality was not assessed in 1 case. The outcome was provided in 38 
of  the  39  cases.  Of  these,  the  outcome  was  not  recovered/not  resolved  for  20  patients, 
recovered/resolved  for  12  patients,  recovered  with  sequelae  in  4  patients,  and  fatal  in  2  patients.  See 
Appendix  A  for  a  summary  of  the  case  characteristics  for  the  reported  malignancies  in  TOP.  The  fatal 
malignancy cases are described in more detail later in this response. 
In 9 cases, the Investigator reported that the patients did not have risk factors for the malignancy or a 
family  history  of  malignancy,  and  in  24  cases,  it  was  unknown  if  the  patients  had  risk  factors  as  no 
information was provided.  
Prior treatment with DMTs (disease modifying therapies) before starting Tysabri included interferon beta 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 53/84 
 
  
  
 
 
(19  patients)  and  glatiramer  acetate  (12  patients);  some  patients  received  more  than  one  prior  DMT. 
There  were  no  reports  of  patients  who  received  the  newer  DMTs  (e.g.  fingolimod,  dimethylfumarate, 
teriflunomide)  before  Tysabri  and  then  developed  a  malignancy.  In  addition,  1  patient  had  received 
CDP323  in  a  clinical  trial;  CDP323  is  an  oral  α4-integrin  inhibitor  no  longer  in  development.  Other 
treatments  received  prior  to  starting  Tysabri  in  these  patients  included  immunoglobulins  and  chronic 
systemic  steroids.  There  were  no  patients  who  reported  receiving  immunosuppressants  (IS)  as  the  last 
therapy before initiation of Tysabri; however, 5 cases did have a history of prior IS use. Of these, 4 cases 
reported  the  use  of  one  IS  therapy  (cychophosphamide,  azathioprine  or  mitoxantrone)  while  one  case 
reported 
the  use  of 
three  prior 
IS 
therapies 
(azathioprine,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  and 
cyclophosphamide). 
The 2 malignancy cases with a fatal outcome involved the following events: Colon cancer metastatic  and 
lung neoplasm malignant . 
There  were  two  cases  of  melanoma  reported  in  TOP.  These  cases  corresponded  to  events  of  ocular 
melanoma  and  in  situ  melanoma.  There  were  no  cases  reported  of  invasive  skin  melanoma.  Onset  of 
melanoma in these cases was after 14 and 35 infusions for each case, respectively. 
There was one case of lymphoma reported in the TOP study. 
There  were  five  cases  of  leukemia  reported  in  TOP.  Two  were  reports  of  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia 
(CLL), two were reports of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and one was a report of acute promyelocytic 
leukemia. Time to onset in these cases ranged from 9 to 31 infusions with a mean of 21.8 and a median 
of 21 infusions. 
Cumulative  incidence  rates  for  malignancies  in  TOP  stratified  by  gender  were  compared  to  the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) incidence rates in the general population. 
Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis 
The MAH performed a medical review of the 8 SAEs of pulmonary embolism (PE) including the 2 fatal PE 
cases,  and  the  5  SAEs  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  reported  from  the  TOP  study.  The  MAH  also 
performed a search of the Tysabri global safety database to identify any additional cases of PE and DVT 
from the TOP study captured under the MedDRA (version 18.0) SMQ of "Embolic and Thrombotic Events” 
as of 31 May 2015. The search identified 2 additional cases of PE, but no new cases of DVT. Narratives on 
the 2 fatal cases of PE, and available data for the SAEs of PE and DVT from the TOP study as of 31 May 
2015 are provided below. 
Pulmonary embolism 
There were 10 patients with the reported event  of  PE. Baseline demographics and characteristics of the 
10 patients with PEs are summarized in the Table 29 below.

The  Table  30  below  provides  the  severity,  comorbidities,  concomitant  medications,  outcome,  and 
Investigator causality for the 10 patients with PEs in the TOP study.

Table 30 Severity, comorbidities, concomitant medications, outcome and Investigator 
causality for cases of PE in the TOP study 
As shown in the Table 30 above, risk factors for thromboembolic disease were present in all 10 patients 
with a PE. These risk factors included history or concurrent DVT (3 patients), superficial vein thrombosis 
or  thrombophlebitis  (3  patients),  lower  limb  venous  insufficiency  (1  patient),  history  of  malignancy  (2 
patients), bone fracture with surgical repair (1 patient), use  of contraceptives (2 patients) and smoking 
history (1 patient). Severity of the PE was assessed by the Investigator as moderate in 5 patients, severe 
in 2 patients and not reported in 3 patients. Causality was assessed as unrelated by the Investigator in all 
cases. Six of the 10 patients with PEs recovered from the event, and 2 patients recovered with sequelae. 
There were 2 patients with a fatal outcome. Narratives of these 2 fatal PE cases are provided below. 
First case 
A  50-year-old  female  patient  from  the  Czech  Republic  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  was 
enrolled in the TYSABRI Observational Program (IMA-06-02) and received 2 doses of Tysabri (300 mg IV 
QM)  on  06  Apr  2011  and  09  May  2011.  She  experienced  a  PE  and  died  on  14  Oct  2011  at  home, 
approximately  5  months  after  her  last  dose  of  Tysabri.  Per  the  autopsy  report  performed  on  an 
unspecified  date,  the  cause  of  death  was  PE,  which  was  assessed  by  the  Investigator  as  unrelated  to 
Tysabri treatment. The patient’s expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and Karnofsky scores were not

reported.  Medical  history  included  Grawitz  tumor  of  the  right  kidney  (grade  III)  diagnosed  on  25  Aug 
2011,  and  a  nephrectomy  of  the  right  kidney  was  performed  on  12  Sep  2011.  It  was  unknown  if  the 
patient  had  a  history  of  cigarette  smoking.  No  concomitant  medications  were  reported.  Prior  therapies 
received before starting Tysabri included unspecified  chronic systemic corticosteroids received from  Nov 
2008 to Mar 2011, glatiramer acetate received from Mar 2009 to Mar 2010 and interferon beta-1a (Rebif) 
from Mar 2010 to Mar 2011. 
Second case 
A  54-year-old  female  patient  from  the  Czech  Republic  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  was 
enrolled in the TYSABRI Observational Program (IMA-06-02) and received 15 doses of Tysabri (300 mg IV 
QM) from 16 Oct 2009 to 21 Dec 2010. Five months after her last dose of Tysabri, she was hospitalized 
on 21 May 2011 due to a pathological fracture of the right humerus and had osteosynthesis performed on 
22 May 2011. She experienced a PE and sudden  death on 28 May 2011. No autopsy was reported. The 
Investigator assessed the event of PE as unrelated to Tysabri treatment. 
The  patient’s  EDSS  and  Karnofsky  scores  were  not  reported.  Relevant  medical  history  included  colon 
carcinoma  with  liver  metastasis  diagnosed  on16  Mar  2011(reported  in  Case  ID  2011BI018797).  It  was 
unknown  if  the  patient  had  a  history  of  cigarette  smoking.  No  concomitant  medication  was  reported. 
Previous  therapies  received  before  starting  Tysabri  included  chronic  systemic  corticosteroids  from  Jul 
2009 to Sep 2009 for unknown indications. 
Deep Vein Thrombosis 
There  were  5  patients  with  the  reported  event  of  DVT  in  the  TOP  study,  including  1  case  that  also 
reported a PE (Case ID 2012BI017603). Baseline demographics and characteristics of the 5 patients with 
DVTs are summarized in the Table below. 
Table  31  Baseline  Demographics  and  Characteristics  of  the  patients  with  DVTs  (N  = 
5) 
Table  32  provides  the  severity,  co-morbidities,  concomitant  medications,  outcome,  and  Investigator 
causality for the 5 patients with DVTs in the TOP study.

Page 57/84 
 
  
  
 
 
Table  32  Severity,  co-morbidities,  concomitant  medications,  outcome  and 
Investigator causality for cases of DVT in the TOP study 
As  shown  in  Table  32,  risk  factors  for  thromboembolic disease  were  present in  3  of  the  5  patients  with 
DVT.  The  risk  factors  included  use  of  contraceptives  (2  patients)  and  use  of  an  anti-HIV  drug  (Kaletra) 
known  to  be  associated  with  DVTs  (Kaletra  Prescribing  Information,  2013).  Severity  of  the  DVT  was 
assessed by the Investigator as severe in 2 patients, moderate in 2 and mild in 1. Outcome of the event 
at the time of the SAE report was “Recovered” in 1 patient, “Recovered with sequelae” in 2 patients, and 
“Not recovered” in 2 patients. The event was assessed as unrelated in 4 patients and as possibly related 
in 1 patient by the Investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
Anti-JC virus (JCV) antibody status was available for 10 of the patients with PML, and all 10 patients were 
anti-JCV antibody positive. 
Safety in special populations 
As  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  is  only  related  to  prior  disease  modifying  therapies  the  target 
population remains the same with regards to age. 
Elderly  
Whilst the Clinical Trial safety database contains adequate patient numbers to assess any effect of gender 
or  age  up  to  55  years  on  the  safety  profile,  there  are  inadequate  numbers  of  patients  over  this  age  to 
determine the safety profile in this older group of patients. 
Pediatric population 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 58/84 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Only  a  small  number of  adolescents  and  children  have  been  studied.  Therefore,  safety  in  the paediatric 
population  has  not  been  established,  although  an  open-label  repeat-dose  PK  and  safety  study  in 
paediatric patients aged 10 to less than 18 years old has been agreed with the Paediatric Committee at 
the  EMA  in  relation  to  the  paediatric  investigation  plan  for  natalizumab.  The  last  patient  completed  this 
study in June 2014. 
Pregnant or breast feeding women 
Immunohistological  studies  indicate  natalizumab  binds  to  the  placenta  and  foetal  tissues,  indicating  a 
potential  for  teratogenic  and/or  abortifacient  activity.  A  reproductive  toxicology  study  evaluating  the 
effects of natalizumab demonstrated no fetotoxicity or drug-related teratogenic effects. 
The  Tysabri  pregnancy  exposure  registry  initially  enrolled  376  women  with  pregnancies  exposed  to 
Tysabri  and  outcome  data  from  355  completed  pregnancies  were  obtained.  There  were  316  live  births 
with  birth  defects  being  reported  in  29  of  these  infants.  An  additional  birth  defect  was  detected  in  a 
pregnancy which ended in elective termination. The rate of major birth defects in infants born to subjects 
with MS or CD exposed to Tysabri in the Registry was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.2%, 11.4%). The birth defects 
were  reviewed  at  the  end  of  the  study  by  an  Advisory  Committee  of  external  experts  in  relevant 
specialities  of  teratology,  epidemiology  and  maternal  and  foetal  medicine.  The  Advisory  Committee 
determined  that  16  infants  had  defects  which  met  criteria  used  by  the  Metropolitan  Atlanta  Congenital 
Defect Program (MACDP), the comparator for the study, and the Committee’s definition of major defects. 
These 16 infants from 317 pregnancies (316 live births plus defect in one elective termination) reflect a 
birth  defect  rate  of  5.05%  (95%  CI:  2.9%,  8.1%).  While  this  rate  is  higher  than  that  reported  in  the 
MACDP (2.67%), the Advisory Committee did not observe patterns of defects that were suggestive of an 
unusual distribution and found no specific signals of concern.  
There  were  32  spontaneous  abortions  reported  in  the  pregnancy  registry.  The  spontaneous  abortion 
reporting  rate  among  the  339  completed  pregnancies  enrolled  into  the  registry  prior  to  22  weeks 
gestation  was  9.4%  (95%  CI:  6.6%,  13.1%)  which  is  comparable  to  background  rates  of  15%-17% 
reported in the general population in the literature. (Anokute 1987, Ventura 2009). 
Among the 840 serious adverse events reported for female patients in the TOP study as of May 1, 2015, 
there were a total of 25 events in 22 patients coded to the MedDRA (version 18.0) Preferred Term (PT) of 
spontaneous abortion. 
The  25  spontaneous  abortions  (SA)  included  2  patients  with  multiple  SA  events  (one  patient  with  2 
reports of SA and one patient with 3 reports of SA). Maternal age for these SA events ranged from 22  – 
36 years (mean and median of 30.6 and 31, respectively). The distribution of events by country included 
11 SA events reported from Germany, 6 from the Czech Republic, 2 from the Netherlands, and 1 for each 
of the following countries: Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom. 
Five of the 22 patients did not have prior  disease modifying therapy (DMT) reported. Of the 17 patients 
who  reported  prior  treatment  with  one  or  more  DMTs,  all  but  one  of  these  patients  received  prior 
interferon-beta and/or glatiramer acetate, and one patient received prior fingolimod.

Table 33 Gestational age at Last Exposure to Tysabri and at Outcome for Pregnancies 
in TOP Resulting in Spontaneous Abortion (n=25) 
Further detail on the Tysabri exposure in pregnancies that resulted in spontaneous abortion is provided in 
Table 34. The mean Tysabri exposure was similar for the SA events in which the last exposure to Tysabri 
occurred  prior  to  conception  and  those  in  which  the  last  exposure  to  Tysabri  occurred  at  less  than  8 
weeks of gestation; however, the median exposure varied. 
Table 34 Mean and median Tysabri Exposure in Women whose Pregnancies Resulted 
in Spontaneous Abortion in TOP (n=25) 
There were 215 pregnancies in the TOP study based on the number of pregnancies reported during the 
follow  up  visit.  The  rate  of  spontaneous  abortions  in  TOP,  using  the  number  of  reported  pregnancies  in 
the  denominator,  is  25/215  or  11.6%.  This  rate  is  consistent  with  the  rate  of  spontaneous  abortions 
estimated from the following populations: 
1.  Tysabri Pregnancy Registry (9% for all pregnancies and 15.9% for those pregnancies enrolled in the 
Registry prior to week 22 of gestation) (101MS401 CSR EMEA/H/C/000603/II/0074), 
2.  MS populations treated with glatiramer acetate and interferon beta (10 to 17% Alwan et al 2015; 
Coyle et al 2003, Coyle et al 2013, Richman et al 2012; Sandberg-Wollheim 2011) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

3.  General population (15.9 to 17%, Anokute 1987; Ventura 2009). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 2104 subjects discontinued Tysabri (37.4%). Among those 2104 patients discontinued Tysabri, 
1246 patients stayed on study, 855 withdrew from TOP, and 3 discontinued Tysabri after withdrew from 
TOP  as  of  the  date  cut-off.  131  patients  (2.3%)  discontinued  due  to  Non-Serious  Adverse  Events,  62 
patients (1.1%) discontinued due to Serious/Other Serious Adverse Event. 
The overall rate of complete withdrawal from  the study was 21.3%. For comparison the discontinuation 
rates in other EU registries such as Sweden, Austria and Denmark in 2014 were reported to be 48%, 38% 
and 42%, respectively. 
The 5 most common reasons for discontinuation of Tysabri, in order of descending frequency were: 
1.  positive anti-JCV antibody status (14.1% of patients enrolled) 
2.  patient decision (7.7% of patients enrolled) 
3.  medication change (7.0% of patients enrolled) 
4. 
insufficient efficacy (6% of patients enrolled) 
5.  physician decision (4.6% of patients enrolled) 
The 5 most common reasons for withdrawal from TOP, in order of descending frequency were: 
1.  patient decision (4.8% of patients enrolled) 
2. 
lost to follow up (3.1% of patients enrolled) 
3.  medication change (3.0% of patients enrolled) 
4.  withdrawal of consent (2.8% of patients enrolled) 
5.  positive anti-JCV antibody status (2.7% of patients enrolled) 
The  reasons  for  discontinuation  and  the  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinue  Tysabri  treatment 
appeared to be similar across groups and independent of the previous DMT used before initiating Tysabri 
treatment 
Post marketing experience 
Natalizumab  is  available  in  USA  and  all  EU  markets.  In  addition  the  drug  is  also  approved  in  Australia, 
New  Zealand,  Canada,  Israel,  India,  Russia,  Switzerland,  Japan  and  some  Middle  East,  North  African, 
South  American  and  South  East  Asian  countries.  In  USA  the  drug  is  also  approved  for  the  indication 
Crohn’s Disease.  
With  regards  to  identified  and  potential  risks  several  safety  postmarketing  actions  have  been  initiated 
which include conduct of  clinical trials, MS Re-dosing  protocol, TOUCH  Surveillance  Programme, TYGRIS 
Observational  Cohort  Study  and  a  Pregnancy  registry.  Furthermore  local  country  specific  registries 
(Sweden,  Denmark,  Italy,  France,  Austria,  Ireland)  are  being  performed  in  Europe,  with  the  majority 
being run by independent investigators.  
As a result risk minimisation measures have been implemented, e.g. Updates to SmPC, Package Leaflet 
and Educational Guidance, Revisions to the Patient Alert Card and Implementation of Treatment Initiation

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  TOP  study  patient  population  was  generally  well  balanced  between  the  subgroups  with  regard  to 
patient and disease characteristics. 
The  MAH  presented  data  from  an  interim  analysis  (up  to  01  May  2015)  to  update  the  current  safety 
dataset. However, the updated safety data did not significantly increase the relevant safety dataset, likely

due  to  the  closure  date  for  enrollment  from  TOP  (December  2013,  except  for  Mexico  and  the  Czech 
republic  where  enrollment  continues)  compared  to  the  recent  EMA  marketing  authorization  for  the  new 
DMT  [Teriflunomide  (August  2013);  Dimethyilfumarate  (January  2014);  Alemtuzumab  (September 
2013)]:  the  number  of  patients  who  switched  from  teriflunomide  to  Tysabri  increased  from  6  to  7;  the 
number of patients who switched from dimethyl fumarate to Tysabri remained 5; the number of patients 
who  switched  from  fingolimod  to  Tysabri  increased  from  130  to  147.  The  total  person-years  of  Tysabri 
exposure in the subgroup of patients who switched from fingolimod increased from 135.56 to 212. There 
were  no  subjects  enrolled  in  TOP  with  previous  exposure  to  alemtuzumab.    For  the  SOCs  with  the 
greatest number of SAEs  (infections and infestations and in nervous system)  3 events each occurred in 
the  fingolimod  subgroup.  SAEs  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and  Infestations  in  patients  who  previously 
received fingolimod, GA and interferon were 1.41, 1.32 and 1.19 per 100 patient years, respectively. The 
incidence rates for the SOC of Nervous system disorders were 1.41, 0.84 and 0.67 per 100 patient years, 
respectively.  For  the  remaining  SOCs  which  contained  only  a  single  SAE,  the  incidence  rates  were 
somewhat less similar among subgroups who last used fingolimod, GA or interferon. 
For the 5 patients who switched to Tysabri from dimethyl fumarate, there were no SAEs reported. For the 
7  patients  who  switched  to  Tysabri  from  teriflunomide,  one  SAE  occurred  (PT:  sepsis  and  urinary  tract 
infection). This single SAE with a PT of sepsis and urinary tract infection in the subgroup last exposed to 
teriflunomide  (subject  year  exposure  =  16  patient  years)  results  in  an  incidence  rate  of  6.21  per  100 
patient years for the infections and infestations SOC. Although this rate is considerably greater than the 
incidence  rate for those  previously exposed to  GA and  interferon (1.32  and  1.19 per  100 patient years, 
respectively), it is acknowledged that due to the small sample size of those last exposed to teriflunomide 
it is not possible to draw conclusions on this comparison. 
The distribution of the type of malignancies as well as the rate of spontaneous abortions in natalizumab-
treated TOP patients was in general comparable to that observed in a general population.  
In the initial submission, with a data cut of 01 May 2014, the MAH reported 30 cases of PML in the TOP 
study including 26 confirmed cases and 4 suspect cases. Based on the updated review as of 1 May 2015, 
35  confirmed  cases  of  PML  have  been  reported  from  the  TOP  study.  None  of  the  35  confirmed  PML 
patients in TOP received fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide or alemtuzumab at any time prior 
to  initiating  Tysabri.      However  –due  to  the  limited  exposure  to  these  new  DMTs  in  the  overall  TOP 
population - this provides only very limited reassurance.  
Safety findings were generally consistent with the current safety profile of Tysabri.  
However, only a limited group of MS patients (147) in the TOP study received fingolimod prior to Tysabri 
and  only  7  and  5  patients  were  treated  with  teriflunomide  and  dimethyl  fumarate  prior  to  Tysabri, 
respectively. 3.8% of patients (n=215) received “traditional” immunosuppressants (mitoxantrone, n=77, 
azathioprine,  n=  90,  cyclophosphamide,  n=24)  as  last  treatment  prior  to  starting  Tysabri.  The  small 
number  of  patients  and  the  low  natalizumab  exposure  to  new  DMTs  prevents  a  conclusive  safety 
evaluation.  
As potential source of additional safety data in patients switching from other disease modifying therapies 
(DMT)  to  Tysabri  the  MAH  identified  the  TOUCH  prescribing  program  in  the  US  and  proposed  that  data 
from  it  be  used.  The  MAH  provided  data  on  SAEs  by  SOC  and  by  PT  listed  for  the  overall  TOUCH 
population  (73.968  patients,  total  person  years  of  Tysabri  exposure:  192.641)  and  for  the  subgroup  of 
patients  who  switched  from  fingolimod  (1.710 patients,  total  person  years  of  Tysabri  exposure:  2.691), 
for  the  subgroup  who  switched  from  Dimethyl  fumarate  (1.783  patients,  total  person  years  of  Tysabri 
exposure: 2.691) and for the subgroup of patients who switched from Teriflunomide (274 patients, total 
person years of Tysabri exposure: 309). 
TOUCH  data  provide  only  a  rough  safety  estimate  as  no  information  has  been  provided  with  regard  to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 62/84 
 
  
  
patient  and  disease  characteristics,  thus  it  is  unknown  whether  the  patient  population  is  balanced 
between subgroup with regard to patient and disease characteristics.  
The  incidence  density  of  at  least  1  SAE  was  similar  in  the  Overall  TOUCH  population  (3.98  per  100 
patients-years)  and  in  the  subgroups  according  to  prior  DMT  (switched  from  fingolimod:  3.60  per  100 
patients-years;  switched  from  dimethyl  fumarate  3.27  per  100  patients-years;  switched  from 
teriflunomide 3.23 per 100 patients-years). 
The  incidence  density  of  SAEs  by  SOCs  in  the  subgroups  of  patients  who  switched  from  fingolimod  or 
from  Dimethyl  fumarate  do  not  seem  to  exceed  those  of  the  overall  TOUCH  population;  the  Applicant 
states that the incidence of SAEs by SOC in the subgroup of patients who switched from teriflunomide is 
less  comparable  due  to  due  to  the  relatively  small  sample  size  (N=274)  compared  to  the  overall  TOP 
population (N=73.968) and the small number of events (4 or fewer) of events within each SOC and this is 
acknowledged.  
The comparison of SAEs by PT in the three above mentioned subgroups compared to the overall TOUCH 
population is difficult due to the small number of events within each PT in the prior fingolimod, dimethyl 
fumarate and teriflunomide subgroups, thus no conclusions may be drawn.  
The  major  safety  concern  elicited  by  the  therapy  with  new  DMTs,  all  endowed  with  immunosuppressive 
activity, prior to switching to Tysabri is the occurrence of opportunistic infections, and above all the risk 
of developing PML. 
Indeed  PML  cases  have  been  recently  recorded  also  in  patient  treated  with  fingolimod  and  dimethyl 
fumarate containing products, independently of Tysabri exposure. 
Post  marketing  data  indicate  that  PML  occurs  in  about  0.1/1000  in  JCV  negative  patients  treated  with 
natalizumab and ranges from 1 to 11/1000 in JCV positive patients according to treatment duration and 
prior  immunosuppressant  use.  In  addition,  natalizumab  withdrawal  because  of  progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy almost always triggers an immune reconstitution  inflammatory syndrome that may 
lead to neurological complications or even death. 
35  PML  confirmed  cases were recorded  in the TOP study.  6  patients  (17.1%) received  prior IS  therapy. 
The  prior  IS  therapies  included  mitoxantrone  in  4  patients,  azathioprine  in  3  patients  and 
cyclophosphamide in 1 patient. Two patients received more than one IS therapy including 1 patient who 
received  cyclophosphamide  and  azathioprine,  and  another  patient  who  received  mitoxantrone  and 
azathioprine.  One  patient  received  2  different  treatment  regimens  of  mitoxantrone  (approximately  31.5 
months  apart).  None  of  the  35  PML  patients  in  TOP  received  prior  fingolimod,  dimethyl  fumarate  or 
teriflunomide at any time prior to initiation of Tysabri. 
Of  the  35  confirmed  PML  patients  in  the  TOP  study,  25  patients  (71.4%)  had  anti-JCV  antibody  testing 
performed  prior  to  the  PML  diagnosis  and  all  tested  positive;  3  patients  had  anti-JCV  antibody  tested 
positive at an unspecified time; and 7 PML patients did not have available anti- JCV antibody test results. 
In  these  7  PML  patients  (all  from  the  EU),  the  diagnosis  of  PML  occurred  before  the  anti-JCV  antibody 
assay became commercially available in the EU. 
As  a  risk  minimization  measure  for  PML,  the  MAH  proposed  to  insert,  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC, 
information on the need to consider the half-life and mode of action of the previous DMT when switching 
patients  from  another  DMT  to  Tysabri,  in  order  to  avoid  an  additive  immune  effect  whilst  at  the  same 
time minimising the risk of disease reactivation.  Furthermore, the MAH proposed to list the 5 specific IS 
therapies  (mitoxantrone,  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  cyclophosphamide  and  mycophenolate  mofetil) 
used more frequently among PML and non-PML Tysabri-treated patients in the TOP, TYGRIS and STRATA 
studies. A Complete Blood Count is recommended prior to initiating Tysabri to ensure that immune effects 
of  the  previous  therapy  (i.e.  cytopenia)  have  resolved.  As  alemtuzumab  has  a  profound  prolonged 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 63/84 
 
  
  
immunosuppressive  effect  and  as  the  actual  duration  of  these  effects  is  unknown,  initiating  treatment 
with Tysabri after alemtuzumab will not be recommended. 
In principle, the proposed risk minimization measures are deemed appropriate. However, for the moment 
it  is  unknown  whether  use  of  new  DMTs  with  an  immunosuppressive  mechanism  of  action  prior  to 
switching to Tysabri is associated with the same increased PML risk as “traditional immunosuppressants”. 
Indeed,  complete  safety  information  on  a  rare  event  such  as  PML  may  be  acquired  only  with  post 
marketing clinical experience over years, and thus it is impossible to evaluate and quantify at present the 
added risk of new DMTs to the development of PML following Tysabri exposure.  
As  acknowledged  by  the  Applicant  in  previous  PSURs,  the  available  information  on  prior  IS  use  in  the 
overall Tysabri treated population and in confirmed PML cases is very limited. The limited data available 
do not allow to identify any pattern or trend with regard to PML risk and the specific types of IS therapies. 
In this regard, the addition of 5 specific IS therapies in the SmPC and Educational  material is considered 
inappropriate. 
Based on the available PSUR data (coming from STRATA, TOP and TYGRIS), no specific pattern or trend 
on  duration  of  the  wash-out  period  for  “traditional  immunosuppressants”  therapy  prior  to  Tysabri  has 
been observed. PML risk appears to be present with both short and long wash-out periods.  
In line with these previous findings, the TOP data submitted for this variation show that the frequency of 
ever  prior  “traditional  immunosuppressants”  use  in  PML  patients  enrolled  in  the  TOP  study  was  26.7%, 
compared  to  13.8%  in  the  overall  TOP  population.  Conversely,  the  frequency  of  “traditional 
immunosuppressants” use as last therapy prior to switching to Tysabri was similar between PML patients 
(3.3%)  and  overall  TOP  population  (3.6%).  At  present,  this  is  accounted  for  in  the  Tysabri  SmPC  by  a 
dedicated warning in section 4.4. 
It is at present not known if ever prior use of new DMTs is a risk factor for PML occurrence after Tysabri 
treatment  independently  of  the  time  at  which  the  exposure  occurred.  The  proposed  risk  minimisation 
measures (to consider the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy in order to avoid an additive 
immune effect) are endorsed. However, it is currently unknown if these measures are sufficient  to avoid 
an increased PML risk in patients treated with new DMTs. Furthermore, lymphocyte cell count alone may 
not be a sufficient risk minimisation measure. Also number and/or function of lymphocyte subsets may be 
important for immune function recovery to occur. Only future additional data coming from post-marketing 
activities will allow to determine whether further specific risk minimization measures will be necessary for 
instance to better evaluate patients’ immunocompetence status.  
The MAH provided on request from the CHMP a comparative analysis on the similarity between US and EU 
patients on Tysabri. The comparison provided by the MAH of the US and EU patient-subgroups included in 
STRATIFY-2  (all  patients  from  US),  TOP  (all  patients  from  EU)  and  TYGRIS  (patients  from  EU  and  US) 
showed  some  differences  in  demographic  characteristics  between  EU  and  US  patient  population; 
furthermore,  between-study  and  between-geographic  variation  was  observed  for  the  three  known  risk 
factors  for  PML  in  Tysabri  treated  patients  (positive  anti-JCV  antibody  status,  prior  immunosuppressant 
use  and  duration  of  treatment),  in  particular  for  the  proportion  of  prior  IS  use  in  the  TYGRIS  EU 
population.  A  direct  comparison  of  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  in  the  EU  and  US  patient 
population  is  not  possible  from  available  data,  as  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  (as  measured  by 
EDSS and ARR) data have not been collected within TOUCH 
In  light  of  the  higher  number  of  patients  with  prior  IS  use  and  anti-JCV  antibodies  in  the  TYGRIS  EU 
population  and  considering  that  differences  in  PML  incidences  between  EU  and  US  patients  have  been 
observed in the past it is considered mandatory to also include patients with prior IS use in the planned 
analysis.  This  will  also  allow  for  the  investigation  of  a  potential  cumulative  risk  for  PML  in  patients  with 
prior IS use switching from newer DMT’s to Tysabri. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 64/84 
 
  
  
In  conclusion,  the  comparability  of  EU  and  US  patients  was  not  fully  demonstrated.  The  MAH  plans  to 
assess the feasibility of including EU data.  
Regarding the  strategy  proposed by the MAH  to collect  post-authorisation safety  data  relying mainly on 
the  TOUCH  program  mainly  data  from  US  patients  will  be  used  to  assess  the  PML  risk  for  patients 
switching  from  newer  DMT’s  to  Tysabri.  In  order  to  assess  infrequent  events  such  as  PML  and  other 
opportunistic infections in patients switching from the newer DMTs, the  MAH has proposed to undertake 
an  observational  cohort  study  utilizing  all  available  data  fields  collected  within  the  Tysabri  TOUCH 
prescribing program in the US. However, collection of data beyond the dataset agreed with the FDA (e.g. 
EDSS,  ARR),  is  not  feasible  in  this  cohort  because  the  MAH  does  not  unilaterally  control  the  TOUCH 
program which is carried out in conjunction with the FDA. This is a prospective study which will include all 
TOUCH MS patients and will run for a period of 8 years, with an anticipated end-date of 2023.  
Additionally  the  MAH  should  also  commit  to  review  the  feasibility  of  including  EU-patient  data  utilising 
existing registries, and should this be unfeasible, commit to set up a dedicated registry in the EU, in order 
to  address  the  issue  of  missing  data  from  EU  patients.    Even  though  it  is  acknowledged  that  this  will 
require  additional  time  to  set-up,  it  is  considered  mandatory  to  gain  safety  data  in  the  long  term  in 
European Tysabri-treated patients switching from a new DMT. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Tysabri evaluated in TOP did not show major differences regarding SAEs (incidence, 
type, frequency), malignancies or PML incidence rates compared to the currently known safety profile of 
Tysabri.  Safety  findings  were  consistent  within  the  subgroups.  The  lower  incidence  of  SAEs  observed  in 
the  fingolimod  subgroup  compared  to  the  total  population  could  be  a  result  of  the  lower  exposure  to 
natalizumab  in  this  subgroup.  However,  the  overall  safety  of  Tysabri  after  the  use  of  new  DMTs  is  at 
present  incompletely  characterized  mainly  because  of  the  limited  number  of  patients  who  received 
fingolimod  treatment  prior  to  Tysabri  and  to  the  extremely  low  number  of  patients  who  received 
teriflunomide  or  dimethyl  fumarate,  the  short  Tysabri  exposure  after  fingolimod  treatment,  the  lack  of 
data on duration of exposure to first-line DMTs.  
Currently  PML  represents  the  main  safety  concern  for  treatment  with  Tysabri  also  with  regards  to  a 
possible increase in the frequency of PML events due to the sequential use and possible cumulative effect 
of new DMTs with immunosuppressive activity and Tysabri. In this regard it has to be mentioned that PML 
cases have also been reported for DMF and fingolimod. However, due to the recent approval status only 
limited data are currently available on the risk for PML with these drugs.  
Adequate  information  on  the  limited-absence  of  data  for  patients  switching  from  new  DMTs  to  Tysabri 
should be provided in the SmPC for the prescriber.  
As  long  as  conclusive  data  are  not  available,  patients  with  prior  use  of  another  DMT  with  an 
immunosuppressive effect, in a conservative approach must be considered as having a PML risk equal to 
patients  who  received  immunosuppressants  prior  to  receiving  Tysabri.  This  information  should  be 
adequately reflected in the SmPC, Physician Information and Management Guidelines. 
Since safety information on a rare event such as PML may be acquired only with post marketing clinical 
experience  over  years,  the  Applicant  committed  to  collect  post-authorisation  safety  data  on  Tysabri 
treatment  in  MS  patients  who  were  previously  treated  with  at  least  one  DMT  including  teriflunomide, 
dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, fingolimod.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
The CHMP adopted changes to the existing indication as follows:  
“TYSABRI is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in adults with highly active relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups: 
 
Adult Patients aged 18 years and over with highly active disease activity despite a full 
and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 72/84 
 
  
  
 
(DMT) (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 
and 5.1) a beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate.  
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Patients should 
have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 
T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 
Gadolinium-enhancing lesion. A “non-responder” could also be defined as a patient with an 
unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous 
year. 
or 
 
Adult Patients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more 
Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as 
compared to a previous recent MRI”. 
Additionally and as a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
To support the change to the approved indication for Tysabri, efficacy data are derived from the ongoing 
Tysabri  Observational  Program  (TOP),  an  observational  study  of  patients  receiving  Tysabri,  through  an 
interim Clinical Study Report using a cut-off date of May 1, 2014.  
In the overall TOP population, ARR decreased from 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.96, 2.01) in the 
pretreatment  year  to  0.22  (95%  CI:  0.21,  0.24)  while  on  natalizumab  therapy  (p  <  0.0001)  and 
remained stable over 5 years. A significant  reduction  in  ARR  with natalizumab occurred in patients who 
were either DMT naïve, had taken only 1 DMT or had taken >1 DMT prior to dosing with natalizumab (p < 
0.0001),  with  greater  reductions  seen  in  patients  who  were  either  DMT  naïve  or  had  taken  only  1  DMT 
prior to dosing with natalizumab.  
When looking at the three subgroup of patients  with  interferon,  glatiramer  acetate or fingolimod as last 
therapy  received  prior  to  natalizumab,  in  all  three  subgroups  there  was  a  significant  reduction  in  ARR 
while on natalizumab treatment compared to pretreatment year (GA subgroup ARR decreased from  1.98 
in the pre-treatment year to 0.24 while on natalizumab therapy; beta interferon subgroup ARR decreased 
from 1.98 to 0.21; fingolimod subgroup ARR decreased from 2.06 to 0.38; p<0.0001). 
For  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to  dosing  with  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta 
interferon  the  reduction  in  ARR  remained  stable  over  5  years.  For  patients  whose  last  therapy  prior  to 
dosing with natalizumab was fingolimod, the reduction in ARR remained stable over 2 years. Data for the 
fingolimod subgroup after the 2 year period are less meaningful due to the smaller sample size (n=22 at 
3 years; n≤4 after 3 years). 
Mean EDSS scores were similar from Baseline (3.5) to Year 5 (3.2) in the overall TOP population patients 
treated with natalizumab. Similar results were seen for the subgroups of patients whose last therapy prior 
to  dosing  with  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta  interferon.  For  the  fingolimod  subgroup,  less  meaningful 
conclusions may be obtained due to the limited sample size ad due to the shorter Tysabri exposure (n=51 
at year 1, n=15 at year 2 and n ≤4 after the 2 year period). From the limited data available, mean EDSS 
scores were similar from Baseline to Year 2. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  majority  of  patients  treated  with  natalizumab  in  the  TOP  study  received  as  last  treatment  prior  to 
starting Tysabri either beta interferon (n= 3210, 57%) or glatiramer acetate (GA) (n= 1354, 24%); only 
a small subgroup of patients received fingolimod (n=130, 2.3%); very few patients received teriflunomide 
or  dimethyl  fumarate  (6  and  5  patients,  respectively);  215  patients  (3.8%)  received  “traditional” 
immunosuppressants (mitoxantrone, n=77, azathioprine, n= 90, cyclophosphamide, n=24). Furthermore, 
the  subgroup  of  patients  who  received  fingolimod  as  last  therapy  before  natalizumab  was  exposed  to a 
lower  number  of  Tysabri  infusions  (mean  14.29)  compared  to  the  subgroups  of  patients  whose  last 
therapy  before  natalizumab  was  GA  or  beta  interferon;  (mean  29  and  31  natalizumab  infusions, 
respectively). In particular, only 21 patients out of 130 (16%) were exposed to Tysabri for >24 months.  
No  efficacy  data  have  been  provided  for  patients  switching  from  other  DMTs  (teriflunomide,  DMF)  to 
Tysabri  but  efficacy  of  Tysabri  could  be  expected  due  to  disease  related  indication  for  these  drugs

(teriflunomide, DMF for mild to moderate RRMS, Tysabri for highly active disease). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  TOP  study  was  designed  as  a  safety  non-interventional/  observational  study.  No  data  have  been 
provided  from  a  randomized  controlled  clinical  trial  to  support  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  for 
Tysabri. 
On the basis of available data coming from the observational TOP study, in a small subgroup (n=147) of 
patients  treated  with  fingolimod  prior  to  switching  to  natalizumab,  the  Applicant  stated  that  safety 
findings were generally consistent regardless if the patient’s last therapy before natalizumab infusion was 
GA, beta-interferon or fingolimod.  
The  incidence  density  of  at  least  1  SAE  was  similar  in  the  Overall  TOUCH  population  (3.98  per  100 
patients-years)  and  in  the  subgroups  according  to  prior  DMT  (switched  from  fingolimod:  3.60  per  100 
patients-years;  switched  from  dimethyl  fumarate  3.27  per  100  patients-years;  switched  from 
teriflunomide  3.23  per  100  patients-years).  However,  the  incidence  density  of  SAEs  by  SOCs  in  the 
subgroups  of  patients  who  switched  from  teriflunomide  is  less  comparable  due  to  the  relatively  small 
sample size and the small number of events (4 or fewer) of events. 
 The major safety concern with natalizumab treatment is the risk of developing PML, as reflected by the 
35  PML  cases  that  occurred  in  TOP  study.  Among  risk  factors  for  PML  there  is  the  previous  use  of 
immunosuppressive  drugs.  The  new  DMTs  are  all  endowed  with  immunosuppressive  activity  and  thus 
may increase the risk of PML following Tysabri especially for patients switching from fingolimod and DMF. 
Moreover,  PML  cases  have  been  reported  both  in  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  as  well  as  after  the 
administration of dimethyl fumarate containing products, independently of Tysabri exposure.  
Of  the  35  confirmed  cases  of  PML  in  the  TOP  study,  6  (17.1%)  received  prior  IS  therapy.  The  prior  IS 
therapies  included  mitoxantrone,  azathioprine  and  cyclophosphamide.  None  of  the  35  confirmed  PML 
patients in TOP received fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide or alemtuzumab at any time prior 
to  initiating  Tysabri.  However  –due  to  the  limited  exposure  to  these  new  DMTs  in  the  overall  TOP 
population this provides only very limited reassurance. 
Among  important  Tysabri  potential  risks,  there  is  the  occurrence  of  malignancies.  In  the  TOP  interim 
analysis there were 60 patients (1.1%) diagnosed with a neoplasm, and 41 of these events in 39 patients 
(0.7%)  were  malignant.  Further  data  with  longer  exposures  are  needed  in  order  to  assess  whether  the 
use of other DMT with an immunosuppressive effect prior to switching to Tysabri are associated with an 
increased risk of malignancies. This issue will need discussion in upcoming PSURs. 
In  the  TOP  study  there  were  two  deaths  due  to  pulmonary  embolism,  a  total  of  8  SAEs  of  pulmonary 
embolism, and 5 SAEs of deep vein thrombosis.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The Applicant updated safety data from the TOP study (last interim analysis up to 1 May 2015). However, 
these  safety  data  did  not  significantly  increase  the  relevant  safety  dataset.  TOP  data  include  only  a 
limited number of patients (147) who switched from fingolimod to Tysabri, followed up for a relative short 
time  (212  person-years  of  exposure).  Only  7  patients  included  in  TOP  switched  from  teriflunomide  to 
Tysabri and only 5 switched from  dimethyl  fumarate  to Tysabri.  As potential source  of additional safety 
data in patients switching from other disease modifying therapies (DMT) to Tysabri the MAH identified the 
TOUCH prescribing program in the US.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 75/84 
 
  
  
It is at present not known if differences exist between “traditional” immunosuppressants and “new DMT”- 
endowed  with  immunosuppressive  activity  as  risk  factors  for  the  occurrence  of  PML  events  following 
Tysabri  administration.  Currently,  no  conclusive  safety  data  for  patients  switching  from  other  DMTs 
(teriflunomide, DMF, fingolimod) to Tysabri are available. 
Due  to  the  variability  in  duration  and  washout  periods  of  prior  traditional  immunosuppressants  use 
between the PML and non-PML TOP population no conclusions may be drawn on this comparison. 
Weight was not collected in TOP, thus the MAH is unable to provide data regarding the weight of patients 
with PML 
Present  data  do  not  allow  for  comparison  of  the  frequency  and  type  of  malignancies  observed  in 
natalizumab-treated  TOP  patients  with  those  occurring  in  the  patient  population  with  MS  of  comparable 
age  not  treated  with  natalizumab.  Further  data  with  longer  exposures  are  needed  in  order  to  assess 
whether  the  use  of  other  DMT  with  an  immunosuppressive  effect  prior  to  switching  to  Tysabri  are 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  malignancies.  Further  post-authorisation  safety  data  should  be 
collected.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Efficacy  of  Tysabri  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  past  and  is  supported  by  the  TOP  study.  Treatment 
options for patients with highly active RRMS are limited. Efficacious treatment is important in this patient 
population. Insufficient therapy can lead to an increase of relapse rates and disabilities. The possibility of 
switching to Tysabri after only one DMT could contribute to the patient’s benefit. 
Currently, the indication of Tysabri is limited to patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate 
course  of  IFN-β  or  GA.  The  MAHs  proposal  to  extend  the  indication  for  Tysabri  is  comprehensible 
considering the introduction of new therapeutic options in the MS treatment over the past years and the 
corresponding changes to current MS treatment guidelines.  
From  a  biological  perspective,  there  is  no  reason  to  suspect  that  Tysabri  efficacy  should  be  different 
according to the type of first line DMT. Thus the administration of Tysabri after any first line DMT would 
allow a larger number of MS patients to benefit from the treatment with a very efficacious drug.  
Safety  information  on  a  rare  event  such  as  PML  may  be  acquired  only  with  post  marketing  clinical 
experience over years, so, at present, it is not possible to definitely evaluate the risk of PML for new MS 
DMTs or  to  quantify the potential increase in PML  events following administration of different DMTs and 
Tysabri.  
Conclusive  data  for  patients  with  prior  use  of  recently  approved  DMT  switching  to  Tysabri  are  currently 
limited/  not  available.  Consequently,  estimation  of  the  PML  risk  for  these  patients  is  not  possible. 
Therefore,  patients  with  prior  use  of  these  DMT  must  be  considered  and  treated  as  having  a  PML  risk 
equal to patients with prior use of immunosuppressants.  
Adequate  information  on  the  limited/absence  of  data  for  patients  switching  from  new  DMTs  to  Tysabri 
should be provided in the SmPC for the prescriber. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  clinical  course  of  RRMS  is  characterized  by  a  high  inter-individual  variability.  A  subset  of  patients 
presents with severe disease activity, defined by a high load of active lesions and frequent relapses that 
are very likely to progress to sustained disability with all related complications. If these patients show an 
inadequate response to a first-line therapy the treating physician should have the possibility to administer 
a second-line treatment such as Tysabri, after careful consideration of the individual benefit/risk balance.  
Conversely,  there  is  also  a  subset  of  MS  patients  for  whom  sequential  courses  with  more  than  one 
disease  modifying  agent  could  be  reasonably  considered  before  starting  a  second-line  therapy  with  a 
worse safety profile. This is correctly reflected in the wording of the indication which states after “at least 
one”  disease  modifying  treatment.  Because  of  its  safety  profile,  Tysabri  should  be  used  when  other 
treatments are viewed as not appropriate or inefficacious, on a case by case basis.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 79/84 
 
  
  
 
 
The main safety concern that the use of Tysabri after treatment with new DMTs generates is the potential 
increase in PML frequency due to the fact that previous treatment with “traditional” immunosuppressants 
is  a  known  risk  factor  for  PML  occurrence.  Due  to  the  rarity  of  PML  further  information  may  only  be 
acquired  with  post  marketing  clinical  experience  over  years  and  the  MAH  committed  to  systematically 
gather additional data on the safety of Tysabri treatment in MS patients who were previously treated with 
at least one DMT including teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, fingolimod.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
DMTs like GA, beta-interferon, teriflunomide and DMF are first line treatment options for mild to moderate 
forms of RRMS. In case of disease worsening DMTs are usually insufficient and these patients are in need 
for  more  effective  treatment  options.  For  patients  with  highly  active  RRMS  these  options  include 
natalizumab.  In  the  past  efficacy  of  Tysabri  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  treatment  of  highly  active 
RRMS. TOP provided additional efficacy data (ARR, EDSS) for patients with prior GA, beta-interferon and 
fingolimod therapy although for the latter the dataset is limited. 
Although  data  on  the  efficacy  of  Tysabri  after  failure  of  first-line  treatment  with  the  newest  DMTs  were 
limited they were considered sufficient. Moreover it was recognized by the CHMP, that given the current 
situation,  and  the  available  therapeutic  options  in  clinical  practice,  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect 
separate  efficacy  data  to  be  provided  in  patients  treated  with  each  of  the  marketed  drugs  before 
switching to Tysabri.  
However,  the  main  safety  concern  elicited  by  the  sequential  therapy  of  new  DMTs,  all  endowed  with 
immunosuppressive  activity,  and  Tysabri  is  the  occurrence  of  infections,  and  above  all  the  risk  of 
developing  PML.  Indeed  PML  cases  have  been  recently  recorded  also  in  patient  treated  with  fingolimod 
and  dimethyl  fumarate  containing  products,  independently  of  Tysabri  exposure.  A  recent  abstract 
presented  at  the  American  Academy  of  Neurology  in  Washington  (Herbert  et  al,  2015)  suggested  that 
increasing Tysabri dosing interval may be a strategy for mitigating risk of PML while maintaining efficacy. 
In  this  regard,  it  is  of  note  that  about  40%  of  patients  in  the  TOP  study  did  not  receive  Tysabri  every 
month. 
A Complete Blood Count is recommended prior to initiating Tysabri to ensure that immune effects of the 
previous  therapy  (i.e.  cytopenia)  have  resolved.  As  alemtuzumab  has  a  profound  prolonged 
immunosuppressive  effect  and  as  the  actual  duration  of  these  effects  is  unknown,  initiating  treatment 
with TYSABRI after alemtuzumab is not recommended  unless the  benefits clearly outweigh the risks for 
the individual patient. 
In general, it is agreed that in case of sequential use of new DMTs and Tysabri, information in the SmPC 
on how to avoid additive immunosuppression is needed. However, up to now it is unknown whether new 
DMTs with an immunosuppressive mechanism of action are associated with the same increased PML risk 
as  “traditional  immunosuppressants”  when  administered  prior  to  Tysabri.  Indeed,  complete  safety 
information  on  a  rare  event  such  as  PML  may  be  acquired  only  with  post  marketing  clinical  experience 
over years, and thus it is impossible to evaluate and quantify at present the added risk of new DMTs to 
the  development  of  PML  following  Tysabri exposure.    The  limited  data  available do  not  allow  to  identify 
any  pattern  or  trend  with  regard  to  PML  risk  and  the  specific  types  of  IS  therapies.  In  this  regard,  the 
addition  of  specific  recommendations  with  regard  to  specific  prior  immunosuppressant  therapies  in  the 
SmPC of Tysabri and the Educational material is considered inappropriate. 
Based on the available PSUR data (coming from STRATA, TOP and TYGRIS), no specific pattern or trend 
on  duration  of  the  wash-out  period  for  “traditional  immunosuppressants”  therapy  prior  to  Tysabri  has 
been observed. PML risk appears to be present with both short and long wash-out periods. 
As  long  as  more  complete  data  are  not  available,  patients  with  prior  use  of  another  DMT  with  an 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/579064/2016 
Page 80/84 
 
  
  
immunosuppressive  effect  should  be  considered  as  having  a  PML  risk  equal  to  patients  who  received 
immunosuppressants prior to receiving Tysabri.  
The Applicant committed to systematically gather additional data on the safety of Tysabri treatment in MS 
patients  who  were previously  treated  with  at  least one  DMT  including  teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate, 
alemtuzumab, fingolimod. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Tysabri 
As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC were updated in order to provide physicians with 
more options for treating RRMS patients with high disease activity who fail a full and adequate course of 
treatment with disease modifying therapy (DMT). Consequential changes were also introduced in sections 
4.2, 4.3, 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 18.

The physician information about TYSABRI shall contain the following key elements: 
 
That TYSABRI therapy is to be initiated and continuously supervised by specialised physicians 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions, in centres with timely access 
to MRI. 
 
Information that atypical/opportunistic infections, in particular PML, may occur with TYSABRI and 
include: 
o 
That the risk of PML increases with increasing duration of treatment and that treatment 
beyond 24 months carries additional risk Other factors associated with an increased risk for 
the development of PML 
 
Presence of anti-JC virus antibodies 
  Level of the antibody response (index) for patients without a history of 
immunosuppressant treatment 
 
Immunosuppressant treatment prior to the use of Tysabri 
o A stratification of the risk of developing PML based on the identified risk factors and presentation of 
the PML risk in a given time interval of treatment as well as the cumulative PML risk 
o Diagnosis and prognosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic PML 
o 
o 
o 
o 
PML management algorithm 
Possibility of other opportunistic infections 
The recommendation that patients should have MRI scans at the following times

 
 
Within 3 months prior to starting TYSABRI 
Annually during treatment with TYSABRI 
 
More frequent MRIs (e.g. on a 3 to 6 monthly basis) for patients at high risk for 
PML. 
 
At the first sign of any symptoms indicative of the possibility of PML. 
Description of MRI protocols for baseline, routine screening and in case of PML suspicion 
Anti-JCV antibody testing, frequency of testing, interpretation of qualitative and quantitative results, 
seroprevalence of JCV-antibodies and seroconversion rate over time 
Monitoring strategy after discontinuation of TYSABRI treatment 
o 
The need to inform patients about the benefits and risk of TYSABRI and provide them with: 
 
 
A copy of the treatment initiation form  
A patient alert card including a core text agreed by the CHMP 
o 
If treatment is to be continued for longer than 24 months, the need to inform patients about 
the increased risk of PML and provide them with a copy of the treatment continuation form 
o Possibility of other opportunistic infections 
o 
The need to inform the National Competent Authority about any cases of PML 
 
Information about the following adverse reactions: 
o 
Infusion reactions 
o  Hypersensitivity reactions 
o  Antibody formation 
 
Information about any registry or other monitoring system set up in the Member State and how to 
enter patients 
The treatment initiation form should contain the following elements: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That  the  aim  of  the  treatment  initiation  form  is  to  provide  patients  with  information  on  PML  and 
IRIS  
Information  on  PML  and  IRIS  including  the  risk  of  developing  PML  during  Tysabri  treatment 
stratified by prior treatment with immunosuppressants and JC virus infection.  
Confirmation  that  the  doctor  has  discussed  the  risks  of  PML  and  the  risk  of  IRIS  if  treatment  is 
discontinued following suspicion of PML  
Confirmation of patient understanding of the risks of PML and that they have received a copy of the 
form and a patient alert card  
Patient details, signature and date  
Prescriber name, signature and date 
Date treatment started  
The treatment continuation form should contain the elements of the treatment initiation form and, in 
addition, a statement that the risks of PML increase with duration of treatment and that treatment 
beyond 24 months carries additional risk.

5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Tysabri 
As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the SmPC were updated in order to provide physicians with 
more options for treating RRMS patients with high disease activity who fail a full and adequate course of 
treatment with disease modifying therapy (DMT). Consequential changes were also introduced in sections 
4.2, 4.3, 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

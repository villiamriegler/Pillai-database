PART VI:  Summary of Risk Management Plan for BEKEMV™ (eculizumab) 
A summary of the RMP for BEKEMV is presented below. 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for BEKEMV.  The RMP details 
important risks of BEKEMV, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about BEKEMV's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
BEKEMV's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how BEKEMV should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for BEKEMV should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
BEKEMV's RMP. 
I.  The Medicine and What it is Used For 
BEKEMV is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH) (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains eculizumab as the 
active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of BEKEMV’s benefits can be found in 
BEKEMV’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/bekemv. 
II.  Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of BEKEMV, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about BEKEMV's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of BEKEMV, these measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of BEKEMV are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of BEKEMV.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Important potential risk:  Serious metabolic harms due to sorbitol exposure in patients with 
hereditary fructose intolerance 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
This is considered an important potential risk based on the known 
effects of administering other parenteral sorbitol/fructose-containing 
medicines to patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.  Babies and 
children below 2 years of age represent a population with high risk, as 
hereditary fructose intolerance may not yet have been diagnosed 
(European Medicines Agency:  Information for the package leaflet 
regarding fructose and sorbitol used as excipients in medicinal products 
for human use; EMA/CHMP/460886/2014).  BEKEMV is contraindicated 
in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (regardless of their age), 
and in babies and children below 2 years of age. 
Patients diagnosed with hereditary fructose intolerance (regardless of 
their age), and babies and children below 2 years of age with potentially 
undiagnosed hereditary fructose intolerance.  The worldwide incidence 
of hereditary fructose intolerance at birth is estimated at 1:20 000 to 
1:30 000.  The disorder is not apparent until the infant is weaned and fed 
with formula, juice, fruits, baby foods, or honey that contain fructose.  In 
young children, a spontaneous aversion for fructose develops and the 
onset of symptoms may be delayed when parents scrupulously respect 
the child’s tastes for food and do not impose fructose-containing 
products rejected by the child (European Medicines Agency:  
Information for the package leaflet regarding fructose and sorbitol used 
as excipients in medicinal products for human use; 
EMA/CHMP/460886/2014).  Chronically untreated exposure to sorbitol 
in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance may result in failure to 
thrive and renal and hepatic failure.

Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that  exhibits many of the same glucose -lowering actions as GLP-1, 
a naturally occurring incretin hormone. Exenatide twice daily (Byetta ) is administered by subcutaneous 
injection. It was approved in the EU on 20  November 2006 for use in  adult patients with  T2DM. 
BYDUREON, exenatide 2 mg once weekly prolonged-release aqueous formulation (hereafter referred to as 
EQW) was first approved for marketing in the EU on 17  June 2011. BYDUREON BCise, exenatide once 
weekly prolonged-release non-aqueous suspension via autoinjector (referred to as EQWS), was approved 
in the EU  on 27 August 2018.   
In the EU, BYDUREON aqueous and non-aqueous formulations are approved for use in adults 18 years 
and older with  T2DM to improve glycaemic control in combination with  other glucose -lowering medicinal 
products including basal insulin, when the  therapy in use, together with  diet and exercise, does not 
provide adequate glycaemic control.   
The purpose of this variation is to provide information to support the efficacy, safety, and PK of 
BYDUREON (EQW) and BYDUREON BCise (EQWS) in the treatment of adolescents with  T2DM. This 
submission consists of the  following study: 
Assessment report

Page 7/71 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Study BCB114 - D5551C00002 (hereafter referred to as study BCB114): “A Phase 3, Double -
blind, Placebo-controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of 
Exenatide Once Weekly in Adolescents with  Type 2 Diabetes” 
This study is part of a paediatric program based on an agreed Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP), (PIP 
number: EMEA-000689-PIP01-09-M10)  (EMA  Decision: P/0064/2021). 
Study BCB114 has previously been assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/002020/P46/028.  
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The proposed extension of the indication in  T2DM is: 
“Bydureon is indicated in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and  above with  type 2 
diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with  othe r glucose lowering medicinal 
products including basal insulin, when the  therapy in use, together with  diet and exercise, does not 
provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
Epidemiology 
The prevalence of T2DM has increased in children and adolescents and has bee n reported to account for 
between 8% and 45% of all new cases of diabetes reported in  children and adolescents (Temneanu et al 
2016).  Evidence has shown that a diagnosis of T2DM  in childhood, coupled with  inadequate glycaemic 
control, increases the risk of early mortality as well as early end organ damage (Cavallo 2006).  
Clinical presentation and prognosis 
T2DM is usually diagnosed in the adolescent period with  an average age of onset of 13 years (Pulgaron 
and Delamater 2014). Evidence has shown that  a dia gnosis of T2DM in childhood coupled with  inadequate 
glycaemic control increases the risk of early end organ damage and mortality (Cavallo 2006 ,  Candler et al 
2018). 
Management 
While multiple medications are available for the treatment of T2DM in the  adult  population, only insulin, 
metformin, and, more recently liraglutide QD (a GLP-1 RA administered by injections, approved in 2019 
in the US and EU)  are approved for use in the paediatric population  with T2DM.  As there are limited 
licensed options  for the treatment  of T2DM in  patients 10 to 17  years of age, there is an unmet medical 
need for additional safe and effective therapies for this  age group.   
To address this unmet medical need, the  efficacy, safety, and PK of BYDUREON, a once -weekly 
treatment, has been evaluated in the paediatric population with  T2DM in the exenatide clinical 
development program.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that  exhibits many of the same glucose -lowering actions as GLP-1, 
a naturally occurring incretin hormone.  
Exenatide prolonged release was first approved for use in the  EU on 17 June 2011.  It is currently 
available as either as a vial and prefilled syringe single dose tray (SDT) or in a prefilled dual chamber pen 
(DCP), administered by subcutaneous injection.  In order to  avoid the need for recombination prior to 
administration, exenatide prolonged-release non-aqueous suspension via autoinjector was developed 
(Bydureon BCise; hereafter referred to as EQW).  It was approved in the  EU on 27 August 2018.   
In the EU, Bydureon is approved for use in adults  18 years and older with  T2DM to improve glycaemic 
control in combination with  other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin,  when the 
therapy in  use, together with  diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The exenatide Phase IIb/III/IIIb clinical development program established the efficacy and safety of 
exenatide in lowering glucose levels in adults. 
The MAH states that  study BCB114 was developed in accordance with  the US FDA Guidance for Industry: 
Diabetes Mellitus  — Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for Treatment and Prevention (FDA 
February 2008)  and is consistent with  the CHMP Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal  Products 
in the Treatment or Prevention of Diabetes Mellitus  (CPMP/EWP/1080/00,  Rev 1, 2012).  
The MAH did not  seek Scientific advice at  the CHMP. 
With  the finalisation of study BCB114, the MAH has completed the PIP for exenatide which included in 
total 5  studies.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH has stated that  the study was performed in accordance with the ethical principles that  ha ve 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and that  are consistent with  International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), applicable regulatory requirements and the MAH’s 
policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Samples. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Exenatide is a chemically synthesized 39-amino acid single-chain peptide and, as such, is considered a 
naturally-occurring product, which  is not expected to remain either stable or  biologically active in the 
environment for any significant  period of time . 
Exenatide is considered to  be a non-hazardous, biodegradable product. The environmental risk in terms 
of use and disposal is considered to be negligible and in accordance with  the guideline (CHMP 2006)  ERA 
studies are not  submitted, which  is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 9/71 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which is considered acceptable. The 
applicant has previously performed non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies according to the paediatric 
investigation plan. These studies were assessed in previous procedures and have not  been re-assessed 
for the current application. 
The applicant has not  submitted an ERA. Given that  exenatide is a peptide, this is acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which is considered acceptable. 
Considering the  above data, exenatide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The current application is supported by Study BCB114; a multi-centre,  randomized, parallel-group, Phase 
III study in adolescent patients (10 to  17 years of age) with  T2DM. The PK data from study BCB114, in 
combination with  PK data from other clinical studies  was analysed using population  PK (popPK) approach. 
Full  details of the  clinical pharmacology properties of exenatide have been previously summarized.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the  effect that  clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with  the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical Methods 
A new bioanalysis method was used for study D5551C00002  (BCB114), TNJS15 -094.  In the  bioanalysis of 
exenatide at Covance (8328-394,  VR 8360-719),  QCs and standards performing within  pre -set 
acceptance criteria and satisfactory ISR results (98.3%).  All samples were analysed within  the above 
established storage stability duration, as well as established benchtop and freezer thaw stability.  
The ligand binding assay for antibodies against exenatide (anti-drug  antibodies, ADA) was the same as in 
the initial  application. No data is available on the neutralising potential of the ADAs.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis  
In study BCB114 individual samples for analysis of plasma exenatide concentrations were c ollected from 
patients pre-dose at Weeks 0,  4, 8, 12, 24,  52, and 62 (Figure 1).  No intra-dose PK profiles were 
recorded.

Patients who received placebo during the double-blind controlled assessment period, and went on to enter the open-label extension period and receive 
open-label EQW, had plasma exenatide concentrations measured at Week 52 only.  
The GSD interval was calculated by multiplication/division of the geometric mean. 
Concentration values < LLOQ occurring after the first dose, but prior to the first quantifiable value, were imputed to LLOQ/2 . Concentration values < LLOQ 
occurring after the first dose, and after the first quantifiable value, were excluded from the analyses.

The objective with  the popPK analysis was to assess the pha rmacokinetics (PK) of exenatide plasma 
concentrations in adolescents with  T2DM from study D5551C00002 at  steady state and compare the 
plasma concentrations to adults  with T2DM  (Phase 3 studies). Exenatide from once -weekly dosing 
accumulates in  the systemic circulation over only a slightly  shorter time scale (8 to 10 weeks). 
Data  and  Methods 
The present analysis is based on exenatide plasma concentrations from a study in T2DM patients  aged 10 
to 17 years (D5551C00002).  Overall, 59  patients were randomised to   receive EQW. Predose exenatide 
concentrations were collected at week 4, 8, 12,  24, and 52 (end of treatment). Estimated  glomerular 
filtration  rate (eGFR) was derived using the Bedside Schwartz equation (Schwartz et al 2009).   
The popPK model was based on steady state data. Therefore, non-steady state concentrations (prior to 
week 8 and after week 30 for PK) were excluded from the  dataset. Further, samples with  high antibody 
titre (>  625) were excluded due to  interference in the analytical methods for exena tide. Exenatide 
concentrations below the lower limit  of quantification (LLOQ)  were also excluded. Missing covariate values 
were imputed  within  a subject, using the  last observation carried forward method with  the following 
exception: missing screening/baseline values of covariates were imputed backward (using  the first, post-
baseline record of the covariate for that subject). If all values for a subject were missing, the  mean, 
median, or mode value (as appropriate for that  covariate) for the treatment (or o ther relevant factor) 
group was used as the imputed value. 
The popPK model utilised in this  analysis was developed based on 5 Phase 3 studies using only the 15 kg 
manufacturing scale exenatide microspheres (earlier studies utilized non -commercial scale manufacturing 
batches). The popPK model describing Css,avg is shown below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 12/71 
 
 
 
 
 
Where  Css,avg,ij  is the individually predicted predose steady-state  concentration (pg/mL) for 
the ith  subject at the jth measurement, baseline eGFRi is the  baseline eGFR for the ith  subject, IBW is the 
ideal body weight  for the ith  subject, T125,625,ij  is an indicator variable for antibodies to exenatide for 
the ith  subject at the jth measurement (T125,625ij  =  1 if antibody titre  to exenatide ≥ 125,  0  otherwise), 
ηi is the inter-individual variability (IIV) estimate for the ith subject. The IIV was modelled using a normal 
distribution  with  mean of 0 and variance of ω2.  The Frel is the relative bioavailability for the  suspension 
formulation of EQWS relative to EQW. Parameter estimates from the final model is presented in Table 2.

Results 
The PopPK and ER models were based on samples from >1000  adults with  T2DM. Addition of relatively 
few data points from study BCB114 was therefore not anticipated  to have a major impact on  the 
parameter estimates if re-estimated. Therefore, external model evaluations were performed. A summary 
of Data Used (34%  of all available samples) in the  popPK Analysis of Exenatide in  Adolescents with T2DM 
is presented in

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that  exhibits many of the same glucose -lowering actions as GLP-1, 
a naturally occurring incretin hormone.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The ER model utilised in  this analysis was developed based on all adult phase 2 and phase 3 study data 
from studies  using EQW and EQWS. The objective with  ER analysis was to assess the relationship 
between predicted average plasma exenatide concentrations at steady state (Css,avg) and glycosylated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c)  at steady state and compare HbA1c in adolescents with T2DM  from study BCB114 
to adults with  T2DM (Phase 3 studies). The PD endpoint,  HbA1c, reflects the average blood glucose level 
over the preceding 90  to 120 days. HbA1c samples were collected at day 1 and week 4, 8, 12, 18,  24, 28, 
40, and 52. 
The previously developed ER model for EQW and EQWS was estimated based on HbA1c data using an 
Emax model. Estimates from the ER model can be  found in Table 4.

Table 5  provides a summary of the new data available for ER analysis. Figure 5 shows the observed 
HbA1c versus time after first dose at steady state for both  adults and children. The adolescents had lower 
age and higher eGFR than adult T2DM  patients. Further,  they had si milar proportion of concomitant 
metformin, but somewhat smaller proportion with  concomitant medication of sulphonamides and 
thiazolidinediones, and lower fasting plasma glucose. However, body weight,  body mass index and HbA1c 
levels were similar in both  groups. Fewer of the adolescents were Caucasian (41% versus 78.7%), 
whereas more were black (20.5%  versus 11.2%) or other ethnicity (25.6%  versus 0.8%).  The proportion 
of males/females and different levels of antibody titre  were comparable between the 2 popu lations. 
The ER model was based on steady state  data. Therefore, non-steady state concentrations (prior to week 
12 and after week 30 for HbA1c) were excluded from the dataset. Missing  covariate values were imputed 
within  a subject, using the last observation carried forward method with  the following  exception: missing 
screening/baseline values of covariates were imputed backward (using the first,  post-baseline record of 
the covariate for that subject). If all values for a subject were missing, the  mean, med ian, or mode value 
(as appropriate for that  covariate) for the treatment (or other relevant factor) group was used as the 
imputed value.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has conducted a randomized, placebo -controlled study (BCB114) including 59  children, where 
individual samples of plasma exenatide and HbA1c were collected from paediatric patients.  No intra -dose 
PK profiles were recorded. 
Bioanalysis of exenatide and anti-exenatide antibodies was conducted. The cross-validation report 8360-
719 confirmed the adequacy of the  method.  
The validation of the ADA method is outdated  and incomplete. In particular, data is missing on sensitivity 
and drug tolerance of the assay. However, updating  the assay to meet current requirements would hinder 
comparability to earlier data in adults.  Thus, a new assay is not  requested, as comparability is considered 
more important  in this particular case.  
Data indicates a higher incidence of ADAs in children compared to adults, which  may have an impact both 
on the PK of exenatide and on the efficacy, in  case of high  ADA titer or if the ADAs are neutralizing. As 
noted at the time  of MAA, immunogenicity is primarily a concern for efficacy and not  safety for this

medicinal product. The impact of ADAs in children may be higher than in adults  and children may be 
exposed to a higher risk of lack of efficacy. See efficacy section for further discussion.  
Regarding the neutralising  potential of the ADAs, such data would be appreciated. HbA1c data may be 
indicative of neutralisation,  but due to different kinetics of ADA and HbA1c response, a direct conclusive 
link cannot be established. The applicant clarified that  they do not in tend  to develop an assay to 
characterize the neutralising potential  of anti-exenatide antibodies. It is still considered of importance to 
get a grasp of the neutralising potential  of the  ADAs as it  potentially affects the benefit/risk balance to a 
larger extent in this  population. The applicant proposed monitoring of Hb1Ac on the individual level, which 
may serve a similar purpose as a neutralising antibody assay in the clinical practice. The issue is thus not 
further pursued. 
Population PK analysis was used to  analyse the data from children in study BCB114. The population  PK 
model used was previously developed based on adult steady -state data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies 
that  included adults with  T2DM who received the commercial exenatide formul ation. Non-steady state 
concentrations (57%), samples with high  antibody titre (7% were > 625) and concentrations below the 
lower limit of quantification  (LLOQ, 2%) were excluded from the BCB114 dataset for this analysis. Only 
34% of the total  number of available PK samples were used in the analysis, and the exclusions resulted in 
11 subjects being completely excluded from the analysis. To discard so much of collected data, that 
contains considerable amounts of information that  would have been useful for bo th  the basic and in-dept 
understanding of the PK of exenatide in  children goes against good modelling practice and ethical 
principles. The MAH  could have e.g. described the relationship between PK and ADA/nAb better as a 
higher proportion of children have positive ADA response and higher ADA -titres which affects the PK. 
Currently the model only has a very rough estimate of the ADA impact with  a categorical covariate at the 
cut-off of ADA titre ≥125.  The data handling limits the  use of the model and the conc lusions that  can be 
made. However, given the  objective of the  population model and that  it is not  pivotal for this applicant, 
the issue is not pursued further. The adult  model population parameters were not  re -estimated. The 
paediatric data were used as an external validation. The parameter Theta 1,  named Css,avg, estimates 
the concentration measured pre-dose, which is not  ‘trough’ concentration as the  value is not the lowest 
value on the concentration-time  interval due to the release characteristics of the  product. The model can 
acceptably describe the observed trough concentration at steady state  of exenatide in  children that  
remained after data exclusion. The model can adequately predict the steady state trough exposure at 
steady state  in children with  lower ADA-titre, and the  concentrations are predicted to be similar to the 
exposure in adults. No trends are observed for the  relationship between the  predicted average exenatide 
at steady state versus different continuous  and categorical covariates.  
The applicant had a developed exposure-HbA1c model based on all adult phase 2 and phase 3 study 
data from studies using  EQW and EQWS. The objective of the steady -state exenatide-HbA1c model was to 
show that  the response at steady state of exenatide is similar in adults and adolescent. The PD endpoint, 
HbA1c, reflects the average blood glucose level over the  preceding 90 to 120  days. Overall, 45% of 
collected HbA1c samples that  were available after the  PK dataset exclusions were used in the  external 
validation of the ER model, and only 39 out of the 58  subjects included in the  BCB114 study were 
included in the ER analysis. It  is unclear which subjects are represented in the ER analysis, which  limits 
the conclusions that can be made, and the model is therefore less relevant in  this application. The model 
includes the impact of ADA-titre (categorical, if ≥125).  The applicant has not characterized the abundance 
of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) in adults (or children), therefore nAb are not included as a covariate. An 
adequate characterisation of ADA and nAb is of importance if even younger individuals are going to be 
included in the indication.  A higher proportion of children in  BCB114 developed ADA and had higher ADA -
titres compared to adults.  As ADA affects the effect, a higher proportion of children may have a lower 
effect than adults, even despite achieving similar plasma concentrations. The relationship between effect 
and ADA titre may not be properly described in the current model as the abundance ADA is lower in 
Assessment report

Page 19/71 
 
 
 
 
adults. The relationship may be underestimated. Furthermore, the  inclusion of the  ADA -titre effect is very 
crude in  the model (categorical, if ≥125). Additional  cut-offs in the model would have provided additional 
information on the impact of ADA-titre, as higher proportion of children have higher titres. Despite the 
fact that  the model can acceptably describe the steady state HbA1c -data in the children that  were 
included in the analysis and that  have a lower ADA -titre, no firm conclusions regarding HbA1c ca n be 
drawn from this  analysis, due to the shortcomings described above. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant used population  PK and PKPD analysis to describe the  observed concentration of exenatide 
and HbA1c from study BCB114, however, data handling limits  the relevance of the model results. The PK 
model could describe the  trough concentrations at steady state  for the children included in the analysis 
with  lower ADA-titres.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
In support of the proposed extension of the indication  to include adolescents and children >10  years of 
age, one clinical study has been submitted. 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study BCB114: “A phase 3, double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, multicenter study to assess 
the safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly in  adolescents with  type 2 diabetes” 
Methods 
Overall  Study Design 
Study BCB114 was Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, international  study that 
included male and female patients  10 to 17 years of age with  T2DM treated with  diet and exercise alone 
or in combination with  a stable dose of oral antidiabe tic agents and/or insulin  for at least 2 months  prior 
to screening.  
The study was designed to recruit a paediatric population representative of that  to be treated with  EQW 
and EQWS in clinical practice. Study BCB114 included patients with  an HbA1c of 6.5%  to 11.0%, 
inclusive, in patients not taking insulin/SU,  and with  an HbA1c of 6.5%  to 12.0%,  inclusive, in  patients 
taking insulin/SU,  at Screening, and patients with  a C -peptide of > 0.6  ng/mL at Screening. 
At least 40% and not more than 60% of the randomized patients  were to be female patients.  At least 
40% of patients were to be recruited from areas with similar ethnicity and lifestyle to those of the EU 
member states. 
The study duration was 62 weeks (excluding the extended safety follow -up period; see below) and 
comprised 4 periods (Figure  9): 
•  Screening period (5  weeks)  
•  Controlled assessment period (24  weeks): double -blind, placebo-controlled period to examine the 
efficacy and safety of EQW compared with placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 20/71 
 
 
 
 
• 
Extension period (28  weeks): open-label, uncontrolled period to examine the long-term safety 
and efficacy of EQW 
• 
Post-treatment follow-up period (10 weeks) 
For the controlled assessment period, patients were r andomly assigned in a 5:2 ratio to receive either 
EQW 2 mg (Group A) or placebo (Group B). During the  extension period (Week  25 through Week 52), 
patients assigned to the EQW 2 mg treatment (Group A) continued to be treated with EQW  2 mg, and 
patients randomized to  placebo (Group B) received EQW 2 mg. In addition to receiving study 
medications, all patients were to  participate in  a lifestyle intervention program encompassing diet and 
physical activity modifications. 
In addition, an exploratory mixed meal substudy was performed to evaluate the effect of EQW on 
postprandial beta-cell function  after approximately 28 weeks of EQW treatment  and at  approximately 10 
to 12 weeks following cessation of study medication. 
Figure 9: Flow  Chart of Study Design 
All visits scheduled  during the controlled assessment  period and during the open-label extension period were to occur 
within ±2 days of the scheduled date, relative to Visit 2 (Week 0). 
Visit 11 was to take place at least 10  weeks and  no later than 12 weeks after the last dose of EQW. 
The investigator and/or qualified study-site personnel  was to contact  patients by phone  at Week 2, Week 16, and 
Week 26 to discuss  study compliance, address  any questions related to study medication, and  revi ew adverse events. 
EQW, exenatide 2 mg once weekly; P, phone  call.  
Study participants 
The patient population included male and females 10 to < 18  years of age, diagnosed with  T2DM, and 
treated with  diet and exercise alone or in combination with  a stable  dose of an oral antidiabetic agent 
(metformin and/or SU) and/or insulin for at least 2 months prior to screening.  
The study included patients with  an HbA1c of 6.5% to 11.0%,  inclusive, in patients not taking insulin/SU, 
and of 6.5% to 12.0%,  inclusive, in patients taking insulin/SU,  at screening, and patients with  a C -
peptide of > 0.6 ng/mL  at screening. 
At least 40% and not more than 60% of the randomized patients  were to be female patients.  At least 
40% of patients were to be recruited from areas with similar ethnicity and lifestyle to those of the EU 
member states.

Treatments 
Caregivers were to administer study medication (2  mg EQW  or matching placebo) subcutaneously to the 
patient (or the patient  self-administered, if deemed appropriate) once weekly (± 2 days) relative to the 
date of the first dose of study medication (Visit 2 [Week 0]),  for the  duration of the  study, as applicable. 
Adjustments to dosing regimens were not permitted. 
The 2 mg weekly dose of BYDUREON used in Study BCB114 was s elected based on information from 
studies with  exenatide conducted in adolescents (see Study 2993-124)  and with  EQW conducted in adults 
(see Malloy et al 2009).  Study BCB114 included patients  treated with  diet and exercise alone or in 
combination with  a stable dose of oral antidiabetic agent (metformin and/or SU) and/or insulin;  thus, 
placebo was an appropriate choice of comparator for Study BCB114.  
Rescue Treatment 
Patients with  a loss of glycaemic control, defined as either an increase from baseline in Hb A1c  values by 
≥ 1.0%  at 2 consecutive clinic visits that  were at least 1 month  apart, or a fasting plasma glucose value 
≥ 250  mg/dL or random blood glucose value > 300  mg/dL for 4 days during a 7 -day period, were to 
receive rescue treatment. Patients who required rescue therapy were to receive antihyperglycemic 
therapy (e.g., insulin)  by the Investigator. Patients receiving rescue therapy were to remain in the study 
and continue receiving study medication, at the discretion of the Investigator. The temporar y use of 
insulin to  treat acute decompensation due to an intercurrent illness was permitted for up to 2 weeks. 
Extended use of insulin  in this manner was to  be considered as rescue treatment.  
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of the  study was to  assess the effect on glycaemic control, as measured by 
HbA1c, of EQW following 24 weeks of treatment  compared with placebo in  children and adolescents with 
T2DM. 
The primary safety objective was to evaluate the  safety and tolerability of EQW compared with  pl acebo 
following 24 weeks of treatment  in children and adolescents with  T2DM. 
Outcomes/endpoints

• 
Proportions of patients discontinuing  the study and the proportion of patients needing rescue due 
to failure to maintain glycaemic control, and number of rescue episodes at Visit  7 (Week 24), Visit 
10 (Week 52), and at each intermediate visit as applicable  
Sample size 
The study population consisted of male or female children and adolescents of 10 to  < 18 years of age, 
diagnosed with  T2DM, and treated with  diet and exercise alone or in combination with  a stable dose of an 
oral antidiabetic  agent (metformin and/or sulfonylurea [SU]) and/or insulin for at least 2 months prior to 
screening). 
Target Sample Size 
Approximately 77 patients were to be randomized into this study  to yield 70 evaluable patients.  This was 
estimated to provide an overall power of 74% to  reject the null  hypothesis of no difference between the 2 
treatment arms assuming a true treatment difference of -0.7% between exenatide and placebo in 
changes from baseline for glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%),  with  a common standard deviation of 
1.0% and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
At least 40% and not more than 60% of the randomized patients  were to be females. At least 40% of 
patients were to be recruited from areas with similar ethnicity and lifestyle to those of the  European 
Union member states. 
Randomisation 
Patients who met all study requirements based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
randomized via an interactive voice response system/interactive web response system; patients  were 
assigned to  1 of 2  treatment groups in  5:2 ratio (Group A: Group  B, see Figure  9) at Visit 2 (Week 0). 
Randomization was stratified  by screening HbA1c (<  9.0% or ≥ 9.0%)  and country.   
Blinding 
The MAH, the  study-site personnel, and patients were blinded to treatment allocation during the double -
blind controlled assessment period. Every effort was made to ensure that patients  remained blinded to 
treatment during this  period. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The Randomized Analysis Set consisted of all randomized patients.   
The ITT Analysis Set consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1   dose of randomized 
study medication.  
The Evaluable Analysis Set consisted of all randomized patients  who received at least 1  dose of 
randomized study medication and had at least 1 baseline and postbaseline HbA1c assessment. Evaluable 
patients were to be analysed in accordance with their planned treatment group.  
The Safety Analysis Set consisted of all patients who  received at least 1  dose of study medication. If a 
patient randomized to the placebo group received at least 1 dose of EQW during the controlled 
assessment period, their actual group was to be derived as EQW.

Prespecified analyses of the primary efficacy variable were conducted using the Evaluable Analysis Set 
and analyses of the  secondary efficacy variables were to be performed for the ITT Analysis Set, unless 
otherwise specified. The Evaluable Analysis Set and ITT Analysis Set were identical  for this  study.  
Analysis Methods   
In general, prespecified primary and secondary continuous efficacy variables for which multiple 
postbaseline measurements were collected were to be analysed using  an MMRM  approach. The statistical 
analysis of categorical variables was to  be conducted using a stratified  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. 
Where applicable, the Early Termination visit were to be included in  the analyses.  
Primary Analysis 
The prespecified primary efficacy analysis compared treatment groups (EQW versus placebo) with respect 
to change in HbA1c from baseline (Visit 2 [Week 0])  to Visit 7 (Week 24)  using the MMRM  approach. The 
model included change in HbA1c as the dependent variable and treatment  group, visit, interaction 
between visit and treatment, region, baseline HbA1c and interaction between visit and baseline HbA1c as  
the fixed effects. The least squares (LS) mean, 2-sided 95%  confidence interval, and p-value of the 
difference in the change of HbA1c  between the  EQW and PBO groups at  Visit 7 (Week 24) were provided, 
as well as the LS mean for each treatment group at Week 24, the  SE, and the corresponding 95%  CI. The 
mean (SD) observed HbA1c at baseline and Week 24 was also presented by treatment  group.  
Intercurrent events that  may have occurred during the study were defined as receipt of rescue therapy, 
study medication discontinuation,  and study withdrawal.  Data collected after the initiation  of the rescue 
medication or following  discontinuation of study medication were to be excluded from the analysis, except 
for select sensitivity analyses and plasma EQW concentration  endpoints, where data after rescue were 
included.

Withdrawal from study prior to  Week 24: Hypothetical approach using MI 
pattern mixture model imputation. 
Descriptive subgroup analysis was performed for the primary variable. 
Sensitivity Analyses  of the Primary Endpoint 
Several sensitivity analyses were prespecified including  an imputation  sensitivity analysis using the 
treatment policy estimand that tested the  assumption of MAR made by the MMRM  analysis (see table 
above). For this  purpose, a multiple imputation  (MI) pattern mixture model that assumed MNAR was 
implemented whereby assumptions for the missing data were to “stress test”  the MAR assumptions of the 
primary analysis (see Molenberghs and Kenward 2007a,  Molenberghs and Kenward 2007b). The proposed 
MNAR sensitivity analysis assumes that the trajectory after the intercurrent event from the  EQW group, 
regardless of the type of event, can be modelled by that  of PBO patients. This assu mption tends to result 
in smaller estimates of difference between the treatment groups, compared to those under the  MAR 
assumption. The patterns here are defined by the  time of the intercurrent event, with  the imputed  values 
for both treatment groups modelled by observed outcomes from the placebo group only . Note that  in this 
analysis, PBO missing/excluded observations are imputed assuming MAR and here follows the pattern of 
observed PBO observations, while missing/excluded observations for the EQW group ar e assumed MNAR. 
This strategy for imputation  is commonly referred to as the copy-reference approach. 
Analysis of secondary variables 
Similar to  the primary analysis, data including the  Early Termination visit where applicable  were included 
in the MMRM  and CMH  analysis for secondary analysis variables. For patients  who initiated  rescue 
medication and continued study participation, data collected after the initiation  of rescue medication were 
excluded from analyses. Data collected after discontinuation  of IP were excluded from analyses for all 
secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Handling of missing data 
Missing data in  this study may result from patients discontinuing  from the  study prematurely  
or missing intermediate visits or selected assessments while remaining on study.  Data collected after the 
first administration of rescue therapy were excluded fr om the  descriptive statistical summary and 
inferential statistical analyses for all efficacy endpoints, except the plasma exenatide concentration 
endpoint. For efficacy analyses, in general, missing observations were not imputed, except those inherited 
from the  mixed model repeated measures (MMRM)  which implicitly assumes that  data are missing at 
random (MAR).  However, data collected after initiation  of rescue medication were included in several 
sensitivity and supportive analyses for the primary analysis to provide a comprehensive view of the 
treatment effect. 
The pre- and post-withdrawal  values were to  be assessed to understand the impact of dropouts on   
the efficacy results. The primary efficacy endpoint of HbA1c  data were visually examined to explore the  
missingness patterns  by: 
(1) plotting  each individual patient’s HbA1c change trajectory in completers side -by-side with  those who 
have prematurely discontinued study medication, and by  
(2) plotting  the last  HbA1c change from baseline for those who  discon tinue study medication prematurely, 
overlaid with  the box plot  of change from baseline in HbA1c by visit for completers.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 25/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For categorical endpoints HbA1c goals of <6.5%, ≤6.5%  and < 7% at 24  weeks, any patient  with  missing 
HbA1c value at  24 weeks was considered as non-responder. The same applied for these variables at 52 
weeks endpoint. Demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as safety data were analysed based on 
the observed data only. Data beyond discontinuation  of study medication were not in cluded in the 
analyses. 
Hierarchical Testing Strategy 
A fixed-sequence procedure hierarchical testing strategy was followed to protect the family -wise error 
rate for the primary endpoint  and secondary endpoints: if superiority for the primary endpoint  was 
established at the 2-sided significance level α =  0.05, the same superiority test was to be performed for 
selected secondary endpoints in the following,  prespecified order:  
1.  Change in HbA1c from baseline Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit  7 (Week 24) 
2.  Change in FPG concentration from baseline Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 7 (Week 24) 
3.  Change in body weight  from baseline Visit  2 (Week 0) to Visit 7  (Week 24) 
4.  Change in fasting insulin from baseline Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 7 (Week 24) 
If the null hypothesis was not rejected for any of the first 4 tests in  the hierarchy, a nomi nal p-value was 
presented for the remaining endpoints but was to be considered exploratory.  
For all other secondary and exploratory endpoints, p-values were to be presented but these were to  be 
considered exploratory in nature with  no multiplicity  adjustme nt applied. A nominal level of α =  0.05 was 
to be reported. 
Database  lock and  changes in the  analyses  
The initial database lock for Study BCB114 occurred on 11 June 2020;  however, during the subsequent 
quality check of ADA data for patients  randomized to the EQW group, some errors were noted. The final 
database lock with the  corrected data occurred on 06  August 2020, and the correct ADA data for patients 
randomized to the  EQW group are provided in the BCB114 CSR.  
Additionally, it was noted that  results for PK and ADA samples collected for patients randomized to  the 
placebo group had not been included in the data transfer. The PK and ADA results for patients 
randomized to placebo have not been included in this submission and will be summarized in an addendum  
to the BCB114 CSR. 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) epidemic is not judged to meaningfully impact the  overall 
quality of the study, including  the conduct, data, and interpretation of results.  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was finalised on 21 May 2020 and included several minor changes 
from the  protocol specified analysis.

The disposition of the patients in this  study is summarized in Figure 10. A total  of 83  patients were 
randomized (EQW, 59;  placebo, 24) and 82  received study treatment during the  24-week controlled 
assessment period (EQW,  58; placebo, 24).  A total  of 73 patients (88.0%)  (EQW, 50  [84.7%];  placebo, 
23 [95.8%])  completed the 24-week controlled assessment period, and 72 patients (86.7%)  (EQW, 49 
[83.1%];  placebo, 23 [95.8%])  completed treatment during the  controlled assessment period. 
Discontinuation of study treatment was primarily due to withdrawal  by patient  (EQW, 6/8  patients; 
placebo, 0/1  patients); no patients  discontinued due to  AEs.  
All patients received EQW during the uncontrolled extension period from Week  24  to Week 52. A total  of 
72 patients  (86.7%) received EQW during the uncontrolled extension period (EQW, 49;  placebo, 23). A 
total of 64 patients  (77.1%)  (EQW, 46; placebo, 18) completed the  uncontrolled extension period, and 62 
patients (74.7%)  (EQW, 44;  placebo, 18) completed EQW treatment during the  uncontrolled extension 
period. Discontinuation  of study treatment during the extension period was primarily due to withdrawal 
by patient (EQW, 4/5  patients; placebo, 3/5  patients); no patients  discontinued due to AEs.  
Recruitment 
A total of 159 patients  enrolled in this  study from 36 centers; 27 study centers randomized patients 
during the study.  
First  subject enrolled: 12 May 2016 
Last subject last visit: 06  May 2020

Protocol Deviations 
The number of patients with  important  protocol deviations in each treatment  group are summarized in 
Table 6.  Important protocol deviations were defined as those that  may greatly impact the completeness, 
accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a patient’s rights,  safety, or 
well-being. 
The proportion of patients  with at least one important protocol deviation was generally balanced between 
the EQW group and the placebo group (59.3%  and 50.0%, respectively). The important protocol 
deviations recorded during the study  were similar between the treatment  groups, w ith  the exception of 
deviations due to patients  who did not adhere to  the protocol-specified visit schedule, which  were 
reported for a greater proportion of patients in  the EQW group than the placebo group (22.0%  and 8.3%, 
respectively).

Baseline weight, height, and BMI are displayed. BMI = weight (in kilograms)/(height [in meters2]). 
Baseline was defined as the last nonmissing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to first dose of 
randomized study medication. 
Percentiles were determined based on the standardized growth chart for boys and girls developed by the National Center 
for Health Statistics in collaboration with the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 
(see CDC 2000). 
Percentages were calculated from the number of patients in the analysis set with nonmissing data, by treatment group 
and total. 
BMI, body mass index; EQW, exenatide 2 mg once weekly; Max, maximum; Min, minimum; N, number of patients in 
treatment group; n, number of patients included in analysis; SD, standard deviation. 
A lower proportion of patients in the EQW group were in the ≥ 85 to  < 97 percentile for weight compared 
with  the placebo group (19.0%  and 41.7%,  respectively), while a greater proportion of patients  in the 
EQW were in  the ≥ 97 percentile for weight  compared with the  placebo group (72.4% and 54.2%, 
respectively). 
The mean height  of patients  at baseline was 165.6  cm (EQW,  165.7 cm; placebo, 165.3  cm) and the 
mean weight  was 100.6 kg (EQW, 102.2  kg; placebo, 96.7 kg). The mean BMI was 36.4  kg/m 2 (EQW, 
36.9  kg/m2; placebo, 35.1  kg/m2), and, as expected for this study population, the  majority of patients 
(75.6%)  were in the  ≥ 97 percentile for BMI (EQW, 77.6%;  placebo, 70.8%). 
Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the  EQW and placebo groups ( Table 9).

Duration of Diabetes (years) = (Date of screening – Date of diabetes diagnosis + 1) / 365.25. 
Prior antidiabetic medications were defined as antidiabetic medications that started prior to and continued past the first 
dose of randomized study medication. Antidiabetic medication was identified based on medical review of concomitant 
medications recorded during the study using the WHO-Drug Enhanced plus Herbal 01 Mar 2020 version.

In general, medical and surgical history were generally balanced between  the treatment groups, with  the 
exception of obesity which was reported in a greater proportion of patients  in the EQW group (32.2%) 
compared with  the placebo group (13.0%).  Overall, the most common medical history terms were obesity 
(26.8%),  hypertension (14.6%),  and asthma (13.4%).  The most common surgical history terms were 
appendicectomy (4.9%),  tonsillectomy (4.9%), esophagogastroduodenoscopy (2.4%), and 
adenotonsillectomy (2.4%).  All other surgical history terms were reported in one  patient  only. 
Pre-treatment medication use was low (20.7%  of patients  overall) and broadly similar between the EQW 
and placebo groups. Prior concomitant medication use was broadly similar between the treatment groups 
and across the treatment periods. Prior concomitant medic ations were reported in the  majority of patients

who entered the controlled assessment period (95.1%),  while prior concomitant  medications were 
reported in fewer patients who entered the open-label extension period (37.5%).   
For patients entering the  controlled assessment period, the most frequently used prior concomitant 
medications were biguanides (79.3%),  long-acting insulins and analogues for injection (37.8%),  and fast 
acting insulins  and analogues for injection (28.0%).  For patients entering the  open -label extension 
period, the  most common prior concomitant medications were fast acting insulins and analogues for 
injection (9.7%),  long-acting insulins  and analogues for injection (8.3%),  and biguanides (6.9%). 
Post-treatment medication use was reported in a low proportion of patients overall (25.6%)  and was 
broadly similar between the EQW and placebo → EQW groups. 
Overall, rescue medication use was generally low during the study.  One patient  in the EQW group (1.7%) 
reported using both  insulin aspart and insulin degludec in  the controlled assessment period.  
During the open-label extension period, 7 patients  (9.7%),  including 5 (10.2%)  in the EQW group and 2 
(8.7%)  in the placebo → EQW  group, reported use of rescue medication. The 4 reported rescue 
medications by generic term were insulin glargine, reported in 6.9%  of patients  (6.1% and 8.7%  in the 
EQW and placebo groups, respectively), insulin lispro, reported in 2.8%  of patients  (2.0% and 4.3% in 
the EQW and placebo groups, respectively), and insulin aspart and metformin, both  reported in 1.4% of 
patients (2.0%  and 0, in the EQW and placebo groups, respectively). 
Study Treatment  Compliance 
Compliance was generally high and similar between treatment  groups in both  the 24 -week controlled 
assessment period and 52-week treatment period (defined as the controlled assessment period and open -
label extension period combined). During the controlled assessment period, the  majority of patients 
(95.1%)  used 80%  to < 120%  of dispensed study medication: 57 patients (96.6%)  in the  EQW group 
and 21 patients (91.3%)  in the  placebo group. During the  treatment period (defined as the cont rolled 
assessment period and open-label extension period combined), the majority of patients  (95.8%)  used 
80% to  < 120% of dispensed study medication: 49 patients  (98.0%)  in the EQW group and 20 patients 
(90.9%)  in the placebo group. 
Numbers analysed 
The Randomized Analysis Set, which included all randomized patients,  consisted of 59 patients  in the 
EQW group and 24 patients in the  placebo group. One patient  who was randomized to EQW did not 
receive any study medication and was excluded from the ITT, Evalua ble, and Safety Analysis Sets. In 
addition, 1 patient  who was randomized to placebo received a dose of EQW in error and was subsequently 
reassigned to the EQW group for analyses based on actual treatment (i.e., for analyses based on the 
Safety and PK Analysis Sets). 
Of the patients who received at least 1 dose of randomized study medication, 55 patients  in the EQW 
group and 0 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 post-dose PK concentration assessment available 
and were included in the  PK Analysis Set. A further 6 patients in the EQW group and 3 patients in  the 
placebo group also provided informed consent/assent for the substudy, participated in  the standardized 
mixed meal test, completed study procedures in compliance with  the main CSP and the substud y, and 
had valid and adequate pharmacodynamic measurements, and were included in the  Standardized Mixed 
Meal Test Evaluable Analysis Set. Approximately 20 patients provided informed consent for the substudy; 
however, a high proportion of these patients  failed screening. Therefore, the actual number of patients 
that  participated in the mixed meal substudy was low.

Estimates from the MMRM  analysis of the change in HbA1c over time from baseline to Week  24 and are 
presented graphically in  Figure 11. For the EQW group, mean HbA1c decreased from baseline through 
Week 12 of the study, and then  began to gradually increase through Week  24 (but  remained below the 
baseline level). In the  placebo group, mean HbA1c remained stable from baseline through Week  12,  and 
then began to gradually increase through  Week  24. The difference between groups was maintained over 
24 weeks

Sensitivity analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed to support the primary analyses:  
The MMRM  analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was repeated including measurements after initiation 
of rescue therapy and discontinuation  of study medication. Results were consistent with  the primary 
analysis: the LS mean change in  HbA1c was -0.37%  for the EQW group and 0.49% for the placebo group. 
The difference in LS mean change between the  EQW and placebo groups was  -0.86%   
(p = 0.009).   
An imputation  sensitivity analysis to test the assumption of MAR that  was made by the MMRM  analysis 
was performed. A MI pattern  mixture model imputation  that assumed MNAR  was implemented whereby 
assumptions for the  missing data were to “stress test” the MAR assumptions of the primary analysis. 
Results were consistent with  the primary analysis: the LS mean change in HbA1c was  -0.34%  for the 
EQW group and 0.46% for the placebo group. The difference in LS mean change between the  EQW and 
placebo groups was -0.80% (p =  0.021).  
The MI pattern mixture model imputation  that  assumed MNAR was repeated including  measurements 
after initiation  of rescue therapy and discontinuation of study medication. Results were consistent with 
the primary analysis: the  LS mean change in HbA1c was -0.36% for the EQW group and 0.46% for the 
placebo group. The difference in LS mean change between the  EQW an d placebo groups was -0.81%   
(p = 0.014).

Secondary Endpoints: 
Change  in Fasting Plasma Glucose Concentration from Baseline  Visit 2 (Week  0) to Visit 7 
(Week  24), and to each  Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
EQW treatment resulted in a numerical decrease from baseline at  Week 24 in FPG (nominal p = 0.119) 
compared to an increase with  placebo; however, the difference between groups was not  statistically 
significant. Estimates  from the MMRM  analysis from baseline to  Week  24 are presented for the ITT 
Analysis Set in Table 12. 
The LS mean change in FPG was -5.2  mg/dL (-0.29  mmol/L) for the EQW group and 16.5 mg/dL (0.91 
mmol/L) for the placebo group. The difference in LS mean change between the  EQW and placebo groups 
was -21.6 mg/dL  (-1.20 mmol/L)  (p = 0.119).   
There was no statistically significant  difference in the FPG change from baseline to Week  24  between the 
EQW and placebo groups. Therefore, sequential testing  to contro l for multiplicity  stopped. All further 
analyses could not be considered statistically significant after controlling for multiplicity.

placebo group. For the EQW group, mean FPG decreased from baseline through Week  4 of the study, and 
then began to increase through Week  24.  In the placebo group, mean FPG fluctuated  from baseline 
through Week 12, and then began to increase through Week  24.  The observed separation between the 
EQW and placebo groups remained stable from Week  12 through  Week 24.

EQW treatment resulted in a numerical decrease from baseline at  Week 24 in body weight, compared to 
an increase with placebo. Estimates from the  MMRM  analysis from baseline to Week  24 are presented for 
the ITT Analysis Set in Table 13;  the change in body weight over time  is presented graphically in  Figure 
13. Change in body weight  from baseline was the third endpoint in  the testing hiera rchy (below FPG) and 
was therefore not formally tested for statistical significance. 
The LS mean change in body weight  was -0.59 kg for the  EQW group and 0.63  kg for the placebo group. 
The difference in LS mean change between the  EQW and placebo groups was  -1.22  kg (nominal

There were no meaningful differences between treatments in change from baseline at  Week  24 in fasting 
insulin.  Estimates from the MMRM  analysis from baseline to  Week 24 are presented for the ITT Analysis 
Set in Table 14(SI units).  Change in  fasting insulin from baseline was the fourth endpoint in  the testing 
hierarchy and was therefore not  formally tested for statistical significance.  
The LS mean change in fasting insulin was 79.6  pmol/L for the  EQW group and  -15.3  pmol/L for the

Proportion of patients  achieving HbA1c goals was not  included in the testing  hierarchy. Numerically 
greater proportions of patients  in the EQW group, compared with  placebo, achieved HbA1c goals of 
< 6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%, and < 7%  at Week 24.  
The proportion of patients  achieving HbA1c < 6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%, and < 7.0%  at Week 24 is summarized and

Change  in Lipids (Total Cholesterol, HDL-C,  LDL-C,  and Triglycerides) from Baseline  Visit 2 
(Week  0) to Visit 7 (Week  24), and to Each Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
There were no meaningful changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C, or HDL-C from baseline to Week 24 in the 
EQW group or in  the placebo group. For triglycerides, there was a numerically greater decrease in 
triglycerides from baseline to Week 24 in  the EQW group of -0.122  mmol/L compared with  the placebo 
group (0.094 mmol/L).  This corresponded to median percentage changes from baseline of  -13.1%  and 
5.7%,  respectively. 
Change  in Blood Pressure (Systolic and Diastolic) from Baseline  Visit  2 (Week  0) to Visit 7 
(Week  24), and to Each Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
Systolic Blood Pressure 
Treatment with  EQW was associated with a numerical decr ease from baseline to Week 24 in SBP 
compared with  a numerical increase in the placebo group. The LS mean change in SBP was  -0.7 mmHg 
for the EQW group and 2.2  mmHg for the placebo group. The difference in  LS mean change between the 
EQW and placebo groups was -2.8  mmHg. 
Diastolic Blood Pressure 
There were no meaningful differences between treatments for change from baseline at Week  24 for DBP. 
The LS mean change in DBP was 0.2 mmHg for the EQW group and -1.3 mmHg for the placebo group. 
The difference in LS mean change between the  EQW and placebo groups was 1.6 mmHg.   
Proportions of Patients Discontinuing the Study  and the Proportion of Patients  Needing  Rescue 
Due  to Failure  to Maintain  Glycaemic Control at Visit 7 (Week  24), and  at each  Intermediate 
Visit as Applicable 
The cumulative proportions of patients needing rescue medication due to  failure to maintain  glycaemic 
control at Week 24 were low (EQW: 1.7%,  placebo: 0%). One of the 58 patients  in the EQW group 
needed rescue medication at Week 18  due to  failure to maintain glycaemic control. None of the 24 
patients in  the placebo group needed rescue medication due to  failure to maintain  glycaemic control.  
Immunogenicity 
A summary of the  incidence of antibodies to exenatide by visit is presented in  Table 16.  
Antibodies to exenatide were observed in the majority of patients  (93.0%)  in the EQW group at any time 
during the study, with  more patients  having high positive results (63.2%)  compared with  low positive 
results (29.8%).  After an initial  increase in positive antibody levels, with  the percentage of patients 
positive for antibodies peaking at Week 12 (for high  positive antibody results [58.8%])  or Week  24 (for 
low positive antibody results [55.1%]),  antibody positivity decreased over the remaining time  period. At 
Week 52, the  percentage of patients  positive for antibodies was 31.1% (high  positive antibody results) or 
40.0%  (low positive antibody results). Approximately half of patients (approximately quarter in each 
category) were positive with  any positive result at the 10-week follow-up period.

At Week 24,  the mean change from baseline in HbA1c in the EQW group was greater in patients with  low 
positive antibodies (-0.73%)  compared with  those with  high positive antibodies (0.07%). In the total 
placebo group, HbA1c increased from baseline to Week 24, with  an LS mean change of 0.49. From 
Week 4 to Week 12, mean HbA1c  in the EQW group decreased over time for the low positive group and 
remained relatively stable for the  high positive group. Due to the low number of patients in the EQW 
group with  negative antibody results, no further comparisons could be made.

Figure 14: Change in HbA1c (%)  from Baseline and Antibody Titres to  EQW at each Visit between 
Baseline and Week 24, by treatment (Controlled Assessment Period) (Evaluable Analysis Set)  
For the primary outcome, there appears to be a trend showing reduced magnitude of mean changes from 
baseline in HbA1c  with higher anti-drug  antibody titre  categories. However, there is substantial variability 
of HbA1c response within  each titre  category which does not  allow for a reliable prediction of the HbA1c 
response for an individual patient.  In the first 12 weeks of Study BCB114, mean change in HbA1c 
decreases while mean anti-drug antibody titres increase, indicating  an accumulation of antibodies ( Figure 
14). Subsequently, mean HbA1c  increases over time and anti-drug  antibody titres  begin to decrease. The 
greatest difference in HbA1c response between EQW and placebo was established by Week 12 when 
antibody titres also reached maximum levels; from this point on, however, a slight  decrease in HbA1c 
response occurred, with  a magnitude  almost identical in  the EQW and placebo groups, suggesting that the 
decrease in HbA1c response reflects the natural course of the disease rather than the presence of 
antibodies. HbA1c is an integrated response requiring sustained time of drug exposure (8 to 12 weeks) to 
manifest changes while changes in anti-drug antibody titre  are more immediate. The maximum increase 
in HbA1c beyond 12 weeks may be a delayed reflection of the peak antibod y titre at 12  weeks.   
Analysis of efficacy in the  open-label  extension period 
Change  in HbA1c from Baseline  Visit 2 (Week  0) to Visit 10 (Week  52), and to Each 
Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
In the EQW group, the reduction in mean HbA1c observed within the  first 24 weeks of EQW treatment 
gradually diminished over time, returning  to approximate baseline levels by Week  52. Mean HbA1c 
decreased from baseline through  Week 12 of the study (mean change from baseline of -0.74%),  and then 
began to gradually increase, returning to approximate baseline levels by Week  52  (mean change from 
baseline of -0.10%).   
In the placebo → EQW group, mean HbA1c remained stable from baseline through Week  12 (mean 
change from baseline of 0.10%),  and then began to gradually increas e through Week 24  (mean change

from baseline of 0.53%).  When the  patients were switched to  treatment with  EQW during the  open-label 
extension period, mean HbA1c  decreased through Week  40  (mean change from baseline of 0.00%)  and 
increased through Week 52  (mean change from baseline of 0.53%). 
Change  in Fasting Plasma Glucose Concentration from Baseline  Visit 2 (Week  0) to Visit 10 
(Week  52), and to Each Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
In the EQW group, the reduction in mean FPG observed with the first 24 weeks gradually diminished over 
time, returning to  approximate baseline levels by Week  52. Mean FPG decreased from baseline through 
Week 4 of the study (mean change from baseline of -1.97 mol/L),  and then began to increase through 
Week 52 (mean change from baseline of -0.10  mol/L).  
In the placebo → EQW group, mean FPG decreased from baseline through Week 12  (mean change from 
baseline of -0.05  mol/L), and then increased through Week 24 (mean change from baseline of 1.09 
mol/L). When the  patients were switched  to treatment with  EQW during the open-label extension period, 
mean FPG decreased through Week 52  (mean change from baseline of 0.59  mol/L).   
Change  in Body Weight  from Baseline  Visit 2 (Week  0) to Visit 10 (Week  52), and  to each 
Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
In the EQW group, the reduction in mean body weight  observed with the first 24 weeks of EQW treatment 
gradually diminished over time, returning  to approximate baseline levels by Week  52. Mean body weight 
decreased from baseline through  Week 12 of the  study (mean change from baseline of -0.95  kg), and 
then began to increase through Week 24  (mean change from baseline of -0.53  kg). Mean body weight 
remained relatively stable through Week 40  (mean change from baseline of -0.45  kg) and had returned 
to approximate baseline levels by Week 52  (mean change from baseline of 0.04  kg).  
In the placebo → EQW group, mean body weight  increased from baseline through  Week  8 (mean change 
from baseline of 0.99  kg), and then remained relatively stable until  Week  24 (mean change from baseline 
of 0.77 kg). When the patients  were switched to treatment  with  EQW during the  open-label extension 
period, mean body weight  remained stable through Week 28  (mean change from baseline of 0.79   kg) and 
then decreased to approximate baseline levels by Week 52 (mean change from baseline of -0.04 kg). 
Change  in Fasting Insulin from Baseline  Visit 2 (Week  0) to Visit 10 (Week  52), and to each 
Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
In the EQW group, the increase in fasting insulin  observed at Week 24  of EQW treatment diminished over 
time, and a decrease from baseline in fasting insulin  was observed through Week  52.  Mean fasting insulin 
fluctuated from baseline through  Week 24 (mean change from baseline of 24.0 pmol/L). Levels continued 
to fluctuate  through Week 52 (mean change from baseline of -32.4  pmol/L) but were generally associated 
with  a decrease from baseline.  
In the placebo → EQW group, mean fasting insulin fluctuated  from baseline through Week  24 (mean 
change from baseline of 37.3  pmol/L). When patients were switched to treatment with  EQW during the 
open-label extension period, levels continued  to fluctuate through  Week  52 (mean change from baseline 
of 121.5 pmol/L)  but were generally associated with an increase from baseline. 
Proportions of Patients Achieving HbA1c Goals at Visit 10 (Week  52), and  at Each Intermediate 
Visit as Applicable 
In the EQW group, the proportions of patients  achieving HbA1c goals with  the first 24 weeks of EQW 
treatment were sustained through Week 52. The proportions of patients  achieving HbA1c goals at Week 
24 (22.9%,  22.9%,  and 37.5% of patients achieving HbA1c goals of < 6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%, and < 7%, 
respectively) were maintained through Week 52,  with  30.8%, 30.8%,  and 35.9% achieving HbA1c goals 
of < 6.5%, ≤  6.5%, and < 7%, respectively.

In the placebo → EQW group, the  proportion of patients that  achieved HbA1c goals of <  6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%, 
and < 7% at Week 24 was 4.5%, 4.5%,  and 9.1%,  respectively. When patients were switched  to 
treatment with  EQW during the open-label extension period, the proportion of patients  achieving all 
3 HbA1c goals increased at Week 40 through  Week 52. At Week 52,  the  proportion of patients  who 
achieved HbA1c goals of < 6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%,  and <  7% were 23.5%,  23.5%,  and 29.4%. 
Change  in Blood Pressure (Systolic and Diastolic) from Baseline  Visit 2 (Week  0) to Visit 10 
(Week  52), and to Each Intermediate  Visit as Applicable 
Systolic Blood Pressure 
In the EQW group, the reduction in mean SBP observed with the first 24  weeks of EQW  treatment 
gradually diminished over time, returning  to approximate baseline levels by Week  52. Mean SBP 
decreased from baseline through  Week 4 of the   study (mean change from baseline of -2.4  mmHg), 
remained relatively stable from Week 4  through Week  18 (mean change from baseline of -2.3 mmHg), 
began to increase through Week 40 (mean change from baseline of 1.2 mmHg),  and then decreased to 
approximate baseline levels by Week 52 (mean change from baseline of -0.7 mmHg).   
In the placebo → EQW group, mean SBP fluctuated from baseline to Week  12  (mean change from 
baseline of 0.9 mmHg),  then increased to Week 18  and remained stable through  Week  24 (mean change 
from baseline of 2.3  mmHg). When the  patients were switched  to treatment with  EQW during the  open-
label extension period, mean SBP decreased through Week 40 (mean change from baseline 
of -1.9 mmHg)  and then  increased to approximate baseline levels by Wee k 52 (mean change from 
baseline of -0.6 mmHg).   
Diastolic Blood Pressure 
In the EQW group, there were no notable changes in mean DBP from baseline to Week  24. However, from 
Week 28 through  Week 52, there was a predominant increase in mean DBP from baseline  (mean change 
from baseline of 1.1  mmHg at Week 52). 
In the placebo → EQW group, there were no notable changes in mean DBP from baseline to Week 24. 
However, when the  patients were switched  to treatment with  EQW during the open -label extension

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This variation concerns the paediatric population and includes data on adolescents and children >10 years 
of age. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study BCB114 was Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, international  study that 
included male and female patients  10 to 17 years of age with  T2DM treated with  diet and exercise alone 
or in combination with  a stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin  for at least 2 months  prior 
to screening.  
The study duration was 62 weeks (excluding the extended safety follow -up period; see below) and 
comprised 4 periods: screening period (5 weeks), controlled assessment period (24 weeks): double -blind, 
placebo-controlled period to  examine the efficacy and safety of EQW  compared with placebo, extension 
period (28  weeks): open-label, uncontrolled period to examine the long-term safety and efficacy of EQW 
and post-treatment follow-up  period (10 weeks). 
For the controlled assessment period, patients were randomly assigned in a 5:2 ratio to receive either 
EQW 2 mg (Group A) or placebo (Group B). During the  extension period (Week  25 through Week 52), 
patients assigned to the EQW 2 mg treatment (Group A) continued to be treated with EQW  2 mg, and 
patients randomized to  placebo (Group B) received EQW 2 mg. The trial design is considered adequate. 
The selection of patients was adequate, in order to recruit a repre sentative study population.  The 
exclusion criteria included concomitant medications and conditions  that might  have rendered the 
interpretation of data difficult.  Other exclusion criteria were in place to for the safety of the patients.  The 
objectives as well as the primary and secondary endpoints were adequate. 
The primary endpoint change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was  compared between the treatment 
groups (EQW versus placebo) using the MMRM  analysis. The main estimand was based on  a hypothetical 
strategy which excluded observations after intercurrent events defined as receipt of rescue therapy, study 
medication discontinuation,  and study withdrawal.  This strategy may have over-estimated the treatment 
effect, depending on the amount  and distribution  o f missing and/or excluded data. Specifically, a 
considerably higher treatment discontinuation  rate was seen in the  EQW treatment group, which is not 
accounted for in the  primary estimand. More emphasis should therefore be given to the sensitivity and 
supplementary analyses that  were based on the treatment  policy approach using available data and/or 
imputation  methods that are conservative for the comparison between the treatment groups (such as the 
applied copy-reference approach). 
Missingness patterns were presented for completeness, showing  no obvious trends other than several 
patients with  missing data for 3 to 4 consecutive visits in the EQW  group while none in the placebo group, 
which indicates the more pronounced study withdrawals in the  EQW group.  The Applicant also provided

requested presentation of number of excluded observations due to different reasons, including missing 
data, in total  and per visit for each treatment group in the primary as well as sensitivity and 
supplementary analysis of the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24.  Missing data were 
predominantly missing due to not  being available/observed (e.g., lost to  follow -up or withdrawal  by 
subject, as shown  in the subsection Participant flow) and not due to intercurrent events. There wer e only 
few patients excluded due to intercurrent events of treatment  discontinuation and rescue intake; at most 
2 such observations were reported per visit in the EQW treatment  group and none in the placebo group in 
the primary analysis and sensitivity analysis. Disappointingly, the MAH  did not provide the  results 
according to  the two methods which were specified in the SAP to  examine the missingness patterns by 
assessing the pre- and post-withdrawal values of HbA1c. The issue will though  not be further pursued, 
considering that  the primary endpoint  results were supported by sensitivity analysis where 
missing/excluded observations for the EQW group were assumed to be MNAR and imputed  using copy-
reference approach (i.e., modelled by observed outcomes from the placebo group). 
It is noted that  the primary analysis did not  include the  same stratification factors as used in the 
randomisation; this will  not be pursued. 
The hierarchical testing strategy for the  primary and secondary variables is endorsed.  
Subgroup analysis was performed only in terms of descriptive statistics with  no graphical presentation or 
direct comparison between the treatment groups. For the ease of the assessment and illustration  of 
consistency of the treatment  effects across the subgroups, a  forest plot for the primary endpoint was 
provided on request, by subgroups according to sex, age, baseline HbA1c,  BMI percentile, region and 
race. All points estimates are in favour of Bydureon, which  is reassuring.  
The study appears to be adequately conducted. None of the  reported protocol deviations are thought  to 
have significantly affected the results of the  study. 
The demographic, patient and baseline disease characteristics were representative of the  intended 
population. These parameters were broadly similar between the EQW and placebo groups, taking into 
account the small size of the study. Minor  imbalances were observed for age, sex, race, region, weight 
population percentile, and baseline diabetes duration. 
Notably, study subjects were overweight, with  a mean weight of 100  kg and mean BMI of 36 kg/m 2. No 
difference was observed in terms of pre-existing conditions and concomitant  medications between study 
groups.  A greater proportion of patients in the  EQW were in the ≥  97 percentile for weight compared 
with  the placebo group. During the assessment of study BCB114 as part of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002020/P46,  the Applicant was invited to discuss whether the imbalance in weight population 
percentiles between the study groups may have influenced the study r esults due to potential  differences 
in exposure to study drug. According to the  applicant, the differences in weight population  percentiles 
between the EQW and placebo groups are unlikely to  have influenced study results due to differences in 
study drug exposure. Higher body weight  results in lower plasma concentrations of exenatide; however, 
the PD effect, change in HbA1c, due to lower pharmacokinetics (PK) is minimal (< 0.1%)  and not of 
clinical importance. Thus,  the conclusion by the applicant that  any m inor differences in weight  population 
percentiles between treatment groups would unlikely impact the study results is endorsed, and the issue 
is not further pursued. 
Compliance was generally high and similar between treatment  groups in both  during the 24 -week 
controlled assessment period and the 52-week open-label treatment period.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study BCB114 met the  primary endpoint, showing a difference in HbA1c of -0.85%  (p = 0.012)  in 
favour of the EQW group after 24  weeks, and the sensitivity analyses support the primary analysis. The 
difference is considered clinically relevant. The difference in HbA1c between study groups increased 
gradually until  week 12  and was then maintained throughout  the rest of the controlled phase (week 24). 
The LS mean change in HbA1c was -0.36% for the EQW group and 0.49% for the placebo group. Of note, 
even though  the difference in HbA1c was sustained, HbA1c g radually increased in both  groups after week 
12. 
The difference in the secondary endpoint FPG was not  statistically significant but  still in  favour of the  EQW 
group. The reduction in  body weight  was greater for the EQW group throughout  the whole study. A 
similar trend was seen for BMI. There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in 
fasting insulin  at week 24. 
The proportion of patients  achieving HbA1c goals (<  6.5%, ≤ 6.5%,  and < 7.0%)  was 15  to 23 % higher 
in the EQW group vs placebo. None of the other secondary and or exploratory endpoints rendered any 
meaningful difference between study groups (lipids, blood pressure).  
Antibodies to exenatide were observed in the majority of patients  (93.0%)  in the EQW group at any time 
during the study, and 63%  had a high titer.  According to the  SmPC, approximately 45% of adult patients 
had low titer antibodies to exenatide at study endpoint, and 12% had high antibody titers.  The proportion 
of adolescents/children with  high antibody titers and potentially loss of efficacy is thus  higher than  in the 
reference population. According to the MAH,  the generally lower anti -drug antibody incidence and titers in 
adults with  T2DM compared with  the adolescent patients  with  T2DM in Study BCB114 may be due to 
immune aging. 
Moreover, study subjects with lower antibody titers had a better outcome at week 24, as the mean 
change from baseline in HbA1c  in the EQW group was greater in patients with  low positive antibodies 
(-0.73%)  compared with  those with high  positive antibodies (0.07%).  However, no direct correlation 
between change in  HbA1c and antibody titer  can be observed, as these parameters evolve in a different 
time manner.  
Even though there seem to be a trend towards reduced magnitude of mean changes from baseline in 
HbA1c with  higher anti-drug antibody titer categories, the  high variability of the available data precludes 
any firm conclusion. Since, according to the MAH,  no commercial antibody test for exenatide is available 
at the moment, testing  of anti-drug antibodies is not possible in clinical practice. Indeed, some patients 
may experience a lower HbA1c decrease due to high  antibody titers. Strategies such as a stopping rule 
could possibly prevent patients with  suboptimal treatment responses from unnecessary lo ng treatment 
duration, taking into  account that the HbA1c-lowering  effect is relatively modest (-0.36%).  The Applicant 
has further analysed the change in HbA1c by antibody titers during the  study. The Applicant concludes 
that  the mean reduction in HbA1c  seem decrease with increasing antibody titres. However, no prediction 
can be done in the individual patient.  Because no commercial test  for ADA is available, the decision 
whether to continue treatment  with  Bydureon should be made by the clinician based on th e observed 
HbA1c reduction and the achievement of the individual HbA1c goal in each patient.  
A wording on how to guide the clinician in case lack or loss of efficacy has been included in  section 4.4  of 
the SmPC. 
Efficacy outcomes were also evaluated in the open-label extension period. The reduction in mean HbA1c, 
FPG and body weight  observed with the first 24  weeks of EQW treatment  gradually diminished over time, 
returning to approximate baseline levels by Week 52.  Likewise, the  increase in fasting insulin observed at 
Week 24 of EQW treatment diminished over time,  and a decrease from baseline in fa sting  insulin was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 53/71 
 
 
 
 
observed through Week 52. On the  other hand, the  proportions of patients achieving HbA1c goals 
(<6.5%, ≤6.5%,  and <7%)  with  the first 24 weeks of EQW treatment  were sustained through Week 52. 
The patients that  switched from placebo to EQW at week 24  showed an initial  decrease in HbA1c up to 
week 40,  but then the  HbA1c appeared to increase again. It is, however, noted  that the number of 
patients achieving the treatment goals in this group increased from 4.5-9.1%  at week 24 to 23.5-29.4% 
at week 52.  However, as clarified by the Applicant, study BCB114 was not  designed to determine the 
long-term effect of EQW compared to placebo in the paediatric population.  Only patients  randomised to 
EQW in the 24-weeks randomized period continued  treatment with  EQW up to week 52,  the latter period 
without  comparator. The return of mean HbA1c towards baseline observed at Week 52 may be due  a 
faster deterioration of β-cell function in paediatric subjects with  T2D , following the natural course of the 
disease, which may have influenced the study result as seen in other paediatric T2D studies.  Thus, no 
firm conclusion can be made on the long-term efficacy of EQW based on data from the  current study. 
There were no consistent  changes in SBP or DBP over time, neither  in the  EQW group or the placebo → 
EQW group. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study BCB114 was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Bydureon in children and adolescents 10 
to 17 years of age with  T2DM treated with  diet and exercise alone or in combination  with a stable dose of 
oral antidiabetic  agents and/or insulin. 
The effect of EQW on the primary endpoint was statistically  and clinically relevant and the outcome is 
supported by the  secondary endpoints. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The efficacy and safety of Bydureon adults  18 years and older with  T2DM have been documented in the 
clinical development program for exenatide. 
• 
In paediatric T2DM patients,  safety and tolerability data from one clinical study support this 
submission, Study BCB114, in  children with  10 to  17 years of age with  T2DM, with  a 24-weeks 
double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed by a 28-weeks open-labelled uncontrolled period 
to examine the long-term safety and efficacy of EQW. 
Patient exposure 
A summary of the  extent of exposure for the controlled assessment period is presented in  Table 17. 
In the controlled assessment period, the mean duration of EQW/placebo exposure was simi lar between 
the EQW and placebo groups (157.3  and 165.6  days, respectively). For the whole study period, the mean 
duration of EQW exposure was longer in the EQW group (356.7  days) than the  placebo → EQW group 
(161.1  days), as expected. The majority of patients in the EQW group were exposed to exenatide for ≥ 
364 days (76.0%),  while the majority of patients in  the placebo → EQW group were exposed to exenatide 
for 168 to 223  days (72.7%).

Controlled assessment period AE was defined as an AE starting on or after day of first dose of study medication up to 
but not including Week 24 for patients entering the open-label extension period. For patients not entering the open-label 
extension period, the period was defined as up to and including last dose of study medication + 7 days (+ 90 days for 
SAEs and other clinically significant or related AEs). 
Open-label extension period AE was defined as an AE starting on or after day of first dose of open -label EQW to last 
dose + 7 days (+ 90 days for SAEs and other clinically significant or related AEs). 
Events were captured up to the later of period definition or Week 52, where patients completed treatment. 
Percentages were calculated from the number of patients in the analysis set for the study period by treatment group.

AE, adverse event; EQW, exenatide 2 mg once weekly; N, number of patients in treatment group; SAE, serious AE. 
Exenatide was generally well-tolerated in adolescents with  T2DM and safety findings in this study were 
consistent with  the known safety profile of the product. There were no AEs with  an outcome of dea th or 
AEs leading to  treatment or study discontinuation  reported during  the study.  
The incidence of AEs overall was generally lower in the EQW group (61.0%)  than the placebo group  
(73.9%)  during the controlled assessment period. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity 
throughout  the whole study. 
Adverse events by system organ class and preferred term  
The most common AEs were upper respiratory tract infection and abdo minal pain in the  EQW and placebo 
groups, respectively (Table 19). The incidence of AEs overall was generally lower in the open-label 
extension period than the controlled assessment period.

During the controlled assessment period, the most common AEs by SOC in both the EQW and placebo 
groups were: infections and infestations (16 patients  [27.1%]  and 5  patients [21.7%],  respectively), 
gastrointestinal disorders (13  patients [22.0%]  and 6 patients [26.1%],  respectively), and metabolism 
and nutrition  disorders (7 patients [11.9%]  and 2 patients [8.7%],  respectively).  
During the open-label extension period, the most  common AEs by SOC in both the EQ W and placebo → 
EQW groups were infections and infestations (10 patients  [20.0%]  and 6  patients [27.3%],  respectively) 
and gastrointestinal disorders (6 patients  [12.0%] and 3 patients  [13.6%],  respectively).  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
During the controlled assessment period, the proportions of patients with  gastrointestinal disorder -related 
AEs overall were slightly lower in the EQW group than the placebo group (13  patients [22.0%])  and 6 
patients [26.1%],  respectively). 
The following gastrointestinal disorder PTs were reported in  a higher proportion of patients  in the EQW 
group compared with the  placebo group: 
•  Diarrhoea: 5 patients (8.5%)  versus 1 patient (4.3%),  respectively  
•  Nausea: 4 patients (6.8%)  versus 1 patient (4.3%),  respectiv ely 
•  Vomiting: 3 patients  (5.1%) versus 0 patients,  respectively  
•  Upper abdominal pain: 3 patients  (5.1%) versus 0  patients, respectively  
None of the gastrointestinal disorder-related AEs in the EQW group led to  study drug discontinuation and 
the majority were mild or moderate in intensity with  most resolving during the  study. Only the  severe 
event of irritable bowel syndrome reported in the placebo group during the  controlled assessment period 
was considered serious. 
During the open-label extension period, the proportions of patients with  gastrointestinal disorder -related 
AEs overall in both the EQW and placebo →  EQW groups (6 patients  [12.0%]  and 3 patients  [13.6%],

During the controlled assessment period, hypoglycaemic events were reported in 8 patients (13.6%)  and 
1 patient  (4.3%) in the  EQW and placebo groups, respectively. Of the events reported, there w ere no 
major hypoglycaemic events. The proportion of patients  with  minor hypoglycaemic events was low and 
similar between the  treatment groups: 1 patient (1.7%)  with  1 event in the  EQW group compared with  1 
patient (4.3%)  with  1 event in the placebo group. 
Other hypoglycaemic events (which did not  meet the  criteria for major or minor episodes) were reported 
in 8 patients  (13.6%),  with a total  of 12  events, in the EQW group and 1 patient  (4.3%), with  a total of 6

Among the 8 patients with  hypoglycaemic events in the EQW group, insulin  use at baseline was reported 
for the majority of patients (6 of 8 patients),  while no insulin or SU use at  baseline was reported for the

remaining patients (2 of 8 patients).  For the 1 patient with  hypoglycaemic events in the  placebo group, 
insulin use at baseline was reported. 
During the open-label extension period, hypoglycaemic events were reported in 4 patients (8.0%)  in the 
EQW group and 1 patient (4.5%)  in the placebo →  EQW group. Of the  events reported, there were no 
major hypoglycaemic events. 
In the EQW group, the incidence of patients  with minor hypoglycaemia was similar between the treatment 
periods.

Injection site reactions are presented from the AE eCRF, based on the “Injection site reactions” higher level terms. 
Controlled assessment period AE was defined as an AE starting on or after day of first dose of study medication up to 
but not including Week 24 for patients entering the open-label extension period. For patients not entering the open-label 
extension period, the period was defined as up to and including last dose of study medication + 7 days (+ 90 days for 
SAEs and other clinically significant or related AEs). 
For patients completing controlled assessment period treatment but not entering the open -label extension period, events 
were captured up to the later of period definition or Week 24. 
Percentages were calculated from the number of patients with data available at the respective visit by treatment group.

analysis; SAE, serious adverse event. 
During the controlled assessment period, the proportions of patients with  AEs of injection site reactions 
were generally low and comparable between the EQW and placebo group. In both the EQW and placebo 
groups, injection site reactions occurred most freque ntly at Week 4 (5 patients  [8.5%] and 2 patients 
[8.7%],  respectively), then gradually diminished over time. No injection site reactions were reported after 
Week 12 in  either treatment  group. 
During the open-label phase of the  treatment period, the  incidence of AEs of injection site reactions was 
low (2 patients  [4.0%] in the  EQW group only). 
All AEs of injection site reactions were reported in patients  using the prefilled syringe device (no injection 
site reactions were reported in patients  using the dual chamber pen device) and were mild in intensity; 
none met the criteria for a SAE.

Number (%) of patients who reported at least 1 potentially immune-related AE for a PT, sorted by international 
order for SOC and alphabetically for PT. A patient could have 1 or more PTs reported under a given SOC. 
One patient who was randomly assigned to placebo received a dose of EQW in error and was subsequently 
reassigned to the EQW group for analyses based on actual treatment (see CSR Section 10.3); however, no 
antibody result was available for this patient as a ntibody results were not collected for patients randomly assigned 
to placebo (see CSR Section 9.9.2). 
An antibody was said to be positive if tested positive at any time (pre- and postbaseline). Otherwise, patients who had 
all available results as negative were categorized as such. 
Baseline antibody titer was the measurement at Week 0 (Day 1). A negative or missing measurement was considered 
negative at baseline.  
Controlled assessment period AE was defined as an AE starting on or after day of first dose of study medication up to 
but not including Week 24 for patients entering the open-label extension period. For patients not entering the open-label 
extension period, the period was defined as up to and including last dose of study medication + 7 days (+ 90 da ys for 
SAEs and other clinically significant or related AEs). 
For patients completing controlled assessment period treatment but not entering the open -label extension period, events 
were captured up to the later of period definition or Week 24. 
Percentages were calculated from the number of patients in the analysis set by treatment group by antibody status.

During the controlled assessment period for the EQW group, potentially immune -related AEs were more 
common among patients who  were positive for exenatide antibodies (10.9%)  compared with  patients who 
were negative (0%).

Of the patients who developed positive antibody status, potentially immune -related AEs were reported for 
a similar proportion of patients with  a higher titer  (10.8%)  and with  a low titer (11.1%).  The most 
common potentially  immune-related AEs were injection site erythema, reported in 3 EQW patients (8.1%) 
with  a higher titer,  and injection site pruritus, reported for 1 EQW patient (2.7%)  with  a higher titer  and 1 
EQW patient  (5.6%) with  a low titer. 
During the open-label extension period, potentially immune-related AEs were reported for 4 patients 
(8.2%)  in the EQW group who were all positive for exenatide antibodies. No  patients were negative for 
exenatide antibodies and, therefore, no comparison could be made. 
Of the patients who developed positive antibody status, potentially immune -related AEs were reported for 
a similar proportion of patients with  a higher titer  (8.6%) and with  a low titer (7.1%).  At the PT level, 
none of the  potentially immune-related AEs were reported by more than  1 patient. 
None of the potentially immune-related AEs were considered serious or led to study drug discontinuation.  
Vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical findings and other observatio ns related to safety 
Treatment with  EQW was associated with a small but notable reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 
small increase in heart rate. Of note, there were no AEs of hypotension or tachycardia reported during the 
study. No other clinically meaningful trends in vital signs over time or notable differences between 
treatment groups in vital sign parameters were observed. There were no new safety concerns related to 
vital signs.  
Tanner Pubertal Stage 
Development and growth assessed by Tanner staging resulted in  comparable results for patients treated 
with  EQW and placebo during the controlled assessment period. 
At Week 24,  an overall Tanner stage of V was reported for the  majority of patients treated with  EQW or 
placebo (71.7%  and 76.2%, respectively). Overall Tanner stage results at Week 52  were consistent with 
those observed at Week 24 for the treatment groups. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
During the controlled assessment period, the majority of AEs were mild  or moderate in intensity.  One 
patient (1.7%)  in the  EQW group and 2 patients  (8.7%) in the  placebo group reported at least 1 severe 
AE. Of the severe AEs reported, 1 event of major depr ession in the EQW group and 1 event of irritable 
bowel syndrome in the placebo group were considered serious but  neither led to treatment or study 
discontinuation. 
There were no deaths reported during the study. No discontinuations  of study  treatment due t o an AE 
were reported during the study. 
The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) was low and comparable between the EQW and placebo groups 
during the controlled assessment period (Table 23). No  SAEs were reported by more than  1 patient in  the 
EQW or placebo groups and none were considered related to study medication by the  Investigator. 
Similar results were observed for patients with  SAEs during the open -label extension period.

Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters over time and no notable differences 
between treatment groups in laboratory parameters. No patients met the criteria for a potential  Hy’s Law 
case. 
Individual Clinically Important Changes in Clinical Chemistry Variables 
Abnormal results were observed in a higher number of patients in the  EQW group than  the placebo group 
(between group difference of ≥ 5  patients) for the following parameters:  
•  AST: high  values were reported in  5 patients (9.1%)  in the EQW group and 0 patients in the 
placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 62/71 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Creatinine: low values were reported in 7 patients (12.7%)  in the EQW group and 2 patients 
(8.7%)  in the placebo group. 
• 
Phosphate: high values were reported in 8 patients (14.5%)  in the  EQW group and  1 patient 
(4.3%)  in the placebo group. 
• 
Lipase: high values were reported in 9 patients (16.7%)  in the  EQW group and 0 patients  in the 
placebo group. 
Carcinoembryonic Antigen 
There were no clinically notable changes in  mean values from baseline to Week 12  for carcinoembryonic 
antigen within  the treatment  groups (-0.06  µg/L  and 0.01  µg/L for the EQW and placebo → EQW  groups, 
respectively). No notable changes in mean values for carcinoembryonic antigen were observed within  the 
treatment groups for the  remainder of the treatment  period. 
One patient in the EQW  group reported an AE of carcinoembryonic antigen increased during the off -
treatment period.  Serum calcitonin levels were undetectable (<  2 ng/L) throughout  the study, and per 
the Investigator, the patient had no evidence of any medical condition that  would result in elevated 
carcinoembryonic antigen. 
Pancreatic amylase 
While there was a small numerical increase with  EQW versus placebo at Week 12, there were no clinically 
notable changes in mean values from baseline to Week 12 for pancreatic amylase within  the treatment 
groups (3.6 U/L  [0.061 µkat/L]  and 0.5 U/L  [0.008 µkat/L]  for the  EQW and placebo → EQW groups, 
respectively). No notable changes in mean values for pancreatic amylase were observed wi thin the 
treatment groups for the  remainder of the treatment  period. 
No pancreatic-related AEs were reported for either treatment group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No AEs leading to study medication or study discontinuation  by the investigator w ere reported. 
Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively through  31 March 2020,  worldwide post-marketing exposure to EQW for adults is estimated 
to be 2128373  patient-years and post-marketing exposure to EQWS is estimated to be 149964  patient-
years. 
Based on a review of the  available post-marketing data for adults, the safety profile of EQW/EQWS 
remains generally similar to the profile established during clinical studies.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This variation concerns the paediatric population,  i.e., ado lescents and children >10  years of age. 
The safety database is limited to  59 subjects treated with  EQW for a mean of 157.3 days in the controlled 
assessment period and 72  subjects treated with  EQW in the extension period (EQW group and placebo → 
EQW group). For the whole study period, the mean duration of EQW exposure was longer in the  EQW 
group (356.7 days) than the placebo → EQW group (161.1 days), as expected.  
Assessment report

Exenatide prolonged release was generally well-tolerated in adolescents with  T2DM. Safety findings in this 
study were consistent  with the  known safety profile of the drug in the  adult population. In the controlled 
assessment period, the incidence of AEs overall was lower in the EQW group vs placebo (61% vs 74%). 
The incidence of SAEs was also low, with in  total 7 events reported for the  entire study  period. In the 
controlled assessment period, 2 subjects (3.4%)  in the EQW group reported a SAE compared to 
3 subjects (4.3%) in  the placebo treated group. In the  extension period, a total  of 4 SAEs were reported. 
None of the SAEs were considered related to treatment  by the Investigator. In the controlled assessment 
period, the  reporting of treatment related AEs was slightly  higher in  the EQW group (15 subjects; 25.4%) 
compared to the placebo group (5 subjects; 21.7%). 
The most common AE reported in the  EQW group were upper respiratory tract infection (10.2%)  whereas 
abdominal pain was the most common AE reported in the  placebo group (13.0%).  Most  AEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity.  The incidence of GI-related AEs was comparable between the EQW and placebo 
groups (22.0% and 26.1%)  during the controlled assessment period . The most frequent gastrointestinal 
disorder-related AEs were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain . These events were 
more frequently reported in the EQW group. 
There were no major hypoglycaemic events reported during the study. The occurrence of any 
hypoglycaemic event was somewhat higher in  the EQW group (8 subjects; 13.6%) than  in the placebo 
group (1 subject; 4.3%),  out of which one minor hypoglycaemia was reported in each of the study 
groups.  
The proportions of patients experiencing injection site reactions was low  and comparable between the 
study groups. No injection site reactions were reported after Week 1 2. Of note, all injection-site reactions 
were reported among patients  using the prefilled syringe device.  
Out of 55 patients  who were positive (n=55)  for exenatide antibodies, 6 patients  reported a potentially 
immune-related AE, compared to no events reported by the 3 patients who were negative. It should also 
be noted that 3  subjects in the  placebo group reported potentially immune -related AEs. The relationship 
between the timing  of the  development of ADA and the  development of a potentially immune -related AE 
is however inconsistent, thus  there is no clear association between the two. 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters over time and no notable differences 
between treatment groups. No patients met the  criteria for a potentia l  Hy’s Law case. 
Treatment with  EQW was associated with a small but notable reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 
small increase in heart rate but  here were no AEs of hypotension or tachycardia reported during the 
study. Development and growth assesse d by Tanner staging was similar between study groups. 
In summary, the safety profile does not  appear to differ from what is known from the  use of exenatide in 
adults. No  new safety concerns arise from the data submitted. The safety database is  however limited 
and no data beyond 52 weeks is available. However, there is no scientific rationale for anticipating  a 
different safety profile for long-term use in paediatric patients.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Exenatide was generally well-tolerated in paediatric patients aged 10  to 17 years with  T2DM. The safety 
findings in study BCB114 were consistent  with  those observed in the adult  population with  T2DM in the 
currently approved label. No new safety concerns arise from the data presented. Furtherm ore, there is no 
scientific rationale for anticipating  a different safety profile for long -term use in paediatric patients.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, and the main driver is the increased 
prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Childhood T2DM is still  relatively rare in Eu rope, with a 
prevalence of approximately 2.5 per 100 thousand. 
Developing T2DM at a younger age is associated with  a considerably higher risk of long -term 
cardiovascular disease compared with those who develop T2DM in the middle age. The rapid deterioratio n 
in glucose regulation in  children as compared with  adults may contribute  to the greater risk for micro - 
and macrovascular complications in children with T2DM as they develop into adults.  
The indication is extended to include “adolescents and children aged 10 years and above”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 65/71 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Management of T2DM in children involves lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic glucose -lowering 
treatment is often necessary and includes metformin or insulin  or a combination of both. Recen tly, a 
GPL1-RA (liraglutide)  has been approved for the  use in children aged 10  or older.  
The rapid progression of T2DM in children in terms of beta ‐cell function deterioration, time to treatment 
failure and development of complications, with  associated poo r glycaemic control, calls for an urgent need 
for additional effective, well tolerated and easily administered treatments to achieve and maintain target 
HbA1c levels as early as possible in children with T2DM. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study BCB114 was Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, international  study that 
included male and female patients  10 to 17 years of age with  T2DM treated with  diet and exercise alone 
or in combination with  a stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insuli n  for at least 2 months  prior 
to screening.  
The study included patients with  an HbA1c of 6.5% to 11.0%,  inclusive, in patients not taking insulin/SU, 
and with  an HbA1c  of 6.5%  to 12.0%,  inclusive, in  patients taking insulin/SU, at  screening, and patients 
with  a C-peptide of > 0.6  ng/mL at screening. 
The study comprised 4 periods: a screening period (5 weeks); a double -blind, placebo-controlled 
assessment period (24  weeks); an open-label, uncontrolled extension period (28  weeks); and a post-
treatment follow-up period (10 weeks).  
The primary efficacy objective of the  study was to  assess the effect on glycaemic control, as measured by 
HbA1c, of EQW following 24 weeks of treatment  compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints included 
FPG, body weight,  fasting insulin,  the percentage of patients requiring rescue treatment and the 
percentage of patients who achieving HbA1c goals (< 6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%  and < 7.0%). The primary and 
secondary efficacy objectives were assessed at Week 24, but also exploratively at Week 52, to  assess the 
long-term trend of glycaemic control. 
A total of 83 patients (EQW,  59; placebo, 24)  10 to 17  years of age were randomized and 82 (EQW, 58; 
placebo, 24)  received treatment during  the 24-week controlled assessment period. A total  of 72  patients 
(EQW, 49;  placebo, 23) received treatment with  EQW during the 28-week open-label extension period. 
The demographic, patient and baseline disease characteristics were representative of the  intended 
population. Compliance was generally high and similar betwee n treatment groups in both during the 24-
week controlled assessment period and the 52-week open-label treatment  period. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study BCB114 met the  primary endpoint, showing a LS mean difference in change in HbA1c from 
baseline of -0.85%  (95%CI: -1.51,  -0.19; p = 0.012)  in favour of the EQW group after 24 weeks. The 
sensitivity analyses support the primary analysis. Treatment with  EQW led to an adjusted mean change 
from baseline (LS mean) in  HbA1c of -0.36%,  whereas the  HbA1c in the placebo treated group increased 
by 0.49%.  
The proportion of patients  achieving HbA1c goals (<  6.5%, ≤ 6.5%,  and < 7.0%)  was 15  to 23 % higher 
in the EQW group vs placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 66/71 
 
 
 
 
The LS mean difference in the secondary endpoint FPG (-1.20  mmol/L, 95%CI: -2.72,  0.32) was not 
statistically significant  but numerically in  favour of the  EQW group.  
The reduction in body weight  was numerically greater for the  EQW group (-0.59  kg vs +0.63  kg in the 
placebo group) throughout  the whole study. A similar trend was seen for  BMI.  
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in fasting insulin  at week 24.  
None of the other secondary endpoints (lipids,  blood pressure) rendered any meaningful difference 
between study groups.  
Efficacy outcomes were also evaluated in the open-label extension period. In the EQW  treated group, 
mean HbA1c  decreased from baseline through Week  12 of the study,  and then  began to  gradually 
increase, returning to approximate baseline levels by Week  52  (mean change from baseline of -0.10%). 
The reduction in FPG and body weight  observed with the first 24 weeks of EQW treatment  gradually 
diminished over time, returning to approximate baseline levels by Week 52.  
The proportions of patients achieving HbA1c goals (<6.5%, ≤6.5%,  and <7%) with  the first 24  weeks of 
EQW treatment were sustained through Week 52.  
The patients that  switched from placebo to EQW at week 24  showed an in itial  decrease in HbA1c up to 
week 40,  but then the  HbA1c appeared to increase again. The number of patients  achieving the treatment 
goals in  this group increased from 4.5-9.1%  at week 24 to 23.5-29.4%  at week 52.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Antibodies to exenatide were observed in the majority of patients  (93.0%)  in the EQW group at any time 
during the study, and 63%  had a high titer.  The neutralising capacity of these antibodies has not  been 
investigated. According to the  SmPC, approximately 45% of adult patients had low titer  antibodies to 
exenatide at study endpoint,  and 12%  had high antibody titers. The proportion of adolescents/children 
with  high antibody titers and potentially loss of efficacy is thus  higher than in the adu lt  population. The 
mean reduction in  HbA1c seem to decrease with increasing antibody titres.  However, no prediction can be 
done in the individual patient.  Because no commercial test for ADA is available, the decision whether to 
continue treatment  with Bydureon should be made by the clinician based on the observed HbA1c 
reduction and the achievement of the individual HbA1c goal in each patient.  Warnings and 
recommendations on the risk of lack of efficacy due to anti-drug antibodies have been included in the 
SmPC, which  is considered sufficient. 
There is a lack of data on the persistence of the effect beyond 24 weeks, since the open -label extension 
of the study did not include a placebo-treated control. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited to  59 subjects treated with  EQW in the  24 Week controlled assessment 
period and 72 subjects treated with  EQW in the extension period (EQW group and placebo → EQW 
group).  
Exenatide prolonged release was generally well-tolerated in adolescents with  T2DM. Safety findings in this 
study were consistent  with the  known safety profile of the drug in the  adult population. In the controlled 
assessment period, the overall incidence of AEs was lower in the EQW group vs placebo (61% vs 74%). 
The incidence of SAEs was also low, with in  total 7 events reported for the  entire study  period. In the 
controlled assessment period, 2 subjects (3.4%)  in the EQW group reported a SAE compared to 3 
subjects (4.3%) in  the placebo treated group. In the  extension period, a total  of 4  SAEs w ere reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644257/2022 
Page 67/71 
 
 
 
 
None of the SAEs were considered related to treatment  by the Investigator. In the controlled assessment 
period, the  reporting of treatment related AEs was slightly  higher in  the EQW group (15 subjects; 25.4%) 
compared to the placebo group (5 subjects; 21.7%).  No deaths were reported in the study. 
The most common AEs reported in the EQW group were upper respiratory tract infection (10.2%) 
whereas abdominal pain was the  most common AEs reported in the  placebo group (13.0%).  Most  AEs 
were mild or moderate in intensity.  The incidence of GI -related AEs was comparable between the EQW 
and placebo groups (22.0% and 26.1%)  during the controlled assessment period . The most frequent 
gastrointestinal disorder-related AEs were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain. These 
events were more frequently reported in the EQW group. 
There were no major hypoglycaemic events reported during the study. The occurrence of any 
hypoglycaemic event was somewhat higher in  the EQW group (8 subjects; 13. 6%) than  in the placebo 
group (1 subject; 4.3%),  out of which one minor hypoglycaemia was reported in each of the study 
groups.  
The proportions of patients experiencing injection site reactions was low  (8.5%) and comparable between 
the study groups. No injection site reactions were reported after Week 12. Of note, all injection -site 
reactions were reported among patients using the prefilled syringe device.  
Out of 55 patients  who were positive (n=55)  for exenatide antibodies, 6 patients  reported a potentially 
immune-related AE compared to no events reported by the  3 patients who were negative for exenatide 
antibodies. Three subjects in the placebo group reported potentially  immune -related AEs. The relationship 
between the timing  of the  development of ADA and the  development of a potentially immune-related AE 
is however inconsistent, thus  there is no clear association between the two . 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters over time and no notable differences 
between treatment groups. No patients met the  criteria for a potential  Hy’s Law case. 
Treatment with  EQW was associated with a small but notable reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 
small increase in heart rate but  here were no AEs of hypotension or tachycardia reported during the 
study. Development and growth assessed by Tanner staging was similar between study groups.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited to  59 subjects treated with  EQW in the  controlled assessment perio d and 
72 subjects treated with  EQW in the extension period (EQW group and placebo → EQW group). Thus, the 
safety data set is limited. The need for further follow-up of long-term safety in the  paediatric population 
has been discussed with the  Applicant within  this procedure, coming to the conclusion that  no changes to 
the currently approved RMP are deemed necessary as part of this  application, as there is no scientific 
rationale for anticipating  a different safety profile for long-term use in paediatric patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, although  still relatively rare in Europe, and the 
main driver is the increased prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Developing T2DM at a younger 
age is associated with  a considerably higher risk of long-term cardiovascular disease compared with those 
who develop T2DM in the  middle age. The rapid deterioration in glucose regulation in children as 
compared with  adults may contribute  to the greater risk for micro - and macrovascular complications in 
children with  T2DM as they develop into  adults. 
Treatment options are limited in  children as currently only metformin, insulin and one GLP-1RA 
(liraglutide) are approved for the use in paediatric patients. 
In study BCB114, a treatment  difference in HbA1c of -0.85%  was observed between EQW and placebo 
after 24 weeks. As opposed to what is often observed in studies with  adult patients  with T2DM,  the HbA1c 
increased in the placebo treated group during the controlled assessment period of 24 weeks. A similar 
pattern was observed in the study supporting the paediatric indication for  liraglutide QD and this  gives 
some indication  on the difficulties in treating the  pa ediatric population with  T2DM. The secondary 
endpoints, FPG and body weight,  did not reach statistical significance but were in favour of EQW and the 
proportion of patients  achieving HbA1c goals (< 6.5%,  ≤ 6.5%, and < 7.0%)  was 15 to 23 % higher in 
the EQW group vs placebo. Thus, a clinically relevant and statistically  significant effect of EQW on 
glycaemic control, as reflected by the  change in HbA1c, has been shown.

Antibodies to exenatide were observed in the majority of patients  (93.0%)  in the EQW group  at any time 
during the study, and 63%  had a high titer.  The proportion of adolescents/children with  high antibody 
titers and potential  loss of efficacy is higher than  reported in the adult  population. The mean reduction in 
HbA1c seem to  decrease with increasing antibody titres. However, no prediction can be done in  the 
individual patient.  Because no commercial test for ADA is available, the decision whether to  continue 
treatment with  Bydureon should be made by the clinician based on the observed HbA1c redu ction and the 
achievement of the individual HbA1c goal in each patient.  Warnings and recommendations on the  risk of 
lack of efficacy due to anti-drug antibodies have been included in the SmPC, which  is considered 
sufficient. 
There is a lack of data on the persistence of the effect beyond 24 weeks, since the open-label extension 
of the study did not include a placebo-treated control. 
The safety database is limited to  59 subjects treated with  EQW for 24 weeks in the  controlled assessment 
period and 72 subjects treated with  EQW in the extension period.  
Exenatide prolonged release was generally well-tolerated in adolescents with  T2DM. Safety findings in this 
study were consistent  with the  known safety profile of the drug in the  adult population. The incidence o f 
GI-related AEs was comparable between the EQW and placebo groups (22.0%  and 26.1%)  during the 
controlled assessment period. There were no major hypoglycaemic events reported during the study.   
Potentially immune-related AEs were only reported by EQW treated subjects who  were positive for 
exenatide antibodies, however, 3 subjects in the placebo group also reported potentially immune -related 
AEs. Thus, there is no clear relationship between ADAs and the development of a potentially immune -
related AEs. 
In summary, the safety profile does not  appear to differ from what is known from the  use of exenatide in 
adults. No  new safety concerns arise from the data submitted. The safety database is however limited 
and no data beyond 52 weeks is available. However, as there is no scientific rationale for anticipating a 
different safety profile for long-term use in paediatric patients,  no changes to the safety specification are 
warranted as part of this application. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Exenatide prolonged release showed a clinically relevant and statistically significant effect on metabolic 
control compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment seems to be well tolerated in 
this age group. The safety profile does not appear to differ from what is  known from the use of exenatide 
prolonged release in adults and no new safety concerns arise from the data submitted.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The benefit risk balance for Bydureon in the treatment of adolescent and children aged 10  years and 
above is considered positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted  data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to  the terms of the Marketing Authorisation,  concerning the following 
change: 
Variation  accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to  therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication  or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the treatment  of adolescents and children aged 10 years and above 
based on the results from Study BCB114 (D5551C00002);  a phase 3, double -blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized, multi-center  study to assess the safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly in adolescents 
with  type 2 diabetes, which  was initially  submitted and assessed by the  CHMP as part of the  post -
authorisation measure (PAM) P46 028.  As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2,  4.4,  4.8, 5.1  and 5.2 of the 
SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition,  the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the  contact details of the local representatives in the Package Leaflet.  Version 35.1 
of the RMP was agreed during the procedure. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted  with  the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the  Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0064/2021  and the  results of these studies are reflected in the  Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the  Package Leaflet.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Kalydeco, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
Nearly  15%  of  the  ADRs  reported  during  the  PSUR  covering  period  were  related  to  rash.  All  of  them 
were non-serious. In addition, 3 serious cases were reported from clinical studies. Also 7% of the ADRs 
reported during the PSUR covering period were related to dizziness and syncope. All of them were non-
serious. In addition, 2 serious cases of syncope were reported from clinical studies. Finally 20% of the 
ADRs  reported  during  the  PSUR  covering  period  were  related  to  headache.  One  of  them  was  serious 
requiring  hospitalization.  In  addition,  5  serious  cases  were  identified  in  clinical  studies.  To  conclude 
serious  cases  of  headache,  dizziness  and  rash  have  been  reported  during  the  PSUR  covering  period. 
However, these adverse reactions are currently described in section 4.8 of the SmPC as being mild to 
moderate in severity, none being serious and that no patients discontinued treatment because of these 
adverse reactions. Therefore, in view of available data, the PRAC considers that changes to the product 
information are warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Kalydeco the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ivacaftor is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

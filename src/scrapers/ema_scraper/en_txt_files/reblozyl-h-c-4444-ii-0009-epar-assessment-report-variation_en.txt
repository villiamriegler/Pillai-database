Reblozyl (luspatercept) is already authorised for the treatment of adult patients with anemia associated 
with transfusion-dependent (TD) β-thalassemia (as well as with Myelodysplastic syndrome). This type II 
variation is aimed at extending the approved β-thalassaemia indication to include adult patients with 
anemia associated with non-transfusion dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
β-thalassemia comprises a group of inherited disorders characterised by a reduction in the production of 
β-globin chains of hemoglobin (Hb) and a subsequent imbalance in globin chains (α:non-α ratio). All of 
the pathophysiologic features of β-thalassemias can be linked to this primary imbalance and accumulation 
of unpaired α-globin chains within the developing erythrocytes, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and 
peripheral hemolysis that lead to clinical complications including chronic anemia, primary iron overload, 
and hypercoagulable state (Musallam, 2013a; Taher, 2018a; Sleiman, 2018). Previously, individuals with 
beta thalassemia were classified as having beta thalassemia major, intermedia, and minor (decreasing 
severity). Subsequent classification has changed to the terms Transfusion dependent (TD) β-thalassemia 
or Non-Transfusion Dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia (Taher, 2017). 
NTD β-thalassemia is characterised by mild to moderate disease severity (previously classified as β-
thalassemia intermedia or HbE/β-thalassemia) resulting from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity 
for a mutant β-globin allele. The spectrum and severity of clinical morbidity varies widely in the NTD β-
thalassemia group, driven primarily by the underlying ineffective erythropoiesis. NTD β-thalassaemia do 
not depend on regular transfusion therapy for survival. They sporadically need transfusion therapy, e.g. 
with significant infection, during surgery or pregnancy or for limited periods of time with growth 
retardation in children or when the chronic anemia causes clinical morbidity such as splenomegaly, EMH 
pseudotumours and leg ulcers.

State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
This type II variation aims at broadening the approved indication in adult transfusion-dependent β-
thalassaemia to include patients with non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia. The CHMP had objected 
to the initially proposed indication “Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaemia 
associated with β-thalassaemia.”    
This would include less severely affected NTD β-Thalassaemia patients than those investigated in the 
pivotal study (such as patients with minor β-thalassaemia or mild anaemia).  
As a consequence, the indication was subsequently proposed by the MAH to read:  
Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with anaemia associated with beta- thalassaemia 
who are: 
• 
• 
transfusion-dependent 
non-transfusion dependent (haemoglobin concentration of ≤ 10 g/dL) (see section 5.1) 
As the benefit risk profile of Reblozyl in the claimed indication was considered negative at that stage, the 
MAH proposed the following restricted indication: 
Reblozyl is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anaemia (haemoglobin 
concentration of ≤ 10 g/dL) associated with non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (see section 
5.1) 
This was not supported, as the term “symptomatic” was not clearly defined and this would introduce 
additional uncertainties due to methodological limitations of this approach. Further, a reference to section 
5.1 was regarded sufficient to provide the relevant information the study/target population (including Hb 
threshold). The following wording was ultimately suggested, covering both Beta-thalassaemia indications 
and has been implemented by the MAH:  
Reblozyl is indicated in adults for the treatment of anemia associated with transfusion dependent and 
non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1)”. 
Epidemiology  
About 80 to 90 million people (~1.5 % of the global population) are carriers of β-thalassemia with 
approximately 60,000 symptomatic individuals born annually (Modell, 2007). The annual incidence of 
symptomatic individuals is estimated at 1 in 100,000 worldwide and 1 in 10,000 in the European Union 
(EU) (Galanello, 2010). Incidence is highest in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, North America 
and South East Asia (particularly India, China, Thailand and Indonesia; this region accounts for 
approximately 50% of affected births). About 40,000 children are born with TD β-thalassemia each year, 
while a smaller, ill-defined number have NTD β-thalassemia forms (Modell, 2008; Musallam, 2013a; 
Taher, 2013; Taher, 2021; Weatherall, 2010). 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Primary imbalance in globin chain production and accumulation of unpaired α-globin chains within the 
developing erythrocytes result in ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral haemolysis leading to chronic 
anaemia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 10/245 
 
 
 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Profound anaemia triggers a number of compensatory mechanisms responsible for the clinical sequelae 
associated with β-thalassemia such as erythroid marrow expansion, splenomegaly, increased intestinal 
iron absorption (leading to iron overload), leg ulcers, peripheral haemolysis, hypercoagulable state 
(Sleiman, 2018), and pulmonary hypertension (Musallam, 2013a; Rivella, 2012). In patients who do not 
receive any treatment intervention, these complications continue to accumulate with advancing age, 
leading to an adult population impacted by heavy disease burden and requiring considerable medical 
attention (Taher, 2010a). 
Management 
NTD β-thalassemia patients, unlike TD β-thalassemia patients, do not require regular RBC transfusions for 
survival. However, NTD β-thalassemia patients still need transfusion therapy intermittently when low Hb 
levels are anticipated (eg, during surgery, infection, or pregnancy) or even more frequently for limited 
periods of time (Musallam, 2021a; Cappellini, 2018). Further treatment options include iron chelation 
therapy (ICT), prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, splenectomy, and (off label) foetal haemoglobin (HbF) 
induction (such as hydroxyurea) (Taher, 2017). 
Currently available treatment options are limited, with iron-chelating agents being the only approved 
treatment, which only addresses the burden of the iron-related comorbidities. While transfusions are 
effective for treating chronic anaemia (Hb levels below 10 g/dL), they contribute to the additive effect of 
underlying iron overloading mechanisms of the disease, and as such, avoidance of lifelong transfusions is 
an important goal of therapy for these patients, especially since both intrinsic and extrinsic iron has a 
significant impact on patients’ multisystemic comorbidities.  
Other impacts to consider are the public health and individual burden for these transfusions, considering 
this specific therapy would also trigger more intense ICT. Other available treatment options, such as 
splenectomy and hydroxyurea, have varying degrees of efficacy and are associated with increased risks, 
respectively. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a novel, first in class recombinant fusion protein that binds select transforming 
growth factor-beta superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands (eg, growth 
differentiation factor-11, activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signaling, resulting in erythroid 
maturation through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. 
Smad2/3 signaling is abnormally high in disease models characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis, ie, 
MDS and β-thalassemia. In mouse models of MDS and β-thalassemia, luspatercept decreased Smad2/3 
signaling, reduced erythroid hyperplasia, enhanced erythroid maturation, increased haemoglobin, and 
increased the number of red blood cells. In mouse models of β-thalassemia, luspatercept also improved 
the quality of red blood cells, as shown by increased red blood cell (RBC) life span and reduced abnormal 
red cell morphology and haemolysis.  
Reblozyl (luspatercept) was approved by the European Commission on 25 Jun 2020 (EMEA/H/C/004444) 
in the following indications: 
• 
the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent (TD) anemia due to very low, low and 
intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts, who had an unsatisfactory 
response to or are ineligible for erythropoietin-based therapy. 
• 
the treatment of adult patients with TD anemia associated with beta (β)-thalassemia.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice was received from the CHMP on 25 June 2015 on the β-thalassemia clinical development 
plan, which included an antidrug antibody (ADA) plan, a proposed NTD β-thalassemia pivotal study design 
and the development plan for an NTDT-PRO tool that would be incorporated into the study 
(EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/2015/PA/III). Follow-up advice was received on 13 October 2016, specifically on 
changes to the NTD β-thalassemia pivotal study design, including changing the key secondary endpoint 
from LIC to the NTDT-PRO T/W domain, and updates to the NTDT-PRO development plan 
(EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/FU/1/2016/PA/II). 
The shift from a more severely affected study population comprising patients with a significant iron 
overload (not regularly transfused but at the margins of transfusion dependency) towards a broader, 
more heterogenous population with a high symptomatic burden (probably including most of the severely 
iron-overloaded patients, but extended to other symptomatic subjects) was found an acceptable 
approach, but with some caveats to be considered. In the former ‘borderline’ (nearly transfusion 
dependent in most instances) population with iron overload, the main benefit could have included easier 
and more efficient iron overload control, while for the latter ‘true independent’ population QoL 
improvement and prevention of other complications might be the main treatment goal. However, by 
introducing a selection of the study population based on QoL rather than on iron overload as previously 
planned, it would have been expected that recruitment would also be broader and the sample size to be 
increased. This was considered important, as with the more heterogeneous population all endpoints would 
need to contribute to the assessment of the clinical benefit and subgroup analyses would be crucial to 
justify that the whole population described by the sought indication is getting a benefit also beyond 
haemoglobin increase (e.g. improved quality of life).  
This advice has not been followed and the sample size not been increased. On the contrary, the eligibility 
criteria were even further widened, i.e., also asymptomatic patients were ultimately eligible to the study, 
thus further increasing the heterogeneity of the study population. 
An additional critical point of discussion in both scientific advice procedures was the development of the 
new PRO instrument NTDT (at the time including both tiredness/weakness and shortness of breath) 
within the clinical development programme for Luspatercept. The CHMP welcomed in principle the 
development of an NTDT-specific questionnaire. However, it was stated that “Causal conclusions based on 
study outcomes derived from a setting where still two objectives are to be evaluated (i.e. the treatment 
outcome on one hand and the validation of the PRO measurement tool on the other hand) will lack 
reliability. Validation should ideally be performed in a well-known and independent setting. Therefore the 
suggested approach is not supported. Keeping this in mind it should be considered that a disease specific 
PRO tool for NTD β-thalassemia developed by Celgene might in the end not be applicable during ACE-536 
development but only serve for later investigations.” (EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/2015/PA/III). The same 
concern was reiterated in the follow-up advice (EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/FU/1/2016/PA/II). Several limitations 
of the tool as proposed at this stage were highlighted (which were not specifically addressed) and the 
concern was expressed that the PRO instrument would likely have only limited value as a confirmatory 
parameter, given that the MAH was planning to validate the instrument within their phase 3 study 
programme. The MAH was also discouraged to use a responder analysis (decrease from baseline ≥ 1 in 
mean NTDT PRO) as the key secondary outcome, as the latter would, as part of the validation exercise, 
have to clearly justified as the clinically relevant difference, which seemed difficult at the state of 
evidence. Although the MAH followed the advice to use the NTDT PRO subsequently as a continuous 
outcome parameter for the key secondary endpoint, further validation of the PRO in an independent 
setting was ultimately not performed.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claimed that all of the studies in the luspatercept β-thalassemia clinical development program 
were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. All studies were closely monitored by Sponsor 
personnel or a contract organisation for compliance to all aspects of the protocol. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As a protein, luspatercept is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment under the 1 
June 2006 “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use”
(EMEA/CHMP/S/4447/00). BMS-986346 and the product excipients do not pose a significant risk to the 
environment.  
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of luspatercept. Considering the above data, luspatercept is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
The luspatercept global clinical development program for NTD β-thalassemia comprises three clinical 
efficacy studies that include a pivotal Phase 2, randomized, double-blind study in non-transfusion 
dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia patients (ACE-536-B-THAL-002; BEYOND) and two supportive, sequential 
Phase 2 open-label, single arm studies (A536-04 and its extension A536-06), which had already been 
part of the initial β-thalassemia submission and included transfusion dependent (TD) as well as NDT 
patients. Data from 48 weeks for Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 is provided. Additionally, a CSR for Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-003, an observational study used for the validation of the non-transfusion-dependent β-
thalassemia patient-reported outcome (NTDT-PRO), is also included in this submission. 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology data were collected from subjects with NTD β-thalassemia in the pivotal Phase 2 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and 2 supportive Phase 2 studies (Studies A536-04 and A536-06). 
The population PK model established previously for subjects with β-thalassemia from Studies A536-04 
and ACE-536-B-THAL-001 (Report ACE-536-MPK-001, submitted with the initial MAA) was updated by 
including subjects with NTD β-thalassemia from Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 to facilitate the comparison 
of luspatercept PK between subjects with NTD β-thalassemia and subjects with TD β-thalassemia (Report 
ACE-536-MPK-006).

Methods 
Bioanalytical Methods: 
Concentrations of luspatercept in serum were determined using a validated enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay. The lower limit of quantitation was 50 ng/mL. 
Table 3: Summary Description of Bioanalytical Assays for Luspatercept Concentration 
Updates have been performed in order to meet current guidance requirements and/or qualify new 
batches of reagents: 
Report 176680 addendum 4 (Report 188684): Validation for the Determination of ACE-536 in Human 
Serum by Quantitative ELISA 
A post-validation assessment of the method was performed in order to verify the performance of the 
assay after an optimisation (blocking buffer and diluent buffer change, curve range narrowed, sample 
incubation time modified, additional calibration point). All pre-set validation parameters were met and no 
deviations occurred. The MAH’s post-validation assessments confirms that the assay is still in a validated 
state.    
Population: 
In pharmacokinetic (PK) and exposure-response relationship analyses (see PK/PD Modelling section), 
subjects with NTD β-thalassemia were defined as subjects who had a baseline transfusion burden of 0 to 
5 RBC units/24 weeks, and subjects with TD β-thalassemia were defined as subjects who a baseline 
transfusion burden ≥ 6 RBC units/24 weeks. All subjects with NTD β-thalassemia (N = 127) in the above 
3 clinical studies participated in PK assessments.

Software: 
Datasets preparation, exploration and visualisation were performed using SAS (Version 9.3), R (version

The PPK analysis and E-R analysis for the time course of Hb were performed using NONMEM (Version 7.3 
or greater), with the firstorder conditional estimation and the INTERACTION option. Perl-Speaks-NONMEM 
(PsN, Version 4.6.0 or greater) was used during PK and Hb modeling evaluations, and the results were 
further analyzed by R and RStudio software.  
Exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety were performed using R and RStudio software. 
Population PK model 
The population PK model established previously for subjects with TD β-thalassemia from Studies A536-04 
and ACE-536-B-THAL-001 (Report ACE-536-MPK-001, submitted with the initial MAA) was updated by 
including subjects with NTD β-thalassemia from Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002.  
OBJECTIVES: 
The objectives of the analysis were to describe the concentration-time profile of luspatercept in subjects 
with non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (NTDT) or transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and 
to assess the effect of selected key covariates on luspatercept pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. 
METHODOLOGY: 
Analysis Populations: 
The population PK (PPK) analysis included subjects with NTDT or TDT in Studies A536-04, ACE-536-B-
THAL-001, and ACE-536-B-THAL-002, who received at least one dose of luspatercept and had measurable 
luspatercept serum concentrations. Studies A536-04 and ACE-536-B-THAL-001 had been included in the 
previous PPK analysis that characterized luspatercept PK mainly in subjects with TDT, and Study ACE-
536-B-THAL-002 was included to enable better characterization of luspatercept PK in subjects with NTDT 
relative to those with TDT. Luspatercept concentration data from Study A536-06 were not included in PPK 
analysis, because all subjects in this study had already provided sufficient PK samples in Study A536-04. 
The PPK analysis dataset included 4636 PK samples from 383 subjects. The included 4636 samples were 
collected from 5 to 919 days after the first dose.  
Categorical and continuous demographic characteristics of subjects included in the PPK analysis are 
presented in the tables below.

Analysis: 
The luspatercept PPK model was developed in three steps: base, full and final models. A previously 
developed PPK model was updated with additional 96 subjects with NTDT from Study ACE-536-BTHAL-
002 and used as a base model for the full model development. The full model was developed by 
incorporating additional covariates of interest into the base model. The final model was a parsimonious 
model derived from the full model. The final model was validated using goodness of fit, bootstrap 
resampling and visual predictive check (VPC). 
Empirical Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters were generated using the final PPK model. 
Measures of luspatercept serum exposure were computed for each subject including: 
-  Maximum concentration after a single dose (Cmax) and at steady state (Cmax,ss). 
-  Area under concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady state (AUCss). 
-  Average AUC from Week 1 to 15 (AUCavg15), Week 1 to 24 (AUCavg24), and Week 1 to 48 
(AUCavg48), which were used as the exposure endpoints for exposure-efficacy analyses during a 
given evaluation period (see section PK/PD modelling).  
-  AUC at the first event (AUCevent), which was used as the exposure endpoint for exposure-safety 
analyses. (see section PK/PD modelling) 
-  Average concentration at steady state (AUCavg.ss), calculated as [AUCss/21 days].  
Luspatercept PK parameters were summarised for groups of interest (renal function, race, and 
transfusion dependence) and for Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
Dataset: 
A total of 4,636 luspatercept serum concentration records from 381 subjects, including 96 new subjects 
with NTDT from Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, were included in this updated PPK analysis.  
Base model: 
The previously developed model, a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, 
provided a good fit to the observed data including newly added subjects with NTDT from Study ACE-536-
B-THAL-002. The base model was stable (condition number of 80.78 was well below 1000), and the 
parameter estimates were generally consistent with the estimates from the previous model. All retained 
covariates remained statistically significant with the 95% CI of the covariate effect parameter excluding 
the null value, but the effect of baseline RBC transfusion burden became smaller compared with the 
previous model. The goodness-of-fit plots for the base model indicated that the observed concentrations 
of both subjects with NTDT and subjects with TDT were well described by the model predictions. 
The parameter estimates in the base model were generally consistent with the estimates from the 
previous model. 
Covariate analysis: 
The relationships between potential covariates and empirical Bayesian estimates of random effects from 
the base model for CL/F and V1/F were examined. A positive trend between individual eGFR and random 
effect of CL/F was observed. High collinearity (Pearson correlation efficient > 0.5) among potential 
covariates examined was not observed. Effect of ADA was not tested in the covariate analysis as there 
were less than 10 ADA-positive subjects observed. 
Univariate analysis was conducted to select potential new covariates. The following potential new 
covariates were selected for the full model due to a reduction in BIC in univariate analyses:

- On CL/F: Age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), individual eGFR, and total bilirubin 
- On V1/F: Age 
Addition of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), race, splenectomy, and β-thalassemia gene mutation on 
CL/F, or addition of albumin, total bilirubin, race, splenectomy, and β-thalassemia gene mutation on V1/F 
increased BIC compared with the base model in univariate analyses, and thus these factors were not 
included in the full model. 
The full model was derived by simultaneously incorporating all potential covariate-parameter relationships 
of interest into the model, including the covariates identified for the previous model and potential new 
covariates selected from univariate analyses. 
Full model:  
The full covariate model for CL/F and V1/F were as follows: 
Where CL/Fi is individual CL/F; CLTV is typical value of CL/F for a reference subject; CLWT, CLTRANSBR, CLALB, 
CLAGE, CLAST, CLIND_EGFR, and CLTBIL are typical values of covariate effects on CL/F for baseline body weight, 
RBC transfusion burden, albumin, age, AST, individual eGFR, and total bilirubin, respectively; V1/Fi is 
individual V1/F; V1TV is typical value of V1/F for a reference subject; V1WT, V1TRANSBR, and V1AGE, are 
typical values of covariate effects on V1/F for baseline body weight, RBC transfusion burden and age, 
respectively; WTi, TRANSBRi, ALBi, AGEi, ASTi, IND_EGFRi, and TBILi are individual baseline values for 
body weight (kg), RBC transfusion burden (units/24 weeks), albumin (g/L), age (years), AST (U/L), 
individual eGFR (mL/min), and total bilirubin (μmol/L), respectively; ηCLi is the difference between the 
CL/F estimate based on typical values and individual CL/F estimate; ηV1i is the difference between the 
V1/F estimate based on typical values and individual V1/F estimate. The reference subject for the above 
full covariate models was a subject with body weight of 70 kg, RBC transfusion burden of 14 units/24 
weeks, albumin of 46 g/L, age of 32 years, AST of 22 U/L, individual eGFR of 120 mL/min, and total 
bilirubin of 33 μmol/L at baseline. (ie, at the same reference values used for the previous covariate 
analysis and previous full model). 
In the full model, the effect of body weight, albumin, individual eGFR and total bilirubin on CL/F as well as 
the effect of body weight and baseline RBC transfusion burden on V1/F were statistically significant. 
However, only the effect of body weight on CL/F and V1/F may be clinically relevant (exceeding the 
conventionally accepted limits of 80% to 125% of the reference value). Effects of other significant 
covariates remained within ± 25% of the reference value.

Final model: 
The final PPK model was derived from the full model by retaining statistically significant covariates, 
including body weight, albumin, and individual eGFR on CL/F and body weight and baseline RBC 
transfusion burden on V1/F.  
Evaluation of the final PPK model with the goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks 
demonstrated robust predictive performance. The model was validated to be appropriate for its use in 
predicting luspatercept exposure for E-R analyses. 
The final model adequately described individual luspatercept serum concentration profiles for subjects 
with either NTDT or TDT.

Model Evaluation 
Population and individual predicted concentrations of luspatercept from the final model suggest good 
agreement with the observed data for both subjects with NTDT and subjects with TDT.  
The final PPK model of luspatercept was also evaluated using VPC with 500 simulations. For each study, 
the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of the observed concentration data at each time point from the 
previous dose or from the first dose were generally contained within the respective 95% CI of the 
simulated data. There was a good agreement in the time course and central tendency between 
distributions of observed and simulated data, with no obvious bias. The VPC also suggested that the final 
model improved the fits for the observed median and 5th percentile concentrations compared with the 
base model.

Results 
Luspatercept serum concentration-time profiles for subjects with NTDT or TDT were adequately described 
by a one-compartment PPK model with the first order absorption and elimination. The typical values of 
CL/F and V1/F of luspatercept were 0.525 L/day and 8.35 L, respectively. The typical value of elimination 
half-life of luspatercept was 11 days.

Summary of empirical Bayesian estimation of individual luspatercept PK parameters showed a 27% to 
41% higher mean AUCss in subjects with mild to moderate renal function than in subjects with normal 
renal function. Mean luspatercept AUCss was similar between races (Asian versus White) or between 
NTDT and TDT. 
Body weight was the most influential covariate for both CL/F and V1/F, while other statistically significant 
covariates had limited effects (albumin, individual eGFR and total bilirubin on CL/F; baseline RBC 
transfusion burden on V1/F).  
The analysis reconfirmed that age (18 to 71 years), sex, race (White, Asian, and other), splenectomy, β-
thalassemia gene mutation (β0/β0 versus non-β0/β0), and liver enzyme levels (up to 3 times of the 
upper limit of normal range) had no significant effects on luspatercept PK.  
Luspatercept PK was similar between subjects with NTDT and those with TDT. 
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, luspatercept serum concentrations were at steady state on Day 63, and 
mean AUCss for the starting dose of 1 mg/kg was 36% or 41% higher in subjects who achieved ≥ 1 g/dL 
or 1.5 g/dL increase from baseline in mean Hb value during Week 13 to 24 (primary efficacy endpoint) 
than those who did not.

Summary of Pharmacokinetic Data for Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
A total of 96 subjects were included in the analysis. Luspatercept concentration data collected from Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002 were combined with the data collected from previous studies (A536-04 and ACE-
536-B-THAL-001) and analysed using the population PK method.  
The mean (SD) of observed luspatercept serum concentrations on a dosing day are displayed below 
stratified by dose modification category during Week 1 to Week 48:  
1. 
2. 
In subjects with no dose modification, the mean concentration values were mostly flat from Day 
63 through Day 315.  
In subjects with at least one dose escalation (without dose reduction/delay), the mean 
concentration value was lowest after the first dose (Day 21) and it increased with time.  
Assessment report

3. 
In subjects with least 1 dose reduction and/or delay, the mean concentration values were highest 
after the first dose (Day 21) and increased later in treatment (Day 231 to Day 315), possibly 
resulting from dose increases in some subjects during this period.  
4. 
At Day 315 by which time most subjects had completed dose escalation, mean luspatercept 
serum concentration values were comparable among the 3 dose modification categories. 
Figure 5: Mean (SD) Luspatercept Serum Concentrations on A Dosing Day by Dose Modification 
Category in Week 1 to Week 48 (ACE-536-B-THAL-002)
Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the final PPK model are summarised by responder status. The 
model-predicted median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was approximately 5.5 days and the estimated 
mean t½ in serum was 11.8 days.  
The overall individual variability in AUC at steady state (AUCss) for the starting dose of 1 mg/kg was 
moderate (34.4%). Mean AUCss for the starting dose was 36% higher in subjects who achieved ≥ 1 g/dL 
increase from baseline in mean Hb value during Week 13 to 24 (primary efficacy endpoint) than those 
who did not. Compared to the non-responders, a 41% increase in mean AUCss was also observed in 
subjects who achieved ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase from baseline in mean Hb value during Week 13 to 24.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Luspatercept (ACE-536) is a novel, first in class recombinant fusion protein that binds select transforming 
growth factor-beta superfamily ligands. By binding to specific endogenous ligands (e.g. growth 
differentiation factor-11, activin B) luspatercept inhibits Smad2/3 signaling, resulting in erythroid 
maturation through differentiation of late-stage erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the bone marrow. 
Smad2/3 signaling is abnormally high in disease models characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, ie, 
MDS and β-thalassemia. 
In mouse models of MDS and β-thalassemia, luspatercept decreased Smad2/3 signaling, reduced 
erythroid hyperplasia, enhanced erythroid maturation, increased haemoglobin, and increased the number 
of red blood cells. In mouse models of β-thalassemia, luspatercept also improved the quality of red blood 
cells, as shown by increased red blood cell (RBC) life span and reduced abnormal red cell morphology and 
haemolysis.

Figure 6: Luspatercept Mechanism of Action 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Individual exposure measures predicted from the population PK model were used in the exposure-
response analysis to measure effectiveness (erythroid responses) and toxicities. In addition, serum drug 
concentrations were assessed to assist in the interpretation of the results of ADA tests. 
The Hb-time profiles in response to luspatercept dose levels 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg administered Q3W to 
subjects with NTD β-thalassemia were adequately described by an indirect response model with zero-
order rate Hb input into blood (Kin) and first-order rate constant of Hb loss in blood (Kout). The model 
associated luspatercept serum concentration with its stimulatory effect on Hb input into blood. The typical 
values of maximum estimable effect (Emax) and the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 
luspatercept were 0.4253 and 7.6 μg/mL, respectively. 
This led to a mean 19.1% increase in Hb input into blood at the 1 mg/kg starting dose. Estimates of the 
system parameters (Kin and Kout) suggested a shorter Hb lifespan (14 days) and fast Hb input rate, 
consistent with accelerated RBC destruction and compensatory erythroid marrow expansion in subjects 
with NTD β-thalassemia. 
Haematology mean values over time (ACE-536-B-THAL-002) 
At baseline, the serum EPO level in both treatment groups was similar (median: 65.20 and 65.29 IU/L in the 
luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively). A plot of mean serum EPO values over time was 
provided.

Figure 7: Mean and SE for Change in Serum Erythropoietin Over Time 
At baseline, the median reticulocyte count was 137.30 x 109/L in the luspatercept treatment group and 
136.10 x 109/L in the placebo treatment group. A plot of mean reticulocyte values over time was 
provided. An increase in mean reticulocyte counts from baseline in the luspatercept treatment group 
reflects increased bone marrow erythropoietic activity which would be consistent with the expected 
therapeutic effect for this drug. 
Figure 8: Mean and SE of Reticulocyte (Blood) Over Time 
At baseline, the mean (median) nucleated RBCs were lower in the luspatercept treatment group than in 
the placebo treatment group (16.26 [0.32] versus 25.89 [8.19], respectively). Changes over time in 
nucleated RBCs indicated decreases of smaller magnitude in the luspatercept treatment group than in the 
placebo treatment group. No corresponding figure was provided. 
Baseline mean (median) values for leukocytes were lower in the luspatercept treatment group (8.86 x 
109/L [8.03 x 109/L]) than in the placebo treatment group (10.81 x 109/L [9.07 x 109/L]), and changes 
over time indicated minimal changes in both treatment groups.

Figure 9: Mean and SE in Selected Laboratory Values Over Time 
At baseline, the mean (median) platelet count was lower in the luspatercept treatment group than in the 
placebo treatment group (341.12 [213.00] x 109/L versus 440.37 [470.00] x 109/L, respectively). In the 
luspatercept treatment group, the platelet count increased at all time points through Dose 29 Day 1. 
Subsequent time points after Dose 29 Day 1 through Dose 40 Day 1 showed in general minimal 
fluctuations from baseline in the platelet values. In the placebo treatment group, fluctuations from 
baseline in the platelet counts compared with the baseline value were generally observed from Dose 2 
Day 1 through Dose 29 Day 1. These were generally transient with no clinical consequences. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Integrated analyses based on data pooled from subjects with NTD β-thalassemia in Studies A536-04, 
A536-06 and ACE-536-BTHAL-002 were conducted to evaluate the exposure-response relationship for Hb 
versus time profiles, efficacy and safety. Exposure-response analyses for efficacy, NTDT-PRO T/W score 
and safety were also conducted specifically for the pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002.

Methods 
Analysis Populations 
The exposure-response analysis for the time course of Hb included subjects with NTDT in Studies A536-
04, A536-06, and ACE-536-B-THAL-002, who received at least one dose of luspatercept and had both 
empirical Bayesian estimates of individual luspatercept PK parameters and Hb data.  
The exposure-response analysis for safety included subjects from all three studies but the exposure-
response analysis for efficacy included only subjects from studies A536-04 and ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
Subjects with treatment interruption (≥ 84 ± 7 days) between the last dose in study A536-04 and the 
first dose in study A536-06 were treated as two separate subjects in the analysis. Placebo subjects with 
NTDT were excluded from the analysis but included in the graphical data comparisons as appropriate. 
Only Hb records in the absence of RBC transfusion (> 21 days following a transfusion event) were 
included in the analysis.

Please refer to the methods in the PK section above. 
Exposure-response Analysis for the Time Course of Hemoglobin 
A sequential approach was used in development a model to describe the Hb versus time profiles under 
luspatercept therapy. Subject-specific luspatercept serum concentrations at the time of Hb data collection 
were predicted by empirical Bayesian estimates of individual luspatercept PK parameters from the final 
PPK model and used as the inputs into the Hb model. The Hb model was developed in three steps: base, 
full, and final models. The final model was validated using goodness of fit, bootstrap resampling, and 
VPC. 
A total of 3715 Hb records from 143 subjects with NTDT were included in this analysis. An empirical 
indirect response model best described the time course of Hb in response to luspatercept treatment.

Exposure-response Analysis for Efficacy 
For E-R analyses of categorical efficacy endpoints, ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to 
describe the relationship between luspatercept exposures and the probability of achieving a response 
after accounting for statistically significant covariate effects.  
Development of the model included the following three stages: 
•  First, a base model was developed to assess the relationship between luspatercept exposure and 
the probability of achieving an efficacy endpoint. Linear and saturable E-R relationship was 
explored. The base model was compared with a null model without the E-R relationship. Model 
discriminatory performance was assessed using BIC criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 41/245 
 
 
 
 
•  Next, the impact of other covariates in addition to the luspatercept E-R relationship was 
examined by adding the potential covariates in univariate fashion to the base model. A full 
model was then estimated including all potential covariates identified based on a reduction in 
BIC in the univariate search. 
•  The final model was derived from the full model by dropping statistically insignificant factors 
(95% CI of odds ratio included the null value). The exposure parameter was retained in the final 
model regardless of its statistical significance, and its clinical relevance interpreted as 
appropriate. 
Time-averaged AUC (AUCavg15, AUCavg24 or AUCavg48) during an evaluation period was used as the 
primary exposure measure. For each efficacy endpoint, the exposure measure was selected based on the 
duration of the evaluation period. The exposure measure was assigned a value of zero for subjects 
receiving placebo. 
Efficacy endpoints included: 
•  Proportion of subjects achieving an increase from baseline ≥ 1.0 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL in mean Hb 
values in the absence of transfusions, during the following evaluation periods: 
o  Week 1 to 15 (Study A536-04 and ACE-536-B-THAL-002). 
o  Week 13 to 24 and Week 37 to 48 (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 only). 
o  During any consecutive 24-week interval (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 only).  
•  The longest duration of mean Hb increase from baseline ≥ 1.0 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL during any 
consecutive 12-week interval in the absence of transfusion (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, 
responders only) 
•  Dose level (in mg/kg) during the first response event for ≥ 1 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL increase from 
baseline in mean Hb value during any consecutive 12-week interval in the absence of 
transfusion (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, responders only). 
The ordinal logistic regression considered three categories of response: 1) No response, 2) ≥ 1.0 g/dL and 
< 1.5 g/dL Hb increase, or 3) ≥ 1.5 g/dL Hb increase. For the duration of response endpoints (mean Hb 
increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL in any consecutive 12-week interval), E-R relationship were evaluated 
by Kaplan-Meier analyses stratified by luspatercept exposure quartile, and Cox proportional hazards 
regression analyses. 
The cumulative probability (P) of the outcome (Y) being less than or equal to a specific category (j) as a 
function of the drug exposure and other covariates was described as follows: 
The β1,…., βn characterized the dependence of the Ln(odds) on one or more covariates, X1…, Xn. The coefficients, α, 
indicated cut points where the latent variable was cut to identify the three categories for each outcome. 
Covariate predictors were also evaluated.  
The dose level at first response event, defined as an increase from baseline ≥ 1.0 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL in 
mean Hb value during any consecutive 12-week interval in the absence of transfusions was also 
evaluated graphically in responders from study ACE-536-BTHAL-002.

The following factors were explored as potential covariates of the efficacy endpoints: 
•  Demographic factors: age, weight, sex, and race (Asian, non-Asian). 
•  Organ function: renal function category, baseline total bilirubin, and baseline AST. 
•  Transfusion burden at baseline (continuous, or categorical as 0, ≥ 1 units/12- or 24-weeks). 
•  Baseline Hb (continuous, or categorical as < 8.5 g/dL, ≥ 8.5 g/dL). 
•  Splenectomy, β-thalassemia gene mutation (β0/β0 and non-β0/β0). 
•  Baseline EPO (< 200 U/L, ≥ 200 U/L). 
•  β-Thalassemia diagnosis (β-thalassemia, Hb E/ β-thalassemia, β-thalassemia combined with α-
thalassemia). 
Continuous covariates were not centred in ordinal logistic regression analysis, but they were centred at 
their respective median values in Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. 
The results of the exposure-efficacy analysis were presented graphically by overlaying the observed 
response rate and its 95% CI within each exposure group with the model-predicted mean probability and 
its 95% CI (stratified by significant covariates as appropriate). In the reported model parameter tables, 
the p-values for model parameters were determined based on chi-squared tests versus the reduced 
model; hence, p-values were not provided for the intercept terms of the ordinal logistic regressions. 
The E-R relationships for duration of Hb response (≥ 1.0 g/dL and ≥ 1.5 g/dL evaluated separately) were 
explored by Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots stratified by luspatercept serum exposure quantile groups. Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis were conducted to adjust for significant covariates to ascertain if 
luspatercept exposure was a predictor for duration of response. 
The dose level at the first response event (≥ 1.0 g/dL and ≥ 1.5 g/dL evaluated separately) were 
evaluated graphically and summarised numerically. The distribution of luspatercept exposure and other 
covariates that might impact efficacy and dose escalation were summarized by the highest dose 
administered in the primary treatment phase of Week 1 to 48. 
Exposure-response Analysis for Safety 
The E-R relationships between safety endpoints and luspatercept AUC at the time of the first AE 
(AUCevent) were explored over two evaluation periods, Weeks 1 to 6 (during which no intra-subject dose 
escalation was permitted) and Weeks 1 to 48 (during which intra-subject dose escalation was permitted). 
For the Week 1 to 6 period, logistic regression analyses were conducted, including evaluation of potential 
covariate predictors. These analyses were repeated for the Week 1 to 48 evaluation periods. Additionally, 
the influence of luspatercept AUCevent on the time to the first event of the specified safety endpoint during 
Week 1 to 48 was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analyses stratified by luspatercept exposure quartile, and 
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. 
The model development stages were similar to those described for the E-R analysis for efficacy. If a 
subject had multiple TEAEs of the same type (e.g., serious TEAEs) during the evaluation period, only the 
earliest event was counted as an event in the logistic regression analysis. 
Area under the concentration-time curve at the time of event was used as the primary exposure measure 
in exposure-safety analysis. The exposure measure was assigned a value of zero for subjects receiving 
placebo.

Safety endpoints included: 
•  Proportion of subjects experiencing the following TEAEs: 
o  Serious TEAEs 
o  TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 
o  Fatigue-like events ≥ Grade 1 
o  Bone pain-like events ≥ Grade 1 
o  Dizziness ≥ Grade 1 
o  Hypertension ≥ Grade 1 
o  Myalgia ≥ Grade 1 
o  TEAEs leading to dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinuation (Study ACE-536-
B-THAL-002 only) 
•  Proportion of subjects experiencing the following Hb events: 
o  Pre-dose Hb increase from baseline ≥ 2.0 g/dL/3 weeks leading to dose reduction (Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002 only) 
o  Pre-dose Hb ≥ 11.5 g/dL leading to dose delay (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 only) 
Preferred terms (MedDRA version 23.0) included “Asthenia” and “Fatigue” for fatigue-like events and 
included “Bone pain” and “Arthralgia” for bone pain-like events. 
Model Development 
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to develop models describing the relationship between 
luspatercept serum exposure and the probability of experiencing TEAEs after adjusting for the effect of 
other significant covariates, if any. 
The probability that the event occurs as a function of the drug exposure and other covariates is described 
as follows: 
where Pi was the probability of the event in the ith subject and α was the baseline Ln(odds) of the event. The β1,…., 
βn characterized the dependence of the Ln(odds) on one or more covariates, X1…, Xn. 
The following factors were explored as potential covariates to influence the safety endpoints: 
•  Demographic factors: age, weight, sex, and race (White, Asian, others). 
•  Organ function: renal function category, baseline total bilirubin, and baseline AST. 
•  Transfusion burden at baseline (continuous, or as categorical with ranges to be determined). 
•  Baseline Hb (continuous, or categorical as < 8.5 g/dL and ≥ 8.5 g/dL). 
•  Splenectomy, β-thalassemia gene mutation (β0/β0 and non-β0/β0). 
•  Baseline EPO (< 200 U/L, ≥ 200 U/L). 
•  β-Thalassemia diagnosis (β-thalassemia, Hb E/ β-thalassemia, β-thalassemia combined with α-
thalassemia)

Continuous covariates were centred at their respective median values in both logistic regression analysis 
and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. 
The results of the exposure-safety analysis for the binary endpoints were presented graphically by 
overlaying the observed frequency and its 95% CI within each exposure group with the model-predicted 
mean probability and its 95% CI (stratified by significant covariates as appropriate). 
For the Week 1 to 48 evaluation period, relationships between the time to the first safety event and 
luspatercept exposures were explored by KM plots stratified by luspatercept serum exposure quartile 
groups. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were also conducted. If luspatercept exposure was a 
predictor of time to the first event for the specified safety endpoint, additional Cox proportional hazards 
regression analyses were conducted to adjust for significant covariate predictors. 
Analysis of Relationship between Haemoglobin Increase and Tiredness/Weakness 
Improvements 
The T/W domain is part of the NTDT-PRO instrument that was used to assess the severity of anaemia-
related symptoms associated with NTDT. The T/W domain included four items that assessed tiredness 
with and without physical activity and weakness with and without physical activity using a numerical 
rating scale ranging from 0 (no) to 10 (extreme). Daily scores of all four items under the NTDT-PRO T/W 
domain were averaged over 7 days and reported as the weekly T/W domain score. 
Population 
Subjects were included who received at least one dose of the study drug (luspatercept or placebo) and 
had at least one pair of the interval-matched ΔHb and ΔT/W records in the specified evaluation periods of 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 were included in the analysis. Individual Hb records and weekly T/W records 
collected within 3 weeks following a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion event were excluded from the 
analysis.

Incremental Change Analysis (Week 1 to 48): 
The average of weekly ΔT/W values during consecutive 6-week intervals (eg, Weeks 1 to 6, Weeks 7 to 
12, Weeks 13 to 18, etc.) was paired with average of ΔHb values during the same 6-week interval for 
each subject. The average ΔHb value for each 6-week interval was rounded to the nearest integer. Mean 
and standard deviation (SD) of average ΔT/W were calculated for each ΔHb level, stratified by treatment 
(luspatercept versus placebo) and baseline T/W domain score (< 3 versus ≥ 3) at randomization. The 
mean ΔT/W for each ΔHb level was graphically examined and compared with that in the absence of Hb 
change (ie, ΔHb = 0) using two-sided pairwise t-test with the p-value adjusted by Bonferroni correction 
method. The above analyses were repeated for two individual items under the NTDT-PRO T/W domain: 
tiredness with physical activity and weakness with physical activity. 
Linear Mixed-Effects Modeling (Double-blind Treatment Period): 
Weekly ΔT/W values were paired with corresponding Hb values from the same week during the Double-
blind Treatment Period (DBTP). The relationships between ΔHb, ΔT/W, and other contributing factors 
were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Sources of variability were explored systematically, 
and a formal covariate analysis was performed. At all stages of the model development, model adequacy 
was assessed based on prior knowledge of luspatercept biology, diagnostic plots, and statistical 
estimators of goodness of fit. The performance of the final model was also evaluated using visual 
predictive check. 
Software 
Derived analysis datasets were constructed using R® Version 4.0.2. Graphical analysis, model 
diagnostics, and statistical summaries were performed using R®. Linear mixed-effects modeling and 
simulation were performed using the nonlinear mixed-effects (nlme) package (Version 3.1-152) in R®. 
Pair-wise t-test and analysis of covariance were performed using the rstatix package (Version 0.7.0) in 
R®. 
Analysis 
Base Model 
In the absence of strong evidence of a nonlinear relationship, a linear mixed-effects model, with ΔT/W as 
the dependent variable and ΔHb as the independent variable, was considered a reasonable starting point. 
Effects of baseline T/W domain score, treatment and time were investigated during base model 
development. 
Covariate Analysis 
According to mechanistic plausibility and clinical interest, the following factors were considered as 
potential covariates influencing the intercept term and the slope of the ΔHb-ΔT/W relationship: 
•  Demographics: age, sex, and race (Asian, White, and Other). 
•  Region (North American and Europe, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific) 
•  Baseline disease characteristics: 
o  β-Thalassemia diagnosis (β-thalassemia, β- combined with α-thalassemia, and Hb-E/β-
thalassemia) 
o  Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level (< 200 and ≥ 200 IU/L) 
o  RBC transfusion burden (no transfusion and ≥ 1 RBC unit/24 week) 
o  Absence versus presence of splenectomy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 46/245 
 
 
 
o  Liver iron concentration (< 3, ≥ 3 to ≤ 7, and > 7 mg/g dry weight) 
o  Total bilirubin level (as a continuous variable) 
o  Renal function (normal and mild impairment) 
•  Hb level at baseline (as a continuous variable) 
•  Hb level during treatment (as a continuous variable, varying with time-matched ΔHb-ΔT/W 
pairs) 
•  Selected TEAEs (no event and at least one event, varying with time-matched ΔHb-ΔT/W pairs): 
o  Bone pain and/or arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 
o  Asthenia and/or fatigue ≥ Grade 1 
o  Other TEAEs ≥ Grade 1 if appropriate 
Continuous variables were centered at their median value. Categorical variables were classified either 
based on the definition in the study protocol or to allow sufficient sample size in each category (eg, EPO, 
liver iron concentration). The missing values for a categorical variable were treated as a single category 
of “missing”. 
Final Model 
The final model was derived from the full covariate model by removing statistically insignificant variables 
(p-value > 0.05 based on likelihood-ratio test). 
The final linear mixed-effects model is described by the following equation: 
where Intercept is the typical value of ΔT/W in the absence of Hb effect for a reference subject; η1 is the random 
effect (ie, interindividual variability) associated with Intercept; Slope is the typical value of ΔHb slope quantifying the 
linear association between ΔHb and ΔT/W for a reference subject; cTWDSBL is the centered baseline T/W domain 
score, calculated as [individual baseline T/W domain score – 4.25]; Coefslp is the coefficient for the effect of cTWDSBL 
on Slope; η2 is the random effect associated with Slope (ie, interindividual variability); Coefint is the coefficient for the 
effect of cTWDSBL on Intercept; CoefBA is the coefficient for the effect of bone pain/arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 on Intercept; 
BAi is the indicator parameter for bone pain/arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 (0 = no event, 1 = at least one event); CoefTEAE is 
the coefficient for the effect of nonspecific TEAEs ≥ Grade 1 on Intercept; TEAEi is the indicator parameter for 
nonspecific TEAEs ≥ Grade 1 (0 = no event, 1 = at least one event); and ε is the residual error (unexplained 
variability). The reference subject for the final model was a subject with a median baseline T/W domain score of 4.25

Model Evaluation 
At all stages of the model development, assessment of model adequacy was based on prior knowledge of 
luspatercept biology, diagnostic plots, and statistical estimators of goodness of fit. 
For the final model, a plot of the mean and 95% CI of mean for the observed ∆T/W versus deciles or 
quintiles of observed ΔHb overlaid with the model predictions (mean and 95% CI) was generated to 
assess if the model described the observed data adequately. 
The observed data were grouped based on deciles of ΔHb for the luspatercept arm and quintiles of ΔHb 
for the placebo arm to allow a similar number of observations in each ΔHb group across luspatercept and 
placebo arms (approximately 2:1 observations due to approximately 2:1 enrollment).  
The model predictions were generated using a nonparametric bootstrap procedure. Three thousand 
(3000) new datasets were generated using resampling with replacement.

The final model was also evaluated by visual predictive check. The model provided a good fit to the 
observed ΔHb-ΔT/W relationship for both luspatercept and placebo arms, with the observed means for 
most ΔHb groups falling within the 95% CI for model-predicted mean. A ΔHb-dependent reduction in T/W 
domain score was evident for both observed and predicted data at a baseline T/W domain score ≥ 3 in 
subjects treated with luspatercept.

Results 
Exposure-response Analysis for the Time Course of Haemoglobin 
Haemoglobin concentration-time data from luspatercept doses of 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg administered 
subcutaneously Q3W to subjects with NTDT were best described by an empirical indirect response model 
with zero-order Hb inputs into blood and first-order Hb loss from blood. The model associated 
luspatercept serum concentration with its stimulatory effect on Hb input into blood. 
Overall, the final model adequately described individual time course of Hb for up to 919 days. Evaluation 
of the final Hb model with the goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks demonstrated robust 
predictive performance.  
The model is useful for predicting the onset, magnitude, and duration characteristics of Hb response at 
various luspatercept dosing regimens. 
The drug effect parameters (Emax and EC50) were estimated with good precision and pharmacologically 
plausible. The typical value of luspatercept Emax was 0.4253, which would increase Hb input by a 
maximum of 42.5%. The IIV on Emax was 38.9% but no covariates were identified for Emax (tested 
covariates: age, weight, AST, EPO, total bilirubin, sex, race, renal function, β-thalassemia diagnosis, β-
thalassemia gene mutation, splenectomy, and baseline RBC transfusion burden). It is possible that the 
factors affecting Emax had been largely accounted for by using subject-specific PK parameters and 
baseline Hb values. The typical value of luspatercept EC50 was 7.6 μg/mL, close to the Cmax.ss value 
(8.36 μg/mL) observed in subjects with NTDT and treated at the 1 mg/kg dose in Study ACE-536-B-
Assessment report

THAL-002. Covariates could not be assessed for EC50, because the data did not contain sufficient 
information to allow modeling individual variability for this parameter.  
The average luspatercept serum concentration at steady state was estimated to be 6.19 μg/mL for the 1 
mg/kg dose and 7.74 μg/mL for the 1.25 mg/kg dose, which are predicted to increase Hb input into blood 
by 19.1% and 21.4%, respectively. A similar percent increase (18.9%, from 8.2 to 9.75 g/dL) in mean 
Hb from baseline was observed in the luspatercept arm during Week 13 to 24 when most subjects were 
treated at 1 to 1.25 mg/kg (Report ACE-536-B-THAL-002, Table 22). It is recognised that the estimated 
Emax and EC50 values from the final model should not be extrapolated outside the luspatercept dose 
levels (0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg) used to derive these parameters. 
The system parameters (Kout) were also estimated with good precision and physiologically reasonable. 
The Kout value of 0.07027 from the final model suggested an RBC (thus Hb in RBCs) lifespan of 14 days 
in subjects with NTDT, which was consistent with the estimated values for patients with thalassemia 
(Erlandson, 1958; Singer, 2004; Sitarz, 1963), whose RBCs are known to have shorter lifespans (11 to 
43 days) than those of normal adults (120 days). The Kin for a subject with a baseline Hb of 8.5 g/dL was 
estimated to be approximately 0.6 g/dL/day, 5.6 times the theoretical normal rate (0.108 g/dL/day, 
assuming Hb = 13 g/dL and RBC lifespan = 120 days for a healthy adult), consistent with increased Hb 
production rate in patients with thalassemia (1.5 to 5.4 times the normal rate) (Erlandson, 1958).  
The shorter Hb lifespan and increased Hb input rate are reflective of the accelerated RBC destruction due 
to peripheral hemolysis/ splenomegaly and compensatory erythroid marrow expansion in subjects with 
NTDT (Rivella, 2012).

maximum stimulatory effect on Hb input rate, Emax = maximum stimulatory effect of drug on Hb input rate; Kout = 
first-order rate constant of Hb loss in blood; RSE = relative standard error. a Nonparametric 95% confidence interval 
obtained from 1000 bootstrap runs with 1000 runs minimized successfully. Individual variability shrinkage was 15.8% 
for baseline Hb, 21.6% for Emax, and 8.3% for additive residual error. Condition number was 97.69. 
CONCLUSIONS: E-R analysis for the time course of Hb (NTDT only) 
The time course of Hb in response to luspatercept dose levels 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg administered Q3W to 
subjects with NTDT was adequately described by an empirical indirect response model with zero-order Hb 
input into blood and first order Hb loss from blood. The model associated luspatercept serum 
concentration with its stimulatory effect on Hb input into blood.

The typical values of Emax and EC50 of luspatercept were 0.4253 and 7.6 μg/mL, respectively. This led 
to a mean 19.1% increase in Hb input into blood at the 1 mg/kg starting dose. No significant covariates 
were identified for luspatercept Emax.  
Estimates of the system parameters (Kin and Kout) suggested a shorter Hb lifespan (14 days) and fast 
Hb input rate, consistent with accelerated RBC destruction and compensatory erythroid marrow 
expansion in subjects with NTDT. 
Exposure-response Analysis for Efficacy 
The relationship between luspatercept serum exposure and Hb-related efficacy endpoints was evaluated 
for subjects with NTDT (N = 127) over the dose range of 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg during the first 15 weeks of 
treatment in an integrated analysis with data pooled from Studies A536-04 and ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
The exposure-efficacy relationship was also evaluated specifically for Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 over 
the dose range of 0.6 to 1.25 mg/kg during early (Week 13 to 24), late (Week 37 to 48), and any 
consecutive 12-week or 24-week evaluation periods (N=96). An exposure-dependent increase in Hb 
response was consistently observed regardless of the analysis population or evaluation period. 
The results from ordinal logistic regression and time-to-event analyses demonstrated that the frequency, 
and magnitude of Hb increase in the absence of transfusion were positively correlated with luspatercept 
serum exposure in subjects with NTDT. In addition, luspatercept exposure was associated with longer 
duration of mean Hb increase from baseline ≥ 1 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL in any consecutive 12-week interval. 
The odds of achieving at least 1 g/dL Hb increase from baseline was 43% to 147% higher for every 20-
unit increase in the time averaged AUC depending on the evaluation period. The risk of losing the Hb 
response was approximately 22% lower for every 20-unit increase in the time averaged AUC.  
The efficacious exposure was reached in most of the subjects in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. As such, 
54.2% subjects achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (≥ 1 g/dL Hb increase from baseline in Week 13 to 
24) at the lowest AUCavg24 quartile (64.1 to 98.4 day•μg/mL), and 75% to 96% of subjects achieved 
the primary efficacy endpoint at higher AUCavg24 quartiles. 
The most consistent covariate predictors of the specified Hb response were splenectomy and baseline Hb.  
•  Subjects with splenectomy were less likely to achieve response, with the odds of achieving at 
least 1 g/dL Hb increase from baseline being approximately 72% to 78% lower than the odds in 
subjects without splenectomy.  
•  Subjects with higher baseline Hb were more likely to achieve response, with the odds of achieving 
at least 1 g/dL Hb increase from baseline approximately 38% to 67% higher for every 1 g/dL 
increase in baseline Hb.  
•  Subjects with β0/β0 gene mutation were less likely to achieve at least 1 g/dL Hb increase in any 
consecutive 24-week interval.  
•  Other covariates did not significantly influence the Hb-related efficacy endpoints for a given 
luspatercept exposure level (age, weight, sex, race (Asian versus non-Asian), renal function 
(mild/moderate impairment versus normal function), baseline AST, baseline total bilirubin, 
baseline erythropoietin (EPO), β-thalassemia diagnosis, and baseline RBC transfusion burden (≥ 1 
units/24 weeks versus no transfusion)). 
In Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, assessment of dose escalations suggested that the 1 mg/kg dose was 
sufficient for 69% (or 67%) of responders to achieve their first Hb ≥ 1 g/dL (or ≥ 1.5 g/dL) event in any 
12-week interval, including responders who had the 1 mg/kg dose as the only dose or as the maximum 
dose during their first response event (approximately 53% (47/88) or 50% (38/76) of responders

achieved their first response event (increase from baseline in mean Hb ≥ 1 g/dL or ≥ 1.5 g/dL)). Dose 
escalation to 1.25 mg/kg increased the incidence of first response by at least 9% (or 20%) and was 
associated with an additional 22% (or 13%) of first responses, including responders who had the 1.25 
mg/kg dose as the only dose or as the maximum dose during their first response event. Subjects 
requiring dose escalations tended to have lower exposures at the starting dose and/or disease 
characteristics affecting Hb response to luspatercept (e.g., lower baseline Hb and/or presence of 
splenectomy).

c In the Kaplan Meier plots stratified by exposure quartile, there was a difference observed among time-to-event curves. The 
relationship was not statistically significant in the Cox proportional hazards regression. 
If “E-R significant?” is Yes, higher luspatercept exposure was statistically associated with increased frequency of or shorter time to the 
specified endpoint. The “No covs” column indicates the relationship in the base model (i.e., without covariates), while the “With covs” 
column indicates the relationship in the final model, including statistically significant covariates. The statistically significant covariates in 
the model are specified in the “Significant covs” column. All covariates are at baseline. 
Integrated Safety Analysis 
Exposure-response relationship for selected TEAEs up to 60 days after the last dose in Week 1 to 48 was 
explored using the data pooled from Studies A536-04, A536-06, and ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (N = 143, 
dose range = 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg).  
In the integrated analysis for TEAEs, no positive association was found between luspatercept AUCevent 
and the probability of experiencing serious TEAEs, TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 or selected TEAEs ≥ Grade 1 
(asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, and myalgia).  
A statistically significant association with increased luspatercept AUCevent was observed for bone 
pain/arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 in Week 1 to 6 and hypertension ≥ Grade 1 in Week 1 to 48, during which the 
TEAE manifested: 
•  Subjects in the lowest AUCevent quartile group appeared to take a longer time to experience the 
first event of bone pain/arthralgia (16.7% in Week 1 to 6 versus 44% in Week 1 to 48) than 
those in the higher AUCevent quartile groups (25% to 50% in Week 1 to 6 and 33.3% to 55.6% 
in Week 1 to 48). As such, an exposure-dependent increase in bone pain/arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 was 
only observed in Week 1 to 6, not in Week 1 to 48.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 55/245 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  On the contrary, few hypertension events occurred in the first 6 weeks, and the event increased 
over time for the highest AUCevent quartile group. As such, an exposure-dependent increase in 
hypertension ≥ Grade 1 was only observed in Week 1 to 48, not in Week 1 to 6.  
Although the evaluation period influenced the statistical significance of the E-R relationship for these 
TEAEs, both bone pain/arthralgia and hypertension occurred more frequently in the luspatercept arm than 
in the placebo arm, and their occurrence is considered treatment-related and thus likely to be dependent 
on the luspatercept serum exposure level.  
Age was the only identified covariate statistically associated with both TEAEs, with older subjects more 
likely to experience these TEAEs. 
Safety analysis Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 only  
The association of luspatercept serum exposure with the probability of experiencing TEAEs or excessive 
Hb increases leading to dose modifications or treatment discontinuation was explored in Week 1 to 48 for 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 where the dose modification rules were implemented consistently across 
treatment period (N = 96, dose range = 0.6 to 1.25 mg/kg). Due to the limited number of such events in 
Week 1 to 6, only the results from Week 1 to 48 are considered informative. 
No positive association was found between luspatercept AUCevent and the probability of experiencing 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction, dose delay, or treatment discontinuation or experiencing pre-dose Hb 
increase > 2 g/dL leading to dose reduction.  
Pre-dose Hb > 11.5 g/dL leading to a dose delay was more likely and occurred sooner with increased 
luspatercept AUCevent. Baseline Hb and splenectomy were risk factors for both the probability of events 
and the time to first event. After accounting for the effects of baseline Hb and splenectomy, the effect of 
luspatercept AUCevent became insignificant for the probability of the event but remained significant for 
the time to first event. 
As shown by exposure-efficacy analyses, subjects with a higher baseline Hb or without a splenectomy 
were more likely to have a greater Hb response at higher luspatercept exposure.  
From this perspective, the underlying true cause for Hb > 11.5 g/dL remains the higher levels of drug 
exposure leading to increased Hb.

Exposure-response Relationship for NTDT-PRO T/W Scores 
Incremental Change Analysis (Week 1 to 48)  
The association of T/W improvement with Hb unit increases (in 1 g/dL increments) from baseline was 
quantitated for T/W domain score during Weeks 1 to 48.  
In luspatercept-treated subjects with a baseline T/W domain score ≥ 3, increased magnitude of T/W 
improvements was associated with increased ΔHb, ie, the greater the ΔHb level, the larger the mean 
reduction in T/W domain score. Similar results were observed for the tiredness with physical activity 
score and weakness with physical activity score. Almost all mean reductions in the specified T/W scores 
at 1 to 4 g/dL ΔHb were statistically significant compared with the corresponding score changes at zero 
ΔHb. The greatest mean reduction in T/W scores (4 to 5 points) occurred at the ΔHb level of 4 g/dL. 
Overall, a 1 g/dL increase in Hb was associated with approximately 1 point of mean reduction in each 
specified T/W score. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 62/245 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In luspatercept-treated subjects with a baseline score < 3, a statistically significant trend towards an 
improvement in the specified T/W scores with increasing ΔHb (1 to 3 g/dL) was consistently observed. 
The magnitude of improvement in these T/W scores was smaller, likely due to limited room for further 
reduction in the score. Indeed, the absolute T/W score decreased to reach near the floor during 
luspatercept treatment. Noticeably, the improvement in T/W domain score and tiredness with physical 
activity score at 1 to 3 g/dL ΔHb was statistically significant compared with the corresponding score 
change at zero ΔHb, suggesting the score improvements were associated with Hb increase even in 
subjects with a baseline T/W score < 3. 
In placebo-treated subjects, a ΔHb dependent change in the specified T/W scores was not observed 
regardless of the baseline score. In these subjects, ΔHb fluctuated over a narrow range (-1 to 1 g/dL), 
and there were no statistically significant changes in T/W scores when ΔHb increased from 0 to 1 g/dL .

Linear Mixed-effects Modelling (Double-blind Treatment Period) 
In the multivariate analysis using a linear mixed-effects model, Hb change from baseline and baseline 
T/W domain score were significant predictors (p < 0.0001) of weekly T/W domain score change from 
baseline, and the T/W domain score improvement due to Hb increase was greater at a higher baseline 
T/W domain score. The presence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (i.e., bone 
pain/arthralgia or nonspecific TEAEs ≥ Grade 1), though statistically associated with a small increase in 
weekly T/W domain score, did not materially interfere with determining T/W improvement by luspatercept 
therapy. 
The following factors were not significantly associated with the weekly NTDT-PRO domain score change 
from baseline in the multivariate analysis: age, sex, race, geographic region, β-thalassemia diagnosis, 
baseline EPO, baseline Hb levels, baseline RBC transfusion burden, baseline splenectomy, baseline liver 
iron concentration, baseline total bilirubin, baseline renal function, and absolute Hb levels during 
treatment. 
Thus, luspatercept treatment, by increasing Hb, was associated with improvement in tiredness and 
weakness across the NTD β-thalassemia population, especially in more symptomatic subjects. 
2.3.5.  Immunogenicity 
Since no subjects were tested positive to TEADA in Studies A536-04/06, the immunogenicity data are 
summarised for subjects in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 only. Additional a comparison between NTD and 
TD patients was presented. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical Strategy 
Antidrug antibodies in serum were analysed using a multi-tiered approach (screening, confirmation, 
epitope specificity, and neutralising). The methodology and assay performance of the validated methods 
have been described (MDS B-THAL Module 2 Section 2.7.1). No new analytical methods were developed 
for the current submission, but the established methods have been updated to meet current guidance 
requirements and/or qualify new batches of reagents. The assay performance for clinical studies relevant 
to the current submission were updated.  
The following methods have been updated in order to meet current guidance requirements and/or qualify 
new batches of reagents: 
•  Report 174275 addendum 4 (Report 187546): Validation for the Detection of Anti-ACE536 
Antibodies in Human Serum by an Electrochem iluminescent Assay (ECLA) 
A partial validation was performed in order to implement new positive controls  to the assay. A 
high-, mid-, and low concentration positive control was successfully qualified. No deviations 
ocurred. The MAH´s partial validation assessments confirms that the assay is still in a validated 
state. 
•  Report 176678 addendum 2 (Report 189346): Validation for the Detection of Neutralizing 
Antibodies to ACE-536 in Human Serum by ELISA 
A partial validation was performed in order to implement a positive control antibody (anti-ACE-
536 chicken polyclonal antibody). The MAH notes data generated from validation experiments are 
indicative of the positive control antibody used. The positive control most likely is a high affinity 
antibody and may not be reflective of antibodies that might be present in study subjects. Two

deviations occurred during the validation, which are related to analyst failures and do not 
interfere with the validation result. The implementation is acceptable and the data show that the 
assay is still in a validated state.  
•  Report 155-1934 (update to 207-1001): Detection of Neutralising Antibodies to ACE-031 in 
Human Serum by ELISA 
A partial validation was performed in order to test matrix selectivity on haemolysed and lipemic 
individual human serum lots, and target interference of GDF-11. All validation runs met the 
acceptance criteria. There was no observed interference from GDF-11 to the negative control. All 
haemolytic and lipemic sample matrixes were successfully implemented. Overall, the assay is fit 
for use with the indicated matrixes. 
Sampling for Determining Antidrug Antibodies in Serum 
Blood samples for assessment of ADA in serum were collected from all subjects in Study ACE-536-B-
THAL-002 at baseline (prior to the first dose), periodically throughout the treatment period at timepoints 
where drug levels were expected to be lowest (trough levels), and during the follow-up period (6 months 
from the last dose) by which time the luspatercept concentration in serum was expected to have minimal 
interference with ADA assays. The ADA sampling duration was limited to 2 years from the first dose since 
the presence of ADA was not found to be associated with adverse events in previous studies. Time-
matched PK samples were collected to facilitate the interpretation of ADA results. 
Table 25: Sampling Schedule for Determining Luspatercept Concentration and Antidrug 
Antibody (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002)
Determination of Antidrug Antibody Status 
The ADA status of a subject was determined based on the longitudinal results from the 
screening/confirmation assay for anti-luspatercept binding antibody and the titer in the confirmed 
samples as follows: 
-  Negative: All samples (baseline and post-baseline) were negative. 
- 
Positive to TEADA: 
o  At least one post-baseline sample was positive if the baseline sample was negative, or 
o  At least one post-baseline sample was positive with a titer ≥ 4-fold of the baseline titer if 
the baseline sample was positive. 
- 
Positive to pre-existing ADA: 
o  Baseline sample was positive and all post-baseline samples were negative, or  
o  Both baseline and post-baseline samples were positive, but all positive post-baseline 
sample had a titer < 4-fold of the baseline titer.

Immunogenicity Results (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002) 
Treatment-Emergent Antidrug Antibodies Against Luspatercept 
Treatment-emergent ADA against luspatercept were observed in luspatercept-treated subjects with NTD 
β-thalassemia at a low incidence: 3 (3.1%) of subjects developed binding antibodies as well as 
neutralising antibodies. However, not all TEADA appeared to be related to luspatercept treatment, as 
TEADA were also observed in 3 (6.1%) placebo-treated subjects.  
In the luspatercept treatment group, the maximum TEADA titre among subjects ranged from 11.5 to 
92.0. All 3 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group with TEADA tested positive within 233 days of 
the first dose, and 2 subjects had positive samples for more than 2 consecutive visits. No incidence of 
TEADA resulting from pre-existing ADA boosted to a higher level following luspatercept treatment (i.e. 
post-baseline ADA titre ≥ 4-fold of baseline titre) was observed in subjects with NTD β-thalassemia. 
In the luspatercept treatment group, TEADA binding to the modified ActRIIB ECD on luspatercept was 
detected in only 1 (1.0%) subject with NTD β-thalassemia. 
In the specificity binding assay, only 1 (1.0%) subject treated with luspatercept had TEADA cross-
reacting with the natural ECD of human ActRIIB. No subjects tested positive in the neutralizing assay for 
the cross-reactivity. 
Effect of Antidrug Antibody on Luspatercept Pharmacokinetics 
Inspection of dose-normalized luspatercept concentration profiles and ADA titer values from luspatercept-
treated subjects with NTD β-thalassemia found no obvious effect of TEADA. However, the small number 
of positive subjects (n=3) did not allow for definitive conclusions.

Antibody Status and Titer Level

Effect of Antidrug Antibody on Efficacy 
All 3 luspatercept-treated subjects with TEADA were good responders. All of them achieved a ≥ 1.0 g/dL 
increase from baseline in mean Hb values during Week 13 to 24 and Week 37 to 48. The longest duration 
with ≥ 1.0 g/dL increase from baseline in mean Hb over a continuous 12-week interval ranged from 319 
to 706 days. These results suggested no impact of TEADA on efficacy. 
Effect of Antidrug Antibody on Safety 
The TEAE data (as of data cut-off date of 14 Sept 2020) for the 3 subjects with TEADA were searched for 
preferred terms potentially associated with immunogenicity-like reactions based on Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities version 23. None of the 3 subjects with TEADA had immunogenicity-like reactions. 
Preexisting Antidrug Antibodies against Luspatercept 
Preexisting ADA against luspatercept (n=2), including neutralizing antibody (n=1), were observed in the 
luspatercept group but not in the placebo group. The maximum ADA titre in luspatercept-treated subjects 
(n=2) was 11.5 for pre-existing ADA.  
Table 26: Incidence of Pre-existing Antidrug Antibodies in Subjects with NTD β-thalassemia 
(ACE-536-B-THAL-002) 
An impact of pre-existing ADA on PK, efficacy, and safety of luspatercept was not observed. The pre-
existing ADA was transient, only observed prior to the first dose. Both subjects who tested positive to 
pre-existing ADA achieved a ≥ 1.0 g/dL increase from baseline in mean Hb values during Week 13 to 24 
and Week 37 to 48, and the response was durable (longest duration 507 to 914 days). No 
immunogenicity like reactions were reported for the two subjects. 
Comparison of Immunogenicity Between Subjects with Non transfusion-dependent and 
Transfusion-dependent β-Thalassemia 
There was no obvious difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies (TEADA) 
between subjects with NTD β-thalassemia and those with TD β-thalassemia.  
In the luspatercept treatment arms of the pivotal studies, TEADA against luspatercept were observed at a 
lower incidence: 3 (3.1%) in subjects with NTD β-thalassemia and 4 (1.81%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023

in subjects with TD β-thalassemia. Not all TEADAs appeared to be related to luspatercept treatment, as 
they were also observed at similar incidences in the placebo arms. However, TEADAs binding to modified 
or natural ECD of human ActRIIB or neutralising TEADAs were only observed in the luspatercept arm. 
To date, there has been no strong evidence for an association of TEADA with changes in luspatercept PK, 
efficacy and safety profiles in subjects with NTD β-thalassemia or TD β-thalassemia. 
Table 27: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Antidrug Antibodies  
Summary and Conclusions 
•  The incidence of TEADA was low in subjects with NTD β-thalassemia. Of 96 luspatercept-treated 
subjects with NTD β-thalassemia, 3 (3.1%) subjects tested positive for TEADA against 
luspatercept, with neutralizing activity. 
•  The incidence of TEADA cross-interacting with the natural ECD of human ActRIIB was 1.0%, 
suggesting a low risk of interaction with endogenous ActRIIB under luspatercept therapy. 
•  There was no clear trend between dose-normalized trough concentrations and TEADA formation, 
but the small number of positive subjects did not allow for definitive conclusions. 
•  There was no apparent loss of efficacy among subjects with TEADA, suggesting a continued 
benefit from luspatercept therapy. 
•  Subjects with TEADA did not appear to be at a higher risk for experiencing immunogenicity-like 
reactions, with no systemic hypersensitivity reactions or any other immunogenicity-like reactions 
reported for subjects tested ADA positive. 
•  Pre-existing ADA did not appear to have any effect on PK, efficacy, and safety. 
•  The low incidence of TEADAs observed in the NTD β-thalassemia population was consistent with 
that previously reported for the TD β-thalassemia population (1.81%).

2.3.6.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In Pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationship analyses, subjects with NTD β-thalassemia were 
defined as subjects who had a baseline transfusion burden of 0 to 5 RBC units/24 weeks, and subjects 
with TD β-thalassemia were defined as subjects with a baseline transfusion burden ≥ 6 RBC units/24 
weeks. Most NTD subjects had a transfusion burden of 0 at baseline and can be distinguished from TD 
subjects.  
For the characterisation of Pharmacokinetics, the MAH provided a population PK model and a separate 
representation of PK estimates for the pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 however these were also based 
on the popPK model.  
The population PK model was established previously for subjects with TD β-thalassemia (submitted with 
the initial MAA) and was updated by including subjects with NTD β-thalassemia from Study ACE-536-B-
THAL-002. However, the population of NTD patients is limited (N=127) and represents only a third of the 
total population available for the Pharmacology analyses and respective samples only represent about a 
quarter of all samples. While the overrepresentation of samples from TD patients could potentially 
influence the results, the developed model seems to describe the data well for both populations. Some 
minor differences have however been observed. The VPC plots indicate that the 95th percentile of the 
model predictions seems to be wider compared to the observed data. This could also be influenced by the 
more limited dataset from study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, potentially increasing the variability of the data. 
Nevertheless, a slight difference between populations can also not be excluded. However, since the 
general tendency seems to be predicted well, the deviation in the 95th percentile is not regarded as a 
concern but this should be kept in mind when interpreting the data and consecutive analyses. 
Only slight differences have been observed between NTD and TD patients (higher CL/F and consequently 
lower Cmax(SS)) but were not statistically significant. 
A 27% to 41% higher mean AUCss in subjects with mild to moderate renal function compared to normal 
renal function has been observed. No dose adjustments are recommended for these special populations. 
On the other hand, the MAH also states that the maximum dose should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg every 3 
weeks. The MAH refers to the intended general dose adjustments. While it is acknowledged that this 
might be sufficient in case the dose is lowered when the normal starting dose would not be well tolerated, 
a potential dose increase in case of insufficient efficacy cannot be excluded. In this case, the expected 
exposure would exceed the so far observed data, especially for patients with moderate renal impairment. 
However, only data for four patients with moderate renal impairment are available preventing any 
conclusions. Consequently, the MAH’s arguments are mainly based on patients with mild renal 
impairment. A starting dose of 1mg/kg seems acceptable for both populations (mild and moderate) given 
that recommendations for regular monitoring are included in the SmPC. Special focus should be placed on 
the identified long term risk (please refer to the safety discussion and the respective discussion of the 
Benefit Risk balance section). Regarding subjects with severe renal impairment no dose recommendations 
can be made, which is acknowledged by the MAH, consequently these patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions and dose adjustment should be managed accordingly (see Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC). 
Overall, mean AUCss was 36% or 41% higher in subjects who achieved ≥ 1 g/dL or 1.5 g/dL increase 
from baseline in mean Hb value during Week 13 to 24 (primary efficacy endpoint) than those who did not 
(starting dose of 1 mg/kg). This suggests a relation between AUCss and response.  
The MAH presented data derived from the analysis of PK data separately for study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
although PK parameters were derived from the final popPK model. The data was grouped into three 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 70/245 
 
 
 
categories (no dose modifications, one dose increase, all others). No distinction between the time points 
when dose escalations have been made has been presented for the second category and no distinction 
between modifications was performed at all in the last categories. However, similar concentrations at day 
315 were observed for all categories which is reassuring but overall variability is high. Meaningful 
conclusion are further hampered by the limited number of patients. However, similar observations have 
been made in TD patients in the initial MAA. 
In general non-responder showed a faster clearance (CL, t1/2) and consequently a lower AUCSS was 
observed. The MAH was asked to discuss a potential target exposure range that could help identifying 
patients / subgroups that might not reach sufficient response or are more likely in need of higher or lower 
doses, but the currently available data is too variable to allow a meaningful approach. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In order to characterise the Pharmacodynamic effect an analysis of haematology mean values over time 
was submitted based on the data from study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. Further, the MAH provided several 
exposure-response models including response parameter including Hb level, efficacy and safety 
parameter. In addition, the potential association between change in Hb level from baseline and 
parameters from the patient reported outcomes (tiredness/weakness) was investigated. 
Haematology mean values over time: 
The MAH claims that mean serum EPO values over time were generally higher in the luspatercept 
treatment group than in the placebo treatment group. This cannot entirely be followed, since high 
variability between the two groups was observed. At some time points, mean serum EPO values were 
higher in the placebo treatment group. No clear trend can be observed for mean serum EPO levels. 
The increase in mean reticulocyte counts from baseline in the luspatercept treatment group is expected 
owing to luspatercept’s mode of action. It is however critically noted that the increase of reticulocyte 
counts was observed late during the study, when data from the placebo group (but also the luspatercept 
group) were rather limited due to low patient numbers.  
Nucleated RBCs indicate the presence of circulating immature RBC in response to chronic anaemia, which 
is a common clinical feature of β-thalassaemia. Luspatercept treatment aims at improving erythropoiesis 
and consequently a decrease of nucleated RBCs would be expected. Unexpectedly however, decreases of 
nucleated RBCs were of higher magnitude in the placebo treatment group. It is unclear whether the 
difference of nucleated RBCs at baseline might indicate any possible difference in phenotype, whether this 
difference could have an impact on the efficacy of luspatercept and how nucleated RBCs correlate with Hb 
or clinical presentation.  
These aspects regarding the more frequent occurrence of EMH masses are discussed in the Clinical Safety 
section below. 
Exposure-response Analysis for the Time Course of Haemoglobin 
The MAH presented an Emax-model describing the time course of Haemoglobin in response to 
luspatercept treatment. Only Hb data for NTD patients is available due to the frequent RBC transfusions 
in the TD population influencing the Hb values. Overall, the applied methods are acceptable and the 
model seems to describe the data well. Only slight trends are observed for overprediction of the 95th 
percentile and underprediction of the 50th percentile, especially for data from study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
This might be caused by the respective effects on exposure observed in the population PK model for NTD 
patients potentially caused by the overrepresentation of the TD population. No concerns are raised but 
this should be kept in mind when interpreting the data and consecutive analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 71/245 
 
 
 
The developed model seems to adequately describe the time course of Hb in response to luspatercept 
dose levels 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg administered Q3W to subjects with NTDT. The MAH also acknowledged that 
the estimated Emax and EC50 values should not be extrapolated outside the luspatercept dose levels 
used to derive these parameters. 
The MAH states that the model associated luspatercept serum concentration with its stimulatory effect on 
Hb input into blood, which is agreed. Further, the model suggested a shorter Hb lifespan and fast Hb 
input rate, consistent with accelerated RBC destruction and compensatory erythroid marrow expansion in 
subjects with NTDT. 
Exposure-response Analysis for Efficacy 
The relationship between luspatercept serum exposure and Hb-related efficacy endpoints (responder with 
≥ 1 or 1.5 g/dL Hb increase from baseline) was evaluated for subjects with NTDT applying ordinal logistic 
regression analyses. Different dose ranges and different evaluation periods were analysed (0.2 to 1.25 
mg/kg during the first 15 weeks of treatment; 0.6 to 1.25 mg/kg during early (Week 13 to 24), late 
(Week 37 to 48) and any consecutive 12-weeks or 24-weeks). In all evaluation periods, the results were 
similar and showed an exposure-dependent increase in Hb response which was consistent in frequency, 
magnitude and duration. Splenectomy and baseline Hb have been identified as predictive covariates. 
Subjects with splenectomy were less likely to achieve response (72% to 78% lower odds to reach at least 
1 g/dL Hb increase). Subjects with higher baseline Hb were more likely to achieve response (38% to 67% 
higher for every 1 g/dL increase in baseline Hb). In addition, subjects with β0/β0 gene mutation were less 
likely to achieve at least 1 g/dL Hb increase in any consecutive 24-week interval. The MAH provided 
simulations that indicate that even for a subject with a combination of splenectomy, low baseline Hb and 
β0/β0 gene mutation the probability of achieving ≥ 1 g/dL mean Hb increase in the 24-week interval is 
23%, which is higher than placebo (6%). While it can be agreed that based on the identified covariates 
no subgroup exists for which no response can be expected, it seems that an increase in dose would 
increase the probability of response also for these patients.  
The MAH claims that the analysis confirmed the appropriateness of the 1 mg/kg starting dose and 
suggested that dose escalation to 1.25 mg/kg improved the Hb response. While it is agreed that the 
analysis indicates an improvement after dose escalation for some patients, it is also observed that 
subjects requiring dose escalations tended to have lower exposures with the starting dose and/or disease 
characteristics affecting Hb response to luspatercept. The MAH was asked to discuss whether a higher 
starting dose might be beneficial in certain subgroups. The MAH referred to the existing titration regimen 
and that certain safety risks are related to a higher dose. While certain patient subgroups exists that 
would likely benefit from a higher starting dose, the MAH’s more conservative approach is appreciated. 
Further, since no clinical data with a higher starting dose exist that would elucidate the respective safety 
profile of a higher starting dose, this issue is currently not further pursued. Nevertheless, the MAH is 
encouraged to investigate a higher starting dose in the future to improve the benefit of such patients. 
Respective data might also overall strengthen the presented pharmacology analyses. 
Exposure-response Analysis for Safety 
The potential associations of exposure with selected TEAEs up to 60 days after the last dose and with the 
probability of experiencing TEAEs or excessive Hb increases leading to dose modifications or treatment 
discontinuation were explored in Week 1 to 48.  
In the analysis 16 subjects in study A536-06 were considered as “new” subjects due to their having 
treatment interruption (≥ 84 ± 7 days) between the last dose in Study A536-04 and the first dose in 
Study A536-06. The MAH provided a separate exposure-safety analysis for key TEAEs excluding the 16 
“new” subjects in order to show that no significant differences can be found. The analysis is appreciated

Page 72/245 
 
 
 
 
but in contrast to the MAH’s claim, difference are observed, e.g. regarding Bone pain/Arthralgia ≥ Grade 
1, Week 1-6, but overall the results are in line. A bias can, however, not be excluded even though the 
MAH claims that 50% of these patients did only receive small doses and did not show a treatment effect 
in the first study. But neither did they experience any AEs that prevented them to enrol in the second 
study. This issue is however not further pursued from a pharmacological perspective. 
There was no positive association between luspatercept serum exposure and the probability of 
experiencing serious TEAEs, TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 or selected TEAEs ≥ Grade 1 (asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, 
and myalgia), and TEAEs leading to dose reduction, dose interruption or treatment discontinuation.  
Statistically significant associations with increased luspatercept AUCevent were observed for bone 
pain/arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 in Week 1 to 6 and hypertension ≥ Grade 1 in Week 1 to 48: 
While the effect of bone pain/arthralgia was observed in week 1 - 6, the effect was not as pronounced in 
the longer observation period up to week 48 although a respective trend is also observed. Bone 
pain/arthralgia is also more frequently observed in the treatment arm compared to the placebo arm. This 
TEAE is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Only few hypertension events occurred in the first 6 weeks but this increased over time, especially for the 
highest AUCevent quartile group. In addition, hypertension occurred more frequently in the luspatercept 
arm than in the placebo arm and is considered treatment-related. The majority of such events occurred 
during the first year of treatment. Based on the data provided upon request (treatment duration approx. 
168 weeks), an increased risk over time after one year of treatment is not apparent but it is apparent 
that most events required either dose reduction or interruption or additional medication. How this will 
evolve with long term treatment will be evaluated in the LTFU study in the post marketing (please see 
Clinical Safety and RMP sections).  
Although hypertension is already included in the SmPC as common adverse reaction, the additional 
burden of an adverse reaction that might require another long term treatment is of concern and is 
considered accordingly in the benefit –risk assessment. Further, an increased risk with age was also 
identified as statistically associated with hypertension events, with older subjects being more likely to 
experience hypertension. The MAH acknowledged the increase of hypertension events after 6 weeks but 
considers them manageable with dose delay.  
Of note, no such effect was observed in the other populations (MDS and TD β-thalassaemia) but the dose 
range might have been too small to allow detection of a respective exposure-response association.  
The MAH claims that based on the above clinical experience, a dose reduction should be considered for 
patients with hypertension ≥ Grade 3, which is endorsed. Further, dose delay may be considered for 
lower grade hypertension. Acceptable recommendations for grade 2 events have been suggested.  
Exposure-response Relationship for NTDT-PRO T/W Scores 
The MAH presented two analyses to describe the potential association between the haemoglobin change 
and the change in NTDT-PRO T/W Domain Score: an incremental change analysis and a linear mixed-
effects model.  
The MAH claims that the model provided a good fit to the observed data, but this is not agreed on. 
Although the provided VPC-plots are missing an appropriate presentation of percentiles, it can be 
observed that the model does not fit the data well. The observed data seems to be included in the 
predicted 95% CI mainly due to the generally high variability, potentially caused by the nature of the 
used PRO and the limited dataset. Further, the data suggests that a linear model might not be the best 
model for the underlying data, but no non-linear model has been tested. Overall, the model is not 
considered appropriate and the respective results should be interpreted with care.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 73/245 
 
 
 
 
The MAH claims that the presented analyses show a clear association between change in Hb and 
improvement in the tiredness/weakness (T/W) score. While it is acknowledged that there seems to be a 
trend that patients with higher change in Hb also show a more pronounced improvement in T/W scores, 
conclusions are prevented by the rather limited number of subjects in each category and the overall high 
variability of the data. Further, the data is not consistent, e.g., it has been observed that patients with no 
change in Hb seem to improve more while receiving placebo compared to luspatercept. Overall, the 
analysis is not considered reliable. 
Immunogenicity 
Treatment emergent antibodies were only detected in 3 subjects (3.1%). All three showed neutralising 
antibodies (all in study ACE-536-B-THAL-002; A536-04/06: 0 patients). The results are in line with the 
results found in the TD population. There seems to be no clear association of TEADAs with PK, efficacy or 
safety observations based on this study but the limited dataset prevents final conclusions. Further, in the 
population PK model, a potential effect of ADA was not tested as there were less than 10 ADA-positive 
subjects in the complete dataset (4 studies). Nevertheless, as there are stopping rules foreseen for lack 
of effect in section 4.2 of the SmPC, a possible loss of efficacy due to immunogenicity would not lead to 
prolonged and unnecessary drug exposure of affected patients. 
2.3.7.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK parameter of NTD patients seem to be similar to TD patients.  
The PD effect other than on Hb levels was not further characterised by the MAH, and some aspects 
concerning haematology mean values over time (nucleated reticulocytes, reticulocytes, EPO levels) 
cannot be entirely followed in relation to the mode of action. Please refer to the safety section for a 
discussion in relation with the observed adverse reaction EMH.  
The presented exposure-response models for haemoglobin, efficacy and safety endpoints are overall 
acceptable. Although potentially manageable with dose modifications or additional medication, the 
occurrence of hypertension events is still considered an uncertainty in this procedure, especially for less 
severely affected NTDT patients.  
The model concerning the PRO T/W is not considered reliable.

Approximately 150 subjects diagnosed with NTDT, with a documented diagnosis of β-thalassemia or 
HbE/β-thalassemia, with or without concomitant α-globin mutation and/or duplication were planned for 
enrollment.  
After signing the ICF, subjects entered the Screening Period for up to 4 weeks (± 3 days) for safety and 
other assessments (incl. Haemoglobin [Hb]) to determine subject eligibility. If a subject received 
transfusions during the 24 weeks prior to randomization, 24 weeks of transfusion history (including units 
or volume transfused and pretransfusion Hb level) was to be recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF). If a subject received Iron chelation Therapy (ICT) during the 24 weeks prior to randomization, 24 
weeks of ICT use history (including types of ICT and doses) was to be recorded in the eCRF.  
The duration of study participation for each individual subject was approximately 4 weeks in the 
Screening Period and at least 48 weeks in the DBTP. The duration of the OLP is a maximum of 15 
months, and the duration in the PTFP could be 5 years from the first dose of study drug or 3 years from 
the last dose of study drug (whichever occurs later) until EOS. The end of treatment for each individual 
subject was defined as the date of the last study drug dose in the DBTP or OLP. The EOS for each 
individual subject was defined as occurring after study unblinding (ie, 48 weeks after the last subject 
received the first dose of study drug) and the OLP or the PTFP were completed, as appropriate, or at EOS, 
whichever was later. 
The study was unblinded after completion of the DBTP for evaluation of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints. The OLP is ongoing as is the overarching LTFU study, where all luspatercept-treated 
patients can roll over to. The overall study design is presented in Figure 28.

a The dose could be titrated up to a maximum of 1.25 mg/kg. 
b The DBTP ended after the last subject enrolled had completed 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier, or when the study was unblinded. 
c The study was unblinded 48 weeks after last subject received the first dose of study drug (ie, IP). At that time, subjects still benefiting from 
luspatercept treatment as well as subjects who received placebo and who were assessed per protocol up to 48 weeks after the first dose of study drug 
(even if they discontinued the study drug before completing 48 weeks of treatment) could enter the OLP to receive luspatercept for a maximum of 15 
months on the basis of DMC recommendations after unblinded data review, and could continue treatment in the rollover study after EOS up to 5 years 
after Dose 1 or study drug discontinuation, whichever occurs later. 
d Subjects in the DBTP who discontinued luspatercept before study unblinding were to continue the PTFP until EOS, could continue the PTFP in the 
rollover study for up 5 years after the first dose of study drug or 3 years after the last dose (whichever occurs later), and could complete the PTFP 
under the rollover study. Subjects in the DBTP who discontinued placebo before study unblinding continued the PTFP until study unblinding and could 
access the OLP after recommendation by the DMC. 
Monitoring was performed by an independent external data monitoring committee (DMC) that reviewed 
the unblinded safety data regularly during the course of the study in accordance with the guidelines for 
the pre-planned analyses. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Laboratory assessments could be repeated within the screening window or initially screen-failed subjects 
could be rescreened using a new subject number assigned by the interactive response technology (IRT). 
Relevant information about subjects classified as screen failures was to be collected on the appropriate 
eCRFs and in a screening log. 
Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects were required to satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled into the study: 
1. Subject was required to be ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF.

pregnancy, she was required to agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without 
interruption, 28 days prior to starting study drug, during treatment with the study drug (including dose 
interruptions), and for 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the mean t½ of luspatercept based on multiple-
dose PK data) after discontinuation of study drug. 
10. A male subject must: a. Have practiced true abstinence (which must have been reviewed on a 
monthly basis) or agreed to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or an FCBP** 
while participating in the study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 12 weeks (approximately 5 
times the mean t½ of luspatercept based on multiple-dose PK data) following study drug discontinuation, 
even if he had undergone a successful vasectomy. 
Exclusion criteria 
The presence of any of the following excluded a subject from enrolment: 
1. Subject had any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would 
have prevented the subject from participating in the study. 
2. Subject had any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which placed the subject 
at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

allowed: 
- Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 
- Carcinoma in situ of the cervix 
- Carcinoma in situ of the breast 
- Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b using the tumour, nodes, metastasis clinical 
staging system) 
Treatments 
Luspatercept or placebo was administered as an SC injection to subjects by the study site staff at the 
study site and administration was documented in the subject’s source record. Subcutaneous injections 
were given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen. Calculated doses requiring reconstituted volume of 
> 1.2 mL were to be divided into 2 separate similar volume injections across 2 separate body sites using 
the same anatomical location but on the opposite sides of the body (left thigh and right thigh). The 
maximum volume per SC injection was not to exceed 1.2 mL. Rotation of injection sites was possible 
according to investigator’s judgment, and the injections could be given in the following order as needed: 
(1) right upper arm; (2) left upper arm; (3) right upper thigh; and (4) left upper thigh. 
In the DBTP, subjects were assigned to the study drug per 1 of the following regimens: 
- Luspatercept starting dose level 1.00 mg/kg SC q3w 
- Placebo SC q3w 
Rationale for placebo control: Given the lack of approved and/or effective agents to address anemia or 
ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia, placebo plus BSC was considered an appropriate comparison 
treatment. The placebo treatment group was necessary for the assessment of adverse events (AEs), 
which could be due to potential comorbid complications associated with the disease and/or caused by 
study drug. A placebo comparator was also required for the assessment of HRQoL and other measures 
included in the secondary objectives of this study because historical control data would not provide a 
robust comparison. 
Dose strategy 
Dose 1 Day 1 was to be scheduled within 3 days of randomization (and could occur on the same day as 
randomization). All subjects assigned to receive luspatercept received the starting dose of 1.00 mg/kg SC 
q3w. Mean increases in Hb not influenced by a transfusion (ie, Hb ≥ 21 days after transfusion) were to be 
considered when determining dose escalation, dose reduction, dose delay, and study drug 
discontinuation. Dose levels available for titration are shown in Table 28.

Dose Escalation 
Luspatercept dose escalation was permitted up to 1.25 mg/kg during the DBTP and OLP. The dose 
escalation criteria were defined as follows: 
- Dose escalation was permitted if, at a constant dose level, the increase of mean Hb (uninfluenced by 
transfusions, ie, > 21 days after transfusion) over 2 cycles (6 weeks) was < 1.0 g/dL, compared with the 
baseline Hb value (mean of 2 values 1 week apart within 4 weeks of randomization). 
- Dose escalation was permitted if, at a constant dose level, the increase of mean Hb (uninfluenced by 
transfusions, ie, > 21 days after transfusion) over 2 cycles (6 weeks) was ≥ 1.0 but < 2.0 g/dL compared 
with the baseline Hb value (mean of 2 values 1 week apart within 4 weeks of randomization). 
The starting dose with dose reductions and escalations are presented in Table 28. Subjects who had dose 
reductions due to any treatment-related (ie, related to the study drug) Grade ≥ 3 AE, as indicated in 
Table 29, were not permitted to have dose escalations during the DBTP. However, if requested by the 
investigator, a dose increase to the next higher dose level was possible with sponsor’s permission after 
safety and efficacy data review. 
Placebo for use in the study was sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection) administered 
as an SC injection. Designated individuals prepared the placebo syringes to match the active syringes. All 
study staff, except unblinded pharmacists and designated personnel were blinded. The manufacturer’s 
directions for placebo storage and handling were to be followed, as were standard clinical practices for 
ensuring sterility of the placebo. 
In the OLP, subjects previously randomized to receive placebo were to be assigned to receive 
luspatercept (starting dose level 1.00 mg/kg q3w) and subjects previously randomized to luspatercept 
were to continue on their last assigned dose. 
Dose Reduction and Dose Delay 
Dose reduction and/or dose delay was possible based on the change in mean Hb level (Hb not influenced 
by a transfusion) and/or based on the experience of AEs. Details of dose modification requirements are 
provided in Table 29. 
If a subject had a dose delay due to Hb increase, Hb measurement was to be performed every week. 
If the dose delay was > 15 weeks from the last dose administered, including cases of elective  
surgery/hospitalization, treatment with the study drug was to be discontinued. 
The following assessments were to be performed during the dose delay period:  
- All planned Day 1 assessments were to be performed (Table 29) and appropriate samples were to be 
sent to the central laboratory, regardless of the reason for the dose delay. 
- If the dose delay was due to increased Hb (Table 28), heamatology assessments were to be performed 
on Day 1 of the dose delay by the central and local laboratory and at least weekly thereafter by the local

laboratory until the subject met either the study drug administration criteria or the study drug 
discontinuation criteria. 
If dose delay was due to AE or laboratory or vital signs abnormality (Table 29), any clinically indicated 
assessment was to be repeated by the local laboratory at a frequency decided by the investigator until 
the subject met either the study drug administration criteria or the study drug discontinuation criteria. 
- Samples for PK and ADA assessments were to be performed on Day 1 of the dose delay and before the 
next dose (if applicable). 
- At the time of study drug administration after a dose delay, the scheduled dosing visit assessments 
were to be performed, regardless of the duration of the dose delay.

Study Drug Administration Criteria 
On dosing days, administration of the study drug at the same dose level could occur if the following 
criteria were met: 
1. Predose Hb, measured on the dosing day (or the day before dosing) by local laboratory, was < 11.5 
g/dL. If the predose Hb level was ≥ 11.5 g/dL, study sites were to check if the subject was transfused 
within 21 days prior to current dose and review the pretransfusion Hb. If this was < 11.5 g/dL, the 
subject could be dosed, otherwise the dose was to be delayed. If this occurred at Dose 1, the dose was to 
be delayed until Hb level was < 11.5 g/dL. If this occurred at subsequent doses, the dose was to be 
delayed until Hb level was ≤ 11.0 g/dL. 
2. Increase in Hb level of < 2.0 g/dL compared with the Hb level on Day 1 of previous dose. 
3. Absence of treatment-related AE of Grade ≥ 2 severity according to NCI CTCAE criteria on dosing day. 
4. Predose white blood cell (WBC) count (corrected by erythroblast count) < 3 x baseline and absence of 
Grade 3 leukocytosis on dosing day. 
5. Leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia were Grade < 3 per NCI CTCAE criteria. 
6. No decrease of > 2.0 g/dL Hb level from baseline (uninfluenced by transfusion); or subject became 
regularly transfused in combination with an unexplained shift from baseline (worsening) by ≥ 2 grades in 
leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia (Table 29). 
Best supportive care (BSC) was permitted in both the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups 
during the DBTP and OLP, including RBC transfusions, ICT, treatments for anemia, antibiotic therapy, 
antiviral and antifungal therapy, and nutritional support as needed. Treatment with hydroxyurea would 
lead to treatment discontinuation. 
Concurrent therapy with a new prescription medication related to the treatment of anemia during the 
course of the study required discussion with the sponsor medical monitor or delegate prior to 
administration, unless the medication needed to begin before the medical monitor could be consulted, as 
medically indicated. If treatment with hydroxyurea was required during the DBTP, the subject was to be 
discontinued from treatment with the study drug and entered into the PTFP. 
The use of ICT starting from at least 24 weeks prior to Dose 1 Day 1 was to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Concurrent treatment with ICT was to be used per the product label and investigator practice. 
Initiation of anticoagulant therapies and platelet aggregation inhibitors was permitted during the 
treatment periods only if their use was not due to an AE considered related to the study drug that would 
lead to dose delay (Table 29). Anticoagulant therapies (for prophylaxis and for surgery or high-risk 
procedures) and low molecular weight heparin (for superficial vein thrombosis), and chronic and 
prophylactic aspirin were allowed before and during the study. 
Red blood cell transfusions and transfusion rules 
Concurrent treatment for anemia with blood transfusions was allowed, at the discretion of the 
investigator, for low Hb levels, symptoms associated with anemia (eg, hemodynamic or pulmonary 
compromise requiring treatment), or comorbidities. 
For any RBC transfusions received during the study, information to be collected included Hb values just 
prior to transfusion, the number of units transfused, and the dates of transfusion. If available, the volume 
transfused in mL at each transfusion and the hematocrit of the transfused unit were to be collected. 
Prohibited medications were any other investigational agents as well as Hydroxyurea, ESAs, and 
anagrelide during the treatment periods.

Rationale for efficacy endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was based on Hb levels because correcting anemia and reducing the need 
for RBC transfusions are unmet needs in the treatment of NTDT. The endpoint was defined as the 
proportion of subjects who had an increase in Hb from baseline of ≥ 1.0 g/dL over 12 weeks because a 
mean increase in Hb of ≥ 1.0 g/dL is expected to result in a clinically meaningful reduction in associated 
symptoms and risks of complications (Taher, 2015b). This degree of response was demonstrated in Study 
A536-04 to be unlikely to occur by chance: a sustained Hb increase of ≥ 1.0 g/dL over a 12-week period 
was not observed with subtherapeutic luspatercept dose levels of 0.20 to 0.40 mg/kg, whereas it was 
achieved at therapeutic dose levels of 0.60 to 1.25 mg/kg. This endpoint is also consistent with current 
guidelines, which recommend response evaluations after 3 and 6 months of therapy, with response 
defined as an increase of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at 6 months (Taher, 2013). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 87/245 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included NTDT-PRO, FACIT-F Fatigue subscale, and Medical Outcomes 
Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; version 2.0) assessments to allow evaluation of the 
further clinical relevance of treatment with luspatercept in addressing the fatigue, weakness, shortness of 
breath (SoB), and other symptoms influencing HRQoL that are associated with chronic anemia in adults 
with β-thalassemia. Iron overload, use of ICT, and the presence of osteoporosis or osteopenia were also 
assessed as secondary endpoints because these are additional complications stemming from ineffective 
erythropoiesis. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was also included to provide an objective assessment of 
functional exercise capacity and thus evaluate whether increased Hb levels were associated with 
increased walk distances, which were also expected to correlate with improvements in HRQoL (Musallam, 
2021b). 
Sample size 
Based on the assumption of a targeted primary endpoint response rate of at least 50.0% in the 
luspatercept treatment group and 10.0% in the placebo treatment group and based on a 2:1 
randomization, a total sample size of 150 subjects (100 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group and 
50 subjects in the placebo treatment group) was expected to have at least 99% power to detect the 
difference between the 2 treatment groups with a 2-sided α-level of 0.05 with an assumed 10.0% 
dropout rate. 
For NTDT-PRO T/W domain scores, the mean changes from baseline scores at Week 24 were assumed to 
be 1.2 and 0.5 for the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively, with a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 1.2. The statistical power to detect the difference was expected to be 91%. 
Randomisation 
Study drug assignment (randomization) occurred at the end of the Screening Period, after all the required 
screening procedures had been completed and all required data had been submitted to the sponsor or its 
authorised representative. Upon receiving acknowledgment of subject eligibility from the sponsor or its 
authorised representative, the subject was assigned the study drug using the IRT. 
The IRT was used to ensure an equal weight central randomization based on block randomization method 
according to stratification factors. The IRT used a randomization algorithm to associate the subject 
identification number with a randomization number and placed each subject in the next available slot 
within the appropriate stratum for that subject based on the stratification factors. 
Designated research personnel at each study site were assigned password-protected, coded identification 
numbers to allow them to access the IRT to enrol subjects. For study drug assignment at the start of 
each dose and in the event of any dose reduction or dose escalation, study site staff were required to 
contact the IRT to record the new dose level and obtain the new study drug assignment. 
The following stratification factors were chosen: 
•  Baseline Hb level (< 8.5 or ≥ 8.5 g/dL) 
•  NTDT patient-reported outcome (PRO; NTDT-PRO) Tiredness/Weakness (T/W) domain score 
(score ≥ 3 or < 3) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 88/245 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rationale: 
The baseline Hb category was used as a randomization stratification factor because Hb response is likely 
to be influenced by the degree of anemia at baseline. Previous Phase 2 studies have shown that response 
rates (mean Hb increase of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at 12 weeks) among subjects with NTDT treated with luspatercept 
≥ 0.8 mg/kg were higher for subjects having a baseline Hb of < 8.5 g/dL compared with subjects having a 
baseline Hb of ≥ 8.5 g/dL.  
The threshold of ≥ 3 on the T/W domain of the NTDT-PRO to define symptomatic subjects was based on 
Phase 2 study results that demonstrated an association of improvement in symptoms, particularly T/W, 
with erythroid response. Tiredness and weakness can thus be used as a key secondary endpoint to 
support the primary efficacy endpoint of increase in Hb and a clinically meaningful benefit with 
luspatercept treatment. The appropriateness of the 3-point cut-off used in this study to categorise 
subjects as asymptomatic or symptomatic for randomization stratification is supported by the following 
data and analyses: 
- The determination of this threshold involved estimating a population norm for the T/W domain score 
and then using this base rate estimate to define symptomatic patients. Because population norms are not 
available for the NTDT-PRO, population norms for the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - 
Fatigue (FACIT-F) Fatigue subscale were used. A linear regression analysis of Phase 2 data (Study A536-
06) showed a correlation of -0.77 between the FACIT-F Fatigue subscale and NTDT-PRO T/W domain 
score, and the regression equation indicated that the T/W domain score decreased by 0.2 points for every 
1 unit increase in the FACIT-F. The base rate estimate for the general population on the FACIT-F Fatigue 
subscale of 44.2 (on a scale from 0 to 52; Cella, 2002) corresponded with a score on the NTDT-PRO of 
2.5 (on a scale from 0 to 10). Based on this analysis, a T/W domain score of ≥ 3 at screening was 
considered to be indicative of a subject with symptomatic NTDT. In analyses using Phase 2 (Study 
A536-06) data for the FACIT-F Fatigue subscale and available NTDT-PRO T/W domain scores, subjects 
who had baseline T/W domain scores of < 3 did not have meaningful decreases in symptom severity 
(defined as a decrease of ≥ 1 unit on the T/W domain score), regardless of their Hb response, 
suggesting a low likelihood of observing symptom improvement in subjects with baseline 
scores of < 3. 
- A confirmation of the threshold was completed using data from the present study (ACE-536-B-THAL-
002). A receiver operating characteristic analysis using the FACIT-F Fatigue subscale cutoff of 43, 
which best divides anemic cancer patients and the general population (Cella, 2002) was 
performed, and an optimal cutoff of 3.04 on the NTDT-PRO T/W domain score was identified based on the 
cutoff value corresponding to the maximum Youden index. The area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC) was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80, 0.86), indicating a good discriminant power 
(Bekkar, 2013). This cutoff yielded 73.0% sensitivity and 76.0% specificity, and 74.0% of subjects were 
correctly classified. 
Blinding (masking) 
When properly mixed, Reblozyl reconstituted solution is a colourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly 
opalescent solution which is free of visible foreign particulate matter. 
All subjects, study site staff, and sponsor representatives, with the exception of designated individuals 
(e.g., the pharmacist at the investigational site), were to remain blinded to all study drug assignments 
until all subjects enrolled in the study had completed 48 weeks of double-blind treatment or had 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 89/245 
 
 
 
 
discontinued before reaching 48 weeks of double-blind treatment, whichever was the earlier date, or at 
the time the study was unblinded (per DMC recommendation) and the database was locked. 
The designated site individual (eg, the pharmacist) at the study site was to use a syringe (that exactly 
matched the syringe used for reconstituted luspatercept) and sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride 
for injection) to prepare a matching placebo. Thus, the designated site individual at the study site was 
unblinded and gave investigators and study site staff luspatercept and placebo syringes in a blinded 
manner. 
The blind was not to be broken during the course of the study unless, in the opinion of the investigator, 
unblinding was absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it was medically imperative to know 
what study drug a subject was receiving, and/or if, in the opinion of the investigator, continuing study 
drug could negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment, study drug was to be temporarily 
discontinued. 
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remained the responsibility of the investigator 
and was not to be delayed or refused by the sponsor. However, the investigator had the option to contact 
the medical monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the interest of the 
subject. 
The investigator was to ensure that the code was broken only in accordance with the protocol. 
The investigator was to promptly notify the medical monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason 
for breaking the blind, which was to be clearly documented by the investigator in the subject’s source 
documentation. Emergency unblinding was to only be performed by the investigator through the IRT. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy evaluations were conducted using the ITT population, except for FACIT-F Fatigue Subscale and 
SF-36 analyses, which were conducted based on the HRQoL evaluable population. The NTDT-PRO T/W 
and SoB domain scores were analysed by both ITT and HRQoL evaluable populations. The primary and 
key secondary efficacy endpoints were also analysed based on the PP population as a sensitivity analysis. 
Some continuous variables like Hb and weekly NTDT-PRO T/W and SoB domain scores were derived as 
the sum of results over 12 weeks divided by the number of assessments. The mean over 12 weeks was 
used to derive the mean change from baseline for each subject. 
The efficacy cut-off date was defined as the minimum date among death date, study discontinuation date, 
last dose date + 20, and data cut-off date. For the primary and responder-related secondary efficacy 
endpoints, if at the time of data summary, a subject’s efficacy cut-off date was before the end of the 12-
week interval or a subject had any invalid Hb records (i.e., within 21 days following a transfusion) during 
the specified 12-week interval, this subject was included in the analysis and his/her responder status was 
classified in accordance with the definition of erythroid response (i.e., as responder when they had an 
increase from baseline of ≥ 1.0 g/dL in the mean of Hb values over a predefined continuous 12-week 
interval in the absence of transfusions; otherwise they were classified as non-responder). For other 
efficacy endpoints, if a subject’s efficacy cut-off date was before the end of the 12-week interval, the 
subject was included in the analyses. 
In order to assess the robustness of the findings of the primary and key secondary analyses of Hb 
response and change from baseline, missing values for binary responder/non-responder values were 
imputed using the non-responder imputation method and for continuous values, the complete case 
analysis. The supportive/sensitivity analyses uses for binary Hb outcomes the complete case analysis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 90/245 
 
 
 
 
which excluded all subjects with missing data. A tipping point analysis was also used, in which the 
missing data from all responder statuses were turned to all non-responder statuses, one-by-one, to find 
the tipping point value. For continuous values the supportive/sensitivity analysis used postbaseline mean 
imputation, baseline imputation, or multiple imputation methods. 
Regarding missing continuous and categorical assessments for the HRQoL, the complete case analysis 
was used for the Week 13 to Week 24 analysis. For the key secondary efficacy endpoint (NTDT-PRO T/W 
domain score at Week 13 to Week 24), the supportive/sensitivity analysis used the postbaseline mean 
imputation, the baseline imputation, or multiple imputation methods to assess the robustness of the 
primary result. 
To assess the extent of missing data at each assessment visit by treatment group, compliance rates for 
the NTDT-PRO, FACIT-F, and SF-36 assessments at each scheduled visit were provided. The compliance 
rate for the NTDT at each visit was defined as the number of subjects with at least half of 6 weekly item 
scores for that week being non missing (ie, ≥ 3 items) divided by the number of subjects in the ITT 
population who were still expected to provide a PRO assessment at that time point. Compliance rates for 
FACIT-F and SF-36 were defined as the number of subjects with at least 80.0% of the 40 items (ie, ≥ 32 
items) and at least 50.0% of the 36 items (ie, ≥ 18 items), respectively. 
Statistical comparisons were made between the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups. All statistical 
tests were 2-sided at the significance level of α = 0.05, and the corresponding p-values and 2-sided CIs 
for point estimates were reported, unless specified otherwise. 
In general, descriptive statistics were provided and statistical tests were applied if appropriate. For 
continuous variables, least squares (LS) means with corresponding standard errors (SEs) for each 
treatment group, along with LS mean of treatment difference (luspatercept versus placebo) with 
corresponding 95% CI and p-value were presented for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). 
Counts and percentages were used to describe categorical variables, and the treatment comparisons were 
analysed analogous to the primary endpoints using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) model stratified 
by baseline Hb category and baseline NTDT-PRO T/W domain score category (randomization stratification 
factors). The odds ratio (OR; luspatercept versus placebo) with corresponding 2-sided (at 0.05 α-level) 
95% CI and p-value were provided. The difference in proportions (luspatercept – placebo) and 95% CI 
were calculated. A forest plot showing the ORs, 95% CIs, and p-values for the overall result and the 
results in each subgroup was constructed for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. For all 
endpoints mentioned in this section, records beyond Week 48 were not used unless otherwise specified. If 
ANCOVA was used, the statistical assumption was validated first, and logarithmic transformations were 
applied as needed. 
To control the overall Type 1 error rate for the 3 key secondary efficacy endpoints, the testing procedure 
was implemented strictly in order: the test for key secondary efficacy endpoint 1 was only conducted if 
there was evidence showing that erythroid response was achieved in the luspatercept treatment group 
from Week 13 to Week 24 (primary efficacy endpoint). The key secondary efficacy endpoint 2 was to be 
tested only if the test results for both the primary efficacy endpoint and key secondary efficacy endpoint 
1 were significant. The key secondary efficacy endpoint 3 was to be tested only if the test results for the 
primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints 1 and 2 were all significant.  
The ongoing pivotal Phase 2 study (Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002) is using a 14 Sep 2020 data cut- off 
date for the primary analysis of efficacy and safety data. Updated data from a new cut-off date (15 Mar 
2021) were additionally provided. This included the results from additional post-hoc analyses showing 
longer follow up of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and serum ferritin data (using a 15 Mar 2021 data 
cut-off date instead of 14 Sep 2020), as well as the results from the prespecified exploratory endpoint of 
the non transfusion-dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia severity score. Data from subjects initially 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 91/245 
 
 
 
randomized to luspatercept included all data up to the data cut-off date of 15 Mar 2021, whereas data 
from subjects initially randomized to placebo included data only up to the crossover to luspatercept 
treatment (ie, only while the subjects were receiving placebo). Therefore, as of the 15 Mar 2021 data cut-
off date, the median treatment duration was longer in the luspatercept treatment group compared with 
the placebo treatment group. 
Generation/Validation of the NTDT-PRO tool 
Choice of PRO 
The NTDT-PRO was developed to assess the key symptoms relevant to patients with NTDT. Although 
generic health-status measures had been used with β-thalassemia patients (e.g., Medical Outcomes 
Study 36-Item Short Form Version 2 [SF-36v2®]), it was determined that the generic health measures 
were not fit-for-purpose (i.e., the level of validation associated with the existing tools was not sufficient 
to support their use amongst NTDT patients).  
Content Validity 
The Sponsors initially hypothesized a conceptual framework to support the measurement drafting 
domains and items to be measured based on literature review and expert opinion. Subsequently, 
conceptual interviews, interview discussions, cognitive interviews and clinical input ensured 
understanding and completeness of the concepts contained in the items. 
Final NTDT-PRO questionnaire 
The resulting item pool was combined to the final version of the NTDT-PRO that comprises a six-item 
questionnaire tallied to create a T/W score and a Shortness of Breath (SoB) score. The T/W score is an 
average of responses from four items that assess β-thalassemia related tiredness at rest and upon 
physical activity and weakness at rest and upon physical activity. To answer the items a 11-point numeric 
response scale ranging from 0 (“No”) to 10 (“Extreme”) was provided. 
The 6 items are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Tiredness (lack of energy) when not doing physical activity (TiredNA) 
Tiredness (lack of energy) when doing physical activity (TiredPA) 
Weakness (lack of strength) when not doing physical activity (WeakNA) 
Weakness (lack of strength) when doing physical activity (WeakPA) 
Shortness of breath (SoB) when not doing physical activity (SobNA) 
Shortness of breath when doing physical activity (SobPA) 
It was designed as a daily electronic diary (eDiary) with recall of thalassemia-related symptoms during 
the past 24 hours to accommodate the high degree of day-to
day variation in NTDT symptoms.  
Item scores were summarized as the average over 7-day periods. If entries were missing for ≥ 4 days in 
‐
any week, the average weekly score was declared as missing. Otherwise the mean of the non-missing 
values was taken. For the subjects with missing average interval scores at Week 13-24 or Week 37-48 
during the ACE-536-B-THAL-002 clinical trial, the 4-day rule of weekly NTDT-PRO T/W scores was relaxed 
to include all available daily scores, including those weeks with only one daily score available. The 4-day 
rule for deriving weekly item scores, however, was not relaxed for this psychometric analysis. 
No item-wise missing data were expected for the eDiary, because of the application logic. Items were 
grouped according to the following 2 domains, defined a priori:i) tiredness/weakness (T/W; TiredNA, 
TiredPA, WeakNA, WeakPA) and ii) SoB (SobNA, SobPA). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 92/245 
 
 
 
For each domain, scores were calculated as the average of the scores of items in the domain. The 
average of non-missing weekly item scores for each domain will be calculated if ≥50% of the items are 
not missing (i.e., ≥2 items for the T/W and ≥1 items for the SoB domain) and regarding T/W domain at 
least one weekly item score for tiredness (i.e., TiredNA or TiredPA) and one weekly item score for 
weakness (i.e., WeakNA or WeakPA) are not missing; otherwise, the weekly T/W or SoB score will be set 
to missing. 
Validation of NTDT-PRO 
The measurement properties of NTDT-PRO were evaluated in the observational study ACE-536-B-THAL-
003. 
This was a multisite, prospective, observational study implemented in β-thalassemia treatment centers 
from 4 countries (Italy, Greece, Lebanon, and Thailand).  
The primary objective of this study was to document the burden of illness (defined as impairment of 
HRQoL and impact on HRU) in subjects with β-thalassemia who were TD or NTD and receiving SoC. 
Secondary objectives included the preliminary evaluation of the psychometric properties of the newly 
developed NTDT-PRO, documentation of the baseline and longitudinal variance in HRQoL across subjects 
with β-thalassemia who were TD or NTD, and documentation of baseline and longitudinal HRU in subjects 
with β-thalassemia who were TD or NTD.  
In addition, an exploratory objective was to measure physical activity levels in subjects with β-
thalassemia who were TD or NTD, recorded using commercial Fitbit devices, and to correlate the physical 
activities with PROs/HRQoL and timing of transfusions. 
The included population of NTDT patients met the key inclusion/ exclusion criteria of the pivotal study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
Subjects participating in this observational study had the opportunity to be considered for the ongoing 
Phase 3 (ACE-536-B-THAL-001) or Phase 2 (ACE-536-B-THAL-002) β-thalassemia interventional studies 
being conducted in subjects with β-thalassemia who are TD or NTD, respectively. Additionally, key 
eligibility criteria for the observational study were similar to criteria for the Phase 3 (ACE-536-B-THAL-
001) and Phase 2 (ACE-536-B-THAL-002) studies. 
Disposition of Subjects: One hundred subjects (n = 50 with TD β-thalassemia [50.0%]; n = 50 with NTD 
β-thalassemia [50.0%]) were eligible and participated in the study between March 2016 and December 
2016. Daily NTDT-PRO assessments were performed solely by NTD β-thalassemia patients. Further QoL 
assessments were performed as follows: SF-36, FACT-An, and the Patient Global Impression of Change 
(PGI C) scale every 3 weeks. NTDT-PRO was completed every day before bedtime. In addition each 
patient was provided with a wrist-wearable electronic device (Fitbit) in order to record the subjects 
continuous activity during both day and night. 
The demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were generally reflective of the target subject 
populations. NTDT patients had a median age of 34 years (range 18, 52), 68% were female, 78% were 
white, education was balanced with 50% university/college degree and 50% other. The recruitment 
countries were well balanced with 22.0% of evaluable subjects were from Greece, 30.0% from Italy, 
26.0% from Lebanon, and 22.0% from Thailand. The median Hb level was 8.0 g/dL (range 6.0, 10.1), the 
time of initial diagnosis was 21.5 years (range 0.0, 43.0), 84% had active comorbidities with a median of 
2.5 comorbidities (range 1.0, 6.0), 44% had a prior splenectomy, 14% had RBC transfusions within the 
last 24 weeks, the median of the most recent LIC was 4.0 mg Fe/g dw (range 2.5, 13.00) and 24% 
received currently an ICT.

Assessment of Psychometric Properties of the NTDT-PRO 
For the preliminary evaluation of the psychometric properties of the NTDT-PRO several analyses were 
performed to evaluate Construct Validity (Exploratory Factor Analysis, Convergent and Discriminant 
Validity, Known-group Validity – Sensitivity, and Predictive Validity) and Reliability (Repeatability/Test-
Retest Reliability and Internal Consistency). 
Reliability 
The repeatability of the NTDT-PRO T/W and SoB domain scores were assessed by comparing NTDT-PRO 
domain scores in subjects who reported no change on the PGIC over 3-week intervals (Week 1 to 3, 9 to 
12, and 21 to 24) via the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC ranged from 0.80 to 1.00 for 
the T/W domain and from 0.82 to 0.99 for the SoB domain and were therefore above the threshold 
considered acceptable (0.7). 
In order to assess the degree of internal consistency within each NTDT-domain Cronbach’s alpha was 
used. The α coefficients were presented both before (i.e., raw or unstandardized) and after 
standardization of variances. Standardized α coefficients between 0.70 and 0.90 were regarded as 
acceptable internal consistency, with α ≥ 0.90 demonstrating redundancy. For the T/W domain, the 
overall standardized α was 0.93, indicating that the items were internally consistent, however, results 
also indicated that some redundancy may be present in the items comprising the T/W domain. For the 
SoB domain, correlations of the 2 items with the domain score were moderately high, and the overall 
standardized α was 0.77, indicating good internal consistency among the 2 items. 
Construct validity 
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in order to identify the number and nature of latent 
variables (i.e., factors) that are being measured by the NTDT-PRO instrument. Firstly, the Kaiser-Meyer-
Olkin (KMO) measure was conducted to assess the suitability of the data for EFA. An index >0.5 
considered adequate for EFA, which was met by all NTDT-PRO-items and overall. Secondly, Pearson’s and 
Spearman’s correlations were calculated to assess the patterns of inter-item correlations among the 
NTDT-PRO items. Nearly all items of the NTDT-PRO were acceptable highly correlated with each other 
(coefficients > .5), with the exception of Item 2 and Item 5, and Item 4 and Item 5 (Spearman 
coefficients of 0.40 and 0.46, respectively). Correlations between Item 1 and Item 6; and Item 3 and 
Item 6 were considered high, but slightly lower compared with other items (0.51 and 0.59, respectively). 
This is somewhat expected as Items 1 to 4 comprise the T/W domain, while Items 5 and 6 comprise the 
SoB domain. All other inter-item correlations were ≥ 0.60. 
The principle axis method was used to extract factors with items’ squared multiple correlations used as 
prior estimates of their communality. To choose the number of factors retained, the scree plot was 
inspected to identify a break in the data, and the percentage of common variance accounted for by a 
given factor was inspected (i.e. whether that factor accounted for at least approximately 5% of the 
common variance). The scree plot indicated a break between 2 and 3 factors and since 94% of the 
variance was explained by the first 2 factors a 2-factor model was selected.  
Based on those results, a Varimax (orthogonal) rotation and also a Proxmax (oblique) rotation was 
applied. Outputs from both rotations were reviewed in order of a resulting “simple structure” and whether 
items loading on the same factor sharing some conceptual meaning and when load on different factors 
measuring different constructs. Indeed, both the Varimax (orthogonal) and Promax (oblique) rotations 
explained similar proportions of variance and demonstrated similar factor loading patterns. The Promax 
rotation resulted in the items having slightly higher loadings on one factor and near-zero loadings on the 
other compared with the Varimax rotation; however, the 2 rotations result in the same interpretation. 
Items 1, 3, and 5 (those items inquiring about symptoms when not doing physical activity) had relatively

high loadings on Factor 1, whereas Items 2, 4, and 6 (those items inquiring about symptoms when doing 
physical activity) had relatively high loadings on Factor 2. 
NTDT-PRO domains were compared with the domains of other questionnaires SF-36 [physical component 
summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)], FACT-An, Hb level, OSS (measured by the 
NTDT-PRO Item 7) and the Fitbit measurements in order to assess convergent and discriminant 
validity.  
Both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values were estimated and 
summarized for assessing the strength of correlation between each NTDT-PRO domain (ie, T/W and SoB) 
and predefined measures. The hypotheses were that the NTDT-PRO T/W and SoB domains would 
generally have high correlation with the domains related to physical functioning and fatigue or anemia 
symptoms (e.g., PF and VT of the SF-36 and PWB and FS of the FACT-An), Hb level, OSS of the NTDT-
PRO, and outcomes from the Fitbit listed above, and low correlation with domains related to mental 
health (eg, MH and MCS of the SF-36).  
Strong correlations were found between OSS and T/W and SoB domains of the NTDT-PRO during all 
measurements (baseline, Week 12 and Week 24) as expected. For the domain-domain correlations 
between NTDT-PRO domain scores and each domain of the SF-36 and of the FACT-Ans, relatively 
stronger correlations were observed at Weeks 12 and 24 than at baseline. Both T/W and SoB domains 
were highly correlated across all 3 reported visits with the VT domain of the SF-36 (≥ 0.50 in absolute 
Spearman correlation; with the exception of baseline/enrollment for the SoB domain with a correlation of 
-0.41), which was consistent with the hypothesis. The PF domain, however, was moderately correlated 
with the T/W and SoB domains across all 3 reported visits (between 0.30 and 0.50 in absolute Spearman 
correlation; with the exception of baseline/enrollment for the SoB domain with a correlation of -0.24), 
inconsistent with the stated hypothesis. Moderate to high correlations were observed with MH and MCS 
domains of the SF-36 (with the exception of baseline/enrollment correlations, which were generally low), 
also inconsistent with the stated hypothesis. Regarding FACT-An domain scores T/W domain has 
relatively moderate to high correlation (absolute value) across all visits while SoB domain showed 
relatively weaker correlations (but still ≥ 0.50 in most cases) with FS, FS-Exp, and AnS domains. As 
hypothesized, correlations between the FACT-An FS and the NTDT-PRO domains and between the FACT-
An PWB and the NTDT-PRO domains were high at Weeks 12 and 24. Correlations between NTDT-PRO 
domain scores and each domain of the Fitbit demonstrated relatively little to no correlation across all 
Fitbit outcomes and all visits, which was not as expected per the hypotheses. Correlations between the 
NTDT-PRO domains and Hb levels were generally positive, in the opposite direction of what was expected. 
This may be due to the relatively few Hb levels available alongside the NTDT-PRO, the difference in timing 
between Hb measurement and NTDT-PRO administration, or the potential fluctuation of Hb levels within 
subjects. 
The sensitivity (known-group validity) of the NTDT-PRO was assessed by comparing mean scores (and 
95% CIs) of each NTDT-PRO domain per known group. Effect sizes for differences between OSS groups 
were very large and positive (> 1.0) for both domains of the NTDT-PRO. Effect sizes for the difference 
between the SF-36 groups (PF, VT, and PCS) ranged from moderate to very large and were consistently 
negative as expected, indicating adequate known-groups validity. Conversely, effect sizes were small 
(and sometimes in the opposite direction of what was expected) when classifying groups according to the 
number of comorbidities at baseline and categories of Fitbit activity (i.e., steps taken, floors climbed, 
calories burned, and percentage of time active in a week). In addition, when classifying subjects based on 
Hb level, effect sizes were in the opposite direction of what was expected. This is consistent with the 
findings of the convergent validity analyses.

Predictive validity of the NTDT-PRO was assessed by computing mean baseline T/W and SoB domain 
scores by subjects who experienced predefined HRU outcomes (i.e, any RBC transfusion, ER visits, 
inpatient hospitalization, outpatient visit, laboratory assessments, or procedures) throughout the study 
period. Additionally, both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between baseline NTDT-PRO T/W 
and SoB domain scores and the number of each of the above HRU items over the study period were 
computed. In general, differences between the groups were relatively small in most cases (< 1.0), and 
the number of HRU items utilized over follow-up did not demonstrate correlation with either NTDT-PRO 
domain (ranging from -0.22 to +0.27). Only when analyzing ER visits were the differences between 
groups larger than 1 (1.52 and 1.38 for the T/W and SoB domains, respectively); however, the 
differences were in the opposite direction than expected. 
In order to determine the MID (Minimally Important Difference) and RD (Responder Definition) for the 
NTDT-PRO both will be assessed for the T/W and SoB domain scores using anchor-based approaches and 
distribution-based approaches. 
For the anchor-based analysis, PGIC and the OSS were preselected as anchors (i.e. PGIC and change 
OSS score was classified as “improved” when 1,2, or 3, and ≤ -1; “no change” when 4 and > -1 and < 1; 
and “worsened” when 5,6, or 7, and ≥ 1, respectively). At Week 12, Week 24, and overall, change from 
baseline in both the T/W and SoB domain scores showed little to no correlation with the PGIC, indicating 
that the PGIC may potentially be a weak anchor for the NTDT-PRO. However, at Week 12, Week 24, and 
overall, change from baseline in both the T/W and SoB domain scores showed moderate to strong 
correlation with the NTDT-PRO OSS, indicating that the OSS may potentially be a strong anchor for the 
NTDT-PRO. Subsequently, both within- and between-group mean differences were calculated based on 
observed scores and a mixed-effect model. For both T/W and SoB domain anchored on PGIC, both within- 
and between-group effect sizes in improvement were < 0.20 in magnitude (regardless of the estimation 
method used). Both domains anchored on NTDT-PRO OSS change scores, at Week 24, both within- and 
between-group effect sizes in improvement were > 0.20 in magnitude (regardless of the estimation 
method used). Using one estimation model (observed mean change) T/W and SoB domain (regardless of 
the anchor) showed in both effect sizes in worsened/deterioration > 0.40. 
A distribution-based analysis was conducted using the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the 
SD of the domain score at baseline. Meaningful changes ranged between 0.82 to 0.33 (SD based) and 
0.69 (SEM) for the T/W domain and 0.79 to 0.32 (SD) based and 0.64 (SEM) for the SoB.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 160 subjects were screened for inclusion in the study and 15 subjects (approximately 9.4% of 
those screened) failed screening. The most frequently reported (in at least 2 subjects) reasons for screen 
failures were based on not meeting Inclusion Criterion 7 (mean baseline Hb level of ≤ 10.0 g/dL; 7 of 160 
screened subjects) and Inclusion Criterion 3 (ability to adhere to visit schedule and not planned for HSCT; 
3 of 160 screened subjects). One screening failure was due to diagnosis of thalassaemia (incl. crit. No 
04), presence of laboratory abnormalities (excl. crit. No. 02), diagnosis of HbS/β-thalassemia or α-
thalassemia (excl. crit. No. 04), pregnancy/lactating (excl. crit. No. 13), major organ damage (lund 
disease; excl. crit. No. 15c), history or current malignancies (excl. crit. No. 20).  
A total of 145 subjects were randomized to study treatment at 12 sites in 6 countries (Table 31).

As of the second data cutoff date (15 Mar 2021), the median treatment duration was longer in the 
luspatercept treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (124.8 versus 61.1 weeks)  
Table 32 : Summary of Extent of Exposure (ITT population) 
As of the second cut-off date (22-Sep-2021), subject disposition was presented separately for the 
‘symptomatic’ and the ITT population. The majority of symptomatic subjects randomized to luspatercept 
(83.3%) were continuing to receive treatment as of the updated data cut of 22-Sep-2021 (Table 3), with 
a median duration of treatment of 145 weeks (data not shown). In addition, 27 of 35 placebo-treated 
symptomatic subjects (77.1%) crossed over to receive luspatercept treatment after completing the 
double-blind treatment period, 25 of whom were continuing to receive luspatercept treatment as of the 
data cut-off date.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
The original protocol (12 May 2017) was amended 2 times. Key changes made to the protocol are listed 
below.  
Protocol Amendment 1 (21 Dec 2018) 
- Dose delay for worsening of anemia (Decrease of > 2g/dL Hb from baseline Hb (uninfluenced by 
transfusion) or subject becomes regularly transfused in combination with an unexplained shift from 
baseline (worsening) of ≥ 2 grades leukopenia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia); discontinuation of 
study drug if hematologic malignancy was confirmed. 
- Dose delay for Grade ≥ 3 leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia; discontinuation of study 
drug if hematologic malignancy was confirmed. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (12 Jun 2020) 
- Baseline Hb was re-defined as the average of 2 or more Hb measurements at least 1 week apart within 
4 weeks before Dose 1 instead of before randomisation. 
- The addition of the Open Label Study after study unblinding was to allow subjects treated with 
placebo during the DBTP to cross over to luspatercept treatment and to allow subjects who were still 
benefiting from treatment with luspatercept to continue this treatment for up to 15 months before 
moving to the rollover study (ACE536-LTFU-001). 
- NTDT-PRO QoL analysis - Section 1.3.2.1 Rationale for Secondary Endpoint and Section 9.6.3.5. 
(Definition of NTDTPRO Minimum Clinical Important Difference (MCID) and Responder Definition (RD) 
Thresholds) have been modified to reflect some literature findings as well as the approach that will be 
implemented to analyze the blinded Quality of Life (QoL) data to determine the MCID. Moreover, Study 
Assessment report

Endpoints has been modified to replace the NTDT-PRO total score with the NTDT-PRO Shortness of Breath 
(SoB) partial score (as secondary endpoint). 
The NTDT-PRO analyses were modified to remove mention of a comparison between Hb levels and NTDT-
PRO based on literature demonstrating that no linear association was expected between Hb and self-
reported fatigue or HRQoL, and that the maximum incremental improvement in HRQoL could be expected 
at an Hb level of 11.0 to 13.0 g/dL (Shasha, 2004; Crawford, 2002). 
- The PGI-S was added to the multiple-anchor approach for the analysis as the preferable anchor point 
that would directly reflect subjects’ perceived severity of symptoms. The PGI-S was already being 
administered along with the NTDT-PRO but was explicitly added as an assessment in the amended 
protocol. 
- The NTDT-PRO total score was replaced with the NTDT-PRO SoB domain score in the secondary efficacy 
endpoints because the total score calculation/algorithm had not been fully developed for the instrument. 
- To be consistent with the dosing recommendations in the approved product label, the maximum total 
dose per administration was removed from the study drug administration guidelines. 
- Thromboembolic events were added as targeted safety events. 
- The 3 key secondary efficacy endpoints and the sequential testing procedure were specified. 
- Analysis of the proportion of subjects with an increase from baseline of ≥ 3 in mean FACIT-F score over 
a continuous 12-week interval from Week 13 to Week 24 and from Week 37 to Week 48 was specified as 
being for the fatigue subscale only. 
- Analysis of change from baseline in the SF-36 at Week 24 and Week 48 was specified as being for the 
PCS and MCS. 
- Analysis of the proportion of subjects with a decrease from baseline ≥ RD in mean NTDT-PRO T/W 
domain score over Week 13 to Week 24 and from Week 37 to Week 48 was clarified to be a planned 
endpoint (it had been previously only mentioned in the text). 
- The HRQoL evaluable populations were defined and more information was added about HRQoL 
instruments. 
- The planned analyses were clarified with specification that the primary efficacy analysis would occur 
after all subjects had completed 48 weeks of treatment in the DBTP or discontinued earlier and that 
updated safety and efficacy analyses would be performed at the end of the OLP. 
Protocol deviations 
Treatment compliance by subjects was not measured because all study drug administration was 
performed by site personnel at the clinical site. All study drug administration data were recorded in the 
eCRFs, which, along with study drug accountability records and other relevant source documents, were 
reviewed regularly. 
Dosing errors were recorded as important protocol deviations under the category of “IP issues” and were 
reported in 5 (5.2%) subjects in the luspatercept treatment group and 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo 
treatment group (Table 34). Dose delays for reasons other than the protocol-specified criteria occurred 
occasionally due to subject circumstances and due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table 34: Summary of Protocol Deviations and Important Protocol Deviations (ITT Population) 
Dose changes 
Doses administered including reductions, increases and delays were only summarised in the safety 
section.  
A short summary is given here:  
Dose delays: 83.3% in the luspatercept treatment group and 55.1% in the placebo treatment group had 
their dose delayed at least once during the study.  
Between-group imbalance in dose delays was mainly because of Hb ≥ 11.5 g/dL, which was reported for 
34 (35.4%) subjects in the luspatercept treatment group compared with 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo 
treatment group. The median time to first dose delay due to Hb ≥ 11.5 g/dL was 79.0 days (range: 29.0 
to 755.0 days) in the luspatercept treatment group. The time to first dose delay due to Hb ≥ 11.5 g/dL in 
the placebo-treated subject was 244.0 days. 
Dose delays due to treatment-related Grade ≥ 2 TEAEs occurred only in the luspatercept treatment group 
(7 [7.3%] subjects). The median time to first dose delay due to an AE was 283.0 days in the luspatercept 
treatment group and 387.0 days in the placebo treatment group. 
Dose reduction: Dose reduction from 1.00 mg/kg to 0.80 mg/kg occurred for 19 (19.8%) subjects in the 
luspatercept treatment group and 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo treatment group. A second dose 
reduction from 0.80 mg/kg to 0.60 mg/kg occurred for 3 (3.1%) subjects in the luspatercept treatment 
group; no such dose reduction occurred in the placebo treatment group. No further dose reductions (0.60 
mg/kg to 0.45 mg/kg) were reported. 
76 (79.2) and 47 (95.9) of luspatercept and placebo subjects, respectively, had their dose not reduced.  
20.8% in the luspatercept treatment group and 4.1% in the placebo treatment group had their study 
drug dose reduced at least once during the study. These included dose reductions from the starting dose 
of 1.00 mg/kg and dose reductions back to 1.00 mg/kg after titration to 1.25 mg/kg.  
Four subjects (all in the luspatercept treatment group) had their study drug dose reduced twice during 
the study. 
The median time to first dose reduction was 50.0 days (range: 21.0 to 771.0 days) in the luspatercept 
treatment group and 335.0 days (range: 48.0 to 622.0 days) in the placebo treatment group.

The most frequently reported (in > 5.0% of subjects) reasons for dose reduction were increase in Hb of > 
2.0 g/dL (10.4% vs. 4.1% for luspatercept and placebo, respectively) and treatment-related Grade ≥ 3 
TEAEs (8.3% 0% for luspatercept and placebo, respectively).

Prior medications 
The use of prior medications was generally similar (difference of ≤ 5.0% of subjects) between the 
treatment groups. Of note, a higher proportion of subjects (difference of > 5.0% of subjects) in the 
luspatercept treatment group than those in the placebo treatment group used paracetamol (9.4% versus 
4.1%, respectively), vitamins not otherwise specified (7.3% versus 0%, respectively), and folic acid and 
ursodeoxycholic acid (5.2% versus 0% each, respectively). Fewer subjects in the luspatercept treatment 
group than in the placebo treatment group (difference of > 5.0% of subjects) used acetylsalicylic acid 
(20.8% versus 30.6%, respectively) and ketoprofen and bisoprolol (1.0% versus 6.1% each, 
respectively). 
Prior medication usage was generally consistent with reported NTDT comorbidities and medical history in 
the study population.

Other Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications used by at least 5.0% of total subjects are summarized by preferred name in 
Table 46. 
All subjects (100.0%) received at least 1 concomitant medication. The ATC4 classes from which 
concomitant medications were most frequently used (in > 20.0% of total subjects) were Anilides 
(66.2%); Vitamin D and Analogues (55.2%); Propionic Acid Derivatives (37.9%); Influenza Vaccines 
(30.3%); Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors, excluding Heparin (27.6%); Combinations of Penicillins, 
including β-lactamase Inhibitors (26.2%); Calcium (24.8%); and Proton Pump Inhibitors (20.0%). By 
preferred name, the most frequently reported concomitant medications (in > 20.0% of total subjects) 
were paracetamol (64.1%); colecalciferol (30.3%); acetylsalicylic acid (27.6%); influenza vaccine and 
amoxicillin sodium/clavulanate potassium (26.2% each); ibuprofen (25.5%); and calcium carbonate 
(23.4%) (Table 46).  
The use of concomitant medications was generally similar (difference of ≤ 10.0% of subjects) between the 
treatment groups. Of note, a greater proportion of subjects (difference of > 10.0% of subjects) in the 
luspatercept treatment group than those in the placebo treatment group used paracetamol (71.9% 
versus 49.0%, respectively), influenza vaccine (30.2% versus 18.4%, respectively), ibuprofen (29.2% 
versus 18.4%, respectively), and amoxicillin and ketoprofen (16.7% versus 6.1% each, respectively). 
Some of these differences are related to the difference between the treatment groups in overall duration 
of treatment, in particular for use of influenza vaccine. Use of concomitant chlorphenamine (20.4% 
versus 7.3%, respectively) and acetylsalicylic acid (34.7% versus 24.0%, respectively) was more 
frequent (difference of > 10.0% of subjects) in the placebo treatment group than in the luspatercept 
treatment group (Table 46). These differences may have been related to a higher incidence of  
transfusions (with premedication) among subjects in the placebo treatment group.

71.9% [full study]), colecalciferol (25.0% versus 31.3%), amoxicillin sodium-clavulanate potassium 
(20.8% versus 27.1%), and influenza vaccine (17.7% versus 30.2%).

Details of antibiotic therapy for all subjects by treatment arm including reasons for therapy have been 
provided. Only 2 subjects in the luspatercept arm had concomitant antibiotic use due to splenectomy and 
one subject in the placebo arm had antibiotic therapy given as prophylaxis for bacterial infection, 
indicating that prophylactic use was not one of the major reasons for antibiotic therapy. All other 
antibiotic use was for the treatment of adverse events of infection. As such, it can be concluded that the 
use of antibiotic treatment did not affect the need for transfusions.

Table 51: Mean change in Haemglobin (g/dL) from baseline over a continuous 12 week 
interval from week 13 to week 24 (ITT population) 
To enable longitudinal analysis of trends over time using all available Hb data, an MMRM analysis was 
conducted with intercept and time as the random effect to evaluate the Hb change from baseline at 
Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. The analysis demonstrated that the LS mean changes from baseline in each 
treatment group and the LS mean differences between the treatment groups at these time points were 
similar to the change observed for the Week 13 to Week 24 interval and were consistent over time.

•  Change From Baseline in the NTDT-PRO T/W Domain Score to Week 37 to Week 48 
The LS mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group 
was -0.79 (95% CI: -1.58, 0.00). This treatment difference favoured luspatercept over placebo 
but was not nominally significant (nominal p = 0.0510).

and treatment group (HRQoL evaluable population) 
•  Proportion of Subjects With a Decrease From Baseline ≥ RD (= 1) in the Mean NTDT-
PRO T/W Domain Score 
The RD for the NTDT-PRO T/W domain score was defined as ≥ 1-point decrease (ie, RD = -1) from 
baseline over the time from Week 13 to Week 24. 
The proportion of subjects with a decrease in the NTDT-PRO T/W domain score that was at least as 
large as the RD over Week 13 to Week 24 was 37.5% and 28.6% in the luspatercept (n=36) and 
placebo (n=14) treatment groups, respectively (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 0.8, 3.7; nominal p = 0.1989) 
(CSR Table 30 for the ITT population, data not shown). 
The proportion of subjects with a decrease in the NTDT-PRO T/W domain score that was at least as 
large as the RD over Week 37 to Week 48 was 31.3% and 18.4% in the luspatercept (30) and

NTDT PRO SoB   
Week 13-24 (ITT; n= 94 and n=48): The LS mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus 
the placebo treatment group was -0.49 (95% CI: -1.02, 0.04). This treatment difference favoured 
luspatercept over placebo but was not nominally significant (nominal p = 0.0721). 
Week 37-48 (ITT, n=72 and n=28): The LS mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus 
the placebo treatment group was -1.07 (95% CI: -1.80, -0.33) and this treatment difference was 
nominally significant (nominal p = 0.0047), favouring luspatercept over placebo.  
FACIT-F 
The FACIT-F is a multidimensional, self-reported HRQoL instrument consisting of 27 core items that 
include the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General questionnaire (assessing 4 functional 
domains: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being) supplemented by a 13-item 
measure designed to capture cancer-related fatigue, the Fatigue subscale. Analyses for FACIT-F Fatigue 
subscale scores were performed for the HRQoL evaluable population unless otherwise indicated. The 
FACIT-F Fatigue subscale is scored such that higher score reflects less fatigue and better QoL (score 
range 0-52; with 0 being the worst possible score and 52 being the best possible score indicating no 
fatigue). 
A subject was considered compliant for the FACIT-F at a visit if at least 32 out of the 40 items in the 
questionnaire were answered. When calculated using the total number of subjects in the ITT population 
as the denominators, the compliance quotients at baseline were 100.0% and 98.0% in the luspatercept 
and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The rates remained relatively high (≥ 78.1% and ≥ 77.6% in 
the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively) during the first 24 weeks but decreased to 
75.0% and 65.3% at Week 48, respectively. The analyses were based on the HRQoL Evaluable 
Population. 
Week 13-24 (n=90 and n=43): The LS mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus the 
placebo treatment group was 1.39 (95% CI: -1.06, 3.83). This treatment difference favoured 
luspatercept over placebo but was not nominally significant (nominal p = 0.2641). 
Week 37-48 (n=83 and n=33): The LS mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus the 
placebo treatment group was 2.19 (95% CI: -0.39, 4.78). This treatment difference favoured 
luspatercept over placebo but was not nominally significant (nominal p = 0.0959). 
SF-36  
The SF-36 is a 36-item generic self-administered PRO questionnaire used to assess patient-reported 
HRQoL outcomes. The SF-36 yields scores for 8 domains of health: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, 
Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health as well as 
physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. The SF-36 
is scored such that higher scores reflect a better health state. For this study, a 7-day recall period was 
used.  
A subject was considered compliant for the SF-36 at a visit if at least 18 out of the 36 items in the 
questionnaire were answered. When calculated using the total number of subjects in the ITT population 
as the denominators, the compliance quotients at baseline were 97.9% and 95.9% in the luspatercept 
and placebo treatment groups, respectively. The rates remained relatively high (≥ 78.1% and ≥ 75.5% in 
the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively) during the first 24 weeks, decreasing to 
75.0% and 65.3% at Week 48.

The raw score for each health domain can be transformed into a 0–100 scale score. This scale can be 
converted to norm-based scores using a T-score transformation, with a mean of 50 and a standard 
deviation (SD) of 10. This allows one health domain scale to be meaningfully compared with the other 
scales, and for domain scores to have a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of scores in the 
US general population. Higher norm-based T-scores indicate better health/QoL, based on data from a 
nationally representative sample of US adults. 
Table 58 (excerpt): Composition and Interpretation of T-Scores for the Acute Form of the SF-
36 (Version 2) Component Summary Measures and Health Domain Scales 
Based on the HRQoL evaluable population, the mean (SD) change from baseline in the SF-36 PCS at 
Week 24 was 0.85 (7.149) and -1.18 (5.503) in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively. At Week 48, the mean (SD) change from baseline was 1.03 (5.277) and 0.48 (5.367) in the 
luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively. 
The mean (SD) change from baseline in the SF-36 MCS at Week 24 was 0.98 (8.816) in the 
luspatercept treatment group and -0.76 (6.901) in the placebo treatment group, respectively. At Week 
48, the mean (SD) change from baseline was 0.98 (7.882) and -2.53 (6.538) in the luspatercept and 
placebo treatment groups, respectively.

6MWT 
Subjects were asked to walk as quickly as possible, without running, along a 30-meter corridor for 6 
minutes. The average 6MWT distance for healthy adults aged 20 to 50 years is 593 ± 57 m for women 
and 638 ± 44 m for men (Chetta, 2006). The mean baseline distances were 446.97 m and 434.98 m in 
the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively. 
At Week 24 (n=87 and n=47 for luspatercept and placebo, respectively), the LS mean (SE) change from 
baseline in the mean 6MWT distance covered was 7.20 (7.017) m in the luspatercept treatment group 
and -8.96 (9.297) m in the placebo treatment group. The LS mean difference at Week 24 for the 
luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was 16.15 (95% CI: -5.73, 38.04). 
This difference between the treatment groups was not nominally significant (nominal p = 0.1466). 
At Week 48 (n=86 and n=41 for luspatercept and placebo, respectively), the LS mean (SE) change from 
baseline in the mean 6MWT distance covered was 8.82 (5.907) m in the luspatercept treatment group 
and -3.62 (8.141) m in the placebo treatment group. The LS mean difference at Week 48 for the 
luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was 12.44 (95% CI: -6.72, 31.59). 
This difference between the treatment groups was not nominally significant (nominal p = 0.2011). 
Iron parameters 
Iron overload (assessed based on LIC determined using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], daily ICT 
dose, and serum ferritin measurements). 
•  Mean change in derived LIC from baseline at Week 24 and Week 48 
Treatment with luspatercept did not result in significant reduction in LIC over the 48-week DBTP.  
At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) change in derived LIC from baseline was -0.40 (0.137) mg/g dw in the 
luspatercept treatment group and -0.28 (0.175) mg/g dw in the placebo treatment group. The LS mean 
difference at Week 24 for the luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was -
0.12 (95% CI: -0.52, 0.28). This difference between the treatment groups was not nominally 
significant (nominal p = 0.5547). 
At Week 48, the LS mean (SE) change in derived LIC from baseline was -0.46 (0.265) mg/g dw in the 
luspatercept treatment group and -1.13 (0.355) mg/g dw in the placebo treatment group. The LS mean 
difference at Week 48 for the luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was 
0.66 (95% CI:  -0.15, 1.47). This difference between the treatment groups was not nominally 
significant (nominal p = 0.1071). 
•  Number of LIC/ICT responders (subjects who achieved ≥ 20% reduction in LIC or ≥ 
33% decrease in ICT daily dose from baseline) at Week 24 and Week 48 
At Week 24, 44.8% and 49.0% of subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively, were LIC/ICT responders (nominal p = 0.4787), whereas at Week 48, 34.4% and 49.0% of 
subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively, were LIC/ICT responders 
(nominal p = 0.0827). Thus, at both Week 24 and Week 48, the proportions of LIC/ICT 
responders were numerically but not nominally significantly greater in the placebo treatment 
group than in the luspatercept treatment group. This may possibly be due to a greater proportion of 
placebo-treated subjects receiving concomitant deferasirox compared with the luspatercept-treated 
subjects (30.6% versus 24.0%, respectively). Deferasirox is the only approved ICT in NTDT patients and 
has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing LIC and serum ferritin in this patient population.

•  Serum Ferritin 
At Week 24, the LS mean (SE) change in mean serum ferritin level from baseline was 29.32 (22.949) 
μg/L in the luspatercept treatment group and 2.18 (32.217) μg/L in the placebo treatment group. The LS 
mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was 27.14 
(95% CI: -46.77, 101.06) and this treatment difference was not nominally significant (nominal p = 
0.5865). 
At Week 48, the LS mean (SE) change in mean serum ferritin level from baseline was 84.98 (23.117) 
μg/L in the luspatercept treatment group and 71.48 (32.453) μg/L in the placebo treatment group. The 
LS mean difference for the luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was 
13.50 (95% CI: -60.96, 87.96) and this treatment difference was not nominally significant (nominal p 
= 0.3504). 
Co-morbidities 
•  Extramedullary hematopoietic mass (EMH) volume  
MRI for assessment of extramedullary hemopoietic masses was done at screening only if subjects were 
already diagnosed with this condition. Because there was no systematic screening for extramedullary 
hemopoietic masses at baseline, there is a high risk of underdiagnosis at baseline. Only 11 subjects 
provided baseline data for EMH masses. The mean (median) EMH mass (located in the vertebra region) 
volume was 30.17 (13.80) cm3 among 11 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group and 73.41 (4.91) 
cm3 among 11 subjects in the placebo treatment group. 
The mean EMH volume increased from baseline in the luspatercept group ((30.97 cm3 [10 subjects]), 
while it decreased in the placebo group (–30.42 cm3 [9 subjects]) at week 48. The mean volumes at 
Week 48 were similar (60.36 cm3 [13 subjects] and 58.81 cm3 [9 subjects] in the luspatercept and 
placebo treatment groups, respectively). 
•  Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation Velocity 
Change in TRV serves as an indicator of potential pulmonary hypertension. A TRV of ≤ 2.8 m/sec 
(indicates a low probability of pulmonary hypertension) was reported at baseline in 77.1% and 75.5% of 
subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Postbaseline, 84.4% and 79.6% 
of subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively, had TRV of ≤ 2.8 m/sec. A 
TRV of > 3.4 m/sec (indicates a high probability of pulmonary hypertension) was reported at baseline for 
1 subject in the luspatercept treatment group; no TRV values of > 3.4 m/sec were reported postbaseline 
in either treatment group. In general, no deterioration was observed in TRV in the 2 treatment groups 
postbaseline. 
•  Spleen volume 
Change from baseline in spleen volume (measured by MRI) at Week 24 and Week 48 was assessed as an 
exploratory efficacy endpoint in the study for subjects without prior splenectomy. 
A total of 64.6% and 46.9%) of subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively, 
were not splenectomised at baseline. 60 and 22 subjects for luspatercept and placebo, respectively, 
provided baseline data. The mean baseline spleen volume was 958.95 cm3 and 1113.42 cm3 in the 
luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Decrease in spleen volume was numerically but 
not nominally significantly greater at Week 24 and Week 48 in the luspatercept treatment group 
compared with the placebo treatment group. This was expected given the relatively short period of 
treatment and observation in the DBTP.

•  Bone Mineral Density 
World Health Organization guidance was followed to assess the osteopenic or osteoporotic status of each 
subject and ensured consistent reporting across study sites. Any T-score reported as > -1.0 and < -2.5 
was to be attributed to osteopenia and any T-score reported as ≥ -2.5 was to be assessed as 
osteoporosis. These 2 diagnoses were mutually exclusive and the worst diagnosis based on T-score was 
the one to be reported (Cappellini, 2014b; WHO, 2004; WHO, 1994). 
T-scores were essentially stable during the 48-week DBTP. At Week 48, the LS mean (SE) change from 
baseline in total hip T-score was 0.07 (0.039) in the luspatercept treatment group and -0.05 (0.052) in 
the placebo treatment group. The LS mean difference at Week 48 for the luspatercept treatment group 
versus the placebo treatment group was 0.12 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.25). In addition, the LS mean (SE) 
change from baseline in spine T-score was -0.06 (0.421) in the luspatercept treatment group and -0.03 
(0.298) in the placebo treatment group. The LS mean difference at Week 48 for the luspatercept 
treatment group versus the placebo treatment group was -0.02 (95% CI: 
-0.17, 0.12). BMD monitoring tends to occur at least every 2 years, so substantial change was not likely 
to occur during this time. 
During the DBTP by Week 48, comorbidity of osteoporosis (not present at baseline) was reported in 3 
(3.1%) subjects in the luspatercept treatment group and 1 (2.0%) subject in the placebo treatment 
group. By Week 48, comorbid osteopenia was reported in 2 luspatercept-treated subjects (1 subject with 
osteoporosis diagnosed at baseline) and 1 placebo-treated subject.  
Concomitant use of denosumab was reported in 4 (4.2%) and 2 (4.1%) subjects in the luspatercept and 
placebo treatment groups, respectively. Concomitant use of collagen-hydroxyapatite-complex was 
reported for 2 (2.1%) and 4 (8.2%) subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively. Concomitant use of bisphosphonates was reported for 3 (3.1%) and 5 (10.2%) subjects in 
the luspatercept and placebo treatment groups, respectively.

Hemoglobin  
For the primary and second key secondary efficacy endpoint, a treatment effect (significantly and/or 
numerically greater) in favour of the luspatercept treatment group versus the placebo treatment group 
was observed in majority of the subgroups examined (figures 30 and 31).

Post-hoc analyses 
Subjects Requiring Transfusions Postbaseline 
As of the (first) data cut-off date, 15 (15.6%) subjects in the luspatercept treatment group underwent a 
total of 49 RBC transfusion events postbaseline accounting for 75.33 RBC units and 21 (42.9%) 
subjects in the placebo treatment group underwent a total of 78 RBC transfusion events postbaseline 
accounting for 122.03 RBC units. One to 3 packed RBC units were transfused at each transfusion. 
The most frequently reported reason for a postbaseline transfusion in the luspatercept treatment group 
was anaemia. Of note, approximately half the transfusions with reason “anaemia” were administered 
while no significant Hb level decreases were observed (ie, < –0.5 g/dL from baseline). Other reasons for 
postbaseline transfusions were surgery (1 luspatercept-treated subject with 1 RBC unit versus 3

RBC units versus 1 placebo-treated subject with 3 RBC units), infection (1 placebo-treated 
subject with 4 RBC units), and AE (4 luspatercept-treated subjects with 12 RBC units versus 3 
placebo-treated subjects with 9 RBC units). Other reasons for postbaseline transfusion events 
reported for 7 of the 15 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group were surgery, leg ulcer/forearm 
fracture, foot ulcer/skin ulcer/anemia, fever, dengue fever, fatigue/dengue hemorrhagic fever, 
prophylactic measure before travel. 
Anemia was again the most frequently reported reason for a postbaseline transfusion event in the placebo 
treatment group. Other reasons for postbaseline transfusion events were reported for 8 of the 21 subjects 
in the placebo treatment group were: leg ulcer/skin ulcer, two separate events of traumatic fractures, 
asthenia/anemia, mitral valve incompetence, infection, surgery, diarrhea/anemia, EMH.

Assessment of Postbaseline Transfusion Events 
In the ITT population, postbaseline transfusion event frequency (defined as the sum of all transfusion 
events before efficacy cut-off date adjusted for continuous 12-week intervals) was nominally significantly 
lower among the luspatercept-treated subjects compared with the placebo-treated subjects (mean event 
frequency: 0.1 versus 0.3, respectively; nominal p = 0.0039) (data not shown). Similar results were 
noted for analyses over the entire duration of continuous 24-week intervals.

Overall Severity Score (NTDT) 
The disease severity scoring system was developed and published by Cappellini et al. to assess disease 
severity in patients with NTD thalassemia, based on parameters considered to be most pertinent in 
defining disease severity (Cappellini, 2016). Morbidity in NTD thalassemia is directly linked to the severity 
of ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. The novel scoring system was constructed based on clinical 
parameters thought to be most pertinent by these experts in defining disease severity in NTD thalassemia 
patients, based on their clinical experience and expertise. In total, 20 parameters were selected to define 
hematological and iron status, liver status, cardiovascular status, splenomegaly, renal status, pulmonary 
hypertension, leg ulcers, endocrinopathies, skeletal abnormalities, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. 
The domain score is tabulated by summing the score for all parameters. The total score is the sum of the 
domain scores, with a maximum of 52 points for adult patients; the higher the NTD disease severity 
score, the more severe the disease. 
The change from baseline in NTD disease severity score was a prespecified exploratory endpoint analyzed 
at Week 24 and Week 48 for subjects in the ITT population, but the results were only submitted with the 
second data cut off.

Serum Ferritin up to week 96 
The change from baseline in serum ferritin at Week 96 was analyzed for subjects in the ITT population 
and for subjects with or without ICT at baseline and/or postbaseline. 
In the ITT population, the mean change (SD) in mean serum ferritin from baseline to Week 96 was 
+72.53 (256.363) μg/L in the luspatercept treatment group and +211.51 (640.337) μg/L in the placebo 
treatment group. The between-group difference in LS mean change from baseline in serum ferritin level 
was −114.03 μg/L (nominal p = 0.5897). 
Similar results were observed when the change from baseline in serum ferritin at Week 96 was analyzed 
for subjects with or without ICT at baseline and/or postbaseline. In this analysis, 4 subgroups were 
evaluated based on their ICT use at baseline and postbaseline (ie, ICT use at both baseline and 
postbaseline, no ICT use either at baseline or postbaseline, ICT use at baseline but not postbaseline, and 
ICT use postbaseline but not at baseline). In each of these analyses, there was an increase in mean and 
LS mean change in mean serum ferritin from baseline to Week 96 in both the luspatercept and placebo 
treatment groups, but the increase was always smaller in the luspatercept treatment group, resulting in a 
between-group difference in LS mean change from baseline in serum ferritin level that favored 
luspatercept but was not significant.

Durability of response and potential for rebound effect 
As of 22-Sep-2021 (one year after the data cut-off date for the Type II variation submission), there are 
112 subjects remaining on treatment in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, including 77 subjects in the 
luspatercept arm and 35 subjects initially randomized to placebo who entered the Open-label Period 
(OLP) and began treatment with luspatercept. 
Mean Change from Baseline in Hb by 12-week Interval 
Subjects treated with luspatercept achieved an LS mean increase from baseline (improvement) in Hb of 
1.28 g/dL during the Week 1-12 interval which increased in the Week 13-24 interval (1.48 g/dL) and was 
generally maintained through Week 132-144 among subjects remaining in the study. These 
improvements reached nominal significance versus placebo at all time intervals up to Week 96 (beyond 
which inferential statistics were not provided owing to the crossover of placebo subjects into the OLP).

Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 is an ongoing pivotal phase 2 study with a 
double-blind, randomised (2:1), placebo-controlled, multi-center design to 
determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept versus placebo (on top of 
BSC) in adults with anemia associated with Non Transfusion Dependent (NTD) β-
Thalassaemia (either β-thalassemia or HbE/β-thalassemia, with or without 
concomitant α-globin mutation and/or duplication). 
NTD was defined as 0 to 5 units of RBCs received during the 24-week period 
prior to randomization. Patients were required to have a mean baseline Hb of 
≤ 10.0 g/dL, based on a minimum of 2 measurements ≥ 1 week apart 
within 4 weeks prior to randomization; Hb values within 21 days after 
transfusion were excluded. They were further required not to be on a regular 
transfusion program and to be RBC transfusion free for at least ≥ 8 weeks 
prior to randomization. 
Patients were randomised stratified baseline Hb category (< 8.5 versus ≥ 
8.5 g/dL) and baseline NTDT-PRO T/W domain score category (≥ 3 versus < 
3). 
After unblinding, patients were allowed to roll over to the overarching long 
term study LTFU-001.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Two supportive studies (A536-04/06) were conducted. To compare efficacy data to pivotal study ACE-
536-B-THAL-002, a subset of subjects from studies A536-04/06 that matched key inclusion criteria and 
approximated the dosing of study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 was defined and used for an integrated summary 
of efficacy (ISE; see below). 
Supportive studies 
A536-04 was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, ascending dose study to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
ACE-536 in subjects with β- Thalassemia. A536-06 was an extension study to evaluate long-term effects 
in patients previously enrolled in study A536-04. Studies A536-04/06 have been also part of the initial 
submission in TD β-thalassemia patients. At the time of initial submission study A536-04 was completed, 
and study A536-06 was still ongoing, but is now completed.  
The supportive Phase 2 studies (A536-04/06) were conducted in Europe (Italy and Greece) and enrolled 
both NTD and TD β-thalassemia subjects. To compare efficacy data to pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-

002, a subset of subjects from studies A536-04/06 that matched key inclusion criteria and approximated 
the dosing of study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 was defined and is referred to as the “BEYOND-like Population” 
(n=19), which was used for the integrated summary of efficacy (ISE) data pool.  
The primary objective of extension study A536-06 was long-term safety and tolerability of luspatercept. 
During the initial submission, both TD and NTD β-thalassemia patients (total n=64) were included for the 
integrated summary of safety (ISS) data pool from studies A536-04/06. For the current submission, ISS 
data pool comprises NTD β-thalassemia patients only (n=33). Of the 33 NTD β-thalassemia subjects who 
were enrolled and treated with luspatercept in A536-04, 2 subjects became TD prior to entering A536-06 
and were not included in the integrated summary of efficacy (ISE). 
Study A536-04 
At the time of initial submission study A536-04 was already completed and discussed in the clinical AR.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the proportion of β-thalassemia subjects who had an 
erythroid response, defined as: 1) an Hb increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline for ≥ 14 days (in the 
absence of RBC transfusions) in NTD β-thalassemia subjects; [or 2) ≥ 20% reduction in RBC transfusion 
burden during any rolling 12-week window on treatment compared to pre-treatment in TD β-thalassemia 
subjects. 
Treatments and Doses 
Subjects in all cohorts received luspatercept, administered SC, every 3 weeks for up to 5 cycles. The dose 
level for the first cohort was 0.2 mg/kg and the dose levels for subsequent cohorts followed a modified 
Fibonacci dose escalation scheme (i.e., maximum dose of 0.4 mg/kg for cohort 2, up to 1.5 mg/kg for 
cohort 7). Due to efficaciousness of assessed dose levels, the Safety Review Team determined expansion 
cohort doses ranging from 0.8 to 1.25 mg/kg.  
Recruitment  
First subject first visit: 11 Feb 2013. Last subject last visit: 11 Nov 2015. Completed CSR: 29 Aug 2018. 
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis 
Each dose escalation cohort consisted of up to 6 subjects. The expansion cohort (target enrolment of 30 
subjects) was designed to include a minimum of 12 NTD β-thalassemia subjects and 12 TD β-thalassemia 
subjects.  
All summaries were descriptive. No randomization or formal hypothesis testing was planned. 
Study Subjects 
•  NTD β-thalassemia subjects (defined as having received < 4 units of RBCs within 8 weeks prior to 
Cycle 1 Day 1 [C1D1]) 
• 
TD β-thalassemia subjects (defined as requiring ≥ 4 units of RBCs every 8 weeks confirmed over 
6 months prior to C1D1) 
A total of 64 subjects were enrolled in the study; 35 subjects were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase 
at dose levels of 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg and 29 subjects were enrolled in the expansion cohort. NTD β-
thalassemia subjects (n=33) comprised 51.6% of the total population. Overall, 56 subjects (87.5%) 
received the planned 5 cycles every 3 weeks of luspatercept. Five (7.8%) subjects discontinued treatment 
on the advice of the physician. Two (3.1%) subjects did not complete the study due to protocol 
deviations, and 1 (1.6%) subject withdrew from the study.

Efficacy Assessment  
NTD β-thalassemia subjects are the primary focus of this submission.  
For the primary endpoint, 9 (27.3%) of the 33 NTD β-thalassemia subjects had a Hb increase ≥ 1.5 g/dL 
sustained for ≥ 14 days, all of whom were treated with luspatercept at dose levels of ≥ 0.8 mg/kg. 
Overall, 14/33 NTD β-thalassemia subjects (42.4%) had an erythroid response, defined as mean Hb 
increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL over any rolling 12-week interval during the study.  
Iron Metabolism Parameters: In NTD β-thalassemia subjects with baseline LIC < 3 mg/g DW (dry 
weight), there was little overall change in mean LIC levels. In NTD β-thalassemia subjects with baseline 
LIC ≥ 3 mg/g DW, a total of 9/20 (45.0%) subjects had LIC reduction ≥ 1 mg/g DW. No marked changes 
were observed in serum iron, TIBC, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor, ferritin, and hepcidin levels. 
Erythropoiesis Parameters: Overall, the observed levels of EPO and nucleated RBCs increased from 
baseline to EOT. The increase was larger for subjects treated with 0.6 to 1.25 mg/kg than for those 
treated with 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg. Observed levels of reticulocytes decreased slightly from baseline to EOT in 
subjects treated with 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg and increased from baseline in subjects treated with 0.8 to 1.25 
mg/kg.  
Haemolysis Parameters: Overall, the mean observed levels of haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, and LDH 
increased from baseline to EOT. 
Bone Metabolism Parameters: The mean observed levels of BSAP and CTX increased from baseline to 
EOT. No dose-related trends were apparent. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints: 
Overall, mean levels of GDF11 and GDF15 increased from baseline to EOT, and levels of GDF8 decreased 
slightly from baseline to EOT. There were no clinically meaningful patterns in change in spleen size, BMD, 
EMH mass size, leg ulcer size, and 6MWT distance. 
Quality of Life assessments are limited for this study and will be discussed more fully in the extension 
study (A536-06) that followed this base study. Overall, mean changes from baseline in all components of 
the FACT-An subscale were small. SF-36 domain T-scores decreased slightly in all components. 
Study A536-06 
At the time of initial submission study A536-06 was ongoing and results as of the 31 August 2017 clinical 
data cut-off date were discussed in the clinical AR, the study is now completed. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of luspatercept in 
subjects with β-thalassemia who were previously enrolled in Study A536-04. Efficacy was included as a 
secondary endpoint to evaluate erythroid response. 
Treatments and Doses 
This study evaluated the effects of up to 5 years of luspatercept treatment in subjects with β-thalassemia 
previously enrolled and treated with luspatercept for up to 3 months in Study A536-04. Subjects without 
treatment interruption (see below) continued dosing with luspatercept at the same dose level 
administered at their last dose in Study A536-04. All subjects with treatment interruption were initially 
treated with luspatercept at a starting dose level of 0.8 mg/kg.

Recruitment 
First subject first visit: 20 Oct 2014. [Last subject last visit: 28 Apr 2020.] Data cut-off: 18 June 2020. 
Completed CSR: 24 Sep 2020. 
Study Subjects 
For “subjects without treatment interruption” C1D1 of Study A536-06 took place 28 (± 7) days after the 
last dose administered in Study A536-04. Subjects who completed the EOS visit for Study A536-04 and 
were ≥ 28 days post EOS visit were considered “subjects with treatment interruption”. For subjects 
without treatment interruption, transfusion status (NTD or TD) carried over from base study A536-04. 
The NTD β-thalassemia subjects with treatment interruption were defined as subjects who required 
transfusion of < 4 units of RBCs over the 8 weeks prior to C1D1 of Study A536-06. For TD β-thalassemia 
subjects with treatment interruption, transfusion status carried over from base Study A536-04. 
A536-06 study enrolment has completed with 51 subjects out of 64 who participated in the base study. 
For subjects without treatment interruption (n = 26), data from Study A536-04 are included in the 
combined analysis of Studies A536-04/A536-06. For subjects with treatment interruption (n = 25), only 
data from Study A536-06 were included in the analysis. 
Of total 27 NTD β-thalassemia subjects, 17 (63%) entered after treatment interruption. One participant 
changed from NTD status in Study A536-04 to TD status in Study A536-06. In the ISS, this subject is 
categorized as having NTD β-thalassemia. 
Efficacy Assessment 
NTD β-thalassemia subjects are the primary focus of this submission.  
No primary efficacy endpoint was specified for this study as the primary objective for this study was to 
evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of luspatercept. 
Erythroid Response: For NTD β-thalassemia subjects (receiving ≥ 0.6 mg/kg luspatercept), 21 (77.8%) 
had an Hb increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL over any rolling 8- or 12-week interval, in the absence of RBC transfusion.  
Time to and duration of erythroid response had changed in NTD β-thalassemia subjects compared to the 
data cutoff date from the initial application: the mean (SD) time to erythroid response and duration of 
erythroid response for NTD subjects was 19.1 (30.96) days and 668.4 (273.82) days, respectively, in the 
initial application. The updated mean (SD) time to erythroid response and duration of erythroid response 
for NTD participants is 13.6 (19.28) days and 1147 (637.52) days, respectively. 
Iron Metabolism Parameters: At ≥ 18 months, for NTD participants with baseline LIC ≥ 3 mg/g DW, 6 
(60.0%) of 10 NTD participants had an LIC reduction of ≥ 1 mg/g DW. The majority of participants with 
an elevated LIC at baseline were also on stable ICT therapy, possibly confounding interpretation of any 
LIC-lowering effect of luspatercept in this study. 
Mean values for serum ferritin for all participants decreased progressively during the majority of the 
treatment period.  
Erythropoiesis Parameters: Mean EPO levels were minimally changed in NTD participants. The observed 
mean levels of reticulocytes increased from baseline during the initial cycles in NTD responders, and then 
gradually returned toward baseline. Overall, in the safety population mean counts of nucleated RBCs 
increased from baseline during the initial cycles and dropped below baseline towards the end of study. 
Haemolysis Parameters: Observed mean levels of total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin increased from 
baseline in NTD non-responders, whereas they were largely unchanged in NTD responders. Mean LDH 
levels increased from baseline during the initial cycles, and then decreased toward baseline in NTD non-
responders and gradually decreased further in NTD responders.

Bone Metabolism Parameters: Mean observed levels of BSAP and CTX were slightly increased from 
baseline to C4D1 and changes were not thought to be of clinical significance. Mean total hip and lumbar 
spine BMD by DXA were minimally changed between screening and EOT. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints:  
Quality of life questionnaires, including NTDT-PRO, FACT-An, FACIT-Fatigue, and SF-36, were completed. 
Mean changes from baseline questionnaires, including NTDT-PRO, FACT-An, and SF-36, were small, with 
transient increases or decreases from baseline for NTD participants. The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire 
indicated an improvement from baseline by week 12, which was maintained over time in NTD 
participants. This improvement was most pronounced in participants who were symptomatic at baseline, 
indicated by a baseline score < 44. The NTDT-PRO tiredness/weakness domain score and FACIT-Fatigue 
score were inversely correlated. At week 24, the FACIT-Fatigue score and Hgb change from baseline were 
correlated in NTD participants. 
In NTD participants, compared to baseline, there was an initial improvement in 6MWT distance measured 
at weeks 16 to 24, followed by continued improvement from baseline at weeks 48 and 72. 
There were no clinically meaningful patterns in change in spleen size, EMH mass size, leg ulcer size, and 
hormone parameters. 
Integrated Summary of Efficacy 
To compare efficacy data of supportive studies A536-04/06 to pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, a 
subset of subjects that matched key inclusion criteria and approximated the dosing of study ACE-536-B-
THAL-002 was defined and is referred to as the “BEYOND-like Population” (n=19; defined as NTD β-
thalassemia subjects receiving 0 to 5 units of RBCs during the 24-week period prior to study enrolment 
and receiving > 0.8 mg/kg of luspatercept subcutaneously every 3 weeks). 
Baseline characteristics were mostly aligned between the luspatercept treatment groups across different 
studies, except there was a higher proportion of splenectomised subjects and subjects receiving iron 
chelation therapy in supportive studies A536-04/06 compared to pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
Most efficacy outcomes showed comparable results between all NTD β-thalassemia subjects in supportive 
studies A536-04/06 and the “BEYOND-like Population”. Overall, similar trends were also observed in 
pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and the “BEYOND-like Population”, albeit the effects were generally 
smaller. For the primary endpoint (mean Hb increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL from Baseline to Week 13 to 24, over a 
continuous 12 week interval), 57.9% were responders in the “BEYOND-like Population”, whereas 77.1% 
were responders in ACE-536-B-THAL-002. Comparable differences were observed for most secondary 
endpoints, except FACIT-F Fatigue Subscore change from baseline to week 13-24, which was 3.17 in the 
“BEYOND-like Population” (vs. 1.95 in ACE-536-B-THAL-002). A comparison of NTDT-PRO was not 
provided since only 5 participants had baseline data in supportive studies A536-04/06. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 was a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre study to determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in adults 
with non-transfusion dependent beta (β)-thalassemia (Hb≤10 g/dL). Patients had a documented 
diagnosis of β-thalassemia or HbE/β-thalassemia, with or without concomitant α-globin mutation and/or 
duplication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 163/245 
 
 
 
In addition, two supportive phase II studies were submitted; A536-04, an open-label, single-arm, 
ascending-dose study and its long term extension study A536-06. 
The pivotal study consisted of four periods: Screening Period for up to 4 weeks (± 3 days) for safety and 
baseline determination (incl. Haemoglobin [Hb]; transfusion history was collected for 24 weeks before 
randomisation, as applicable); a double-blind (DB) treatment period of 48 weeks; an Open label period 
(OLP) of maximum 15 months. After study drug discontinuation, patients will be followed for 5 years 
from the first dose of study drug or 3 years from the last dose of study drug (whichever occurs later) until 
EOS during a Post-treatment follow-up period (PTFP). 
The initial submission included the 48-week results as well as some additional efficacy data up to a 
second cut-off date (RBC transfusions, serum ferritin), by which the median treatment duration in the 
luspatercept group was 124.8 weeks (cut-off 15-March-2021). Placebo-treated patients were allowed to 
cross-over to open label Luspatercept treatment after the initial double-blind controlled treatment phase. 
All subjects from ACE-536-B-THAL-002 were allowed to roll-over into the overarching long term follow-up 
study LTFU-001, which was expected to occur during the second half of 2022. At the second cut-off date, 
out of 145 initially enrolled subjects, 112 remained on treatment in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, 
including 77 subjects (80%) in the luspatercept arm and 35 subjects (71.4%) initially randomized to 
placebo who entered the Open-label Period (OLP) and began treatment with luspatercept. As per the 
most recent cut-off date (09 Sep 2022), 71.9% (n=69) of the initially randomised Luspatercept treated 
patients continued treatment. Out of the placebo patients that overall crossed over to Luspatercept 
(n=38/59), 73.7% (n=28) are currently continuing treatment. The main reasons for discontinuing the 
study was withdrawal by subject without having further information at hand.  
Submitting a single pivotal study is accepted, since supportive results come from the already approved TD 
β-Thalassaemia  and  MDS  population.  The  small  sample  size  had  already  been  criticised  in  the  scientific 
advice procedure, as relevant subgroup analyses may not be robustly assessed. This may be viewed as a 
remaining uncertainty to the interpretability of the study results, though does not preclude the approval 
after thorough review of the totality of evidence. 
The design of the study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, the choice of comparator and choice of the target patient 
population  are  largely  in  line  with  the  EMA  Scientific  Advice  (EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/2015/PA/III; 
EMEA/H/SAH/044/1/FU/1/2016/PA/II), with the exception that a broader population was included than had 
initially been agreed (see below).  
In NTDT patients, not requiring regular transfusion therapy for survival, the focus of treatment benefit is 
set on treating the underlying chronic anaemia, which in NTDT is thought to be mainly due to ineffective 
erythropoiesis and, to a lesser extent when compared to TD patients, due to haemolysis. Consequently, 
associated pathological mechanisms (bone expansion, hypersplenism, increased intestinal iron absorption 
(ultimately iron overload) and hypercoagulable state) as well as downstream manifestations of the disease 
such as liver disease, bone deformities, osteoporosis, hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoietic 
pseudotumours, thrombotic events, vascular manifestations (such as leg ulcers or pulmonary hypertension) 
might be expected to be counteracted in the long term due to treatment of the underlying anaemia. Hence, 
an improvement in hematologic parameters may be assumed to a) result already in the short term in an 
improvement of anaemia-specific symptoms (among which shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and 
fatigue  have  been  particularly  investigated  in  this  study)  and  a  lower  need  of  (sporadic)  transfusions, 
presumably resulting in an improvement in quality of life and b) also show long-term benefits with regard 
to co-morbidities associated with ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic anaemia (incl. iron overload). 
The MAH uses ‘increase in hemoglobin of at least 1 g/dL during 12 weeks’ as primary outcome parameter, 
which directly relates to the postulated mechanism of action of Luspatercept and is considered a parameter 
of interest. However, it is highlighted that this is not an established surrogate for long term outcome. 
Assessment report

Specifically,  there  is  some  evidence  from  published  literature  data  that  supports  the  clinical  benefit  of 
increasing  Hb  levels  in  NTDT  B-Thalassaemia  patients  (the  most  relevant  are  listed  below).  These  were 
cross-sectional and retrospective studies. In these studies, higher Hb levels at baseline were shown to be 
associated with a lower risk of co-morbidity development and mortality, while lower Hb levels at baseline 
are associated with more unfavourable outcomes in β-thalassamia patients.

(http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcmd.2015.05.011) 
(2) Musallam et al, 2021: Morbidity-free survival and haemoglobin level in non-transfusion dependent B-
thalassemia: a 10 year cohort study (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-020-04370-2)

(4) Musallam et al., 2021: Variations in hemoglobin level and morbidity burden in non-transfusion-
dependent β-thalassemia (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-021-04456-5). 
These  results  represent  inter-patient  variations  linking  Hb  levels  to  co-morbidity  risk.  The  longitudinal 
variation of Hb levels over time and implications thereof on the development of co-morbidities/mortality 
risk  yet  remains  to  be  evaluated  by  prospective  studies,  i.e.,  whether  associated  outcomes  apply  to 
haemoglobin changes over time in the individual patient remains to be elucidated. It also remains unknown 
what effect size on Hb level (due to treatment) would be needed to result in a certain improvement in long 
term  outcomes  such  as  co-morbidity  risk  or  mortality  reduction.  The  Long  term  efficacy  LFTU  study  will 
provide additional efficacy and safety data (please see RMP section). 
Several limitations with regard to the available studies need to be kept in mind: As regards the established 
association between Hb levels and long term co-morbidity risk reduction, confounding effects can ultimately 
not be ruled out as explanatory factors. The rather small sample size (yet recognising the orphan character 
of  the  disease)  and  retrospective  design  have  important  bearings  on  the  interpretability  of  the  results. 
Furthermore, the results may not be fully applicable to the entire NTD Beta-thalassaemia population due 
to possible selection bias and cannot be easily translated to the present study population. As an overarching 
comment to these studies, it is also not known in how far all these patients were reused for analysis across 
studies, as it seems that the same thalassemia centres and authors have been involved.  
Concluding, based on these data, a patient with a Hb level <10 g/dL may be assumed to be at higher risk 
of  developing  downstream  manifestations  associated  with  the  disease  (liver  disease,  EMH,  diabetes 
mellitus,  hypothyroidism,  hypoparathyroidism,  osteoporosis,  hypogonadism,  thrombosis,  pulmonary 
hypertension)  and  it  could  be  assumed  that  with  higher  Hb  levels,  the  morbidity  risk  might  decrease. 
However, as the increase of at least 1 g/dL in Hb cannot be considered an established/validated surrogate 
for the prediction of long term outcome, the impact on co-morbidities of Hb increase cannot be quantified 
for the time being. The study was also not designed to show benefits of Luspatercept treatment in the long 
term. 
From a technical perspective, the statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint is 
considered adequate. Overall, 96 and 49 subjects were randomised to luspatercept and placebo treatment, 
respectively.  A  rather  large  number  of  subjects  completed  24  weeks  of  treatment  (95.8%  and  89.9%, 
respectively), however, a larger number of placebo patients discontinued treatment up to week 48 (i.e., 
92.7 and 71.4% of subjects, respectively, completed the study). This imbalance is reflected by the reasons 
for  discontinuation,  with  more  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  the  luspatercept  group 
(withdrawal by subject: 9.4% vs. 20.4%; lack of efficacy: 1% vs. 34.7%). While this might be related to 
the fact that very few placebo patients achieved an Hb increase of at least 1 g/dL from baseline at some 
time point during the study, it also indicates a potential for functional unblinding. This would in particular 
be of concern with regard to handling of patients in terms of transfusion needs, but also in terms of QoL 
Assessment report

evaluations.  This  potential  for  functional  unblinding  needs  to  be  kept  in  mind  when  interpreting  these 
outcome parameters. Overall, the weeks 37-48 analyses may be less robust.   
The secondary outcome measures planned to support the primary outcome (mean Hb concentration in the 
absence of transfusion during Weeks 36-48, health related QoL (SF-36, FACIT-F), physical activity (6MWT) 
and  iron  parameters  (liver  iron  concentration  (LIC)  and  iron  chelation  therapy  (ICT)  daily  dose,  serum 
ferritin) are supported as additional important outcome measures.  
Development of the new disease-specific PRO tool (NTDT-PRO) is acknowledged and welcomed in principle, 
though the relevance thereof is questioned at this stage. Results need to be cautiously interpreted, since 
the new PRO is being validated and simultaneously used to provide key support for the clinical relevance 
of effects observed in terms of Hb increase from baseline in the pivotal study. This issue had been addressed 
already  in  the  initial  scientific  advice  (MEA/H/SAH/044/1/2015/PA/III),  where  it  was  stated  that  ‘Causal 
conclusions based on study outcomes derived from a setting where still two objectives are to be evaluated 
(i.e.  the treatment  outcome  on one hand  and the validation  of  the  PRO  measurement  tool  on  the  other 
hand) will lack reliability. Validation should ideally be performed in a well-known and independent setting. 
Therefore the suggested approach is not supported. Keeping this in mind it should be considered that a 
disease specific PRO tool for NTD β-thalassemia developed by Celgene might in the end not be applicable 
during ACE-536 development but only serve for later investigations.’ 
Evaluation  of  bone  mineral  density,  extramedullary  hematopoietic  (EMH)  mass  volume,  spleen  volume, 
pulmonary hypertension and leg ulcers was covered in the study as exploratory objectives (but only when 
present in the individual patient) and is supported, as improvement thereof would be considered a relevant 
treatment target. However, the low patient numbers limit interpretability of the results. 
As regards transfusion endpoints, results need to be cautiously interpreted due to remaining uncertainties 
such as limited information on reasons for infusions (at baseline) or impact of potential functional unblinding 
on  the  decision  for  need  of  transfusion.  Upon  request  the  MAH  further  explained  how  blinding  was 
maintained throughout the study. Adequate measures were in place to minimise the risk for inadvertent 
unblinding. However, given the robust Hb response in luspatercept treated patients compared to lack of Hb 
response in placebo treated patients and dose changes due to excessive Hb response in the Luspatercept 
treatment  group  only,  functional  unblinding  is  still  of  concern  and  this  remains  an  uncertainty  in  the 
interpretation of the transfusion endpoint as well as symptom improvement data.   
Additionally,  the  MAH  provided  updated  analyses  for  transfusion  event  rates,  transfusion  counts,  mean 
change in RBC transfusion units, serum ferritin and derived LIC. While these are overall acceptable, some 
uncertainties remain regarding number of imputed datapoints. 
At  baseline,  a  largely  transfusion-free  population  was  included,  with  approximately  85%  of  subjects  not 
having received any transfusions during the 24 weeks preceding randomisation. The NTD definition would 
include patients with 0 to 5 units/24 weeks, as a complement to the TD population (≥6 units/24 weeks), 
where luspatercept is already approved. It must be critically noted that no transfusion data dating back 
more  than  24  weeks  were  planned  to  be  retrieved  and  the  baseline  may  hence  be  challenged  to  be 
representative of the patient’s ‘real’ transfusion burden adequately reflecting their underlying severity of 
disease.  Comparability  between  groups  can  therefore  also  not  be  confirmed  for  longer  term  historical 
transfusion data.  
The concern on representativeness also applies to the Hb baseline, which was averaged based on at least 
2 measurements at least 1 week apart during 4 weeks before randomisation. For inclusion, only patients 
with a mean baseline Hb ≤10 g/dL were considered, which is endorsed as these patients seem at greatest 
risk for development of co-morbidities and impaired QoL. In addition, patients had to be transfusion-free 
in the 8 weeks before randomisation. This may allow to ensure that the Hb baseline level is not acutely

Page 166/245 
 
 
 
influenced by a drop in Hb associated with infections, surgeries etc., yet might also have implications to 
the representativeness of the target population.  
There is currently no reason to believe that the results from the study would not be extrapolable to genetic 
polymorphisms not covered by the study population. Note that an insufficient number of subjects with co-
morbidities associated with underlying anemia such as pulmonary hypertension, liver and kidney disease 
and diabetes were included in the study, which is reflected in the SmPC.   
The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 8.2 and 8.09 g/dL for Luspatercept and Placebo, respectively. 
The baseline NTDT-PRO T/W (Tiredness/Weakness) Domain Score was approximately 4.0 (out of 10) and 
balanced between treatment groups.  
Unfortunately, patients were not, as initially planned, ‘symptomatic’ of their disease (with regard to anemia-
related symptoms as assessed by the newly developed NTDT PRO T/W instrument, using a score of ≥3 out 
of 10). Obviously, any benefits in terms of symptom improvement may not be evident in the asymptomatic 
population, which comprised about one third of the overall population. Overall, the population is considered 
rather heterogeneous, including patients with and without anemia-related symptoms, with and without co-
morbidities associated with β-thalassaemia (incl. iron overload) and patients presenting with a broad range 
of haemoglobin values at baseline. The criticism mapped to the small sample size may be reiterated in that 
respect. Of note, a rather young population was included (mean/median age was approximately 40 years, 
balanced between treatment groups), which might explain that a relatively low number of patients were 
affected by β-thalassaemia co-morbidities.  
Supportive studies:  
A536-04 was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, ascending dose study to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
ACE-536 in subjects with β-thalassemia. The study enrolled both NTD and TD β-thalassemia subjects, who 
received luspatercept every 3 weeks for up to 5 cycles. To compare efficacy data to pivotal study ACE-536-
B-THAL-002,  a  subset  of  subjects  from  studies  A536-04/06  that  matched  key  inclusion  criteria  and 
approximated the dosing of study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 was defined and is referred to as the “BEYOND-
like Population” (n=19), which was used for the integrated summary of efficacy (ISE) data pool. 
A536-06 was an extension study to evaluate long-term effects in patients previously enrolled in study 
A536-04. This study evaluated the effects of up to 5 years of luspatercept treatment and post treatment 
follow-up for 3 years after last dose. The primary objective of extension study A536-06 was long-term 
safety and tolerability of luspatercept, which is discussed in the clinical safety section. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A consistent effect has been demonstrated on haemoglobin in terms of the primary endpoint (increase of 
at least 1 g/dL in Hb during weeks 13-24) as well as all secondary endpoints addressing haemoglobin 
change (a responder analysis using the higher threshold of 1.5 g/dL, continuous evaluation of Hb change 
from baseline and corresponding week 37-48 analyses). Furthermore, the effect on Hb level was 
consistent across most subgroups.  
The proposed dose titration strategy complicates the interpretation of study results since different dose 
levels were possible in the trial, the starting dose (1 mg/kg), up-titration (to 1.25 mg/kg) due to lack of 
response, down-titration (to 0.8, 0.6 or 0.45mg/kg) due to AEs or excessive Hb increase or dose delay in 
case of excessive Hb/WBC decrease or if Hb ≥ 11.5 g/dL. When analysed according to dose level, those 
subjects not requiring any dose increase within 24/48 weeks of treatment overall showed a more 
pronounced response compared to subjects that needed a dose increase. Nevertheless, the latter group 
of subjects may still achieve a sufficiently high Hb response, even though the benefit in terms of 
symptomatic improvement is less evident in these subjects. The stopping rule in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 167/245 
 
 
 
will ensure that patients that do not show an adequate response in Hb (increase from baseline Hb in the 
absence of transfusions after 9 weeks of treatment (3 doses) at the maximum dose level) will discontinue 
treatment.  
As mentioned, surrogacy of the selected primary endpoint for the prediction of a long term outcome is not 
established for this population. The meaningfulness of the observed effect size in terms of Hb increase is 
therefore difficult to translate into long term clinical benefit, which may be a particularly relevant 
consideration in a sub-population that does not present anemia-related symptoms, also taking into 
account the non-negligible safety profile. In order this address this Major Objection raised during the 
evaluation, the MAH has proposed to update the indication wording as follows: “Reblozyl is indicated in 
adults for the treatment of anaemia associated with transfusion dependent and non-transfusion 
dependent beta thalassaemia (see section 5.1).” 
In contrast to TDT patients, NTDT patients per definition do not depend on regular transfusion therapy for 
survival, but only sporadically need transfusion therapy, e.g. in case of concomitant infection or surgery, 
for the treatment of a clinical morbidity associated with disease such as EMH, leg ulcer etc. or for the 
treatment of acute anaemia- related symptoms. Some patients are significantly iron overloaded, which is 
attributed to the underlying ineffective erythropoiesis in this patient population (with subsequent 
increased intestinal absorption and, to a lower extent, from the sporadic transfusional iron accumulated 
over time). The magnitude of iron overload hence varies with clinical phenotype/disease severity and 
increases with age and cumulative transfusion therapy. However, in comparison with the TD population, 
transfusion therapy seems to only modestly contribute to the iron overload. Nevertheless, iron overload is 
also associated with morbidity in NTDT patients (Musallam KM, Cappellini MD, et al. Serum ferritin level 
and morbidity risk in transfusion-independent patients with β-thalassemia intermedia: the ORIENT study. 
Haematologica. 2014;99(11):e218-e221). 
The MAH claimed in the 2016 scientific advice procedure that the main treatment aim was to treat the 
symptomatic effects of anaemia commonly experienced in this population, potential beneficial effects on 
other complications of the disease would be also anticipated due to luspatercept’s mechanism of action. 
For this, they identified a population that would be symptomatic in terms of tiredness/weakness (or more 
generally fatigue). The CHMP had agreed with both improvement of QoL and prevention of co-morbidities 
being relevant treatment targets in a symptomatic population, but that patients with iron overload would 
be another subgroup of key interest, for whom control of iron overload would be a relevant benefit, all of 
which would need to be weighed against the risks associated with luspatercept treatment. Outcome 
parameters of interest in this patient group to help with interpretability of the meaningfulness of the 
primary endpoint would be measures of iron overload such as LIC or serum ferritin as well as the use of 
iron chelator therapy. The MAH claims that the study duration was too short to be able to show any 
benefits in the long term and that haemoglobin increase can be viewed a clinical benefit per se. 
Therefore, additional efficacy data will be provided as part of the long term extension LFTU study (please 
see RMP).  
Approximately 37.0% of the study population were having a clinically significant iron overload at baseline 
(> 800 μg/L Serum Ferritin or LIC > 5 Fe/g dw), while roughly 30% of subjects received ICT at baseline 
as well as around 40% during the study. 
Results in terms of iron parameters however do not indicate a significant effect of luspatercept compared 
to placebo. For LIC at week 48 and LIC/ICT responders at week 24 and 48, even a larger effect in the 
placebo group is evident, which the MAH possibly attributes to a greater proportion of placebo-treated 
subjects receiving concomitant deferasirox compared with the luspatercept-treated subjects (30.6% 
versus 24.0%, respectively). Overall, the MAH claims that changes in iron parameters attributable to the 
study drug were unlikely to be apparent by Week 48 and were influenced by baseline status and ICT 
usage. Results may also have been affected by an imbalance in splenectomy status (35.4% versus 53.1% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 168/245 
 
 
 
for luspatercept- and placebo-treated patients, respectively). Taken together, no relevant effect of 
luspatercept on iron overload can be observed. 
A new NTDT PRO T/W instrument has been developed to evaluate the most relevant symptoms affecting 
QoL in the NTDT β-Thalassaemia population, determined to be tiredness/weakness (T/W) and shortness 
of breath (SoB) or fatigue as a more general concept. A ‘symptomatic’ score of at least 3 out of 10 on the 
T/W domain of the NTDT-PRO has been defined. One issue that arises based on the eligibility criteria is 
that the MAH had initially planned to only include patients with a ‘symptomatic’ score in the NTDT PRO 
T/W at baseline (Scientific advice 2016). This score has been related to the fatigue domain of the FACIT 
PRO (Fatigue subscale), for which the MAH claimed that the average FACIT-F score for all 13 items in the 
general population is 44.2 on a 0-52 scale (higher scores indicating less fatigue and better functioning 
(Cella et al., 2002) (2016 SA)). In an NTDT population that shows a relevant symptomatic burden 
compared to the general population, improvement of those symptoms (T/W or fatigue) would logically 
reflect a relevant benefit, as measured with the NTDT PRO T/W outcome tool (taken drawbacks with 
regard to its validity aside) or the FACIT-F instrument (fatigue subscale).  
Roughly 70% of patients presented a ‘symptomatic’ score on the T/W domain of the NTDT-PRO at 
baseline, while roughly 66% of subjects had a score < 43 in the FACIT- Fatigue subscale score. This 
implies that a rather significant proportion of subjects were included in this study that could per se not 
show relevant changes in these symptoms, yet would still be treated with Luspatercept with the aim to 
prevent or reduce downstream manifestations of the disease in the long term. 
The study seems to have been sufficiently powered for the key secondary endpoint ‘Mean change from 
baseline in NTDT-PRO T/W domain score over a continuous 12-week interval from Week 13 to Week 24’. 
This endpoint has been assessed in the overall population. However, no statistically significant effect has 
been demonstrated (LS mean difference for luspatercept versus placebo -0.48 (95%CI: -1.03, 0.08)). 
Results in terms of NTDT PRO T/W and SoB are undermined by the fact that phase 3 data were used to 
confirm the validity/reliability of the PRO, limiting its interpretability as a confirmatory parameter. Further 
support is however derived from other secondary endpoints such as SF-36, FACIT-F or the 6MWT, where 
at least no detrimental effect for the overall population comparing luspatercept and placebo groups have 
been observed (looking at point estimates), though the results are also not reassuring in terms of clinical 
relevance of the observed mean changes compared to placebo. 
When analysed according to baseline symptomatic score, among subjects with a baseline NTDT-PRO T/W 
domain score of ≥ 3 (‘symptomatic’), the LS mean difference for luspatercept versus placebo was -0.73 
(95% CI: -1.48, 0.03).  
Among subjects with a baseline NTDT-PRO T/W domain score of < 3 (‘asymptomatic’), the level of 
symptoms was not improved compared to placebo patients (LS mean difference 0.11 (95% CI: -0.48, 
0.70)).  
Similarly discrepant subgroup results are observed, when subjects are analysed according to Hb baseline 
level, with patients with Hb level ≥8.5g/dL showing not notable benefit (LS mean difference: -0.13 (95% 
CI: -1.05, 0.80). 
It is further of note that among male subjects, no notable benefit was observed compared to female 
subjects (LS mean difference: -0.03 (95%CI: -0.81, 0.87) vs. -0.84 (95%CI: -1.58, -0.10)). In contrast, 
results in terms of Hb increase were similar comparing both subgroups. 
Also when looking at subjects with compared to without splenectomy, inconsistent QoL results are 
observed: LS mean difference for patients with splenectomy: -0.11 (95%CI: -0.77, 0.56) compared to 
subjects without splenectomy: -0.71 (-1.59, 0.18).  
These subgroup results need to be cautiously interpreted due to smaller number of patients included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 169/245 
 
 
 
The small mean increase of around 0.7 points (out of 10) compared to placebo as observed in the 
‘symptomatic’ population is difficult to interpret, bearing in mind a) the limitations/weaknesses mentioned 
with regard to the validation exercise, and b) that it is difficult to understand what a score averaged 
over 12 weeks means to the individual patient also with regard to a day-to-day variation. As noted, this 
is further complicated by inconsistent results observed across several subgroups (male subjects, subjects 
with Hb level ≥8.5g/dL and subjects with splenectomy). This the reason why the restriction to 
symptomatic patients in the indication, as proposed by the MAH during the evaluation was not considered 
acceptable.  
Results for the FACIT-F evaluation are in line with the results observed for the NTDT PRO T/W. However, 
as for the NTDT PRO T/W, it is unclear how the observed small mean improvement of 1.4 points (out of 
52) compared to placebo (during weeks 13-24) ought to be interpreted in terms of its meaningfulness. 
The MAH highlights the pronounced symptom improvement at weeks 37-48 in the different evaluations 
(NTDT SoB, T/W, FACIT Fs). However, results of weeks 37-48 need to be cautiously interpreted due to 
the high number of missing subjects in the analysis. In addition, all non-objective endpoint evaluations 
need cautious interpretation as the blinding could most likely not be upheld in this study, given the 
consistent improvement in terms of Hb in luspatercept patients, while none of the placebo patients 
showed a Hb response.  
Since there is little support from secondary endpoint results that would reflect a benefit of the observed 
Hb response, an expert group had been asked during the procedure on the relevance of the observed Hb 
increase. Based on this, it was concluded that the observed Hb response should be viewed as a relevant 
benefit to the patient per se – although it must be weighed with the safety profile associated with 
Luspatercept treatment. 
Supportive studies: 
Efficacy results of supportive studies A536-04/06 need to be cautiously interpreted due to differences in 
design specifics (e.g. lack of control, different endpoints, low patient numbers, different geographical 
regions). Results from supportive study A536-04 overall support the doses used in phase III and also the 
efficacy conclusions, although most endpoint outcomes indicated smaller effects (i.e. a lower number of 
responders compared to luspatercept-treated patients in pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002). 
Of 33 NTD β-thalassemia subjects treated with luspatercept in study A536-04, 2 subjects became TD prior 
to  entering  study  A536-06.  Upon  request,  a  detailed  description  of  those  subjects  was  provided.  It  was 
concluded that the transition from NTD to TD is unlikely to be linked to luspatercept treatment.

Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 20th October 2022 and were asked to respond to the 
following efficacy questions as agreed by CHMP: 
1. Do the submitted efficacy results establish clinical benefit for the target population with 
NTD beta-thalassemia applied for? Please elaborate why (not). 
Yes. The expert group agreed unanimously that the improvement of Hb levels associated with 
luspatercept is expected to represent a clinical benefit for the target population with unmet medical need. 
This effect is expected to result in improvements in morbidity or mortality, which are difficult to observe 
given the long timelines needed.   
There are limited therapeutic options in this population, including iron chelation, splenectomy, and 
transfusion strategies, which are however limited due to the high risk of alloimmunization. Additional safe 
and effective treatment options are needed in this population, who will develop a number of complications 
involving many organs and systems, including iron overload, hypercoagulability, cardiomyopathy and 
osteoporosis.  
The difference in proportion of patients with ≥ 1 g/dL Hb increase associated with luspatercept v. placebo 
in the pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 was large (difference from baseline during weeks 13-24; 
77.1%; 95%CI: 63.4-87.0). During a fixed 12-week interval (Week 13-24), a mean change in Hb of 1.42 
g/dL (95%CI: 1.16-1.67) compared to placebo was observed, which continued also in the Week 37-48 
period. The effect on Hb level was consistent across most subgroups. 
There is a pharmacological rationale to expect an association with long-term benefits, as shown for 
instance with the effect of exogenous Hb (Mussalam et al., 2013; Bana, 2012; Chen et al. 2020). The 
effect reported in terms of health-related quality of life was promising although the validity of the tool and 
anecdotal reports have been questioned. External uncontrolled data from small studies with hydroxyurea 
are limited but also support the pharmacological rationale. 
The observation of ameliorations on complications takes decades of follow-up, which does not seem 
justified given the unmet medical need. Currently, there is no other endpoint that is known to better 
predict long-term outcome.  
An approval on the basis of improvement in Hb levels seems justified given the manageable toxicity (see 
below).  
Overall, a clinical benefit is plausible but given the remaining uncertainties it is important that 
uncertainties about long-term effects are part of the clinical decisions. 
2. Does the expert group consider the safety profile as observed in the clinical study and 
mainly known from other indications acceptable for the NTD thalassemia patient population? 
o  More specifically, how does the expert group see the risk for EMH masses, 
traumatic fractures, hypertension, worsening of liver and kidney parameters in 
the context of the overall less severely affected patient population of NTDT 
compared to TDT? 
The expert group agreed that overall the safety profile was acceptable although it will be important to 
collect long-term safety data post-approval to address remaining uncertainties. In particular:  
• 
The risk of fractures in NTDT patients associated with luspatercept was considered acceptable. 
However, the relationship between timing of luspatercept treatment and fractures should be 
further analysed based on available data and further data, as necessary, adjusting for age and 
gender (e.g., stratification). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 171/245 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
The risk of EMH was considered acceptable. The expert group agreed that there should be 
recommendations about screening patients by imaging before entering into treatment, and 
follow-up, and that treatment options should be re-discussed in the event of an increase in known 
EMH, the appearance of new masses or of symptoms related to EMH.  
The risk hypertension was considered acceptable. The identification of risk factors should be 
further explored on the basis of available data and further data, as necessary, adjusting for age 
and gender.  
The risk for liver and kidney disease was considered acceptable. It should be recommended to 
maintain the follow-up on iron-overload and blood tests according to standard local best  practice. 
See for example, https://www.thalassemia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TIF-2021-
Guidelines-for-Mgmt-of-TDT.pdf and applicable national recommendations on clinical 
management of long term organ damage in hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia included. (See for 
example, https://www.site-italia.org/protocolli.php?166780619258.) 
•  Other risks that will need surveillance are the risk of thrombosis and the risk of development of 
malignancies. 
o  Are additional data needed to further characterize the safety profile of 
luspatercept in NTDT patients? 
Yes, overall profile is acceptable but there is a need to assess long-term safety, and further explore risk 
factors, especially for pathological fractures and hypertension, as well as to try to develop optimal 
management strategies.  
3.  
Given the heterogeneity of the NTDT patient population, does the expert group consider 
the study population representative of the NTDT patient population applied for? 
Yes. In terms of generalisability, the study appears to have included a relevant patient population. 
Concerning the precise definition of the target population the expert group debated the evidence, and 
pros and cons for different rules and thresholds. Strict rules based on clear-cut thresholds in Hb levels are 
difficult due to the non-binary nature of the endpoint. There is a need for clinical judgment since many 
aspects of clinical decisions require separate considerations for each patient until more long-term efficacy 
and safety data are available. However, for practical purposes, the expert group considered that the 
current proposal of a threshold of Hb ≤10 g/dL and presence of symptomatic anaemia, appears sensible.  
4. 
Do the experts believe that, in case Reblozyl would be approved for treatment of adults 
patients with anaemia associated with NTD beta-thalassaemia, further long-term efficacy 
and/or safety data should be generated? 
Yes – see above. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A consistent increase in Hb levels was demonstrated, although other endpoints (e.g. on iron overload, 
other co-morbidities or QoL) did not provide compelling evidence on additional clinical benefits. The key 
secondary endpoint employed NTDT PRO, which is not validated and also failed to show a statistically 
significant difference between luspatercept and placebo. Several other secondary outcome measures such 
as health-related QoL and functional exercise capacity showed trends favouring luspatercept over 
placebo, the observed differences between treatment-groups being however of questionable clinical 
relevance. Furthermore, no effect was seen in endpoints investigating the impact on co-morbidities 
associated with β-thalassemia (e.g. no effect on iron overload related parameters or splenomegaly and a 
Assessment report

potentially detrimental effect in terms of EMH masses). This could partly be due to patients being 
asymptomatic or being well adapted to their anemia and may also be partly due to a too short study 
duration where no long term effect can be observed. Overall, it could not be quantified in this study how 
the observed Hb increase will translate into long term benefit. Additional efficacy data will come from the 
long term efficacy LFTU study (please see RMP). However, the observed robust effect on Hb increase is 
considered a clinical benefit per se. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of luspatercept in the existing indications is summarised as follows: 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes: The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in patients 
receiving Reblozyl (at least 15% of patients) were fatigue, diarrhoea, asthenia, nausea, dizziness, 
back pain and headache. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or higher adverse drug reactions 
(at least 2% of patients) included syncope/presyncope, fatigue, hypertension and asthenia. The 
most commonly reported serious adverse drug reactions (at least 2% of patients) were urinary 
tract infection, back pain and syncope. Treatment discontinuation due to an AE occurred in 2.0% 
of patients treated with luspatercept and was due to fatigue and headache. 
• 
Transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia: The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in 
patients receiving Reblozyl (at least 15% of patients) were headache, bone pain and arthralgia. 
The most commonly reported Grade 3 or higher adverse drug reaction was hyperuricaemia. The 
most serious adverse reactions reported included thromboembolic events of deep vein 
thrombosis, ischaemic stroke portal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Treatment 
discontinuation due to an AE occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with and was due to arthralgia, 
back pain, bone pain and headache. 
The MAH submitted this type II variation to obtain an extension of indication to include the treatment of 
adult subjects with non-transfusion dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia.  
Data from three clinical studies are presented to support the registration of luspatercept for the proposed 
new indication: 
• 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002: A pivotal Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre study to determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept in adults with NTD β-thalassemia 
(BEYOND study).  
• 
A536-04: A supportive Phase 2, open-label, ascending dose study to evaluate the effects of 
luspatercept in subjects with β-thalassemia. 
• 
A536-06: A supportive open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term effects of 
luspatercept in patients with β-thalassemia previously enrolled in study A536-04. 
Safety data from these three clinical studies are pooled for the integrated safety analysis (ISS). The 
safety data are presented as follows: Supportive studies A536-04/06 (NTD cohort), pivotal study ACE-
536-B-THAL-002 and pooled analysis of ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and the NTD cohort from studies A536-
04/06. 
Limitations of Pooling Data Sets 
There are multiple limitations regarding the pooling strategy of the integrated data: the supportive 
studies were single-arm open-label studies without comparator; there were differences in the doses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 173/245 
 
 
 
received, and the extent of exposure was shorter in the placebo treatment group compared with the 
luspatercept treatment group in the pivotal Study ACE-536- B-THAL-002, and the luspatercept exposure 
was shorter in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 compared with supportive studies. 
For these reasons, the company proposes to compare TEAE rates and review the exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates (EAIRs) of AEs. 
The EAIR per 100 subject-years was defined as 100 times the number of subjects with the specific event 
divided by the total exposure time (in years) among subjects included in the analysis. Subjects with 
multiple occurrences of the specific event in the specific analysis period were counted only once in the 
numerator. The exposure time for a subject without the specific event was the treatment duration, 
whereas the exposure time for a subject with the specific event was the treatment duration up to the 
start date (inclusive) of the first occurrence of the specific event. The total exposure time in years was 
calculated by dividing the sum of exposure time in days over all subjects included in the analysis by 
365.25. The EAIR per 100 subject-years was interpreted as the expected number of subjects with at least 
1 occurrence of the specific event per 100 subject-years of exposure to the IP. 
Patient exposure 
As of 24 Dec 2020, approx. 940 subjects have been exposed to luspatercept clinical studies, including 
357 subjects with MDS, 476 subjects with β-thalassemia, 83 subjects with MPN-associated MF, and 24 
healthy, postmenopausal females. The overall exposure from all sources globally is estimated to be 7,826 
patients as of 24 Dec 2020.  
Safety cut-off dates for ongoing and completed studies are provided in the following table: 
Table 75: Safety data cut-off for ongoing and completed studies  
The NTD β-thalassemia data pool includes 129 subjects who had received at least 1 dose of luspatercept 
and contains all subjects treated with luspatercept from the two supportive phase 2 studies (A536-04 & 
A536-06, n=33), and from the pivotal β-thalassemia phase 2 study (ACE-536-B-THAL-002, n=96). Only 
the pivotal phase 2 study was placebo-controlled and included 49 subjects. 
Updated data from the pivotal Phase 2 ACE-536-B-THAL-002 study were submitted after request for SAEs 
and AESIs with a cut-off date of 22 Sep 2021. 38 subjects who originally received placebo during the 
double-blind treatment period crossed over to receive luspatercept in the open-label phase. 
As of the 14 Sept 2020 initial data cut-off date, the 129 subjects had a mean treatment exposure of 
105.1 weeks and received thereby a mean of 31.7 doses. The average length of cycles between the doses 
was 24.9 days. The mean treatment exposure in each category is summarised in the table below.

o  Concomitant medication and procedures  
NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool (ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and A536-04/06 NTD Cohort) 
Concomitant medications were used by all subjects in the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool. The proportion of 
subjects receiving concomitant medications was generally consistent between the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group and the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
The most frequently reported classes of concomitant medications in the pooled luspatercept treatment 
group and the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (≥ 50% of subjects in either 
group) were antianemic preparations (86.8% and 85.7%, respectively); analgesics (77.5% and 55.1%); 
vitamins (67.4% and 57.1%); antibacterials for systemic use (57.4% and 51.0%); antiinflammatory and 
antirheumatic products (57.4% and 34.7%); and “all other therapeutic products” (51.9% and 46.9%), 
which included mostly iron chelators. 
Adverse events 
 Adverse events were analysed in terms of TEAEs, which was defined as any new AE or AE that worsened 
in severity on or after the first dose of IP until 63 days after the last dose of IP, as well as any SAE made 
known to the investigator at any time thereafter that was suspected to be related to the IP. If a subject 
experienced multiple TEAEs under the same SOC or PT, then the subject was counted only once for that 
SOC or PT. All AEs were coded using MedDRA version 23.0. The severity/intensity of TEAEs was graded 1 
to 5 according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
•  Overall Adverse Event Experience 
One luspatercept-treated subject from the supportive studies had Grade 5 (fatal) TEAE during the study. 
The AE leading to death (cardiac arrest) was not considered related to luspatercept. No subject had a 
Grade 5 TEAE in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 by the updated data cut-off date (22 Sep 2021).

Analysis of Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events 
The most frequent TEAEs of Grade 3 or 4 in the pooled luspatercept treatment group were traumatic 
fracture and hypertension (3.1% each) and AST increased, bone pain and menstruation irregular (2.3% 
each). Of these events, only traumatic fracture and AST increased were reported in the placebo treatment 
group (2.0%). All 4 subjects with Grade 3 or 4 traumatic fracture had Grade 3 events; 3 of the 4 subjects 
in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and the 1 subject in the placebo treatment group in Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002 had osteopenia or osteoporosis reported at baseline. All 4 subjects with Grade 3 or 
4 hypertension in the luspatercept treatment group had Grade 3 events; and 2 of these subjects had 
prehypertension or hypertension reported at baseline. All 3 subjects with Grade 3 or 4 menstruation 
irregular had Grade 3 events and all were females ≥ 44 years of age.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 as of the updated cut-off of 22 Sept 
2021. 
In the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool, 1 (0.8%) subject from the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
(Studies A536-04/06; NTD Cohort) died.  
• 
The subject was a 59-year-old, white male with an initial diagnosis of β-thalassemia 
approximately 1 year prior to study entry. 
The subject had relevant and ongoing medical history of arrhythmia (supraventricular and 
ventricular extrasystoles, and ventricular bigeminy), splenectomy, cholecystectomy, transient 
ischemic attack, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal re-entrant 
tachycardia, osteoporosis, appendectomy, and hypertension. 
The subject enrolled into Study A536-04 on 02 Apr 2014, at a dose level of 1 mg/kg. The 
subject’s last dose in Study A536-04 was on 25 Jun 2014, Study Day 85. The subject enrolled 
into Study A536-06 as a dose interrupted subject on 05 Nov 2014, Study Day 218, and started 
study treatment on 27 Nov 2014, Study Day 240, with a dose of 0.8 mg/kg. The dose of 
luspatercept was increased to 1 mg/kg on 08 Jan 2015, Study Day 282, and to 1.25 mg/kg on 30 
Jun 2015, Study Day 455, because the hemoglobin increase from baseline was < 1.5 g/dL 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023

throughout the previous 2 cycles at a single dose. The last dose was received on 30 Mar 2016, 
Study Day 729. Total treatment duration for this subject in Study A536-06 was 494 days with a 
total of 23 doses received. 
On 03 Mar 2015, Study Day 336, the subject had a loop recorder implantation operation. On 30 
Dec 2015, Study Day 638, electrocardiogram results showed sinus rhythm and counter clockwise 
rotation. On 16 Feb 2016, Study Day 686, echocardiography results showed slightly enlarged left 
ventricle, mild hypertrophy of septal and parietal wall, mitral valve fibrosclerosis, and 
hypomobility of posterior leaflet; left atrium size was noted to be at upper normal limit and 
diastolic function was normal. On 03 Apr 2016, Study Day 733, the subject experienced the SAE 
of cardiac arrest (verbatim: asystole). The subject was found lifeless in their garden and attempts 
at resuscitation were unsuccessful. The outcome of the event was fatal. The death occurred 5 
days after the last dose of study treatment. The reported cause of sudden death was unknown, as 
the first reading of the loop recorder only revealed asystole, preventing a clear diagnosis. Post 
mortem analysis of cardiac rhythm, which was registered by the previously implanted loop 
recorder highlighted a sudden transition from sinus rhythm to asystole. The investigator reported 
that an autopsy was not performed. 
In the opinion of the investigator, the event of cardiac arrest was not related to the study 
treatment. The investigator stated that to their knowledge there is no known mechanism of action 
of the study drug that can cause a sudden death. Moreover, in relation to the previous central 
nervous system and arrhythmic problems the subject experienced, the investigator stated that 
the death would have also occurred if the subject was not taking the study drug.

Pivotal Phase 2 ACE-536-B-THAL-002 study 
As of the updated data cut-off date of 22 Sep 2021, the percentage of subjects with SAEs was 26.5% 
(EAIR 23 per 100 subject-years) in the placebo treatment arm vs 16.7% (EAIR 6.9 per 100 subject-
years) in the luspatercept treatment arm, and 13.4% (EAIR 7.2 per 100 subject-years) including the 
cross-over subjects. Only a few SAEs have been additionally reported: New cases reported in the 
luspatercept treatment group included haemothorax, prostatic obstruction, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, 
haemoglobin decreased and skin ulcer each occurring in one patient. Pneumonia related to COVID-19 and 
pleural effusion occurred in 2 (2.1%) subjects. 
•  Analysis of adverse effects dose-response information 
Subjects with NTD β-thalassemia received luspatercept over a dose range from 0.2 to 1.25 mg/kg in the 
Supportive Studies A536-04/06 (NTD Cohort) and 1.0 mg and 1.25 mg/kg in the Pivotal Study ACE-536-
B-THAL-002 (Note: for this study, doses lower than 1 mg/kg [i.e., 0.6, 0.8 mg/kg] were possible if 
subjects needed to reduce their dose).  
A total of 129 luspatercept treated subjects with NTD β-thalassemia were included in the dose response 
analyses for the following safety measurements: Any TEAE Grade ≥ 3, SAEs, asthenia Grade ≥ 1, bone 
pain Grade ≥ 1, bone pain like events Grade ≥ 1, dizziness Grade ≥ 1, hypertension Grade ≥ 1, myalgia 
Grade ≥ 1, TEAEs leading to dose reduction, TEAEs leading to dose interruption, and TEAEs leading to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. Subjects were grouped under their actual dose level of 
luspatercept. For subjects who experienced a specified event more than once with different grades of 
severity, the actual dose level was the last actual dose level on or prior to the start date of the event with 
the highest grade. If there were multiple events with the same highest grade, the actual dose level was 
the last actual dose on or prior to the start date of the first event among them. For subjects with no 
specified event, the actual dose level was the last actual dose level of the study treatment. 
To minimise having small sample sizes for comparisons, the actual dose levels were grouped for low dose 
levels (0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg and 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg).

Analysis of Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Based on the nonclinical and clinical experience with luspatercept, the pharmacology of luspatercept, and 
comorbidities of β-thalassemia, the following types of events were summarised separately: 
Adverse events of special interest/Events of Interest: Malignancy disorders, premalignant disorders, EMH 
masses, thromboembolic events, kidney injury, hypertension, and musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain like 
events. 
These events were selected based on nonclinical or clinical findings from Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical 
studies of luspatercept in β-thalassemia and other indications:  
•  Based on findings from a juvenile toxicity study, malignancy and premalignant disorders were 
considered as adverse events of interest: 
- 
The PTs used to evaluate the malignancy EOI category were based on narrow scope of 
sub-Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) for malignancy related conditions; malignancy 
related therapeutic and diagnostic procedures; haematological malignant tumours; non-
haematological malignant tumours; haematological tumours of unspecified malignancy; 
nonhematological tumours of unspecified malignancy; and tumour markers. The PTs of 
human chorionic gonadotropin positive, human chorionic gonadotropin increased, 
leukostasis syndrome, tumour lysis syndrome, gammopathy and monoclonal 
gammopathy were excluded, as these conditions do not qualify as malignant tumors. 
- 
The PTs used to evaluate the premalignant disorder EOI category were all based on the 
narrow scope of sub-SMQs for blood premalignant disorders; gastrointestinal 
premalignant disorders; premalignant disorders, general conditions and other site-specific 
disorders; reproductive premalignant disorders; and skin premalignant disorders. 
• 
• 
The EMH masses EOI category was selected based on the numerical imbalance observed in 
subjects treated with luspatercept in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and the clinical relevance as a 
disease-related comorbidity. The PTs used to evaluate this EOI category were cutaneous 
extramedullary hemopoiesis and extramedullary hemopoiesis. 
The thromboembolic EOI category was selected based on the findings observed in the Phase 3 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001 and thromboembolic event is currently listed as an adverse drug 
reaction for subjects with TD β-thalassemia (Reblozyl USPI, Reblozyl SmPC). The PTs used to 
evaluate this EOI category were based on the narrow scope of sub-SMQs for embolic and 
thrombotic events, arterial; embolic and thrombotic events, venous; and embolic and thrombotic 
events, vessel type unspecified and mixed arterial and venous; as well as the MedDRA broad 
scope of SMQ thrombophlebitis. The PTs of device occlusion, device related thrombosis, 
thrombosis in device, and transient ischemic attack were excluded. 
• 
The kidney injury EOI category was selected based on nonclinical data. The PTs used to evaluate 
this EOI category were based on the broad scope of SMQ acute renal failure. In addition, 
albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) data for Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and Studies A536-04/06 
were analysed for the potential of nephron damage. The ACR data are presented separately for 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and Studies A536-04/06 due to the different visit schedules between 
these studies. 
• 
The hypertension EOI category was selected based on the findings observed in the Phase 3 
pivotal Studies ACE-536-MDS-001 and ACE-536-B-THAL-001; hypertension is currently listed as 
an adverse drug reaction for subjects with TD β-thalassemia (Reblozyl USPI, Reblozyl SmPC). The 
PTs used to evaluate this EOI category were based on the narrow scope of SMQ hypertension. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 190/245 
 
 
 
Treatment-emergent hypertension (based on the narrow scope of SMQ hypertension) was also 
summarized by subjects’ history of hypertension (Yes/No). 
• 
The musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOI category was selected based on the findings in the 
Phase 3 pivotal Study ACE-536-B-THAL-001. The musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs 
includes a collection of PTs that are indicative of a bone pain-like event: back pain, bone pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, neck pain, pain in extremity, pain in jaw, and spinal pain. 
Analyses of individual AESI categories are presented in the subsequent sections.

All events from the pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, except one were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, non-
serious in nature, ongoing as of the data cut-off date, considered by the investigator to be not related to 
the study drug, and did not result in study drug discontinuation. 2.0% (EAIR 1.6 per 100 subject-years) 
in the placebo treatment group experienced a Grade 3 EMH.

One subject in the luspatercept treatment group with an ongoing history of EMH masses prior to the start 
of luspatercept treatment experienced a Grade 4 SAE of spinal cord compression as a result of a pre-
existing paravertebral EMH mass. Prior to study entry, the subject had been on treatment with 
hydroxyurea for control of the underlying EMH masses approximately 8 months prior to the start of 
luspatercept treatment. The subject received the last dose of IP 6 days prior (Study Day 107) to the 
onset of the serious spinal cord compression. The SAE resulted in IP discontinuation. Following 
discontinuation of luspatercept treatment, the subject's Grade 2 extramedullary hemopoiesis mass was 
diagnosed.  
In addition to the 6 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group with EMH masses EOIs, 1 subject in the 
luspatercept treatment group experienced a TEAE of chest wall mass, which was reported as worsening of 
an existing chest wall extramedullary mass. Of these 7 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group, 3 
subjects had an increase in existing EMH mass size, 6 subjects reported a newly diagnosed EMH mass 
(includes the 3 subjects with existing EMH mass at baseline as previously described), and 1 subject had 
an EMH mass on Study Day 1 during a screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for extramedullary 
hemopoiesis prior to treatment (ACE-536-B-THAL-002 CSR Listing 16.2.6.3). 
One subject in the luspatercept treatment group also experienced an SAE of the PT spinal cord 
compression (verbatim term: extramedullary hemopoiesis masses expansion into spinal canal causing 
compression).  
One subject in the luspatercept treatment group and no subjects in the placebo treatment group had 
extramedullary hemopoiesis as a reported PT that led to IP discontinuation. No subjects had 
extramedullary hemopoiesis that led to dose reduction, and 1 subject in the placebo treatment group had 
extramedullary hemopoiesis that led to dose interruption. 
Screening and post-treatment MRI results for EMH masses were not performed in Studies A536-04/06 
(NTD Cohort). The proportion of subjects with EMH masses EOIs was higher in subjects in the 
luspatercept treatment group in Study A536-04/06 than subjects in the luspatercept treatment group in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (12.1% versus 6.3%), of which all were the PT of extramedullary 
hemopoiesis. No Grade 3 or higher extramedullary hemopoiesis masses were reported. Among subjects 
with treatment-emergent extramedullary hemopoiesis as a reported PT, none were considered SAEs or 
led to IP discontinuation. Two subjects had extramedullary hemopoiesis masses that led to dose 
reduction. 
The proportion of subjects with EMH masses EOIs was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
than in the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (7.8% vs 2.0%). When adjusted for 
exposure, the EAIR was 4 per 100 subject-years in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 1.7 per 
100 subject-years in the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
The proportion of extramedullary hematopoiesis masses EOIs occurred in ≤ 2 subjects between the 
different treatment cycles (NTD ISS Table 14.3.1.20). 
As of the 22 Sep 2021 updated data cut-off date, one additional luspatercept subject, after crossing over 
from placebo, had EMH masses reported (see Annex 2, Response to Q32). As of the 24 Dec 2021 updated 
data cut-off date (where EMH masses were analysed in response to a FDA Information Request), a total 
of 9 (6.7%) subjects with EMH masses treated with luspatercept were reported in the pivotal ACE-536-B-
THAL-002 study.

Thromboembolic AESI 
Table 93: Thromboembolic EOIs (NTD Beta-Thalassemia safety population) 
One subject experienced one arterial event: Grade 3 bone infarction and 1 subject experienced 3 venous 
events (Grade 1 thrombosis, Grade 1 thrombophlebitis superficial, and Grade 2 thrombophlebitis 
superficial). All events were nonserious, possibly/probably related to IP, and resolved. Both subjects were 
splenectomised and had additional relevant risk factors. The subject with bone infarction was taking 
concomitant bisphosphonate and the subject with thrombophlebitis superficial had a history of 
thrombophlebitis superficial. Both subjects were already receiving acetylsalicylic acid and haemoglobin at 
time of event onset tended to be low (highest value 10.4 g/dL). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 195/245 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among the subjects with thromboembolic EOIs, none was classified as serious, led to dose reduction or 
led to IP discontinuation. One subject each had a thromboembolic EOI of bone infarction and 
thrombophlebitis superficial that led to dose interruption. Time to onset ranged between 27 to 353 days. 
There was no subject with elevated haemoglobin, and values ranged from 9.6 to 10.4 g/dL around the 
time of event. 
As of the 22 Sep 2021 updated data cut-off date, one additional luspatercept subject, after crossing over 
from placebo, had thromboembolic EOIs reported. 
Kidney Injury AESI 
Glomerulonephritis was observed in rat and monkey, and therefore kidney function and injury were 
evaluated in the clinical program. 
This section also summarises the following laboratory analyses: 
1. Reported kidney injury (i.e. decreased glomerular filtration rate [GFR]- and proteinuria-type AEs) 
2. Median ACR over time by cycle for subjects with ACR baseline Grade = 0 (ACR < 30 mg/g) and the 
worst postbaseline Grade = 1 (30 mg/g ≤ ACR < 1000 mg/g) receiving luspatercept in Studies A536-
04/06 (NTD Cohort) as well as a comparison over time of the median ACR for subjects receiving 
luspatercept versus placebo in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
3. Shifts from baseline to worst postbaseline NCI-CTCAE grade for ACR ratio and from baseline to EOT or 
last on treatment postbaseline NCI-CTCAE grade for ACR ratio. 
4. The clinical course for subjects who at some point during treatment with luspatercept or placebo had ≥ 
50% reduction in kidney function (ie, eGFR) compared with baseline.

A total of 5 subjects (3.9%; EAIR 2 per 100 subject-years) had a kidney injury EOI in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group compared with 0 subjects in the placebo treatment group of Study ACE-
536-B-THAL-002. The most frequently reported event in luspatercept-treated subjects was proteinuria 
(2.3%; EAIR 1.2 per 100 subject-years). Anuria, blood creatinine increased, blood urea increased, and 
GFR decreased were reported in 1 subject each (0.8%; EAIR 0.4 per 100 subject-years). No acute kidney 
injury TEAEs (i.e. renal failure, acute kidney injury, and renal impairment) were reported.  
The events of GFR decreased, anuria, blood creatinine increased, and blood urea increased resolved and 
were not suspected/unlikely related to IP. Of the 5 reported events of proteinuria in 3 subjects, all 5 
events were unlikely related to IP and 3 events were ongoing as of the data cut-off date. 
The proportion of kidney injury EOIs was highest within the first 4 cycles of treatment and between 
treatment cycles 21 and 24. 
As of the 22 Sep 2021 updated data cut-off date, in the luspatercept treatment group, kidney injury EOIs 
were reported for 6 subjects (6.3%, EAIR 2.5 per 100 subject-years) excluding the crossover subjects 
and 9 subjects (6.7%, EAIR 3.4 per 100 subject-years) including the cross-over subjects. Albuminuria 
and proteinuria were the only newly reported PTs in this category during the updated period. 
In the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool, there were 3 (2.3%) subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment 
group who experienced an eGFR ≥ 50% reduction in kidney function at some point during the study, 
compared with baseline, versus 1 subject in the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. 
This threshold was selected because it roughly correlates with CTCAE Grade ≥ 2 for acute renal failure 
events. Of the 3 subjects in the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool, 2 subjects were in Studies A536-04/06 
(NTD Cohort) and 1 subject was in the luspatercept treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. For 
all 3 subjects, ≥ 50% decreases from baseline in eGFR were transient and resolved. One of the 3 subjects 
(Study A536-04/06 [NTD Cohort]) experienced a TEAE of blood creatinine increased and blood urea 
increased. Both events were not considered related and there was no change to IP. The subject recovered 
from both events.  
Urinary Albumin/Creatinine Ratio 
In addition, albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) data were analyzed for the potential of nephron damage. 
ACR over time are shown by treatment group for subjects with ACR baseline Grade = 0 (ACR < 30 mg/g) 
and the worst post-baseline Grade = 1 (30 mg/g ≤ ACR < 1000 mg/g) in study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and 
for luspatercept-treated subjects in studies A536-04/06 (NTD Cohort).  
Grade 1 proteinuria includes microalbuminuria (30 mg/g < ACR ≤ 300 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria (300 
mg/g < ACR < 1000 mg/g). In general, ACRs in the luspatercept treatment were associated with small 
increases from baseline with no clinically meaningful differences compared with the placebo treatment 
group. There was no sustained, clinically meaningful elevation from baseline in median ACR values over 
time associated with luspatercept treatment.

The proportion of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group with normal (Grade 0) ACR and 
Grade 3 ACR at baseline (70.6% and 0%, respectively), was similar to the placebo treatment group in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. During study participation, the proportion of increasing ACR (worsening of ≥ 
1 grade) was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group than in the placebo treatment group in 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. Most of these changes were Grade 0 to Grade 1. For 1.6% of subjects in the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group, the worsening was 2 grades (Grade 0 to 2).

Hypertension AESI 
Hypertension has been reported in the luspatercept Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. Therefore, hypertension 
was identified as an EOI and evaluated in the luspatercept clinical program. 
Luspatercept has been associated with mean increases in SBP and DBP of approximately 5 mm Hg and 
has been infrequently associated with sustained blood pressure increases commensurate with a diagnosis 
of hypertension. 
Table 96: Hypertension events of interest (NTD beta-thalassemia safety population) 
The proportion of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group with hypertension EOIs was 31.0% 
(EAIR 20.7 per 100 subject-years), which is higher than the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-
B-THAL-002 by a difference of 14.7%, with a corresponding EAIR difference of 6.1 per 100 subject-years. 
Of note, among the subjects who experienced a hypertension EOI, the proportion of subjects with a 
medical history of hypertension was higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (20.0%; 8 of 40 
subjects) than in the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (12.5%; 1 of 8 subjects). 
The proportion of hypertension EOIs was highest within the first 4 treatment cycles. The median time to 
onset of hypertension was 84.5 days (range, 1.0 to 763.0 days) in the pooled luspatercept treatment 
group versus 37.5 days (range, 1.0 to 275.0 days) in the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-
THAL-002, with a median duration of 370.0 days (range, 1.0 to 930.0 days) and 166.0 days (range, 21.0 
to 546.0 days), respectively. 
At the updated data cut-off date (22 Sept 2021), hypertension events were reported for 35 subjects 
(36.5%, EAIR 20.9 per 100 subject-years) excluding the cross-over subjects and 39 subjects (29.1%, 
EAIR 20.9 per 100 subject-years) including the cross-over subjects. 
14 subjects required intervention as follows: 
•  Dose delay without any medications: 3 subjects (1021017, 2041001, 2041005) 
•  Dose delay and antihypertensive medication: 4 subjects (1021005, 1021006, 1021009, 1021014) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023

•  Dose reduction and antihypertensive medication: 2 subjects (2031005, 5012003) 
•  Dose reduction, dose delay and antihypertensive medication: 1 subject (1022015) 
•  Antihypertensive medication alone: 4 subjects (2041008, 2061006, 3011001, 5011004) The 
majority of subjects requiring intervention (11/14) were ≥ 50 years old. 
At the time of the data extraction, antihypertensive medication was still ongoing in 9 of the 11 subjects 
requiring antihypertensive drugs.  
The remaining 25 luspatercept-exposed subjects reporting a hypertension type event did not require any 
intervention. 
Musculoskeletal Disorder-Bone Pain AESI 
Table 97: Musculoskeletal disorder bone pain of interest (NTD-beta Thalassemia safety 
population) 
The proportion of musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs was highest within the first 4 cycles of 
treatment, independent of which treatment was administered (NTD ISS Table 14.3.1.20). The proportion 
of Grade 3 musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs was 2.3% (EAIR 1.2 per 100 subject-years) in the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group and 0% in the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-
002. No Grade 4 or higher musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs were reported. 
The median time to onset of musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs was 4.0 days (range, 1.0 to 1272.0 
days) in the pooled luspatercept treatment group compared with 42.0 days (range, 4.0 to 252.0 days) in 
the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, with a median duration of 16.0 days (range, 
1.0 to 1396.0 days) and 9.0 days (range, 1.0 to 322.0 days), respectively.

As of the 22 Sep 2021 updated data cut-off date, musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain EOIs were reported 
for 72 subjects (75.0%, EAIR 81.8 per 100 subject-years) in the luspatercept treatment arm excluding 
the cross-over subjects and 90 subjects (67.2%, EAIR 89.1 per 100 subject-years) including the cross-
over subjects. The most frequently reported PTs were bone pain (47 subjects, 35.1%) and back pain (43 
subjects, 32.1%).

Long-term Adverse Events 
To investigate the potential AEs after long-term exposure to luspatercept, an analysis of all the TEAEs 
reported for ≥ 5% of subjects in either treatment group in Study ACE 536-B-THAL-002 was performed by 
every 4 cycles up to Cycle 32. At the 22 Sep 2021 data cutoff date, 134 subjects initiated luspatercept 
treatment (including 38 subjects who crossed over from placebo treatment group to receive luspatercept 
after study unblinding), and by the start of Cycles 21 to 24, 82 subjects remained; by the start of Cycles 
29 to 32, 72 subjects remained.

in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (1.6% versus 0%). No subjects had Grade 4 leukocyte count postbaseline. 
No subjects shifted from normal (Grade 0) or Grade 1 platelet count to Grade 3 or 4 platelet count in the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group, similar to the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-
002. 
A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  shifted  from  normal  (Grade  0)  or  Grade  1  neutropenia  to  Grade  3 
neutropenia  in  the  pooled  luspatercept  treatment  group  compared  with  the  placebo  treatment  group  in

AST, and total bilirubin for Studies A536-04/06 (NTD Cohort), Study ACE-536-BTHAL- 002, and NTD β-
thalassemia Data Pool are presented. For all parameters the worst postbaseline value represents the 
worst increase from baseline. Except for total bilirubin, the majority of the values were Grade 0 at 
baseline. There were no Grade 5 results recorded for any of the parameters. 
NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool (ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and A536-04/06 NTD Cohort) 
No subjects had Grade 4 ALP, ALT or AST at baseline or postbaseline. 
The proportion of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group who shifted from Grade 2 total 
bilirubin values to Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin values was similar to the placebo treatment group in Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (13.2% and 10.4%, respectively), as was the proportion of subjects who shifted

Hy’s Law 
The baseline total bilirubin was elevated in 75.2% of luspatercept-treated subjects in the NTD β-
thalassemia Data Pool. Of the 9 subjects who potentially fit Hy’s Law criteria (ALT or AST ≥ 3.0 × ULN 
and total bilirubin ≥ 2.0 × ULN), all subjects had increased total bilirubin at baseline or screening and 4 
subjects had transaminases increased at baseline. None of the 9 subjects had confirmed drug-induced 
liver injury or symptomatic events and 3 subjects experienced liver enzyme elevations as a TEAE, all 
nonserious. The remaining 6 subjects with liver enzyme elevations were not reported as a TEAE. 
Treatment was not discontinued for any of these subjects in relation to the liver enzyme elevations. All 9 
subjects who potentially met Hy’s Law criteria recovered. 
All elevations in ALT and/or AST and total bilirubin in these subjects had alternative explanations, 
including: 
• 
• 
Four subjects with a history of liver disease (hepatitis C, hepatomegaly, cholelithiasis, and Gilbert 
syndrome) 
Five subjects with clinically significant iron overload with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg/g dry 
weight 
•  One subject with a concurrent TEAE (upper respiratory tract infection) around the time of 
elevation 
• 
Two subjects on concomitant medication known to potentially cause liver injury (one subject 
received paracetamol, and one subject received deferasirox and allopurinol)

Higher mean values over time for ALT and AST were observed at most time points in luspatercept-treated 
subjects in Pivotal Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. In Supportive Studies A536-04/06 mean postbaseline 
values of serum chemistry parameters varied slightly from baseline with no clinically significant trends 
observed.

Individual Subject Changes 
Shifts from baseline to worst postbaseline NCI-CTCAE grade for renal chemistry parameters of creatinine 
and eGFR for Studies A536-04/06 (NTD Cohort), Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002, and NTD β-thalassemia 
Data Pool are presented in Table 106. For creatinine, the worst postbaseline value represents the worst 
increase from baseline. For eGFR, the worst postbaseline value represents the worst decrease from 
baseline. The majority of the values were Grade 0 at baseline. There were no Grade 3-5 results recorded 
for either of the parameters.

The 2 cases of eGFR < 0.5 × baseline in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 were transient over one dose and 
returned to baseline at the next visit, with no recurrence after the first instance. One of the 2 subjects 
who experienced eGFR < 0.5 × baseline in Studies A536-04/06 (NTD Cohort) experienced additional 
recurrences after the first instance.

Pivotal Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
Overall, the mean blood pressures for subjects in the luspatercept treatment group were higher than those 
in  the  placebo  treatment group,  but  were generally  within  the  normal  range (Figures  below).  Variability 
between the 2 treatment groups for SBP and DBP changes after Dose 39 Day 1 was noted due to small 
sample size (ie, very few subjects reached treatment after Dose 40 as of the data cut-off date).

NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool (ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and A536-04/06 NTD Cohort) 
A total of 45.0% of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group had no increase in SBP and 
44.2% had no increase in DBP from baseline to last available assessment. More subjects in the pooled 
luspatercept  treatment group had increases from baseline of ≥ 20 mm Hg in SBP or DBP than subjects in 
the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-THAL-002 (3.9% versus 0% for SBP, and 3.1% versus 
0% for DBP). At most of the visits for these subjects, blood pressure values fluctuated between those 
measured at baseline and those measured at the last assessment (or were slightly above). All subjects 
with a ≥ 20 mm Hg increase in SBP at the last assessment had an SBP ≤ 131 mm Hg at that visit. All 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023

subjects with a ≥ 20 mmHg increase in DBP at the last assessment had a DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg at that visit. 
No subject in the pooled luspatercept treatment group had an SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or a DBP ≥ 100 mm Hg. 
Weight 
The proportion of subjects experiencing a weight decrease of ≥ 10% was higher in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-THAL-002 (5 [3.9%] and 1 
[2.0%], respectively). For most of these subjects, the decrease in weight was gradual and started 
increasing by the last assessment prior to cut-off. Two subjects experienced a more abrupt drop in weight 
(#3011014 and #4011037). There were no AEs reported in these 2 subjects with regards to weight drop 
but there were other AEs or SAEs reported during that period that could potentially explain the drop in 
weight. In all cases except one (#3011014) the decrease in weight was less than 12%. 
Safety in special populations 
Treatment-emergent AEs were analysed by intrinsic (age, sex, race, drug-disease interactions) and 
extrinsic (geographic region) factors. Analyses focus on the pooled luspatercept group due to population 
size and highlight differences of 10%. 
No clinically relevant differences were noted between any of the subgroups investigated. In general, any 
trends observed in the luspatercept treatment group across subgroups were also observed in the placebo 
treatment group. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from the study population and throughout the clinical 
development program. Female participants of childbearing potential (defined as sexually mature women 
who had not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or were not naturally postmenopausal 
for at least 24 consecutive months) and male participants in any luspatercept study were to use highly 
effective (Pearl index < 1% per year) birth control methods. 
As of the safety data cut-off date, there are no data regarding the clinical effects of luspatercept in 
pregnancy. There have been no pregnancies reported in female subjects or in a partner of male subjects 
participating in NTD β-thalassemia clinical studies. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
No analyses with regard to the safety in patients with hepatic or renal impairment have been undertaken. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of Luspatercept in children and adolescents under the age of 18 has not been established.  
Immunological events 
Pivotal Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
Method: Blood samples (approximately 3 mL) were collected from all subjects for assessment of ADAs 
against luspatercept in serum at the time points [Day 1 of Cycle 1 (baseline), Dose 2, 4, and 6; 8, 12, 16, 
and every 6 doses: at Dose 22, 28, 34, etc. up to max. 2 years from Dose 1 Day 1]. During the first year 
of treatment, the ADA test was conducted using the PK samples from the same visit. Additional sampling 
for ADAs was permitted at investigator’s or sponsor’s discretion (recorded as an unscheduled visit).

Anti-drug Antibody Assessment 
In the safety population, all subjects (96 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group and 49 subjects in 
the placebo treatment group) were evaluated for ADAs. Treatment-emergent ADAs against luspatercept 
were observed in the luspatercept treatment group at a lower incidence: 3 (3.1%) subjects developed 
binding antibodies as well as neutralizing antibodies. However, not all treatment-emergent ADAs 
appeared to be related to luspatercept treatment, as they were also observed in 3 (6.1%) subjects in the 
placebo treatment group. 
In the luspatercept treatment group, the maximum treatment-emergent ADA titer among subjects ranged 
from 11.5 to 92.0. All 3 subjects in the luspatercept treatment group with treatment-emergent ADA 
tested positive within 233 days of the first dose, and 2 subjects had positive samples for more than 2 
consecutive visits. 
Table 109: ADA measurements by parameter and positive category (safety population- 
subjects with ADA sample collected) 
Correlation of Antidrug Antibody versus Safety 
In ACE-536-B-THAL-002, all 6 subjects who tested positive for ADAs during treatment with the study 
drug reported at least 1 TEAE. All TEAEs reported in the 3 ADA-positive subjects during treatment in the 
luspatercept treatment group were reported as single incidents. Treatment-emergent AEs in the 3 ADA-
positive subjects during treatment in the placebo treatment group were each only reported in 1 subject, 
except for the event of pyrexia, which was reported in 2 of the 3 subjects. 
Hypersensitivity 
No systemic hypersensitivity reactions occurred in subjects who tested positive for ADA.

ACE536-04 
Method: ADAs were measured on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (baseline), Day 1 of Cycle 4, End of treatment (Day 
113 ± 7d) and on End of study (Day 141 ± 7d). If the subject had a positive ADA result at their last 
assessment, the subject was asked to return approximately every three months for additional testing 
until a negative result was obtained or the result was considered stabilised. 
Anti-drug Antibody Assessment 
Four subjects had a positive ADA result at baseline. Of these subjects, 1 remained positive throughout the 
study (subject rolled over to extension study ACE536-006 and confirmed negative on follow-up); 1 
became negative until the EOS visit, where the subject had a reportable ADA result of positive; and 2 
subjects had negative reportable ADA results after C1D1. No subjects who had a reportable ADA result of 
negative became positive during the study. 
ACE536-06 
Method: ADAs were measured on Day 1 of Cycle 1, on Day 1 of Cycle 5, Day 1 of Cycle 21 and on End of 
treatment. If the participant had a positive ADA result at their last assessment, the participant could be 
asked to return approximately every 3 months for additional testing, until a negative result was obtained 
or the result was considered stabilised. 
Anti-drug Antibody Assessment 
One participant had a reportable ADA result of positive at Cycle 1 Day1 (baseline; titer 736), which 
became negative at the subsequent visit and remained negative throughout the study; no participant had 
negative reportable results at baseline that subsequently became positive.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Given that drug-drug interactions generally do not occur with biologic agents, drug-drug interaction 
studies with luspatercept were not performed.

discontinuation by PT (safety population) 
•  Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction 
Pivotal Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
The proportion of subjects with TEAEs leading to dose reduction was higher in the luspatercept treatment 
group (10.4%; EAIR 6.4 per 100 subject-years) than in the placebo treatment group (0%; EAIR 0 per 
100 subject-years). The TEAEs leading to dose reduction reported in more than one subject in the 
luspatercept treatment group included bone pain in 4 subjects (4.2%) and hypertension in 3 subjects 
(3.1%). Arthralgia, dizziness, influenza-like illness, myalgia, nausea, and vision blurred occurred in 1 
subject each. All TEAEs that led to dose reduction were considered by the investigator to be treatment 
related. 
NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool (ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and A536-04/06 NTD Cohort) 
In the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool, the proportion of subjects with TEAEs leading to dose reduction was 
higher in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (11.6%; EAIR 6.4 per 100 subject-years) than in the 
placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (0%; EAIR 0 per 100 subject-years). The TEAEs 
leading to dose reduction reported in more than one subject in the pooled luspatercept treatment group 
included bone pain and hypertension in 4 (3.1%) subjects each; and headache and extramedullary 
hemopoiesis in 2 (1.6%) subjects each.

•  Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruption 
Pivotal Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 
The proportion of subjects with TEAEs leading to dose interruption in the luspatercept treatment group 
was similar to the placebo treatment group regarding the EAIR (24.0%; EAIR 15.2 per 100 subject-years 
vs 18.4%; EAIR 16.3 per 100 subject-years, respectively). 
The TEAEs leading to dose interruption reported in more than one subject in the luspatercept treatment 
group included hypertension in 6 (6.3%) subjects; pyrexia in 3 (3.1%) subjects; and bone pain, 
gastroenteritis, and traumatic fracture in 2 (2.1%) subjects each. In the placebo treatment group, 
pyrexia (3 [6.1%] subjects) was the only TEAE leading to dose interruption reported in more than one 
subject. 
NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool (ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and A536-04/06 NTD Cohort) 
Also in the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool, the proportion of subjects with TEAEs leading to dose 
interruption in the pooled luspatercept treatment group (23.3%; EAIR 13.6 per 100 subject-years) was 
similar to the placebo treatment group in Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 (18.4%; EAIR 16.3 per 100 
subject-years). 
The TEAEs leading to dose interruption reported in more than one subject in the pooled luspatercept 
treatment group included hypertension in 6 (4.7%) subjects; pyrexia in 3 (2.3%) subjects; and bone 
pain, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, pleural effusion and traumatic fracture in 2 (1.6%) subjects each. 
Post marketing experience 
Luspatercept was first approved for marketing in the US on 08 Nov 2019 for the treatment of anemia in 
adult patients with β-thalassemia who require regular RBC transfusions. Based on PSUR (Sequence No. 
0017), which covers the reporting period from 25 Jun 2020 to 24 Dec 2020, luspatercept is approved in 
33 countries. 
As of 24 Dec 2020, an estimated 6,886 patients were exposed to commercial luspatercept. 
The post-marketing safety profile of luspatercept in the β-thalassemia setting continues to be generally 
consistent with the clinical development program. Important identified risks with luspatercept as per EU 
Risk Management Plan (RMP), Version 1.5 are thromboembolic events specific in β-thalassemia 
population with splenectomy and EMH masses (in the TD and non-TD β-thalassaemia population). 
Important potential risks include hematologic malignancies (including AML), off label use in pediatric 
patients (developmental toxicity of luspatercept), use during pregnancy and lactation and bone fractures 
(in the non-TD β-thalassaemia population). The reports of these events remain consistent with findings 
from the β-thalassemia clinical development program and the overall safety profile of luspatercept. 
The post-marketing safety profile of luspatercept in the β-thalassemia setting continues to be consistent 
with the safety profile of luspatercept established in the other clinical development programs. Expected 
AEs are easily monitored and generally manageable. The identified and potential safety concerns can be 
mitigated by the relevant product information provided to health care professionals and patients as 
reflected in the RMP. All of these safety concerns are addressed in the planned pharmacovigilance 
actions. Risks are mitigated through the measures outlined in the RMP. The safety profile of luspatercept 
continues to be closely monitored, with particular attention to important identified and potential risks.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data in support of this extension of indication derive from one pivotal, placebo-controlled study 
(ACE-536-B-THAL-002) and two supportive open-label studies (A536-04 & A536-06). In the ISS, which 
forms the basis of the safety assessment, data are presented separately for the supportive studies and 
the pivotal study, respectively, and also pooled data are presented.  
In all safety tables presented, an overview is given of how many patients, also expressed as a percentage 
(%) of subjects, experienced certain TEAEs. Additionally, treatment-related TEAEs, Grade 3 and 4 AEs, 
SAEs, and AESIs were reported along with calculated events/n for each AE, which is acceptable.  
The pooled luspatercept group includes 129 subjects (A536-04 & A536-06, n=33; ACE-536-B-THAL-002, 
n=96). The mean treatment duration of the subjects in the supportive phase 2 studies (A536-04/-06) 
was 137.5 weeks, in the pivotal study (ACE-536-B-THAL-002) 94.0 weeks for luspatercept-treated and 
66.0 weeks for placebo-treated subjects. The majority of subjects treated with luspatercept (74.2%) 
received therapeutic doses for ≥ 18 months. Considering the rare nature of the disease as well as 
supportive safety data from already approved indications, the number of subjects with NTD β-thalassemia 
exposed to luspatercept seems adequate for the safety evaluation. 
Overall, the treatment duration appears adequate for assessing safety of a chronic treatment. However, 
the data cut-off for ACE-536-B-THAL-002 is 14 Sept 2020 and was the date the last subject completed 48 
weeks of study treatment (or had discontinued study drug before the end of the 48-week DBTP). At the 
initial data cut-off date, treatment with the study drug was ongoing for 84.4% of subjects in the 
luspatercept treatment group and 36.7% of subjects in the placebo treatment group. Updated data on 
SAEs and AESIs were submitted with responses (cut-off date of 22 Sep 2021). This represents 
approximately 12 months of additional data, which allows a more thorough assessment of the longer-
term effects of luspatercept. 
The mean age of the NTD β-thalassemia data pool is 39.3 years and only few subjects were ≥ 60 years 
old. In view of the limited number of subjects ≥ 60 years, the information that only limited data are 
available for β-thalassaemia patients ≥ 60 years has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. In the 
pivotal, placebo-controlled study, some differences were noted in co-morbidities at baseline between the 
treatment arms: Beside the splenectomy status (42.6% luspatercept arm vs 53.1% placebo arm, 
respectively), differences were observed in the PT of osteoporosis (23.3% vs 38.8%, respectively), 
thrombocytosis (15.5% vs 22.4%, respectively), and extramedullary hematopoiesis (13.2% vs 26.5%, 
respectively). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
Common TEAEs reported in ≥ 15% of subjects with a > 2% higher frequency for luspatercept than 
placebo were bone pain, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, myalgia, pharyngitis, upper respiratory 
tract infection, influenza, pyrexia, asthenia, diarrhoea, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, 
prehypertension, and hypertension whereas the most common TEAEs in the placebo treatment group 
were pyrexia, fatigue, and headache. The highest imbalances can be found in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (81.4% luspatercept arm vs 57.1% placebo arm).  
The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 2). 
Treatment-related adverse events 
In the luspatercept data pool, the subject incidence of AEs considered to be treatment-related was 77.5% 
[100/129 subjects] in the luspatercept group, and 36.7% [18/49 subjects] in the placebo group. The 
most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were bone pain (34.1% luspatercept and 2% placebo, 
respectively), back pain (16.3%, and 4.1%, respectively), arthralgia (17.8%, and 6.1%, respectively), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 220/245 
 
 
 
prehypertension (11.6%, and 10.2%, respectively) and hypertension (11.6%, and 0%, respectively), 
headache (16.3%, and 8.2%, respectively), and myalgia (10.9%, and 4.1%, respectively). The majority 
of treatment-related TEAEs had resolved as of the 14 Sep 2020 data cut-off date. The most frequently 
reported treatment-related TEAEs that had not resolved were prehypertension (7.0% of subjects) and 
hypertension (3.1%).  
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
The subject incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAEs was 27.9% in the luspatercept group 
compared to 24.5% in the placebo treatment group. After adjustment for exposure, the EAIR was lower 
for luspatercept treated patients (EAIR 18 vs 22.2 subject per year).  
The most commonly reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAE (at least 2% of patients) reported was traumatic fracture 
with 4 luspatercept treated subjects compared to 1 placebo treated subjects. Hereditary haemolytic 
disorders cause ineffective erythropoiesis and bone marrow hyperplasia. Little is known about their effect 
on growth and skeletal health, but chronic haemolysis may lead to impaired growth and bone health, 
even in young NTD patients. The degree of haemolysis determines bone health risk. As recently reported, 
correlations between different parameters revealed a potential role of osteocalcin, haemoglobin (Hb) and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as prognostic markers for bone health, in the setting of chronic haemolysis 
(Doulgeraki A et al. Hemoglobin. 2021). In this context, the higher rate of traumatic fracture was 
contextualized upon request. Traumatic fractures were mostly due to falls with no further circumstances 
reported. The majority of the subjects had a history of fractures, or concomitant diseases such as 
osteoporosis, osteopenia but the imbalance between treatment with luspatercept and placebo cannot be 
explained therewith alone. In this context, it is worth noting that, at baseline, higher incidences of both 
conditions have been reported as medical history in the placebo group and overall baseline measurement 
of BMD seemed comparable between groups. Furthermore, it remains uncertain how many accidental 
falls/road accidents occurred in the placebo arm without fractures, which preclude the conclusions that 
fractures occurred only due to accidents, as the proportion of accidents that resulted in fractures is 
unknown for both study arms. Taken together, an increased risk of traumatic fractures due to treatment 
cannot be ruled out based on the currently available data. This is especially of concern as many beta-
thalassaemia patients already suffer from osteoporosis or osteopenia. Since an early treatment before the 
onset of such co-morbidities would be envisaged, it is equally important to investigate whether there is an 
increased risk with treatment for the occurrence of fractures in patients not suffering from 
osteopenia/osteoporis at baseline. The baseline risk factors for the occurrence of fractures need to be 
further investigated. In addition, section 4.4 of the SmPC states that “In non-transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassaemia patients, traumatic fractures were observed in 8.3% (8/96) of patients treated with 
luspatercept. Patients should be informed of the risk of traumatic fracture.” It is also included as ADR in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC, further long term data are considered necessary. The MAH agreed to add 
fractures (traumatic and pathological) as Event Of Interest in the ongoing LTFU study, to present the data 
in future reports separately for TDT and NTDT patients and to explore potential risk factors for the 
occurrence of fractures related to luspatercept treatment (please see RMP).  
It is already known that the PTs Bone pain and Hypertension are related to luspatercept, but these TEAEs 
seem to be reported more frequently in NTDT patients than in TDT patients.  
Serious adverse events 
One death was reported in the NTD β-thalassemia Data Pool. The subject from the supportive study died 
of cardiac arrest (asystole), which is not considered related to luspatercept.  
SAEs occurred more frequently in the placebo treatment group (subject incidence 24.5%) than in the 
pooled luspatercept treatment group (10.1%). The difference was mainly driven by imbalances in SOC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 221/245 
 
 
 
infections and infestations, which occurred more frequently in placebo-treated patients (12.2% and 1.6%, 
respectively). 
The frequency of subjects who reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs and SAEs were comparable among the 0.6 to 
0.8 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 1.25 mg/kg dose level groups. In the 1.0 mg/kg dose group, slightly more 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction and TEAEs leading to dose interruption were observed, however a dose-
dependent increase in severe toxicity is not evident. 
Long-term data 
In the luspatercept treatment group, generally the highest incidence of the most frequently reported 
TEAEs (including bone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, upper respiratory tract 
infection, fatigue, influenza-like illness, headache, prehypertension, hypertension, and oropharyngeal 
pain) occurred during Cycles 1 through 4 (C1-C4) and was lower during each subsequent 4-cycle dosing 
interval. Long-term observations suggest that AEs did not increase significantly over time and were 
clinically manageable. This can be supported by the finding that only 2 subjects had to discontinue the 
study due to treatment-related TEAEs (in the pivotal study). Although the MAH clarified that all events 
reported in later intervals are newly reported cases, it is not evident whether the TEAEs reported at study 
beginning (C1-C4) resolved under luspatercept, were treated or were still ongoing. It is worrying that 
late-onset kidney injuries occurred under luspatercept administration (Cycle 21-24). Moreover, from an 
integrated analysis of the relationship between luspatercept serum exposure and the likelihood of 
hypertension, it appears that there is an increased risk of hypertension over time. Based on data provided 
by the MAH, this increased risk for hypertension events, however, seems to be limited to the first 8-12 
months of treatment. For further discussion of hypertension events please refer to the section below. 
Adverse events of special interest 
AEs of special interest included Malignancy, Premalignant disorder, EMH masses, Thromboembolic events, 
Kidney injury, Hypertension, and Muscoskeletal disorder-Bone Pain. The categories were selected based 
on non-clinical findings or clinical findings from the phase 2 and/or phase 3 studies of luspatercept in β-
thalassaemia and other indications. The choice of the AESIs is generally supported, but the AESI 
Hypersensitivity-type reactions was excluded, which should also be evaluated in the context of the AESIs.  
Hypersensitivity-type reactions were only reported for luspatercept-treated subjects (10.9% pooled 
luspatercept group vs 0.0% placebo). Events occurred as isolated cases with the exception of injection 
site erythema (5.2%) and facial oedema (3.1%). It is reassuring that no anaphylactic reactions have 
been reported. Upon request Hypersensitivity-type reactions were also included in SmPC section 4.8. 
The majority of AESIs occurred in the Muscoskeletal disorder-Bone pain category, in particular for events 
of back pain and bone pain. Events are already reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC, however it is 
noticeable that compared to the initial approval for TD-β thalassaemia patients, there has been a 
considerable increase in the number of EOIs for bone pain in this patient population of NTD-β 
thalassaemia patients (47.1% vs 67.7% of subjects, respectively) 
In the double-blind phase of the pivotal study, EMH masses were reported in 7 subjects in the 
luspatercept treatment group, including 1 subject with an EMH mass reported on Study Day 1, and 1 
subject in the placebo treatment group. During the open label portion of the study, EMH masses were 
observed in 2 additional patients for a total of 9/134 (6.7%) of patients while receiving luspatercept. Of 
note, no such events have been reported in studies submitted for the initial approval in TDT patients or 
MDS patients. However, with the Day120 responses, EMH mass events were also reported for the TDT 
population (ACE-536-B-THAL-001 and ACE-536-LTFU-001). Most events in the luspatercept arm were of 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity, considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug, and did not 
result in study drug discontinuation. However, it is noted that the EMH events did not resolve while the 
subjects were still receiving IP. One subject (with a previously stable EMH) developed a Grade 4 EMH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 222/245 
 
 
 
causing spinal canal compression that improved to Grade 2 after study drug discontinuation. The event 
was considered related by the investigator. The increased incidence in luspatercept-treated patients is of 
concern, as extramedullary haemopoiesis was observed more frequently in the placebo group at baseline 
(13.2% versus 26.5% subjects), but in the pooled NTD β thalassaemia patient population (including the 
double-blind phase of the pivotal study and NTD Cohort from supportive studies) there was an imbalance 
with 10 (7.8%) subjects (EAIR 4 per 100 subject-years) for luspatercept and only 1 (2%) subject (EAIR 
1.7 per 100 subject-years) for placebo. The development of extramedullary haematopoiesis during 
luspatercept therapy with a higher frequency of EMH in study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 in luspatercept 
patient as compared to placebo raises concern. An underlying MoA for EMH by luspatercept was not 
established, but data were reported from non-clinical findings where EMH was detected in lymph nodes in 
cynomolgus monkeys, which were considered a common background finding in cynomolgus monkeys at 
this age. Since no EMH events were reported in the control group, this argument is not fully conclusive, 
but given very low numbers (n=3 per sex per group), the observed absence of EMH masses in the control 
group may be a chance finding.  
In the meanwhile the MAH submitted an additional variation to update the SmPC for the existing 
indications to include information about EMH masses identified also in TDT and MDS patients. 
Consequently, and given the haematopoiesis stimulating properties of luspatercept, a causal relationship 
appears very likely and these EMH events are considered to be of particular concern. Further, it has been 
noted that 6 of the subjects who developed EMH masses while on luspatercept treatment were non-
responders with regard to the primary endpoint. The addition of EMH masses and spinal cord compression 
as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC and the inclusion of a respective warning in section 4.4 are 
supported. Further, concerns were raised for patients that are not only at risk for EMH masses, but 
already require treatment to control the growth of EMH masses. Therefore, the requirement for treatment 
to control the growth of EMH masses was included as contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
Nevertheless, based on the currently available data an increased risk for EMH masses with long term 
treatment cannot be excluded. As some aspects cannot be addressed in detail with the planned studies 
due to missing baseline data, further monitoring in the long term is required to address at least the 
potential risk increase. EMH masses are included in the RMP and will be followed up in the LTFU study. 
Together with the already included contraindication, warning and the stopping recommendation this is 
regarded as adequately addressed for the moment. In case an increased risk will be identified, this has to 
be re-evaluated. 
In the pivotal ACE-536-B-THAL-002 study, one thromboembolic event was reported after rolling over 
from placebo (0.7%). Two luspatercept-treated subjects experienced thromboembolic events in the 
supportive studies A536-04/06 (NTD Cohort). Both subjects were splenectomized and had additional 
relevant risk factors, hence both events were likely to be attributed to splenectomy. The warning for TDT 
patients in section 4.4 of the SmPC was extended to NTDT patients. 
A numerical imbalance of the AESI Kidney injury was observed in subjects treated with luspatercept. As 
of the initial data cut-off date, reported AESIs were classified by the MAH as Grade 1 or 2 severity, were 
not severe and resolved while subjects were still receiving IP. No acute kidney injury TEAEs (ie, PTs of 
renal failure, acute kidney injury, and renal impairment) were reported in any subject in the luspatercept 
or placebo treatment group. However, the AESI kidney injury increased to a total of 9 subjects (6.7%) 
after the initial data cut-off. Events were reported as not associated with prolonged or irreversible 
worsening of clinically important indicators of kidney function or injury. Upon request,  insufficient 
information was provided on the new cases, i.e. whether they were transient or persistent events, and 
the outcome of the events (resolved/not resolved) was left unanswered. As kidney events (single cases of 
blood creatinine increased, blood urea increased and proteinuria) were reported in later treatment cycles 
(21 and 24), a long-term effect cannot be excluded. Additionally, more cases of ACR shifts towards a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 223/245 
 
 
 
higher Grade were found after luspatercept administration. Consequently, kidney injury, proteinuria and 
albuminuria were added as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC upon request.  
Hypertension AESIs occurred more frequently in subjects treated with luspatercept (36.5%) compared 
with placebo (16.3%) in the pivotal study (data cut-off 22 Sept 2021). None of these events was serious 
or led to cardiovascular complications or IP discontinuation, and most of these events were Grade 1 or 2 
in severity. All Grade 3 events of hypertension were non-serious in nature, related to IP, resulted in dose 
reduction, and subsequently resolved to Grade 2 or lower. Few subjects had hypertension EOIs that led to 
dose reduction or interruption. Mean SBP and DBP were overall higher in the luspatercept treatment 
group compared to placebo. Increases from baseline of ≥ 20 mm Hg in SBP or DBP were observed only in 
the luspatercept treatment group, but not in the placebo group. SBP increase was more pronounced after 
long-term treatment with luspatercept, alongside a mean increase in SBP after extended exposure. 
Although most cases of hypertension were of mild severity, the frequency seems to be increased in 
comparison to data from TDT. As commented above, the risk for hypertension also appears to increase 
after 6 weeks of treatment. Based on the available data this increased risk persists for the first 8-12 
months of treatment. Overall, the increased risk for hypertension events is seen critical. The MAH 
considers these events as manageable with dose interruption/reduction and provided supporting data 
upon request. However, it is currently not clear whether these recommendations work in the long term. 
Further, several hypertension events are still ongoing or patients are on additional hypertension therapy. 
Also, no data is available whether long term treatment would result in further increase of blood pressure 
and subsequent further need for additional medication, or puts treated patients on increased CV risk in 
the long-term. In addition, statistically significant associations between hypertension events and age and 
exposure have been identified. Although age and exposure are highly confounded, a further increased risk 
for hypertension events with age cannot be excluded. These aspects can be addressed with the LTFU 
study and the MAH committed to additionally record and report whether hypertension events were 
addressed with dose interruptions/reductions or other treatments. 
One subject in the luspatercept treatment group had a non-serious colon adenoma (Grade 2) on Day 667. 
No action was taken with the study drug due to the event and the event resolved on the same day. The 
investigator considered the event to be not related to the study drug. This decision is acknowledged. No 
Malignancies are currently reported in the NTD β-thalassemia data pool. Although this is reassuring at 
present, it could be a consequence of the small number of patients and the short follow-up period (since 
the pivotal study is ongoing). There is still an uncertain risk related to malignancies, which is currently 
under investigation in the LTFU study for TD β-thalassaemia and MDS patients, for whom luspatercept 
has already been approved.  
Laboratory findings  
Overall, changes in haematology parameters appear within the range that can be expected after 
haematopoiesis-modifying treatment. However, Hb > 11.5 g/dL was observed considerably more 
frequently in the luspatercept group (36.4%) compared to placebo (2%), which may contribute to the 
overall risk of luspatercept. In addition, the incidence of Hb increase > 2 g/dL/3 weeks was 10% in Study 
ACE-536-B-THAL-002 and an hemoglobin increase does not appear to be a negligible problem. 
Moreover, all investigated parameters, except haemoglobin, were abnormal more frequently in the 
supportive studies A536-04/06 compared to the luspatercept group in the pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-
002 with a much shorter study duration. A shift of platelet counts 500 to < 1000 × 109/L at baseline to ≥ 
1000 × 109/L postbaseline was observed in more patients in the supportive studies (35%) compared to 
both treatment groups (11.1% and 20% in the luspatercept and placebo groups, respectively) in the 
pivotal study ACE-536-B-THAL-002. In line with this observation, EAIR of abnormal platelet counts were 
considerably higher in the supportive studies compared to both treatment groups in pivotal study ACE-
536-B-THAL-002, which might reflect the progression of the disease. 
Assessment report

Clinically relevant elevated liver parameters, i.e. patients potentially fulfilling Hy´s law were only 
observed in the luspatercept group (9 vs. 0). This finding was included in the SmPC upon request. 
Worsening by one grade in creatinine and eGFR was observed more frequently in the luspatercept group 
compared to placebo (creatinine: 5.4% vs 2.1%; eGFR: 21% vs 14.6%), and worsening by two grades 
was observed only in the luspatercept group (creatinine: 0.8%; eGFR: 1.6%). Hence, clinically significant 
abnormalities in eGFR were overall rare and no acute safety concerns arise from renal laboratory results. 
Yet, abnormalities increased after long-term treatment with luspatercept in supportive studies and a long-
term effect cannot be excluded. 
Overall, after long-term luspatercept treatment in supportive studies A536-04/06 elevation of liver and 
renal parameters became more pronounced, which may be of concern and are of unclear relevance 
regarding long term treatment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
All luspatercept treatment-related TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation were isolated cases. The 
rate of study discontinuations due to AEs was generally low across the clinical development program of 
luspatercept (2.1% of luspatercept-treated subjects vs 0% for placebo). 
Immunogenicity 
In the luspatercept treatment group, there were 3 (3.1%) subjects who were positive for treatment-
emergent antibodies to luspatercept following treatment initiation and all 3 subjects were positive for 
neutralizing antibodies against luspatercept. The low incidence of TE-ADAs observed in the NTD β-
thalassemia population was consistent with that previously reported for the TD β-thalassemia population 
(1.81%). Hypersensitivity reactions were not reported in any of the ADA-positive subjects, which is 
reassuring. The observed influence of either preexisting or treatment emergent anti-drug-antibodies on 
the safety profile of luspatercept appears limited and does not cause concern at the present time.  
During the first Periodic Safety Update Single Assessment (PSUSA) for luspatercept (data lock point: 24 
December 2020), the MAH reviewed the following safety concerns of thromboembolic events, 
malignancies, off-label use in paediatric patients/ use during pregnancy and lactation. No new significant 
information was identified. Regarding the missing information of long-term safety, there is an ongoing 
long-term follow-up study (ACE-536-LTFU-001) to evaluate the long-term safety including 
thromboembolic events (TEEs) (only in the β-thalassaemia subjects) and progression to AML and/or other 
malignancies/pre-malignancies. The second PSUSA for luspatercept had the data lock point 24 June 2021. 
Although no safety issues were reported by the MAH during the reporting interval, the PRAC considers 
that an EMH signal should be initiated and included as safety concern of the PSUR. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of luspatercept includes a variety of adverse events of special interest of which several 
resulted in warnings in the SmPC. The risk for EMH masses, traumatic fractures, hypertension, worsening 
of liver and kidney parameter, potential kidney damage and the unknown risk for malignancies are of 
special concern. Although most AEs have already been identified in the initial studies in transfusion 
dependent beta-thalassamia (TDT) patients, additional adverse events have been observed amongst 
those are traumatic fractures, EMH masses and kidney injuries and others were reported more frequently 
like hypertension and bone pain. In addition, several uncertainties regarding the long term safety of 
luspatercept have been identified, that cannot be addressed with the currently available data but with 
data from a LTFU study (please see RMP). Several amendments to the ongoing study have been 
implemented by the MAH to address these issues.  
Assessment report

The safety aspects have also been discussed by experts in an AHEG meeting. The experts concurred that 
the described safety aspects are non-negligible, but might be manageable temporarily with additional 
treatment or dose interruption/reduction. Nevertheless, the expert group considered that long term data 
are definitively required to address the uncertainties and improve the treatment strategy for the patients.  
Additional information on adverse reactions and recommendations for patient management have been 
introduced in the SmPC. An additional contraindication for “patients requiring treatment to control the 
growth of EMH masses” has also been added.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
The readability of the PL of Reblozyl (luspatercept), in English, was assessed during the 
assessment of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) according to the methods outlined in 
the European Commission’s guideline titled: A guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet 
of medicinal products for human use, Revision 1, 12 January 2009. The final report was then submitted to 
the EMA in December 2019 (Response to the List of Questions, original Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA)) as per EMA operational procedure guidance (EMEA/277378/2005). Reblozyl 
(luspatercept) was approved on 25 June 2020. 
• 
The new indication, which essentially includes the use of Reblozyl (luspatercept) for adult patients 
with non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia, that is hereby applied for concerns the same route of 
administration and has a similar safety profile as the previously approved indications (i.e., key safety 
messages for the existing and new applied for indication are largely the same). 
• 
Administration of Reblozyl (luspatercept) is done by a health care professional. The instructions 
for dose calculation, preparation, administration, storage and disposal are currently reflected in the 
approved PL. 
• 
• 
The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested one. 
Overall, the proposed leaflet shares large text sections with the reference one. The modifications 
now proposed in the PL (i.e., those relevant to the new indication) do not represent major changes. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is an extension of the current indication ´treatment of adult patients with 
transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with beta-thalassaemia` to include also non-transfusion 
dependent β-thalassaemia patients. 
The β-thalassaemias are a group of inherited disorders characterised by absent or reduced production of 
the β-globin chains of haemoglobin, the oxygen carrying molecule in human RBCs.  
Transfusion dependent (TD) β-thalassaemia refers to the most severe form of beta thalassemia in which 
there is minimal to no beta globin chain production and consequently little to no HbA and HbG, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 231/245 
 
 
 
 
then has to be externally substituted (by regular transfusions). Patients with TD β-thalassaemia (which 
includes conventional β-thalassaemia major and severe forms of HgbE/β-thalassaemia) commonly come 
to clinical attention in early childhood (before 2 years of age) with severe anaemia (< 7 g/dL); they 
require life-long, regular blood transfusion therapy.  
In contrast, patients with Non-transfusion dependent (NTD) β-thalassemia present later in childhood or 
adolescence with mild to moderate anaemia (Hb values of 11.9 – 8.0 g/dL for females and 11.0 – 8.0 
g/dL for males; WHO/NMH/NHD/MNM/11.1) without requiring regular RBC transfusion therapy for 
survival. However, NTD β-thalassemia patients still need transfusion therapy intermittently when low Hb 
levels are anticipated (eg, significant infection, surgery, or pregnancy) or even more frequently for limited 
periods of time to improve underlying anemia that may be negatively impacting growth and development 
in children or causing clinical morbidity such as splenomegaly, EMH pseudotumours, leg ulcers or low QoL 
(due to fatigue, tiredness, lack of energy, dyspnea, shortness of breath, etc) in adults (Musallam, 2021a; 
Cappellini, 2018). 
Patients with NTD β-thalassemia may also develop clinically significant iron overload irrespective of 
receiving transfusions. Ineffective erythropoiesis is suggested to lead to low hepcidin levels, resulting in a 
marked increase in intestinal iron absorption. Iron overload is a major cause of morbidity for patients with 
NTD β-thalassemia (Vichinsky, 2016). A rise in liver iron concentration (LIC) in NTD β-thalassemia has 
been proportionally associated with an increased risk of multiple complications, pulmonary hypertension, 
vascular disease, endocrinopathies, and osteoporosis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
NTD β-thalassemia is a condition of unmet medical need. The main available management options for 
NTD β-thalassemia patients are RBC transfusions, iron chelation therapy (ICT), prophylactic anticoagulant 
therapy, splenectomy, and foetal haemoglobin (HbF) induction (such as hydroxyurea). 
The only approved pharmacologic therapies in the US and EU for NTD β-thalassemia are iron chelating 
agents used for managing iron overload. Deferasirox (oral) is approved in the EU and US and 
deferoxamine (SC or intravenous [IV] administration) is approved in the EU.  
Vitamin B9 prophylaxis (more typically referred to as folate or folic acid) is given to prevent any 
occurrence of vitamin deficiency anemia.  
It is important to bear in mind that there is an available alternative treatment option (transfusion 
therapy), which is however only started if the need is sufficiently high, since risks associated with 
transfusion therapy (e.g., iron accumulation and subsequent liver/cardiac disease, or hypersensitivity 
reactions) as well as impairment on quality of life due to regular transfusions are considered to outweigh 
its direct effect on alleviating symptoms associated with anemia, while benefits in terms of prevention of 
co-morbidities in the long term are not known. The decision to use RBC transfusions would be taken 
based on balancing the benefits and risks considering each patient’s clinical condition (age, presence of 
comorbidities that, if left untreated, would put patients at risk of permanent damage) (Taher, 2017; 
Galanello, 2010). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study ACE-536-B-THAL-002 is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) versus placebo in adults with non-transfusion 
dependent beta (β)-thalassemia and a Hb level ≤10 g/dL (diagnosis of β-thalassemia or HbE/β-
thalassemia, with or without concomitant α-globin mutation and/or duplication). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 232/245 
 
 
 
Consenting subjects entered a 4-week screening period during which eligibility was assessed and 24 
weeks of RBC transfusion history and ICT was collected retrospectively, if applicable. Eligible subjects 
were randomized to luspatercept or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, using baseline Hb level (< 8.5 or ≥ 8.5 g/dL) 
and NTDT-PRO T/W (score ≥ 3 or < 3) as stratification factors. The study included a double-blind 
treatment period [48 weeks], and an open label treatment period [after week 48; subjects could enter to 
receive luspatercept for a maximum of 15 months]. A post-treatment follow-up period for up 5 years 
after the first dose of study drug or 3 years after the last dose (whichever occurs later) followed for 
subjects who discontinued study drug in the DBTP or OLP. Patients were allowed to roll-over into the 
overarching long term follow-up study LTFU-001. 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of luspatercept plus best supportive care 
(BSC) versus placebo plus BSC on anemia. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who had 
an increase from baseline ≥ 1.0 g/dL in mean of Hb values over a continuous 12-week interval from Week 
13 to Week 24 in the absence of transfusions. The study was unblinded after completion of the double-
blind treatment period for evaluation of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Efficacy assessments included Hb evaluation over time, Hb responder analyses evaluating a threshold of 
1.5 g/dL increase from baseline and analyses evaluated during weeks 37-48. Appropriate sensitivity 
analyses were provided for the primary and key secondary endpoints. Furthermore, QoL outcome tools 
(NTDT PRO T/W, NTDT PRO SoB, FACIF-F, SΒ6 MCS and PCS subdomains) as well as 6MWT evaluating 
functional exercise capacity were included as secondary measures, also evaluated up to week 48. The 
luspatercept effect on morbidities associated with β-thalassaemia such as iron overload, pulmonary 
function, osteoporosis and EMH masses were also assessed as exploratory outcome parameters. 
The ITT population of efficacy included 145 subjects (96 randomized to luspatercept plus BSC and 49 
randomized to placebo plus BSC). The study population included a heterogeneous patient population with 
and without anemia-related symptoms. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A consistent effect has been demonstrated on haemoglobin for the primary endpoint (increase of at least 
1 g/dL in Hb during weeks 13-24) as well as all secondary endpoints addressing haemoglobin change and 
also seen in most subgroups. 
When analysed according to baseline symptomatic score, among subjects with a baseline NTDT-PRO T/W 
domain score of ≥ 3 out of 10 (‘symptomatic’), the LS mean difference for luspatercept versus placebo 
was -0.73 (95% CI: -1.48, 0.03). Results for the FACIT-F evaluation (score <43) are in line with the 
results observed for the NTDT PRO T/W. 
There is some evidence from published literature data that supports the clinical benefit of increasing Hb 
levels in NTDT B-Thalassaemia patients, based on cross-sectional or retrospective studies. In these 
studies, higher Hb levels at baseline were shown to be associated with a lower risk of co-morbidity 
development and mortality, while lower Hb levels at baseline were associated with more unfavourable 
outcomes in β-thalassaemia patients.  
Further support may be derived from other secondary endpoints such as SF-36, FACIT-F or the 6MWT, 
where at least no detrimental (mean) effect for the overall population comparing luspatercept and 
placebo groups have been observed.  
Longer term data suggest a durable Hb response among subjects with prolonged Luspatercept treatment.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Haemoglobin: Splenectomised subjects showed an overall lower Hb response compared to non-
splenectomised subjects. For the primary endpoint (mean haemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.0 mg/dL from 
baseline to Week 13-24), the treatment effect of luspatercept over placebo was 55.9% versus 88.7%, 
respectively, among splenectomised subjects compared to non-splenectomised subjects. For the 
secondary endpoint ‘Mean Hb change from baseline’ (week 13-24), mean Hb was 1.09 vs. 1.53 g/dL 
among splenectomised subjects and non-splenectomised subjects, respectively, compared to placebo.   
QoL: With regards to Quality of Life data, the questionnaires have been adequately validated. Results in 
terms of NTDT PRO T/W and SoB are undermined by the fact that phase 2 data were used to confirm the 
validity/reliability of the PRO, limiting its interpretability as a confirmatory parameter. It should be further 
noted that the Fatigue FS is also not specifically validated for the NTDT population. For the mean change 
from baseline in NTDT-PRO T/W domain score over a continuous 12-week interval from Week 13 to Week 
24; no statistically significant effect has been demonstrated (LS mean difference for luspatercept versus 
placebo -0.48 (95%CI: -1.03, 0.08). Discrepant results were observed comparing symptomatic and 
asymptomatic patients. Further inconsistent NTDT T/W PRO results have also been observed across 
several other subgroup analyses e.g. when subjcts are classified by their Hb baseline level, subjects with 
compared to without splenectomy). The results on the FACIT- Fatigue subscale do not give reassurance 
as to a compelling luspatercept treatment effect on symptom improvement. The meaningfulness of the 
observed small effects in terms of QoL/functional capacity evaluated by other secondary outcome 
measures (SF-36 and 6MWT) is also not clear. 
Surrogacy of Hb increase of 1g/dL is not established: While the provided publications indicate an 
association of lower Hb levels at baseline in NTD B-thalassaemia patients with a more unfavourable 
outcome (in terms of co-morbidity/mortality risk) after ten years of follow-up as compared to patients 
with lower Hb levels at baseline, these studies were of small sample sizes and present important 
methodological flaws and confounding effects cannot be ruled out. Further, the impact of Hb level 
variations over time on the co-morbidity risk has not been investigated so far. In addition, there is no 
study that analysed the magnitude of effect on Hb increase (due to intervention) that would be needed to 
result in a certain co-morbidity risk reduction. Additional efficacy data will be provided as part of the LFTU 
follow-up study (please see RMP). 
Patients with clinically significant iron overload: Approximately 37.0% of the study population was having 
a clinically significant iron overload at baseline (> 800 μg/L Serum Ferritin or LIC > 5 Fe/g dw), while 
roughly 30% of subjects received ICT at baseline as well as around 40% during the study. Results in 
terms of iron parameters do not indicate a significant effect of luspatercept compared to placebo. For LIC 
at week 48 and LIC/ICT responders at week 24 and 48, even a larger effect in the placebo group is 
evident, which the MAH possibly attributes to the greater proportion of placebo-treated subjects receiving 
concomitant deferasirox compared with the luspatercept-treated subjects (30.6% versus 24.0%, 
respectively). 
RBC Transfusion requirements: Only a low number of patients were not transfusion-free at baseline, i.e., 
only approximately 14% of subjects received transfusions within 24 weeks before randomisation. Of note, 
it is not known how this distributes between ‘symptomatic’ and ‘asymptomatic’ patients, as reasons for 
transfusions were not collected and might also have been due to infection or surgery, while being 
otherwise asymptomatic.  
Data regarding transfusion need were only documented for 24 weeks before randomisation, thus, 
representativeness of the baseline transfusion need and comparability between treatment groups in terms 
of longer term transfusion data cannot be confirmed. A rather unexpected increase from baseline in RBC 
transfusions during the double-blind phase in the placebo group may raise the question as to whether in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 234/245 
 
 
 
the placebo group a potentially more severely affected patient population could have been included as 
compared to the luspatercept group (a stable transfusion count over longer time periods would have been 
expected during the one year double-blind treatment). 
Reasons for transfusions administered before randomisation were not provided, thus it cannot be followed 
whether in Luspatercept patients who received transfusions at baseline but not during the studies were 
truly attributable to Luspatercept or rather to a lack of similar triggers (e.g. infection, surgery). It can 
therefore not be concluded with sufficient certainty that the observed effect was truly attributable to 
Luspatercept treatment. 
In addition, the potential for functional unblinding needs to be highlighted, considering the robust Hb 
response in Luspatercept patients only and that decision criteria to transfuse were subjective. This may 
have differently affected the decision to transfuse between both treatment groups. 
Lastly, a substantial proportion of the population remained transfusion-free throughout the study and in 
these patients, the benefit in terms of transfusions remains unknown, i.e., whether and to what extent 
transfusions would be avoidable over time with treatment.  
Patients with concomitant co-morbidities such as EMH pseudotumours, leg ulcers, osteoporosis, 
pulmonary hypertension: No clear benefit could be observed up to 48 weeks of luspatercept compared to 
placebo treatment in terms of improvement of co-morbidities. For EMH masses, even a potential 
detrimental effect might be suggested by the data, albeit based on a small number of patients only (see 
also safety section). An insufficient number of patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, liver 
or kidney disease was included to allow any conclusions in these patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
100% of subjects in the pooled luspatercept treatment group and 98.0% of subjects in the placebo 
treatment group reported at least 1 TEAE. Incidence rates of TEAEs of Grade 3 or 4, TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction, and treatment-related TEAEs leading to IP discontinuation, were higher in the pooled 
luspatercept treatment group than in the placebo treatment group. 
Common TEAEs reported in ≥ 15% of subjects with a > 2% higher frequency for luspatercept than 
placebo were bone pain, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, diarrhoea, pharyngitis, oropharyngeal 
pain, cough, prehypertension, essential hypertension/hypertension/hypertensive crisis, headache, and 
influenza like illness.  
The most commonly reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAE (at least 2% of patients) reported was traumatic fracture 
with 4 (4.2%) luspatercept treated subjects compared to 1 (2%) placebo treated subjects in the pivotal 
study. In the luspatercept group, 3 had reported osteoporosis (47- and 60-year old females) or 
osteopenia (44-year old male) at baseline while only one patient did not present baseline BMD 
abnormalities (47-year old female). The patient in the placebo group (55-year old female) had 
osteoporosis at baseline. Given the overall higher frequencies of osteoporosis and osteopenia at baseline 
in the placebo group (38.8% and 61.2%, respectively) compared to luspatercept (25.0% and 45.8%, 
respectively), the observed imbalance of traumatic fractures is of concern and occurred as newly 
identified safety signal of luspatercept. 
The performed exposure response analysis showed a statistically significant association with increased 
luspatercept AUCevent and bone pain/arthralgia ≥ Grade 1 in Week 1 to 6 and hypertension ≥ Grade 1 in 
Week 1 to 48 with increasing incidence over time. In the analysis age was associated with both TEAE 
showing that older subjects are more likely to experience these TEAEs. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs):  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 235/245 
 
 
 
EMH masses were more frequently reported in the luspatercept treated subjects (n=9, 6.7%) than in the 
placebo treatment group (n=1, 2.1%). EMH events did not resolve while the subjects were still receiving 
IP. One subject in the luspatercept treatment group experienced a Grade 4 SAE of spinal cord 
compression as the result of a pre-existing paravertebral EMH mass. Based on the observed cases in 
NTDT patients, an association between the use of luspatercept and EMH masses is very likely. The initially 
submitted data for this variation only included cases in NTDT patients, however, respective cases have 
also been observed in TDT and MDS patients, however with lower incidences (data submitted in a parallel 
variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/004444/II/0011)). The observation of EMH masses have been addressed 
in section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Kidney injury was reported in 6.7% of luspatercept treated subjects and 0% of placebo treated subjects, 
and newly occurring kidney injury EOIs proteinuria (3/134 [2.2%]) and albuminuria (4/134 [3.0%]) were 
observed after extended treatment in the luspatercept group (vs 0 in placebo). 
Regarding hepatic and renal laboratory parameters, a trend towards overall elevated liver enzymes as 
well as bilirubin values over time was observed in patients treated with luspatercept. Patients potentially 
fulfilling Hy´s law were only seen in the luspatercept group, but not in the placebo group (7% vs. 0%). 
Also, worsening by one grade in creatinine and eGFR was observed more frequently in the luspatercept 
group compared to placebo (creatinine: 5.4% vs 2.1%; eGFR: 21% vs 14.6%). Worsening by two grades 
was observed only in the luspatercept group (creatinine: 0.8%; eGFR: 1.6%). 
Hypertension occurred more frequently in subjects treated with luspatercept (29.1%) compared with 
placebo (16.3%). An increased risk for hypertension events was observed within the first 12 months of 
treatment. The most frequently reported hypertension-related AE was the preferred term of hypertension 
(19.8% and 2.0% of subjects in the luspatercept and placebo treatment group, respectively). The 
frequency seems to be increased in comparison to data from TDT patients. Luspatercept is associated 
with a mean increase in SBP and DBP of about 5 mm Hg from baseline. A warning in section 4.4 together 
with recommendations on dose adjustment in section 4.2 of the SmPC is addressing this risk. 
The proportion of subjects with musculoskeletal disorder-bone pain was higher in the luspatercept 
treatment group (67.2%) than in the placebo treatment group (32.7%). The main drivers were bone 
pain, back pain and pain in extremity. 
The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in NTDT patients receiving Reblozyl (at least 15% 
of patients) were bone pain, headache, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, prehypertension, and 
hypertension. 
SAEs occurred in 13.4% of patients treated with luspatercept and in 26.5% of patients treated with 
placebo. The most commonly reported SAEs were traumatic fractures in the luspatercept group, reported 
by 5 (3.9%) patients compared to one (2%) patient in the placebo control group. A treatment-related 
SAE was reported for one (1.0%) subject in the luspatercept treatment group (PT: spinal cord 
compression). 
One luspatercept-treated subject from the supportive studies had Grade 5 (fatal) TEAE during the study 
and died of cardiac arrest (asystole). The TEAE was not considered related to luspatercept. 
Overall, 2 (2.1%) luspatercept-treated patients but no placebo-treated patients experienced treatment-
related adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation (one case each of arthralgia, extramedullary 
haemopoiesis, haemolytic anemia, lupus-like syndrome and spinal cord compression).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Evaluation of comparative safety against placebo from the pivotal phase 2 study is limited by a 
considerably shorter duration of exposure for placebo patients (48 weeks). Safety follow-up data is 
available for approx. 150 weeks (median) for 96 NTDT patients.  
The reported incidences for EMH masses might be underestimated, since based on the study procedures, 
it cannot be assumed that all EMH masses that occurred during the studies were detected, as most of 
them remain asymptomatic. MRI scans for EMH masses were only performed at baseline (and week 48) 
in subjects with a history of masses. Consequently also pre-existing masses cannot be excluded.  
6 of the 9 subjects who developed EMH masses while on luspatercept in the ACE-536-B-THAL-002 study 
were non-responders with regard to the primary endpoint. 
Data submitted for a variation procedure for the approved indications, show also EMH masses in TDT and 
MDS patients, that were previously not detected. Consequently an increased risk for EMH masses over 
time cannot be ruled out. 
The imbalance of traumatic fractures is considered a cause for concern, especially since the baseline 
medical history indicates lower incidences of osteoporosis in the treatment group. In addition, slightly 
lower mean T-scores (hip/spine) were measured by DXA scan at baseline in the placebo group 
(Luspatercept: mean hip T-score -0.77, mean spine T-score: -1.61; placebo: mean hip T-score: -1.08, 
mean spine T-score: -1.79). Of note, overall, a substantial proportion of subjects did not show 
osteoporosis or osteopenia at baseline or during the study. BMD was measured at week 48 and no 
notable change has been observed in T-scores within one year of treatment with Luspatercept or in the 
placebo group. In addition, it remains uncertain how many accidental falls/road accidents happened in the 
placebo arm without fractures precluding the conclusions that fractures occurred due to accidents only as 
the proportion of accidents resulting in fractures is unknown for both study arms.  
Although an increased risk for hypertension events was only observed within the first 12 months of 
treatment, currently it is not clear whether the events resolved due to dose modifications (interruption or 
reduction), with additional anti-hypertension medication or by themselves. In addition, statistically 
significant associations between hypertension events and age and exposure have been identified, which 
are however highly confounded. However, a further increased risk for hypertension events with age 
cannot be excluded. 
It is not known whether newly occurring events of AESI/EOI kidney injury (during the open-label phase) 
were transient or persistent events, whether they resolved or whether they were considered related to 
Luspatercept. Additional safety data will come from the LFTU study (please see RMP). 
In contrast to TD β-thalassaemia and MDS patients, no malignancies are reported for luspatercept during 
the placebo controlled study phase, but this may be a consequence of the small number of patients and 
the short follow-up period. There is still an uncertain risk related to malignancies, which is currently under 
investigation in the LTFU study for TD β-thalassaemia and MDS patients, for whom luspatercept has 
already been approved. 
Similarly, the risk for thrombotic events is currently unclear for NTD patients, but has been observed in 
TD β-thalassaemia and MDS patients. Although the risk for thrombotic events might be lower in NTD 
patients, it cannot be neglected given their overall hypercoagulable state. Further investigation that 
luspatercept (long term) treatment is not associated with a higher risk of thrombosis is also needed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The unmet medical need in the NTD B-Thalassaemia patient population is recognised, as there are limited 
therapeutic options in this population, i.e., iron chelation, splenectomy and transfusion strategies, the 
latter being limited due to the risk of alloimmunization. As, based on published literature, patients with 
lower Hb levels seem to be more likely to develop downstream manifestations of the disease (named ‘co-
morbidities’) such as iron overload/hepatic disease, hypercoagulability, leg ulcers, pulmonary 
hypertension, EMH masses, splenomegaly or osteoporosis, safe and effective treatment options are 
needed that would be able to reduce this co-morbidity risk.  
Unfortunately, such effect remains unknown for luspatercept, as no effect on co-morbidities has been 
observed in the BEYOND study, which was of only 48 week double blind treatment duration, and it cannot 
be quantified based on available data, as patient-level surrogacy has not been established for Hemoglobin 
(Hb) increase.  
A consistent treatment effect on Hb levels compared to placebo and best standard of care (BSC) has been 
shown (primary and key secondary Hb-related endpoints). However, mean increase in Hb of around 1 to 
1.5 g/dL is no established surrogate for the prediction of long term outcome in NTD β-thalassaemia. The 
meaningfulness of the observed Hb effects is therefore difficult to interpret, in particular on a patient 
group level and this is further complicated by the large heterogeneity in the population studied in terms 
of clinical phenotype/disease severity, e.g. reflected by different baseline Hb levels or anemia-related 
symptoms.  
An expert panel that was asked during the procedure whether they would consider the efficacy results 
from the BEYOND study of clinical benefit to the investigated patient population took the view that the 
observed Hb increase from baseline of 1-1.5g/dL in (symptomatic) NTDT patients can be considered a 
clinical benefit to the patient based on the following assumptions:  
a) 
b) 
Expected improvement of quality of life symptoms 
Expected improvement of in morbidity or mortality  
Although there is evidence from published literature that low Hb levels at baseline were associated with 
co-morbidities in a cohort of ß-thalassaemia patients followed over ten years, this needs yet to be 
confirmed as the available data carry important limitations due to small sample sizes and retrospective 
study design, Hb variations over time were not evaluated and there is no available interventional study 
that could confirm and quantify the reduced risk for co-morbidities by increasing Hb levels with 
intervention. It also remains open whether even a certain Hb threshold would need to be exceeded to be 
able to reduce the co-morbidity risk to a relevant extent.  
Nevertheless, it may be reasonable to assume that an increase of Hb levels will have a positive impact on 
the course of disease based on the available evidence.  
Based on the lack of surrogacy of mean Hb increase and the PRO results and the issues raised during the 
evaluation; the MAH had proposed to restrict the target population to patients with presence of anemia-
related symptoms, as in these, improvement of symptoms may be more plausibly expected and an 
increased trend of an improvement would be evident in this patient group in the study. According to MAH, 
this patient population would be adequately represented by classification of their NTDT PRO T/W baseline 
score of ≥3 (out of 10 possible points).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 240/245 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding the clinical meaningfulness of the Hb effect and the failure of the study to show interpretable 
QoL results, the consulted ad hoc expert group (AHEG) commented that it may overall be difficult to 
capture a significant improvement in symptoms in a study in this patient population, as patients are often 
well adapted to their anemia-related symptoms and it may be difficult to show relevant changes in the 
study due to treatment. 
It should however be noted that, when focusing on the symptomatic only patients in whom an 
improvement in symptoms may be more readily expected, the observed effects in symptom improvement 
also remains largely non interpretable (validity issues of the PROs taken aside). Focusing on a subgroup 
rather than on the broader patient population was found to introduce additional uncertainties related to 
e.g. the data driven look at the data, the small sample size, the identified imbalances between treatment 
groups at baseline with unclear impact on the results and, lastly, the lack of validation of the PRO based 
on which the relevance of symptom improvement has been justified by the MAH. There is no concrete 
definition that concisely defines a ‘symptomatic’ patient population (i.e. that presents with anemia-related 
symptoms), as was agreed with by the AHEG. Furthermore, considering that increasing Hb levels is 
indeed considered a relevant target based on the experts’ view, who also expect a Hb increase to have 
positive impact on morbidity and mortality in the long-term, a restriction to symptomatic patients was 
ultimately not considered justified by the CHMP. Even if there is no observed immediate benefit such as 
improvement of anemia-related symptoms, an improvement in terms of risk for co-morbidity 
development may be presumed in the overall population (NTD beta-thalassaemia patients with Hb≤10 
g/dL) based on plausibility considerations, albeit not quantified in the present study, and as such, the 
observed Hb increase compared to placebo may be considered a clinical benefit per se to the patient.  
With regard to transfusion-related endpoints, results are associated with considerable uncertainty and, 
although the transfusion-related endpoints show a favourable effect for luspatercept-treated patients, it 
seems impossible to conclude with certainty whether this effect is truly attributable to treatment or due to 
other reasons unrelated to treatment. In addition, it needs to be kept in mind that a substantial 
proportion of the population remained transfusion-free throughout the study and in these patients, it 
remains unknown whether and to what extent transfusions would be avoidable with treatment and for 
how long three-weekly applications would be needed to achieve an effect that outweighs the risks 
associated with the product. Results can therefore not be easily transferred to the entire study 
population. It should also be noted that most patients receiving a transfusion during the study had Hb 
levels below 8.5 g/dL and, again, it remains open how results are transferrable to less severely affected 
patients.  
The safety profile of luspatercept includes a variety of adverse events of special interest of which several 
resulted in warnings in the SmPC. Some are of special concern and are discussed in more detail below. 
Although most AEs have already been identified in the initial studies in transfusion dependent beta-
thalassamia (TDT) patients, additional adverse events have been observed, amongst those are traumatic 
fractures, EMH masses and kidney injuries. Others were reported more frequently, like hypertension and 
bone pain. In addition, several uncertainties regarding the long term safety of luspatercept have been 
identified that require further follow up in the post marketing. (LFTU study, please see RMP). Details are 
discussed below. The safety aspects addressed below have also been discussed by experts in an AHEG 
meeting. The experts concurred that the described safety profile is non-negligible, but might be 
manageable at least temporarily with additional treatment or dose interruption/reduction. Nevertheless, 
the expert group considered that long term data are definitively required to address the uncertainties and 
improve the treatment strategy for the patients.  
EMH masses are known to occur in beta-thalassemia patients due to their ineffective erythropoiesis. 
Since luspatercept is supposed to improve erythropoiesis, the observed increase in EMH masses is 
concerning. Further, it has been noted that 6 of the 9 subjects who developed EMH masses while on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 241/245 
 
 
 
 
 
luspatercept treatment were non-responders with regard to the primary endpoint. While pre-existing 
masses cannot be excluded due to missing baseline screening, the increased incidence rate in the 
luspatercept group in NTDT patients and reports of further cases after longer treatment in TDT or MDS 
patients may hint at a causal relation between luspatercept treatment and the occurrence of EMH masses 
also after long term treatment. These findings raise the question how this risk will evolve over time not 
only for patients without EMH masses at baseline, but also in patients with pre-existing EMH masses, as 
they may increase in volume over time.  
Consequenty, recommendations for baseline screening and regular monitoring for EMH masses were 
included in section 4.4. of the SmPC, which was strongly supported by the AHEG. In addition, section 4.4 
of the SmPC includes an adequate warning that treatment with luspatercept must be discontinued in case 
of serious complications due to EMH masses. Further, concerns are raised for patients that are not only at 
risk for EMH masses, but already require treatment to control the growth of EMH masses. A respective 
contraindication has been added to the SmPC. Based on the currently available data an increased risk for 
EMH masses with long term treatment cannot be excluded. As some aspects cannot be addressed in 
detail with the planned studies due to missing baseline data, further monitoring in the long term is 
required. EMH masses are included in the RMP and will be followed up in the LTFU study. Together with 
the contraindication, warning and the stopping recommendation, this is regarded as adequately 
addressed for the moment.  
The increased risk for hypertension events is also seen critical. Although the MAH claims that these 
events can be managed with dose interruption/reduction and respective recommendations have been 
implemented, it is currently not clear whether i) these recommendations work (in the long term) and ii) 
whether they were applied to the reported events or whether additional medication was used. Further, 
several hypertension events are still ongoing and it is not clear whether attempts were made to treat 
those patients accordingly. Also, no data is available whether long term treatment would result in further 
increase of blood pressure and subsequent further need for additional medication, or puts treated 
patients on increased CV risk in the long-term. In addition, statistically significant associations between 
hypertension events and age and exposure have been identified, which are however highly confounded. 
Nevertheless, a further increased risk for hypertension events with age cannot be excluded. These 
aspects can be addressed with the LTFU study. In order to provide useful data the MAH will additionally 
record whether hypertension events will be addressed with dose interruptions/reductions or other 
treatments. In the SmPC, there is an adequate warning in section 4.4 together with recommendations on 
dose adjustment, addressing this risk. 
In addition to the previously known adverse events, an increased incidence of traumatic fractures has 
been observed. The occurrence of traumatic fractures may have been partially favoured by pre-existing 
osteoporosis/osteopenia, but the imbalance between treatment with luspatercept and placebo cannot be 
explained therewith alone. It is worth noting that, at baseline, higher incidences of both conditions have 
been reported as medical history in the placebo group and overall baseline measurement of bone mineral 
density seem largely comparable between groups. Taken together, an increased risk of traumatic 
fractures due to treatment cannot be ruled out based on the currently available data. This is especially of 
concern as many beta-thalassaemia patients already suffer from osteoporosis or osteopenia. Since an 
early treatment before the onset of such co-morbidities would be envisaged, it is equally important to 
investigate whether there is an increased risk with treatment for the occurrence of fractures in patients 
not suffering from osteopenia/osteoporosis at baseline. The baseline risk factors for the occurrence of 
fractures need to be further investigated. Although the risk for fractures is considered acceptable at this 
stage, considering the overall low number of events observed and the inclusion as ADR in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC, further long term data are needed. In case an increased risk is observed over time, this may 
impact on the benefit risk balance. Fractures (traumatic and pathological) are added as Event Of Interest 
in the ongoing LTFU study. The data should be presented in future reports for TDT and NTDT patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 242/245 
 
 
 
 
 
separately. If possible, risk factors for the occurrence of fractures related to luspatercept treatment 
should be explored.  
During the long term open-label phase, events of kidney injury and related laboratory values were 
observed, which have not been reported previously in Luspatercept-treated patients or in the placebo 
group. Kidney injury is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and in the RMP as identified risk and is 
consequently further investigated post marketing. 
It is of note that a trend towards overall elevated hepatic and renal laboratory parameters over time 
was observed in patients treated with luspatercept. The implications for patients with pre-existing more 
severe hepatic and renal impairment are unknown, since those patients were not included in the 
submitted studies. It would for example be worrisome if hepatically impaired patients showed a further 
deterioration of their liver disease due to Luspatercept treatment. This is especially important with a view 
on the risk of iron overload in this patient population, which will lead to hepatic impairment. These 
aspects could however be addressed in the post marketing setting also with regular monitoring in the 
LTFU study.  
In contrast to TD β-thalassaemia and MDS patients, no malignancies are reported for luspatercept 
during the placebo controlled study phase, but this may be a consequence of the small number of 
patients and the short follow-up period. There is still an uncertain risk related to malignancies, which is 
currently under investigation in the LTFU study for TD β-thalassaemia and MDS patients, for whom 
luspatercept has already been approved. This will also need further follow-up in the long term in NTD 
patients. 
In summary, several adverse events have been identified that are of concern. While most might be 
manageable at least in the short term by additional treatments or dose adjustments, they will require 
additional regular monitoring and it is not known whether the recommended dose adjustments indeed 
resolve those events and/or might reduce the treatment effect, since no data has been provided in that 
respect. This will be addressed within the ongoing LTFU study. In their response to the major objection, 
the MAH has acknowledged the limitations associated with the single arm design of the ACE-536-LTFU-
001 study. To circumvent this limitation, and in order to establish a benchmark for the key clinical and 
safety endpoints for luspatercept subjects in the long term follow up study, literature data focusing on the 
natural disease progression will be systematically reviewed in thalassemia patient population. Parameters 
of interest will include disease progression including complications, RBC transfusion requirements, 
morbidity-free survival, quality of life assessments and iron parameters. Historical data sources such as 
electronic health records, claims or registries will also be considered to put the long-term follow up data 
in context. The respective analysis has to be thoroughly documented a priori to ensure unbiased results.  
The lack of long term data has also been highlighted as a limitation by the expert group as outlined in 
their responses. Consequently, the collection of additional data, in particular, appropriate long term data 
and regular monitoring is required to further investigate the risk of fractures or EMH masses. 
Furthermore, it needs to be investigated whether observed AEs such as hypertension, renal or hepatic 
impairment would increase or worsen in severity with long term treatment. The risk for thrombotic events 
or malignancies with long term treatment should also be investigated. The MAH has already amended the 
ongoing LTFU to address these issues. The LTFU is included as category 3 study in the RMP.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clear effect on Hb levels was demonstrated, although there are remaining uncertainties as regards its 
impact on long term outcome in terms of co-morbidity risk reduction. Also, a direct and immediate 
patient benefit has not been observed in the study beyond Hb increase, as QoL data are not considered 
sufficiently interpretable and also may not be anticipated for all treated patients considering the large 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023 
Page 243/245 
 
 
 
 
 
heterogeneity of the NTDT patient population in whom not all are (relevantly) affected by anemia-related 
symptoms.  
However, based on plausibility considerations and the available evidence that shows a correlation 
between lower Hb levels and higher co-morbidity risk, and under the premise of a manageable safety 
profile, this may ultimately not preclude approval.  
As regards safety, overall, there is residual uncertainty as to the (long term) risk profile of luspatercept. 
Taking into account the expert group’s view on the manageability of the safety profile (and additional 
amendments to the SmPC wording), the observed non-negligible safety profile may ultimately be judged 
acceptable for the time being, bearing in mind the unmet medical need.  
Residual uncertainty can be addressed within the ongoing LTFU study, which was requested as a category 
3 PASS.  
The indication was requested to be amended as follows:  
“Reblozyl is indicated in adults for the treatment of anemia associated with transfusion dependent and 
non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia (see section 5.1)”. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Reblozyl for this extension of indication is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
C.I.6 (Extension of indication) 
Extension of indication in β-thalassaemia to include adult patients with non-transfusion dependent β-
thalassaemia (NTDT) for Reblozyl; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.5 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/71817/2023

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IID and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Zynteglo was withdrawn by virtue of the 
“Commission Implementing Decision of 24.3.2022 withdrawing, at the holder's request, the conditional 
marketing authorisation granted by Decision C(2019) 4181(final) for "Zynteglo - betibeglogene 
autotemcel", an orphan medicinal product for human use”. Further to the withdrawal of the marketing 
authorisation, the market exclusivity of Zynteglo expired.  
The CHMP maintains it previous opinion, as applicable, that Reblozyl is not similar to Zynteglo within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000. (The previous opinion of the CHMP was 
adopted on 30 April 2020 in the context of the assessment of the marketing authorisation application for 
Reblozyl. In this respect, see: CHMP assessment report for Reblozyl of 30 April 2020 
(EMA/270924/2020), pages 11 and 193.) 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

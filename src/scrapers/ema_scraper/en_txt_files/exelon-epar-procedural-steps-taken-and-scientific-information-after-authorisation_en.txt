Update of SmPC section 4.8 based on safety data 
from studies (D2344, D1301) in the Asian 
population. Furthermore, sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC are updated in order to harmonise the dosing

Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic

necessary. 
Section 4.2 of the oral formulations SmPCs has also been

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to 
moderate renal or hepatic impairment. However, due to 
increased exposure in these populations, dosing 
recommendations to titrate according to individual

Product Information with additional side effects which have 
been reported post-marketing with Exelon transdermal 
patches: High blood pressure, application site allergic 
reaction, itching, rash, skin reddening, itchy rash, blisters, 
skin inflammation, fast heart beat, irregular heart beat, 
severe upper stomach pain, fall, convulsion, worsening of 
Parkinson disease (tremor, stiffness, shuffling) and 
hallucinations. Some of these events had already been 
reported with the oral formulations (Exelon capsules and 
oral solution). 
For all formulations, the  product information was updated 
with information on generalised skin reactions.  
The Product information was also been updated to raise 
awareness regarding misuse and dosing errors with the 
patch formulation which could expose patients to an 
excessive amount of this medicine. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to correct minor 
linguistic errors and to update all annexes in all languages

With this variation the MAH submitted a new version of the 
Pharmacovigilance system (DDPS). 
Update of DDPS (Pharmacovigilance) 
DDPS (core version 8.0) in accordance with the current 
Pharmacovigilance guideline. After assessing the 
documentation the CHMP concluded that the submitted

DDPS contained all required elements. Consequently, 
Annex II has been updated with the new version number of 
the agreed DDPS.

To amend section 4.8 of the hard capsules and oral 
18/12/2008 
30/01/2009 
SmPC, Annex 
Based on review of information from the published 
solution SPCs to add the terms anxiety, delirium and 
II and PL 
literature and the Novartis safety and clinical study 
pyrexia as common adverse events identified with 
use of Exelon patches. The package leaflets for the 
hard capsules and oral solution have been updated 
accordingly. 
The company also submitted an updated rivastigmine 
Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance 
system (DDPS) to Module 1.8.1. of the Exelon 
Marketing Authorisation, in accordance with the 
current pharmacovigilance guideline. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
databases, the MAH proposed that there is: a higher rate of 
Myocardial Infarction (MI) in the Exelon treatment group 
relative to placebo in Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies, no 
imbalance in the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents 
(CVA) in the overall Exelon group relative to placebo and a 
slight imbalance in the incidence of CVA with Exelon patch. 
In consequence, the following updates of the Exelon SPCs 
were initially proposed by the MAH:  
- 'myocardial infarction' is added as a rare adverse reaction 
(SPC section 4.8) of the Exelon oral formulations SPCs and 
referred to in the text of section 4.8 of the Exelon patch 
SPCs. 
- 'cerebrovascular accident' is added as an uncommon 
adverse reaction (SPC section 4.8) of Exelon patch SPCs 
and referred to in the text of section 4.8 of the Exelon oral 
formulations SPCs. 
- the adverse events 'anxiety', 'delirium', and 'pyrexia' are 
added in the SPC of Exelon hard capsules and oral 
formulation in section 4.8 as common adverse events 
Page 52/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occurring with Exelon patches.  
After assessing the data submitted by the MAH, the CHMP 
concluded that the results from provided studies are not 
robust enough either to justify addition of myocardial 
infarction event as a rare adverse reaction or 
cerebrovascular event as an uncommon adverse reaction in 
the SPCs of Exelon hard capsules and oral solution.  
Section 4.8 of the SPCs of Exelon hard capsules and oral 
formulation were amended to include the adverse events 
'anxiety', 'delirium', and 'pyrexia' as common adverse 
events. 
The Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
as described by the MAH (version 2.0) fulfils the legislative 
requirements as concluded by the CHMP and the 
Committee therefore recommended an update of Annex II 
accordingly.

on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance,

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit/risk profile of Exelon continues 
to be favourable.  
The CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal can be

Following the occurrence of 3 cases of oesophageal rupture, 
4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL in relation to 
II, Labelling 
the product information was updated to highlight that in

rupture' and 'Elevated liver function tests'.

case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine 
treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as recommended 
in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe 
vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture. After a 
review of its Clinical and Safety database, the MAH updated 
the product information to add 'Severe vomiting associated 
with oesophageal rupture' with the frequency 'very rare'. 
Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose 
increments or high doses of rivastigmine.  
The frequency of 'Elevated liver function tests' was also 
modified from very rare to uncommon. 
In addition some clarifications have been introduced in 
section 5.1 of the SPC and the MAH also applied for a 
combined PL for the hard capsules, updated the annexes in 
accordance with the latest QRD template and introduced 
minor linguistic corrections in some of the languages.

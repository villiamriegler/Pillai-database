1.  Introduction 
On May 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Jinarc, in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
This application contains the final clinical study report on the study 156-12-298 carried out as part of 
the tolvaptan paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-001231-PIP02). 
Study 156-12-298 is a phase  3b, two-part, multicenter, one  year randomized,  double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of the safety, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and efficacy of tolvaptan followed by a two-
year  open-label  extension  in  children  and  adolescent  subjects  with  Autosomal  Dominant  Polycystic 
Kidney Disease (ADPKD). 
There are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH. 
The trial is among the requirements of the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for tolvaptan and was 
the first trial of tolvaptan in a paediatric ADPKD population. 
The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted  over  3 years was to 
assess  the  effects  of  titrated  oral  tolvaptan  in  a  paediatric  and  adolescent  ADPKD  population.  The 
assessments included pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy (including total kidney 
volume [TKV]), and long-term safety (including growth and development) and tolerability.  
Trial 156-12-298 was compliant with the key binding elements agreed upon in the PIP decision EMEA-
001231-PIP02-13-M08: 
- Study 6, requested in the PIP, was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess the 
effects of titrated oral tolvaptan on renal size, pharmacokinetics and safety in children from 4 years to 
less than 18 years of age diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; followed by an 
open label extension phase to collect additional safety and efficacy data (156-12-298).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study 156-12-298 is part of a clinical development program (PIP EMEA-001231-
PIP02). No indication on if and when a variation of the application is provided. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study Oral tolvaptan 7.5-, 15-, and 30-mg 
immediate-release tablets with matching placebo were used in Trial 156-12-298. No paediatric-specific 
or extemporaneous formulation was used.  
2.2.  Clinical aspects

The trial comprised 2 phases. 
Phase A was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase to compare tolvaptan with placebo. 
The duration of treatment was 12 months. It was open to subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 years, 
inclusive. Subjects between the ages of 12 and 17 years were stratified by age and sex in the following 
cohorts: 
• 
• 
Female subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive 
Female subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive 
•  Male subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive 
•  Male subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive. 
Additionally,  subjects  aged  4  to  11  years  were  eligible  for  participation  following  discussion  with  the 
medical monitor who met criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for 
the target population. 
Qualified subjects who completed Phase A were eligible to continue into Phase B. A qualified subject was 
defined as one who was willing to continue in the trial and who did not have any adverse events (AEs) 
that would require IMP discontinuation. 
Phase B was an open-label phase during which subjects who had completed Phase A of the trial received 
treatment with tolvaptan for 24 months. The purpose of Phase B was to obtain safety and efficacy data 
for long-term use of tolvaptan.

Study participants 
The trial population included male and female subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive), with a diagnosis 
of ADPKD as defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria AND who had at least 10 
renal cysts, each of which measured at least 0.5 cm confirmed upon MRI inspection. In accordance with 
the PIP requirements, the trial also allowed subjects aged 4 to 11 years who met criteria for entry to be 
enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population. Subjects who were MRI-
naive or under the age of 12 must have had at least 4 cysts (at least 1 cm in size) confirmed by ultrasound 
prior to MRI inspection.

Treatments 
Tolvaptan was provided as 7.5-, 15-, and 30-mg spray-dried, immediate-release tablets with matching 
placebo. Tolvaptan was administered as a split-dose, with the first dose taken upon awakening and the 
second dose taken approximately 8 hours later. 
The current tolvaptan tablet formulation is limited to administration to those who can easily swallow a 
6 or 8 mm tablet and who weigh ≥ 20 kg. 
In Phase A of the trial, subjects were randomized to receive IMP defined as either active tolvaptan or 
matching placebo for 12 months. Starting doses were based on weight: 
• 
• 
≥ 20 kg to < 45 kg, 15/7.5 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo 
≥ 45 kg to ≤ 75 kg, 30/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo 
•  > 75 kg, 45/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo. 
After 1 week, subjects who tolerated their initial dose up-titrated once from their starting dose: 
• 
≥ 20 kg to < 45 kg, 30/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo

• 
≥ 45 kg to ≤ 75 kg, 45/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo 
•  > 75 kg, 60/30 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo 
Subjects may have down-titrated at any time during the trial; however, subjects were asked to stay on 
the highest tolerable dose (by weight group) if possible. 
Qualified subjects who have completed Phase A on treatment and continue in Phase B will receive open-
label tolvaptan for up to 24 months. In order to preserve the blind in Phase A, subjects will be started 
at a dose based on their current body weight and after 1 week, they will be asked to up-titrate once 
from their starting dose. Subjects who wish to lower their dose secondary to tolerance will have their 
doses adjusted as necessary. 
CHMP comment 
The  study  enrolled  patients  aged  12  to  17  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  ADPKD.  However,  the  trial  also 
allowed subjects aged 4 to 11 years who met criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the 
recruitment period for the target population according to the PIP requirements. Patients aged < 12 years 
must have had at least 4 cysts (at least 1 cm in size) confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection 
and this is acceptable as MRI usually requires sedation in younger children. The MAH reports that the 
current tolvaptan tablet formulation is limited to administration to those who can easily swallow a 6 or 
8 mm tablet and who weigh  ≥ 20 kg. The study protocol foreseen a questionnaire to be administered 
during Phase A to all subjects immediately after dosing to assess palatability and the easily to swallow 
the tablets. Submitted data does not include palatability assessment and if tablets were easy to swallow; 
this information needs to be provided in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.  
The study design with 12 months double-blind treatment duration could be considered sufficient to detect 
the potential benefit of tolvaptan over placebo in a pediatric population and is in accordance with the PIP 
requirement. 
Dosing rationale 
Successful treatment of ADPKD appears to require early and constant inhibition of the vasopressin V2 
receptor. Maintenance of tolvaptan concentrations for 24 hours produced decreased rates of growth in 
kidney size in animal models and therefore, subjects are encouraged to take the maximally tolerated 
dose. The clinical formulation of tolvaptan was optimized to increase bioavailability which necessitates 
split-dosing to maintain suppression of AVP action across 24 hours. A higher dose is used early in the 
day,  with  a  lower dose  approximately  8  to  9 hours later in order to  produce  a  maximal  inhibition  on 
waking, with a gradual fall-off of effect during the night when frequent urination could lead to interruption 
of sleep. Adult treatment starts with a split-dose regimen of 45 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the 
afternoon. The child and adolescent subjects to be enrolled in this trial will have well preserved renal 
function  and,  therefore,  at  the  adult  dose  will  likely  respond  with  potent  diuresis  and  experience 
aquaretic-related AEs. The starting dose regimens in this trial are based on the adult starting dose, with

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

adjustments for body weight. Subjects will be up-titrated to the equivalent of the starting dose used in 
adult trials  at Week 1, and down-titration for  tolerability  will  be  allowed. In the pivotal  trial for adult 
subjects  with  ADPKD  (156-04-251),  every  subject  started tolvaptan  dosing  with  the  45/15mg  dosing 
regimen  regardless of  their  weight.  When  dose  is  expressed  as  mg/kg,  as  shown  in  Table  2.2-1,  the 
maximum  starting  dose  given  to  an  adult  subject  was  1.11  mg/kg  with  the  lowest  dose  being  0.34 
mg/kg. This should provide sustained suppression while ameliorating excess aquaretic effects in those 
with high functioning kidneys. The weight ranges for pediatric subjects were selected so that the maximal 
starting dose for each weight range was no higher than 67% of the maximal adult dose. The up-titrated 
morning doses, expressed as mg/kg, are also presented for comparison to the adult trial.  
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the initial starting dose regimen will be allowed to down-titrate to a 
dose as low as 7.5 mg once daily. This will allow for the collection of the most information on tolerability, 
safety, and potentially efficacy as the minimally effective dose of tolvaptan has not been determined. 
Animal  studies  indicated  a  dose  response  in  tolvaptan  efficacy  with  lower  doses  is  still  better  than 
placebo. Adults in the pivotal 156-04-251 trial were titrated up in order to maximize inhibition of AVP 
but efficacy was observed in subjects who down titrated to 45/15 mg and 60/30 mg regimens. In the 
phase  2  156-04-250  trial,  subjects  on  the  fixed  regimen  of  45/15  mg  showed  less  efficacy  when 
compared  to  subjects  on  60/30  mg;  however,  both  groups  showed  slower  increase  in  TKV  when 
compared to a matched control group.  
CHMP comment 
As is already done in TEMPO study with adult dosing, participants received a higher dose early in the 
day,  followed  by  a  lower  dose  administered  approximately  8–9  h  later,  in  order  to  obtain  maximal 
inhibition on waking and a gradual fall-off of effect during the night, when frequent urination would lead 
to interruption of sleep. The approach is acceptable. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of the trial was to assess the long-term safety of treatment with tolvaptan in a 
pediatric and adolescent ADPKD population.

The secondary objective of the trial was to assess the PD, PK, and efficacy of tolvaptan in children and 
adolescent subjects with ADPKD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The coprimary endpoints were the change from baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) 
and specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A. 
The key secondary endpoint was the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total 
kidney volume (htTKV) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months. 
Other secondary endpoints were as follows: 
•  24-hour fluid balance prior to Week 1. 
•  Change from baseline in renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by 
Schwartz formula) at each clinic visit (Week 1, Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12 in Phase A). 
•  Change from baseline in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) at each clinic visit (Week 
1, Month 1, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24 in Phase B). 
•

fluid balance, sodium, creatinine, and free water clearance during dense PK sampling (after at 
least 1 month on the investigational medicinal product [IMP]). 
• 
Proportions of each Tanner Stage by sex and age compared to normative populations at 
baseline, 6 months, and 12 months during the placebo-controlled phase (Phase A), and every 
6 months during the open-label extension phase (Phase B).

baseline, 6 months, and 12 months during the placebo-controlled phase (Phase A), and every 
6 months during the open-label extension phase (Phase B). 
•  Safety variables (changes from baseline in creatinine, vital signs, laboratory values including 
liver function tests [LFTs], and rate of aquaretic adverse events [AEs]) in placebo and 
tolvaptan. 
Exploratory endpoints include: 
• 
Percent change in htTKV as measured by MRI from Phase A baseline to Phase B Month 24. 
•  Change from Phase A baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) and specific gravity 
(premorning dose) after 1 month (Phase A only).

CHMP comment 
The choice of the co-primary endpoint is in line with the PIP requirements. 
The co-primary endpoints are different to the primary endpoint used in the adult study (TEMPO) in which 
it was the rate of total kidney volume (TKV) change.  As reported in the EPAR (EMA/154879/2015) of 
tolvaptan MAA in adult population, longitudinal data from the CRISP 2 study published in 2012 suggested 
a correlation between TKV and total cyst volume, and a correlation of height-corrected TKV and GFR, 
out to 8 years of follow-up. Measures of renal volume are linked to the progressive development of renal 
cysts in ADPKD, and correlate with renal function, therefore it is considered an important endpoint. From 
the other hand it is acknowledged that changes in TKV growth could be difficult to detect in pediatric 
subjects. However, the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total kidney volume 
(htTKV) was the key secondary endpoint in the current pediatric study and this is acceptable. 
Sample size 
The target trial population will be at least 60 male and female subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive), 
with a diagnosis of ADPKD as defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria AND who 
have at least 10 renal cysts, each of which measures at least 0.5 cm confirmed upon magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) inspection. 
In accordance with the PIP requirements, the trial will also allow subjects aged 4 to 11 years who meet 
criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population. It 
is expected that the trial may enroll approximately 100 subjects. 
Subjects who are MRI-naive or under the age of 12 should have at least 4 cysts that are at least 1 cm 
in size confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection. 
Treatment groups for the required population will be stratified by age and gender in the following age 
cohorts: 
• 
• 
Female subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive 
Female subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive 
•  Male subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive 
•  Male subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive

When > 15 subjects are enrolled in an age cohort, new screening for that age cohort will be closed; 
subjects concurrently in screening for that age cohort may be enrolled if they meet inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. When the last subject in the final age cohort for the required population has been achieved, 
enrollment in the trial will cease. 
The trial is also open to children between the ages of 4 to 11 years (inclusive) with ADPKD, who meet 
the above criteria and who, in the opinion of the investigator, would benefit from treatment. Subjects, 
aged 4 to 11 years (inclusive), must have an ultrasound to assess renal cysts. 
Qualified subjects who complete Phase A on study medication are eligible to participate in Phase B. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The blind was not broken for any subjects in Phase A prior to the interim snapshot for the sponsor 
and prior to the final database lock for the trial sites.  
Phase B was open-label and blinding procedures were not applicable; however, the trial sites were to 
remain blinded until completion of the trial or a safety need arose. 
Statistical Methods 
In general, Phase A baseline measurements of safety variables are defined as their last measurements 
prior to the randomization for the safety population. Phase B baseline measurements of safety variables 
are defined as the last measurements prior to the first dose of IMP in Phase B. Safety analysis will be 
conducted  based  on  the  safety  population,  defined  in  Section  5.1.  Standard  safety  variables  to  be 
analyzed include AEs, change from baseline in creatinine, vital signs, laboratory values including liver 
function tests (LFTs), and rate of aquaretic AEs. In  general, descriptive statistics will be provided for 
Phase A safety variables and Phase B safety variables as well. Subgroup analysis of key safety endpoints 
by age cutoff (<12 years vs. ≥ 12 years) will be summarized. 
Only descriptive statistics were provided. 
No interim analysis was planned before all randomized subjects either completed the Month 12 visit or 
early terminated in Phase A (the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of this trial). A snapshot of the 
database  was  taken  after  all  subjects  in  Phase  A  completed  or  early  terminated;  these  data  were 
unblinded  (but  the  trial  sites  remained  blinded)  and  an  interim  CSR  was  written  to  provide  early 
information on safety. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 91 subjects were randomized and took at least 1 dose of IMP in Phase A of the trial. All 91 
subjects were included in the safety and primary efficacy analyses for Phase 
A. For the purposes of this trial: 
•  Subjects who were randomized and took IMP through the Month 12 visit in Phase A and 
completed some or all of the trial visit assessments were defined as Phase A on treatment 
completers.

•  Subjects who were randomized and discontinued IMP prior to the Month 12 visit in Phase A and 
completed some or all of the trial visit assessments were defined as Phase A off-treatment 
completers. 
•  Subjects who were randomized, took IMP, but did not complete the Phase A Month 12 visit or 
the Phase B Month 24 visit were defined as Trial non-completers. 
A total of 84 (92.3%) subjects completed Phase A.  The percentages of on-treatment completers were 
91.7% in the tolvaptan group and 90.7% in the placebo group. There  was 1 off-treatment completer 
(2.3%) in the placebo group and none in the tolvaptan group. 
A total of 8 (8.8%) subjects discontinued the IMP prior to Month 12 in Phase A: 8.3% of the tolvaptan 
group and 9.3% of the placebo group. 
A total of 81 subjects were enrolled into Phase B and took at least 1 dose of IMP. All 81 subjects were 
included in the safety analyses for Phase B. Of the 81 subjects, 69 subjects (85.2%) completed Phase B 
of the trial and 12 subjects (14.8%) discontinued from the trial. Six (7.4%) of the subjects completed 
Phase B of the trial off-treatment (i.e., these subjects discontinued IMP prior to the Phase B Month 24 
visit  but  continued  with  trial  visit  assessments);  3  subjects  on  prior  tolvaptan  and  prior  placebo, 
respectively.

Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Of the 91 randomized subjects in Phase A, 25 (27.5%) were < 12 years old, 32 (35.2%) were 12 to 14 
years old, and 34 (37.4%) were 15 to 17 years old. Of the 81 treated subjects in Phase B, 23 (28.4%) 
were < 12 years old, 27 (33.3%) were 12 to 14 years old, and 31 (38.3%) were 15 to 17 years old. 
A total of 81 subjects were enrolled in Phase B of the trial and took at least 1 dose of IMP. All 81 
subjects were included in the safety analyses for Phase B. For this trial: 
•  Subjects who took IMP through the Month 24 visit in Phase B and completed some or all of the 
trial visit assessments were defined as On-treatment trial completers. 
•  Subjects who discontinued IMP prior to the Month 24 visit in Phase B and completed some or 
all of the trial visit assessments were defined as Off-treatment trial completers. 
Of the 81 subjects enrolled in Phase B, 69 (85.2%) completed Phase B. The numbers and percentages 
of on-treatment completers were 33 (78.6%) in the prior tolvaptan group and 30 (76.9%) in the prior 
placebo group. There were 3 off-treatment completers in each group: 7.1% of the tolvaptan group and 
7.7% of the placebo group. A total of 12 subjects discontinued from the trial in Phase B: 14.3% of the 
tolvaptan group and 15.4% of the placebo group.

CHMP comment 
Demographic characteristics are well balanced between tolvaptan and placebo both in phase A and phase 
B. The most represented age group was 15 to17 years (37.5% and 37.2% in phase A and 40.5% and 
35.9% in phase B) and almost all patients were white (95.8% and 97.7% in phase A and 100% and 
97.4% in phase B). The overall mean age was 12.9 years (range: 5 - 17 years) and the mean body mass 
index (BMI) was 20.0 kg/m2 (range: 14.2 - 34.9 kg/m2).  
Even if a diagnosis of ADPKD as defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria (AND 
who had at least 10 renal cysts) was required by inclusion criteria, only a low number of subjects had a 
genetic testing done (29,2 % in tolvaptan group vs 30.2% in plb group), of which only 2 patients (14.3%) 
in  the  study  group  were  ADPKD-1  positive.  The  majority  of  patients  were  aware  of  a  positive  family 
history before diagnosis (89.6% in tolva vs 90.7% in plb), however it is not clear if patients without a 
family history had a genetic diagnosis. This information should be included in case the MAH will apply 
for an extension of indication  
Overall, the mean total kidney volume was higher in the placebo group (393.3 mL) than in tolva group 
(286.1 mL) suggesting a possible more advanced disease in this group of patients, even though the low 
number of patients (13 in plb group) makes difficult to draw firm conclusion. 
Number analysed 
Three analysis sets were defined for the efficacy and safety analyses in this trial: 
• 
• 
The randomized analysis set consists of all subjects who were randomized in the trial. 
The full analysis set (FAS) for Phase A consists of all subjects who were randomized to a 
treatment group, received at least 1 dose of the IMP, and had both a Phase A baseline and at 
least 1 postbaseline efficacy evaluation. These subjects were analyzed according to the 
treatment group to which they were randomized. The FAS for Phase B consists of all subjects 
who enrolled to Phase B, received at least 1 dose of the IMP, and had both a baseline and at 
least 1 postbaseline efficacy evaluation in Phase B. The FAS, which is based on an intent-to-
treat principle, is the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses on the primary/key secondary 
endpoints and other secondary endpoints.

Efficacy results 
Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline in spot urine osmolality and in 
specific gravity after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A of the trial. The mean change from baseline in 
spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A was substantially greater 
in the tolvaptan group (−386 mOsm/kg, from  635  to  250 mOsm/kg)  versus the  placebo group (−93 
mOsm/kg, from 646 to 553 mOsm/kg) (Table 2.5.4.6-1, below). These findings were consistent across 
age groups and for each sex. 
The mean change from baseline in specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in 
Phase A was greater in the tolvaptan group (−0.009, from 1.017 to 1.008) versus the placebo group 
(−0.002, from 1.017 to 1.015) (Table 2.5.4.6 2, below). The same trend was seen at 1 month. These 
findings were consistent across age groups and for each sex.

CHMP comment 
A greater change from  baseline in spot urine  osmolality as well as in specific gravity at 1  week,  was 
observed in tolvaptan group than in placebo group and this is reassuring. Moreover, these changes are 
maintained up to 1 month from baseline. Results from the co-primary endpoints seem to suggest that 
tolvaptan  is  effective  in  reducing  urine  osmolality  and  in  increasing  the  output  of  water,  as  could  be 
expected from its mechanism of action (inhibition of V2 receptor). Therefore, these endpoints indicates 
that tolvaptan can inhibit the V2 receptor also in  the pediatric population in a similar manner than in 
adults. However, even if recent studies seem to support the link between vasopressin V2R signalling and 
renal disease progression in ADPKD (Devuys O., 2016), these results need to be translated in a clinical 
effect, in particular in a reduction of clinical progression. Moreover, the study lack of a statistical analysis 
and therefore these results could be only considered as descriptive. 
The mean change in spot urine osmolality from baseline across age groups was slightly lower in patients 
from  15-17 years (-378 mOsm/kg at week  1  and  295 at month 1)  compared to patients  from  12-14 
years (-459 mOsm/kg at week 1 and -466 mOsm/kg at month 1), with a similar trend also for change 
from baseline in specific gravity. Moreover, a greater change of spot urine osmolality was observed in 
the placebo arm of patients aged 15-17, suggesting a minor effect of tolvaptan over placebo in this age 
group. Furthermore, no data results on co-primary endpoints have been provided in patients younger

than 12 years which should be provided or otherwise this lack should be justified in case the MAH will 
apply for an extension of indication 
Key Secondary Endpoint 
The mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 12 
to 17 years old was smaller in the tolvaptan group (2.28%) versus the placebo group (6.11%) in Phase 
A (Table 2.5.4.7 1). One subject in the tolvaptan group was enrolled with a concomitant diagnosis of 
tuberous sclerosis and therefore had a notably larger kidney size when compared with the other subjects. 
When htTKV was assessed without the inclusion of this subject, the trend favoring tolvaptan remained 
intact: without this subject, the mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured 
by  MRI)  for  subjects 12  to  17  years  old  was  also  smaller in  the tolvaptan group  (2.84%)  versus the 
placebo group (6.11%).

CHMP comment 
A smaller mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 
12 to 17 years old was observed in the tolvaptan group (2.28%) versus the placebo group (6.11%) in 
Phase  A.  The  results  seem  to  be  in  line  with  those  of  the  adult  studies.  A  difference  with  placebo  in

change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV was constant by age groups, even though with more limited 
results in patients aged 15 to 17 Years.  
Height- adjusted TKV (htTKV) on MRI is at present the most established imaging surrogate parameter 
for monitoring disease progression in adult with ADPKD and TKV was the one used as primary endpoint 
in TEMPO study supporting tolvaptan authorization in adult population. Despite the scarce knowledges 
relating to the htTKV value in pediatric population, it is reported in literature that the vast majority of 
children with ADPKD maintained normal kidney function despite progressive structural kidney disease, 
thus emphasizing the great importance of total kidney volume (TKV) as a measurable outcome of early 
disease progression and the primary focus of therapeutic intervention in the pediatric ADPKD population 
(M. A. Cadnapaphornchai, 2017). Unfortunately, even if the difficulties in doing MRI mainly in younger 
and/or non-cooperative children who  require sedation are  acknowledged,  it  was noted  that only  data 
from 57 patients were provided, limiting the robustness of these results in support of the co-primary 
endpoints. However, data from ultrasound evaluation in 9 patients < 12 years old have been provided, 
which seem to be no sufficiently supportive (see below among other secondary endpoints). 
Other Secondary Endpoints 
The mean 24-hour fluid balance for all subjects prior to Week 1 in Phase A was 31 mL in the tolvaptan 
group versus 241 mL in the placebo group, and  in Phase  B was 138 mL in the prior tolvaptan group 
versus 207 mL for the prior placebo group prior to Week 1.  
The mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) from baseline to 12 months 
in Phase A was −1.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the tolvaptan group versus −0.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo 
group. To account for the known acute hemodynamic effects of tolvaptan, a supplemental analysis was 
done to determine the change in eGFR using Week 1 as a baseline in Phase A. In this analysis, the mean 
change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) from Week 1 to 12 months in Phase A was 2.6 
versus  −3.2  mL/min/1.73  m2  in  the  tolvaptan  versus  placebo  groups,  respectively.  This  analysis 
indicates that, after accounting for hemodynamic effects, the placebo group experienced more loss of 
eGFR over 12 months than the tolvaptan group.  
Age subgroup analyses of the mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) from baseline 
to 12 months in Phase A had similar results, except in the 15 to 17 year old subgroup, where the change 
was similar between treatment groups. For subjects 12 to 17 years old, the mean change in renal function 
from Week 1 to 12 months in Phase A was −0.1 versus −3.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the tolvaptan versus 
placebo groups, respectively. The mean change in this time period was 1.5 vs. −1.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 
for  males  and  −5.5  versus  −0.2  mL/min/1.73  m2  for  females  in  the  tolvaptan  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively.

In Phase B, the mean change from baseline to 24 months in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) 
was  greater  in  the  prior  placebo  group  versus  the  tolvaptan  group  (−10.3  versus  −5.2  mL/min/1.73 
m2), due to hemodynamic effects. In subgroup analyses of the same time period, mean renal function 
changes showed similar differences between treatment groups for each age group. The mean change in 
this time period for male subjects was also greater in the prior placebo group versus the prior tolvaptan 
group for both male and female subjects (−11.4 versus −6.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in male subjects, and 
−9.4 versus −3.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in female subjects, respectively). 
The  mean  percent  change  from  Phase  A  baseline  to  24  months  in  Phase  B  in  htTKV  (as 
measured by MRI) was consistently less in the prior tolvaptan group versus the prior placebo group in 
subjects 15 to 17 years old and in both females and males. The reverse was found in subjects 12 to 14 
years old at 12 and 24 months: the mean change from baseline in htTKV was less in the prior placebo 
group versus the prior tolvaptan group. 
In Phase B, the mean percent change in htTKV (measured by MRI) from Phase B baseline to 12 and 
24  months  was  less  in  the  prior  placebo  group  (3.09%  and  7.35%,  respectively)  versus  the  prior 
tolvaptan group (7.68% and 13.55%, respectively). A similar result was seen in subgroup analyses for

each sex and age group, except for subjects 15 to 17 years old at 24 months, for whom the change was 
similar in both the prior placebo and prior tolvaptan groups.  
No notable differences in Tanner Staging progression compared to normative populations were found 
between  the  two  treatment  groups  at  any  time  point  in  either  Phase  A  or  B,  nor  in  the  age  and  sex 
groups. The mean change in growth percentiles for height  and  weight  from baseline to 12 months in 
Phase A was 1 in the tolvaptan group and −4 in the placebo group. In Phase B, the mean change in this 
endpoint was 3 in the prior tolvaptan group versus 4 in the prior placebo group at 12 months, and 0 in 
the prior tolvaptan group versus 5 in the prior placebo group at 24 months. 
Time to discontinue to any reason 
Health-related  quality  of  life  (HrQoL)  showed  a  sustained  improvement  with  tolvaptan  treatment 
across core domains and stable fatigue scores in Phase A, indicating a low level of disease and treatment 
burden as well as a high level of functioning. In Phase B, subjects in the prior placebo group generally 
improved  to  similar  levels  reported  by  subjects  in  the  prior  tolvaptan  group.  Both  groups  showed 
improved HrQoL scores compared to baseline during the treatment period.

Percent Change in htTKV as Measured by Ultrasound for Subjects Under 12 Years Old 
CHMP comment 
A number of other secondary endpoints have been explored. Overall, they seem to  be in line with co-
primary and key secondary endpoints. The mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) 
showed a difference between tolvaptan group and placebo when analyzed from week 1 to month 12 due 
to the hemodynamic effect. However, no difference between tolvaptan and placebo group in the mean 
change in renal function was observed in 15 to 17 years age group, while the change was more evident 
in females.  
The mean percent change from Phase A baseline in htTKV as measured by ultrasound (for 
subjects < 12 years old) at 12 months is slightly greater in the tolvaptan group (20.42%) 
than in the placebo group (16.27%) from baseline to month 12 in Phase A. Therefore 
change of htTKV measured by ultrasound seems to be not consistent with that of htTKV as 
measured by MRI in older patients arising further uncertainties on the evaluation of TKV in 
children mainly in younger. This aspect needs to be well justified at the time  of submission 
of data for the extension of indication. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data 
Among the secondary endpoints there were PD endpoints such as urine volume (including 24-hour fluid 
volume), fluid intake and fluid balance, sodium, creatinine, and free water clearance during dense PK 
sampling (after at least 1 month on the investigational medicinal product [IMP]). 
Other endpoints included tolvaptan PK parameters following dense PK sampling

Sampling 
A subset of 20 subjects in the 12 to 17 year-old age group had dense PK and PD sampling conducted at 
selected  sites  after  at  least  1  month  of  IMP  treatment.  Samples  were  collected  predose  (within  15 
minutes prior to the morning dose), 1, 2, 4, 8 (within 15 minutes prior to the afternoon dose), 12, and 
24 hours post the morning dose. These subjects will be hospitalized the evening prior to the scheduled 
PK sampling (typically a Friday evening) and discharged after the 24 hour PK sample collection (typically 
Sunday morning). 
For  dense  PK  sampling,  tolvaptan  concentrations  will  be  analyzed  by  noncompartmental  methods. 
Concentrations will be summarized with descriptive statistics by total daily dose of tolvaptan and time 
point. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized with descriptive statistics by total daily dose of 
tolvaptan. No subjects or data were excluded from the dense PK/PD analysis. 
The DM-4103 metabolite has a half-life of approximately 180 hours and, consequently, is a good marker 
of long-term compliance with dosing. 
Bioanalytical report 
Plasma samples were analyzed for tolvaptan (OPC-41061) and its metabolites, DM-4103 and DM-4107, 
using  a  validated  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  method  with  tandem  mass  spectrometric 
detection (HPLC-MS/MS). Tolvaptan, metabolites, and the internal standard OPC-41100 were extracted 
from  human plasma containing sodium  heparin  as an anticoagulant using solid phase  extraction. The 
method was validated for concentrations ranging from 5.00 to 1000 ng/mL for tolvaptan, 12.5 to 12500 
ng/mL for DM-4103, and 12.5 to 2500 ng/mL for DM-4107.  
A total of 276 samples were analyzed for OPC-41061 and DM-4107. A total of 275 samples were analyzed 
for DM-4103.

DM-4103 has a long half-life, approximately 180 hours, making DM-4103 concentrations a good marker 
of compliance because concentrations accumulate, up to 30 μg/mL in adults dosed with tolvaptan 120 
mg  daily.  Steady-state  concentrations  following  60  mg  daily  are  rarely  below  1  μg/mL.  Therefore, 
subjects with consistent concentrations below this level yet reporting daily dosing at 60 mg/day or higher 
would  be  considered  noncompliant  with  their  reported  dosing.  If  expected  concentrations  were  500 
ng/mL, as might be observed following a 37.5-mg daily dose, subjects with concentrations near or less 
than  the  LLOQ  (12.5  ng/mL)  would  have  discontinued  IMP  about  5  weeks  previously.  DM-4103 
concentrations  at  Week  1  and  Month  1  were  consistent  with  reported  dosing  for  all  subjects  with  an 
evaluable sample. At Month 6, 1 of 42 subjects (2.4%) with a PK sample was not compliant with reported 
dosing.  At  Month  12,  5  additional  subjects  (for  a  total  of  6  out  of  40  subjects  [15%])  had  DM-4103 
concentrations ranging from 0 to < 140 ng/mL (PKT-4), indicating noncompliance with reported dosing 
and limited to no dosing within the previous weeks. 
Pharmacodynamics Results 
The pharmacodynamic analysis includes: 
•  Urine osmolality and specific gravity 
•  24-hour fluid balance 
•  Serum sodium, creatinine, and osmolality 
•  Urine volume and urine sodium, creatinine, and osmolality 
• 
• 
Fluid intake 
Palatability and acceptability of tolvaptan formulation 
Fluid intake and urine output were higher in the tolvaptan group, which is not surprising given tolvaptan’s 
aquaretic effects. Subjects appeared to maintain a neutral fluid balance, as fluid balance was close to 
zero over 24 hours.

In addition to increasing urine output, tolvaptan administration produced decreases in urine osmolality 
and increases in free water clearance, indicating target engagement at the V2 receptor for the 24-hour 
dosing interval in all subjects, despite the range of doses being taken.

After a review of the data, PK/PD correlations were not explored. Subjects participating in the dense 
PK/PD  sampling  took  tolvaptan  daily  doses  ranging  from  22.5  mg  to  60  mg.  Even  after  normalizing 
concentrations to a 1 mg/kg dose, concentrations were highly variable (PKF-1, Panel B), but all tolvaptan 
doses  reduced  urine  osmolality  to  the  same  extent  during  the  24-hour  sampling  period.  Intersubject 
variability in urine output following tolvaptan dosing was high with 24-hour urine volumes ranging from 
4245 to 13550 mL, with no obvious dose-response relationship. 
MAH’s conclusions 
For subjects participating in the dense PK/PD sampling: 
• 
• 
Intersubject variability of tolvaptan plasma concentrations was large even after normalization 
of doses. 
Tolvaptan administration produced increases in free water clearance and urine output with 
decreases in urine osmolality, indicating target engagement at the V2 receptor. 
•  Subjects appeared to be maintaining their fluid balance, as fluid balance for 24 hours was 
close to zero and serum sodium and osmolality were similar at predose and 24 hours 
postdose. 
•  As expected, excretion of sodium and sodium clearance was not changed by tolvaptan 
administration. 
• 
PK/PD correlations were not performed, as visual inspection of intersubject variability in PD 
responses indicated no obvious dose response. 
CHMP comment 
The study samples were analysed for determination of tolvaptan, DM-4103 and DM-4107 using HPLC-
MS/MS according to a mentioned validation report  dated  2015; however,  this validation report is not 
included  in  the  current  dossier.  All  samples  were  analysed  in  the  LTS  range  and  were  within  the 
established  calibration  range.  Twenty  subjects  of  12-17  years  of  age  (12  in  treatment  arm  and  8  in 
placebo arm) were included in a subset of patient with dense PK/PD sampling conducted after 1 month 
of treatment at predose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post the morning dose. No subjects below 12 years 
of age had dense PK sampling.  
The  doses  administered  to  these  12  patients  at  1  month  after  the  start  of  treatment  were  22.5  mg 
(15/7.5 mg, N=1), 37.5 mg (22.5/15 mg, N=3), 45 mg (30/15 mg, N=3) and 60 mg (45/15 mg, N=5). 
According to the selected tolvaptan dose based on weight, subjects ≥ 45 kg to ≤ 75 kg were administered 
with a starting dose of 30/15 mg tolvaptan; if tolerated, the starting dose was followed by, after 1 week, 
a dose of 45/15 mg. Six subjects (out of 12 treated with tolvaptan) weighting between 55 kg and 71.2 
kg, at 1 month of treatment, had a down-titration at the starting dose (2 subjects remained on 45 mg) 
or less than the starting dose (e.g. one subject weighing approximately 70 kg, should have taken a final 
dose of 60 mg, whereas they took 22.5 mg). The reasons why a high percentage of patients downgraded 
to a lower dose of that foreseen after 1 month are not clear since overall seems to suggest it could be 
inadequate (safety concerns?). In case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication clarification is 
expected. 
The PK analysis showed that the median Tmax was reached after 2 hours for all morning doses except 
for  22.5  mg  dose  that however  was  administered  to  only  one  subject.  The  Tmax  after  the  afternoon 
doses, according to the provided figure, seems to be delayed (about 4 h). The median Cmax seems not 
increase with increasing dose, the median  AUC0-24h  although  similar between  doses, showed a very 
high variability, presumably due to the low number of patients. The metabolites DM-4103 and DM-4107 
were also determined in samples. DM-4103 was used to check the compliance to the treatment, with 6

out of 40 subjects (of which 2 in dense PK sampling) non-compliant. The MAH provides individual plasma 
concentrations during dense PK/PD sampling period in paediatrics overlaid with mean tolvaptan plasma 
concentrations in healthy adults following a 45 mg/15 mg split-dose regimen, normalised by dose. It is 
noted that in paediatric patients dosed with 45 mg (30/15 mg, N=3) and 60 mg (45/15 mg, N=5) after 
one month of treatment, showed Cmax values higher than in adults after the morning dose. Therefore, 
an adequate definition and a comprehensive discussion of the selected dose, including the starting one, 
is expected in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.  
In subjects with dense PD sampling, urine osmolality and specific gravity, 24-hours fluid balance, serum 
sodium, creatinine and osmolality, urine volume and urine sodium, were determined.  
The urine osmolality decrease in all dose groups, urine volume and free water clearance increase in all 
groups, 24-hours fluid balance remain unchanged, sodium excretion and clearance did not change; no 
clear  trend  between  dose  groups  is  observed  for  serum  sodium,  creatinine  and  osmolality  and  the 
creatinine  clearance.  These  results  have  no  clear  relationship  with  administered  doses  and  can  only 
confirm the aquaretic effect of tolvaptan due to its mechanism of action.  
Among the PD analysis, the protocol foreseen the palatability and acceptability of tolvaptan formulation; 
however, no data is provided. 
Safety results 
Extent of Exposure  
All 91 randomized subjects in Phase A received at least 1 dose of IMP and were included in the safety 
analyses. Exposure up to 361 to 390 days was achieved in 33 of 48 subjects (68.8%) in the tolvaptan 
group and 29 of 43 subjects (67.4%) in the placebo group. The average daily dose during that time was 
40.4 mg in the tolvaptan group and 52.6 mg in the placebo group. 
For subjects 12 to 17 years old, 12 subjects were on a modal TDD of 45 mg tolvaptan while 13 subjects 
were on a modal TDD of 37.5 or 60 mg tolvaptan at 12 months. For subjects < 12 years old, 4 subjects 
were on a modal TDD of 22.5 mg tolvaptan and 4 subjects were on a modal TDD of 15 mg tolvaptan at 
12 months. 
All  81  enrolled  subjects  in  Phase  B  received  at  least  1  dose  of  IMP  and  were  included  in  the  safety 
analyses.  Exposure  up  to  691  to  720  days  was  achieved  in  21  of  42  subjects  (50.0%)  in  the  prior 
tolvaptan group and 19 of 39 subjects (48.7%) in the prior placebo group. The average daily dose during 
that time was 37.5 mg in the prior tolvaptan group and 38.7 mg in the prior placebo group. 
CHMP comment 
More  than  half  of  patients  achieved  a  1  year  of  exposure  both  in  tolvaptan  and  placebo  group.  The 
average daily dose was different among age groups, and this is expected. However, it was noted that 
modal TDD was different among patients within the same age group, with the majority of patient of 12 
to 17 years as well as < 12 years taking 45 mg of modal TDD in tolvaptan group. However, the number 
of patients taking different TDD seem to be balanced within the group. In phase B almost 50% of patients 
achieved up to 720 days of exposure and the average daily dose remained 37.5 mg in the prior tolvaptan 
group. 
See comment above regarding the dose.

Adverse events 
Overall, a total of 526 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 86 of 91 subjects 
(94.5%) during Phase A of the trial (see table below). 
Overall, a total of 613 TEAEs were reported for 77 of 81 subjects (95.1%) during  Phase B of the trial 
(CT-2.8.1.1). The incidence of TEAEs was lower in the prior tolvaptan group (38 subjects [90.5%]) than 
in the prior placebo group (39 subjects [100.0%]) (Table 12.2.1-2). Serious TEAEs were reported in 7 
subjects in the prior tolvaptan group and 8 subjects in the placebo group, while discontinuations due to 
AEs were reported in 3 subjects in the prior placebo group only. There were no deaths reported in this 
trial.

The  incidence  of  aquaretic  TEAEs  (Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  [MedDRA]  preferred 
terms of dry mouth, thirst, polydipsia, nocturia, pollakiuria, and polyuria) in Phase A was higher in the 
tolvaptan group (31 of 48 subjects [64.6%]) than in the placebo group (7 of 43 subjects [16.3%]) (Table 
12.2.2.1-2). The most frequently reported aquaretic TEAEs in the tolvaptan group were polyuria (27.1% 
tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo) and pollakiuria (18.8% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo). 
The  incidence  of  dehydration-related  TEAEs  (including  all  preferred  terms  under  the  dehydration 
standardised  MedDRA  queries  [SMQ]  that  were  reported  in  this  trial)  in  Phase  A  was  higher  in  the 
tolvaptan group (17 of 48 subjects [35.4%]) than in the placebo group (6 of 43 subjects [14.0%]) (Table 
12.2.2.1-3). The most frequently reported dehydration-related TEAEs in the tolvaptan group were thirst 
(14.6%  tolvaptan  versus  4.7%  placebo)  and  orthostatic  hypotension  (10.4%  tolvaptan  versus  0.0% 
placebo). 
Related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the tolvaptan group and at 
a higher incidence than the placebo group) assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP in Phase 
A were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Polyuria (27.1% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
Pollakiuria (18.8% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo) 
Blood creatinine increased (16.7% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
Nocturia (14.6% tolvaptan versus 7.0% placebo) 
Thirst (12.5% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
Headache (10.4% tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo) 
Polydipsia (10.4% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  (occurring  in  at  least  10%  of  subjects  overall)  assessed  by  the 
investigator as related to the IMP in Phase B were as follows: 
•  Blood creatinine increased (14.3% prior tolvaptan versus 12.8% prior placebo) 
•  Headache (4.8% prior tolvaptan versus 17.9% prior placebo)

Polyuria (4.8% prior tolvaptan versus 33.3% prior placebo) 
CHMP comment 
A similar rate of patients with TEAE were reported in tolvaptan and placebo group in phase A (91.7% 
and 97.7%, respectively). They were all no serious TEAEs, except for 1 patient in tolvaptan group and 
6 patients in placebo group who experienced serious TEAEs. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported 
in 1 subject in each treatment group, while no deaths were reported in this study. 
In  phase  B  of  the  trial  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  lower  in  the  prior  tolvaptan  group  (38  subjects 
[90.5%]) than in the prior placebo group (39 subjects [100.0%]), as well as serious TEAEs (16.7% vs 
20.5%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs which occurred more frequently in at least 10% of subjects in the 
tolvaptan group than in the placebo group in Phase A were: polyuria (27.1% tolvaptan versus 4.7% 
placebo), Blood creatinine increased (18.8% vs 4.7%), pollakiuria (18.8% vs 0.0%), cough (14.6% vs 
11.6%),  nocturia  (14.6%  vs  7.0%),  thirst  (14.6%  vs  4.7%),  abdominal  pain  (12.5%  vs  7.0%), 
constipation (10.4% vs 2.3%), orthostatic hypotension (10.4% vs 0.0% placebo), polydipsia (10.4% vs 
2.3%),  abdominal  pain  upper  (10.4%  vs  9.3%).  The  incidence  of  aquaretic  TEAEs  and  dehydration-
related TEAEs was higher in the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group (64.4% vs 16.3% and 35.4% 
vs 14%). These AEs are expected due to the mechanism of action of the drug and to the known safety 
profile  in  adult  patients  and  are  reflected  in  the  SmPC,  however  they  are  considered  of  concern  in  a 
pediatric population, mainly in younger patients, more sensitive to acquaretic AEs. Moreover, most of 
these  AEs  are  also  the  more  frequently  TEAEs  related  to  study  drug.  However,  it  was  noted  that  in 
phase B of the trial they are reduced in tolvaptan group ad increased in placebo group, maybe due to 
titration in the early stage.  
This trial had a small number of subjects and no formal subgroup analyses were performed for the TEAEs 
in the trial. 
Deaths and other serious adverse events 
No deaths occurred during the trial 
In  Phase  A  of  the  trial  there  was  1  subject  in  the  tolvaptan  group  who  had  a  serious  TEAE  of  viral 
pericarditis  which  the  investigator  assessed  as  moderate  severity  and  not  related  to  tolvaptan.  The 
subject was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain, dizziness, and suspected endocarditis. 
No corrective treatments were administered, and the event resolved after 8 days. 
There were 6 subjects in the placebo group who had serious TEAEs: 1 subject had a hand fracture and 
ulna  fracture,  1  subject  had  hematuria  and  renal  pain,  1  subject  had  an  intentional  overdose  and 
intentional self-injury, and 1 subject each had petit mal epilepsy, pelvic pain, and hypertensive crisis. 
None  of  the  serious  TEAEs  reported  in  both  treatment  groups  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
related to the IMP. 
In Phase B of the trial there were 7 subjects in the prior tolvaptan group who had serious TEAEs (see 
table below).

The event of ulcerative colitis was assessed by the investigator as severe and not related to tolvaptan. 
The subject was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and increased frequency of blood in the 
stool.  As  a  result  of  this  event,  dosing  of  tolvaptan  was  interrupted.  Corrective  treatments  included 
methylprednisone and the event resolved after 7 days. 
One serious TEAE of ALT increased in 1 subject and serious TEAEs of ALT and AST increased in 1 subject 
were all assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP 
CHMP comment 
Overall, the frequency of serious TEAEs was lower in the tolvaptan group both in Phase A and B. Serious 
adverse events were reported in 1 patient in phase A in tolvaptan group (viral pericarditis) which was 
considerate moderate in intensity and not related by the investigator and in 7 patients in phase B in prior 
tolvaptan group of which the event of ulcerative colitis was reported as not related by the investigator. 
One serious TEAE of ALT increased in 1 subject and serious TEAEs of ALT and AST increased in 1 subject 
were all assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP.  
. No death was reported in this trial.

AEs leading to discontinuation 
One  subject  in  the  tolvaptan  group  discontinued  IMP  due  to  pollakiuria  and  1  subject  in  the  placebo 
group discontinued IMP due to dizziness, both in Phase A. Both events were assessed by the investigator 
as moderate severity and as related to the IMP. 
Three subjects in Phase B discontinued IMP due to eating disorder, polyuria, and liver 
function test increased. All events were assessed by the investigator as moderate severity and the event 
of polyuria was assessed as related to the IMP. 
AEs of special interest (AESI) 
There were no adverse events of special interest (AESI) reported during the trial.  
For  the  5  hepatic  standardised  MedDRA  queries  (SMQs;  cholestasis  and  jaundice  of  hepatic  origin; 
hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis, and other liver damage-related conditions; noninfectious hepatitis; 
liver-related  investigations,  signs,  and  symptoms;  and  liver-related  coagulation  and  bleeding 
disturbances), in Phase A there was 1 TEAE of increased blood bilirubin in the placebo group. In Phase 
B in the prior tolvaptan group there were 5 subjects with TEAEs: 3 TEAEs of increased ALT, 1 TEAE of 
increased  AST,  and  1  TEAE  of  increased  hepatic  enzymes;  in  the  prior  placebo  group  there  were  6 
subjects with TEAEs: 3 TEAEs of increased AST, 2 TEAEs of increased LFT, and 1 TEAE each of increased 
ALT, increased blood bilirubin, and increased hepatic enzyme, respectively. Six subjects spontaneously 
recovered without intervention, in 4 subjects treatment was interrupted, and in 1 subject treatment was 
withdrawn (withdrawal was not related to hepatic AEs). 
Pregnancy 
There were no pregnancies reported during the trial 
Laboratory Values  
Changes  from  baseline  were  observed  for  various  serum  chemistry  and  hematology  parameters; 
however, none of the changes were considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Any  shifts  from  the  normal  limits  at  baseline  to  outside  of  the  reference  limits  (low  or  high)  at 
postbaseline  evaluations  for  clinical  laboratory  parameters  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically 
meaningful. 
Changes from baseline were observed for erythrocytes and leukocytes in urinalysis however, none of 
the changes were considered to be clinically meaningful. 
There were no cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in either phase of the trial. 
There were no subjects who experienced elevated transaminases and no potentially clinically significant 
(PCS)  elevations  in  hepatic  laboratory  data  were  reported  during  Phase  A  of  the  trial.  Four  subjects 
experienced PCS elevations in hepatic laboratory data during Phase B of the trial, including 3 serious 
AEs (1 prior tolvaptan subject and 2 prior placebo subjects) and 1 AE leading to discontinuation (prior 
placebo  subject).  The  4  PCS  elevations  in  hepatic  laboratory  data  were  reviewed  independently  by 
hepatic adjudication committee and considered unlikely related to tolvaptan. 
In Phase A, PCS increases in creatinine occurred in 4 subjects in the tolvaptan group and in no subjects 
in  the  placebo group.  In addition,  the  following  PCS  laboratory  test  results were  reported:  2  placebo

subjects had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 placebo subject had a decrease in glucose, and 1 tolvaptan 
subject had an increase in potassium. 
In Phase B, PCS increases in creatinine occurred in 3 subjects in the prior tolvaptan group and in 3 
subjects in the prior placebo group. In addition, the following PCS laboratory test results were reported: 
3 subjects (2 prior tolvaptan and 1 prior placebo) had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 prior tolvaptan subject 
had  an  increase  in  triglycerides  and  3  prior  placebo  subjects  each  had  an  increase  in  sodium  and 
potassium and a decrease in glucose. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Changes  from  baseline  were  observed  for  vital  sign  parameters  throughout  the  trial;  however,  the 
changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful, with the exception of the TEAEs noted below.  
The incidence of PCS vital signs was similar between the treatment groups. For both phases the most 
frequently reported finding was diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤ 80 mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥ 
15 mmHg, which in Phase A occurred in 6 of 48 subjects (12.5%) in the tolvaptan group and 8 of 43 
subjects (18.6%) in the placebo group, and in Phase B occurred in 7 of 42 subjects (16.7%) in the prior 
tolvaptan group and 5 of 39 subjects (12.8%) in the prior placebo group. 
The following TEAEs related to vital signs were reported during Phase A of the trial (with a system organ 
class of investigations or vascular disorders): 
•  Orthostatic hypotension (10.4% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo) 
•  Hypertension (8.3% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
•  Hypotension (4.2% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
•  Weight decreased (4.2% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
• 
Peripheral coldness (2.1% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo) 
•  Hypertensive crisis (0.0% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo) 
The following TEAEs related to vital signs were reported during Phase B of the trial (with a system organ 
class of investigations or vascular disorders): 
•  Hypertension (9.5% prior tolvaptan versus 5.1% prior placebo) 
•  Orthostatic hypotension (7.1% prior tolvaptan versus 7.7% prior placebo) 
•  Hypotension (4.8% prior tolvaptan versus 7.7% prior placebo) 
•  Body temperature increased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 0.0% prior placebo) 
•  Heart rate decreased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 0.0% prior placebo) 
•  Heart rate increased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 2.6% prior placebo) 
•  Weight decreased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 12.8% prior placebo) 
• 
Peripheral coldness (0.0% prior tolvaptan versus 2.6% prior placebo) 
CHMP comment  
Overall, changes of laboratory values were reported as no clinically meaningful by the MAH. The 4 PCS 
elevations in hepatic laboratory occurred both in prior tolvaptan (1 serious AE) and in prior placebo

subjects, were considered unlikely related to tolvaptan by hepatic adjudication committee. However, due 
to the known hepatic toxicity of tolvaptan coming from adult’s studies, the correlation with study drug 
cannot be completely excluded also in the pediatric population and it is considered of concern. No cases 
of DILI meeting Hy’s Law laboratory criteria occurred. 
An imbalance in PCS increase of creatinine was reported in favour of placebo group in phase A of the 
trial (4 subjects vs 0, respectively). In phase B of the trial it was reported in 3 subjects both in tolvaptan 
and in placebo group. I addition, blood creatinine increase was also reported as one of the most common 
related-TEAEs  (16.7%  tolvaptan  versus  2.3%  placebo  in  phase  A  and  14.3%  prior  tolvaptan  versus 
12.8% prior placebo in phase B). In the MAH’s opinion, it can be considered a known, reversible, and 
expected effect secondary to the hemodinamic effect of the drug.  
Moreover,  3  subjects  (2  prior  tolvaptan  and  1  prior  placebo)  had  a  decrease  in  neutrophils,  1  prior 
tolvaptan subject had an increase in triglycerides, and 3 prior placebo subjects each had an increase in 
sodium and potassium and a decrease in glucose. 
A number of TEAEs related to vital signs were reported in phase A and were more frequent in tolvaptan 
group  than  in  placebo  group  (Orthostatic  hypotension,  Hypertension,  Hypotension,  Weight  decreased 
and Peripheral coldness). Most of them could be related to dehydration. A diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
≤  80  mmHg  and  decrease  from  baseline  ≥  15  mmHg  was  the  most  frequently  reported  finding  which 
occurred in both treatment groups and in a higher rate in subjects in the prior tolvaptan group (16.7%) 
than in prior placebo group (12.8%). 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
For this Article 46 procedure, the MAH submitted the final report for study  156-12-298, a Phase 3b, 
Two-part,  Multicenter,  One  Year  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Trial  of  the  Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Tolvaptan followed by a Two Year Open-label Extension in 
Child. 
Study design 
The trial comprised 2 phases: Phase A: 12 months, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 
to compare tolvaptan with placebo. It was open to subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 years, inclusive. 
Additionally,  in  accordance  with  the  PIP  requirements  subjects  aged  4  to  11  years  were  eligible  for 
participation  following  discussion  with  the  medical  monitor  who  met  criteria  for  entry  to  be  enrolled 
concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population. Qualified subjects who completed 
Phase  A were eligible to continue into  Phase  B,  an open-label phase  during which  subjects who  had 
completed Phase A of the trial received treatment with tolvaptan for 24 months in order to obtain safety 
and  efficacy  data  for  long-term  use  of  tolvaptan  in  children  and  adolescent  subjects  with  Autosomal 
Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).  
The study design with 12 months double-blind treatment duration could be considered sufficient to detect 
the potential benefit of tolvaptan over placebo in a pediatric population and is in accordance with the PIP 
requirement. However, it is of note that only descriptive statistics were provided and therefore no firm 
conclusion can be drawn on efficacy of tolvaptan in pediatric population. 
The diagnosis of ADPKD was defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria AND who 
had  at least 10 renal cysts, each of which  measured at least 0.5 cm confirmed upon MRI inspection. 
Subjects who were MRI-naive or under the age of 12 must have had at least 4 cysts (at least 1 cm in

size) confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection and this could be considered acceptable as MRI 
usually requires sedation in younger children.  
As is already done in TEMPO study with adult dosing, participants received a higher dose early in the 
day,  followed  by  a  lower  dose  administered  approximately  8–9  h  later,  in  order  to  obtain  maximal 
inhibition on waking and a gradual fall-off of effect during the night, when frequent urination would lead 
to  interruption  of  sleep  and  this  is  acceptable.  The  study  protocol  foreseen  a  questionnaire  to  be 
administered during Phase A to all subjects immediately after dosing to assess palatability and the easily 
to swallow the tablets. Unfortunately, no data is provided on this topic, although, in case the MAH will 
apply for an extension of indication, it could be important to know if there were patients who did not 
managed to take tablets as well as if tablets has been crushed prior the administration. 
Endpoints 
The coprimary endpoints were the change from baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) 
and specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A. 
The  key  secondary  endpoint  was  the  percent  change  from  Phase  A  baseline  in  height-adjusted  total 
kidney volume (htTKV) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months. 
A number of other secondary and exploratory endpoints were used. 
The choice of the co-primary endpoint is in line with the PIP requirements, but different to the primary 
endpoint used in the adult study (TEMPO) in which it was the rate of total kidney volume (TKV) change, 
which is considered an important endpoint considering that measures of renal volume seem to be linked 
to the progressive development of renal cysts  in ADPKD, and correlate with renal function. From  the 
other hand it is acknowledged that changes in TKV growth could be difficult to detect in pediatric subjects. 
However, the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) was 
the key secondary endpoint in the current pediatric study which could be considered as supportive. 
Demographic  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  tolvaptan  and  placebo.  A  low  number  of 
subjects had a genetic testing done (29,2 % in tolvaptan group vs 30.2% in plb group), of which only 2 
patients (14.3%) in the study group were ADPKD-1 positive. The majority of patients were aware of a 
positive  family  history  before  diagnosis  (89.6%  in  tolva  vs  90.7%  in  plb).  However,  it  is  not  clear  if 
patients without a family history had a genetic diagnosis.  
Overall, the mean total kidney volume was higher in  the placebo group (393.3 mL) than in tolvaptan 
group (286.1 mL) suggesting a possible more advanced disease in this group of patients that could be a 
bias, even though the low number of patients (13 in plb group) limits any firm conclusion. 
Efficacy 
A greater change from baseline in spot urine osmolality as well as in specific gravity at 1 week was 
observed in tolvaptan group than in placebo group and was maintained up to 1 month from baseline and 
this is reassuring. Results from the co-primary endpoints suggest that tolvaptan is effective in reducing 
urine osmolality and in increasing the output of water, as could be expected from its mechanism of action 
(inhibition of V2 receptor). Therefore, these endpoints indicates that tolvaptan can inhibit the V2 receptor 
also in the pediatric population in a similar manner than in adults. However, even if recent studies seem 
to support the link between vasopressin V2R signaling and renal disease progression in ADPKD (Devuys 
O., 2016), these results need to be translated in a clinical effect, in particular in a reduction of clinical 
progression. Moreover, the study lack of a statistical analysis and therefore these results could be only 
considered  as  descriptive.  Moreover,  a  greater  change  of  spot  urine  osmolality  was  observed  in  the 
placebo  arm  of  patients  aged  15-17,  suggesting  a  minor  effect  of  tolvaptan over  placebo  in  this  age 
group. A possible reason of such imbalance in results of co-primary endpoints in patients younger than

12 years should be provided or otherwise this lack should be justified  in case the MAH will apply for an 
extension of indication.   
A smaller mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 
12 to 17 years old was observed in the tolvaptan group (2.28%) versus the placebo group (6.11%) in 
Phase A. The results seem to be in line with those of the adult studies.  
Height- adjusted TKV (htTKV) on MRI is at present the most established imaging surrogate parameter 
for monitoring disease progression in adult with ADPKD and TKV was the one used as primary endpoint 
in TEMPO study supporting tolvaptan authorization in adult population. Despite the scarce knowledges 
relating to the htTKV value in pediatric population, it is reported in literature that the vast majority of 
children with ADPKD maintained normal kidney function despite progressive structural kidney disease, 
thus emphasizing the great importance of total kidney volume (TKV) as a measurable outcome of early 
disease progression and the primary focus of therapeutic intervention in the pediatric ADPKD population 
(M. A. Cadnapaphornchai, 2017). 
 Even if difficulties in doing MRI mainly in younger and/or non-cooperative children who require sedation 
are acknowledged, only data from 57 patients were provided, limiting the robustness of these results in 
support of the co-primary endpoints. Data from ultrasound evaluation in 9 patients < 12 years old have 
been provided, which seem to be no sufficiently supportive.  
A number of other secondary endpoints have been explored. Overall, they seem to be in line with co-
primary and key secondary endpoints. The mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) 
showed a difference between tolvaptan group and placebo when analyzed from week 1 to month 12 due 
to the hemodynamic effect. However, no difference between tolvaptan and placebo group in the mean 
change in renal function was observed in 15 to 17 years age group, while the change was more evident 
in females. 
Among the secondary endpoints there were PD endpoints such as urine volume (including 24-hour fluid 
volume), fluid intake and fluid balance, sodium, creatinine, and free water clearance during dense PK 
sampling (after at least 1 month). 
Other endpoints included tolvaptan PK parameters following dense PK sampling  
A  high  percentage of  patients  downgraded  to  a  lower  dose  of  that  foreseen  after  1  month  this  could 
suggest occurrence of safety concerns or in any case raises doubts on the adequateness of the starting 
dose. The reasons that lead to downgrade the dose should be provided in case the MAH will apply for an 
extension of indication.    
Moreover, in paediatric patients dosed with 45 mg (30/15 mg, N=3) and 60 mg (45/15 mg, N=5) after 
one month of treatment, showed Cmax values higher than in adults after the morning dose. Therefore, 
an adequate definition and a comprehensive discussion of the selected dose, including the starting one, 
is expected in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.  
Safety 
Overall, the safety profile of tolvaptan seems to be in line with that observed in adults (with the exception 
of  cough)  and  associated  with  its  aquaretic  properties.  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  in  the 
tolvaptan  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  in  phase  A  were:  polyuria  (27.1%  tolvaptan  versus  4.7% 
placebo), Blood creatinine increased (18.8% vs 4.7%), pollakiuria (18.8% vs 0.0%), cough (14.6% vs 
11.6%),  nocturia  (14.6%  vs  7.0%),  thirst  (14.6%  vs  4.7%),  abdominal  pain  (12.5%  vs  7.0%), 
constipation (10.4% vs 2.3%), orthostatic hypotension (10.4% vs 0.0% placebo), polydipsia (10.4% vs 
2.3%),  abdominal  pain  upper  (10.4%  vs  9.3%).  The  incidence  of  aquaretic  TEAEs  and  dehydration-

related TEAEs was higher in the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group (64.4% vs 16.3% and 35.4% 
vs 14%). These AEs are expected due to the mechanism of action of the drug and to the known safety 
profile  in  adult  patients  and  are  reflected  in  the  SmPC,  however  they  are  considered  of  concern  in  a 
pediatric population, mainly in younger patients, more sensitive to acquaretic AEs.  
The frequency of serious TEAEs was lower in the tolvaptan group both in Phase A and B. Serious adverse 
events  were  reported  in  1  patient  in  phase  A  in  tolvaptan  group  (viral  pericarditis)  which  was 
considered moderate in intensity and not related by the investigator and in 7 patients in phase B in prior 
tolvaptan group of which the event of ulcerative colitis was reported as not related by the investigator. 
However, no information on seriousness and relationship with study drug were reported about the other 
serious adverse events in phase B. No death was reported in this trial. 
In phase A, only one subject in the tolvaptan group discontinued IMP due to pollakiuria and the event 
was assessed by the investigator as moderate in severity and as related to the IMP. Three subjects in 
Phase B discontinued IMP due to eating disorder, polyuria, and liver function test increased. All events 
were assessed by the investigator as moderate severity and the event of polyuria was assessed as related 
to the IMP. 
Changes of laboratory values were reported as no clinically meaningful by the MAH. No cases of  DILI 
meeting Hy’s Law laboratory criteria occurred. 4 PCS elevations in hepatic laboratory occurred both in 
prior tolvaptan (1 serious AE) and in prior placebo subjects, were considered unlikely related to tolvaptan 
by hepatic adjudication committee. One serious TEAE of ALT increased in 1 subject and serious TEAEs of 
ALT and AST increased in 1 subject were all assessed by the investigator as related to the IM. Therefore, 
considering  the  known  hepatic  toxicity  of  tolvaptan  coming  from  adult’s  studies,  the  correlation  with 
study drug cannot be excluded also in the pediatric population and it is considered of concern in such 
population.  
An imbalance in PCS increase of creatinine was reported in favour of placebo group in phase A of the 
trial (4 subjects vs 0, respectively). In phase B of the trial it was reported in 3 subjects both in tolvaptan 
and in placebo group. In addition, blood creatinine increase was also reported as one of the most common 
related-TEAEs  (16.7%  tolvaptan  versus  2.3%  placebo  in  phase  A  and  14.3%  prior  tolvaptan  versus 
12.8% prior placebo in phase B). In the MAH’s opinion, it can be considered a known, reversible, and 
expected  effect  secondary  to  the  haemodynamic  effect  of  the  drug.  Moreover,  3  subjects  (2  prior 
tolvaptan and 1 prior placebo) had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 prior tolvaptan subject had an increase 
in  triglycerides,  and  3  prior  placebo  subjects  each  had  an  increase  in  sodium  and  potassium  and  a 
decrease in glucose. 
A number of TEAEs related to vital signs were reported in phase A and were more frequent in tolvaptan 
group  than  in  placebo  group  (Orthostatic  hypotension,  Hypertension,  Hypotension,  Weight  decreased 
and Peripheral coldness). Most of them, such as orthostatic hypotension, could be related to dehydration 
and may be secondary to inadequate fluid intake to replace fluid loss. However, these effects could be 
less  tolerated  in  children  and  also  more  harmful.  A  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  ≤  80  mmHg  and 
decrease from baseline ≥ 15 mmHg was the most frequently reported finding which occurred in both 
treatment  groups  and  in a  higher  rate  in  subjects in  the  prior  tolvaptan  group  (16.7%) than  in  prior 
placebo group (12.8%).  
The MAH proposes no adjustments of the SmPC.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study results indicate that tolvaptan is able to inhibit the V2 receptor also in the paediatric population in 
a similar manner than in adult one with potential beneficial effects. However, the limited sample size, 
the lack of a formal statistical analysis limit the robustness of the conclusion. Importantly, study results 
do not allow an adequate definition of the dose, this is expected to be addressed in case the MAH will 
decide to submit these data in the context of a variation. The safety profile seems to be similar to that 
of the adults (with few new signals like cough) and characterized mostly by aquaretic properties and 
their  relative  effects,  such  as  orthostatic  hypotension,  which  may  be  less  tolerated  by  a  paediatric 
population and also more harmful. Moreover, hepatic toxicity is also of concern in a paediatric population.

No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited, autosomal recessive disease characterized by a deficiency in the 
intracellular liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH catalyses the conversion of the essential 
amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine, and this enzymatic activity is facilitated by tetrahydrobiopterin 
(BH4). PAH deficiency results in an abnormally elevated concentrations of phenylalanine, which is toxic to 
the brain (Kaufman, 1989).  
High phenylalanine levels during infancy and early childhood cause profound cognitive and developmental 
defects, and poorly controlled blood phenylalanine levels in older children and adolescents are associated 
with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and behavioural problems (Moyle, 2007; 
Moyle, 2007; Pietz, 1997; Smith, 2000; Waisbren, 1999; Waisbren, 2007; Stemerdink, 2000). With 
new-born screening followed by dietary phenylalanine-restriction, the most severe manifestation of the 
disease — mental retardation — is prevented.  
However, most adults with PKU do not adhere to the dietary phenylalanine restriction to control blood 
phenylalanine levels; 79% of adolescents and 78% of adults with PKU have blood phenylalanine levels 
above the recommended target range of 60-600 μmol/L (Waisbren, 2007; Walter, 2002). Uncontrolled 
blood phenylalanine levels in adulthood are associated with executive dysfunction, and a variety of 
behavioural and psychiatric problems (Moyle, 2007; Pietz, 1997; Smith, 2000; Waisbren, 1999).  
Adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) may experience neurologic and psychiatric disorders, including 
intellectual disability, anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive dysfunction. For most of the adult patients 
this will impact the quality of life, especially as they encounter problems in social interactions. In contrast, 
there are also adult PKU patients who do not have their blood phenylalanine levels checked regularly or 
even are lost on follow-up.  
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
The prevalence of PKU shows considerable geographic variation. The estimated prevalence of PKU in 
adults in the European Community is 1:10,000 (van Spronsen, 2017), ranging from 0.1:10,000 in Finland 
to 2.2:10,000 in Slovenia (Loeber, 2007; Guldberg, 1995; Van Spronsen, 2017). The prevalence of PKU 
in the United States is estimated to be 0.67:10,000 (NIHCDP, 2001). As a result of newborn screening 
efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all individuals with PKU under the age of 40 
are diagnosed at birth and treatment is implemented soon thereafter. In Northern Europe, there is a 
relative large proportion (around 60%) of patients with the severe form of PKU. In Southern Europe this 
proportion is around 40%. Patients with this more severe form of PKU do not have residual PAH enzyme 
activity and do not respond to sapropterin treatment, the synthetic cofactor for the PAH enzyme.

2.1.2.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
PAH is most abundant in the liver cells and catalyses the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine (Tyr) 
in the presence of the cofactor BH4. Absent or non-functional PAH activity prevents or significantly 
reduces the metabolism of phenylalanine to Tyr. As a result, concentrations of phenylalanine build up in 
the liver and in the blood, causing hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA). Phenylalanine is also able to cross the 
blood-brain barrier via L-type amino acid carriers, which is the principal cause of HPA toxicity. These 
physiological mechanisms are summarized visually in Figure 1.

The principal consequences of HPA toxicity are neurological and psychiatric pathology and psychological 
and neurocognitive dysfunction (Moyle, 2007a; Moyle, 2007b, Pietz, 1997; Smith, 2000; Waisbren, 
1999; Gassio, 2003). HPA and prolonged medical nutrition therapy (MNT) can also result in nutritional 
deficits, dysfunctional metabolic control, and bone pathology (Enns, 2010). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
In patients with PKU, HPA toxicity is principally caused by elevated phenylalanine levels in the brain which 
is toxic to the central nervous system (CNS) and can, especially in children, result in neurological and 
psychiatric pathology and psychological and neurocognitive dysfunction (Bilder, 2016; Bilder, 2017; 
NPKUA, 2014):  
•  Neurological pathology: seizures, tremor, migraine, and probably long-term neurodegeneration 
• 
• 
Psychiatric: depression, anxiety 
Psychological: mood, inattention, impulsivity, confusion, anger, vitality, tiredness, agoraphobia 
•  Neurocognitive: executive function, verbal memory, inhibitory control, working memory, 
cognitive flexibility 
o  Executive function includes planning, problem solving, information processing, bringing 
previous experience to bear on activities, and sustained attention 
The prevalence of psychiatric and neurologic symptoms in adults with PKU is higher than the US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates for disease prevalence in adults in the general population (NIMH, 
2013). Specifically, 49% of adults with PKU reported inattention symptoms versus 4% of adults in the 
general population who reported ADHD; 22% of adults with PKU reported anxiety symptoms versus 3% 
of adults in the general population who reported generalized anxiety disorder; and 18% of adults with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 11/110 
 
 
 
 
PKU reported depression symptoms versus 7% of adults in the general population who reported major 
depressive disorder.  
Evidence from a systematic literature review and meta-analysis found that in adults executive functioning 
impairment impacts daily life by interfering with the ability to perform basic cognitive tasks such as 
focusing, memory, planning, and impulse control. These tasks play a critical role in fulfilling 
responsibilities of adulthood such as acquiring/maintaining employment, managing money, raising a 
family, and driving (Bilder, 2016). These findings suggest that neuropsychiatric and executive functioning 
deficits are reversible in adults with PKU. The mental state of patients is influenced by their executive 
function, which in turn impacts their ability to plan, organize, and follow the severe phenylalanine 
restriction + MNT, and their overall quality of life. Higher lifetime rather than concurrent 
phenylalanine-levels were related to poorer social outcomes. The influence of phenylalanine during 
childhood and early adolescence seems to be important for social cognitive functioning and social skills 
later in life (Jahja, 2016). Interestingly, average phenylalanine levels have been reported to be 
significantly correlated with scores for psychoticism and psychiatric symptom intensity, while better 
phenylalanine control during childhood was associated with better mood during adulthood. Similarly, 
depression and anxiety scores were positively correlated with the age at diet initiation and childhood 
phenylalanine levels, respectively. Equally, in other studies, psychiatric disturbance, anxiety and 
depression were neither associated with current dietary status, nor with concurrent or historical 
phenylalanine levels (Burlina, 2019).  
In addition, HPA and prolonged MNT can also result in nutritional deficits (Enns, 2010), dysfunctional 
metabolic control, and bone pathology (Hoeks, 2009; Camp, 2014; Hvas, 2006; Schulz, 1995; 
Sarkissian, 2009) and increased diabetic and cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased lipids, 
homocysteine, and body mass index [BMI]) (Moseley, 2002; Macleod, 2010). 
2.1.4.  Management 
The aim of PKU management is to identify patients at birth, to control their HPA, and to retain neurological 
health (IQ) and neurocognitive function as adults. Although various country-specific guidelines have been 
developed over the last few years, the first consensus pan-European PKU guidelines were published in 
2017 (van Spronsen, 2017; van Wegberg, 2017). These guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PKU 
were developed by 19 medical specialists in the field, throughout Europe, under the auspices of the 
European Society for phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders (ESPKU). 
There are two recommendations pertinent to adults: 
• 
• 
Lifelong treatment is recommended for any patient with PKU whose blood phenylalanine levels 
are greater than 600 μmol/L; all adults with PKU should have lifelong, systematic follow up in 
specialized metabolic centres due to specific risks which may occur during adulthood. 
In treated PKU patients aged >12 years (non-pregnant), the target blood phenylalanine levels are 
120 to 600 μmol/L.  
Phenylalanine is one of 8 essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized de novo in the human body. 
Thus, in the general population, physiological requirements for phenylalanine are met exclusively by 
dietary protein intake. Therefore, patients with PKU must primarily control their blood phenylalanine 
levels by controlling their dietary phenylalanine intake through the following methods, referred to as 
MNT: 
•  Severe natural protein restriction according to individual phenylalanine tolerance 
• 
Low protein phenylalanine-free synthetic food to meet energy requirements 
Assessment report

• 
Phenylalanine-free L-amino acid supplements (usually with added vitamins and minerals) to meet 
protein and non-protein requirements 
Current treatment strategies available in Europe for PKU patients include: 
•  MNT in conjunction with treatment with sapropterin. 
Phenylalanine concentration categories considered normal, requiring treatment, and targets for the 
management of treated patients with PKU in Europe are presented in Table 1.

An online survey, completed by 81 healthcare providers (HCPs) across 24 countries, carried out on behalf 
of the European PKU group, indicated that only 28% of adults with PKU were currently achieving 
phenylalanine control of less 600 μmol/L (the number of HCPs who responded to this question was 43/81) 
(Trefz, 2015). In a PKU systematic review and meta-analysis, even amongst those adults who received 
early treatment with continuous MNT (defined in most included publications as initiating a 
low-phenylalanine diet within 90 days of birth), mean blood phenylalanine levels ranged from 709 to 1053 
μmol/L, indicating that there are significant challenges associated with the use of MNT over the long term. 
Patients with the more severe form of PKU, with untreated blood phenylalanine levels of >1200 μmol/L, 
are unlikely to achieve control with the current available treatment options; according to the online 
survey from 81 HCPs in the 24 European countries, this comprises 66% of adults with "classical" PKU 
(Trefz, 2015). While the current EU upper threshold for phenylalanine control is 600 μmol/L, this upper 
threshold may be reduced, as more evidence emerges regarding the clinical benefit of the reduction in 
blood phenylalanine levels (e.g., the 2014 American College of Molecular Genetics and Genomics [ACMG] 
guidelines recommend life-long management of blood phenylalanine levels under 360 μmol/L) (Vockley, 
2014).  
About the product 
Pegvaliase is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL), derived from the 
Cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis expressed in E coli. The purpose of the PEGylation of rAvPAL is to 
reduce immune recognition as rAvPAL is a bacterial protein and to increase the half-life. 
Pegvaliase converts phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid that are metabolized by the liver 
and excreted in the urine, respectively. Pegvaliase reduces blood phenylalanine levels and as such 
substitutes for the deficient PAH enzyme. Contrary to PAH which act intracellular and is modulated by 
cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pegvaliase acts in the blood compartment independent from BH4.  
The claimed indication for Palynziq was for the treatment of adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have 
inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater than 600 µmol/l) despite prior 
management with available treatment options including sapropterin.  
The indication approved by the CHMP was for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 
16 years and older who have inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater 
than 600 µmol/l l) despite prior management with available treatment options.

The recommended starting dosage of pegvaliase is 2.5 mg administered once per week for 4 weeks. The 
dosage should be escalated in a step wise manner based on acceptable tolerability to reach appropriate 
maintenance dosage once daily. 
The maintenance dosage is the lowest effective dosage to achieve and maintain blood phenylalanine 
control. After a minimum of 24 weeks on 20 mg/day, the dosage may be further adjusted (up titration) up 
to 40 mg/day. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant did not request scientific advice in the EU. The only other authorised medical treatment for 
PKU is sapropterin (Kuvan) for which the MAH is also BioMarin. Prior to the approval of sapropterin, the 
applicant had received scientific advice in which blood phenylalanine levels were accepted as a surrogate 
endpoint for the treatment of PKU patients. The same endpoint was used during the clinical development 
of pegvaliase. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection in pre-filled syringe containing 2.5 mg, 10 mg 
or 20 mg of pegvaliase as active substance. Pegvaliase is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL), derived from the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis expressed in Escherichia 
coli (E. coli). During manufacture, the rAvPAL protein is purified and subsequently PEGylated with 20 kDa 
linear NHS methoxypolyethylene glycol (NHS-PEG), forming the active substance, pegvaliase 
(rAvPAL-PEG). The purpose of the PEGylation of rAvPAL is to reduce immune recognition as rAvPAL is a 
bacterial protein and to increase the protein’s half-life. 
Other ingredients are: trometamol, trometamol hydrochloride, sodium chloride, trans-cinnamic acid and 
water for injections.  
The product is available in 1 mL pre-filled syringe made of Type I borosilicate glass, equipped with a 
stainless steel 26 gauge needle, needle safety device, polypropylene plunger rod, and chlorobutyl rubber 
syringe stopper with fluoropolymer coating. The automatic needle guard is composed of a polycarbonate 
transparent needle guard and a stainless steel spring inside the needle guard. After injection, the spring 
expands causing the needle to be covered by the needle guard. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy which works by converting phenylalanine (Phe) to trans–
cinnamic acid and ammonia. Enzyme activity is attributed to the electrophilic prosthetic 
4-methylideneimidazole–5–one (MIO) group. 
The rAvPAL protein is a homotetramer containing 567 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 
62 kDa per monomer. Two point mutations, converting cysteine residues into serine residues, have been 
introduced into the native AvPAL sequence to prevent aggregation via intramolecular disulfide formation. 
After translation, the residues Ala 167, Ser 168, and Gly 169 undergo autocatalytic dehydration and 
cyclization in order to form an electrophilic prosthetic 4-methylideneimidazole–5–one (MIO) group, which 
is essential for rAvPAL enzyme activity. PEGylation refers to the conjugation of the exposed lysines of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 14/110 
 
 
 
 
rAvPAL protein with linear ~20 kDa methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) that has been activated with an 
N-hydroxysuccinimide active ester (NHS–PEG). 
The rAvPAL homotetramer contains 72 lysine (K) groups (18 per monomer), of which approximately 48 
(12 per monomer) have some level of surface exposure for the lysine ε-amino group by which the PEG is 
linked. The anticipated extent of PEGylation is approximately 8-9 PEGs per monomer. The total molecular 
weight of pegvaliase is ~1,000 kDa. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. 
rAvPAL protein is produced in recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Cells from the working cell bank or 
master cell bank are expanded in shake flasks followed by a seed fermenter and a production fermenter 
using a batch-fed process. At the end of the fermentation the cells are harvested by centrifugation and the 
resulting cell paste can be either forward processed or frozen and stored. 
The cell paste is re-suspended and homogenized to lyse the cells. The lysate is heated, diluted and 
clarified by centrifugation and multi-stage filtration. The clarified lysate is purified and the bulk rAvPAL is 
frozen in bags for long-term storage.  
NHS-PEG is filtered, purified by recrystallization and dried to yield pure NHS-PEG. rAvPAL is then used as 
a starting material for the next step, which involves the PEGylation of rAvPAL with NHS-PEG. 
The bulk rAvPAL is pooled and subsequently diafiltered. The pegvaliase FBDS is stored in single-use 10 L 
bags that comply with Ph. Eur. requirements and are received from the supplier sterilized and ready for 
use. The FBDS storage container is a multi-layered bag consisting of polyester elastomer coextruded with 
an ethyl vinyl alcohol barrier layer, and an ultra-low density polyethylene product contact layer. An 
evaluation of materials was performed to assess the leachables/extractables profile. A summary of the 
risk assessment for the container closure system is provided and it was found acceptable. 
Pegvaliase FBDS lots (20 mg/mL) may be diluted to 5 mg/mL, as needed, for the production of the 2.5 mg 
/ 0.5 mL syringe finished product presentation through the addition of formulation buffer. After diluting, 
the material is mixed and 0.2 μm filtered into the FBDS storage bag. The diluted FBDS may be processed 
further or stored.  
The description of the manufacturing process is sufficiently detailed. Pooling strategy and manufacturing 
scale have been appropriately indicated. Target values and proven acceptable ranges are tabulated for 
critical and key operating parameters. In-process controls (IPCs) have been defined to ensure 
appropriate performance of the manufacturing process.  
Control of materials 
The construction and preparation of the expression plasmid and generation of the production cell line is 
described in sufficient detail. The rAvPAL expression vector was created by conventional molecular 
cloning techniques.  
The Master Cell Bank (MCB) and one Working Cell Bank (WCB) were characterized in accordance with ICH 
Q5B and ICH Q5D guidance. The tests performed and results are briefly described in test reports. 
Adequate protocols for stability monitoring of the MCB and WCB and establishment and control of future 
WCBs have been provided. 
The composition of media used during seed fermenter operations and production as well as the 
composition of buffers are adequately described. Specifications for non-compendial ingredients were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 15/110 
 
 
 
provided. No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of pegvaliase. Resins are 
appropriately approved before use. 
In the initial application NHS-PEG was defined as a starting material (raw material), which was not 
considered appropriate during CHMP review. NHS-PEG was re-classified as an intermediate in the 
manufacturing process and appropriate quality controls were established.  Information to support this 
classification change was provided and considered acceptable.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy for pegvaliase FBDS is implemented by means of specifications, manufacturing 
process controls and an in-process testing plan. The rationale for designating critical process parameters 
(CPPs) as well as in-process controls is briefly discussed in this section. 
The applicant has used a combination of traditional and enhanced approaches to process development. 
Process development and the creation of a control system strategy were structured around critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) of rAvPAL intermediate and pegvaliase FBDS. CPPs are defined as a process parameter 
whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or 
controlled while a critical process attributes (CPA) is a direct measure or indicator of the performance for 
a critical step as it relates to a process intermediate or product quality. The rationale for assigning a 
process parameter or attribute as critical is clearly described.  
An overview of all CPP/CPA with the Proven Acceptable Range (PAR) and Normal Operating Ranges (NOR) 
for each parameter/attribute is provided along with a summary of the supporting data used to justify 
these ranges. For most CPPs/CPAs the PARs are identical to the NORs and these ranges are supported by 
min/max data of commercial scale batches and sometimes by small scale studies as well. For a limited 
number of CPP/CPA the PARs are based on small scale studies only. Reports show that these PARs are 
adequately substantiated. 
N-Hydroxysuccinimide-activated linear methoxyPEG (mPEG-NHS or NHS-PEG) reagent which has a 
hexanoic acid-derived linker is an intermediate in the production of pegvaliase. The chemical structure of 
NHS-PEG used in the PEGylation reaction is shown Figure 2.  
Figure 2: Chemical structure of NHS-PEG 
Recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL) is defined as a second intermediate.  
Analytical methods used for the control of the rAvPAL intermediate have been described. Both a concise 
overview and comprehensive SOP for each method have been provided. The test methods are 
appropriately validated and suited for their purpose.  
Process validation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 16/110 
 
 
 
 
The performance qualification of the commercial manufacturing process was performed by successfully 
manufacturing three formulated bulk active substance batches using normal processing parameter set 
points and conditions. The limit of in vitro cell age (LCA) was demonstrated by manufacturing data. 
Results are compiled in detailed PPQ reports and substantiate that the full scale commercial process 
performs effectively and is able to produce an active substance meeting its predetermined controls and 
acceptance criteria. 
Process validation was completed and the applicant presented the in-process testing results and FBDS 
release testing results. These results demonstrate the manufacturing process for pegvaliase is controlled 
and validated, resulting in FBDS that meets in-process and release testing criteria. Comparability of the 
modified process with the previous process has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The lifetime of the resins used in the chromatographic purification operations was properly validated at 
laboratory scale. The provided data are satisfactory and support the proposed lifetimes. Clear protocols 
for confirmation of the proposed lifetimes at production scale are provided.  
Hold times of process intermediates are defined and validation data were submitted. Proposed hold times 
are mainly based on historical large scale data.  
Adequate validation data are provided for reprocessing, impurity clearance and shipping. The pegvaliase 
active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately.  
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. 
Over the course of clinical development, the manufacturing process was optimized in order to increase 
purity and yields, streamline manufacturing operations, optimize utilization of critical raw materials and 
control critical quality attributes for rAvPAL enzyme (a critical intermediate) and pegvaliase FBDS.  
The comparability assessment assessed via batch analysis (release testing), stability analysis, and 
additional characterization studies for product manufactured throughout development was found 
acceptable. 
The material produced using the proposed commercial manufacturing was used to support the entire 
Phase III clinical trial.  
Characterisation 
The rAvPAL protein intermediate was part of pegvaliase FBDS characterization analysis. This is because 
pegvaliase is a highly PEGylated protein, consisting of more PEG than protein on a mass basis. 
Furthermore, PEG is also polydisperse, i.e., yielding a variety of PEG masses attached to each PEGylation 
site. These features of pegvaliase make it difficult to characterize the PEGylated pegvaliase protein 
structure.  
Most of the characterization studies on rAvPAL intermediate were performed on the reference 
preparation, clinical batches and 3 PPQ batches.  
The primary structure of rAvPAL was confirmed by molecular mass spectrometry, N terminal sequencing, 
C-terminal sequencing and peptide mapping with LC-MS detection. Peptide profiles were generated on a 
RP-HPLC system and the active site peptide was detected using ESI-TOF-MS. 
Disulfide/free-sulfhydryl determination was conducted on rAvPAL using RP-HPLC analysis to analyse the 
primary structure of the rAvPAL monomer.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 17/110 
 
 
 
Heterogeneity of rAvPAL was studied by a range of methods.  
Size variants have been analyzed by SDS-CGE, SDS-PAGE, Western blots, SEC and dynamic light 
scattering.  
Peptide mapping was performed using mass spectrometry. 
Biological activity was adequately addressed by measuring the specific activity, kcat and Km test 
methods.  
Almost all characterization studies on pegvaliase active substance were performed on the reference 
preparation, three clinical batches and three PPQ batches. 
A SEC-MALS system was used to verify the molecular weights and extent of PEGylation of the pegvaliase 
lots.  
Subtractive tryptic mapping assays with UV detection or MS detection were used to identify PEGylated 
lysine residues and the degree of their PEG occupancies.  
Pegvaliase Dimers and multimers were studied by SEC-HPLC.  
Cryo TEM and SEC-MALS in non-denaturing and denaturing conditions were used to characterise the 
tertiary and quaternary structure of the pegylated protein.  
The pegvaliase structure was further characterized by viscosity measurements, circular dichroism, nano 
differential scanning calorimetry and the enzymatic assay.  
Consistent results were obtained between the batches included in these studies for the quality attributes 
studied. 
Process related impurities (Host Cell Protein (HCP) and DNA, endotoxin, antifoam, 
isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyroanoside, kanamycin, polysorbate 80, free pegvaliase, free PEG, free 
N-Hydroxysuccinimide, ammonium sulfate and other PEG-related impurities) and product related 
impurities were appropriately discussed and evaluated. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes all the critical quality attributes that affect the manufacturing 
and quality of the finished product. Quality Control tests for batch release include: safety (bacterial 
endotoxin and bioburden), identity, potency (specific activity), purity and impurities and several other 
general tests. 
Formulated bulk active substance specification has been revised during the procedure. Clear graphical 
presentations are presented to support justification of acceptance criteria. The applicant commits to 
re-evaluate specifications based on experience gathered with further commercial lots and to amend the 
limits when appropriate. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data 75 batches of development and commercial batches of the active substance were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.

Reference materials 
Qualification data for the reference materials (rAvPAL intermediate and pegvaliase) used to date, 
including results of release tests as well as characterisation data, were submitted. Preparation and 
qualification of future reference materials is sufficiently described. The reference stability protocols are 
adequate and stability data for the current reference materials demonstrate that these reference 
preparations are stable for the observed period. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
life in the proposed container. 
Long-term and accelerated stability studies have been conducted to qualify the expiry period for rAvPAL 
intermediate. The rAvPAL lots included in the stability assessment include a PPQ batch and subsequent 
commercial process batches. For the long term storage condition, no significant trends were observed. 
Stability studies have been completed and support the proposed holding time of the rAvPAL Intermediate. 
In accordance with ICH Q5C, formal stability studies for pegvaliase FBDS were conducted on 15 batches 
including diluted and undiluted FBDS batches at recommended long term and accelerated storage 
conditions. The proposed storage time of pegvaliase FBDS is a cumulative 12 month expiry at the 
recommended long term storage condition. 
 At the recommended storage condition no trends were observed. The available stability data support the 
proposed shelf-life. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Pegvaliase finished product is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution contained in single use, 
glass prefilled syringe (PFS) with staked needle for subcutaneous injection. 
The three different strength presentations are provided to support the dosing regimen of pegvaliase, 
which includes induction, titration, and maintenance (I/T/M) stages to achieve the required therapeutic 
dose. 
The primary container closure consists of a 1 mL long Type I borosilicate glass prefilled syringe with a 
stainless steel staked needle. The closure consists of a stopper and a rigid needle shield. The syringe is 
equipped with functional secondary packaging components including the plunger rod and needle safety 
device. Each syringe is packaged in a heat-sealed tray and an outer carton. 
Each PFS contains a slight overfill amount to ensure the correct volume is delivered upon injection.  
The formulation of the finished product is the same as the active substance. Compatibility is 
demonstrated through formulation development studies which aimed to evaluate various stabilizing 
excipients for pegvaliase at long-term storage and accelerated temperature conditions. Pegvaliase 
finished product is physically and chemically compatible with the selected PFS primary container closure 
system.  
The finished product solution is rather viscous, as indicated in the SmPC.  
The same formulation was used in all Phase 1 through Phase 3 clinical studies for pegvaliase. During early 
clinical development, pegvaliase finished product was presented in a vial container closure system. The 
transition to a PFS was implemented to simplify the administration for the patient, improve patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 19/110 
 
 
 
compliance with treatment, and reduce the potential for medication errors. During the Phase III clinical 
studies, both finished product vials and PFS were used. 
Sufficient information on the different versions of the vial and pre-filled-syringe manufacturing processes 
developments are provided (tables not reproduced in this AR). Differences apply to manual or automated 
steps, fill volumes, batch sizes and holding times. 
While trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) used in the finished product formulation in itself may be a new excipient 
it is relevant to consider that t-CA is generated ‘in situ’ after addition of a well-known excipient. Thus 
additional requirements for novel excipients with respect to details on its manufacture, specification and 
stability for an excipient as added to the formulation would not be appropriate. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The Pegvaliase finished product primary manufacturing process description consists of thawing of FBDS at 
the active substance manufacturing site, until preparation of the fill line, pre and sterile filtration of the 
active substance, ‘recombination’ or pooling of filtered active substance and filling into syringes followed 
by stoppering of the syringes and an inspection process. 
A process performance qualification (PPQ) of the pegvaliase finished product primary manufacturing 
process was conducted. The PPQ verified that CPPs were within the defined ranges and target setpoints as 
defined in approved batch records and standard operating procedures. PPQ batches were subjected to 
routine inspection and finished product release testing including container closure testing. In addition, 
extra non-routine in-process samples were also collected and tested including samples to demonstrate 
sterility, microbial control and content uniformity throughout the primary manufacturing process.  
The filling duration has been qualified through the successful completion of media fill challenges for the fill 
line equipment. 
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process 
controls are adequate. 
Product specification 
The analytical specifications for the finished product are primarily based on compendial requirements 
and/or the specifications for pegvaliase FBDS, as the filling process is not expected to cause significant 
changes to safety, identity, strength, quality, purity, potency, and composition attributes of pegvaliase. 
Functionality specifications for the syringe are based on human factors analysis and design input 
requirements. The proposed acceptance criteria are presented alongside the historical ranges, averages, 
and standard deviations and their justification for each parameter.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Most of the analytical methods for pegvaliase finished product are also used for pegvaliase FBDS.  
Batch analysis 
Analysis results of all development and full scale commercial batches are provided (approximately 80 
batches). Date of manufacture, active substance batch, strength, container manufacturing facility and 
disposition of the batches were indicated. 
The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Assessment report

Reference materials 
Reference standards are the same as those described for the active substance controls. 
Stability of the product 
A 2-year shelf-life at 2 - 8 °C is proposed for the finished product. The claim is based on 24 months data 
on primary batches, which are considered representative for the commercial presentation.  
A bracketing approach as defined in ICH Q1D was used for evaluating the stability of the four PPQ 
batches. The use of bracketing is justified as it is applied to identical or closely related formulations and 
in a situation where the same container closure system is used for all presentations and either the 
container size or fill volume varies while the other remains constant.  
The analytical methods used to monitor pegvaliase finished product stability are the same methods used 
for the finished product release. Container closure integrity (CCI) testing by vacuum decay is performed 
in lieu of sterility testing to ensure sterility of the product during the finished product shelf-life. 
For the 5 ± 3 °C storage condition, the stability batches conform to all acceptance criteria through 24 
months of storage.  
Protocols for studies on additional batches are supplied and do not raise any issues. 
The proposed shelf-life of 2 years at 5°C ± 3°C for the finished product is considered to be justified. 
Available data at 25±2°C/60±5% RH also supports instances of short-term excursions outside the label 
storage conditions. The company proposes an in use claim for storage outside the refrigerator for a single 
period up to 30 days, which is considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Pegvaliase is manufactured using an enzyme expressed in E. coli and no reagents or raw materials used 
in the production are derived from human or animal sources.

Not applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and its 
manufacturing process. 
However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical program was designed to support the chronic use of pegvaliase for PKU patients 16 years 
of age and older. The studies completed included single and repeat-dose pharmacodynamic (PD), safety 
pharmacology, toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicity evaluations in BTBRPahenu2 (ENU2) mice, and normal rats 
and monkeys. Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. The 
pharmacological activity of pegvaliase was demonstrated in a rodent model of PKU, the ENU2 mouse. 
ENU2 mice exhibit HPA similar to PKU patients and were utilized to help determine initial dose levels of 
pegvaliase for clinical trials. All non-clinical studies used the subcutaneous (SC) route of administration. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The ability of pegvaliase to cleave phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid (TCA) and ammonia was 
determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 290nM as an indicator of the presence of TCA 
demonstrating that pegvaliase is able to convert phenylalanine to the specified constituent parts  (Study 
QC-1104-A, see also Quality Section of this report). 
The primary PD of pegvaliase was evaluated in the ENU2 mouse model. This mouse exhibits 
characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe 
concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µM/L) and hypopigmentation. Hypopigmentation is a phenotypic change 
caused by concentration-dependent Phe inhibition of melanin biosynthesis. Treatment of the 
hyperphenylalaninemia results in a progressive coat colour change in the ENU2 mouse. 
In Study 0164-06-019, ENU2 Mice were administered either 0.2 or 1 IU avPAL, pegylated avPAL or 1 IU 
pegylated rtPAL (a pegylated PAL derived from Rhodosporidium toruiedise). Pegvaliase dose dependently 
decreased plasma phenylalanine and was more effective than either avPAL or rtPAL at any dose.  
Similarly in Study 0165-06-057, weekly dosing up to 57 days using 0.25, 1 or 4 IU pegylatedAvPAL 
(wild-type and a mutant variant) in ENU2 mice resulted in a dose dependent decrease of serum 
phenylalanine. Plasma Phe levels decreased to less than 500 μM Phe in male ENU2 mice administered two 
weekly injections of the PEGylated AvPAL mutant. A transient attenuated response was seen during 
weeks 3 through 7 due to anti-drug-antibodies. Pharmacological activity returned after the eighth 
administration as evidenced by stable reduced levels of plasma Phe, below 500 μM over the entire week. 
Weekly SC administration of pegvaliase at 80 mg/kg (approximately 4 IU/mouse) for 16 weeks reduced 
plasma Phe concentration from approximately 2000 μM/L to < 200 μM/L (Study 165-07-001). A transient 
attenuated Phe-lowering response was seen between Weeks 3 and 7, likely attributed to the antibody 
response to pegvaliase. However, from Week 7 onward, plasma Phe concentrations again decreased 
post-dose for the duration of the study. Repeated administrations of pegvaliase did not elicit signs of 
anaphylaxis or local injection-site reactions. No toxicities related to the lowering of plasma Phe were 
evident in the treated mice. In addition to lowering plasma Phe, the health of treated mice improved as

Female ENU2 mice also have significant reproductive impairment as they are fertile but exhibit profound 
maternal PKU effects including impaired fetal outcome resulting in essentially 100% litter loss. Pups are 
born, but die within 24 hours of birth.  A partial correction of maternal PKU syndrome is possible by 
feeding a Phe-restricted diet to pregnant female PKU mice; pups survive but are gradually lost until only 
1 or 2 are alive at weaning. 
Female ENU2 mice were treated with 5 or 10 mg/kg pegvaliase 3 times per week for up to 27 weeks and 
then daily with 6 or 7 mg/kg (Studies 165-09-068 and 165-10-008) which resulted in decreased plasma 
Phe levels from ~2000 µM/L to ~300-600 µM/L. After animals were switched to daily dosing, litter 
survival was 43% (6 out of 14 litters) with 4.3 pups per litter. Females gave birth to live pups, but only 2 
out of 8 pregnancies successfully yielded live pups at weaning. These litters were also small compared to 
wild-type mice. Similar results were achieved in a subsequent study (0165-08-027) where Phe levels 
below 0.2 mM were reached.  
The effects of pegvaliase on neuropathological parameters were also investigated in ENU2 mice. Mice 
received pegvaliase 3 times per week up to 12 weeks and were compared to age matched wild-type 
controls (Study 165-14-044). Phenylalanine decreased after administration of pegvaliase and showed a 
typical transient increase due to pegvaliase antibodies until tolerance was reached. Administration of 
pegvaliase also resulted in an upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased TH positive neurons in 
the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and arcuate nucleus compared to ENU2 controls. While statistically 
significant, these changes were small compared to wild-type controls. No behavioural studies were 
conducted to assess whether the observed changes had functional effects.   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were submitted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The CNS effects of a single SC dose of 0, 10, 50, and 125 mg/kg pegvaliase administered to male and 
female rats were evaluated before dosing and at approximately 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-dose (Study 
165-07-004). Each animal underwent a modified Irwin neurological assessment including a battery of 
behavioural tests and clinical observations. A reduction in body weight gain was seen in the high dose 
(125 mg/kg) group compared to control animals by Day 6 after dose administration. No changes in CNS 
parameters were noted in the pegvaliase-treated rats for any portion of the modified Irwin assessment at 
SC doses up to 125 mg/kg. 
The respiratory effects of a single SC injection of 0, 10, 50, and 125 mg/kg pegvaliase were assessed in 
male rats (Study 165-07-005). Respiratory parameters included tidal volume, respiration rate, and 
minute volume. A single SC dose of up to 125 mg/kg of pegvaliase administered to male rats caused no 
alterations in respiratory function parameters evaluated in this study. 
The CV effects of a single SC injection of 0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg pegvaliase were evaluated in conscious 
telemetry-instrumented cynomolgus monkeys (Study 165-07-006). Cardiovascular effects assessed 
were electrocardiogram (ECG) and hemodynamic (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures), 
inotropic state, heart rate, and abdominal temperature. No direct effects on cardiac rhythm, QT interval, 
or corrected QT interval (QTc) were observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg pegvaliase. No physiologically 
important changes were observed in hemodynamic data, inotropic state, heart rate or abdominal 
temperature.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with pegvaliase were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Study 0165-07-028 was a single 20 mg/kg SC dose PK/PD study of pegvaliase in homozygote (-/-) male 
ENU2 mice. A Cmax of 209 μg/mL in plasma was observed at 24 hours post-dose, after which plasma 
concentrations of pegvaliase steadily declined with a terminal t1/2 of 26.9 hours (Vz/F and CL/F were 
75.5 mL/kg and 1.95 mL/hr/kg, respectively). Plotting plasma pegvaliase against plasma Phe showed a 
PK-PD relationship of decreasing plasma Phe with increasing pegvaliase concentration. Plasma Phe levels 
reached the lowest levels at plasma pegvaliase concentrations ≥50 µg/mL. 
Two studies (0165-09-069 and 0165-09-070) evaluated PK and PD of a single 20 mg/kg SC pegvaliase 
dose in homozygote (-/-) ENU2 male and female mice respectively. Thirty-two male and 28 female 
animals were administered pegvaliase and were divided into 10 groups of 2-4 mice/group based on 
schedule for terminal post-dose blood sampling procedures. Mean (SD) pegvaliase and Phe 
concentrations versus time for male and female rats are presented in Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Mean (+SD) Pegvaliase and Phe Plasma Levels Following a Single 20 mg/kg SC Injection of 
Pegvaliase in Homozygote ENU2 Mice (Studies 0165-09-069 and 0165-09-070) 
For both genders, all antibody titers remained below the assay cut point (<50 TU) except one male and 
three females having low titers of 50 across the time points investigated (8, 192 and 240 hours 
post-dose). Due to the low incidence of immunogenicity, impact on exposure could not be assessed. 
Study 0165-07-003, was a single-dose PK of pegvaliase in male and female rats were determined with 
ascending single doses at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg IV and 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg SC. This study included a 
2-week recovery period.

Log-linear plasma plots from rats with IV injection showed terminal mono-exponential elimination and 
increased exposure with dose (data not shown). The SC plots showed similar characteristics as well as 
first-order absorption. PK parameters in this study are summarised in Table 2. 
Table 2. PK Parameters in Rats Receiving Single Doses in Study 0165-07-003 
AUC0-t and Cmax dose plots forced through zero were roughly linearly proportional for IV and SC dosing 
and slighlty less than proportional at the highest dose (data not shown). An overlay of male and female 
plasma profiles qualitatively indicated no PK difference with gender. 
Study 0165-07-007, was a single-dose PK study of pegvaliase in the monkey evaluating 3 doses, 4, 12, 
and 60 mg/kg, administered by SC injection. The log-linear plots showed increased exposure with dose 
and mono-exponential terminal elimination (data not shown). PK results from this study are summarised 
in Table 3.

An overlay of male and female plasma profiles qualitatively indicate no PK difference with gender. 
Regression of mean AUC0-t and Cmax values with the 4 and 12 mg/kg SC doses forced through zero

In study 0165-08-006 pegvaliase was administered SC once-daily, at 2 mg/kg/day from Days 1-14 and at 
4 mg/kg/day from Days 15-36 with a 14 day recovery phase to investigate PK/PD effects in homozygote 
(-/-) male BTBRPahenu2 (ENU2) mice. Pegvaliase and Phe plasma concentrations over the course of 
Study 0165-08-006 are presented in Figure 4.

Injections of Pegvaliase to Homozygote Male ENU2 Mice for 36 Days (study 0165-08-006) 
In Study 0165-07-009, Crl:CD(SD) rats, received SC injections of pegvaliase twice a week for 4 weeks, 
followed by a 2-week recovery period.  
After the first dose, plasma exposure of pegvaliase in the rat increased with ascending doses. In Week 2 
(Dose 4) plasma levels dropped below Week 1 for all 3 doses; in Week 4 (Dose 7) levels increased 
compared to Week 2 and for the high dose, levels returned to about the initial levels of Week 1. The 
change of pegvaliase plasma levels in Week 4 appears more pronounced with female rats than male (data 
not shown). PK parameters from this study are summarised in Table 4.

All samples from all animals were negative for neutralizing antibodies to rAvPAL in rat serum through Day 
272 of the dosing phase except for one male and one female given 1 mg/kg/dose. In both animals, 
neutralizing antibodies were only found on Day 120 of the dosing phase. 
In Study 0165-07-008, Cynomolgus monkeys were dosed between 0.01 and 1 mg/kg over 4 weeks 
followed by a 4-week recovery period. As observed with single SC dosing, exposure pegvaliase increased 
with increasing doses in week 1 (Dose 1). For the second week, plasma levels increased giving an 
accumulation index of about 3.7 (1.1 to 14.4); time to steady state could not be determined from 
available data. These trends appeared to be similar for male and female monkeys. PK parameters from 
this study are summarised in Table 6.

Study Number 0165-07-030 was a repeat-dose toxicity and TK study of pegvaliase in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Plasma pegvaliase samples were collected through Week 39, with intensive PK collections 
taken from pre-dose to 72 hours post-dose following the first dose on Day 1 (Week 1) and last dose on 
Day 267 (Week 39). Summary statistics of PK parameters of pegvaliase after the first and last weeks of 
dosing are presented in Table 7.

Table 7. Summary of PK Parameters for Study No. 0165-07-030 
All control animals and animals given 0.01 mg/kg/dose remained negative for neutralizing antibodies. All 
other animals, with the exception of one female given 0.1 mg/kg/dose and one female given 7.0 
mg/kg/dose (unscheduled early sacrifice), became positive for neutralizing antibodies, however, a 
correlation between the anti-pegvaliase IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to pegvaliase was 
uncertain due to the relatively small number of subjects with positive neutralizing antibodies. 
Metabolism and Excretion 
No metabolism or excretion studies with pegvaliase were submitted. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with pegvaliase were submitted.  
Immunogenicity 
In all repeat-dose toxicity studies and some of the developmental toxicity studies, the presence of 
anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was monitored.  
In the 4-week study in rats and the 4- and 39-week study in monkeys, anti-rAvPAL-PEG IgG was 
monitored. Overall, an IgG response was noted in all dose groups, starting at 2-3 weeks of the study. In 
rats, approximately 50% of the animals showed anti-rAvPAL-PEG IgG antibodies at the end of the dosing 
period; in monkeys, all animals became positive in the 39-week study, as well as all high dose and some 
low/mid dose animals in the 4-week study. 
In the 26-week study in rats, the fertility and developmental study in rats and the dose range finding 
developmental study in rabbits, anti-rAvPAL IgG was monitored. These antibodies were first observed 2 
weeks after dosing. In the 26-week study in rats, 50-78% of the rats were positive for anti-rAvPAL IgG at 
the end of the dosing period (more animals at lowest dose). However, in the fertility study in rats, only 
36% of the low dose females and 16-52% of the males became positive. Also in the rabbit developmental 
(range finding) study, only 20% of the animals (low and mid dose) showed an antibody response. It is 
noted that plasma drug levels for animals at the end of the study were (at least in several animals) 
greater than assay drug tolerance (2 μg/mL). 
rAvPAL-IgM was monitored in the 4-week studies in rats and the 4- and 39-week studies in monkeys. 
rAvPAL-IgM was observed in none of the monkeys and two of the rats in the 4-week study and in several 
of the monkeys at the end of the 39-week study (including some of the control females).

Neutralizing ADA’s, diminishing the activity of pegvaliase were observed in two rats of the 26-week 
repeated dose study (and one male in the 17-week interim analysis) and in 40/48 monkeys of the 39 
week repeated dose study (none in the lowest dose group).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pegvaliase is a PEGylated protein product, prepared using recombinant DNA technology comprised of 
naturally occurring amino acids that is administered for the treatment of adult patients only with PKU. The 
applicant considered that pegvaliase does not present any risk for the environment following its 
prescribed use in patients.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The ability of pegvaliase to cleave phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid (TCA) and ammonia was 
determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 290nM as an indicator of the presence of TCA 
demonstrating that pegvaliase is able to convert phenylalanine to the specified constituent parts.  
A number of in vivo studies were conducted with pegvaliase in BTBRPahenu2 (ENU2), a homozygous 
mutant at the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) locus. This mouse model exhibits similar clinical 
characteristics of PKU patients including hyperphenylalanemia, hypopigmentation and cognitive deficits. 
Overall, the in vivo studies demonstrate that in ENU2 mice, pegvaliase is able to dose dependently reduce 
phenylalanine, improves neurological effects, increases the weight and restores coat colour.  In female 
mice, improvements on neonatal survival were achieved although the relevance for this observation in 
humans is limited. Despite the profoundly reduced phenylalanine levels, the changes in phenotype of 
ENU2 mice were modest. 
Administration of a single dose pegvaliase up to 125 mg/kg in rats did not result in any neurological 
changes. A reduction in body weight was observed in the high dose group by day 6 without noticeable 
changes in CNS parameters. There were no effects on tidal volume, respiration rate, and minute volume.  
There were no effects on cardiac rhythm, QT interval, or corrected QT interval (QTc), hemodynamic data, 
inotropic state, heart rate or abdominal temperature after a single dose of pegvaliase up to 10 mg/kg in 
monkeys.  
Based on the pharmacology studies submitted by the applicant, pegvaliase appears to have a low 
potential to adversely affect the CNS, respiratory system or cardiovascular system.

No secondary PD studies were submitted and this was considered acceptable, as pegvaliase is intended as 
an enzyme substitution therapy. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted, as based on the structure of the product 
(recombinant bacterial enzyme) it is not expected that pegvaliase would interact with drug metabolizing 
enzyme systems. 
Single dose pharmacokinetic with SC doses of 4, 12 and 60 mg/kg in the monkey and 10, 25 and 250 
mg/kg in the rat were performed. In the rat study, I.V. single doses (1, 5 and 25 mg/kg) were also 
included to determine bioavailability. In addition, single dose studies were performed in ENU2 mice. 
In general, the absorption of pegvaliase, following SC administration, was slow in rats and monkeys, with 
a Tmax of 18-96 and 52-105 hours, respectively. Pegvaliase showed a mono-exponential elimination. No 
gender differences were observed in these species. The volume of distribution (Vz/F) was  449-532 mL/kg 
in rat and 45.6-76.3 in monkey, compared to 317-370 mL/kg in humans (22.2-26.4L). Plasma clearance 
was 7.1-10.5 mL/hr/kg in rat, but much lower in monkeys (0.46-0.82 mL/hr/kg). Data in monkeys (T1/2, 
Vz and CL) are based on 1 animal in the low dose and 1 animal in the mid dose. Systemic exposure of 
pegvaliase increased in a roughly linear dose proportional manner at the lower dose levels, but appears 
to be less than proportional at the highest dose level in both rat and monkey. Terminal elimination (T1/2) 
following SC injection was slow (33-47 hours in rats and 64-71 hours in monkeys) and independent of 
increasing dose. 
The mean SC bioavailability of pegvaliase in rats was 7.8-16.9%, when compared to the 1 mg/kg IV dose 
and decreased with increasing SC dose levels. It is noted that when the SC doses are compared to the 25 
mg/kg I.V. dose, bioavailability ranged between 12-35%.  
Studies in ENU2 mice (using Phase 2 Process A material) showed gender differences: AUC and Cmax were 
approximately 3.1- and 3.5-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males, whereas the 
apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) and systemic clearance (CL/F) for pegvaliase in males were 
approximately 2.2- and 3.1-fold higher than females. In addition, exposure (AUC, Cmax) using Phase 1 
pegvaliase material in males was approximately 3-4 fold higher than the Phase 2 Process A material. 
No metabolism studies with pegvaliase were conducted in animals. The metabolism of phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase is expected to occur via catabolic pathways and to be degraded into small peptides and 
amino acids.  
Due to the nature and molecular size of pegvaliase, no renal or hepatic excretion is anticipated. Therefore, 
no specific studies to measure excretion of pegvaliase were conducted. The absence of metabolism and 
excretion studies is in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
PK drug-drug interactions at are highly unlikely for pegvaliase as biotechnology-derived substances are 
not metabolized via CYP P450 enzymes. The absence of such studies was therefore considered 
acceptable. 
Single and repeat dose toxicity studies of SC administered pegvaliase were conducted in rats and 
monkeys and included a 2-3 week recovery period. Lethal doses in monkeys occured between 12 and 60 
mg/kg, whereas no drug-related lethality was observed in rats given up to 250 mg/kg pegvaliase. 
Multiple toxico-kinetic studies were performed in rats (4 and 26 weeks; dose levels 1-25 mg/kg) and 
Cynomolgus monkeys (4 and 39 weeks; dose levels 0.01-7/5/3 mg/kg) upon twice weekly SC 
administration as well as in Enu2 mice (36 days, daily SC administration of doses of 2/4 mg/kg). 
In female rats vacuolation of the spleen was observed at the 8 or 25 mg/kg pegvaliase dose, but only in 
the high dose in males. This finding was still observed in the recovery group. In the 26 week study, 
histiocytic vacuolation of the spleen, liver, kidney tubules, mesenteric lymph node and mandibular lymph 
node was observed in in females from 8 mg/kg biw upwards and in males from 25 mg/kg. Vacuolation of

the adrenal cortex was observed in both males and females given 25 mg/kg pegvaliase. Vacuolation of 
the testes was observed in males given 25 mg/kg pegvaliase. In the recovery group, minimal vacuolation 
of histiocytic cells persisted in these organs, but at a lower incidence and severity, suggesting partial 
reversibility.  
Vacuolation is likely an adaptive response to clearance of PEG, especially in the kidney, which is the target 
organ for the clearance of low molecular weight (<20kDa) PEG and was also associated with increased 
renal tubular hypertrophy. No vacuolation was observed in the brain or choroid plexus (CP) of rats and no 
vacuolation was observed in the monkey in any tissue. The applicant considered that tissue vacuolation 
reflects tissue distribution of PEG. However, no separate group of animals was treated with PEG alone in 
order to make meaningful comparisons of potential PEG-related effects. The vacuolation observed in 
these studies was not associated with any organ related toxicities as determined by clinical 
chemistry/urinalysis and histopathological analysis. 
In the repeat dose studies plasma rAvPAL-PEG values increased after the first doses, with a transient drop 
after 2-4 weeks. This drop coincides with the peak in anti-PEG IgM/IgG and anti-PAL IgM antibody 
responses, circulating immune complex (CIC) levels and complement activation and may be explained by 
a combination of rapid clearance mediated by the early anti-PEG antibody response and relatively high 
levels of IgM (both forming immune complexes and activating complement), and not by anti-PAL IgG 
antibodies, which are less likely to activate complement.  
This is supported by the non-clinical immunogenicity data. In most of the studies, only anti-PAL 
antibodies were measured. However, In the 4 week study in monkeys, however, anti-PEG IgG was 
measured. At day 28, anti-PEG IgG was detected in 5/6, 3/6 and 2/6 animals of the 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg 
dose, respectively. A dose-dependent decrease in pegvaliase levels was observed around day 22 in all 
dose groups.   
In cynomolgus monkeys, the incidence and severity of arterial inflammation was dose dependant and 
observed in a wide range of organs and tissues at clinically relevant exposures in the 4-a dn39-week 
repeat-dose toxicology studies. The arterial inflammation observed in these studies involved small 
arteries and arterioles in a wide range of organs and tissues and in subcutaneous injections sites. Arteritis 
was attributed to the immune-mediated response with chronic administration of foreign proteins to the 
animals. The vascular inflammation observed in these studies was reversible upon cessation of 
treatment. 
Dose-dependent reductions in body weight gain attributed to decreased plasma phenylalanine levels to 
below normal levels in normal animals (monkeys, rats and rabbits) was observed in single and repeat 
dose toxicology studies as well as developmental and reproductive toxicity studies with pegvaliase. 
Decreased plasma phenylalanine and reduced body weight gain was reversible after cessation of 
treatment. 
Adverse reproductive and developmental effects of pegvaliase in rats and rabbits were dose dependent 
and included reduced implantation rate, smaller litter size, lower foetal weights, and increased foetal 
alterations. Additional findings in rabbits included increased abortions, foetal malformations and 
embryo/foetal lethality. These findings occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body 
weights, decreased ovarian weights, and decreased food consumption) and were associated with 
markedly decreased maternal blood phenylalanine below normal levels in non-PKU animals. The 
contribution of maternal phenylalanine depletion to the incidence of embryo-foetal developmental effects 
was not evaluated. 
In the peri/postnatal study, pegvaliase decreased pup weight, litter size, and survival of offspring during 
lactation, and delayed sexual maturation of offspring when administered daily in rats at 20 mg/kg 
subcutaneously. The effects in offspring were associated with maternal toxicity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 36/110 
 
 
 
Foetal toxicity is included in the Risk Management Plan as an important potential risk and will be further 
characterised by a Peri-/postnatal development study in rats and a foetal development study in rabbits. 
Uncontrolled blood phenylalanine levels (hyperphenylalaninaemia) before and during pregnancy are 
associated with increased risk for miscarriage, major birth defects (including microcephaly and major 
cardiac malformations), intrauterine foetal growth retardation and future intellectual disability with low 
IQ.  
In case of hypophenylalaninaemia during pregnancy, there is a risk of intrauterine foetal growth 
retardation. Additional risk to the unborn child due to hypophenylalaninaemia is not established. 
Maternal blood phenylalanine levels must be strictly controlled between 120 and 360 µmol/l  both before 
and during pregnancy. Palynziq is not recommended during pregnancy, unless the clinical condition of the 
woman requires treatment with pegvaliase and alternative strategies to control phenylalanine levels have 
been exhausted. 
Available toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of pegvaliase in milk. It is unknown whether 
pegvaliase is excreted in human milk. In the pups of these animals, systemic exposure of pegvaliase was 
not detected. A risk to infants cannot be excluded. Due to lack of human data, pegvaliase should only be 
administered to breast-feeding women if the potential benefit is considered to outweigh the potential risk 
to the infant. 
Pegvaliase is a recombinant protein and no genotoxicity is expected from these types of products. The 
CHMP considered that the absence of genotoxicity studies was acceptable. 
No carcinogenicity studies with pegvaliase were submitted, as it is not expected to bind to DNA. The 
applicant also performed a literature search which did not reveal any evidence of carcinogenicity for PAL, 
rAvPAL or PEG. The absence of carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter its concentration or distribution 
in the environment. Therefore, pegvaliase is not expected to pose a risk to the environment and the lack 
of a detailed environmental risk assessment was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of pegvalaise have been 
adequately characterised from a non-clinical perspective. A peri-/postnatal development study in rats and 
a foetal development study in rabbits is expected to provide information on maternal phenylalanine 
depletion in the incidence of embryo-foetal developmental effects.

Bioavailability 
Single dose PK of pegvaliase was studied in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in study PAL-001 (Phase 
I). Subjects (n=5 per cohort) were administered 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg doses, 
respectively. Subjects were to receive a single dose (i.e. no intra-subject repeated dosing or dose 
escalation) as a subcutaneous (SC) injection and then were to be followed for a total of 43 days (6 weeks) 
with visits to the clinical research unit. No exposure was observed at the 0.001 and 0.003 mg/kg dose. 
The mean Tmax values at the three doses 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg were 89, 106 and 101 hrs; the mean 
half-lives are at 59.5, 45.8 and 120 hr, respectively. The mean concentration-time curves for dose 0.01, 
0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg are presented in Figure 5.

Bioequivalence has been investigated between drug with Process A and B (study PAL-002) which showed 
comparability in PK of pegvaliase between them. As process B contained increased PEG, this result 
indicated that increased number of PEG does not improve the exposure of pegvaliase. Processes C and D 
contained the same number of PEG as Process A but with two different presentations of pegvaliase, i.e. 
vial/syringe (VS) and pre-filled syringe (PFS, the final commercial product).

Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of pegvaliase has been estimated in PKU patients in study 
165-302 (Part 3 PK data) with the doses of 20 mg and 40 mg daily. Mean apparent volume of distribution 
(SD) of pegvaliase were calculated based on limited patients who were treated with PFS (excluding the 
subject who switched from placebo to treatment arm), and were found to be 26.4 L (±64.8 L) (n = 12 
patients) for 20 mg/day and 22.2 L (±19.7L) (n=5) for 40 mg/day.  
Elimination 
Because of early immune response, pegvaliase is primarily cleared by immune-mediated mechanisms. In 
study 165-302 Part 3 (Week 62), clearance of pegvaliase (PFS) stabilized and was eliminated with a mean 
(SD) half- life of 47.3 hours (41.6 hours) and 60.2 hours (44.6 hours) at 20 mg and 40 mg respectively. 
Individual values for half-life ranged from 14 to 132 hours.  
In study 165-302, the apparent clearance was also different between the dose level of 20 mg and 40 mg 
daily for both VS and PFS after Week 57. With PFS in Week 62, the CL ss/F with 20 mg daily was 0.39 L/h, 
whereas with 40 mg daily the CL ss/F was 1.25 L/h.     
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Based on study 165-301, the pegvaliase Ctrough concentrations over the dose range of 20 and 40 
mg/day showed a more than dose proportional increase (Figure 7). 
Figure 6. Mean trough Pegvaliase concentration over time by randomised dose group (Study 165-301) 
However, in study 165-302, the exposure between at the 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day dose is much less 
than dose proportional for parts 1 and 2(Figure 7 part 1, part 2 not shown).

Time dependency 
The dosing paradigm in phase III was changed to an Induction/Titration (I/T) regimen based on 
tolerability in the phase 2 studies. In Induction/Titration (I/T) regimen, apparent clearance of pegvaliase 
was increased in many subjects and plasma exposure was low to non-detectable after Week 1-2 due to

the early immune response. Later after the antibodies level stable, the concentration increased. In phase 
3 studies at in the maintenance phase steady state was observed between 4 – 24 weeks.  
• 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
All the clinical studies were conducted in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. Different regimens have been 
used in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. The dose regimens proposed in the SmPC are used in Phase III 
studies, so only results from those studies are presented in this report. 
Patients started with a starting regimen (weekly dose), then titration regimen in study 301, followed up 
in study 302 in which all patients entered maintenance regimen treated with daily dose of pegvaliase. 
With the 2.5 mg weekly starting dose regimen, the pegvaliase plasma concentration was very low or 
below the LLOQ after Week 1-2. PK parameters of pegvaliase were only calculated based on the PK 
samples from Week 1 (VS) or Week 5/6 (PFS) in Part 3 of study 302 Table 13, concentration time curves 
for PFS in Figure 7), which is around 60-70 weeks after the starting regimen (study 165-301)

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pegvaliase is a pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme that converts phenylalanine to ammonia 
and trans-cinnamic acid that are metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine, respectively. 
Pegvaliase reduces blood phenylalanine levels and as such substitutes for the deficient PAH enzyme. 
Contrary to PAH which acts intracellularly and is modulated by cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
pegvaliase acts in the blood compartment independently from BH4.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Reduction of blood phenylalanine levels was either chosen as primary (part 2 of study 165-302) or 
secondary endpoint in clinical studies of this dossier. Data on the reduction of blood phenylalanine levels 
are discussed in the clinical efficacy paragraph of this report. 
No secondary pharmacology studies were submitted, as off-targets of pegvaliase are not expected. 
Immunogenicity 
Pegvaliase immunogenicity was monitored using a panel of semi-quantitative immunoassays to detect 
antibodies directed against the total drug (TAb) and specific isotypes against each component of the drug 
(PAL IgM, PAL IgG, PEG IgM, and PEG IgG). NAb capable of inhibiting enzymatic activity of the PAL 
enzyme were also measured. IgE antibodies specific to PEG-PAL or PAL alone were monitored using 
assays yielding a positive or negative result. Blood samples for routine immunogenicity testing were 
collected prior to dosing. 
Antibody titre over time is presented for study 165-301 below (Figure 9).

RDT: Randomised withdrawal. The RDT Population was defined as all subjects in the mITT Population who 
were originally enrolled in 165-301, were randomized into Part 2, and entered Part 4; The Non-RDT 
Population was defined as all subjects who entered Part 4, were originally enrolled in 165-301, and did not 
participate in Part 2 because they did not have ≥20% blood phenylalanine reduction. The Non-RDT 
Population was a subset of the population of subjects who did not participate in Part 2 who did not have 
blood phenylalanine reduction of ≥ 20% from naïve baseline prior to entering Part 4.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
During the clinical development program, pegvaliase from four different processes was used (A-D), in 
which bioequivalence has been shown between processes A and the higher PEG containing process B, 
indicating that increasing the number of PEG does not improve the exposure of pegvaliase. Pegvaliase 
from process C and D contain the same number of PEG as from Process A.  Only pegvaliase from process 
D was used in Phase III studies, and will be used for commercial formulation as PFS. 
There was high inter-individual variability with the PFS form of the product. Different injection sites or the 
number of injections had no impact on the PK. Although the variation in Ctrough level cannot be explained, 
considering the close monitoring for phenylalanine level in patients in practice, and that the dose will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 46/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjusted based on response, the variation in Ctrough from the clinical trials is not considered clinically 
relevant. 
The absolute bioavailability of pegvaliase with subcutaneous injection in humans remains unknown.  
However, this is acceptable as overall the pharmacokinetics appear to be highly individualised and 
dependent on the individual’s immune response.  
Following a single dose subcutaneous injection, pegvaliase is slowly absorbed and reaches maximum 
concentration in plasma around 4-5 days after administration. With the 2.5 mg weekly starting dose 
regimen, the pegvaliase plasma concentration was very low or below the LLOQ after Week 1-2. This is 
because immune-mediated clearance starts early (including baseline antibodies) and plays a major role in 
the elimination of pegvaliase. Because the total antidrug antibody level (ADA) reaches a maximum 
around Week 4 (study 165-301) and then becomes stable in Week 4-12, the pegvaliase plasma 
concentration increases after Week 3-4. Then the concentration continued to increase in the titration dose 
regimen along with the increase of the dosage.  
In the maintenance regimen, a daily dose of 20, 40 or 60 mg was given and, because of the slow 
absorption and frequent daily dose scheme, the steady state of pegvaliase Ctrough level can be reached in 
4-24 weeks in maintenance treatment in most of the patients.  
PK parameters (such as Vz/F, CL/F, t 1/2, Cmax and AUC24h) are calculated based on the pegvaliase 
concentrations with PFS from Part 3 of phase III study 165-302 (i.e. Week 62 after starting the 
treatment). Due to the study design (i.e. inclusion criterion of >20% Phe reduction, injection sites, and 
the number of injections), the PK data should be interpreted cautiously. Vz/F is 26.4 L (±64.8 L) (n=12 
patients) for the 20 mg/day and 22.2 L (±19.7L) (n=5) for the 40 mg/day dose. The CLss/F with 20 mg 
daily is 0.39 L/h, whereas with 40 mg daily the CL ss/F is 1.25 L/h. The mean (SD) half-life is 47.3 hours 
(41.6 hours) and 60.2 hours (44.6 hours) at the 20 mg and 40 mg daily dose, respectively. It should be 
noted that in part 3 of study 165-302, pegvaliase Ctrough levels between 20 mg and 40 mg daily dose with 
PFS are comparable. This was due to the inclusion criterion (i.e. >20% reduction of phenylalanine) 
applied in part 2 of the study, so only the patients who have relatively high Ctrough were included in further 
treatment. Furthermore, patients were not randomised, and the dose was chosen based on the response 
of patients.   
Because of immune-mediated clearance, the inter-individual variability in pegvaliase exposure was high 
(142 – 301%).  
No patients with renal or hepatic impairment were included in the clinical studies. This was considered 
acceptable, because proteins are primarily cleared by catabolism and therefore no direct effect of 
hepatic/renal function on the pharmacokinetics of pegvaliase is expected. Nevertheless, the impact of the 
elimination of PEG, trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia (substrate after catabolism of phenylalanine) in 
renal/hepatic impaired patients has been included in the RMP as missing information.  
Anti-drug- antibodies (ADA) were detected in all patients treated with pegvaliase and independently from 
the dose levels. Patients with positive baseline of neutralising antibodies (NAb) had a higher incidence of 
not achieving the 120 – 600 μmol/L phenylalanine in the studies. However, as in practice the dose will be 
adjusted based on the individual phenylalanine level rather than the fixed dose in the studies, clinical 
consequences due to positive baseline NAb are not expected. In addition, considering the hypersensitivity 
issue in the patients, it is recommended that the applicant develops an assay to measure anti-PEG IgE 
and submit the final study report. Furthermore, anti-PEG antibody titers were high during induction and 
titration phase but decreased to low titers in maintenance phase. Therefore, anti-PEG antibodies may 
have interfered with PK measurements during the induction and titration phases. As pegvaliase dosing 
was determined on patient tolerability and blood phenylalanine reduction, this had no clinical impact.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 47/110 
 
 
 
Overall, in all clinical studies an inverse relationship between ADA response and pegvaliase plasma 
exposure was observed suggesting that subjects who mount a stronger immune response to pegvaliase 
are likely to have a lower pegvaliase plasma exposure. The inverse relationship between antibody titers 
and pegvaliase trough concentrations appeared to be present for all isotopes of anti-drug antibodies. 
In Part 1 of study 165-302, while patients were still on doses of 20 or 40 mg/day pegvaliase, patients with 
lower mean antibody titres achieved the largest reductions in blood phenylalanine concentration. In Part 
4, mean blood phenylalanine concentrations continued to decrease for all patients including those in the 
higher antibody titre quartiles (Q3 and Q4). This at least is reassuring in so far that patients with high 
neutralising antibodies still show efficacy in terms of phenylalanine reduction, and that dose increases do 
not induce an increase in antibody titres. It is however uncertain what the impact of high NAb titers is in 
patients on long term pegvaliase treatment. Immunogenicity data on long term pegvaliase treatment 
from study PAL-003 and 165-302 part 4 is expected in the final study reports. Immunogenicity and 
antibody response are addressed with appropriate warnings in the SmPC.  
A clear PD effect of pegvaliase was demonstrated in the pivotal part 2 of study 165-302 
(placebo-controlled withdrawal phase). The PD effect was further supported by data in the long-term 
studies PAL-003 and 165-302 part 4.  
Because antibody-mediated clearance is the primary mechanism by which the drug is cleared from 
plasma, patients with higher antibody titres required higher doses of pegvaliase to reach sustained blood 
phenylalanine reduction. As doses were optimized (adjusted for blood phenylalanine reduction and 
safety) in Part 4 of study 165-302, mean blood phenylalanine concentrations continued to decrease in all 
Part 4 analysis populations (Part 4 Safety Population, RDT Population, and Non-RDT Population) despite 
sustained anti-drug antibody titres.  
Given the observation that patients in the non-RDT population did not show a decrease in phenylalanine 
levels in the titration phase after desensitisation may be explained by the higher observed antibody titres 
in these patients (Figure 12). Nevertheless, in part 4 of study 165-302, meaningful phenylalanine 
reductions were also noted in the non-RDT patients after a dose increase.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The available pharmacokinetic data even though limited are considered sufficient, given that response to 
treatment is highly individualised and the product is titrated based on response.   
A sustained pharmacodynamic effect of pegvaliase in reducing baseline phenylalanine in PKU patients has 
been demonstrated. It is recommended that the applicant develops a new format for measurement of 
anti-PEG IgE in human serum using electrochemiluminescence to further characterise the role of antiPEG 
antibodies in hypersensitivity reactions to pegvaliase treatment. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication is supported by data from seven clinical studies: a single-dose Phase 1 study 
(PAL-001); 3 multi-dose Phase 2 studies (PAL-002, PAL-004, and 165-205) that were followed by the 
Phase 2 long-term open-label extension study (PAL 003); and two Phase 3 studies (165-301 and 
165-302), and the 165-302 sub-study (165-303).

Figure 11. Patient Disposition across the Phase II/Phase III with pegvaliase
The I/T/M Population (N=285) included 24 patients from 165-205 (including those who transitioned to PAL-003 and 
165-302) + 261 patients from 165-301 (including those who transitioned to 165-302). 
a 165-205: 1 patient completed the study and 2 stopped treatment early due to an AE; 21 patients transferred to 
another study, 20 to PAL-003 and 1 to 165-302 (N=24). 
b PAL-003: 37 patients are ongoing in the study and 20 discontinued from the study; 11 patients transitioned to 
165-302 (N=68). 
c 165-301: 4 patients completed the study without entering into 165-302, 48 patients discontinued from the study and 
a further 6 discontinued from study drug; 203 transitioned to 165-302 (N=261). 
d 3 Patients started pegvaliase in PAL-002, enrolled into PAL-003 and transferred to 165-302 extension; 5 Patients 
started pegvaliase in PAL-004, enrolled into PAL-003 and transferred to165-302 extension.; 3 Patients started 
pegvaliase in 165-205, enrolled into PAL-003 and transferred to 165-302 extension. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study PAL-002 was a 16 weeks open-label, dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
tolerability of multiple subcutaneous doses of rAvPAL-PEG in patients with PKU. The study consisted of 
two parts. In part 1, patients received a fixed pegvaliase dose for 8 weeks (0.001 mg/kg/week to 0.1 
mg/kg/week). In part 2, the 8 weeks induction period was followed by an additional 8 weeks of adjustable 
dosing (up to 5 mg/kg/week) to reach a blood phenylalanine levels of 60-600 μmol/L. Study PAL-002 
enrolled 40 patients of whom 11 patients were previously treated with pegvaliase in study PAL-001 (see 
pharmacokinetics section). 
Study PAL-002 did not demonstrate a clear pharmacological nor any clinical relevant effect on the 
phenylalanine reduction.  
Study PAL-004 was a phase II, 16 weeks, multi-centre, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of subcutaneous dose levels of pegvaliase administered daily in patients with 
PKU. Study PAL-004 included 16 PKU patients all receiving starting doses based on bodyweight. Patients 
received pegvaliase 0.06 mg/kg/day, 0.1 mg/kg/day, 0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.6 mg/kg/day, or 
0.8 mg/kg/day for 5 days per week for 13 weeks, followed by a 3 weeks safety assessment follow-up 
without pegvaliase dosing. The enrolment started with the 0.4 mg/kg/day dose and patients could be

titrated up or down depending on the tolerability and/or efficacy. The pharmaceutical product used in the 
study was vial+syringe (VS). 
The mean weekly dose was 0.486 mg/kg (range, 0.09 mg/kg to 1.14 mg/kg). At week 2 of the study a 
phenylalanine level ≤600 µmol/L was observed in all 16 patients, however this effect could not be 
sustained throughout the rest of the study. Only 4 patients had measurable drug concentrations across 
multiple study visits. Exposure decreased after week 2.  
Study 165-205 
Study 165-205 was a phase II, multi-centre, open-label, dose-finding study to evaluate safety, efficacy, 
and tolerability of subcutaneously administered pegvaliase in patients with PKU.  
This 25-week study included 24 weeks of pegvaliase administration followed by a 1 week of 
post-treatment safety follow-up. Twenty-four patients, naïve to pegvaliase treatment, were enrolled. The 
study was designed to find the optimal therapeutic dose, guided on phenylalanine levels (target is 
phenylalanine levels 60 to ≤600 µmol/L) and by safety/tolerability.  
Pegvaliase administration was initiated with an induction period, followed by a titration period and a 
maintenance period. Dosing was initiated as a fixed sub-therapeutic dose of 2.5 mg/week (induction 
period) to expose patients to the immunogenic properties of pegvaliase. Following the induction period, 
dose was titrated upwards (to a maximum weekly dose of 75 mg/day [375 mg/week]) towards the goal 
of reducing blood phenylalanine to a target of ≤600 µmol/L while minimizing the onset of hypersensitivity 
AEs. A therapeutic dose was reached once a blood phenylalanine reduction of ≤600 μmol/L was achieved 
and sustained for a minimum of 4 weeks (primary endpoint). The pharmaceutical product used in the 
study was the VS product. 
After a 4 weeks (mean 3.1 (±0.66) weeks) induction phase with 2.5 mg/week of pegvaliase, patients 
were titrated up to an effective target dose. Eleven of 24 (46%) patients achieved the target sustained 
phenylalanine levels ≤600 µmol/L for at least 4 weeks. Nine of these 11 patients maintained 
phenylalanine ≤600 µmol/L from week 12 to the end of the study week 24. For the patients who achieved 
the target dose, the average amount of weekly pegvaliase was 64.7 mg/week (SD, 45.52). For those 
patients who did not achieve target dose the average amount of pegvaliase was 89.4 mg/week (SD, 
74.88). By the end of the 24-week study drug administration period, median blood phenylalanine levels 
in the overall population were reduced to 644.0 μmol/L (median), a mean decrease of -551.2 μmol/L (SD, 
558.38) from baseline and -46.2 % change from baseline (SD, 42.77). 
At the end of study 165-205, 20 patients were transitioned to study PAL-003. One patient was 
transitioned to study 165-302. 
Study 165-301 
Study 165-301: a four-part, phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm, 
discontinuation study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injections of pegvaliase 
self-administered by adults with PKU. The study consisted of an induction, titration, and maintenance 
regimen.

a During Part 4, open-label pegvaliase may be administered at a dose of 5, 10, 20, 40, or 60 mg/day. 
Initially study 165-301 enrolled patients aged ≥16 to ≤70 years of age. As a safety precaution the 
protocol was amended (amendment 2; 18 August 2014) to only allow enrolment of patients ≥18 years to 
≤70 years old.  PKU patients with phenylalanine levels >600 μmol/L at baseline and phenylalanine levels 
>600 μmol/L for the 6 months prior to screening could be enrolled in the study. The paediatric patients 
aged 16 years to 18 years already enrolled could continue the treatment in the study and they could also 
participate in study 165-302. In total 261 patients were enrolled, 131 patients were randomised to a 
target dose of 20 mg/day and 130 patients to 40 mg/day.  
Of the 261 patients enrolled 196 (75.1%) patients were previously treated with sapropterin. Twenty-eight 
(28) patients were considered treatment naïve (10.7%). The majority (144/196; 73.5%) of the 
sapropterin treated patients were considered sapropterin non-responders. Fifty-two (52) of 196 patients 
were regarded as sapropterin responders. The treatment responses were not originally collected for 37 
patients as per the original protocol. However, using previous medication data 6 patients were identified 
as receiving sapropterin prior to starting 165-301. These 6 patients were considered sapropterin 
non-responders.  
All patients received a fixed starting dose of 2.5 mg/week pegvaliase for 4 weeks, i.e., the induction phase 
(to desensitise the patients to pegvaliase). After desensitisation patients were titrated toward the 
assigned randomised final study dose (20 or 40 mg/day). The induction and titration scheme were in line 
with the scheme used in phase II study 165-205 (see above).  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria, objectives and outcomes of the study were the same as in Study 165-302 
(see below). 
About 57% of the patients depended on MNT as a protein source. Baseline mean (SD) protein from intact 
food (gram; g) was 39.1 (27.3) in the 20 mg/day and 37.9 (28.3) in the 40 mg/day group.  
All 261 subjects enrolled in the study received at least one dose of pegvaliase and were included in the ITT 
and safety populations. 
The primary objective of study 165-301 was to characterize the safety and tolerability in pegvaliase-naïve 
patients who self-administered pegvaliase up to fixed maintenance dose levels of 20 mg/day or 40 
mg/day. The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate blood phenylalanine concentration during 
induction, titration, and maintenance. The pegvaliase dose (e.g. 2.5 mg/week) used in the induction 
phase is too low to expect an efficacy response. Therefore, the induction phase will not be further 
discussed with regard to efficacy.

Treatment with pegvaliase reduced mean blood phenylalanine concentration for both the 20 mg/day and 
the 40 mg/day randomized dose groups. The median reduction from baseline for all patients (ITT 
population) was -363.0 μmol/L at week 28 (n = 133) and -191.5 μmol/L at Week 36 (n = 80). There was 
a statistically significant difference (p-value=0.0269) between the randomized dose groups favouring the 
40 mg/day group. The least squares mean of the difference between the 20 mg/day group and 40 mg/day 
group was -112.8 μmol/L (95% confidence interval: -212.5, -13.1 μmol/L). A higher percentage of 
patients in the 40 mg/day randomized dose group compared to the 20 mg/day randomized dose group 
achieved blood phenylalanine reductions to ≤600 μmol/L (61/130 [46.9%] versus 45/131 [34.4%]). 
Median time to reach phenylalanine levels ≤600 μmol/L was 78.0 [14, 218] days for 20 mg/day and 78.0 
[15, 192] days in the 40 mg/day group. 
Of the 261 enrolled patients, 195 (75%) patients reached their randomised maintenance dosage (103 
patients in the 20 mg once daily arm, 92 patients in the 40 mg once daily arm). Patients in the 20 mg once 
daily randomised arm reached their maintenance dosage at a median time of 10 weeks (range: 9 to 29 
weeks) and patients in the 40 mg once daily arm reached their maintenance dosage at a median time of 
11 weeks (range: 10 to 33 weeks). Overall 66/261 patients (25.3%) did not reach the maintenance phase 
of the study. Twenty-four of the 66 patients did not reach the randomised dose due to early study closure 
(discussed below). The median time to reach the maintenance period was 10.1 weeks in the 20 mg/day 
randomized dose group (103 patients), 11.1 weeks in the 40 mg/day randomized dose group (92 
patients). It should be noted that the selection of patients who can reach the maintenance phase are the 
patients who can tolerate the drug.   
Of the 261 patients in Study 301, 11 patients were aged between 16 and 18 years at enrolment. All 11 
patients had inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels above 600 µmol/l) at 
baseline. These patients received the same induction/titration/maintenance regimen as patients aged 18 
years and older in this study. Mean (SD) change from baseline was 20 (323) µmol/l at Month 12 (n=9), 
460 (685) µmol/l at Month 24 (n=5), and 783 (406) µmol/l at Month 36 (n=5). Of the 11 patients initially 
enrolled in Study 301, 3 patients reached blood phenylalanine levels ≤ 600 µmol/l by 12 months, 7 
patients reached this threshold by 24 months, and 8 patients reached this threshold by 36 months. 
In the Phase 3 pegvaliase program, Study 165-301 served as a feeder study designed to select an 
appropriate subject population for evaluating the efficacy of pegvaliase in the placebo-controlled part of 
165-302. Once recruitment for 165-302, Part 2 was completed, 165-301 was closed early as the primary 
study objective of identifying subjects for the randomized discontinuation trial had been fulfilled.

Treatments 
Study drug (pegvaliase or matching placebo) was administered subcutaneously 7 days/week (i.e., daily) 
throughout the study. During Parts 1, 3, and 4, subjects were administered open-label pegvaliase. During 
Part 2, blinded pegvaliase (20 or 40 mg/day) or matching placebo was administered. Pegvaliase VS drug 
presentation was administered in Parts 1, 2, and 3. Pegvaliase PFS drug presentation was administered 
starting at Week 2 of Part 3 for subjects who participated in Week 1 of Part 2 or Part 4 for all other 
subjects.  
Objectives 
The primary and secondary efficacy objectives of this study were per data from assessments performed 
during Part 2. PK and PD objectives were per data from Part 3 of this study. Long-term assessments of 
efficacy were per data from naïve baseline from 165-301 (or the Phase 2 study in which pegvaliase was 
initiated) through Part 4 of this study (per the data cut-off date). 
PART 1: Open-Label Blood Phenylalanine Assessment 
The objectives of Part 1 were to screen subjects for eligibility for entry into Part 2 of the study and to 
characterize the safety of pegvaliase (20 or 40 mg/day) in subjects previously exposed to pegvaliase. 
There was no efficacy objective for Part 1.

PART 2: Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Discontinuation 
The primary efficacy objective of Part 2 was to evaluate blood phenylalanine concentration in subjects 
previously exposed to pegvaliase who were administered pegvaliase (20 or 40 mg/day) compared with 
those who were administered a matching placebo. The secondary efficacy objective of Part 2 was to 
evaluate inattention and mood symptoms in subjects previously exposed to pegvaliase who were 
administered pegvaliase (20 or 40 mg/day) compared with those who were administered a matching 
placebo. 
The safety objective of Part 2 was to evaluate the safety of pegvaliase in subjects previously exposed to 
pegvaliase who were administered pegvaliase (20 or 40 mg/day) compared with those who were 
administered a matching placebo. 
PART 3: Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Assessment 
The objectives of Part 3 were the following: 
• 
• 
To evaluate multiple-dose PK/PD in subjects who were administered pegvaliase 
To evaluate PK comparability between pegvaliase VS drug presentation and PFS drug 
presentation 
PART 4: Long-Term, Open-Label Extension 
The objectives of Part 4 of this study are the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the long-term effect of multiple dose levels of pegvaliase on blood phenylalanine 
concentration in subjects who are administered pegvaliase using PFS drug presentation 
To characterize long-term inattention, hyperactivity, and mood symptoms in subjects who are 
administered pegvaliase 
To evaluate long-term safety of multiple dose levels of pegvaliase in subjects who are 
administered pegvaliase using PFS drug presentation

POMS Subscale Scores 
In part 1 of the study efficacy was not studied. This part was only used to select patients eligible for part 
2, the randomised double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. 
Part 3 pertained to PK. 
Part 4 is the long term follow-up in which both phenylalanine and Neurocognitive and Neuropsychiatric 
Symptom Scores were collected. 
Sample size 
For Part 2, approximately 72 subjects (approximately 48 subjects for the active groups and 
approximately 24 subjects for the placebo groups) provided 97% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference in the primary endpoint between the pooled active group and the pooled placebo group at Week 
8 of Part 2 with a Type I error rate of 0.05 (2-sided). 
The following assumptions were made regarding blood Phe level by Week 8 of Part 2: 
•  By Week 8 of Part 2, subjects in the pooled active group maintained mean blood Phe 
concentrations ≤700 μmol/L with a common SD of 400 μmol/L 
•  By Week 8 of Part 2, subjects in the pooled placebo group increased mean blood Phe 
concentration to≥1100 μmol/L (after withdrawal from their pegvaliase dosing regimen) with 
a common SD of 400 μmol/L 
A total of 72 subjects provided approximately 70% power for the ADHD RS-IV Inattention Subscale score 
to detect the estimated difference between the active groups and the placebo groups in Part 2 using the 
sequential procedure for multiplicity adjustment within the secondary endpoints. The following 
assumptions were made: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
And 
There was a mean difference between the active group and the placebo group in the 
subset of subjects with a baseline ADHD RS-IV Inattention Subscale score >9 
(per baseline from 165-301) of 5 points with a SD of 5.5 points in the ADHD RS-IV 
(Investigator-Rated) Inattention Subscale score 
Fifty percent (50%) of the mITT Population had a baseline ADHD RS-IV Inattention 
•  Subscale score >9 (per baseline from the 165-301) 
Randomisation 
Upon entry into Part 1, subjects were administered open-label pegvaliase at a dose of either 20 mg/day 
or 40 mg/day, 7 days/week: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 56/110 
 
 
 
•  Subjects who completed 165-301 continued with the same pegvaliase dose to which they were 
randomized in 165-301 (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day). 
•  Subjects who completed PAL-003 or 165-205 were randomized (1:1) to receive 20 mg/day or 40 
mg/day pegvaliase (7 days per week). Subjects were randomized using an interactive web 
response system (IWRS). 
Eligible subjects for Part 2 of the Study were randomized (2:1) in a double-blind manner upon entry into 
Part 2 using an IWRS to continue with their Part 1 daily pegvaliase dose (20 or 40 mg/day) or receive a 
daily matching placebo: 
•  Subjects who received 20 mg/day in Part 1 were randomized (2:1) to 20 mg/day pegvaliase (20 
mg/day active group) or placebo (20 mg/day placebo group); 
•  Subjects who received 40 mg/day in Part 1 were randomized (2:1) to 40 mg/day pegvaliase (40 
mg/day active group) or placebo (40 mg/day placebo group). 
Randomization in Part 2 was stratified by mean blood phenylalanine measurement using the last two 
consecutive blood phenylalanine assessments in Part 1 (≤600 μmol/L or > 600 μmol/L) and ADHD RS-IV 
Inattention Subscale score, using the baseline from 165-301 (< 12 or > 12 or missing [or missing for 
subjects who initiated pegvaliase in a Phase 2 study]). The randomization schedule was developed by an 
independent third-party vendor (Section 4) to maintain the blinding of study drug assignment; BioMarin 
and site personnel were blinded to study drug assignment in Part 2. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Pegvaliase and placebo packaging were identical in appearance. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive summaries of continuous variables included number of subjects (n), the mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval ([95% CI] as appropriate) for 
the mean. Descriptive summaries of categorical variables included number of subjects (n), frequency, 
and percent. 
The baseline value for assessments in Part 2 was defined as the last available measurement prior to first 
administration of study drug in Part 2 unless otherwise specified. 
Data from 165-301 were integrated with data in this study for the long-term safety and efficacy analyses. 
Statistical tests were two-sided at the 0.05 significance level, and all CIs were two-sided 95% unless 
otherwise specified. For analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in Part 2, the Hochberg procedure was 
used for multiplicity adjustment. Between the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and within the 
secondary efficacy points in Part 2, the sequential hypothesis testing procedure was used for multiplicity 
adjustment. 
To explore the treatment effect of the 2 doses of pegvaliase, change from Baseline in blood phenylalanine 
concentration was analysed using a mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) model. 
If the poolability test result between the 40 mg/day and 20 mg/day placebo groups for the primary 
analysis method was not significant (P > 0.1), the change from baseline in blood phenylalanine 
concentration at Week 8 of Part 2 was compared between the pooled active group versus the pooled 
placebo group using the MMRM method, with study drug group (pegvaliase, placebo), visit, and study 
drug-by-visit interaction as factors adjusting for baseline blood phenylalanine concentration.

If the poolability test result was significant (P ≤ 0.1) between the 40 mg/day and 20 mg/day placebo 
groups for the primary analysis method, the change from baseline in blood phenylalanine concentration at 
Week 8 of Part 2 was compared between the pooled active group versus the 20 mg/day placebo group and 
between the pooled active group versus the 40 mg/day placebo group using the MMRM method with study 
drug group (pegvaliase, placebo), visit, and study drug-by-visit interaction as factors adjusting for 
baseline blood phenylalanine. 
An MMRM analysis was also performed for the population of subjects who entered the Maintenance Period 
and used at least 80% of their planned study medication during the Maintenance Period. Given the 
induction/titration/maintenance design of the study, an analysis population of subjects who reached their 
randomized dose level and demonstrated treatment compliance is better suited than the ITT population 
for assessing the actual treatment difference between the dose levels. 
An ANCOVA model was also used to compare the treatment effect from Baseline to end of study for 
subjects in the 2 randomized dose groups who completed the Maintenance Period. 
The primary analysis method for blood phenylalanine concentration was repeated in the mITT Population 
using the multiple imputation method and LOCF imputation as sensitivity analyses. Multiple imputation 
assumes that data are missing at random (MAR).

 Subjects were not included in the primary efficacy analysis (mITT Population) if they did not have a 
mean blood Phe reduction of ≥ 20% (using the last two consecutive blood Phe assessments of Part 1) 
from baseline levels per Amendment #2. Some subjects had already enrolled into Part 2 when this 
criterion for inclusion in the mITT was implemented with Amendment #2 of the protocol.

b
 Only subjects who were enrolled under Amendment #2 were considered for the PK/PD analyses; 58 of 
the 
89 subjects who entered Part 3 were enrolled under Amendment #2 and were included for the PK and PD 
analyses. 
c
 A total of 51 subjects entered Part 4 directly from 165-301 because they did not achieve target dose in 
165-301 (n = 33) or were affected by closure of enrolment into Part 2 (n = 18) after the target enrolment 
had been met. 
Another 57 subjects entered directly from Part 1 because they did not meet the blood Phe reduction 
criterion to qualify for entry into Part 2 (n = 39), due to closure of enrolment into Part 2 (n = 9), or for 
other reasons as instructed by the sponsor (n = 9). Five additional subjects entered Part 4 directly from 
Part 2 due to AEs. 
Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 29 July 2013 (first patient enrolled) 
Study completion date: 23 September 2016 (last dose given) 
Conduct of the study 
There were three main amendments to the original protocol.  
The protocol was amended (Amendment #1) on 10 January 2014. A total of 34 subjects enrolled into Part 
1 of the study under Amendment #1. Changes with this amendment did not affect part 2 of the study. 
The protocol was further amended (Amendment #2) on 8 August 2014; significant changes were made to 
the study design to better meet the study objectives and monitor subject safety. A total of 82 subjects 
enrolled into Part 1 and an additional 51 subjects enrolled directly in Part 4 of the study under amendment 
#2. The administrative changes introduced with this amendment were: 
•  Subjects from PAL-003 were only eligible for participation in the open-label extension (Part 4) of 
this study to receive pegvaliase at a dose of 10, 20, 40, or 60 mg/day, depending on the dose in 
which they completed PAL-003; 
• 
the statistical analyses were modified to align with the changes made to the study design. The 
primary analysis was to be based on an mITT Population, which was defined as the combined 
analyses of all subjects randomized in Part 2 of the study with a mean blood phenylalanine 
reduction of ≥ 20% (using the last two consecutive blood phenylalanine assessments of Part 1) 
from baseline levels of 165-301. 
An additional administrative letter was issued to sites (dated 28MAR2014) to temporarily suspend dosing 
of 60 mg/day pegvaliase following a request form the FDA. 
The protocol was finally amended (Amendment #3) on 15 December 2015. Enrolment into the study had 
closed at the time of Amendment #3. The main changes with this amendment were : 
o  The sample size for Part 2 (RDT) of the study was adjusted due to limited enrolment opportunity of 
subjects from the adult PKU patient population in the United States. 
o  The primary and secondary analyses were revised to align with the change in sample size for Part 2 
(RDT). Rather than performing separate comparisons for the 20 mg/day group and 40 mg/day group 
versus pooled placebo, pooling of subjects in the active groups (20 mg/day and 40 mg/day) versus 
pooled placebo was to be implemented.

phenylalanine level assessed at the time of screening for eligibility into this study; 
d 
The ADHD RS-IV Hyperacitivity/Impulsitivity Subscale and POMS tools were not performed in 165-301 until the first 
protocol amendment; only subjects who had baseline assessments were included. Possible scores for the ADHD RS-IV 
Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subscales range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicative of more severe 
symptoms. Possible scores for the POMS TMD range from -32 to 200, scores for the PKU POMS TMD range from -12 to 
58, and scores for the PKU POMS Confusion Subscale range from 0 to 11, with higher scores indicative of more severe 
symptoms. Neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric tools were not administered in the Phase 2 studies; 
e 
RDA for total protein for adults in the general population is 0.75 g/kg. For an 80-kg individual, approximately 60 g of 
daily protein is recommended; 
f Subjects were considered to be on restricted protein intake if > 75% of total daily protein intake was from medical 
food. Total daily protein intake was the sum of daily protein intake from medical food and daily protein intake from 
intact food.

Numbers analysed 
The following study populations were defined: 
Intent-to-Treat Population (Part 2): The ITT Population consisted of all subjects who were randomized 
into Part 2 of the study. 
Modified Intent-to-Treat Population (Part 2): The mITT Population consisted of all subjects who reached 
the randomized dose of 20 mg/day or 40 mg/day and were randomized into Part 2 with a mean blood 
phenylalanine reduction of ≥ 20% (using the last two consecutive blood phenylalanine assessments of 
Part 1) from the baseline of 165-301 (or the Phase 2 study in which they initiated pegvaliase). Primary 
analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints were performed based on the mITT Population. 
Per-Protocol Population (Part 2): The PP Population consisted of all subjects in the mITT Population who 
were compliant with the protocol with no major protocol violations that were considered to have affected 
efficacy analysis as detailed in the SAP. All efficacy analyses performed on the PP Population in Part 2 were 
based on the randomized study drug assignment.  
RDT and Non-RDT Population (Part 4): The long-term analysis was performed for all subjects who were in 
the 165-301 ITT Population and who entered into Part 4 of this study regardless of participation in Part 2 
of the study: 
- 
- 
The RDT Population was defined as all subjects in the mITT Population who were originally enrolled in 
165-301, were randomized into Part 2, and entered Part 4. 
The Non-RDT Population was defined as all subjects who entered Part 4, were originally enrolled in 
165-301, and did not participate in Part 2 because they did not have ≥20% blood phenylalanine 
reduction.  
o  Subjects who enrolled directly into Part 4 of this study from 165-301 were included in the 
Non-RDT Population if they did not have ≥20% blood phenylalanine reduction (using the last 
two consecutive blood phenylalanine assessments) from the naïve baseline of 165-301. 
Pharmacokinetic Population: The Part 3 PK Population consisted of all subjects with at least one PK 
measurement in Part 3 who were enrolled under Amendment #2. The Part 3 PK Population was analysed 
according to the study drug received (i.e. as treated). 
Population for Safety Analyses: The population for safety analyses consisted of all subjects who enrolled 
into the study and all subjects who enrolled into each study part for analysis by study part. As part of the 
eligibility criteria for this study, subjects were to have completed a previous pegvaliase study (165-301, 
PAL-003, or 165-205) where they would have received pegvaliase as an induction and titration regimen 
(165-301 and 165-205) or as an adjustable dose regimen (PAL-003). All safety analyses were performed 
overall and separately for each part (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 for PK/PD, and Part 4 for the long-term 
extension) of the study. 
For Part 2, the safety population consisted of all subjects who were randomized and received study drug 
in Part 2; safety was analysed according to the study drug assignment actually received (i.e., as treated). 
Outcomes and estimation 
To assess primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, testing for the poolability of the placebo groups (20 
mg/day and 40 mg/day) was performed and indicated a significant difference (P = 0.0424) at a 
pre-specified significance level of 0.1 between the 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day placebo doses for change 
from Part 2 baseline blood Phe concentration at Week 8 of Part 2 (data not shown).  
Changes in blood phenylalanine concentration are presented for the pooled active group versus the 20 
mg/day placebo group and the 40 mg/day placebo group (Table 16).

The mITT Population consisted of all subjects who reached the randomized dose of 20 mg/day or 40 mg/day and were 
randomized into Part 2 with a mean blood phenylalanine reduction of ≥ 20% (using the last two consecutive blood 
phenylalanine assessments of Part 1) from the baseline of 165-301 (or the Phase 2 study in which they initiated 
pegvaliase). 
Baseline blood phenylalanine concentration was defined as the last blood phenylalanine measurement collected in 
165-302 on or prior to dosing on Day 1 of Part 2. 
All Part 2 Week 8 (Day 56) assessments related to the primary endpoint were performed on or within one week prior 
to the target day, otherwise it was considered as a missing value for the analyses of the primary endpoint and the 
appropriated missing value imputation method(s) were applied.

The change in observed blood Phe for the mITT Population was plotted from naïve baseline through 
open-label dosing in 165-301 or a Phase 2 study and Part 2 of this study. Figure 15 shows the difference 
between the Part 2 dose groups, as well as the blood Phe concentrations for the placebo groups returning 
towards their naïve baseline blood Phe levels.

Change in Neurocognitive and Neuropsychiatric Symptom Scores from Part 2 Baseline to Week 8 of Part 
2 
The secondary objective of Part 2 of this study was to evaluate the change from baseline in neurocognitive 
and neuropsychiatric symptoms of inattention and mood during Part 2, as measured by the ADHD RS-IV 
Inattention Subscale and the POMS tools (Table 18) in subjects previously exposed to pegvaliase who 
self-administer pegvaliase (20 or 40 mg/day) compared with those who self-administer matching 
placebo.

Possible scores for the ADHD RS-IV Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Subscales range from 0 to 27, with 
higher scores indicative of more severe symptoms. 
Possible scores for the POMS TMD range from -32 to 200, scores for the PKU POMS TMD range from -12 to 58, and 
scores for the PKU POMS Confusion Subscale range from 0 to 11, with higher scores indicative of more severe 
symptoms. 
All Part 2 Week 8 (Day 56) assessments related to the secondary endpoints were performed one or within one week 
prior to the target day, otherwise they were considered missing values for the analyses of the secondary endpoints and 
the appropriated missing value imputation method(s) were applied. 
a
 Some subjects did not have Part 2 neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments data collected (Section 8.2. The 
ADHD RS-IV Inattention Subscale, PKU POMS, and POMS tools were not performed in 165-301 until a protocol 
amendment; only subjects who had baseline assessments were included. Subjects who were included in the mITT 
Population from a Phase 2 study were not included because neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric tools were not 
administered in the Phase 2 studies. 
b
 Negative values indicate a decline in symptom score (towards improvement); positive values indicate an increase in 
symptom score (towards decline). 
Protein intake 
Subjects were required to maintain a consistent level of protein intake during the study to ensure that 
changes in blood phenylalanine concentrations were attributable to the study drug rather than to changes 
in protein intake. Data were collected on subject-reported 3-day diet diaries and were assessed for its role 
in change in blood phenylalanine concentration relative to pegvaliase dosing during Part 2. 
At the start of Part 2, daily protein intake from intact food for subjects randomized to the pooled active 
group was a mean (SD) 49.0 g (23.84) and a median of 43.0 g versus respective 38.1 g (26.42) and 25.2 
g for subjects in the 20 mg/day placebo group and 39.4 g (22.69) and 36.1 g for subjects in the 40 
mg/day placebo group. Subjects in the pooled active group maintained their mean (SD) daily protein 
intake from intact food at Week 8 with a mean 3.9% increase from Part 2 baseline (mean total intake of 
47.1 g [24.06], median of 45.3 g).  
Long-term efficacy 
Analysis of the long-term efficacy of pegvaliase included experience from Part 4 of this study (the 
long-term, open-label extension phase). 
Blood Phe concentrations are summarized for all doses administered in Part 4 and displayed in Figure 16.

Figure 16. Mean Plot of Change from Baseline in Blood Phenylalanine Concentration During Part 4 (All 
Subjects, Study 165-302) 
The variability in sample size is attributed to the variability of subjects with available data at each time point (subjects 
who did not perform an assessment within the protocol-defined visit window, terminated from the study early, or have 
missing data were not included as of the cut-off for this Clinical Study Report). Subjects who did not have Week 1 data 
but had data for subsequent Part 4 time points were included. Part 4 results are based on data as of the data cut off for 
this CSR and are primarily discussed for subjects with data up through Week 41 of Part 4. These data and data at 
subsequent time points reflect a smaller and variable sample size due to the limited number of subjects with data at 
time points after Week 41 as of the data cut-off. 
After 41 weeks of long-term, open-label pegvaliase dosing in Part 4 where adjustable dosing in response 
to blood Phe or tolerability was allowed , the majority of subjects who were able to continue long-term 
dosing to this time point were able to achieve blood Phe milestones at various doses, as summarized in

Figure 17. Mean Plot of ADHD RS-IV Inattention Subscale Scores and Change from Baseline During Part 
4 (All Subjects) 
Prior to initiating pegvaliase, mean (SD) protein intake from intact food for all enrolled subjects was 38.4 
g (27.96 [n = 196]). Some increases were observed over the duration of Part 4 partially due to some 
subjects reaching low blood phenylalanine levels and increasing protein intake (within the protocol 
instructions). 
Ancillary analyses 
Additional analyses in support of prefilled syringe drug product presentation 
Results from PFS and VS comparability analyses performed in Part 3 of this study indicated that the 
exposure from pegvaliase per nominal dose delivered by PFS was 52% to 75% higher compared with 
pegvaliase delivered by VS based on the primary endpoints of AUC0-4hr,ss and Cmax,ss.  Because of this 
exposure difference observed between the two drug presentations, additional analyses were performed to 
assess the blood phenylalanine concentration, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and safety of subjects by PFS 
drug presentation (the intended to-be-marketed presentation) versus VS drug presentation. These 
additional analyses also included assessment of subjects who switched from PFS to VS pegvaliase at the 
start of 165-302 versus subjects who were exclusively administered VS into 165-302. Analyses were 
performed by 165-301 randomized dose group (20 and 40 mg/day) as well as all doses combined. 
As subjects transitioned from 165-301 to 165-302, all subjects who entered Part 1 of 165-302 were to be 
administered pegvaliase as VS regardless of the drug presentation administered in 165-301. 
Blood phenylalanine concentration and trough pegvaliase levels were assessed for subjects in the primary 
analysis population (ie, the mITT Population who initiated pegvaliase and received exclusively either PFS 
or VS in 165-301) by the 20 and 40 mg/day dose groups and pegvaliase drug presentations (PFS to VS 
and VS only) to evaluate whether blood phenylalanine levels and trough pegvaliase concentrations were 
stable upon entry into the randomized discontinuation portion of 165-302 (Part 2). The observed blood 
phenylalanine levels from naïve baseline in 165-301 through Part 1 of this study are also displayed by 20 
and 40 mg/day dose in Figure 18.

Panel B: 40 mg/day 
SE, standard error (of the mean) 
Analyses were performed for subjects who exclusively used one or the other drug presentation in 165-301. Part 2 Visits 
to the left of the vertical reference line are those that occurred in 165-301; Visits to the right of the vertical reference 
line are those that occurred in 165-302. 
Another population was defined to include the overall parent study 301 population (n=261, patients from 
parent study 301 who continued to 302), as psychological symptom efficacy endpoints (ADHD-RS IV, 
PKU-POMS and POMS scores), data on MNT status, and some immunogenicity data were collected for 
these patients but not for other subjects other subjects who started pegvaliase in a Phase 2 parent study 
(PAL-002, PAL-004, 165-205).  
188 out the 261 patients received treatment for at least 1 year, 4 patients completed treatment, and 69 
discontinued treatment in the first year. Of these 188 patients, 164 patients received treatment for at 
least 2 years, 2 patients continued treatment but had not yet reached 2 years of treatment, and 
22 patients discontinued in the second year, and 9 patients discontinued after 2 years of treatment. Of 
the 100 patients who discontinued treatment, 40 patients discontinued due to an adverse event, 
29 patients discontinued due to patient decision, 10 patients discontinued due to physician decision, and 
21 patients discontinued to other reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up, pregnancy, or protocol deviation). 
Efficacy results in this population are presented in Table 20.

1 Post-baseline phenylalanine values were mapped to the closest monthly visit (i.e. within a 1-month 
window). 
2 Reflects number of patients who reached time point (Month 12/Month 18/Month 24/Month 36) of 
treatment at the time of the data cut-off and had a scheduled phenylalanine assessment for that time 
point. 
3 Post-baseline ADHD-inattention/PKU-POMS confusion values were mapped to the closest 3-month visit 
(i.e. within a 3-month window). 
4 Change from baseline was based on subjects with available measurements at both time points. Not all 
subjects had a baseline ADHD inattention score and POMS confusion score taken at the start of the 
study. 
Phenylalanine levels over time 
Mean blood phenylalanine levels reduced from 1233 µmol/l at baseline to 565 µmol/l at Month 12 
(N=164) and 345 µmol/l at Month 24 (N=90), and these reductions in mean blood phenylalanine levels 
were maintained through Month 36 (341 µmol/l; N=48). Median change from baseline was -634 µmol/l 
at Month 12, -965 µmol/l at Month 24, and -913 µmol/l at Month 36 (Figure 19).

Changes in protein intake from intact food over time 
Median protein intake from intact food increased at Month 12 (4 g increase from baseline), and Month 24 
(14 g increase from baseline) and Month 36 (25 g increase from baseline). 
An analysis of ADHD inattention and PKU-POMS confusion subscales by change in blood phenylalanine 
from baseline quartiles showed that patients with the largest phenylalanine reductions (Quartile 1) 
experienced the greatest improvements in ADHD inattention and PKU-POMS confusion subscales 
(see Figure 20).

from baseline in blood phenylalanine quartiles at last observation of last enrolled study  
As none of the clinical studies in the dossier were designed to assess pegvaliase response based on 
previous response to prior treatment, the applicant performed post-hoc analysis to support the claimed 
indication “Palynziq is indicated for the treatment of adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have 
inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater than 600 µmol/l) despite prior

management with available treatment options ”. Different patient populations were defined by the 
applicant. The data from the Principal MAA 3rd Line Subpopulation was compared with the data from the 
I/T/M Population. 
The applicant compared the data of blood phenylalanine in the different populations: I/T/M Population 
(n=285), Principal MAA 3rd Line Subpopulation (n=180), and subpopulations: sapropterin 
non-responders (n=144), patients on a diet (>75% of daily food intake comes from MNT) (n=41) and 
sapropterin non-responders on MNT (n=57). The baseline demographics were balanced. Baseline 
phenylalanine values were balanced, except for those patients that are on >75% MNT. The subpopulation 
“sapropterin non-responders on MNT” reflects the proposed indication. 
Baseline phenylalanine levels were 1331.2 (358.6) mean (SD) μmol/L in the Principal MAA 3rd Line 
Subpopulation, 1227.3 (379.3) μmol/L for the I/T/M Population, 901.2 (266.2) μmol/L in the sapropterin 
non-responders, 1116.3 (336.5) in patients on MNT with >75% from medical food and 1227.3 (379.3) 
μmol/L sapropterin non-responders on MNT.  
In Table 21 the change from baseline after 12 months of pegvaliase treatment in the different population 
is presented.

baseline in ADHD-RS IA in subjects with baseline score of >9 at months 12, 18 and 24 
were -7.8 (5.5), -8.9 (5.8) and -9.6 (5.9) points, respectively.  
The mean (SD) score change from baseline in the POMS self-rated TMD at months 12, 
18 and 24 were -16.9 (32.6), -20.0 (34.2) and 20.1 (35.5) points, respectively 
The proportion of responders in the total population for ADHD-RS IA using this CIR 
threshold at 12, 18 and 24 months was 57/172 subjects (33.1%), 64/168 subjects 
(38.1%), and 67/160 subjects (41.9%). The proportion of responders in the ADHD-RS 
IA subscale in the subjects with a baseline score >9 at 12, 18 and 24 months was 42/80 
subjects (52.5%), 50/78 subjects (64.1%), and 54/76 subjects (71.1%).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant defined the Induction, Titration, Maintenance Population (N=285) which includes subjects 
whose overall pegvaliase treatment followed an induction, titration, and maintenance treatment regimen, 
similar to the proposed treatment regimen. This population includes data from subjects originally enrolled 
in parent studies 165-205 and 165-301 and data from the extension studies to which they transferred 
(PAL-003 and 165-302). 
For the subjects in the I/T/M Population who reached and completed 12 months of treatment (184/285), 
blood Phe concentrations were reduced by a mean (SD) of 674.9 μmol/L (579.6; n = 184) to a mean (SD) 
blood Phe level of 546.6 (520.8) μmol/L at 12 months ). Reductions to≤600 μmol/L (controlled Phe) were 
achieved by 56.0% (n = 103) and reductions to ≤ 120 μmol/L (normalized Phe) were achieved by 37.0% 
(n = 68). 
For the subjects in the I/T/M Population who reached and completed 24 months of treatment (67/285), 
blood Phe concentrations were reduced by a mean (SD) of 913.6 μmol/L (528.3; n = 67) to a mean (SD) 
blood Phe level of 294.3 (398.0) μmol/L. 
Reductions to ≤ 600 μmol/L (controlled Phe) were achieved by 82.1% (n = 55) and reductions to ≤ 120 
μmol/L (normalized Phe) were achieved by 50.7% (n = 34) 
Mean (SE) Phe concentration over time is presented for the I/T/M Population in Figure 21.

Study PAL-003 is an ongoing long-term extension of a phase II, open-label, dose-finding study to 
evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of multiple subcutaneous doses of rAvPAL-PEG in patients 
with PKU. The study duration is up to 354 weeks.  
Adults with PKU who had completed a previous Phase II study (PAL-002, PAL-004, 165-205) were eligible 
for participation in this study.  
Eighty (80) patients from the preceding (parent) phase II studies (PAL-002 (n=40); PAL-004 (n=16) and 
165-205 (n=24)) were enrolled. In total 68 patients were treated with pegvaliase. 
Thirty-five (35) out of 80 (44%) of patients in the parent studies of PAL-003 (studies PAL-002 + PAL-004 
+ 165-205) had blood phenylalanine levels ≤600 µmol/L from baseline in the phase II studies. Under 
continued treatment in PAL-003 (either on the same dose or an increased dose to achieve the target 
phenylalanine level) an additional 24 patients showed phenylalanine levels ≤600 µmol/L (59/68 patients; 
87%) from baseline phase II.  
Up to week 192 (≈3.5 years) under continued pegvaliase treatment patients were capable to increase 
their natural protein intake whilst maintaining phenylalanine levels ≤600 µmol/L. After week 264 the 
patient numbers are too small to draw firm conclusions.  
Study 165-303 
Study 165-303 was a substudy of study 165-302. The study only included 9 patients (6 patients on active 
treatment and 3 patients on placebo in study 165-302 part 2). This study investigates neurocognitive and 
neuropsychiatric function of the patient based in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated 
Battery (CANTAB). However, given the limited number of patients included, no firm conclusions can be 
drawn from this study. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical program for pegvaliase was conducted in US centres only. Given the fact that pegvaliase is an 
enzyme substitution therapy it is considered unlikely that differences would have been observed in an EU 
population.  
The applicant defined different phases of treatment for the patients included in the clinical trials, namely 
induction, titration and maintenance (I/T/M). 
During the induction phase of studies 165-205 and 165-301 (week 1 - 4) a fixed dose of 2.5 mg/week was 
used, in order to desensitise the patient to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. This fixed dose was 
chosen as in the preceding phase II studies it was shown that when using a dose higher than 2.5 mg/week 
the clearance of pegvaliase was too high and no drug concentration could be measured.  
Due to the doses and its duration, data collected in the induction phase of the various studies are 
important only from a safety perspective whereas, the maintenance phase data are considered pivotal to 
demonstrate efficacy of pegvaliase. 
Study 165-301 
The patients (n=261) enrolled in study 165-301 received a 4 week induction period and a titration varying 
from 5 to 30 weeks. Of those patients who reached the maintenance phase (n=195), 171 patients 
completed the maintenance phase at the assigned randomised dose (e.g. 20 or 40 mg/day). Twelve 
patients completed the randomised dose below or above the assigned dose. The sample size declined 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 77/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from 261 at baseline to 80 at week 36. Efficacy assessments were collected up to 14 days from the date 
of the last dose taken. The reported effects are therefore on patients “while on treatment”, rather than the 
more commonly accepted efficacy in an ITT population.  
The study enrolled patients with phenylalanine levels >600 μmol/L. This included patients who had never 
received any treatment other than a restricted diet, patients who received sapropterin but still had 
phenylalanine levels ≤600 µmol/L), or patients that  did not respond to sapropterin treatment.  
The applicant’s rationale to conduct this study as an open label, non-blinded study was accepted as 
blinding would not be possible due to the hypersensitivity reactions triggered by pegvaliase 
administration, particularly during dose the induction and titration phases. Due to the lack of a placebo 
group some form of bias cannot be excluded, especially pertaining to the clinical efficacy endpoints (e.g., 
protein intake and neurocognitive /neuropsychiatric endpoints).  Nevertheless, the lack of a placebo was 
considered acceptable as the clinical efficacy endpoints in this study were exploratory in nature. 
Study 165-302 part 1 
Patients who participated in previous studies (phase II studies and 165-301) were eligible for inclusion in 
part 1 of study 165-302 if the patients had been on a stable randomised pegvaliase dose (20 or 40 
mg/day) for at least 2 weeks in study. Most patients in the phase II studies were titrated based on 
phenylalanine levels (≤600 µmol/L) and tolerability which is in line with the treatment strategy in clinical 
practice. 152 patients who completed the maintenance phase in study 165-301 were included in part 1 of 
study 165-302. As the minimum duration to reach maintenance was 9 weeks and 25 weeks at maximum, 
patients who entered part 1 of study 302 received an additional 13 weeks of maintenance treatment. 
Patients who progressed up to end part 3 (n=82) had a maintenance duration of 36 to 52 weeks when 
entering part 4.  
At the start of part 1 of the study patients received the VS as pharmaceutical form, however during the 
study part PFS was introduced as new pharmaceutical form. A total of 52 patients were on 20 mg 
pegvaliase PFS, 56 patients on 40 mg pegvaliase PFS, 53 patients on 20 mg pegvaliase VS and 50 patients 
on 40 mg pegvaliase VS completed study 165-301. Due to the early closure of study 165-301 only few 
patients who achieved the target dose using the PFS were transitioned to part 1 of study 165-302 (n=11). 
The majority of the patients using the PFS were transitioned to part 4 of study 165-302 which is the same 
as the product to be commercialised.  
Study 165-302 part 2 
The randomized discontinuation (RDT), placebo-controlled design in Part 2 of Study 165-302 was chosen 
principally to demonstrate the effect of the 8 weeks withdrawal of pegvaliase on previously controlled 
blood phenylalanine levels. This design was appropriate to show the short-term effects of the withdrawal 
of pegvaliase treatment on blood phenylalanine levels, as it was known from previous studies that blood 
phenylalanine levels would change rapidly.  
The patient population to be enrolled in part 2 of study 165-302 was enriched with patients who had 
≥20% reduction of phenylalanine from baseline study 165-301 (n=77) or preceding phase II study 
PAL-003 or Study 165-205 (n=9). This was the mITT population.  
As a secondary endpoint the applicant looked at neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric scores. However, the 
CHMP questioned whether a relevant clinical effect on these scores could be observed in this short study 
period. In this respect part 4 of study 165-302 is considered to more relevant for assessing the effect of 
treatment on those outcomes.

Study 165-302 part 4 
Part 4 is an ongoing open-label long-term follow part study. 190 patients from Study 165-301 were 
included in this part, meaning that 7.2% (n=71) of the patients discontinued during the clinical program 
for various reasons. It should be noted that patients who discontinued where not considered in the 
primary analyses. These analyses included measurements of patients up to 14 days of the last dose 
received (regardless of whether this was the end of the study).  
Neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric symptom scores were collected in this part of the study. Patients who 
were either on 20 mg/day or 40 mg/day and did not achieve a target blood phenylalanine level of ≤600 
µmol/L could be titrated to 40 or 60 mg/day.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 165-301 
Treatment with pegvaliase gradually reduced mean blood Phe concentration for both the 20 mg/day and 
the 40 mg/day randomized dose groups and mean blood Phe concentration decreases wer greater in the 
40 mg/day compared to the 20 mg/day. 
The primary analysis using the MMRM resulted in differences in LS means (95% CI)of -923.25 
(-1135.04, -711.46) µmol/l (p<0.0001) for the pooled active vs. the 20 mg/day placebo groups 
and -638.27 (-858.97, -417.57) µmol/l (p<0.0001) for the pooled active vs. the 40 mg/day placebo 
groups.  
It is difficult to conclude on the magnitude of the effect of pegvaliase on Phe levels as most patients either 
discontinued or transitioned to Study 165-302 when the target dose was reached. 
Study 165-302 part 2 
The difference from baseline in blood Phe concentrations between patients randomized to active group 
(pooled) and the placebo groups (20 mg/day and 40 mg/day) was statistically significant (P<0.0001).  
This comparison was done as placebo groups were not comparable according to the study protocol. 
Comparisons of the LS mean differences in change from blood Phe concentration (95% CI) from the start 
of Part 2 (baseline) to the end of Part 2 (Week 8) showed that the difference in LS means was -923.25 
μmol/L and statistically significant between the pooled active group versus the 20 mg/day placebo group 
(-1135.04 to -711.46; P < 0.0001). Additionally, the difference in LS means between the pooled active 
group versus the 40 mg/day placebo group was -638.27 μmol/L and was also statistically significant 
(-858.97 to -417.57; P < 0.0001). 
Analysis of the difference in other secondary efficacy endpoints (ADHD-RS IV Inattention Subscale for all 
subjects, PKU POMS Confusion Subscale, PKU POMS TMD, and POMS TMD) did not show significant 
differences in symptoms between subjects who remained on pegvaliase versus those who were 
administered placebo during Part 2. This was expected due to the short duration of this phase of the 
study. 
Study 165-302 Part 4 
In part 4 of the study, at database lock 23 September 2016 (week 41) 65.3% of the patients achieved a 
blood phenylalanine level ≤600 μmol/L after treatment was initiated in study 165-301. After 30 months 
of total pegvaliase treatment from baseline study 165-301, 73% of patients achieved a blood 
phenylalanine level ≤600 μmol/L (data cut-off 5 February 2018). 
The median change from baseline part 4 up to week 41 for blood phenylalanine levels for the difference 
dosing categories was -1109.0 μmol/L in the <20 mg/day (n=38), -1126 μmol/L in the 20 -<40 mg/day 
Assessment report

(n=112), -761 in the 40-<60 mg/day (n=181) and -516 in the ≥60 mg/day (n=69) group. These 
reductions were sustained up to 18 months of pegvaliase treatment. After 30 months total treatment 
from baseline study 165-301 73% of the patients showed a response. As a stopping rule it is stated, in 
SmPC section 4.4, that both the physician and patient need to reconsider pegvaliase treatment if after 18 
months no satisfactory response is observed. Depending on other beneficial effects observed, the 
physician/patient may decide to continue treatment.   
From part 4 baseline to week 41, only numerical changes in ADHD Inattention Score for the difference 
dosing categories (e.g. <20 mg/day, ≥20 -<40 mg/day (n=130), ≥40-<60 mg/day (n=185) and ≥60 
mg/day (n=69)) were observed. For the PKU-POMS a similar trend is observed.  
Based on published literature (Spencer 2010 et al) a 5.2 points difference for ADHD-RS is considered the 
minimal important clinical difference (MICD). Analysis showed that after 18 months of treatment the 
MICD of 5.2 points was exceeded. In patients who are more symptomatic (ADHD-RS IA with baseline 
score of >9) this MCID was exceeded after 12 months of treatment. 
An analysis of ADHD inattention and PKU POMS confusion subscales by change in blood phenylalanine 
from baseline quartiles, showed that patients with the largest phenylalanine reductions (Quartile 1) 
experienced the greatest improvements in ADHD inattention and PKU POMS confusion subscales. 
In this part of the study, dose could be increased to 60 mg/day in subjects that had had more 
than 52 weeks of pegvaliase treatment (combined duration of therapy in 165-302 and previous studies), 
and a minimum of 8 weeks of treatment at 40 mg/day. 
Substantial reduction in blood phenylalanine was observed after dose increase to 60 mg/day. In subjects 
who were titrated to 60 mg/day in 165-302 and maintained that dose for at least 4 weeks with at least 
80% compliance (60 mg/day stable cohort), the mean (SD) blood phenylalanine levels were reduced 
from 1083.7 (370.53) µmol/l to 700.3 (546.25) µmol/l at 16 weeks and to 560.9 (488.39) µmol/l at 
32 weeks after dose increase. Reduction in blood phenylalanine was maintained through 72 weeks of 
dosing.  
For this reason the maximum recommended dose of pegvaliase is 60mg daily in the maintenance phase 
of treatment. This follows an induction phase, with a recommended starting dosage of pegvaliase of 2.5 
mg administered once per week for 4 weeks in line with the induction phase of Study 165-301. The 
dosage should then be escalated gradually based on tolerability to the daily maintenance dosage required 
to achieve blood phenylalanine level of 120 to 600 µmol/l. The maintenance dosage is individualised to 
achieve patient’s blood phenylalanine control (i.e., a phenylalanine level between 120 to 600 µmol/l) 
taking into account patient tolerability to pegvlaiase and dietary protein intake.  
PAL-003 
Data up to 3.5 years of follow-up showed that under continued pegvaliase treatment patients show a 
further decrease of blood phenylalanine levels and numerical improvement in the neurocognitive/ 
neuropsychiatric symptoms scores.  
Additional analyses 
Overall treatment experience from Study 301 and Study 302 
At the time of the data cut off, 188 out of the 261 patients received treatment for at least 1 year, 4 
patients completed treatment, and 69 discontinued treatment in the first year. Of these 188 patients, 164 
patients received treatment for at least 2 years, 2 patients continued treatment but had not yet reached 
2 years of treatment, and 22 patients discontinued in the second year, and 9 patients discontinued after 
2 years of treatment. Of the 100 patients who discontinued treatment, 40 patients discontinued due to an 
adverse event, 29 patients discontinued due to patient decision, 10 patients discontinued due to physician 
Assessment report

Page 80/110 
 
 
 
decision, and 21 patients discontinued to other reasons (e.g. lost to follow up, pregnancy, or protocol 
deviation). 
Mean blood phenylalanine levels reduced from 1233 µmol/l at baseline to 565 micromol/l at Month 12 
(Nn=164) and 345 µmol/l at Month 24 (Nn =90), and these reductions in mean blood phenylalanine levels 
were maintained through Month 36 (341 µmol/l; Nn =48) (see Table 4 and Figure 1). Median change from 
baseline was 634 micromol/l at Month 12,  965 micromol/l at Month 24, and  913 µmol/l at Month 36. 
The data indicate that the reduction of phenylalanine after 12 months of pegvaliase treatment in the 
post-hoc defined 3rd Line Subpopulation does not significantly differ from the I/T/M or sapropterin 
non-responders irrespective of diet. Similar results were obtained after 24 months of treatment.  
Considering that some patients in this condition can potentially be managed by a restricted diet, it was 
proposed to modify the indication applied by the applicant by removing reference to sapropterin to ensure 
that pegvaliase would only be used in patients who have exhausted all other means to control their 
phenylalanine blood levels. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the indication for pegvaliase should be 
for the treatment patients with PKU and uncontrolled blood phenylalanine levels >600 μmol/L despite 
prior management with available treatment options. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Only twelve paediatric patients aged 16 to 18 years were included in the clinical programme (efficacy data 
was available for 11 patients and safety data for all 12 patients). After 36 months continued treatment 8 
out 12 patients reached blood phenylalanine levels ≤600 µmol/L. No consistent differences in antibody 
titers or adverse events incidences between the paediatric group and the adult group were observed. 
Therefore the indication for pegvaliase includes patients from 16 years of age. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of pegvaliase is mainly based on a pharmacodynamic effect which has been 
convincingly demonstrated. The data, in patients aged 16 years and older, demonstrate that in the 
maintenance phase under continued pegvaliase treatment blood phenylalanine levels reduced to target 
levels of ≤600 µmol/L in the majority of patients. This effect appears to be sustained in most patients as 
demonstrated in the longer term studies. Based on the knowledge of the natural history of the disease this 
is considered an important effect.  
Even though the effects of treatment on other reported outcomes are more difficult to confirm as they are 
mainly based on uncontrolled data, available evidence also suggest that with pegvaliase treatment 
patients showed some improvement in the neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms and were capable 
of increasing their protein intake from intact foods, and increase the intake of phenylalanine.  
Overall, it was concluded that pegvaliase is an effective treatment of patients with phenylketonuria who 
have inadequate blood phenylalanine control.

The I/T/M Population which pooled data from patients from parent studies 165-205 and 165-301 and 
where the induction, titration, and maintenance treatment regimen was used, n=285) is considered to be 
the most clinically relevant. All of these patients received induction treatment (18.4 person-years of total 
treatment exposure), 273 patients underwent titration (269.3 person-years) and 175 patients received 
maintenance treatment (409.3 person-years).  
In the I/T/M Population, 73.3% (209/285) have had at least 1 year of exposure, 63.5% (181/285) have 
had at least 2 years of pegvaliase exposure, 40.7% (116/285) have had at least 3 years of pegvaliase 
exposure, and 18.9% (54/285) have had at least 4 years of exposure (Table 25). Exposure by dose level 
in this population is summarised in Table 26.

Adverse events 
All patients in the I/T/M Population experienced at least 1 drug-related Adverse Event (AE) (Table 27). 
Assessment of an AE as being drug related and this was determined at the investigators discretion based 
on “reasonable possibility” (e.g. temporal relationship between AE occurrence and pegvaliase dose, 
presence of other pre-disposing factors).

The overall exposure-adjusted AE rate in the I/T/M Population was lower at higher dose levels, with rates 
of 42.77, 30.67, 20.37 and 15.44 AEs/person-year for the <20, ≥20 to <40, 40 to <60, and ≥60 mg/day 
dose levels, respectively. The rate of AEs assessed by the investigator as study drug-related also declined 
as the dose level increased (32.54, 20.51, 10.81, and 6.95 AEs/person-year for the <20, ≥20 to <40,

a Additional Adverse Events Upgraded to Serious due to Medical Significance by the Sponsor in the Safety Database are 
included in this table. 
The most frequently reported SAE reported in patients were anaphylactic reactions. 
Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions led to withdrawal of the drug in half of the patients and to dose 
interruptions/dose reductions in the other half of the patients. Blood CPK increase was reported by five 
patients. Due to the occurrence of other predisposing factors (e.g. starting new exercise regimens), this 
SAE was assessed as unrelated to pegvaliase. 
Deaths 
Across the pegvaliase clinical studies, one death due to accidental electrocution was reported in the Phase 
III study, 165-301. This event was assessed as unrelated to the study drug which is acceptable. 
Other significant events 
Immunological events 
As a foreign derived therapeutic protein, pegvaliase has immunogenic potential. Hypersensitivity events 
were reported in the pegvaliase clinical studies by 93.7% of patients in the I/T/M Population, with most 
patients experiencing mild (Grade 1: 18.2%) or moderate (Grade 2: 62.5%). In cases were HAEs lead to 
permanent drug withdrawal this was often due to a combination of recurrent multiple mild to moderate 
events.  
The most commonly reported HAEs (by PT) in the I/T/M Population were injection site reactions (93.3%), 
arthralgia (84.6%), hypersensitivity reactions (74.7%), headache (54.7% rash (38.9%),%, nausea 
(35.1%), pruritus (31.9%) and urticaria (30.5%).. HAEs occurred most frequently in the first 6 months of 
treatment and peaked after three weeks of treatment (part of the induction phase). HAEs were 
dose-independent. The incidence of HAE episodes in patients receiving placebo doses was 14.3%.  
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, consistent with the NIAID/FAAN clinical diagnostic criteria for 
likely anaphylaxis, were the most clinically important identified risks in the pegvaliase development 
program. Using the NIAID/FAAN clinical criteria, potential episodes of acute systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions were evaluated by an independent expert (allergist/immunologist).  
In the I/T/M population, 16 patients experienced 25 acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions. In 11 of 
the 25 events, epinephrine was administered. The incidence was highest, but not exclusive to the first 6 
months of treatment. No clear dose-relationship was observed. Following a request from the CHMP the 
applicant aimed to identify risk factors for ASHRs. No relationship with age, gender, baseline 
phenylalanine, cumulative dose, time from last dose to events, last blood phenylalanine before event or 
concomitant medication was identified (Table 29).

Due to the occurrence of the ASHRs, a protocol amendment with risk minimization measures (RMMs) was 
instated that required pre-treatment with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and antipyretic medications 
before the injections. In addition, a trained observer should be present the first 16 weeks of treatment 
and an epi-pen should be carried by the patient. The amount of discontinuations decreased after the 
instatement of the RMM (from 23.8% to 13.6% in the first 6 months and from 32.9% to 18.6% in the first 
year).  
There were 2 subjects in the PAL-001 single dose study, excluded from the MD and I/T/M Populations, 
who were concurrently using another PEGylated injectable, medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), at the 
time of their pegvaliase dose. These 2 subjects experienced a total of 3 episodes of hypersensitivity 
reactions, associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone, of which 1 episode in 1 subject was an acute 
systemic hypersensitivity reaction meeting the NIAID/FAAN criteria. 
Immunogenicity 
All patients treated with pegvaliase developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Overall, the pattern of 
antibody development was generally similar across all studies in the pegvaliase clinical program, 
regardless of the dosing schedule during the induction/titration period. All patients developed sustained 
antibodies against the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) protein, and the majority of patients 
developed transient antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Figure 23).

Data demonstrated an association between antibody response and adverse events. Typically, 
hypersensitivity adverse events occurred most frequently during the first six months of treatment when 
the early immune response comprised of PEG IgM, PEG IgG and PAL IgM responses peaked, C3/C4 levels 
declined, and CIC levels were at their highest. The frequency of HAEs decreased over time in long term 
treatment as the incidence of these antibodies decreased. With prolonged treatment, C3/C4 levels did not 
return to baseline for the patients in the highest quartiles. Additional analysis provided by the applicant 
compared the incidences of AE of interest in patients with complement C3 and C4 < lower limit of normal 
(LLN) and >LLN. Safety data was available from 180 subjects with greater than 1 year of data and 159 
subjects with greater than 2 years of data. There was a trend observed for higher incidences of 
lymphadenopathy for those subjects with low C3 (7.6% vs 2.7%) but the same trend was not seen with 
low C4 (4.8% vs 5.8%). No significant differences were found in the other AE categories. 
Since complement C3 and C4 are an essential part of the innate immune system, it was of concern that 
long term suppression of complement levels might suppress the immune system. However, no clear 
difference was observed between patients with C3 < LLN and > LLN; 17.1% and 16.0% of the patients 
respectively (infections and infestations >30 days) for the first year and 17.3% vs 15.5% for the second 
year.  
In general, an association between ADA titres and frequency of hypersensitivity reactions and injection 
site reactions was observed for some antibody analytes, such that patients who had lower mean titres 
experienced fewer hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions. Patients who experienced 
anaphylaxis events had higher mean antibody titres for some analytes than patients that did not 
experience anaphylaxis, and ADA titres at the time of an anaphylaxis event tended to be higher than the 
mean over the entire study. However, individual titres overlapped between patients who experienced 
anaphylaxis events and those who did not; as a result, no specific antibody titres could be identified as 
predictive of an HAE or anaphylactic event. 
Hypophenylalaninaemia 
In the I/T/M Population, 125 (43.9%) patients met the definition of hypophenylalaninaemia (at least 2 
consecutive blood phenylalanine levels <30 μmol/L). In 80% of the patients, phenylalanine levels 
dropped below 5 µmol/L (limit of detection of the assay). The median time to onset from the first dose to 
the first hypophenylalaninaemia event was 393 days (range 51 to 1,405 days) and the median duration 
of hypophenylalaninaemia events was 161 days (range 35 to 1,408 days). Measures were included in the 
protocol to prevent hypophenylalaninaemia (regular blood phenylalanine measurements, possibility for 
dose decrease and consultation of a dietician to increase protein intake).  
In the I/T/M Population, incidences for most of the AE categories were lower in the 
hypophenylalaninaemia group compared to the group of patients that did not experience 
hypophenylalaninaemia including overall AEs (96 % vs 100%), investigator assessed treatment-related 
AEs (81.6% vs 100%), SAEs (8.8% vs 23.1%) and CTCAE ≥ Grade 3 events (8.8% vs 28.1%). Only the 
PTs of ‘alopecia’ and ‘amino acid level decreased’ had both higher patient incidence and event rates in the 
hypophenylalaninaemia group.   
Angioedema 
A total of 21 (7.4%) subjects experienced 37 episodes of angioedema in the I/T/M Population with a rate 
of 0.06 episodes/person-year. Within 37 episodes of angioedema, 43 AE PTs were reported. All reported 
episodes of angioedema were CTCAE Grade 1 (31 episodes in 16 [5.6%] subjects) or Grade 2 (6 episodes 
in 5 [1.8%] subjects) and there were no Grade 3 or 4 AEs (Table 8.13.24). The most frequently reported 
AE PTs associated with angioedema episodes in the I/T/M Population were swelling face (2.5%) swollen 
tongue (1.8%), lip swelling (1.1%), and pharyngeal oedema (1.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 88/110 
 
 
 
Of the 21 subjects who reported angioedema episodes in the I/T/M Population, 11 (3.9%) subjects 
reported while on pegvaliase dose levels of > 0 to < 20 mg/day, 9 (3.5%) subjects on ≥ 20 to < 40 
mg/day and the remaining 3 (1.4%) on ≥ 40 to < 60 mg/day.  
In the I/T/M Population, the mean (SD) time to onset of the angioedema episode from the most recent 
pegvaliase dose was 26.8 (114.90) hours with a median (range) time to onset of 0 (0 [i.e. immediately 
following dosing] to 696) hours. Of the 37 episodes of angioedema, 29 occurred on the same day of 
dosing, 5 occurred within 1 day after the last dose, and 1 episode each was reported 3 and 4 days, 
respectively, after the last dose; in addition one subject experienced an episode (reported AE of swollen 
tongue, that lasted for a day, for which the dosing was interrupted) 29 days (696 hours) after last dose 
received.  
Serum Sickness-Like Reactions 
In the I/T/M Population, using the broadest search strategy (PTs of serum sickness and serum 
sickness-like reaction plus a symptomatic search), 9 episodes of serum sickness with 13 events were 
reported in 9 subjects (3.2%; 0.02 AEs/person-year). 
Seven of the 9 episodes were reported PTs of serum sickness; the remaining two episodes in two subjects 
included events of arthralgia and pyrexia with either rash or allergic dermatitis. 
In the I/T/M Population, using the modified search strategy (which focused on the actual reported PTs of 
serum sickness or serum sickness-like reaction omitting the symptomatic search), 7 AEs in 7 subjects 
with reported PTs of serum sickness were identified (2.5%; 0.01 AEs/person-year). No additional subject 
reported serum sickness in the MD Population. 
Of the 7 subjects who reported serum sickness in the I/T/M Population, 6 (2.1%; 0.05 AEs/person-year) 
subjects reported while on pegvaliase dose levels of > 0 to < 20 mg/day, and the remaining 1 (1.4%; 
0.01 AEs/person-year) subject on ≥ 40 to < 60 mg/day. 
Of the 7 subjects who reported serum sickness in the I/T/M Population, 4 subjects experienced Grade 2 
AEs (1.4%), and 3 subjects experienced Grade 3 AEs (1.1%), which resulted in treatment discontinuation 
for 2 subjects. Both of these AEs were reported as SAEs; the remaining 5 episodes were non-serious 
events. All 7 AEs of serum sickness resolved without sequelae and had a duration of 1 to 8 days. Of the 
7 subjects who reported serum sickness, 2 subjects discontinued treatment and 5 subjects continued 
treatment without experiencing a recurrence; serum sickness in these 5 subjects was managed with drug 
interruption, dose reduction, and/or concomitant medication. 
Arthralgia 
Of the 285 subjects in the I/T/M Population, 241 (85 %) reported 1,876 AEs of arthralgia (2.67 events per 
patient-year).  
Arthralgia occurred as early as the first dose and also occurred at any time during treatment. Arthralgia 
was most frequent during Induction and Titration phases (223/285; 78% of subjects; 1264 episodes over 
a mean treatment period of 12 months likely due to the levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) 
being highest during this period and decreased in the Maintenance Phase (62% of patients; 612 episodes 
over a mean treatment period of 28 months ). 
The mean duration of arthralgia was 15 days and 78% of arthralgia episodes had a duration of less than 
14 days. Arthralgia persisted up to 936 days (1% of arthralgia episodes persisted at least 180 days). 
Severe arthralgia (severe pain limiting self-care activities of daily living) was experienced in 14 (5%) 
patients. Arthralgia episodes were managed with concomitant medicinal products (e.g., nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and/or antipyretic), dosage reduction (4% of episodes), 
Assessment report

treatment interruption (4% of episodes), or treatment withdrawal (0.6% of episodes), and 97% of 
arthralgia episodes resolved by the time of the data cut off. 
While the specific location on the body for AEs of arthralgia was not systematically collected, a review of 
the reported verbatim terms for these events shows that the arthralgia events were widespread but more 
common in the extremities and back. 
Persistent arthralgia (lasting at least 6 months) occurred in 19 (7%) patients with a total of 24 episodes. 
Persistent arthralgia occurred as early as 6 days and up to 1,526 days into treatment (median: 566 days 
from treatment initiation). The dose was not changed for 23 (96%) episodes and dose was reduced for 1 
(4%) episode. All persistent arthralgia episodes resolved without sequelae. 
Injection site reactions 
In the I/T/M Population, 266 (93%) subjects experienced 5,009 AEs related to episodes of ISRs. All ISRs 
were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. The most common ISRs (occurring in at least 10% of subjects) were 
bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, rash, swelling, urticaria and induration.  
ISRs were most frequent during Induction and Titration Phase (90% of patients; 3,899 episodes over 
mean treatment duration of 12 months) and decreased in Maintenance Phase (64% of patients; 1110 
over a mean treatment period of 28 months).  
Injection site reactions occurred as early as the first dose and can occur at any time during treatment. The 
mean duration of injection site reaction was 9 days, and 91% of injection site reactions had a duration of 
less than 14 days 0.8% of injections site reactions persisted at least 180 days, and 99% of injection site 
reactions resolved by the time of the data cut off.  
Three ISRs consistent with granulomatous skin lesions were reported (each reaction occurring in one 
patient): granulomatous dermatitis (occurred 15 months after Palynziq treatment and lasted 16 days), 
xanthogranuloma (occurred 12 months after initiation of treatment and lasted 21 months), and 
necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (occurred 12 months after initiation of treatment and lasted 12 
months). Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum was treated with steroid injections and complicated by 
Pseudomonas infection. All of these injection site reactions resolved. One patient reported soft tissue 
infection associated with mesenteric panniculitis, which resulted in treatment discontinuation 
There was an inverse relationship between incidences of ISRs in the I/T/M Population and dose, with the 
lowest incidences of ISRs occurring in subjects treated at ≥ 60 mg/day pegvaliase (34.4%) and the 
highest incidences of ISRs occurring in subjects treated at > 0 and < 20 mg/day pegvaliase (85.3%). The 
incidences of ISRs in subjects receiving placebo doses was 25.0%. 
Laboratory findings 
Changes in laboratory parameters observed in haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis during 
clinical studies were not considered clinically meaningful or related to pegvaliase.

Safety in special populations 
The majority of the patients in the I/T/M population were between 18 and 65 years of age (n=273). 
Twelve patients were included aged 16-18. No patients >65 years were included in the studies. There was 
no difference in the safety profile in the 16-18 year group versus the 18-65 year group.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal studies of drug-drug or drug-disease interactions were submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 37.5% of the patients discontinued the study drug at least one time during the study. The 
majority of these discontinuations occurred during the initiation/titration phase (30.9%). Of the total 
number of discontinuations, 41.1% was due to adverse events.  
Overall, 33% of the patients withdrew from the study of which the majority occurred during the 
initiation/titration phase (27.0%). Of the total study withdrawals, 27.7% was due to adverse events.  
The events leading to drug discontinuation or study withdrawal were predominantly hypersensitivity and 
acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Pegvaliase treatment follows an induction/titration/maintenance dosing regimen. Patient are started on 
2.5 mg pegvaliase once a week to induce tolerability by desensitising the immune system. This phase is 
followed by a titration phase during which the dose is increased in a stepwise manner to a dose tolerated 
by the patients and achieving the optimal clinical effect (preferably a phenylalanine serum level below 600 
µmol/L. After the titration phase the treatment enters the stable maintenance phase in which the lowest 
effective dosage to achieve and maintain blood phenylalanine control is continued.  
In the pegvaliase clinical program, 341 patients received multiple doses of pegvaliase, constituting the 
MD safety population. The I/T/M safety population includes all patients who were administered pegvaliase 
using the induction, titration and maintenance regimen. This population includes data from subjects first 
enrolled in the parent studies 165-205 or 165-301 and from the subsequent extension studies to which 
they transferred (PAL-003 and 165-302). The I/T/M population is considered to be the most clinically 
relevant. Even though the overall number of patients in the safety population is small according to the ICH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 91/110 
 
 
 
 
guideline E1 on assessment of clinical safety, given the low incidence of PKU (1 per 10.000 births), it was 
considered acceptable.  
In the I/T/M Population, 73.3% (209/285) have had at least 1 year of exposure, 63.5% (181/285) have 
had at least 2 years of pegvaliase exposure, 40.7%(116/285) have had at least 3 years of pegvaliase 
exposure, and 18.9% (54/285) have had at least 4 years of exposure. Thus, a substantial amount of the 
total study population (209 patients) had at least one year exposure to the study drug which is sufficient 
according to ICH guidelines.  
All patients in the I/T/M Population (N=285) experienced at least 1 drug-related AE. The most common 
drug-related AEs among patients were injection site reactions (93.3%), arthralgia (84.6%), 
hypersensitivity reactions (74.7%), headache (54.7% rash (38.9%),%, nausea (35.1%), pruritus 
(31.9%) and urticaria (30.5%).These adverse events are considered related to the hypersensitivity 
reactions observed in all patients.  
A total of 91 SAEs were reported, of which 42 were assessed as treatment related. Overall it is reassuring 
that all SAEs resolved. The most commonly reported SAE PTs (>2 events) included anaphylactic reaction, 
hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid reaction, blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, and anxiety. The 
SAE occurred more frequently in the early treatment phase and were dose-independent.  
There is limited data on the comparison of AE incidence in the treatment groups versus the placebo group. 
In part this is due to the study design of a discontinuation trial in which patients were withdrawn from the 
study drug for 8 weeks in part 2 of study 165-302. All patients had been exposed to the drug before being 
randomized to the placebo group, so all patients had already had an immune response against 
pegvaliase. In addition, the total treatment exposure in the placebo group was only a small proportion of 
the treatment exposure in the pegvaliase dosing groups.  
The incidence of all adverse was assessed per treatment phase (induction, titration and maintenance) In 
general, the incidence of AEs decreased with treatment duration. AEs are generally highest in the 
induction/titration phase when the immune-response against pegvaliase peaks. The only AE that has a 
higher incidence in the maintenance phase is hypophenylalaninaemia.  
Although the incidence of AEs was relatively high in the lower dose group (between 0 and 20 mg/day), 
this can be explained since all patients received this dose in the induction/titration phase which is also the 
phase in which most immune-response related AEs occur. The AEs seem to be dose independent. This is 
supported by data from part 4 of study 165-302, in which some patients were up-titrated from 40 mg/day 
to 60 mg/day. This did not lead to a significant increase of AE’s one month before versus one month after 
the dose increase. Doses up to 60 mg/day are thus not associated with an increase in AEs. An integrated 
analysis of AE profile per dose group for the new data cut-off will be submitted once the final study reports 
from the ongoing studies PAL-003 and 165-302 are available.  
AEs were most commonly mild to moderate (grade 1 [7.0%]) and grade 2 [68.4%]). Grade 3 and 4 AEs 
were reported by 22.1% and 2.1% respectively. One patient died by electrocution during the study which 
was assessed as being unrelated to the study drug.  
The most frequent AEs were hypersensitivity AEs, occurring in almost all patients (93.7% of all patients 
in the I/T/M population). The most common (>20% of patients) HAEs in the I/T/M Population were 
injection site reactions (93.3%), arthralgia (84.6%), hypersensitivity reactions (74.7%), headache 
(54.7% rash (38.9%),%, nausea (35.1%), pruritus (31.9%), abdominal pain (31.2%), urticaria 
(30.5%), vomiting (30.2%). Cough (29.1%) Most patients experienced mild (Grade 1: 18.2%) or 
moderate (Grade 2: 62.5%) events. Most HAEs required no dose modification (91.6%; patients continued 
to be dosed) and resolved (97.5%). In clinical trials, serum sickness was reported in 7 out of 285 (2%) 
patients. Three out of 7 (1%) patients had severe serum sickness.

Twenty-five events of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 16 patients. Acute 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions were managed by administration of adrenaline (44%; 
11/25 episodes), corticosteroids (56%; 14/25), antihistamines (56%; 14/25), and/or oxygen (8%; 
2/25 episodes). Four out of 16 (1%; 4/285) patients experienced a total of 5 episodes of acute systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions that were considered severe. Based on the immunogenicity profile, the 
underlying mechanism for acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions observed in clinical trials appears to 
be non-IgE mediated Type III (immune-complex mediated) hypersensitivity 
Most of the events occurred in the first year of treatment and were dose-independent. Additional analysis 
did not identify any risk factors for the occurrence of ASHRs including age, gender, baseline and pre-event 
phenylalanine, cumulative dose and time from last dose to event onset.  
The product information contains detailed warnings about the prevention and management of such 
events.  
Due to the potential for an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction, premedication prior to each dose is 
required during induction and titration (time prior to reaching blood phenylalanine levels less than 600 
micromol/l while on a stable dose). Patients should be  instructed to take premedication with an H1 
antagonist, H2 antagonist, and antipyretic. During maintenance, premedication should be considered for 
subsequent injections based on patient tolerability to pegvaliase. 
Prior to first dose of pegvaliase, the patient should be trained on the signs and symptoms of an acute 
systemic hypersensitivity reaction and to seek immediate medical care if a reaction occurs, and how to 
properly administer adrenaline injection device (auto injector or pre filled syringe/pen). 
Initial administration(s) should be performed under supervision of a healthcare professional and patients 
should be closely observed for at least 60 minutes following of each of these initial injections. Prior to 
independent self -injection, a healthcare professional should train the patient and their observer, and 
assess patient competency on proper self-administration of this medicinal product.  
For at least the first 6 months of treatment when the patient is self-injecting (i.e. when administration is 
not under healthcare professional supervision), an observer must be present during and for at least 60 
minutes after each administration. An observer is present with the patient during and after pegvaliase 
administration, is able to recognise the signs and symptoms of an acute systemic hypersensitivity 
reaction, call for emergency medical support and administer adrenaline, if warranted. After 6 months of 
pegvaliase treatment, the need for an observer may be reconsidered. 
An adrenaline injection device (auto-injector or pre-filled syringe/pen) should be prescribed to patients 
receiving this medicinal product. Patients should be instructed to carry adrenaline injection device with 
them at all times during pegvaliase treatment. Patients and the observer should be instructed to 
recognise the signs and symptoms of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, in the proper emergency 
use of the adrenaline injection device, and the requirement to seek immediate medical care. The risks 
associated with adrenaline use should also be considered when prescribing pegvaliase. 
Prior to independent self-injection, a healthcare professional should: 
• 
• 
train the patient and assess patient competency on proper self-administration of this medicinal 
product.  
train the observer to recognise signs and symptoms of an acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction 
and to seek immediate medical care if a reaction occurs, and how to properly administer adrenaline 
injection device (auto-injector or pre-filled syringe/pen) 
In addition, pegvaliase is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a severe systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction or recurrence of a mild to moderate acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction to

pegvaliase or another PEGylated medicinal product. For severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions or 
recurrence of a mild to moderate acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction, patients should seek 
immediate medical care and pegvaliase should be permanently discontinued. The prescribing physician 
should consider the risks and benefits of readministering the medicinal product following resolution of the 
first mild to moderate acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Upon readministration, the first dose 
must be administered with premedication under the supervision of a healthcare professional with the 
ability to manage acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions. Prescribing physician should continue or 
consider resuming use of premedication. 
Acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions, and angioedema as a symptom of such reactions are included 
in the RMP as important identified risks. Educational material for Health Care Professionals and patients 
will also be distributed by the applicant. This additional risk minimisation activity is aimed at educating the 
HCPs for appropriate measures to be considered in order to reduce the incidence and severity of acute 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions and also educate the patients and trained observers to recognise 
signs of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions so appropriate treatment can be initiated promptly, 
thus reducing the impact of the event. 
The applicant will also conduct a prospective global observational study (study 165-501) to further 
characterize the risk of hypersensitivity events including the ASHRs. Notably patients enrolled in study 
165-501 in case of an hypersensitivity reaction can be enrolled in substudy 165-503 for laboratory 
assessment. The primary objective of that study is to evaluate the immunologic and inflammatory 
responses (immunologic testing, inflammatory markers) associated with incidence of immune-mediated 
adverse reactions. 
In the clinical trials, two patients on long term use of a PEGylated medroxyprogesterone acetate product 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions following single doses of pegvaliase. Verhoef and colleagues have 
proposed that immune-mediated side-effects of PEGylated products is based on the haptogenic 
properties of PEG, responsible for complement activation and the induction of anti-PEG antibodies 
(Verhoef 2014). Because antibodies bind to the PEG portion of pegvaliase, there may be potential for 
binding with other PEGylated therapeutics and increased hypersensitivity to other PEGylated injectables. 
The impact of anti-PEG antibodies on the clinical effects of other PEG containing medicinal products is 
unknown. For this reason, acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking other concurrent 
injectables containing PEG is also included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
In the I/T/M Population, 125 (43.9%) patients met the definition of hypophenylalaninaemia (at least 2 
consecutive blood phenylalanine levels <30 μmol/L). In 80% of the cases, blood phenylalanine levels 
dropped below 5 umol/L (lower limit of detection). The median time to onset from the first dose to the first 
hypophenylalaninaemia event was 393 days (range 51 to 1,405 days) and the median duration of 
hypophenylalaninaemia events was 161 days (range 35 to 1,408 days).  
Measures were included in the protocol to prevent hypophenylalaninaemia (regular blood phenylalanine 
measurements, possibility for dose decrease and consultation of a dietician to increase protein intake). 
These measures have also been included in the SmPC in order to minimise this risk. Monitoring of blood 
phenylalanine level is recommended once a month. If a patient has a confirmed phenylalanine level below 
30 micromol/l, dietary protein intake should be increased to appropriate levels, and then, if needed, the 
dosage of Palynziq should be reduced. (see section 4.2). In patients experiencing hypophenylalaninaemia 
despite appropriate levels of protein intake, dose reductions are expected to be most effective in 
managing hypophenylalaninaemia. Patients who develop hypophenylalaninaemia should be monitored 
every 2 weeks until blood phenylalanine level is within a clinically acceptable range. Based on animal 
studies, hypophenylalaninaemia in pregnant women with PKU treated with pegvaliase may be associated 
with adverse foetal outcomes. Blood phenylalanine levels should be monitored more frequently prior to 
and during pregnancy.

Since phenylalanine is an essential amino acid, there is a concern about possible long term possible 
adverse consequence and for this reason hypophenylalaninaemia has been included in the RMP as an 
important Identified risk and will be further characterised with a planned observational study to evaluate 
the long term safety of subcutaneous injections pegvaliase in adults with PKU (Study 16-501).  
Persistent arthralgia (lasting at least 6 months) occurred in 19 (7%) patients with a total of 24 episodes. 
Persistent arthralgia is included in the RMP as an important identified risk as it may have a significant 
impact on the patient QOL. Additional pharmacovigilance activities (Studies PAL-003, 165-302, part 4 and 
165-501) will further characterise the risk of persistent arthralgia with respect to number of reports, 
seriousness, outcome, and risk factors and whether experience in the post marketing setting is consistent 
with the information already known for this risk from clinical trial data.  
93% of the patients experienced injection site reactions, and even though most of these reactions were 
not severe, it was acknowledged that with long term administration more severe reactions are possible. 
Severe injection site reactions may also have an impact on the patient QOL and are thus included in the 
RMP as an important identified risk which will be characterised in ongoing and planned studies. 
Appropriate warnings have been included in the product information to manage this risk. 
Patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment were not included in the clinical trials. Vacuoles 
were observed in chronic rat studies for pegvaliase, which may be consistent with the clearance of PEG 
over time. However, no associated kidney related toxicity was observed in the chronic toxicity rat studies 
with pegvaliase. Laboratory findings related also did not reveal any potential signals of significant renal 
toxicity. Patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment are included in the RMP as missing 
information and information will be collected through the planned observational study.  
Laboratory parameters were presented for the MD population. No safety concerns arose during the 
assessment of the laboratory findings.  
No separate analysis was done on ethnicity since studies predominantly enrolled Caucasian Americans 
who will be representative of European ancestry, and therefore share a similar diversity of PKU gene 
mutations. Although the study population might not be representative for European patients with i.e. 
Asian ancestry, no safety concerns are anticipated.  
Patients above 65 were not included in the studies and no conclusions can be drawn about the safety in 
elderly patients. The current data do not give rise to safety concerns in elderly patients.  Use in the elderly 
is included in the RMP. 
Immunogenicity assessment revealed that all patients develop ADA’s. All patients developed sustained 
antibodies against the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) protein, and the majority of patients 
developed transient antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG). Anti-PAL responses peaked around 3-6 
months and remained relatively stable through long term treatment (>1 year after pegvaliase initiation), 
indicative of a typical CD4-dependent antibody response induced against a foreign protein. Drug induced 
PEG IgM and PEG IgG responses peaked at 1-3 months after treatment initiation and then returned to 
baseline levels in most patients by 6-9 months of treatment suggestive of a CD4-independent antibody 
response typically induced against a repetitive, non-protein antigen. Neutralizing antibodies capable of 
inhibiting enzymatic activity of the PAL enzyme were detected in a majority of patients by approximately 
6 months and were generally sustained once detected. Of the 13 patients who experienced acute 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions, all tested negative for drug-specific IgE at or near the time of an 
event. Observed increases in CIC levels in conjunction with C3/C4 complement consumption and lack of 
IgE detection, suggests that the predominant mechanism of injectionshypersensitivity.  
In general, an association between ADA titers and frequency of hypersensitivity reactions and injection 
site reactions was observed for some antibody analytes, such that patients who had lower mean titers 
experienced fewer hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions. However, individual titers 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 95/110 
 
 
 
 
 
overlapped between patients who experienced anaphylaxis events and those who did not; as a result, no 
specific antibody titers could be identified as predictive of an HAE or anaphylactic event. For the patients 
with high CIC formation, the decrease in complement C3/C4 was sustained with prolonged treatment. 
Additional analysis provided by the applicant showed suppressed complement was not associated with an 
increase in adverse events, with the exception of lymphadenopathy which was associated with decreased 
C3 levels. Complications of immune complex formation resulting in end-organ damage is included in the 
RMP as an important potential risk and will be further characterised in the ongoing studies PAL-003, part 
4 of study 165-302and the planned immunogenicity/ inflammation lab study (165-503). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
A limited number of patients of 16-18 years were included in the studies. However, there seem to be no 
differences in the safety profile in the 16-18 years group and the 18-65 years group. The pegvaliase 
mechanism of action to correct the underlying metabolic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
gene is the same in both adults and adolescents (including 16 to <18 year olds). However, it is known that 
the innate and adaptive immune systems gradually mature over time. As the individual gets older, he or 
she develops an expanding repertoire comprising memory T and B cells triggered by previous infections 
and vaccinations, but also a naive-memory repertoire shaped by exposure to the microbiome, food 
antigens and inhaled antigens. For this reason, unpredictable immune-mediated response with off-label 
use in patients under 16 years of age have been included in the RMP as an important potential risk and will 
be addressed through the planned observational study (165-501). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity PKU, the safety profile of pegvaliase has 
been adequately characterised. The main safety concern identified is the risk of acute systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions. To mitigate this risk, detailed warnings have been included in the product 
information to prevent and manage such events if they occur. Additional risk minimisation measures are 
also planned to further alert healthcare professionals and patients about this risk, and occurrence of such 
events will be closely monitored in an observational study.  
The CHMP considers that the extensive risk minimisation measures that are in place is adequate to 
manage the risk of acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions and the other risks associated with the use 
of pegvaliase.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 24.05.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that pegvaliase has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers pegvaliase to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Palynziq (pegvaliase) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU;  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Palynziq is indicated for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) 16 years and older who 
have inadequate blood phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater than 600 µmol/L) 
despite prior management with available treatment options. 
PKU is an inherited, autosomal recessive, non-lethal disease characterized by a deficiency in the liver 
enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH catalyses the conversion of the essential amino acid 
phenylalanine to tyrosine, and this enzymatic activity is facilitated by tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). PAH 
deficiency results in abnormally elevated concentrations of phenylalanine, which is toxic to the brain. PKU 
in children and adults can be controlled by the reduction of blood phenylalanine levels. The recommended 
blood phenylalanine level in the EU guideline for the treatment of PKU is 120 -600 µmol/L for both children 
over 12 years and adults.  
There is also a high incidence of neurologic and psychiatric disorders (including intellectual disability, 
anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive dysfunction) in the adult PKU patient population. In addition, 
these patients  have impaired working memory, inhibitory control and social-cognitive functioning 
compared to healthy controls. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current management of PKU is based on restriction of dietary protein to reduce phenylalanine intake to 
levels that will allow maintenance of target phenylalanine levels and ingestion of phenylalanine-free 
protein supplements to maintain daily protein requirements. Patients may tolerate only a small fraction of 
the usual daily intake of protein and must meet >80% of daily protein requirements using 
phenylalanine-free protein supplements.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 103/110 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance of this degree of protein restriction is impractical in daily life, also considering that the 
phenylalanine-free protein supplement is known to be unpalatable. Poor compliance with diet 
management is a well-known occurrence in adults with PKU.  
If the patient cannot adhere to diet, sapropterin can be administered concomitantly. However, a large 
proportion (around 60% in Northern Europe and around 40% in Southern Europe) of (adult) PKU patients 
will not benefit from sapropterin treatment because sapropterin is effective in a limited number of 
patients only that have residual PAH activity. Sapropterin is available as a tablet or powder for oral 
solution and is usually taken once a day with food.  
There is currently an unmet medical need in adult patients with PKU who have uncontrolled blood 
phenylalanine levels (i.e. who failed to achieve guideline recommended blood phenylalanine control) with 
the combination of the currently available treatment sapropterin and phenylalanine-restricted diet.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
Two phase III studies (study 165-301 and 165-302) were submitted of which study 165-302 is considered 
as the main study, consisting of four parts. Part 1 was a 13 weeks run-in phase to reach and maintain a 
stable pegvaliase dose for those patients that were transitioned from the phase II studies 165-205 and 
PAL-003 or to further maintain the patients transitioned from study 165-301 on a stable dose; part 2 was 
a 8 weeks double blind placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal part; part 3 consisted of a six week PK 
period; and part 4 was an open label long term follow-up period up to 212 weeks including a titration 
based on phenylalanine levels randomized study in the clinical program, part 4 of this study investigates 
long term efficacy of pegvaliase.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Titration phase 
In general 95% of the patients reached their randomized dose in less than 23.9 weeks. A higher 
percentage of patients in the 40 mg/day randomized dose group compared to the 20 mg/day randomized 
dose group achieved blood phenylalanine reductions to <600 μmol/L; 46.9% versus 34.4%.  
Maintenance phase 
93.4% of the patients received their randomized dose level as their final dose. A further reduction of blood 
phenylalanine levels was observed after dose increases (maximal allowed dose was 60 mg/day); median 
change from baseline part 4 up to week 41 was -1109.0 µmol/l in the <20 mg/day (n=38),  
-1126.0 µmol/l in the 20 -<40 mg/day (n=112), -761 µmol/l in the 40-<60 mg/day (n=181) and  
-516.0 µmol/l in the ≥60 mg/day group. Overall, 65.3% of the patients reached a phenylalanine level 
≤600 μmol/L from baseline study 165-301 to week 41 in study 165-302 part 4. Thirty-one patients who 
were in the 40 mg/day group and did not achieve blood phenylalanine concentration <600 μmol/L, when 
titrated to 60 mg/day 24/31 patients reached the target threshold.  
Under continued pegvaliase treatment patients were capable in increasing their protein intake from intact 
food.  
Median changes (expressed in points) in ADHD Inattention Score mean from baseline part 4 to week 41 
for the difference dosing categories were -5.0 in the <20 mg/day (n=42), -3.0 in the ≥20 -<40 mg/day 
(n=130), -4.0 in the ≥40-<60 mg/day (n=185) and -5.5 in the ≥60 mg/day (n=69) group. 
 After 24 months of pegvaliase treatment these scores were -6.5 in the <20 mg/day (n=19), -6.0 in the 
≥20 -<40 mg/day (n=23), -6.3 in the ≥40-<60 mg/day (n=84) and -4.2 in the ≥60 mg/day (n=34) 
group when compared to baseline.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/181920/2019  
Page 104/110 
 
 
 
Additional analyses confirmed that under continued treatment the ADHD Inattention Score, PKU POMS 
TMD and POMS TMD (Self-Rated) exceeded the minimal important clinical difference. A greater 
magnitude of reduction was observed with long-term treatment in patients who had a baseline ADHD 
Inattention Subscale >9 at baseline.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Of the 261 PKU patients initially included in study 165-301, 190 patients enrolled in part 4 of study 
165-302. 27% of the patients discontinued due to AEs or other reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up) prior to 
enrolment in part 4. This discontinuation rate impacts the responder analysis of part 4 of study 165-302. 
The poolability testing of the placebo groups (20 mg/day and 40 mg/day) indicated a significant 
difference (p = 0.0424), suggesting that the placebo groups should not be pooled. However, as this 
pooling was pre-specified due to lower enrolment rates and individual comparisons did not show different 
results, pooled analyses were accepted but should be considered cautiously.  
In the open-label part 4 of study 165-302 data on neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms showed 
some, non-statistically significant improvement and too small to be clinically relevant in patients still on 
treatment, further the open-label design limits the robustness of the conclusion drawn. 
An increased intake of natural foods and phenylalanine, is only reported for patients still on treatment in 
the open-label phase of the study. Therefore, data should be interpreted cautiously.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Pegvaliase is administered in an induction/titration/maintenance regimen to enhance tolerability. The 
relevant population for safety assessment is the I/T/M population consisting of 285 patients.  
Drug related AEs occurred in 100% of patients. The most common drug-related AEs among patients were 
injection site reactions (93.3%), arthralgia (84.6%), hypersensitivity reactions (74.7%), headache 
(54.7% rash (38.9%), nausea (35.1%), pruritus (31.9%) and urticaria (30.5%).These adverse events 
are considered related to the hypersensitivity reactions observed in all patients. The incidence of HAEs in 
the placebo group was 14.3% versus 79.6% in the <20 mg/day group (highest incidence) and 41.7% in 
the ≥60 mg/day group (lowest incidence). 
A number of patients (5.6%) experienced acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions (ASHRs) which were 
time and dose-independent. 
Angioedema, not as part of an acute hypersensitivity reaction, was experienced in 21 patients (7.4%) in 
the I/T/M population. All events were grade 1 and 2 events. Serum sickness was reported in 7 patients 
(2.5%), of which 3 patients had grade 3 events. For 2 patients, the drug was withdrawn due to serum 
sickness (listed as SAEs), the remaining 5 events were managed with drug disruption, drug reduction or 
concomitant medication. All events of serum sickness resolved without sequelae.  
All patients developed ADAs against either pegvaliase (anti-pal) or PEG (anti-peg). In 70-80% of the 
patients, neutralizing antibodies (Nab, capable of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of pegvaliase) were 
detected. In general, hypersensitivity AEs and specifically acute systemic hypersensitivity reactions were 
most commonly seen in patients which had the highest antibody titres/CIC levels (29.6% in quartile 3+4 
versus 12.3 % in quartile 1+2), but individual titres were not predictive for the drug tolerability.  
Hypophenylalaninaemia, defined as when a patient who had at least 2 consecutive blood phenylalanine 
levels <30 μmol/L, occurred in 125 (43.9%) of patients in the I/T/M Population. The median duration was 
162 days. In 80% of the patients experiencing hypophenylalaninaemia, blood phenylalanine levels 
dropped below 5 µmol/L (lower limit of detection of the assay).

Page 105/110 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No risk factors could be identified for the occurrence of ASHRs. In 11 of the 25 events (44%) epinephrine 
was administered. Due to the occurrence of acute systemic hypersensitivity events early in the clinical 
study program, risk minimization measures were instated including the use of pre-medications during 
titration, a prolonged titration phase, the need to carry an epi-pen and the presence of a trained observer. 
This risk will be further characterised in the ongoing PAL-003 clinical study and the planned observational 
pegvaliase exposure study (165-501). 
The risks associated with hypophenylalaninaemia are poorly understood, hypophenylalaninaemia is 
included in the safety specifications and will be addressed in the proposed observational pegvaliase 
exposure study (study 165-501).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Under continued pegvaliase treatment, the majority of treated patients reached the target of 
phenylalanine level at week 41 (part 4 of study 165-302). In addition, in the randomised withdrawal 
phase (part 2) of study 165-302, it was demonstrated that in patients who were withdrawn from 
pegvaliase (e.g. randomised to placebo treatment) blood phenylalanine levels increased. When treatment 
was re-introduced (in part 3) blood phenylalanine levels decreased again under continued pegvaliase 
treatment up to 41 week in the long-term open label part of the study part (part 4). These findings clearly 
demonstrate, together with the observed reduction of blood phenylalanine in the other studies, the 
pharmacodynamic properties of pegvaliase. This effect is considered, clinically meaningful and beneficial.  
Data indicates that under continued long-term treatment the neuropsychiatric/ neurocognitive symptoms 
further improve. 
Patients with blood phenylalanine levels ≤600 μmol/L could increase their intake of dietary phenylalanine 
and proteins from intact food. Protein intake seemed to normalise towards protein intake for healthy 
subjects. Given the widely acknowledged unpalatability of medical grade food this is considered an 
additional benefit for the patient. 
No differences in efficacy and safety were observed in the 12 paediatric patients (16 to <18 years old) 
included in the clinical program compared to the patients >18 years old. 
In the clinical program patients were titrated based on tolerability to a fixed dose of pegvaliase (e.g., 20 
mg/day or 40 mg/day) and the study design only facilitated for further optimisation of the dose in the long 
term follow-up phases of the clinical program (patients could be titrated up to 60 mg/day or titrated down 
as far as to 5 mg/day to reach an optimal blood phenylalanine concentration).  In this context, it is 
anticipated that in clinical practice the patients with PKU are titrated to the most optimal dose to achieve 
blood phenylalanine levels between 120 and ≤600 µmol/L taking in account the patients’ tolerability to 
pegvaliase. The posology scheme is in line with anticipated clinical practice.  
Acute and clinically relevant systemic hypersensitivity reactions were observed in 5.6% of treated 
patients. These reactions were predominantly observed in the first year of treatment. Risk factors for the 
occurrence of ASHRs could not be identified. In a substantial proportion of patients (44%) presenting with 
ASHR treatment with epinephrine was needed. In the clinical study program risk minimization measures 
were instated to manage ASHRs. These measures were able to decrease the incidence and severity of 
hypersensitivity reactions and the associated discontinuations. These measures are reflected in the SmPC 
of pegvaliase, and additional educational material for prescribers and patients are intended to further 
minimise and prevent the occurrence of these events in clinical practice. 
Other risks associated with pegvaliase use, such as hypophenylaninaemia and occurrence of neutralising 
antibodies are considered to be adequately managed by routine risk minimisation measures. Further 
information on the incidence, severity and clinical consequences of such adverse reactions are expected 
through planned and ongoing studies which are described in the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical efficacy of pegvaliase in terms of a pharmacodynamic effect of pegvaliase has been 
convincingly demonstrated. For the overall benefit-risk assessment the effect of lowering blood

phenylalanine levels on dietary protein intake and neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric symptom scores is 
also important.  
The majority of the AE experienced were mild-moderate hypersensitivity adverse events. A part of the 
patients experiences serious adverse events of which the majority were serious acute systemic 
hypersensitivity events. AEs led to a substantial treatment discontinuation rate, especially in the early 
treatment phase.  
These events are expected to be managed by stringent risk minimization measures, including mandatory 
premedication, the presence of a trained observer and a more flexible titration phase, which in the clinical 
trials were shown to be effective in decreasing drug discontinuations and ASHRs/HAEs.  
However, in general the AEs were tolerated, manageable and resolved without sequelae. 
The long-term effect of treatment on safety in PKU patients will be further evaluated in the planned 
observational study. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Palynziq is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Palyzinq is not similar to Kuvan within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Palynziq is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 16 years and older who have inadequate blood 
phenylalanine control (blood phenylalanine levels greater than 600 micromol/l) despite prior 
management with available treatment options. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2) 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.

medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Palynziq in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Palynziq is marketed, all healthcare professionals 
and patients, carers and observers who are expected to prescribe, use or oversee the administration of

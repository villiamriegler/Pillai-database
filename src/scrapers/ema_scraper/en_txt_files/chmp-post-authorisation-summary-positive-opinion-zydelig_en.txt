On 25 February 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Zydelig. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences International 
Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication as follows2:  
“Zydelig is indicated in combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab or 
ofatumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): 
•  who have received at least one prior therapy, or 
• 
as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable 
for chemo-immunotherapy.” 
For information, the full indications for Zydelig will be as follows: 
“Zydelig is indicated in combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab or 
ofatumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL): 
•  who have received at least one prior therapy, or 
• 
as first line treatment in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable 
for chemo-immunotherapy. 
Zydelig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with follicular lymphoma 
(FL) that is refractory to two prior lines of treatment.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

Introduction 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Daptomycin  is  a  novel  cyclical  lipopeptide  derived  from  a  natural  product  of  Streptomyces 
roseosporus.  
Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections in adults at the 
recommended dose of 4 mg/kg administered as a single daily dose for 7-14 days or until the infection 
is resolved. 
Daptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only. In mixed infections where Gram negative 
and/or  certain  types  of  anaerobic  bacteria  are  suspected,  Cubicin  should  be  co-administered  with 
appropriate antibacterial agent(s). 
This Type II variation concerns the MAH’s proposal to extend the approved therapeutic indication to 
include  the  treatment  of  Staphylococcus  aureus  bacteraemia  (SAB),  including  known  or  suspected 
Infective Endocarditis (IE) in adults. 
The recommended daily dose for these indications (6 mg/kg once daily) is higher than that currently 
approved for the treatment of cSSTI (4 mg/kg once daily). 
The changes to the SPC include: 
Various modifications in 4.1, 4.2 and 5.2 to reflect the two possible doses by indication, an additional 
warning in 4.4, safety data in 4.8, description of the study in 5.1 and additions to 5.3 to support the 
higher dose. 
In support of this proposal, the MAH provided: 
• 
• 
a completed study report on DAP-IE-01-02 (Pivotal efficacy study). This is dated 17 August 
2005 and the study was actually conducted between 28 August 2002 and 16 February 2005. 
The study enrolled patients at 48 sites across the US, France, Belgium and Germany. 
a final report on a pharmacokinetic study (DAP-ADT-04-02: Phase 1 clinical trial) in healthy 
subjects  who  were  given  up  to  12  mg/kg  daptomycin  daily  for  two  weeks.  A  preliminary 
report was previously reviewed during the initial assessment of daptomycin since it provided 
information on metabolites and included an assessment of nerve conductivity. This final report 
is presented as supporting safety data for the 6 mg/kg dose used in DAP-IE-01-02.  
The application also includes: 
•  A non-clinical summary that addresses the data that would support the use of a 6 mg/kg dose 
in man where justified 
•  11  reports  or  articles  regarding  further  data  on  the  microbiological  studies  performed  or 
completed  since  the  previous  submission.  Effectively,  these  reports  encompass  the 
information provided almost simultaneously to address FUMs 003 (concerning mechanisms of 
resistance)  and  009  (concerning  investigations  on  S.  aureus  isolates    into  patients  and 
organisms that were the subject of daptomycin failures associated with increased MICs in the 
DAP-IE-01-02).  The  information  from  the  11  reports  in  Module 5  and  from  FUMs  003  and 
009 are summarised together in this assessment report.

Clinical aspects 
2.1 
Pharmacokinetics 
2.1.1  Supportive study – DAP-ADT-04-02 
2.1.1.1 Description 
This  was  a  single  centre,  randomised  and  double-blind  study  in  which  ascending  doses  (10  and 
12 mg/kg)  of  daptomycin  were  administered  for  14  days  to  two  cohorts  of  healthy  volunteers.  In 
addition,  a  third  cohort  was  randomised  (1:1)  to  receive  6  or  8  mg/kg  daptomycin  for  4  days  to 
establish a pharmacokinetic baseline for comparison. 
•  The primary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of 6, 8, 10, 
and 12 mg/kg/day. 
•  The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of once daily IV dosing at 10 
and 12 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days. 
Up to 36 healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age were to be sequentially enrolled into one 
of the 3 dosing cohorts. Attempts were to be made to enrol equal numbers of each gender.  
In Cohort 1, 12 subjects were to be randomised 3:1 to daptomycin 10 mg/kg or placebo (0.9% sodium 
chloride)  for  14  days.  Following  Cohort  1,  the  blinded  safety  data  were  to  be  transferred  to  the 
Sponsor  for  clinical  evaluation  and  then  discussed  in  a  teleconference  between  the  Principal 
Investigator and the Sponsor to reach a decision of whether to proceed to 12 mg/kg/day.  
Thus, Cohort 2 subjects were to be randomised 3:1 to daptomycin 12 mg/kg or placebo for 14 days. 
In  Cohort  3,  12  subjects  were  to  be  randomised  1:1  to  receive  6  mg/kg  or  8  mg/kg  once  daily  for 
4 days.

2.1.1.2 Results  
All  except  one  subject  completed  the  study  dosing  and  follow-up  periods  (the  subject  was  in  the 
placebo group of Cohort 2 and withdrew on his own volition. 
As  shown  in  the  next  table,  based  on  data  after  the  first  dose,  exposure  to  daptomycin  (Cmax  and  
AUC0-∞) increased with dose with Cmax occurring at the end of the infusion (0.5 h) at all dose levels. 
Half-life ranged from 7.3 to 8.3 h.

Daptomycin  was  highly  bound  to  plasma  protein  and  the  protein  binding  was  independent  of  drug 
concentration. The level of plasma protein binding of daptomycin on Day 1 was consistent across dose 
levels with the unbound fraction (fu) mean values of 0.07 – 0.10. 
Daptomycin was excreted mainly in the urine with 37-68% (mean %Fe across all doses and days) of 
the  administered  dose  being  excreted  in  24  h  as  unchanged  drug.  As  a  consequence  of  high  plasma 
protein  binding  and  major  excretion  by  the  kidneys,  the  level  of  CLwp  was  relatively  low  (9.9-
10.1 ml/h/kg) and the t1/2 was long (7.3-8.3 h) across the dose groups. Daptomycin had a small Vd 
(0.1 l/kg) suggesting that the drug remains primarily in the plasma and interstitial fluid. 
Repeat daily dosing at all levels resulted in attainment of steady-state conditions by Day 3. The MAH 
has presented mean PK parameters at steady-state (Day 4) and at Day 14. At steady-state, exposure to 
daptomycin  (Cmax  and  AUC)  increased  with  dose  with  Cmax  occurring  at  the  end  of  the  infusion 
(0.5 h) at all dose levels. Again CLwp was relatively low (8.8-9.1 ml/h/kg), the t1/2 was long (7.7-8.3 
h) across the dose groups and the Vd was small (0.1 l/kg).  
The Cmax and AUC were slightly higher at steady-state (Day 4) than following a single dose for the 8, 
10 and 12 mg/kg doses levels of daptomycin. This accumulation was not observed at the 6 mg/kg dose 
due to very high concentrations on Day 1 for one subject (Cmax = 155 µg/ml). Cmax on Day 14 was 
similar to that observed at steady-state.

The  MAH  has  performed  the  analysis  of  dose  proportionality  of  AUC0-∞  on  Day  1,  AUC0-tau  on 
Day 4, Cmax on Days 1 and 4 and Cmin on Day 4 (with natural log transformation prior to analysis). 
Based  on  the  result  of  the  90%  CI  of  the  slope  estimate,  the  mean  AUCs  and  Cmin  of  daptomycin 
were shown to be dose proportional (i.e. included the value of 1.0) while mean Cmax did not meet the 
dose proportionality criteria. 
On both Days 1 and 4 the increase in Cmax with dose was slightly less than dose proportional. The 
mean  Cmax  on  Day  1  in  the  6  mg/kg  dose  group  is  inflated  by  the  subject  with  an  unusually  high 
Cmax (155 µg/ml) at that time. The lack of dose proportionality and lack of accumulation for Cmax 
was  less  obvious  when  the  median  value  for  the  6  mg/kg  dose  group  was  used  for  comparison  on 
Day 1. 
The pharmacokinetic conclusions of the study are as follows: 
o  Maximum  plasma  concentrations  were  reached  at  the  end  of  the  daptomycin  infusion  (0.5 
hours) in all dose groups 
o  The plasma concentration of daptomycin was slowly eliminated with mean half-lives ranging 
from 7.29-8.32 hours across the dosing range. 
o  Plasma  protein  binding  of  daptomycin  was  high  across  all  the  dose  levels  on  Day  1  with  a 
mean free drug fraction <0.10. Consistent with this, the mean Vd on Day 1 was approximately 
0.1 l/kg. 
o  Following intravenous infusion, daptomycin was excreted in the urine, with 37-68% (%Fe) of 
the administered dose being excreted in 24 h as unchanged drug. Glomerular filtration was the 
major elimination route for daptomycin. 
o  The steady-state of daptomycin was reached following 3-day repeat doses in all cohorts. 
o  The  mean  AUCs  and  Cmin  of  daptomycin  were  dose  proportional  over  the  range  of  6  to 
12 mg/kg; however, the mean Cmax did not meet the dose proportionality requirement as the 
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR 
4/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
90% confidence interval did not encompass 1 (upper bound was 0.973 and 0.964 on Day 1 and 
4, respectively). 
o  T  ½  and  CLwp  at  steady-state  were  similar  across  dose  levels  indicating  linear 
pharmacokinetics. 
These observations were generally consistent with those reported  in the initial  assessment report for 
daptomycin over the range of doses evaluated. The MAH had previously concluded that daptomycin 
pharmacokinetics  were  nearly  linear  and  time  independent  at  doses  up  to  6  mg/kg.  Daptomycin 
4 mg/kg administered once daily for 7 days achieved steady state concentrations by the third dose.  
The  safety  data  from  this  study  do  not  raise  any  new  issues  for  daptomycin.  With  such  small 
denominators per dose group it is not really possible to interpret the small differences in AEs although 
it remains possible that headache may increase with dose. 
The PK results were reflected in section 5.2 of the SPC. 
2.2 
Clinical efficacy 
2.2.1  Main study - DAP-IE-01-02 
2.2.1.1 Choice of dose 
This application is supported by a single study of efficacy in which daptomycin was administered at 
6 mg/kg once daily for the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia and endocarditis. This dose was based 
upon  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacodynamic  modelling,  animal  models  of  endocarditis,  animal 
toxicology and clinical data from earlier studies. 
o  Previous  PK/PD  studies  established  that  for  daptomycin  Cmax,  Cmax/MIC  and/or  AUC/MIC 
ratios are most closely correlated with in vivo efficacy.  
o  A series of in vitro simulations for treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia and simulated endocarditis 
vegetations  were  performed  using  biochambers  and  infusion  pumps  to  imitate  the  human  PK 
profiles  of  different  dose  regimens.  Based  on  simulated  data,  it  appeared  that  6  mg/kg/day 
produced greater than a 6 log reduction in MRSA and glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA) 
in endocarditis.  
o  A rat model of endocarditis demonstrated that daptomycin at a dose that provided exposures (Cmax 
and  AUC  values)  consistent  with  ≤  6  mg/kg/day  in  humans  produced  significant  bactericidal 
activity  against  S.  aureus.  Two  additional  models  of  S.  aureus  endocarditis  in  rabbits  also 
demonstrated a high degree of efficacy with daptomycin exposures consistent with a daily dose of 
≤  6  mg/kg/day  in  humans.  Moreover,  the  serum  concentrations  produced  by  the  6  mg/kg  human 
equivalent dose were consistently greater than the MIC99 of S. aureus. 
o  Pharmacodynamic  studies  in  mice  supported  the  importance  of  achieving  and  maintaining 
bactericidal concentrations of daptomycin and AUC and Cmax were both shown to be important. 
In the mouse pharmacodynamic models, the efficacy of daptomycin was not increased by dividing 
the daily dose (dose fractionation). As already recognised in the initial assessment of daptomycin, 
animal  toxicology  studies  and  data  in  man  indicated  that  dose  fractionation  increased  muscle 
toxicity. 
o  The  non-clinical  safety  profile  of  daptomycin  supported  both  the  safety  margin  and  duration  of 
dosing  for  6  mg/kg  q24h  for  treatment  of  S.  aureus  bacteraemia.  No  fibrosis  or  rhabdomyolysis 
was observed in repeat dose studies up to 150 mg/kg/day in rats and 100 mg/kg/day in dogs, which 
gave  daily  AUCs  approximately  10-  and  6-fold,  respectively,  the  predicted  human  AUC  with 
6 mg/kg  once  daily  dosing.  The  degree  of  serum  muscle  enzyme  elevations  and  microscopic 
myopathy  was  not  increased  when  treatment  once  daily  was  extended  from  1  to  6  months, 
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR 
5/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suggesting  that  toxicity  was  not  cumulative.  Complete  reversibility  of  the  muscle  lesions  was 
observed within 30 days after cessation of dosing. Non-clinical data relevant to the 6 mg/kg dose 
support the use of this dose in man. 
o  In Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects daptomycin was well tolerated at doses up to 8 mg/kg once 
daily for 14 days (CSR DAP-00-02).  
o  Two early clinical studies showed that a free daptomycin Cmax value approximately 15 x MIC90 
and C6h value approximately 4 to 16 x MIC90 of S. aureus could be reached with 6 mg/kg once 
daily in patients with serious S. aureus infections.  
o  Later studies (9803 and 9804) evaluated 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg once daily and 3 mg/kg twice daily 
for treating bacteraemia and a variety of infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. These data were 
described previously and their interpretation is hampered by the small numbers and heterogeneity 
of infections treated. However, in 9803, the efficacy of daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was similar 
to  that  of  the  comparators  in  patients  with  bacteraemia  due  to  Gram-positive  pathogens  while 
3 mg/kg twice daily seemed to be less effective. Conversely, there was a lower success rate among 
patients given 6 mg/kg once daily. A review suggested that other confounding clinical factors in the 
latter group, including delayed surgical drainage and removal of foreign bodies) had had an adverse 
effect  on  outcomes.  In  9804,  a  loading  dose  was  used  and  then  doses  were  adjusted  for  renal 
impairment.  The  3 mg/kg  twice  daily  regimen  and  lower  and  less  frequent  dosing  in  the  dialysis 
group seemed to result in lower efficacy.  
o  Therefore, 6 mg/kg once daily was chosen for study DAP-IE-01-02 with the provision that a Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB=DMC below) would evaluate available safety and efficacy data 
after the first 30 patients were enrolled. 
2.2.1.2 Description  
Methods 
This  was  a  multi-centre,  randomised  (1:1),  open-label  study  that  compared  daptomycin  with 
conventional  intravenous  therapy  [either  a  semi-synthetic  penicillin  –  one  of  nafcillin,  oxacillin, 
cloxacillin or flucloxacillin – or vancomycin] in patients with IE or bacteraemia due to S. aureus. 
•  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  daptomycin  is  not  inferior  to  comparator  in  the 
treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia and IE. The assessment was to be based on outcomes assigned by 
the Independent External Adjudication Committee (IEAC; see below) outcome at Test of Cure (TOC) 
in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population. 
The secondary objectives were:  
o  To compare clinical success rates between daptomycin and comparator in the treatment of S. 
aureus bacteraemia and IE: 
• at End of Treatment (EOT) in the ITT population 
• at EOT and TOC in the Per Protocol (PP) population 
• at EOT for each of the diagnoses defined by the IEAC in the ITT population 
• at EOT for each of the diagnoses defined by the Investigator in the ITT population 
o  To compare microbiological eradication rates between daptomycin and comparator 
o  To  demonstrate  similar  survival  rates  between  daptomycin  and  comparator  in  the  ITT 
population 
o  To evaluate the safety of daptomycin as compared to comparator in the safety population 
o  To assess the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin.

•  Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria and assignment of diagnosis 
Adults  (≥18  years)  were  to  have  documented  S.  aureus  bacteraemia  defined  as  at  least  one  positive 
blood culture obtained within 2 calendar days prior to the first dose of study medication. 
The  IEAC  assigned  the  diagnoses  at  baseline  and  EOT  and  the  following  definitions  for  the 
diagnostics  at  baseline:  definite/possible/not  IE  and  at  End  of  Therapy  (EOT): 
left  IE, 
complicated/uncomplicated RIE and complicated/uncomplicated bacteraemia. 
The exclusion criteria were clearly defined and included: 
o  Weighed >150 kg or <50 kg. 
o  Intravascular foreign material at the time a positive blood culture was drawn (e.g. intracardiac 
pacemaker  wires,  percutaneous  or  implanted  venous  catheters,  vascular  grafts)  unless  the 
Investigator intended to have the material removed within 4 days after the first dose of study 
medication. The only exceptions were for vascular stents that had been in place >6 months or 
permanent pacemakers attached via epicardial leads. 
o  Prosthetic heart valve. 
o  Cardiac  decompensation  and/or  valve  damage  such  that  there  was  a  high  likelihood  of 
requiring valve replacement surgery in the 3 days after randomisation. 
o  Infected  with  a  pathogen  with  confirmed  reduced  susceptibility  to  vancomycin  (MIC  >4 
µg/ml). 
o  Creatinine  clearance  (CLcr)  <  30  ml/minute  (calculated  using  the  Cockcroft-Gault  equation 
using actual body weight). 
o  ALT  or  AST  >5  ×  ULN,  total  bilirubin  ≥3.0  mg/dl,  CD4  lymphocytes  <0.200×103/µl, 
absolute neutrophil count <0.500×103/µl or anticipated to develop severe neutropenia during 
the study treatment period due to prior or planned chemotherapy. 
o  Known to have pneumonia, osteomyelitis or a polymicrobial blood infection. 
•  Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomised  to  daptomycin  or  conventional  therapy  based  on  a  centralised  computer-
generated randomisation schedule designed to achieve a 1:1 ratio of patients, stratified by investigative 
site.  
•  Treatments 
Daptomycin was administered at 6 mg/kg every 24 hours as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes 
in  0.9%  sodium  chloride.  The  actual  dose  could  be  adjusted  on  a  weekly  basis  if  there  was  a 
fluctuation of >5% in the patient’s weight. 
Comparative therapy 
Patients were to receive vancomycin or SSP (nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin).  
Vancomycin was  to  be  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion  over  60  minutes  every  12 hours  but 
dosing  was  to  be  adjusted  based  on  renal  function and  plasma  levels  according  to  the  Investigator’s 
standard practice and local hospital guidelines. 
SSPs  were  to  be  given  2  g  every  4  h  and  were  administered  as  an  intravenous  infusion  over 
15 minutes. 
Gentamicin 
All  patients  randomised  to  conventional  treatment  and  patients  with  LIE  randomised  to  daptomycin 
were to receive synergistic gentamicin for the first 4 days (or until blood cultures had been negative 
for 48 hours). Patients with uncomplicated RIE due to MSSA were to receive gentamicin for the entire 
14-day  course  if  short  course  therapy  was  deemed  appropriate  by  the  principal  investigator/treating 
physicians.  Gentamicin  (1  mg/kg  actual  body  weight)  was  to  be  administered  as  an  intravenous 
infusion  over  30  minutes  every  8  hours  and  dosing  was  to  be  adjusted  based  on  renal  function 
according  to  the  Investigator’s  standard  practice  and  manufacturer’s  guidelines.  Loading  doses  of 
gentamicin were allowed.

Other antibacterial agents 
Potentially  effective  non-study  anti-staphylococcal  antibacterial  agents  (e.g.  rifampicin)  were 
prohibited  from  the  time  of  enrolment  to  completion  of  follow-up  unless  required  to  treat  failures. 
Patients  requiring  treatment  for  an  intercurrent  infection  may  have  received  aztreonam  for  Gram-
negative organisms or metronidazole for anaerobic organisms or both. 
Duration of treatment  
This was to be based on the diagnosis as determined by the Investigator and the susceptibility of the 
S. aureus isolate.  
•  Sample size 
The original sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 
• 80% success rate for patients with IE given comparator therapy. 
• 80% success rate for patients with IE given daptomycin. 
• Significance level of 0.025 (one-sided) to test the null hypothesis that the treatments differed by at 
least 20%. 
Under these efficacy assumptions, the original protocol called for a sample size of 63 RIE patients in 
each  treatment  group  with  80%  power.  As  part  of  the  original  sample  size  determination,  it  was 
anticipated that a target ITT population of 420 patients would be required to achieve these 126 RIE 
patients. 
The protocol was amended in April 2004 to revise the sample size calculation based on the pooled ITT 
population rather than the RIE subset. In addition, the Sponsor noted that recent reports indicated that 
with increasing MRSA rates clinical success rates were expected to be approximately 65% in both test 
and reference populations. Thus, based on the same  assumptions for alpha (0.025, one-sided) power 
(80%),  and  delta  (20%),  and  assuming  65%  efficacy  in  both  treatment  groups,  a  sample  size  of  90 
patients (minimum) per treatment group would be required for the overall ITT (all diagnosis groups 
pooled) population. 
3.2.2.1.3 Results 
Of  the  246  patients  randomised  into  the  study  236,  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug  (120

Patient demographics were generally similar between groups.  
Proportions  with  certain  risk  factors  and  other  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  between  groups 
except that higher percentages in the daptomycin group had prior surgery within 30 days of onset of 
the S. aureus bacteraemia, pre-existing heart valve disease and positive HIV status.

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) was present in about 75% and over one-third per 
group  had  diabetes  with  ~80%  of  these  patients  requiring  insulin.  It  is  notable  that  extravascular 
foreign material, primarily orthopaedic prostheses, was present in 23.3% and 25.2% per group while 
permanent  intravascular  devices  were  present  in  11.7%  and  15.7%  per  group.  Also,  about  75%  had 
intravascular catheters present at the time of the first positive blood culture (peripheral venous access 
catheter in ~78% and central catheters in 19.6% and 18.7%). Infection within 30 days (mostly in the 
skin structure, catheter placement sites and urinary tract) were reported in 73.3% and 74.8% per group 
and any surgery within 30 days of onset was reported in 40.8% and 31.3%.  
Similar results for IEAC Entry and Final diagnostic subgroups were noted in the PP population. 
Based on the primary analysis and the MAH’s pre-set criteria for non-inferiority, daptomycin was as 
effective as conventional therapy in the treatment of patients with S. aureus bacteraemia with known 
or  suspected  endocarditis.  That  is,  in  both  populations,  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  around  the 
difference in success rates was within the pre-specified delta of -20% for the overall pooled analysis 
(with and without the continuity correction) and when the results were adjusted for IEAC Entry and 
Final diagnostic subgroups. In fact, the lower bound of the CIs did not exceed -16.1%.

The  35  patients  with  a  Final  IEAC  diagnosis  of  RIE  appeared  to  have  had  adequate  evidence  to 
support this classification. Among these 35 patients 7 patients (20%) experienced possible pneumonia 
and 2/4 treated with daptomycin compared to 1/3 treated with other therapy also had septic pulmonary 
emboli present at baseline. In 5 of these 7 patients, including all 4 in the daptomycin group and 1 in 
the  comparator  group,  no  additional  antibacterial  therapy  was  administered  for  the  possible

pneumonia. Two of the 4 daptomycin-treated patients and 1 of the 3 comparator-treated patients were 
reported as successes for the treatment of SAB/IE at TOC by the IEAC.  
For  those  patients  with  IEAC  Final  diagnoses  of  either  complicated  or  uncomplicated  bacteraemia 
success rates were at least as high for daptomycin as for comparative therapy and the lower 95% CI 
were all within -25%. 
With only 18 patients (9 per treatment group) with an IEAC Final diagnosis of LIE the small number 
of patients and few positive outcomes means that use cannot be supported. 
At  CHMP’s  request  a  retrospective  analysis  was  conducted  in  which  patients  were  categorised 
according  to  any  identifiable  baseline  foci  of  infection  (i.e.  microbiologically  confirmed  sites  of  S. 
aureus  infection  at  study  entry).  This  review  showed  that  150/235  (63.8%)  patients  [78/120  (65%) 
daptomycin;  72/115  (62.2%)  comparator]  had  bacteraemia  with  no  documented  foci  of  infection  at 
baseline. However, the IEAC Final diagnoses for the 150 patients identified retrospectively as having 
no identifiable focus of infection at baseline were: 
•  Bacteraemia  (total  complicated  or  uncomplicated)  in  109  patients  (58  daptomycin  and  51 
comparative therapy) 
(cid:190) Complicated  bacteraemia  was  the  IEAC  Final  diagnosis  in  75/109  patients  -  39  daptomycin 
and 36 in the comparative group 
(cid:190) Uncomplicated  bacteraemia  was  the  IEAC  Final  diagnosis  in  34/109  patients  -  19  and  15 
patients in respective treatment groups  
• 
IT (RIE or LIE) in 41 patients (20 daptomycin and 21 comparative therapy); of these 13 had LIE, 
20 had cRIE and 8 had uRIE with similar distributions between treatment groups.  
Thus, it can be deduced from these listings that: 
(cid:190) 116/150  patients  with  no  identifiable  focus  of  infection  at  baseline  based  on  this  retrospective 
review went on to have a focus of infection identified after initiation of therapy (IE or cBAC) 
(cid:190) 34/150 did not have a focus of infection discovered after initiation of therapy and had an IEAC 
Final diagnosis of uBAC.  
(cid:190) 34/61  ITT  patients  with  a  Final  diagnosis  of  uBAC  had  no  identifiable  focus  of  infection  at 
baseline  but  this  means  that  the  other  27  uBAC  patients  must  have  had  a  focus  of  infection 
identified at baseline. 
The  success  rates  at  TOC  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  as  shown  below.  In  particular, 
patients with bacteraemia only at baseline had similar success rates whether treated with daptomycin 
(34/78; 43.6%) or comparator (31/72; 43.1%) [∆ 0.5%, 95% CI: -15.3%, 16.4%].

Baseline focus of infection groups were used to evaluate outcomes in the 182 patients (77.4% of the 
total 235 enrolled; 92 in the daptomycin group and 90 in the comparative therapy group) who had an 
IEAC Final diagnosis of bacteraemia (uBAC [61] or cBAC [121]). The distribution by baseline focus 
of infection varied slightly between the treatment groups, mainly for SSTI/wound foci. 
Patients  who  were  in  the  bacteraemia  only  category  at  baseline  and  had  a  final  IEAC  diagnosis  of 
uBAC or cBAC had generally similar success rates whether they were treated with daptomycin (27/58; 
46.6%) or with comparative therapy (24/51; 47.1%) [∆ -0.5%, 95% CI: -19.3%, 18.3%].

The next table shows IEAC outcomes at TOC for ITT patients with bacteraemia only at baseline based 
on the retrospective review and with an IEAC Final diagnosis of cBAC or uBAC. Denominators are 
small but the table suggests slightly higher success with daptomycin in the subset finally classified as 
cBAC and the opposite for those with uBAC.

The antibacterial activity of daptomycin would not be affected by expression of methicillin resistance 
in staphylococci. However, due to the expected complexity of patients with MRSA rather than MSSA 
it might be expected that success rates would be lower in the former subgroup. However, the overall 
success  rates  with  daptomycin  in  the  ITT  population  were  actually  identical  in  patients  with  MSSA 
(44.6%)  or  MRSA  (44.4%).  In  contrast,  the  success  rates  in  the  comparator  group  were  48.6%  for 
patients with MSSA and 31.8% for patients with MRSA.  
Treatment  group  was  not  a  significant  factor  for  IEAC  outcome  at  TOC  in  any  of  the  logistic 
regression  analyses.  Increased  age,  persistent  fever  at  72  hours  and  decreased  creatinine  clearance 
were associated with poorer outcome in the ITT population. 
In  the  overall  PP  population,  baseline  creatinine  clearance  and  IEAC  Final  diagnostic  subgroup 
(uncomplicated bacteraemia) were significant factors. 
In a sensitivity analysis, the overall IEAC outcomes at TOC were analysed excluding the 18 patients 
with  LIE  the  success  rates  were  46.8%  and  43.4%  in  the  daptomycin  and  comparator  groups, 
respectively, with a lower 95% CI within -20%. Also, after excluding 26 patients (14 daptomycin and 
12  comparator  group)  with  TOC  evaluations  conducted  outside  of  the  protocol-defined  visit  the 
success rates were 49.2% and 50.0%, respectively, and the lower 95% CI was within -20%. 
IEAC outcomes at EOT evaluation show that daptomycin was as effective as conventional therapy in 
the  treatment  of  patients  with  S.  aureus  bacteraemia,  including  those  with  known  or  suspected 
endocarditis.

Pathogen eradication rates at TOC were mainly based on the 1215 isolates that were received by the 
Central Laboratory yielding a S. aureus recovery rate of 83.3%. All Baseline Infecting Pathogens that 
were  methicillin-resistant  were  mecA  positive.  Pathogen  eradication  rates  at  TOC  for  all  S.  aureus 
show  that  daptomycin  appeared  to  be  similarly  effective  at  eradicating  S.  aureus  from  the  blood  as 
conventional therapy with eradication rates at TOC of 52.1% in the daptomycin group and 50.0% in 
the  comparator  group.  For  patients  with  infections  caused  by  MRSA,  the  eradication  rate  in  the 
daptomycin group was 51.1% compared to 37.2% for vancomycin. 
In  the  PP  population  at  TOC,  S.  aureus  eradication  rates  overall  were  65.8%  for  daptomycin  and 
61.7% in the comparator group. For MSSA eradication rates were 68.9% and 69.0% and for MRSA 
eradication rates were 61.8% and 44.4% in respective groups. 
For those patients with an IEAC Entry diagnosis of definite or possible IE, S. aureus eradication rates 
were  53.3%  and  47.3%  in  the  daptomycin  and  comparator  groups,  respectively,  as  shown  below. 
Eradication rates for patients who were judged by the IEAC not to have IE at study entry were 48.3% 
in the daptomycin group and 60.9% in the comparator group, which reflects a lower eradication rate in 
the daptomycin group for patients with MSSA (45.0%) relative to the comparator group (64.7%). 
S. aureus eradication rates at EOT for the ITT population were 77.3% and 74.6% in the daptomycin 
and comparator groups, respectively, compared to 83.5% and 90.0% for the PP population. All IEAC 
microbiological failures due to persistent or relapsing S. aureus bacteraemia at EOT had documented 
positive blood cultures. One patient who was an IEAC success at EOT had a persistent S. aureus with 
a positive blood culture on Day 3 post-therapy so was assessed as a microbiological failure at TOC. 
A review of S. aureus susceptibility data over time showed that 8 patients had S. aureus isolates that 
demonstrated increasing daptomycin MICs on study. Of these, 7 had received daptomycin and one had 
received  vancomycin.  As  shown  in  the  table  below  IEAC  Final  diagnoses  among  the  7  treated  with 
daptomycin were  complicated  bacteraemia  in  four, LIE  in  two  and  complicated  RIE  in  one.  Five  of 
these seven had MRSA and the other two had MSSA. Cmax daptomycin was below the median for the 
population  as  a  whole  in  3/7  and  above  the  median  in  the  remaining  four  and  similar  results  were 
noted for AUC. 
Six of the 7 daptomycin-treated patients infected with organisms that showed increasing MICs were 
considered failures at TOC due to persisting or relapsing bacteraemia.  
The  next  table  shows  the  PK  data  from  these  patients,  which  are  considered  to  be  within  the  range 
seen for other patients who were clinical successes.

The seven isolates with elevated daptomycin MICs and their respective daptomycin-susceptible parent 
isolate were also tested in the neutropenic mouse thigh model. Drug exposures required to attain a 3 
log10  reduction  in  bacterial  CFU  in  the  non-susceptible  isolates  were  generally  higher  than  for  the 
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR 
14/29 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
parental  isolates.  However,  in  all  cases  the  AUC  achieved  in  each  patient  exceeded  the  exposure 
predicted to provide adequate treatment from the neutropenic mouse test. 
When  the  AUC/MIC  ratio  for  each  individual  isolate  in  the  mouse  thigh  model  was  compared  with 
those  calculated  from  patient  AUC  data  the  AUC/MIC  ratio  in  the  seven  patients  was,  in  all  cases, 
higher  than  that  in  the  mouse  model  indicating  that  drug  exposure  should  have  been  adequate  for 
treating baseline and non-susceptible isolates. 
Therefore, the microbiological investigations did not reveal an explanation for PRSA in these patients. 
The one unifying feature of these patients was the lack of adjunctive care for deep-seated infections. 
Reasons for Treatment Failure 
The IEAC reported that 134 ITT patients were failures or non-evaluable (67/120 [55.8%] daptomycin 
and  67/115  [58.3%]  in  the  comparator  group).  The  IEAC  reasons  for  each  failure  or  non-evaluable 
case  showed  no  differences  between  treatment  groups  for  proportions  that  received  non-study 
antibacterial agents that may have influenced outcome (16.7% and 13.9%) or in the number of deaths 
(10.8% and 11.3%). Patients in the daptomycin group were more likely to be reported by the IEAC as 
failures at TOC due to persisting or relapsing bacteraemia (15.0% compared to 8.7%) while failures in 
the  comparator  group  were  more  likely  to  reflect  premature  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  (6.7%  and 
14.8%). 
18  (15.0%)  daptomycin  and  10  (8.7%)  comparator  group  patients  were  assessed  as  microbiological 
failures  by  the  IEAC  due  to  persisting  or  relapsing  bacteraemia  and  one  additional  patient  in  each 
treatment group was considered to have failed due to a positive culture for S. aureus from a non-blood 
source (e.g. abscess). Thus, 30 patients (19 +11 per group) were reviewed as microbiological failures. 
The  19  daptomycin  patients  include  the  six  with  pathogens  that  showed  reduced  susceptibility  to 
daptomycin during treatment. 
There  were  21  (17.5%)  and  14  (12.2%)  patients  in  respective  groups  who  were  considered  to  be 
clinical  failures  by  the  IEAC  and  17  and  10  of  these  were  also  determined  to  be  microbiological 
failures. 
In fact, there were no major differences in characteristics that might explain the overall difference in 
failure rates between treatments. While a higher proportion in the daptomycin group had complicated 
bacteraemia,  the  previous  analyses  did  not  show  a  disadvantage  for  daptomycin  in  this  diagnostic 
subgroup. 
Outcomes by other patient characteristics 
While daptomycin appeared to be more successful in males than females at the same time there was no 
notable  disadvantage  for  daptomycin  in  treating  females  as  far  as  the  denominators  allow  for 
interpretation.  Regarding  age,  the  numbers  in  the  ≥  75  years  group  are  too  small  for  any  reliable 
interpretation of the apparent difference between treatments. Regarding renal function, again numbers 
with lower creatinine clearance values are small but there does seem to be trend for daptomycin to be 
less  effective  as  CrCl  declines.  As  previously  mentioned  the  summary  of  the  logistic  regression 
analysis  shows  that  all  final  models  include  age  or  creatinine  clearance  but  not  both,  giving  the 
impression  that  the  age  effect  is  probably  mediated  through  renal  clearance.  However,  in  this  study 
dose adjustment would not have been instituted except for persons with CrCl < 30 ml/min as per the 
US  package  insert  and  so  a  potential  under-dosing  due  to  unnecessary  dose  adjustment  is  not  the 
explanation.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  further  explore  this  observation.  Therefore,  the  MAH  has 
present data on the association between age and creatinine clearance in this study by cross tabulations 
and/or scatter plots. In the logistic regression analysis treatment group was not a significant factor for 
IEAC outcome at TOC. Increased age, persistent fever at 72 hours and decreased creatinine clearance 
were associated with poorer outcomes in the ITT population. The answer to this request indicates that 
the negative effects of age and CrCl on outcomes cannot be distinguished.

Pharmacokinetic data and PK/PD evaluations 
A review of DAP-IE-01-02 indicated that the previous PK/PD model that was derived for the purposes 
of  the  initial  application  for  licensure  of  daptomycin  was  applicable  to  this  population.  Exposure  to 
daptomycin in patients with IE or bacteraemia as assessed by AUC was lower than in healthy subjects 
at the same dose at steady-state. In patients with infections, the Vss (l/kg) was markedly increased and 
the  total  CL (ml/hr/kg)  higher  but  Cmax,  T1/2  and  trough  (C24,ss)  values  were  generally similar  to 
those in healthy subjects given the same dose. 
In the population analysis conducted to determine PK parameters at steady-state in 108 patients with 
SABIE and treated with 6 mg/kg q24h the results were stratified by varying degrees of renal function.

•  On comparing with the population PK analysis in the initial dossier (i.e. based on 4 mg/kg in 
cSSTI patients) plasma clearance (CLT), elimination half-life (t1/2), and volume of distribution 
(Vss) were similar in patients with cSSTI compared to those with SABIE.  
•  Plasma clearance (CLT) decreased with decreasing renal function. 
•  Exposure  to  daptomycin  (AUCss)  was  nearly  two-fold  and  T1/2  nearly  three-fold  higher  in 
patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 ml/min) compared to patients with normal 
renal function (CrCL > 80 ml/min). 
•  Mean  Cmin  increased  about  2-fold  in  mild  and  3-fold  in  moderate  impairment  compared  to 
normal  renal  function.  Means  but  not  SDs  were  below  the  25  ug/ml  threshold  identified  for 
risk of muscle toxicity.  
•  Cmax was not affected by changes in renal function or CLT. 
•  Mean AUC increased 1.2-fold and 1.6-fold in SABIE patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment, respectively, compared to those with CLCR >80 ml/min. Total exposure (AUC) in 
the moderately impaired SAB/IE patients after 6 mg/kg doses (868) was similar to that seen 
with an 8 mg/kg dose in adult healthy volunteers (858) in study DAP-ADT-04-02. This is in 
keeping with AUC values after 4 mg/kg doses in patients with cSSTI that were on average 13 
to 24% lower compared to matched healthy subjects. 
The  comparisons  of  population  PK  between  4  mg/kg  and  6  mg/kg  doses  showed  AUCs  in  such 
patients of 560 (SD 258) with 4 mg/kg and 868 (SD 349) with 6 mg/kg. Taking into account the SD, at 
least  some  patients  with  CrCl  30-50  ml/min  could  achieve  Cmin  values  at  or  above  the  25  µg/ml 
threshold  that  has  been  estimated  to  be  associated  with  elevations  of  CK.  However  the  MAH  has 
provided further analyses and proposed no dose adjustment to 6 mg/kg daily doses until CrCl was < 30 
ml/min.

The  MAH  has  presented  the  actual  values  for  the  15  patients  with  CrCl  in  the  range  30-50  ml/min. 
These  data  demonstrate  a  notable  variability  in  values  and  show  that  the  two  successes  had  plasma 
daptomycin levels that overlapped with the failures. 
Additionally,  simulations  based  on  the final  population  PK  model  were  carried  out  to  determine  the 
typical daptomycin exposure values in non-dialysis patients with varying degree of renal function, as 
shown in the next table.

The  simulations  based  on  a  population  PK  model  that  was  developed  as  an  extension  of  the  one 
initially derived for cSSTI so that it included data from the DAP-IE-01-02 study and two additional 
daptomycin  studies  (DAP-SST-98-01B,  DAP-REN-02-03).  Thus  the  final  population  PK database 
included data from ten Phase 1 and eight Phase 2/3 clinical trials. 
Thus  among  patients  with  CrCl  30  -  <  50  ml/min,  the  mean  Cmin  observed  at  steady  state  (6  mg/kg 
once daily) was 19 µg/ml while the predicted values fall between 14.3 and 22.9 µg/ml. Daptomycin 
exposure in patients with CrCl 30-50 ml/min dosed at 6 mg/kg once daily was within the range of that 
seen in subjects with normal renal function when given daptomycin in doses of 8-12 mg/kg daily over 
2  weeks.  The  comparison  between  studies  was  proposed  to  support  no  alteration  in  the  daptomycin 
dose or dose regimen in patients whose calculated creatinine clearance is ≥ 30 ml/min.  
For the two patients with CrCl < 30 ml/min who were dosed at 6 mg/kg once daily,  the actual Cmin 
values at steady state were 25.4 and 21.4 µg/ml while the predicted Cmin at steady state for the dose of 
6 mg/kg administered once every other day ranged between 6.23 and 10 µg/ml. Therefore, the MAH 
claimed that the proposed regimen of 6 mg/kg once every 48 hours for patients with CrCl < 30 ml/min 
ensures adequate patient safety. 
When  PK  parameters  were  evaluated  by  IEAC  Final  diagnosis  results  were  generally  similar  for 
patients with final diagnoses of complicated and uncomplicated bacteraemia and with LIE. Cmax and 
AUC  were  lower  in  patients  with  RIE  although  numbers  in  these  subgroups  were  small  and  the 
variability  was  large.  Nevertheless,  patients  with  RIE  were  younger  (38.9 years  vs  54.6 years  in  the 
other  patients)  and  had  higher  CrCl  (12/17  vs  50/91  >80  ml/min),  which  would  result  in  a  higher 
predicted CL. Also, patients with RIE were more likely to have intravenous drug users (IVDU) as a 
risk  factor  (88.2%)  compared  to  the  patients  with  LIE  and  bacteraemia  (8.8%),  and  this  alone  may 
account for an increase in clearance in this subgroup.  
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR

A trend towards increasing CPK with increasing exposure to daptomycin as measured by AUC(ss) and 
Cmin(ss) was noted. However, this trend was observed for CPK levels within the normal range and the 
number of observations of CPK above the upper limit was limited.  
2.2.1.4  Discussion 
Dose regimen 
It appears that 4 mg/kg is potentially an insufficient dose for treating RIE and that doses higher than 
6 mg/kg  would  not  be  likely  to  be  more  efficacious.  In  general,  the  safety  profile  of  daptomycin  at 
6 mg/kg in SABIE patients was  similar to that for comparative treatments except for the anticipated 
excess of AEs associated with increased CK with daptomycin. Therefore, 6 mg/kg once daily can be 
viewed as a conservative regimen for patients with RIE and CrCl >50 ml/min.  
Regarding the proposal that 6 mg/kg should be used to treat cSSTI when accompanied by bacteraemia 
rather  than  the  4  mg/kg  dose  currently  approved  for  cSSTI  the  need  for  the  higher  dose  cannot  be 
established  unequivocally.  However,  use  of  the  higher  dose  would  provide  a  conservative  approach 
and there is no major reason to reject this proposal provided that the SPC is worded carefully to avoid 
over-use of the higher dose in cSSTI patients.  
Concerning treatment of RIE and cSSTI when accompanied by bacteraemia the MAH proposed that 
for  a  6  mg/kg  once  daily  regimen  no  dose  adjustment  is  recommended  for  patients  with  creatinine 
clearance ≥ 30 ml/min. This issue was extensively discussed by the CHMP in particular concern was 
raised regarding:  
- 
- 
- 
  Whether  or  not  a  dose  reduction  was  needed  in  patients  with  CrCl  in  the  range  30  - 
<50 ml/min. The comparisons of population PK between 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg doses showed 
AUCs in such patients of 560 (SD 258) with 4 mg/kg and 868 (SD 349) with 6 mg/kg. Based 
on  the  standard  deviation,  at  least  some  patients  with  CrCl  30-50  ml/min  dosed  at  6  mg/kg 
once  daily  could  achieve  Cmin  values  at  or  above  the  25  µg/ml  threshold  that  has  been 
estimated to be associated with elevations of CK. Therefore, it was considered that 6 mg/kg 
once daily should be recommended only for patients with CrCl of at least 50 ml/min. 
Although  a  reduction  to  4  mg/kg  daily  was  suggested  when  CrCl  is  in  the  range  30  - 
<50 ml/min  there  was  concern  that  this  dose  could  be  inadequate  for  treating  S.  aureus 
bacteraemia.  
The  lack  of  safety  and  efficacy  data  with  respect  to  6  mg/kg  every  48  h  in  those  with  CrCl 
<30 ml/min.  This  was  especially  of  concern  given  the  observations  made  in  the  initial 
application  dossier  that  unduly  cautious  dose  reduction  in  the  cSSTI  studies  was  associated 
with poor efficacy. 
The  observation  that  daptomycin  group  patients  with  decreased  renal  function  (especially 
when CrCl was 30 to <50 ml/min) were more likely to experience SAEs. No such difference 
was  noted  in  the  comparator  group.  Patients  with  decreased  renal  function  had  higher 
exposures to daptomycin. Despite this fact there was also an excess of failure associated with 
PRSA in these patients. 
Therefore, 6 mg/kg once daily can be viewed as a conservative regimen for patients with RIE or cSSTI 
associated with Staphylococcus  aureus bacteraemia and CrCL> 50 ml/min. 
Furthermore, a statement informing that there are no data available to support the efficacy of 4 mg/kg 
daily  in  patients  with  RIE  or  cSSTI  associated  with  Staphylococcus  aureus  bacteraemia  whose 
creatinine clearance is between 30-49 ml/min or to support the use of 4 mg/kg every 48 hours in such 
patients whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min should be introduced in the SPC.

Therapeutic indications 
Following  the  adoption  of  Major  Objections  by  the  CHMP  in  October  2006,  the  following question 
was posed to the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), which was considered on 7 December 2006: 
“In the light of the data provided in study DAP-IE-01-02 does the SAG consider that if the MAH can 
satisfactorily address the CHMP list of questions, then the following indications might be considered? 
•  Right sided endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus 
•  Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia with no identifiable focus of infection” 
The SAG made the following recommendations to the CHMP 
• 
If reassurance for RIE is provided (in particular, reassurance that patient groups are comparable) 
and that the small dominator is emphasised in the SPC, this indication may be supportable. 
•  The indication complicated bacteraemia is not supported 
•  The feasibility of the diagnosis uncomplicated bacteraemia has to be re-considered. Concern was 
expressed  that  this  diagnosis  does  not  exist,  because  condition  might  be  due  to  undiagnosed 
cryptogenic infection.  
The CHMP considerations for each indication are discussed below. 
Right-sided infective endocarditis 
The  CHMP  was  concerned  that  a  final  IEAC  diagnosis  of  RIE  pertained  to  only  35  patients.  While 
efficacy  appeared  to  be  very  similar  between  daptomycin  and  comparative  therapy  the  95%  CI  are 
inevitably  wide  although  evenly  distributed  around  zero.  However  it  was  also  recognised  that 
accumulating such patients is not easy, as demonstrated by the total finally identified from the number 
enrolled into this study in which all patients had staphylococcal bacteraemia at enrolment. Overall, the 
CHMP considered that an indication for use in RIE due to S. aureus is approvable as long as the SPC 
carefully reflects the limitations of the data and that the RMP was amended appropriately to cover the 
new dose and indication (see section 3.5). 
Bacteraemia without infective endocarditis 
With  regard  to  the  majority  of  the  patients  in  this  study,  with  a  final  IEAC  diagnoses  other  than  IE 
(including 121 with complicated bacteraemia and 61 with uncomplicated bacteraemia) it appears that 
the population was very heterogeneous with regard to exactly what was being treated in addition to the 
bacteraemia.  
The definition of uncomplicated S. aureus bacteraemia included the requirement that there should be 
no metastatic foci of infection or infection of prosthetic material (not including intravascular foreign 
material removed by Day 4). The definition of complicated bacteraemia included those with metastatic 
foci and infection involving prosthetic material, including intravascular foreign material not removed 
by Day 4.  
In order for the CHMP to consider any possible indication for the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia 
not associated with IE the MAH was requested to provide an analysis based on the sites of S. aureus 
infection  that  were  known  or  very  likely  to  be  present  at  study  entry.  Thus,  the  MAH  was  asked  to 
estimate how many patients had bacteraemia in association with specific infections and how many had 
a truly cryptogenic bacteraemia.  
The  retrospective  review  found  that  150/235  (63.8%)  of  the  total  patients  enrolled  had  bacteraemia 
with no documented foci of infection at baseline. These patients with bacteraemia only at baseline had 
similar success rates whether treated with daptomycin (34/78; 43.6%) or comparator (31/72; 43.1%) 
[∆  0.5%,  95%  CI:  -15.3%-16.4%].  However,  only  34/150  had  an  IEAC  Final  diagnosis  of  uBAC, 
which means that the majority (116/150) of these patients had a diagnosis of IE and/or metastatic foci 
of infection identified only after initiation of therapy.  Correspondingly 27/61 ITT patients with a Final 
diagnosis  of  uBAC  had  no  identifiable  focus  of  infection  at  baseline  but  must  have  had  a  focus  of 
infection  identified  at  baseline.  Overall  the  study  was  not  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of 
daptomycin  in  patients  with  and  without  identifiable  foci  of  S.  aureus  infection  either  at  baseline  or 
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR

discovered later. The CHMP considered that an unqualified indication for use in S. aureus bacteraemia 
was completely untenable since this would imply that daptomycin could be used to treat any focus of 
S.  aureus  infection  that  was  identified  before  or  after discovery of  the  bacteraemia  when  in  fact  the 
drug has only been shown to be efficacious in cSSTI and RIE. The retrospective review also made it 
untenable to consider an indication for use in patients with no identifiable focus of infection since it 
was  clear  from  the  study  that  the  population  with  no  focus  found  throughout  the  study  period  was 
small  and  that  many  of  the  150  with  no  focus  known  at  baseline  were  later  found  to  have  (primary 
and/or secondary) foci during treatment. Based on these considerations the CHMP considered that the 
evidence  for  the  use  of  daptomycin  in  the  treatment  of  S.  aureus  bacteraemia  (other  than  when 
associated  with  cSSTI  or  RIE)  remained  difficult  to  interpret  and  was  inadequate  to  support  the 
indication proposed. 
The MAH acknowledged the CHMP opinion that the study DAP-IE-01-02 results do not fully support 
an indication of daptomycin in the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia other than when associated with 
cSSTI  or  RIE.  The  MAH  consequently  withdrew  this  indication  for  the  requested  extension  of 
indication. 
The MAH’s decision not to pursue an indication for S. aureus bacteraemia other than when associated 
with the approved indications resolves the Major Objection that was raised during the procedure.  
Granting a specific indication for use in Staphylococcus aureus  bacteraemia (SAB) when  associated 
with RIE or with cSSTI is a departure from the usual CHMP stance regarding endorsement for use in 
concurrent bacteraemia and does set a precedent. However, this is the first application in which very 
substantial  data  on  the  use  of  an  antibacterial  agent  to  treat  infections  with  concurrent  bacteraemia 
have been provided and therefore in this instance a specific endorsement for such use is considered to 
be appropriate.  
Other issues 
The rate of IEAC failure due to persistent or relapsing infection SAB (PRSA) at TOC was numerically 
higher in the daptomycin group but there remained no clear explanation for this observation in terms 
of any particular factors that might have given rise to different response rates. Regarding patients with 
reduced  creatinine  clearance,  the  MAH  has  demonstrated  that  there  is  no  interaction  on  a 
multiplicative  scale,  i.e.  that  the  relative  risk  of  failure  due  to  PRSA  is  not  different  between 
daptomycin and comparator treated patients. However, the risk of failure is higher in the daptomycin 
group  and  therefore  an  identical  relative  risk  leads  to  a  higher  absolute  increase  in  risk,  which  is 
potentially problematic. The fact that there was a significant effect of age for PRSA in the daptomycin 
group supported this concern. 
The  SPC  already  contained  information  on  the  six  daptomycin-treated  patients  with  isolates  that 
showed increasing MICs who were considered failures at TOC due to PRSA and so contribute to the 
overall  picture.  The  CHMP  recommended  that  an  expanded  section  on  Information  from  clinical 
studies should be inserted into section 5.1 of the SPC along with details of these PRSA failure rates 
since these data are relevant to cSSTI.

Clinical safety 
Data  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  the  clinical  safety  stem  for  the  main  study  DAP-IE-01-02  are 
detailed below. The results of the supportive study DAP-ADT-04-02 did not bring any relevant results 
to this discussion and are therefore not described.

2.3.1  Main study – DAP-IE-01-02  
2.3.1.1  Patient exposure 
Among the 120 daptomycin patients the mean daily dose administered was 5.9 ± 0.30 mg/kg with a 
median  of  6.0  mg/kg.  Only  one  patient  in  the  daptomycin  group  had  a  dose  adjustment  for  renal 
failure. The mean total daily daptomycin dose administered was 487 ± 116.2 mg/day with a median of  
478 mg/day. 
Total Adverse Events 
There  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  the  incidence  of 
TEAEs  by  MedDRA  SOC  except  that  more  patients  in  the  comparator  group  had  AEs  mapped  to 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions. This reflected the higher rates of oedema, pain 
and  discomfort,  febrile  disorders,  asthenic  conditions  and  injection  and  infusion  site  reactions.  The 
most commonly reported events in the daptomycin group were anaemia and gastro-intestinal AEs but 
these were not more common than in the comparator group. The incidence of pharyngolaryngeal pain 
was higher in the daptomycin group (8.3%) than in the comparator group (1.7%). 
AEs  judged  by  the  Investigators  to  be  severe  or  marked  in  intensity  were  reported  in  45.8% 
daptomycin  and  45.7%  comparator  group  patients.  The  most  common  severe  event  was  sepsis, 
reported in 5.0% and 2.6% in respective groups.  
Failure Due to AEs 
A  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  comparator  group  (14.8%)  were  assessed  by  the  IEAC  as 
treatment failures due to AEs compared to the daptomycin group (6.7%), as shown in the next table. 
In  the  comparator  group,  the  most  common  AEs  reported  as  the  reason  for  treatment  failure  were 
hypersensitivity type events, including rash, red man syndrome and anaphylaxis (6 patients), and renal 
toxicities  (5  patients).  In  the  daptomycin  group,  the  most  commonly  reported  events  were  rash  
(2 patients), increased CPK (2 patients) and gastrointestinal events (2 patients). 
Five of the 17 patients in the comparator group who were failures due to AEs died compared to one 
patient in the daptomycin group. In 3/5 deaths in the comparator group the IEAC Final diagnosis was 
complicated bacteraemia. SAEs seen in these five were cardiovascular collapse, sepsis, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage with renal and respiratory failure and cerebral infarction plus septic shock. The other two 
patients had an IEAC Final diagnosis of LIE with SAEs of hemorrhagic stroke associated with heparin 
therapy and cerebral infarction plus septic shock. The daptomycin patient who died had an IEAC Final 
diagnosis of complicated bacteraemia with an SAE of worsening hypoxia. 
Drug-related AEs 
These were reported in 35.0% daptomycin and 42.2% comparator group patients. The most commonly 
reported  drug-related  AE  was  diarrhoea  but  the  incidence  was  1.7%  and  9.5%  in  respective  groups. 
Other  drug-related  events  reported  in  ≥  5%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  included  CPK 
increased (5.0% and 0% per group), renal failure (1.7% and 6.0%) and nausea (1.7% and 5.2%). 
Rates  for  severe  drug-related  AEs  were  6/120  (5.0%)  for  daptomycin  and  13/116  (11.2%)  for 
comparator group patients.  
In the daptomycin group these included two patients with renal failure and two with rash. There were 
also  single  cases  of  blood  phosphorus  increased  and  vomiting,  atrial  flutter  and  atrial  fibrillation, 
cardiac arrest and hallucinations. 
In the comparator group, these included 5 reports of renal disorders (renal failure acute, renal tubular 
type  events  (hypersensitivity  reaction,  dermatitis 
necrosis)  and  4  reports  of  drug-allergy 
medicamentosa,  red  man  syndrome,  anaphylactic  reaction).  Others  included  pyrexia,  nausea  with 
diarrhoea, pulmonary infarction and abnormal liver function tests.

AEs of special note 
The overall incidence of infections was slightly higher in the daptomycin group (54.2% and 48.3%) 
while the incidence of severe infections was 21.7% and 19.8% in respective groups. In addition, 6.7% 
daptomycin and 1.7% comparator group patients had an infection that was assessed as drug-related by 
the Investigators. 
Among 13 daptomycin patients with sepsis, bacteraemia or septic shock the infection occurred during 
treatment or 1 day post-treatment in 8 patients and occurred more than one week post-treatment in the 
remaining 5. None of events of sepsis or bacteraemia were assessed as drug-related by the Investigator 
in either treatment group. 
There  was  no  excess  of  respiratory  tract  TEAEs,  renal  tract  TEAEs  or  incidence  of  C.  difficile 
enterocolitis in the daptomycin group. Despite the known association between daptomycin and raised 
CPK, with or without symptoms, musculoskeletal or connective tissue TEAEs were reported in 29.2% 
in the daptomycin group and in 36.2% in the comparator group. One event in the daptomycin group 
(myalgia) and 4 events in 2 patients in the comparator group (2 of arthralgia and one each of neck pain 
and pain in extremity) were assessed as drug-related by the Investigators. Severe musculoskeletal and 
connective  tissue  disorders  were  reported  in  2.5%  and  1.7%  of  patients  in  the  daptomycin  and 
comparator groups, respectively. Nevertheless, as expected, the incidence of raised CPK was 6.7% in 
the daptomycin group (8 patients) and <1% (one patient) in the comparator group (discussed below). 
In  both  treatment  groups,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  higher  in  females  but  incidences  within 
gender were similar between treatments. The incidence of cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, 
infections and infestations, skin and respiratory disorders was higher in females compared to males in 
both the daptomycin and comparator groups but did not appear to be substantially different between 
treatments. 
In both treatment groups the overall incidence of AEs was higher in patients aged ≥65 years but rates 
within  the  age  groups  were  similar  between  treatments.  The  incidence  of  cardiac  disorders, 
gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations and respiratory disorders was higher in patients 
aged ≥65 years. The incidence of blood and lymphatic system, eye and skin disorders was higher in 
older patients in the daptomycin group. The incidence of general disorders and musculoskeletal system 
disorders  was  higher  in  younger  patients  than  older  patients  within  the  daptomycin  group  but  rates 
were not higher than seen with comparators. 
Deaths 
Thirty-seven  (15.7%)  of  the  236  patients  died  during  the  study  or  in  post-study  follow-up.  These 
included  18/120  (15.0%)  in  the  daptomycin  group  and  19/116  (16.4%)  comparator-treated  patients. 
Death occurred within 30 days of the last dose in 14 (11.7%) and 12 (10.3%) per group and varied by 
IEAC final diagnosis.  
Among 18 deaths in the daptomycin group 15 (83.3%) patients were aged ≥65 year including 10 aged 
≥75 years. One death, which was a cardiac arrest reported in an 87-year-old female while being treated 
with daptomycin, was judged to be possibly related to treatment by the Investigator. However, review 
of the narrative does not suggest that daptomycin likely contributed to death. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall  114/236  patients  experienced  at  least  one  SAE  including  62/120  (51.7%)  daptomycin  and 
52/116  (44.8%)  in  the  comparator  group.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between 
the  treatment  groups  for  SAEs  within  any  MedDRA  SOC  except  that  serious  renal  and  urinary 
disorders  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  comparator  group  and  the  incidence  of  serious 
infections was higher in the daptomycin group. 
Serious  events  in  both  treatment  groups  were  most  commonly  reported  in  the  infections  and 
infestations  SOC  and  the  most  commonly  reported  were  in  the  HLT  of  sepsis,  bacteraemia  and 
viraemia (8.3% daptomycin group and 6.0% in the comparator group).  
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR 
22/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  majority  of  SAEs  were  assessed  as  unrelated  to  study  treatment  but  3  in  the  daptomycin  group 
(2.5%)  and  6  in  the  comparator  group  (5.2%)  experienced  SAEs  that  were  reported  by  the 
Investigators as drug-related. Possibly related SAEs in the daptomycin group included an elevation in 
CPK that resolved within 6 days, atrial flutter/fibrillation and renal failure in a patient who entered the 
study  with  renal  insufficiency  and  the  cardiac  arrest  leading  to  death  as  detailed  above.  In  the 
comparator group, drug-related SAEs included renal failure or renal tubular necrosis in four patients 
and one patient each with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and anaphylaxis. 
In  the  daptomycin  group,  patients  with  decreased  renal  function  (especially  when  CLcr  was  
30  to  <  50  ml/min)  were  more  likely  to  experience  SAEs.  No  such  difference  was  noted  in  the 
comparator group. 
Patients with AEs and SAEs of Infections Potentially Related to SAB/IE 
Events  mapped  to  the  Infections  and  Infestations  SOC  that  were  potentially  related  to  S.  aureus 
bacteraemia or IE were identified by the medical monitor based on 34 preferred terms. For any AE and 
any SAE, the incidence of these events was higher in the daptomycin group. 
In order to assess the possible relationship of these reported events to the failure of study treatment, an 
analysis was conducted to evaluate the IEAC outcome at TOC and EOT for this patient subset.  
The  failure  rate  in  this  patient  subset  was  higher  than  that  observed  in  the  total  population  in  both 
treatment groups. The failure rate at TOC for patients with SAEs potentially related to SAB/IE was 
higher in the comparator group but the rate at EOT was higher in the daptomycin group.   
Also,  11  (9.2%)  daptomycin  and  13  (11.2%)  comparator  patients  experienced  at  least  one  event 
potentially  related  to  S.  aureus  pneumonia.  In  14/24  the  IEAC  Final  diagnosis  was  IE,  including  7 
with  RIE  and  7  with  LIE,  while  8  had  a  final  diagnosis  of  complicated  bacteraemia  and  two  had 
uncomplicated  bacteraemia.  In  four  and  seven  per  group  no  additional  antibiotic  therapy  was 
associated with the event. None of these AEs was assessed as drug-related by the Investigators and all 
were reported as resolved. One patient in the daptomycin group was discontinued from the study due 
to  pneumonia.  Eighteen  of  the  24  patients,  including  9  in  each  treatment  group,  were  reported  as 
failures at TOC by the IEAC 
Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
Overall  41/236  patients  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AEs  including  20  (16.7%)  daptomycin 
and  21  (18.1%)  in  the  comparator  group.  In  10  and  13  in  respective  groups  the  AEs  that  led  to 
treatment discontinuation were considered drug-related. In the daptomycin group these included three 
reports  of  increased  CPK,  three  of  rash  and  one  report  each  of  vomiting,  renal  failure, 
thrombocytopenia and cardiac arrest. In the comparator group, drug-related AEs leading to treatment 
withdrawal  included  rashes  and  hypersensitivity  reactions  in  7  patients,  four  with  renal  toxicity  and 
two with pyrexia. 
Laboratory data 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  or  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  treatment 
groups for changes from baseline in haematology parameters except that mean haemoglobin increased 
from baseline to EOT by 1.4 g/l in the daptomycin group and decreased from baseline to EOT by -
1.7 g/l in the comparator group. This difference was statistically significant but was not thought to be 
clinically  meaningful.  Mean  values  at  EOT  for  haemoglobin  were  109.3  g/l  and  105.6  g/l  in  the 
daptomycin and comparator groups, respectively. Changes in coagulation parameters were also similar 
overall between treatments.  
Mean  changes  from  baseline  to  EOT  in  ALT  and  AST  (see  below)  were  statistically  significant 
between groups but again not thought likely to be clinically meaningful. 
There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  for  changes  from 
baseline in CPK to any on-study time point with the exception of Day 14 when mean changes were -
11.2 u/l for daptomycin and -53.1 u/l for comparator patients. At the EOT visit, mean changes from 
baseline  showed  an  increase  (by  37.1 u/l)  in  the daptomycin  group  and  a  decrease  (-32.2  u/l)  in  the 
Cubicin-H-637-II-05-AR 
23/29 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparator  group.  In  contrast,  corresponding  median  changes  were  -5.5  and  -11.5  u/l  in  the 
daptomycin and comparator groups, respectively, which was  mainly due to three outliers with mean 
increases of >2,000 u/l from baseline to EOT. 
With  regard  to  measures  of  renal  function,  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  serum  creatinine  were 
statistically  significantly  higher  in  the  comparator  group  at  most  time  points.  This  may  reflect 
synergistic gentamicin given with vancomycin and SSPs. At EOT, mean changes from baseline were 
6.6  µmol/l  for  daptomycin  and  21.2  µmol/l  in  the  comparator  group  while  actual  mean  creatinine 
values were 102.9 and 
121.9 µmol/l.  
The  most common of these in the daptomycin group was an INR >2.0. The elevations in INR were 
sporadic  in  most  patients  but  were  not  unexpected  given  that  heparin  products  were  administered 
concomitantly in 81.7% (98) of daptomycin and 77.6% (90) of comparator group patients and warfarin 
was administered to 15.8% (19) and 10.3% (12) in respective groups. However, platelet counts were 
<50  x  109/l  in  5.0%  and  1.7%  per  group.  Despite  this,  serious  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  was 
reported in four in the comparator group but none in the daptomycin group. CVA was reported as a 
SAE in two per group and worsening bleeding disorder in one in the comparator group. Only one of 
these  patients  (daptomycin)  with  serious  bleeding  events  had  a  clinically  notable  INR  value  and 
platelet count reported during the study. 
The  most  commonly  reported  laboratory  AE  was  anaemia  (in  12.5%  and  15.5%  per  group).  Other 
laboratory  AEs  reported  in  >5%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  included  hypokalaemia  (9.2% 
and 12.9%), hyperkalaemia (5.0% and 8.6%) and increased blood CPK (6.7% and <1%).  
Mean  changes  in  vital  signs  during  the  study  were  generally  small  and  there  were  no  statistically 
significant differences between the treatment groups for changes from baseline to any time point for 
any  vital  signs  parameter.  There  were  no  notable  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the 
maximum  weekly  temperatures  during  weeks  1  through  6.  In  both  groups,  the  maximum  weekly 
temperature was higher at Baseline than during any study week. 
There were 10 patients (4 daptomycin) with normal or not clinically significantly abnormal baseline 
ECG results who had a shift to an abnormal, clinically significant finding during or post-treatment. All 
ECG abnormalities reported as AEs occurred in only one or 2 patients in either treatment group and 
there  were  no  apparent  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  for  the  types  of  abnormalities 
reported. 
All patients received at least one concomitant medication during the study and the types of commonly 
administered medications were similar between treatments. The most commonly reported classes were 
anilides  (82.5%  and  80.2%),  heparin  group  (81.7%  and  77.6%)  and  natural  opium  alkaloids  (72.5% 
and  77.6%).  Proportions  who  may  have  been  receiving  agents  that  could  potentially  interact  with 
daptomycin to increase the risk of increased CPK, with or without symptoms, are not discussed in the 
study  report.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  20%  in  the  daptomycin  group  and  17.2%  in  the 
comparator group were on HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.

2.3.2  Supportive study – DAP-ADT-04-02 
There were no deaths, SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs in this study. There are no new relevant 
findings on safety concerning this study. 
2.3.3  Discussion  
In general, and referring to the results on safety of the main study, the safety profile of daptomycin at  
6 mg/kg was similar to that for comparative treatments except for the anticipated excess of increased 
CPK with daptomycin. 
In  the  daptomycin  group,  patients  with  decreased  renal  function  (especially  when  CLcr  was  
30  to  <  50  ml/min)  were  more  likely  to  experience  SAEs.  No  such  difference  was  noted  in  the 
comparator group. 
The excess of SAEs in the infections and infestations SOC is in keeping with, and is probably driving, 
the overall finding in this study that the incidence of serious infections was higher in the daptomycin 
group. In fact, the pattern reflects in turn the higher incidence of PRSA in the daptomycin group. 
It  was  previously  recognised  that  failure  rates  were  higher  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function. 
However, since this study required daptomycin dose adjustment only when CrCl fell below 30 ml/min 
and  since  so  few  patients  were  in  this  category,  inadvertent  under-exposure  to  the  drug  was  not  the 
explanation in the daptomycin group.  
It  remains  unclear  why  there  was  a  higher  rate  of  SAEs  (including  SAEs  relating  to  failures)  in 
patients  with  CrCl  below  50  ml/min  in  the  daptomycin  group  (see  discussion  on  dose  regimen  in 
section 3.2.2.1.4). 
All  patients  received  at  least  one  concomitant  medication  during  the  study.  In  fact  20%  in  the 
daptomycin group and 17.2% in the comparator group were on HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. The 
overall picture pointed towards an increasing risk of raised CK when daptomycin was given with an 
HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor. However, the SPC already states the following in 4.4: 
CPK  should  be  measured  more  frequently  than  once  weekly  in  patients  who  are  at  higher  risk  of 
developing  myopathy.  These  patients  include  those  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) and patients taking other medications known to be associated with myopathy 
(e.g. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates and ciclosporin).   
Until  such  time  as  it  may  come  to  light  that  clinically  important  increases  in  CK  are  more  likely  to 
occur during co-administration there does not seem to be a need to amend the current warning. This 
issue has been included in the Risk Management Plan and will continue to receive special attention in 
the PSURs.

 Pharmacovigilance system   
3.1 
Risk Management Plan 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  MAH  should  update  the  RMP  to  reflect  use  of  the  higher  dose  (6 
mg/kg once daily) for RIE and the safety data associated with this. 
The MAH has supplied a revised RMP in which reference is made in several sections to the use of a 6 
mg/kg/day dose. 
A  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  for  daptomycin  highlighting  the  safety  concerns  with 
daptomycin is presented below:

The RMP needs to be further revised  taking into consideration the following points: 
-The RMP should be updated according to the EU-RMP template 
-The  Safety  Specification  refers  to  >  319,000  US  patients  exposed  as  of  March  2007.  This 
denominator should be updated when the revisions to the RMP are finalised. 
-The sections on renal insufficiency should reflect the final EU SPC to result from this variation. 
-The  additions  regarding  6  mg/kg/day  should  reflect  the  uncertainties  that  still  surround  the  safety 
profile of this dose. 
The  MAH  as  committed  to  provide  a  revised  RMP  by  the  next  PSUR  submission  on  11  November 
2007.

Overall discussion and Benefit/Risk Assessment 
In line with the CHMP Note for Guidance, there is sufficient evidence to allow an indication specific 
to the treatment of RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus. The revised SPC resulting from this variation 
clearly states the limited data on which this indication is based. Previously, some concerns were raised 
that  due  to  the  poor  efficacy  of  daptomycin  in  CAP,  which  is  associated  with  chemical  interaction 
between  the  drug  and  surfactant,  RIE  patients  might  be  at  higher  risk  of  infectious  pulmonary 
complications. The numbers are too small to draw definite conclusions on this point but the data are 
not alarming and the SPC already mentions lack of efficacy in pneumonia.  
The  application  did  not  contain  sufficient  evidence  to  support  an  indication  for  use  in  S.  aureus 
bacteraemia with no identifiable focus. However, the data would support a specific endorsement for 
use in S. aureus bacteraemia strictly when associated with the indications to be approved (i.e. cSSTI 
and  RIE  only).  This  is,  in  itself,  a  departure  from  the  more  usual  approach  to  mentioning  use  in 
concurrent  bacteraemia  in  the  SPC  and  should  be  viewed  as  an  exception  that  has  been  considered 
only  because  the  SABIE  study  has  supplied  data  specific  to  patients  with  S.  aureus  bacteraemia, 
resulting in numbers of patients treated that goes far beyond that usually encountered in applications 
concerning antibacterial agents. 
The selection of 6 mg/kg to treat S. aureus bacteraemia and endocarditis in patients with CrCl ≥ 50 
ml/min is accepted to be an appropriately conservative regimen that  may also be applied to patients 
with cSSTI who have concomitant bacteraemia.  
There  has  been  a  detailed  exploration  of  the  fact  that  the  rate  of  IEAC  failure  due  to  persistent  or 
relapsing infection SAB (PRSA) at TOC was numerically higher in the daptomycin group. The CHMP 
considered  that  Information  from  clinical  studies  on  section  5.1  of  the  SPC  should  be  expanded  to 
include details of the PRSA failure rates.

Changes to the product information 
SPC 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The  MAH’s  initially  proposed  to  extend  the  approved  indication  to  Staphylococcus  aureus 
bacteraemia (SAB), including known or suspected Infective Endocarditis (IE) in adults. 
Based  on  the  submitted  data  the  CHMP  considered  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  allow  an 
indication  specific  to  the  treatment  of  RIE  due  to  Staphylococcus  aureus.  However  the  CHMP 
considered that the study DAP-IE-01-02 results do not fully support an indication of daptomycin in the 
treatment  of  S.  aureus  bacteraemia  other  than  when  associated  with  cSSTI  or  RIE.  The  MAH 
acknowledges  the  CHMP  position  and  submitted  a  revised  wording  which  was  agreed  with,  as 
follows:  
“Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
•  Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI) 
•  Right sided Infective Endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus It is recommended 
that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial susceptibility 
of the organism and should be based on expert advice. See sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
•  Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) when associated with RIE or with cSSTI. 
Daptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1).  In mixed infections where 
Gram  negative  and/or  certain  types  of  anaerobic  bacteria  are  suspected,  Cubicin  should  be  co-
administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s).  
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration”  
The  MAH  proposed  to  revise  section  4.2  to  reflect  the  two  possible  dosing  regimens  by  indication. 
This section was further updated to reflect the indications agreed above.  
Furthermore,  this  section  was  revised  to  introduce  detailed  recommendations  concerning  dose 
adjustments in patients with renal insufficiency by indication and creatinine clearance. 
It was highlighted that there are no data available to support the efficacy of 4 mg/kg daily in patients 
with RIE or cSSTI associated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia whose creatinine clearance is 
between  30-49  ml/min  or  to  support  the  use  of  4  mg/kg  every  48  hours  in  such  patients  whose 
creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min. 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
The  MAH’s  initially  proposed  changes  to  section  4.4  were  discussed  and  the  CHMP  proposed  new 
revisions. 
A paragraph was added to advise prescribers to consider instituting alternative antibacterial therapy for 
adjunctive treatment. 
A paragraph was added to reflect the limited clinical data to treat RIE due to Staphylococcus aureus 
and a warning was introduced concerning the lack of data for prosthetic valve infections. 
The MAH proposed a revised wording that was agreed with by the CHMP. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
The  MAH  initially  proposed  to  slightly  update  this  section  to  reflect  additional  data  in  the 
denominators and rates. The CHMP considered that the introductory paragraph should be revised to 
state  how  many  patients  have  been  treated  with  4  or  6  mg/kg  with  the  indication  mentioned  and  to 
make clear that the totals mentioned included both health volunteers and patients with infections. 
The MAH proposed a revised wording that was agreed with by the CHMP.

Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
The MAH’s initially proposed wording introduced the results of the main study. The CHMP proposed 
the revision of this section to reflect the results obtained for the patients treated with daptomicyn who 
met the criteria for RIE. 
Section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” 
The MAH has proposed a minor change to this section based on the PK results and to reflect the two 
doses. The initial wording was slightly revised. 
Section 5.3 “Preclinical safety data” 
The MAH proposed to revise preclinical safety data concerning myotoxicity and neurotoxicity to 
support the higher dose. The MAH has introduced the changes proposed by the CHMP. 
Annex IIB 
Annex II was updated to mention that an updated RMP should be provided as per CHMP guideline on 
the risk management systems for medicinal products for human use. 
PL 
The PL was updated in accordance with the changes proposed to the SPC.

1. Introduction 
On 12 April 2021, the MAH submitted a completed study including a subset of paediatric patients 
(Study CETB115B1401) for Revolade (eltrombopag), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
Only 33 of 2019 total subjects in the safety analysis set of study CETB115B1401 were between 1 and 
18 years. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information  on the development  program 
Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable,  small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist, approved for 
marketing in the EU through the centralised procedure on 15th March 2010.  
Eltrombopag is currently indicated in the paediatric and adult population for the treatment of patients 
aged 1 year and above with primary  immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from 
diagnosis and who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, the application included an EMA 
Decision on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for the condition ITP, which included 
a waiver in all subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 1 years of age 
(P/0167/2016; EMEA-000170-PIP01-07-M04). All studies/measures agreed in this PIP were conducted 
in accordance with the PIP decision (EMEA-C-000170-PIP01-07-M03). 
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, Novartis Pharma AG hereby 
submits to the EMA a final study report for study CETB115B1401. This study was performed in Japan 
to meet a regulatory requirement of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for 
market authorization (post-approval measure). 
The MAH stated that study CETB115B1401 “Drug-use Results Surveillance of Revolade Tablets (Chronic 
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura)” is a stand alone study. As such, a line listing is not provided. 
1.2.  Information  on the pharmaceutical  formulation  used in the study 
Two pharmaceutical formulations of eltrombopag  for oral administration have been approved in the 
European Union:  
•  12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg film-coated tablets, and 
•  25 mg powder for oral suspension (PfOS). 
In the hereby submitted study, eltrombopag was administered orally in Japanese patients in the 
conditions of usual practice in Japan. Eltrombopag was approved in Japan on 27 October 2010 for the 
treatment of chronic ITP (cITP). 
Study CETB115B1401 was a non-controlled study where all patients received eltrombopag as film-
coated tablets in dosage strengths of 12.5 mg and 25 mg.  
The formulations of eltrombopag used in the study were the same as the products approved in the EU. 
No new data were submitted for the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study CETB115B1401.

18 years. 
1.3.2.  Clinical  study 
Clinical study CETB115B1401: “Drug-use Results Surveillance of Revolade Tablets (Chronic 
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura)” 
Description 
Study CETB115B1401 collected clinical data on long-term safety and effectiveness of eltrombopag 
under the Japanese real clinical setting after launching this product to meet a regulatory requirement 
of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for market authorization (post-approval 
measure) in Japan. 
This was an all-case, multicenter, central registration-based, non-controlled, observational, post-
marketing survey conducted in Japanese adult and paediatric patients with chronic ITP who were 
administered eltrombopag  (12.5 mg and 25 mg film-coated tablets) in accordance to locally approved 
prescribing information. 
Methods 
Objective 
The primary  objective of this study, performed in conditions of Japanese real-world setting under 
authorised indications of eltrombopag  (as film-coated tablets in strengths of 12.5 mg and 25 mg), was 
to investigate its safety and effectiveness over long-term clinical use in patients with cITP.  
No secondary or exploratory  objectives were planned. 
Study design 
This was an all-case, multicenter, central registration-based, non-controlled, observational, post-
marketing survey, performed in Japan for adult and paediatric patients with chronic ITP who 
administered eltrombopag  (12.5 mg and 25 mg film-coated tablets) in accordance to locally approved 
prescribing information, to investigate its safety and effectiveness in conditions of a real-world setting.  
The follow-up period for each patient was 1 year from the start of this drug with an additional 1-year 
extension in patients willing to continue in this study. 
Study population /Sample size 
This was an all-case study. Therefore, the study population included all cITP patients to whom 
eltrombopag was administered.  
The target sample size for registration was 1,000 cITP patients.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
From the start date of study (December 10, 2010, market launch date) to the end date (October 16, 
2020, database lock), a total of 5843 patients were registered at 1174 centers. Among them, CRFs 
were collected from 2163 patients at 686 centers.  
A total of 2019 patients were included in the safety analysis set and 144 patients were excluded. Of 
these 2019 patients, 33 patients (1.63%) were reported to be under 18 years of age. A total of 2,018 
patients are included in the effectiveness analysis set after excluding 1 patient for “evaluation not 
done” from the safety analysis set. 
Baseline data 
The majority of patients were female (59.88%, n=1209) and 40.12% (n=810) were male. Elderly 
patients (≥65 years) accounted for 51.46% (n=1039) and paediatric patients (<18 years) accounted 
for 1.63% (n=33). There were 4 pregnant women (0.33%). 
Pre-treatment complications were reported in 1553 (76.92%) patients, including renal impairment 
(12.23%, n=247), hepatic impairment  (20.01%, n=404), and other complications (72.36%, n=1461). 
Ninety-seven (4.80%) patients were predisposed to thromboembolism. 
Effectiveness results 
A patient was considered a responder if the last test in the CRF (laboratory tests/others – global 
improvement  rating) was listed as “improved” and a non-responder if “unchanged”, “worsened”, or 
“others” was chosen.  
The proportion of responders and non-responders were similar between the paediatric (<18 years) 
population and adult (≥18 years) population: 51.52% (17/33 paediatric patients) vs. 42.42% (14/33

Safety results 
The median number of total treatment days on eltrombopag was 216 days (range from 1 to 728 days).  
Of the 33 paediatric patients in the study, 7 patients (21.21%) experienced adverse reactions 
considered to be related to study drug compared to 24.71% (488/1975 patients, odds ratio: 0.8204, 
95% CI: 0.3539-1.9019) in patients aged 18 years and above (Table 2). No deaths occurred in 
paediatric patients. 
In the paediatric population, the adverse reactions considered related to study drug were headache 
(n=2), pharyngitis (n=1), neuroblastoma (n=1), alopecia (n=1), white blood cell count decreased 
(n=1) and platelet count increased (n=1). The events of pharyngitis and neuroblastoma occurred only 
in the paediatric patients. The pharyngitis in the patient was a non-serious adverse reaction and its 
outcome was resolved. The event of neuroblastoma was a serious adverse reaction reported in a 2-
year-old boy. While the relationship of the event to eltrombopag  was unknown/not recorded, this event 
was counted as an adverse reaction related to study drug (conservative approach). The outcome of the 
event was resolved 348 days after the date of occurrence. 
There were no incidences of thromboembolic  adverse reactions in the paediatric population.

Based on the available data, no differences were observed in the safety profile of eltrombopag in 
paediatric and adult patients in study CETB115B1401 as most adverse events that occurred in 
paediatric patients were generally observed in adults.  
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This Article 46 procedure of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, concerns the submission of 
the stand-alone study CETB115B1401: “Drug-use Results Surveillance of Revolade Tablets (Chronic 
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura)”. 
Study CETB115B1401, which is not part of a PIP, was performed in Japan to meet a regulatory 
requirement of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for market authorization 
(post-approval measure). 
The primary  objective of this post-marketing Japanese study was to investigate the safety and 
effectiveness of eltrombopag (12.5 mg and 25 mg), administered orally as film-coated tablets, over 
long-term clinical use in patients with cITP. Despite the lack of a comparison group and the limitations 
expected to any observational study, the study design (all-case, multicenter, central registration-
based, non-controlled, observational, post-marketing) is considered acceptable.   
From the start date of study (December 10, 2010, market launch date) to the end date (October 16, 
2020, database lock), a total of 5843 patients were registered at 1174 centers. Among them, CRFs 
were collected from 2163 patients at 686 centers.  
Only 33 of 2019 total subjects (1.63%) in the safety analysis set of study CETB115B1401 were 
between 1 and 18 years. 
Regarding the effectiveness results, the proportion  of responders and non-responders patients were 
similar between the paediatric (<18 years) population and adult (≥18 years) population: 51.52% 
(17/33 paediatric patients) vs. 42.42% (14/33 paediatric patients) and 43.67% (862/1974 adult 
patients) vs. 45.80% (904/1974 adult patients), respectively. 
With regard to safety data, 7 (21.21%) out of the 33 paediatric patients in the study experienced 
adverse reactions considered to be related to study drug compared to 24.71% (488/1975 patients, 
odds ratio: 0.8204,95% CI: 0.3539-1.9019) in patients aged 18 years and above. No deaths occurred 
in paediatric patients.  
In the paediatric population, the adverse reactions considered related to study drug were headache 
(n=2), pharyngitis (n=1), neuroblastoma (n=1), alopecia (n=1), white blood cell count decreased 
(n=1) and platelet count increased (n=1). The events of pharyngitis and neuroblastoma occurred only 
in the paediatric patients. The pharyngitis in the patient was a non-serious adverse reaction and its 
outcome was resolved. The event of neuroblastoma was a serious adverse reaction reported in a 2-
year-old boy. While the relationship of the event to eltrombopag  was unknown/not recorded, this event 
was counted as an adverse reaction related to study drug (conservative approach). The outcome of the

event was resolved 348 days after the date of occurrence. However,  the Applicant has not stated how 
the neuroblastoma was treated (chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy) to be solved. 
There were no incidences of thromboembolic  adverse reactions in the paediatric population. 
Based on the available data, the effectiveness and safety profile observed in this study is consistent 
with the known safety profile of eltrombopag.   
As the benefit risk assessment remains unchanged and positive, no further regulatory is action 
required. 
2.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Results obtained in the study CETB115B1401 performed in Japan for patients with with cITP treated 
with eltrombopag (12.5 mg and 25 mg), administered orally as film-coated tablets under the real 
clinical setting after launching these formulations, are consistent to the EU summary product 
characteristics (SmPC) and not modify the risk/benefit profile of eltrombopag  12.5 mg and 25 mg film-
coated tablets.  
Paediatric population in that study was very limited (N=33) and the long-term results of effectiveness 
and safety were similar to that shown in adults. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

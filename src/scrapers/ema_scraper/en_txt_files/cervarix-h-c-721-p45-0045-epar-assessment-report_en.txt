1.  Recommendation 
The conclusions of the MAH are endorsed: this clinical trial does not change the positive risk/benefit 
analysis of Cervarix. No changes are proposed to the SPC. 
2.  Introduction 
Cervarix is indicated for the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally 
related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. The indication is based on the demonstration 
of efficacy in women aged 15-25 years following vaccination with Cervarix and on the immunogenicity 
of the vaccine in girls and women aged 10-25 years. 
The MAH submitted one completed paediatric study for Cervarix, in accordance with Article 45 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. A short critical 
expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Cervarix and 
that there is no consequential regulatory action.

3.3.2.  Clinical studies 
Clinical study 104951 (HPV-033) 
Description 
This study is a double-blind, randomised, controlled study involving 321 healthy female subjects 
between 10 and 14 years of age with as aim to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK’s HPV-
16/18 vaccine administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule. This was evaluated 
in comparison with the control group, receiving the HAV-vaccine at the same time schedule. 
Methods 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate antibody responses against HPV-16 and HPV-18 (by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) in all HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine recipients at 
Month 7. 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate: 
−  Serious adverse events (SAEs) up to Month 7 
−  Solicitated local and general symptoms (Days 0 – 6) 
−  Unsolicited symptoms (Days 0 – 29) 
−  Biochemical and haematological parameters at Months 0 and 7 
−  Occurrence of new onset chronic diseases and other medically significant conditions 
• 
Study design 
A phase III, multicentre, double-blind, randomised and controlled trial with two parallel groups, 
HPV and HAV (Hepatitis A Virus) vaccine groups. All subjects received either the candidate HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP S04 vaccine or the HAV control vaccine according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule. Four 
study visits were scheduled at Months 0, 1, 6 and 7. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects 
at two time points in the study: one prior to vaccination and the second blood sample was drawn 
one month after the third vaccine dose (i.e. post-dose 3 Month 7). 
• 
Study population /Sample size 
321 healthy female subjects between 10 and 14 years of age. 
• 
Treatments 
Study vaccine (HPV): three doses of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine administered by 
intramuscular injection in the non-dominant arm.  
Reference vaccine (HAV): three doses of GSK Biologicals’ hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix) 
administered by intramuscular injection in the non-dominant arm.

during the first 7 days  
−  Occurrence,  intensity  and  relationship  to  vaccination  of  unsolicited  symptoms  within  30  after 
any vaccination. 
−  Occurrence of clinically relevant abnormalities in biochemical and haematological parameters at 
Months 0 and 7  
−  Occurrence of new onset chronic diseases and other medically significant conditions throughout 
the study period (up to Month 7) regardless of causal relationship to vaccination and intensity.  
−  Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers (by ELISA) at Month 0 and Month 7.

Statistical method 
Analysis of demography: Demographic characteristics (age, race) of each study cohort were 
tabulated. The mean age (plus range and standard deviation) of the enrolled subjects, as a whole 
and per group, were calculated. The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study centers 
were tabulated as a whole and per group. 
Analysis of immunogenicity: For each time point that serological results were available, the 
following were calculated with their exact 95% confidence intervals for each group: Anti-HPV-16, 
anti-HPV-18 and anti-HAV (all measured by ELISA): seropositivity and seroconversion rates for 
the antibodies. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and range of antibody titers were tabulated for 
antibodies against each antigen. The distribution of antibody titers at Month 7 for each antigen for 
subjects who were initially seronegative at pre-vaccination was displayed using Reverse 
cumulative distribution curves (RCCs). 
Analysis of safety: The two-sided standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the difference of SAE rates 
(SAE rate in HAV Group minus SAE rate in HPV control Group) was computed (Proc StatXact 5.0). 
The comparison was done by subject, considering all SAEs at the same and then considering 
individual SAEs classified by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Proc 
StatXact 5.0 was used to calculate the exact 95% CIs for proportion within a group assuming 
independence between doses and to derive the standardized asymptotic 95% CI for the group 
difference in proportion. The percentage of subjects with at least one solicit /one solicit and one 
unsolicited local adverse event (AE), with at least one solicited/unsolicit general AE and with any 
AE reported during the 7-day solicited follow-up period was tabulated after each vaccine dose and 
overall. The proportion of subjects with at least one new onset chronic disease (NOCD), the 
proportion of subjects with at least one report of unsolicited AE and the haematology and 
biochemistry analysis with the percentage of subjects outside the normal ranges were tabulated.

Demography results: The mean age of the subjects in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 
11.9 years with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.39 years. The population was predominantly of 
South East Asian Heritage (77%) and 23% of subjects were of East Asian Heritage. The 
demographic profiles were similar for both groups (HPV and HAV) with respect to mean age and 
racial distribution. 
• 
Immunogenicity results 
Immunogenicity analyses were performed on the ATP cohort (primary analysis) and on the Total 
vaccinated cohort. The immunogenicity data obtained from both analyses were consistent. 
Seroconversion/ seropositivity rates and GMTs for anti-HPV-16, anti-HPV-18 and anti-HAV 
antibodies by pre-vaccination status for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity are presented in the 
table below.

  Anti-HPV-16  and  anti-HPV-18  antibodies:  At  post-dose  3  in  the  HPV  Group,  100% 
seroconversion rates were observed for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and anti-HPV-18 antibodies 
in initially seronegative subjects, GMTs were high for the anti-HPV-16 antibodies (19619.8 
El.U/mL;  95%  CI:  17188.6;  22394.8)  and  anti-HPV-18  antibodies  (9894.5  El.U/mL;  95% 
CI: 8674.1; 11286.6) at the post-dose 3 time point. Initially seropositive subjects for HPV-
16  and/or  HPV-18  antigens  also  demonstrated 100%  seropositivity  rates  one  month  after 
the third dose of the HPV vaccine, and achieved GMTs that were similar to those subjects 
who were initially seronegative (20778.6 El.U/mL; 95% CI: 13383.8; 32259.2).  
  Anti-HAV  antibodies:  One  month  after  the  third  dose  of  the  HAV  vaccine,  100% 
seroconversion  rates  were  observed  for  anti-HAV  antibodies  in  initially  seronegative 
subjects. The GMTs for these subjects were 1828.0 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1557.6; 2145.3). In 
subjects  who  were  initially  seropositive  for  anti-  HAV,  100%  seropositivity  rates  were 
observed with GMTs of 3363.6 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1801.6; 6279.6).

Safety results 
Any symptom (solicited/unsolicited): During the 30-day post-vaccination period, the incidence 
of any symptom (solicited and unsolicited) tended to be higher in the HPV Group (after 70.7% of 
doses) than in the HAV Group (after 48% of doses). This was due to the higher incidence of local 
symptoms in the HPV Group (after 65% of doses) than in the HAV Group (after 32.1% of doses). 
Grade 3 symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) were reported after 2.7% of doses in the HPV Group 
and after 0.8% of doses in the HAV Group. Reporting of solicited and unsolicited symptoms 
assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination followed a similar pattern (i.e. higher 
incidence in the HPV Group than in the HAV Group).

The most frequent solicited local symptom was pain, after 60.3% HPV doses and 30.4% HAV 
doses. Regarding solicited general symptoms: The general pattern of AE’s were similar for both 
groups except Myalgia. Myalgia was reported more frequently in the HPV Group (after 16.7% of 
doses) than in the HAV Group (after 8.3% of doses), and related to the vaccine respectively after 
9.3% and 3.9%. Other mentioned were headache and fatigue. Unsolicited symptoms reported 
during the 30-day post-vaccination period were similar in incidence, intensity and relationship to 
vaccination between the two groups. Five subjects (3 in the HPV Group and 2 in the HAV Group) 
reported 5 AEs classified as NOCDs (new onset of chronic diseases) according to GSK assessment. 
In both groups, the biochemical and haematological parameters of most of the subjects were 
within the normal ranges One subject reported an SAE: an acute gastroenteritis approximately 
five months after receiving the second dose of HAV vaccine with diarrhoea and abdominal pain 
after a school meal. The event resolved after duration of 10 days and the SAE was assessed by 
the investigator to have no causal relationship to the vaccination. The subject received the third 
vaccine dose and there were no further reports of adverse events. There were no withdrawals due 
to AEs in this study. 
4.  Conclusion 
One month after the third vaccine dose, 100% of subjects who were seronegative at pre-vaccination 
had seroconverted for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens with high GMTs. A similar immune response 
was also elicited in subjects who were seropositive at pre-vaccination.  
All subjects who were initially seronegative in the HAV Group had seroconverted for anti-HAV 
antibodies at the post-dose 3 time point.  
There were no differences observed in adverse event patterns (with respect to the relative frequency 
of different events, duration, relative intensity and reported relationship to vaccination) between 
groups. However, the overall safety profile tended to be higher in the HPV Group than in the HAV 
Group for all the local symptoms. For the general symptoms, the incidence of Myalgia was about 2- 
fold higher in the HPV Group than in the HAV Group, however, there were no reports of Myalgia of 
grade 3 intensity in either group. The incidence of solicited symptoms generally did not increase with 
the number of doses.   
Unsolicited symptoms reported within the 30-day post-vaccination period were similar in incidence, 
intensity and relationship to vaccination between the two groups.  
No differences in incidence rates were identified between groups for any unsolicited symptom classified 
by either the Preferred Term or Primary System Organ Class.   
The incidence and pattern of NOCDs and medically significant conditions were similar in both groups.  
Vaccination did not affect the biochemical and haematological parameters in both groups.  
The reactogenicity results observed for the subset of subjects who received a vaccine that might have 
been exposed to a deviated temperature was similar to those in the other subjects.  
The immunogenicity results observed for the subset of subjects who received a vaccine that might 
have been exposed to a deviated temperature was similar to those in the other subjects.

Clinical expert statement 
GlaxoSmithKline has reviewed the results of this study and has concluded that they have no impact on 
the approved SPS of Cervarix. 
Rapporteur’s conclusion study 104951 
The conclusions of the MAH are endorsed although the effectiveness was not assessed in this study; 
the safety profile of the vaccine seemed to be as expected. The efficacy and safety of the vaccine 
tested in this clinical trial seems to be acceptable. The conclusion of the clinical expert of the MAH can 
also be endorsed; no changes the existing SPC are needed.

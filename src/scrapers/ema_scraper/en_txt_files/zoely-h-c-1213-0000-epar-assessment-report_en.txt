1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Theramex Ireland Limited submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 29 May 2019 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.3.b  
C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or 
PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 
45/46 - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by 
the MAH 
Update of sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add a new contraindication and a new warning 
regarding meningioma, upon request by PRAC following the assessment of Post-authorisation measure “LEG 
014”. The Package Leaflet is being updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to remove 
the list of local representatives from the Package Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The risk of meningioma associated with use of nomegestrol acetate [NOMAC] mono-substance had been 
assessed in the dedicated PSUSA procedure in 2018 following the publication of case-reports of tumor 
shrinkage after drug removal in the literature and an increasing number of cases reported to the Health 
authorities. As a consequence, the product information of the NOMAC-containing products was updated.  
At the same time, the PSUSA for the combination estradiol+NOMAC was being assessed. The evidence was 
not sufficient to propose update of product information at this stage and a LEG procedure had been asked to 
address this issue. The LEG procedure 014 was finalized in March 2019 and the conclusions were to update 
the product information of combination estradiol/NOMAC despite no case-reports of meningioma. The 
scientific grounds for modification included:  
• 
• 
• 
a plausible mechanism of action (dose-effect relationship suspected and use of NOMAC during 
long-period, positive estrogen receptors on meningioma), 
overlapping populations and relatively close doses compared to NOMAC mono-substance,  
relevant case reports with NOMAC alone and with other combinations of estrogens and progestogens 
Therefore, the MAH was asked to submit a type II variation in order to add the risk of meningioma to the 
product information and modifications to the RMP.  
The benefit-risk balance of Zoely, remains positive. 
Following the assessment of the MAH answers, the Product Information is now in line with the LEG 014 
conclusions (see attachment). The RMP has also been updated in order to classify “meningioma” as an 
important potential risk. The MAH provided a Follow-up questionnaire to collect information about 
meningioma cases as required. The MAH has updated the meningioma questionnaire as requested by the 
Assessment report

5.  Introduction 
As part of the PSUSA/00002181/201801 (Nomegestrol monocomponent), the PRAC recommended to 
update the product information with the risk of meningioma associated with nomegestrol use. The sections 
4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet were updated accordingly 
to add a contraindication for the presence or history of meningioma, a warning in this respect and 
meningioma as a rare adverse reaction in products including nomegestrol as single component only. 
This assessment was based on the review of the medically confirmed case reports of meningioma developed 
following long-term treatment during the reporting period (9 case reports from 01 February 2015 to 31 
January 2018) and the previous reporting period (6 cases). Overall, since the first marketing authorisation 
was granted in 1983, 25 cases of meningioma were recorded in the MAH database until 31 January 2018 
(PSUSA/00002181/201801 nomegestrol). Moreover, case-reports of tumour shrinkage after nomegestrol 
withdrawal have been reported (Passeri et al 2019).  
An extrapolation of the risk of meningioma to combinations (estradiol/nomegestrol) was discussed in the 
PSUSA/00002182/201801 (estradiol/nomegestrol). At this stage, although no reports of meningioma were 
received for estradiol/nomegestrol combinations cumulatively a causal relationship between the medicinal 
product and the adverse event was considered at least as a reasonable possibility. Thus, the PRAC has 
requested the MAH of Zoely to submit to EMA, a review of cases of meningioma associated with 
estradiol/nomegestrol use including a discussion on whether the individual dose of each component and 
interactions between oestrogens and progestogens could limit the extrapolation from nomegestrol 
monocomponent to Zoely (estradiol/nomegestrol acetate) in relation to this risk. The MAH has submitted the 
requested information through a LEG procedure for PRAC assessment and subsequently update the Product 
information and RMP via this type II variation.  
6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
Risk management plan: 
Conclusions from the LEG 014 (March 2019): As the risk of meningioma is not yet fully characterized with 
this fixed dose combination and could have an impact of the risk-benefit balance, we are of the opinion that 
this risk should be added in the summary of safety concern of ZOELY involving the use of specific adverse 
reaction follow-up questionnaires to ensure that the information that would be required to confirm the causal 
association are collected if a meningioma was reported (especially the size of the tumour and its evolution if 
the treatment was stopped). The MAH should include the risk of meningioma as an important potential risk 
in the RMP. 
Company response: 
The MAH respectfully proposes to not include meningioma as an important potential risk in the RMP or use 
specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires. 
As per Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP), Module V - Risk Management Systems (Rev 2), the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) should address only the potential risks for which there is scientific evidence to 
suspect the possibility of a causal relationship with the medicinal product, but where there is currently 
insufficient evidence to conclude that this association is causal. Based on the available data, there is 
insufficient scientific evidence to include meningioma as an important potential risk in the RMP. The majority 
of published epidemiologic studies have not found an association between use of oral contraceptives 
(OCs) and risk of meningioma, and there have been no cases of meningioma reported for NOMAC-E2 oral in 
our Company’s global pharmacovigilance database, as indicated above. 
Assessment report  
EMA/283916/2020 
Page 9/22 
  
  
 
 
Furthermore, as there were no meningioma case reports identified for NOMAC-E2 oral, there is limited ability 
to further characterize this risk. 
The risk of meningioma will be adequately described in the NOMAC-E2 oral SmPC and monitored via routine 
pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. As routine PV and risk minimization activities are considered to be 
sufficient and the risk is not associated with any additional risk management activities, the MAH is of the 
opinion that inclusion in the RMP as an important potential risk is not warranted. 
With regard to the request for an event-specific questionnaire, event-specific questionnaires typically have 
very low rate of return. Additionally, as there have been no cases of meningioma reported with the use of 
NOMAC-E2 oral in clinical trials or the post-marketing environment, and given that a follow-up request would 
be made, as part of our Company’s routine PV activities for any meningioma cases which might be received 
in the future, the MAH is of the opinion that the implementation of an event-specific questionnaire would not 
provide additional clinically meaningful information. 
CHMP comment: 
As already discussed in the LEG 014, although no cases were reported, the causal relationship between 
meningioma occurrence and nomegestrol/estradiol intake is considered at least possible. Indeed, ZOELY 
contains 2.5 mg of nomegestrol acetate which is very close to the dosage of the monosubstance (3.75 mg or 
5 mg respectively) and for which cases of meningioma were reported. Moreover, oestrogens seem to 
increase the risk of meningioma as oestrogen receptors have been identified on tumours. Zoely exposure is 
relatively low and the MA is quite recent which can explain the absence of case-reports at this stage.  
However, if cases are reported it would be very interesting to collect the more information as possible to 
better characterize the tumours associated with ZOELY use. Therefore, we consider that a follow-up 
questionnaire dedicated to collect features of meningioma associated with Zoely treatment should be added 
to the pharmacovigilance plan.  
Moreover, as previously said in the LEG assessment report, the risk Management plan should be modified in 
order to include “meningioma” as an important potential risk. Important, because of the risk of meningioma 
could change the benefit-risk of the product. Potential, because the causal relationship has not been firmly 
determined but the risk has been established with medicines containing the same active substance. This is 
in accordance with the GVP module V.  
Therefore, the MAH is asked to update the RMP in accordance with the LEG 014 conclusions and propose a 
follow-up questionnaire to further characterize the risk of meningioma expected with nomegestrol/estradiol 
association.  
7.  PRAC outcome 
The PRAC discussed during its December plenary meeting the CHMP request for PRAC advice on Zoely and 
the need to update the RMP in order to add meningioma as a potential risk and propose a follow-up 
questionnaire to collect relevant data if cases are reported, as recommended in conclusion of the LEG 
procedure 014 in March 2019. 
The PRAC confirmed again that the causal relationship between Zoely and meningioma is considered at least 
possible, especially as there is: a plausible mechanism of action (dose-effect relationship suspected and use 
of NOMAC during long-period, positive estrogen receptors on meningioma); overlapping populations; 
relatively close doses compared to NOMAC mono-substance and relevant case reports with higher doses of 
NOMAC alone and with other combinations of estrogens and progestogens. The Committee has confirmed 
that in view of these arguments, meningioma risk, if confirmed after further assessment, would have an 
Assessment report  
EMA/283916/2020 
Page 10/22 
  
  
 
impact on the risk benefit balance of Zoely. Therefore, meningioma fulfils the criteria of GVP module V 
revision 2 and should be included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
As per GVP module V revision 2, the RMP should focus on the important identified risks that are likely to have 
an impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product. An important identified risk to be included in the RMP 
would usually warrant: 
• Further evaluation as part of the pharmacovigilance plan (e.g. to investigate frequency, severity, 
seriousness and outcome of this risk under normal conditions of use, which populations are particularly at 
risk); 
• Risk minimisation activities: product information advising on specific clinical actions to be taken to 
minimise the risk (see V.B.8.), or additional risk minimisation activities. 
The important potential risks to be included in the RMP are those important potential risks that, 
when further characterised and if confirmed, would have an impact on the risk-benefit balance of the 
medicinal product. Where there is a scientific rationale that an adverse clinical outcome might be 
associated with off-label use, use in populations not studied, or resulting from the long-term use of the 
product, the adverse reaction should be considered a potential risk, and if deemed important, should 
be included in the list of safety concerns as an important potential risk. Important potential risks 
included in the RMP would usually require further evaluation as part of the pharmacovigilance plan. Further 
to the LEG finalised in March 2019, two cases of meningioma were recently reported with Zoely use. These 
two cases provided were not well documented, confirming the need for follow-up questionnaires to collect to 
collect in a structured and comprehensive manner all relevant information on the matter (e.g. treatment 
duration, meningioma localisation, other risk factors). Considering that meningiomas remain a rare tumour, 
the Committee considered that the expected burden is very limited. 
Following the PRAC plenary discussion, the company has confirmed that they will comply to the LEG outcome 
and will provide an updated RMP, as well as a follow-up questionnaire. 
8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH was requested to submit an updated RMP version with this application. After the PRAC advice, the 
MAH committed to submit an updated RMP as well as a follow-up questionnaire to fulfil the LEG conclusions. 
(see section 13). 
After submission of the 3rd responses to questions, the RMP was found to be in line with the LEG 014 
conclusions. Meningioma has been added as an important potential risk. 
8.1.    Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The RMP is approvable.

10.  Request for supplementary information 
10.1.  Major objections 
Clinical aspects 
In line with the conclusions of the LEG 014 procedure, the MAH is requested to update the product 
information.  
RMP aspects 
The MAH is requested to update the RMP in order to add meningioma as a potential risk and propose a 
follow-up questionnaire to collect relevant data if cases are reported. 
11.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information  
Clinical aspects 
Question: In line with the conclusions of the LEG 014 procedure, the MAH is requested to update the 
product information.  
Summary of the MAH’s responses: 
The MAH respectfully maintains that the previously proposed minor editorial changes help to improve patient 
readability and comprehension. For example, the MAH believes that “if you have (or have ever had)” is more 
patient-friendly terminology for “in case of presence or history of”. In addition, the MAH proposal is 
consistent with the current formatting as the bullets of the current text begin with “if you”. The 
MAH-proposed text for “Do not use Zoely” reads as follows:

Rapporteur’s conclusion on MAH answers 21/10/2019:  
The MAH proposals are not considered relevant. The wording has been agreed during the PRAC plenary, in 
March 2019. 
Issue not solved. 
RMP aspects 
Question: The MAH is requested to update the RMP in order to add meningioma as a potential risk and 
propose a follow-up questionnaire to collect relevant data if cases are reported. 
Summary of the MAH’s responses: 
The MAH respectfully reiterates the previous Company’s position and proposes to not include meningioma as 
an important potential risk in the RMP or use specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires. 
The risk of meningioma will be adequately described in the SmPC and Package Leaflet for Zoely as a new 
contraindication and warning/precaution and monitored via routine pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. As 
routine PV and risk minimization activities are considered to be sufficient and the risk is not associated with 
any additional risk management activities, the MAH is of the opinion that inclusion of meningioma in the RMP 
as an important potential risk is not warranted. 
The MAH respectfully considers that scientific data available does not warrant extrapolation of this safety 
concern from nomegestrol monotherapy to NOMAC-E2. Cases of meningioma have been reported for 
nomegestrol monotherapy that is prescribed in higher doses than those used in NOMAC-E2, which is a 
combination product including estradiol / nomegestrol acetate.

The MAH will continue to closely monitor meningioma cases for NOMAC-E2 through routine 
pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. Any potential updates to the RMP in the future shall be considered in the 
event that sufficient scientific evidence to include meningioma as an important potential risk in the RMP is 
identified.  
Event-specific questionnaires typically have a very low rate of return. Additionally, as there is only one case 
of meningioma reported with the use of NOMAC-E2 oral in clinical trials or the post-marketing environment, 
and given that a follow-up request for additional information regarding adverse event reports would be made 
as part of our Company’s routine PV activities for any meningioma case which may be received in the future, 
the MAH proposes that an event-specific questionnaire would not provide additional clinically meaningful 
information. 
The MAH would also like to clarify that the type II variation (EMEA/H/C/001213/II/0051) to update the Risk 
Management Plan for NOMAC-E2 to EU GVP Module V (rev 2) has been submitted to PRAC and is currently 
ongoing. The above justification addressing the request for an RMP update is also being submitted within the 
ongoing variation II-51 in a 2.5 addendum. We respectfully ask that any further requests regarding RMP 
update are addressed within the ongoing II-51 procedure in order to avoid delay in the safety information 
update of the Product Information. 
Rapporteur’s conclusion on MAH answers 21/10/2019:  
The MAH response is unsatisfactory. As previously discussed during PRAC (March 2019): although no case 
of meningioma is reported with ZOELY, a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse 
event is at least a reasonable possibility. In addition, as the risk of meningioma is not yet fully characterized 
with this fixed dose combination and could have an impact of the risk-benefit balance, we are of the opinion 
that this risk should be added in the summary of safety concern of ZOELY involving the use of specific 
adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires to ensure that the information that would be required to confirm 
the causal association are collected if a meningioma was reported (especially the size of the tumour and its 
evolution if the treatment was stopped). 
The MAH should include the risk of meningioma as an important potential risk in the RMP. Considering the 
ongoing type II variation (II 51) about RMP modifications, we do not accept the MAH proposal to discuss the 
safety concerns classification in the frame of this procedure as the current one (II50) is still not approvable 
as the product information has not been updated in line with the LEG 014 conclusions.

13. Assessment of the responses to the 2nd request for 
supplementary information  
Clinical aspects 
Question: In line with the conclusions of the LEG 014 procedure, the MAH is requested to update the 
product information.  
Summary of the MAH’s responses: 
The MAH maintains the same responses as the previous round of assessment. The MAH does not accept to 
update the product information text in line with the one accepted during the PRAC meeting hold in March 
2019.  
Rapporteur’s conclusion on MAH answers 18/11/2019:  
We do not accept this position, as the text is in accordance with the cases reported in the literature with 
nomegestrol mono substance. We agree that “non-cancerous” in maybe a more accurate term to describe 
the tumour, however, as the classification of meningioma according to the grade is not always related to the 
prognosis, we prefer to keep the wording recommended by the PRAC. 
RSI adopted by PRAC: In line with the conclusions of the LEG 014 procedure, the MAH is requested to update 
the product information. The MAH is asked to update the PL, section 2 as follows: 
[…] 
- in case of presence or history of meningioma (generally benign tumour of the tissue located between the 
brain and the skull). In case of doubt contact your doctor. 
[…]  
Meningiomas 
Cases of meningioma (generally benign tumours of the brain) have been reported with prolonged use 
(several years) of nomegestrol monotherapy (without estradiol) at higher doses of 3.75 and 5 mg and more 
(see section ‘When you should not use Zoely’). If a meningioma is diagnosed, treatment with Zoely should 
be stopped. […]

RMP aspects 
Question: The MAH is requested to update the RMP in order to add meningioma as a potential risk and 
propose a follow-up questionnaire to collect relevant data if cases are reported. 
Summary of the MAH’s responses: 
The MAH respectfully reiterates the previous Company’s position and proposes to not include meningioma as 
an important potential risk in the RMP or use specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires. 
The following reasons are moved forward by the MAH: 
•  The risk increases with age such that women using nomegestrol for an indication of HRT are at 
higher risk, of note NOMAC-E2 is indicated for contraception and Nomegestrol mono substance is 
indicated for gynecological disorders and HRT,  
•  nomegestrol monotherapy contains a higher dose (3.75 mg and 5mg) of nomegestrol than 
nomegestrol acetate + 17β-estradiol (NOMAC-E2) (2.5 mg), 
Based on the different indications, target populations, and dosing for the nomegestrol monotherapy 
product as compared to the NOMAC-E2 combination product used for contraception, there is insufficient 
evidence to suggest that the observations regarding meningioma with nomegestrol monotherapy are 
applicable to NOMAC-E2. 
A search performed in the MAH PV database retrieved 2 cases of meningioma (cumulatively from market 
introduction to 15-Oct-2019): 
1) received from a Health Authority and reporting meningioma in a 50-year-old female who started ethinyl 
estradiol (+) levonorgestrel (ADEPAL) in 1999 and switched to nomegestrol acetate (+) estradiol (ZOELY) in 
2009. The patient’s last dose was in February 2019. In May 2019, the patient was diagnosed with a 
meningioma that was reported as recovered with sequelae. No further information was provided in this case.  
=> Of note, NOMAC-E2 (ZOELY) was not marketed in 2009 (marketing authorization was 27JUL2011), 
therefore this case may have been erroneously reported. Due to the insufficient information provided in this 
case, a proper causality assessment is unable to be performed and limited information in the case precludes 
a meaningful medical assessment.  
2) received from the Prospective controlled cohort study on the safety of a monophasic oral contraceptive 
containing nomegestrol acetate (2.5mg) and 17B-estradiol (1.5mg) (PRO-E2) and referring to a 45-year-old 
female who had a history of suicide attempt, and two surgeries prior to study entry for (1) uterine fibroid in 
DEC2015 and (2) anal fistula in JAN2016. There was no history of live births, 1 
miscarriage/stillbirth/abortion and no family history of cancer. Concomitant medications included 
lorazepam, escitalopram, ketazolam, omeprazole, imidapril, probucol, dipyrone and hydroxycobalamin (+) 
pyridoxine (+) thiamine. She began NOMAC-E2 in SEP2016 and the last dose of NOMAC-E2 was taken in 
NOV2017. The patient reported a brain tumor and did not want to provide additional information as “it was 
not related to birth control pills”. In NOV2017, she was diagnosed with grade 1 meningioma. She was 
treated with dexamethasone 10mg and she received 33 treatment sessions of radiotherapy; no surgery or 
chemotherapy was done. The tumor maintained its size with radiotherapy. The investigator considered the 
grade 1 meningioma diagnosed in NOV2017 to be not related to NOMAC-E2.  
Assessment report  
EMA/283916/2020 
Page 17/22 
  
  
 
=> It is noteworthy that this patient has a history of uterine fibroid for which there might be shared risk 
factors with meningioma, however the case provides insufficient information preventing a meaningful 
medical assessment and a proper causality assessment is unable to be performed. Additionally, it was noted 
by both the patient and investigator that the meningioma was not suspected to have been related to 
NOMAC-E2 therapy.  
As per Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP), Module V - Risk Management Systems (Rev 2), the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) should address the potential risks for which there is scientific evidence to 
suspect the possibility of a causal relationship with the medicinal product. Based on the available 
data, there is insufficient scientific evidence to include meningioma as an important potential risk in the 
RMP. The majority of published epidemiologic studies have not found an association between use of oral 
contraceptives (OCs) and risk of meningioma, and as described above, the 2 cases of meningioma reported 
for NOMAC-E2 oral contain insufficient information precluding causality assessment.  
The risk of meningioma will be adequately described in the SmPC and Package Leaflet for Zoely as a new 
contraindication and warning/precaution and monitored via routine pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. As 
routine PV and risk minimization activities are sufficient and the risk is not associated with any 
additional risk minimization activities or additional pharmacovigilance activities, the MAH is of the opinion 
that inclusion of meningioma in the RMP as an important potential risk is not warranted. 
The MAH respectfully considers that scientific data available does not warrant extrapolation of this safety 
concern from nomegestrol monotherapy to NOMAC-E2. Cases of meningioma have been reported for 
nomegestrol monotherapy that is prescribed in higher doses than those used in NOMAC-E2, which is a 
combination product including estradiol / nomegestrol acetate. 
Event-specific questionnaires typically have a very low rate of return. Additionally, as there are only 
two cases of meningioma reported with the use of NOMAC-E2 oral in clinical trials or the post-marketing 
environment, and given that a follow-up request for additional information regarding adverse event reports 
would be made as part of our Company’s routine PV activities for any meningioma case which may be 
received in the future, the MAH proposes that an event-specific questionnaire would not provide additional 
clinically meaningful information. 
The MAH will continue to monitor meningioma cases for NOMAC-E2 through routine 
pharmacovigilance (PV) activities. Any potential updates to the RMP in the future shall be considered in 
the event that sufficient scientific evidence to include meningioma as an important potential risk in the RMP 
is identified. 
Rapporteur’s conclusion on MAH answers 18/11/2019:  
We still support the PRAC recommendation to update the RMP in order to mention the potential 
risk  of  meningioma  associated  with  noemegstrol/estradiol  use and  to  implement  specific  adverse 
reaction follow-up questionnaires.  
During the PRAC discussion, apart from the addition of the risk of meningioma (4.3 and 4.4) to the product 
information,  the  update  of  the  RMP  in  order  to  mention  the  potential  risk  of  meningioma  was  explicitly 
supported  by  three  MS  and  was  consensual  (and  is  not  precluded  by  GVP  V).  With  respect  to  the 
classification as a potential risk, it was considered by PRAC that a causal relationship between the medicinal 
Assessment report  
EMA/283916/2020 
Page 18/22 
  
  
 
 
 
product and the occurrence of a meningioma could be a possibility. It was also considered that section 4.8 
should not yet be updated, waiting for further evidence as no case had been reported (hence, it was not 
classified as identified). The GVP V states that potential risks when further characterized and if confirmed 
would have an impact on the benefit risk balance of the product. Meningioma risk characterization would 
surely have an impact on the BR ratio.   
Furthermore, two cases have been identified since.  
Regarding the first case, we agree that the information is quite limited and that the reported time to onset 
is not suggestive of a role of Zoely. However, the worsening of a pre-existing meningioma by nomegestrol 
exposure cannot be excluded. 
Please find below more details as described in the other case report:  
The  patient  a  woman  of  50  years  old,  with  no  particular  medical  history,  took  ADEPAL 
(Levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol) for 10 years for contraception (from 1999 to 2009). She took Zoely for 10 
years from 2009 (more probably 2011 as Zoely has been marketed from 2011 in France) to February 2019. 
After each pregnancy (parity and date unknown) she took Minidril (levonorgestrel). Sometimes the patient 
experiences hypoesthesic symptoms in the trigeminal nerve area (right V2) and has no other symptoms. On 
the 16/05/2019, this patient is seen in consultation of neurosurgery following the discovery of a meningioma 
of the right ponto-cerebellar angle, in a context of hypoesthesia of the right lip in its lower part. Given the 
size of this meningioma which remains small, but if it is in contact with the nerve trigeminal, resulting in a 
little  uncomfortable  hypoesthesia  in  daily  life,  it  is  reasonable  to  initially  provide  for  surveillance.  In  the 
event  of  increased  discomfort  or  significant  increase  in  volume,  it  will  be  necessary  to  proceed  to  a 
treatment. This case has been medically confirmed. 
The MAH highlights that, indeed, Zoely was not marketed before 2011. Although there might be a mistake 
in the date reported (did the patient state they started Zoely about ten years ago?), it seems unlikely that 
there would be a mistake about having taken Zoely for several years.  
The  MAH  also  notes  that  they  would  have  liked  to  have  more  information  to  perform  a  proper  causality 
assessment. This observation is shared by the Rapporteur, however it is noted that if the MAH had complied 
with the PRAC recommendation after the LEG assessment, valuable information might already have been 
collected. 
Issue not solved. 
Further, it should be noted that this case highlights the importance of implementing without delay a 
follow-up questionnaire in this particular situation. Indeed, FUQ are especially useful in situations where 
structured and comprehensive information is necessary to conclude on the causality of a suspected risk. For 
example, although the MAH stated that FUQ would not provide additional clinically meaningful information 
compared to what they will collect in the future, the occurrence of several pregnancies (which is also a risk 
factor for meningiomas) was not deepened by the MAH, nor the chronology of the meningioma, nor the 
evolution after the treatment was stopped. The internal policy of the MAH for data collection might also not 
reflect the experience accumulated by PRAC for assessing the causality of meningioma on other products. 
Finally, as stated by the MAH, this risk is rare and only two cases were collected: it is thus expected that the 
potential burden on HCPs will be neglectable. To ensure that the FUQ are not maintained longer than 
required, the Rapporteur will analyze in each PSUSA whether there is still a need for this FUQ.

Summary of the MAH’s responses: 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has reviewed the comments provided in the assessment report 
for the follow-up questionnaire (FUQ) and updated the FUQ accordingly where appropriate. The MAH 
respectfully notes that the previously proposed Annex 4 contained all event-specific questionnaires in use for 
nomegestrol acetate + 17β-estradiol (NOMAC-E2) [venous thromboembolic events (VTE), arterial 
thromboembolism events (ATE) and meningioma]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/283916/2020 
Page 21/22 
  
  
 
 
 
The FUQ for meningioma provided in the previously proposed Annex 4 of the European Union (EU) Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) contained the full questionnaire package proposed for dissemination when 
requesting follow-up information in response to the receipt of reports with an event of meningioma. This 
package included the cover letter, drug adverse experience report questionnaire, and targeted 
event-specific questionnaire for meningioma.  
The drug adverse experience report is a general questionnaire form disseminated for all cases reported for 
all MAH products to follow-up on all reported events. The drug adverse experience report is not specific to 
the FUQ for meningioma; however, it will be provided combined with the FUQ for meningioma as a case of 
meningioma may report more than one event, one or more of which may be unrelated to meningioma. 
Therefore, updates to the drug adverse experience report questionnaire are unable to be accommodated. 
The drug adverse experience report questionnaire has been removed from the previously proposed 
meningioma FUQ included in Annex 4. The MAH confirms that the drug adverse experience report 
questionnaire will still be disseminated as a separate document, alongside the updated meningioma specific 
FUQ included in the newly proposed Annex 4. 
In regard to the suggested modifications to the event-specific questionnaire for meningioma, the MAH 
agrees with the proposed updates and has modified the FUQ accordingly. The MAH will continue to monitor 
all cases of meningioma reported through routine pharmacovigilance. 
Rapporteur’s conclusion on MAH answers 03/04/2020: 
The MAH has updated the Meningioma questionnaire accordingly to the Rapporteurs comments. The general 
form sent for additional information has not been updated as it is common for all types of ADRs. This is 
agreed.

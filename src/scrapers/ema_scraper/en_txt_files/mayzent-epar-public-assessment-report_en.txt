2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory condition that causes neuro-axonal 
injury in the Central Nervous System (CNS) leading to permanent and severe neurological impairment 
and  disability.  The  most  common  onset  MS  form  (relapsing-remitting  MS,  RRMS)  is  characterised  by 
acute episodes of neurological dysfunction named relapses followed by variable recovery and periods of 
clinical  stability.  There  are  different  authorised  disease  modifying  therapies  (DMT)  for  patients  with 
RRMS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 9/163 
 
  
 
 
 
More than 50% of patients who suffer from a RRMS will within a median time of 15 to 20 years from 
onset, develop a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) characterized by sustained disability 
with or without superimposed relapses.  
With  the  present  application,  the  applicant  initially  intended  to  seek  approval  of  siponimod  for  the 
following indication: 
“Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(SPMS).” 
During the evaluation of the data and after Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) Neurology, the applicant has 
revised the proposed indication to:  
Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MS is the most common cause of serious neurological disability in young adults. It is estimated that 
more than 2.3 million people are affected by MS worldwide. The prevalence of MS is highest in North 
America and Europe (140 and 108 per 100,000 respectively) and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and 
East Asia at 2.1 and 2.2 per 100,000, respectively. MS typically starts between 20 to 40 years of age. 
Overall, women are affected approximately twice as often as men, except in individuals with the 
primary-progressive MS (PPMS), where there is no gender prevalence difference. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact cause of MS is unknown, it is assumed that MS is mediated by an autoimmune process 
triggered by an infection or other environmental factors, superimposed on a genetic predisposition.  
The major contributors to this process are macrophages and microglia from the innate immune system, 
and  T  and  B  lymphocytes  from  the  adaptive  immune  system.  From  the  peripheral  immune  system, 
autoreactive  T-helper  cells  are  primed  and  stimulated  to  infiltrate  the  CNS  where  they  target  myelin 
antigens.  Inflammation  of  the  white  and  grey  matter  tissues  in  the  CNS  due  to  focal  immune  cell 
infiltration and release of cytokines are the incipient cause of tissue damage in MS not only to the myelin 
sheath but also to the underlying axons. This process happens over time and results in repeated attacks 
(clinically eloquent or not). During the acute phase, demyelination and inflammation impair or interrupts 
nerve  transmission,  giving  rise  to  clinical  signs  and  symptoms.  Relapses  are  considered  the  clinical 
expression of acute inflammatory focal lesions. Afterwards, remaining permanent symptoms (sequelae) 
are due to permanent neuro-axonal loss or permanent injured and demyelinated neurons. 
Elements  from  both  adaptive  (B  and  T  cells)  and  innate  (monocytes,  natural killer  cells  and  dendritic 
cells) immune systems all are involved in any stage of MS. During the RRMS phase, the accumulation of 
disability  (disability  worsening  or  progression)  is  mostly  due  to  lack  of  complete  recovery  of  focal 
inflammatory lesions. In the SPMP phase, accumulation of disability is explained by the conjunction of 
pathological  mechanisms  including  focal  inflammatory  activity  (particularly  relevant  in  SPMS  with 
relapses  and  acute  lesions)  and  failure  of  biological  compensation  of  the  CNS  damage  (impaired 
remyelination and lack of biological redundancy).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The most commonly onset MS phenotype (85% of patients) is RRMS clinically characterized by relapses. 
Nearly half of the RRMS patients will develop within 20 years a SPMS clinically characterized by disability 
Assessment report

Page 10/163 
 
  
worsening.  There  are  no  clear  criteria  that  mark  the  transition  from  RRMS  to  SPMS.  The  transition  is 
determined retrospectively based on evidence that disability progression had occurred independently of 
relapses, though relapses and focal inflammatory activity may continue to be present. In fact, the SPMS 
is a heterogeneous population including patients with relapses (usually with a prominent development 
of  T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated  Inversion  Recovery  (T2-FLAIR)  lesions)  and  other  patients  without 
relapses. The term "relapsing MS" (RMS) applies to those affected patients either with a RRMS or SPMS 
with  superimposed  relapses.  The  pathological  mechanism  underlying  relapses  and  typical  radiological 
T2-FLAIR  lesions  is  acute  focal  inflammatory  activity.  Regardless  of  other  potential  pathological 
mechanisms, lack of complete recovery from focal inflammatory lesion causes accumulation of disability. 
Therefore, patients with relapsing MS, despite suffering from different MS forms, constitute a common 
target for current treatment options.  
Clinical  manifestations  in  RRMS  may  depend  on  affected  CNS  regions.  In  SPMS,  accumulated  CNS 
damage is usually presented as reduced ambulation and cognitive impairment, bulbar dysfunction, visual 
impairment, impaired arm function, fatigue, pain and depression and sphincter control issues. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The  standard  of  care  for  acute  relapses  is  methylprednisolone  i.v.  Methylprednisolone  shortens  the 
duration of a relapse but has no influence on its sequelae. Plasmapheresis may improve recovery from 
relapse in steroid-resistant cases, but this is rarely used. 
Disease-modifying therapies (DMT) aim to modify the course of the disease by suppressing or modulating 
the  immune  responses  involved  in  MS  pathogenesis.  Biologicals  (therapeutic  proteins,  monoclonal 
antibodies) and small molecules have been approved for use in this therapeutic context. DMTs aim to 
prevent relapses and ultimately intend to decrease the rate of accumulation of disability. Due to the risks 
(identified  or  potential)  of  opportunistic  infections,  malignancies,  and  other  systemic  adverse  drug 
reactions,  several  of  these  treatment  options  are  considered  as  second-line  options  i.e.  treatment  is 
restricted to patients with rapidly evolving multiple sclerosis or those who had a suboptimal response to 
prior therapies. 
Currently 12 DMTs are available (country/regional differences exist) for the treatment of MS (interferon 
beta-1a  and  interferon  beta-1b,  peginterferon  beta-1a,  glatiramer  acetate,  fingolimod,  natalizumab, 
teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, cladribine, and mitoxantrone). Most are 
approved for RRMS or relapsing forms of MS (RMS, defined as RRMS and SPMS with relapses). Products 
for both RRMS and RMS were approved based on treatment effect on relapses, MRI lesion activity, and, 
some for the delay in disability worsening.  
Interferon beta (IFNB)-1b is approved in the EU for patients with SPMS with active disease as 
evidenced by relapses. The two trials in SPMS presented as efficacy data for marketing authorization 
showed a consistent 30% reduction in frequency of relapses and inconsistent results for the primary 
endpoint “time to confirmed progression”(31% reduction in time to disability progression in one trial 
and no significant delay in the other trial including patients with overall less active disease than in the 
other study).  
About the product 
Siponimod is a selective modulator of G-protein coupled sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) and S1P5 
receptors, leading to internalization and degradation of S1P1 receptors on T and B-lymphocytes, which 
prevents their egress and recirculation from secondary lymphatic tissue to target organs including the 
CNS. Siponimod is designed not to target the S1P3 and S1P4 receptors at pharmacological doses, in 
contrast to fingolimod (which targets S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 11/163 
 
  
Siponimod acts in the periphery to impede egress of peripheral lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid 
organs and prevent pathogenic effector lymphocyte recirculation from lymphatic tissue to the CNS. 
The  initially  claimed  indication  was  “treatment  of  secondary  progressive  multiple  sclerosis  in  adults”. 
After receiving scientific assessment of efficacy data by CHMP and considering the report from The SAG 
Neurology, the applicant has revised the proposed indication to:  
Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity 
Based on pharmacodynamic data of Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery dynamics and the half-
life of approximately 30 h, a once-daily dosing regimen was proposed to be adequate to maintain an 
effective absolute lymphocyte count reduction. 
Type of Application and aspects on development

General information 
The chemical name of siponimod fumaric acid is (2E)-but-2-enedioic acid 1-({4-[(1E)-N-{[4-
cyclohexyl-3-(trifluoro)phenyl]methoxy}ethanimidoyl]-2-ethylphenyl}methyl)azetidine-3-carboxylic 
acid (1:2) corresponding to the molecular formula C62H74F6N4O10 (i.e. 2 molecules of siponimod for 
every 1 molecule of fumaric acid). It has a relative molecular mass of 1149.29 g/mol and the following 
structure:

Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of siponimod fumaric acid was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic and 
other analytical methods and the active substance is considered appropriately characterized. This data 
indicates that the active substance is not a fumarate salt but rather, siponimod exists as a co-crystal 
with fumaric acid as the co-former. 
The active substance is a white to almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, which is insoluble 
in aqueous solutions below pH 7 and very slightly soluble above pH 7.5 and in simulated intestinal 
fluid. It is not very soluble in many organic solvents either.  
Siponimod is achiral but contains an oxime double bond with E-configuration, which is the desired and 
thermodynamically favoured isomer.  
Polymorphism has been observed for siponimod fumaric acid. Only one form, the most 
thermodynamically stable, is selected for commerical manufacturing. A test for polymorphic form by 
XRPD is included in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Siponimod fumaric acid is chemically synthesized in convergent fashion from three well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications. The choice of starting materials is in line with 
previously provided scientific advice. There are multiple chemical transformation and isolation steps 
between each starting material and the active substance.  
Critical steps of the process have been defined, and the applied controls are considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
All potential impurities were assessed for potential mutagenicity in silico according to ICH M7.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Several changes have been implemented along the way to improve 
process safety, increase yields, improve the quality of the active substance, and allow for scale-up. 
Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.

The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  polyethylene  (PE)  bags,  which  comply  with  the  EC  regulation 
10/2011 as amended. The bags are further stored within PE/OPA/alu/PET bags stored inside drums. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), particle size (laser 
diffraction), clarity and colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, XRPD), related substances (HPLC and 
IC), residual solvents (GC),  specific impurities (XRF and polarography), water content (KF), heavy 
metals (ICP-MS), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), , assay of siponimod (HPLC), assay of fumaric acid (titration) 
and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications 
have been set. Particle size limits have been set in line with the batches used in phase III clinical 
studies.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 18 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications applicable at the time and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from a different manufacturing 
site in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH), up to 24 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Further data 
on three batches of active substance manufactured at the proposed commercial site were also provided 
(up to 9 months under intermediate conditions, up to 6 months under accelerated conditions). The 
following parameters were tested: appearance, particle size, clarity and colour of solution, identity, 
related substances, water content, assay and microbiology. No trends to any of the measured 
parameters were observed and all remained within specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No degradation or 
untoward trends were observed, indicating that siponimod fumaric acid is not photosensitive. 
Results under stressed conditions (water, aqueous acid, aqueous base, aqueous peroxide, all 80 oC) 
indicate that siponimod fumaric acid is susceptible to hydrolysis, especially in alkaline media, so it is 
recommended to protect the active substance from water. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months in the proposed 
airtight container in order to protect the active substance from water.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing either 0.25 mg or 2 mg of 
siponimod. The tablets are distinguished by colour (0.25 mg: pale red; 2 mg, pale yellow) and 
debossing. 
Siponimod fumaric acid is a BCS class II compound with good absorption characteristics but practically 
insoluble in aqueous media, although solubility increases slightly at low pH or above pH 6.8. The 
particle size distribution has been set in line with phase III clinical batches and affords sufficiently 
stable active substance. 
Development started with a hard gelatin capsule containing the active substance and standard 
pharmacopoeial excipients, formulated by wet granulation. However, the results of dose range finding 
studies indicated the need for much lower doses of active substance.  As a result, a tablet formulation 
was developed using common pharmaceutical processing. The excipients chosen for the tablet 
formulation are also well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards where appropriate. Suitable specifications have been provided for the non-pharmacopoeial 
film-coating pre-mixes. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list 
of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Compatibility 
with the excipients was investigated using binary mixtures stored at elevated temperature and 
humidity. No incompatibilities were observed with those excipients in the proposed commercial 
formulation. 
Development of the dissolution method has been described. The method has been shown to be 
discriminatory and suitable limits have been included in the specification. 
The manufacturing process consists of combining the active substance and excipients, tableting and 
film-coating steps. The commercial process was established by optimizing the different unit operations 
at pilot and commercial scaleThe primary packaging is PA/alu/PVC/alu blisters. The materials comply 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  blending  and  screening  of  the  active  substance  and  excipients; 
tableting;  film-coating;  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing 
process given the low active substance content. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three consecutive commercial scale 
batches  of  each  strength  according  to  the  process  description.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  pharmaceutical 
form. The critical steps have been defined.  
A bulk holding study was carried out on two batches of each strength of film-coated tablet and a bulk 
hold time of up to 12 months under refrigerated conditions has been justified.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance  (visual),  mean  mass,  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  loss  on  drying  (halogen  drying),  dissolution 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), degradation products (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbial 
enumeration (Ph. Eur.).  
The  testing  monographs  contain  statements  about  changing  analytical  equipment  and  sample 
preparation within validated ranges. These were introduced in response to questions from regulators in 
other  regions.  However,  these  are  considered  to  fall  under  GMP  and  the  CHMP  has  recommended 
removing  the statements from the dossier by variation, post-approval. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based  approach  in  line  with  the  ICH  Q3D  Guideline  for  Elemental  Impurities.  The  risk  from  different 
potential  sources  was  considered  and  deemed  to  be  negligible.  Testing  of  finished  product  batches 
indicated that all elemental impurities were well below the relevant thresholds and thus, no additional 
controls are required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for nine commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, 
through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of each strength were generated according to the ICH 
guidelines. Samples were stored under a series of conditions and for variable durations: at either -20 oC 
or 40 oC/75% RH for up to 6 months; at 5 oC, 25 oC/60% RH, 30 oC/65% RH and 30 oC/75% RH for up 
to 24 months. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for  appearance, 
dissolution, assay, degradation products, loss on drying and microbial enumeration. Tablet hardness was 
also monitored. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Under refrigerated conditions, no significant changes were observed for any of the measured parameters. 
At  25  oC,  a  small  increase  in  degradation  products  and  drop  in  assay  was  observed.  The  amount  of 
degradation was greater at higher temperatures and humidities It was deemed that a small increase in 
degradation  and  reduction  in  assay  was  acceptable  to  allow  patients  to  store  tablets  in  a  more 
conventional fashion, i.e. at ambient temperature rather than in the refrigerator.  
In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product was not found to be 
photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months stored not above 25 oC as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
 Identified  remarks  should  be  removed  from  the  finished  product  testing  monographs  as  it  is  part  of 
GMP. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  nonclinical  development  program  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  International  Conference  for 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidance in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
mutual acceptance of data (MAD) compliant member state. 
The nonclinical toxicology program was conducted under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), with all pivotal 
toxicity (including safety pharmacology) studies being GLP compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Siponimod has been developed as a S1P modulator for the treatment of adult patients with secondary 
progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). As an immunomodulatory agent it functions to sequester T and B 
lymphocytes  within  the  secondary  lymphoid  organs  and  aims  to  ameliorate  MS  sequelae  by  reducing 
peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) counts. The basis for its use for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is 
built on the prototype S1P-modulator, fingolimod.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Siponimod selectively targets S1P1 and S1P5 receptors  
Initial in vitro experiments were performed to characterise the specificity of siponimod for the various 
S1P receptors. In [35S]GTPγS-binding assays using chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 17/163 
 
  
 
individually S1P1 to S1P5, siponimod was a much more selective agonist at S1P1 and S1P5 receptors 
with EC50 values more than 750-fold below concentrations at S1P2, S1P3 and S1P4 subtypes.  
In  addition  to  the  parent  compound  siponimod,  the  binding  activity  of  several  metabolites  was  also 
investigated.  Concerning  the  major  human  metabolites,  M3  was  pharmacologically  inactive  in  S1P1 
expressing cells, whereas M17 was ~80- and 70-fold less potent than its parent compound siponimod at 
S1P1  and  S1P5  receptors  suggesting  that  M17  is  unlikely  to  be  contributing  to  the  pharmacological 
activity. 
Siponimod exerts “functional antagonism” at S1P1 receptors, but acts as agonist at the S1P5 subtype 
The  binding  of  siponimod  concentration-dependently  promoted  long-lasting  internalization  and 
degradation of S1P1 receptors (“functional antagonism”) as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis in 
CHO  cells  expressing  a  Myc-tagged  S1P1  receptor.  Comparison  was  made  with  the  approved  S1P 
modulator,  fingolimod,  which  was  shown  to  be  marginally  more  efficient  at  inducing  receptor 
internalisation. In contrast, siponimod is thought to function as an agonist for S1P5 as it failed to induce 
internalisation of S1P5 receptors up to the highest concentration of 1 µM, which is in line with the S1P 
modulator fingolimod.  
Siponimod slows lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes (LN) and their recirculation to the CNS 
In  vivo  siponimod  transiently  decreased  PBL  counts  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  following  single 
administration  in  healthy  rats  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.  In  various  severe  protracted  and  chronic 
progressive  experimental  autoimmune  encephalitis  (EAE)  models  of  human  MS  in  rats  and  mice, 
siponimod similarly decreased PBLs at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg in rats and 3 mg/kg in mice, which correlated 
with  effective  reversal  of  neurological  deficits,  and  decreased  inflammation  (reduced  macrophage 
infiltration, activated microglia) as well as demyelination. At the effective doses the brain to plasma ratio 
of siponimod exposure was approximately 5-fold. Siponimod doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day or below were less 
efficacious when administered during early EAE in rats compared to higher dose levels. In another EAE 
model  in  mice,  continuous  intracerebroventricular  infusions  of  ≥0.45 µg/day  siponimod  diminished 
activation of astrocytes and microglia, reduced infiltration of CD3+ lymphocytes and restored GABAergic 
neurotransmission in the striatum.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Siponimod and its metabolites M3, M16 and M17 did not show any clinically relevant “off-target” affinity 
in  receptor  interaction  screens  in vitro.  However,  oral  siponimod  doses  of  0.03-30 mg/kg  promoted 
significant dose-dependent permeation of Evans blue dye into the lungs of mice, which is in line with the 
role of the S1P1 receptor in the maintenance of endothelial vascular integrity. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacological effects of siponimod on cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS function were tested 
in  four  GLP  compliant  safety  pharmacology  studies  in  accordance  with  ICH S7A  and  7B  guidelines 
(CPMP/ICH/539/00, CPMP/ICH/423/02). These investigations were complemented by an extensive non-
GLP cardiovascular safety pharmacology package, primarily driven by the findings seen with fingolimod 
where treatment of some patients was associated with transient effects on heart rate, atrioventricular 
conduction and in some instances decreased blood pressure. Siponimod did neither significantly affect 
hERG currents in vitro, nor the QT interval in conscious telemetered guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys 
in vivo. However, siponimod decreased the heart rate in the rabbit Langendorff heart model ex vivo and 
also  induced  bradycardia  in  association  with  atrioventricular  (AV)  dissociation  and  second-degree  AV 
block in rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and monkeys in vivo. This inhibition of AV conduction and heart rate 
is also known from non-clinical and clinical experience with fingolimod and is mechanistically related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 18/163 
 
  
the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, which were found to 
be comparably stimulated by siponimod and fingolimod in guinea pig atrial cardiomyocytes (EC50 values 
of 15.8 nM and 10.6 nM, respectively). Remarkably, siponimod re-challenge did not alter AV conduction 
and heart rate in guinea pigs or monkeys in vivo, which was confirmed during re-incubations of atrial 
cardiomyocytes  with  either  siponimod  or  fingolimod  after  an  interim  washout  period  in vitro.  This 
desensitisation  of  GIRK  channels  is  apparently  related  to  the  downregulation  of  S1P  receptors  during 
prolonged  exposure  of  siponimod  or  fingolimod,  since  GIRK  channels  could  still  be  activated  by  the 
acetylcholine analogue carbachol via muscarinic M2 receptors. Thus, siponimod and fingolimod initially 
act  as  agonists  at  S1P1  receptors  to  inhibit  AV  conduction  via  stimulation  of  GIRK  currents  and 
subsequently  as  functional  antagonists  by  down-regulation  of  S1P1  receptors,  which  interferes  with 
continuous GIRK channel activation and resolves AV conduction abnormalities. 
No effects on the CNS were seen using the Irwin test in rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg.  
In respiratory studies siponimod was associated with slight increases in the tidal volume from baseline. 
Because in parallel this was associated with slight decreases in the respiratory rate of up to 22%, overall 
the minute volume was unaffected.  
Overall the provided pharmacology package is sufficient to support the MAA of Mayzent. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies addressing drug interactions were not performed. This approach is 
endorsed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of siponimod were investigated after single oral or i.v. doses in mouse, rat 
and Cynomolgus monkey and following multiple administrations in repeated-dose toxicity studies of the 
three species, with PK values derived utilising total radioactivity following administration of C14-labelled 
siponimod and via direct siponimod concentration analysis in plasma, blood and relevant tissue matrices. 
In  addition,  toxicokinetic  determinations  were  performed  in  pregnant  rabbits  upon  oral  or  i.v. 
administrations, respectively. 
Analytical  methods  were  appropriately  validated  in  line  with  the  pertinent  European  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1 Corr. 2**) and were therefore accepted, although validations did 
not achieve full GLP compliance. 
Following oral administration siponimod absorption was slow to medium with tmax values of between 2-
8 hours for all species. Oral bioavailability was 49-52% in rat and up to 83% in monkey. The plasma t1/2 
of siponimod was relatively long and followed two-compartmental kinetics in monkeys and humans with 
t1/2α of 16-19 h and 27 h, respectively. A shorter t1/2β of 5-6 h was observed in male rats, whereas one-
compartmental  kinetics  were  noted  in  female  rats  and  in  mice.  Significant  sex-related  differences  in 
exposure were only evident in the rat after single and repeat doses due to substantially lower plasma 
clearance  in  females  (0.074 l/(h·kg))  compared  to  males  (0.4-0.5 l/(h·kg)).  Exposure  increased  in  a 
slightly sub-dose proportional manner following oral administration in non-clinical species. There was no 
notable accumulation following multiple dosing evident in rat or mouse studies with mild accumulation 
in monkey studies (≈1.4-3.0 based on Area Under the Curve (AUC)).  
Siponimod  was  highly  plasma  protein  bound  (>99%)  in  all  species  tested.  Quantitative  whole-body 
autoradiography tissue distribution studies in mice and rats revealed extensive distribution of siponimod 
related radioactivity (i.e. siponimod and/or metabolites) following a single oral dose with the lacrimal 
gland the highest exposed tissue in mouse followed by liver, kidney (cortex and corticomedullar junction) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 19/163 
 
  
and lymph nodes. In rat, highest and longest lasting radioactivity levels were found in the adrenal cortex, 
myelin (represented by the nerves, cerebellar white matter and white spinal cord) and testis.  
Radioactively labelled siponimod was additionally detectable in the ciliary body, choroid, lens and vitreous 
body of the eye of albino mice and could be traced in the lens until 271 h post dosing. In pigmented rats, 
radioactive components were also confirmed in the choroid at ~2.5-fold higher levels than in albino rats 
and  were  eliminated  at  168  h  after  oral  administration.  Therefore,  the  photo-reactive  potential  of 
siponimod was evaluated in a 3T3 NRU assay in vitro. 
Brain concentrations of siponimod were assessed in all repeat-dose toxicity studies confirming extensive 
distribution to the CNS with brain concentrations of 5-16 times those in plasma reported. The unbound 
AUC of siponimod in the brain at the respective no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) and at the 
human equivalent oral dose of 2 mg was 1.31 nM·h in female rats, 0.64 nM·h and 0.49 nM·h in female 
and male monkeys and 0.22 nM·h in male rats and humans. The unbound Cmax was 0.066 nM in female 
rats, 0.34 nM and 0.028 nM in female and male monkeys, 0.15 nM in male rats and 0.012 nM in humans. 
All tissues analysed in non-clinical species exhibited several fold higher concentrations of siponimod than 
plasma. 
Siponimod crossed the placenta in rabbits and was present in foetal plasma in the rabbit embryo-foetal 
development  study  at  concentrations  between  1.6-2.6  times  the  maternal  plasma  concentration. 
Siponimod-related  radioactivity  was  also  secreted  into  the  milk  of  lactating  rats  at  concentrations 
approximately half of those determined in maternal plasma. 
Siponimod undergoes extensive metabolism in vivo. Hydroxylation is the primary elimination pathway 
followed  by  sulfation  and  glucuronidation.  No  studies  examining  affinity,  induction  or  inhibition  of 
cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes have been presented in the non-clinical section of the dossier but are 
included in clinical section of the dossier. In vitro studies suggest CYP2C9 is the predominant cytochrome 
P450  isoenzyme  in  the  hepatic  biotransformation  of  siponimod  (79.3%)  with  a  minor  contribution  of 
CYP3A4  (18.5%).  The  two  major  human  metabolites  were  identified  as  metabolite  M3  (produced  via 
hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation) and M17 (cholesterol ester metabolite). The applicant states 
that adequate levels of M3 and M17 for toxicological evaluation were observed in monkey and mouse 
studies, respectively. It should be noted that these metabolites were not measured directly in TK samples 
acquired  in  the  pivotal  toxicity  studies  but  instead  levels  have  been  calculated  based  on  siponimod 
exposure and the ratio of the relevant metabolites to parent observed in non-pivotal (non-GLP) PK and 
exploratory studies. This approach was adopted as M3 and M17 were identified after the completion of 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies at which time retention samples from those studies were no longer 
available. It should be noted that full method validation for the assay used in the quantification of each 
of these metabolites was not conducted. However, adequate justification was provided that this does not 
significantly affect the interpretation of these data and, given the relatively large margins of exposure 
between calculated metabolite concentration in non-clinical species and those observed clinically, it is 
accepted that their safety has been adequately qualified in pivotal non-clinical studies. 
Like siponimod, M17 is highly plasma protein bound and exhibits wide tissue distribution. M17 shows 
significant accumulation in plasma and tissues following multiple dosing with kidney and liver exhibiting 
the highest concentrations following 39-week administration to mice. M3 was detected in the monkey 
absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  (ADME)  study,  based  on  this  study,  exposure 
margins at the NOAEL in the monkey repeat-dose toxicity study to human exposures are adequate.  
Elimination  of  siponimod  in  non-clinical  species  is  primarily  via  biliary/faecal  excretion  of  the  sulfate 
conjugate M4 and the hydroxylation metabolites M5, M6 and M7 in all species. Unchanged siponimod 
represented  only  ~8-9 %  of  the  administered  dose  in  the  bile  or  faeces  of  bile  duct-cannulated  rats, 
monkeys and humans. Excretion of unchanged siponimod into urine was not detected or only in traces 
across all species tested.   Higher levels up to 21.5 % of unchanged siponimod were solely determined 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 20/163 
 
  
in faeces of mice. Compared to rats and monkeys, mice showed extended elimination of siponimod from 
tissues. 
PK drug-drug interactions 
There is limited non-clinical PK data presented related to the potential for PK interactions. An extensive 
set of in vitro studies investigating the potential for siponimod and metabolites M3 and M17 mediated 
DDI at efflux and uptake transporters do not suggest a significant risk at exposures anticipated with 
the proposed clinical posology (see clinical section). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  line  with  ICH  M3  (R1)  requirements  with  rats  and 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  used  as  the  species  of  investigation  for  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies.  In 
addition, studies were performed in mice and rabbits. These species are pharmacologically relevant for 
the assessment of the safety of siponimod. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose GLP compliant studies were performed in mice and rats as well as a non-GLP compliant 
study in monkeys. In mice, no siponimod related findings were evident following i.v. administration of 
doses of up to 200 mg/kg. Rats were dosed orally up to 2000 mg/kg with some females in the 2000 
mg/kg group exhibiting mild adverse effects including piloerection, decreased body tone and abnormal 
gait. In monkeys, oral doses up to 60 mg/kg were generally well tolerated. Lymphopenia was seen in 
line with the pharmacological action of siponimod as well as mild prolongation of activated partial 
thromboplastin time. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Siponimod induced marked to severe lymphopenia in all animal species, which was related to its 
primary pharmacodynamic activity at S1P receptors and consequently not considered for the 
determination of NOAELs. As a compensatory mechanism, myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow and 
extramedullary haematopoiesis were noted. The lymphocyte reductions manifested in dose-dependent 
atrophy in the white pulp of the spleen, lymphoid hyperplasia in the thymus medulla and lymphocyte 
depletion in lymph nodes at all doses. In addition, sinus histiocytosis was observed at ≥10 mg/kg/day 
p.o. or ≥4 mg/kg/day i.v. in rats and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue was reduced upon long-term 
dosing of ≥10 mg/kg/day p.o. for 52 weeks in monkeys. In both long-term toxicity studies in monkeys, 
T helper cells (≤99 %), cytotoxic T cells (≤92 %) and B cells (≤94 %) were markedly depleted, 
whereas natural killer cells were less affected (≤11 %). Accordingly, the T cell-dependent antibody 
response (TDAR) against keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was clearly reduced but still present in 
monkeys administered ≥10 mg/kg/day siponimod. These pronounced reductions in lymphocytes and 
TDAR only partially reversed in the respective 8- and 12-weeks recovery periods. 
Severe nephrotoxicity developed after high siponimod doses ≥150 mg/kg/day in the 2-week oral dose 
range finding (DRF) study and at ≥2 mg/kg/day in the carcinogenicity study in mice. These adverse 
kidney events contributed to the early mortality of two animals in the DRF study and comprised renal 
tubular necrosis, mineralization, dilatation, hyaline casts and/or tubular basophilia with karyomegaly 
and elevated urea and creatinine levels. Similarly, increased hyaline droplets were observed in 
proximal convoluted renal tubules at oral doses ≥10 mg/kg/day in the 4-week subchronic study in 
rats. In the 52 weeks chronic toxicity study in monkeys, renal tubular epithelial degeneration and 
vacuolation associated with minimal/mild interstitial and tubular amphophilic kidney deposits were only

determined in three premature decedents of the 100 mg/kg/day high dose group, but not during 
regular necropsy. 
Siponimod dose-dependently increased liver weights following multiple oral doses ≥5 mg/kg/day for 13 
weeks in mice, long-term oral administration of ≥15 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥50 mg/kg/day in 
monkeys, which correlated at elevated dosages with minimal to moderate reversible centrilobular 
hypertrophy of hepatocytes as well as slight ALT increases in mice and rats. At high oral siponimod 
doses ≥150 mg/kg/day in mice and 100 mg/kg/day in monkeys, focal liver inflammations with single 
cell necrosis were additionally detected. 
In the thyroid gland of rats, reversible follicular cell hypertrophy was identified at ≥15 mg/kg/day in 
males and at 50 mg/kg/day in females of the 26-week chronic toxicity study. In the rat carcinogenicity 
study, proliferation in the thyroid gland were detected at ≥10 mg/kg/day in male rats, which 
culminated in increased follicular cell adenoma/carcinoma in the thyroid gland at this dose levels in 
both genders and has been further assessed as rat-specific metabolic adaption related to the liver 
findings (see below). 
Gastrointestinal intolerabilities in association with inflammation of the whole intestinal tract was 
prominent in all toxicity studies in monkeys at oral siponimod doses ≥50 mg/kg/day leading to 
morbidity and premature euthanasia of individual animals. The poor clinical condition was caused by 
dose-dependent protracted diarrhoea and emesis at high oral dosages ≥100 mg/kg/day.  
Slight chronic vasculopathy of small to medium sized arteries in kidneys, skin, subcutis and 
gastrointestinal tract was detected at all oral siponimod doses ≥10 mg/kg/day in the 26 weeks oral 
toxicity study in monkeys. The chronic vasculopathy was accompanied by pericardial effusion and 
eosinophilic infiltration in two early decedents that had received ≥50 mg/kg/day siponimod. In the 2 
year carcinogenicity study in rats, vascular inflammation (polyarteritis) and uterine abnormalities 
(dilatation, haemorrhage, inflammation, ulceration, hyperplasia of endometrial epithelium and vascular 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia) were induced upon long-term oral administration in all siponimod dose 
groups (≥10 mg/kg/day in males, ≥3 mg/kg/day in females) and primarily accounted for pre-terminal 
deaths. Secondary exacerbations of the vascular inflammation also consisted of haemorrhagic foci and 
necrosis in the brain, chronic progressive nephropathy in the kidneys, pleural fibrosis in the lungs and 
degeneration of seminiferous testis tubules. Degenerations of testis tubuli was similarly observed at 
the 300 mg/kg/day high dose level in the 2 weeks repeated-dose toxicity study in mice. 
Fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia with marked inflammatory foci were detected in 
the lungs at all oral dose levels (≥5 mg/kg/day) in the 13 weeks repeated-dose toxicity study in mice 
and ≥10 mg/kg/day in the 2 weeks and 4 weeks multiple dose toxicity studies in rats, but were not 
observed in the 26 weeks chronic toxicity study in rats. Chronic pulmonary inflammation and pleural 
fibrosis secondary to vascular inflammation were also determined in carcinogenicity studies at 
≥2 mg/kg/day in mice and at ≥3 mg/kg/day in rats, respectively. Moreover, one case of bronchio-
alveolar adenoma was detected in the 150 mg/kg/day group of the 2 weeks DRF study in mice. 
In the lacrimal glands of mice of the 13 week subchronic toxicity study, dose-dependent minimal to 
moderate vacuolar degenerations were identified after oral siponimod doses ≥15 mg/kg/day, which 
aggravated to marked acinar cell degeneration and atrophy at higher dosages or upon long-term 
dosing of ≥2 mg/kg/day in the carcinogenicity study in mice. In addition, corneal ulcerations were 
detected in the carcinogenicity study in rats. 
Other findings like the increased adrenal gland weights with concomitant reductions of the pituitary 
weight and the reversible vaginal epithelium mucification and uterine atrophy were restricted to rats 
only or limited to exaggerated doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in rats (≥100 
mg/kg/day) and were therefore related to stress of the animals or attributable to the moribund 
Assessment report

Page 22/163 
 
  
condition of the animals. Similarly, the moderate myofibre degenerations of skeletal muscle and the 
minimal to moderate follicular atrophy and interface dermatitis in monkeys were either limited to a few 
individuals in the chronic toxicity study or to the 100 mg/kg/day high dose level. Considering the 
absence of comparable findings in the clinical program of siponimod or fingolimod and the substantial 
safety margins, these adverse events are obviously without human relevance. With respect to the 
clinical dose of 2 mg/day, the dosages utilised in the repeat dose toxicity studies have far exceeded 
this on a human equivalent dose level. This is reflected in adequate exposure multiples achieved across 
the nonclinical species. In rats the NOAEL in the 26-week study at 50 mg/kg in males and 15 mg/kg in 
females is higher than that from the 4-week study, where it was defined at 10 mg/kg based on 
reduced body weight and food consumption. In the 26-week study these changes were transient in 
nature and therefore not considered adverse. From the 26-week study in rats the margin of exposure 
for males is high at 190-fold and 342-fold for females. In monkeys the NOAEL established in all studies 
was 10 mg/kg with a margin of exposure of 171-fold for males and 222 fold for females based on the 
52-week study. In addition, it should be taken into consideration that some of the effects that were 
considered adverse, i.e. changes in lymphoid organs, could be considered secondary to the 
pharmacology of the compound. Overall, there would appear to be an acceptable margin of exposure 
from the adverse effects noted in the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of siponimod was assessed in a standard battery of investigations in line with the ICH 
S2(R1) guideline and was found to be non-genotoxic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay test, non-
clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and non-
clastogenic/aneugenic in in vivo studies assessing its potential to induce micronuclei in polychromatic 
erythrocytes in mice and rats. 
Carcinogenicity 
104-week carcinogenicity studies following repeat-dose oral administration of siponimod were 
completed in mice and rats. 
In the mouse study siponimod administration was associated with a reduction in survival in all dosage 
groups resulting in the premature termination of dosing at week 91 and 92 in mid and high dose male 
and female groups respectively with all study animals terminally sacrifices by week 101. This approach 
is considered acceptable and is not thought to have impacted on study results. The main causes of pre-
terminal death in the mouse study were neoplastic lesions and non-neoplastic lung lesions associated 
with an increase in alveolar macrophages and eosinophilic material likely related to the primary 
pharmacological action of siponimod. A non-dose dependent statistically significant increase in 
lymphomas was observed in all female treatment groups with a statistically significant increase in 
hemangiosarcomas evident in multiple tissues in all treated groups of both sexes. Mouse lymphomas 
appear to be a class related effect of S1P modulators. Although no increased risk of lymphoma 
associated with siponimod administration has been identified in the clinical development program to 
date, it should be noted that individual cases of lymphoma associated with fingolimod administration 
have been reported. Hence, the relevance of these findings to human risk cannot be excluded at 
present. These findings are therefore included in section 5.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC). A non-dose dependent increased incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas were 
evident in all siponimod treated groups. The potential mechanisms underlying this finding were 
investigated in dedicated in vitro and in vivo non-GLP mechanistic studies. 
In the rat study, oral siponimod administration was not associated with any significant reduction in 
survival. Increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenoma was evident in all male treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 23/163 
 
  
groups with an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell carcinoma evident in mid and high 
dose male groups. This mechanism of action was investigated in an in vivo mechanistic study in male 
rats. 
Mechanistic studies 
Additional  in vivo  and  in vitro  studies  examining  the  potential  molecular  mechanisms  underlying  the 
observed  positive  results  in  the  pivotal  carcinogenicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats  and  mice.  The 
in vivo studies of 39 and 13-week duration in mice and rats respectively examined the time-course of 
molecular  changes  and  species-related  differences  which  may  be  related  to  the  development  of 
hemangiosarcomas observed in mice. Siponimod administration in mice was associated with a non-dose 
dependent  sustained  increase  in  plasma  concentration  of  PLGF-2,  a  pro-angiogenic  placental  growth 
factor,  and  a  sustained increase  in  mRNA  expression  of  endothelial  cell  activation  and  mitotic  related 
genes in skeletal muscle. In contrast, in rats the siponimod induced increase in PLGF-2 was more variable 
and transient, peaking between day 3 and 7 with no significant difference evident after that up to 13 
weeks  dosing.  Similarly,  the  siponimod  induced  increase  in  mitotic  related  genes  in  rat  is  less  robust 
than in the mouse study and was only evident at day 3 post treatment. The applicant’s suggestion that 
these  species  related  differences  in  angiogenic  and  mitotic  markers  may  underlie  the  observed 
differences in susceptibility to hemangiosarcomas is reasonable. A further in vitro study examining the 
effects of siponimod on cultured vascular endothelial cells reports that siponimod treatment is associated 
with proliferation of mouse vascular endothelial cells, but not human or rat. When considering the totality 
of the data presented and considering that similar results were reported in pivotal carcinogenicity studies 
with fingolimod it is accepted that this is likely a mouse-specific effect. 
The  applicant  also  presented  data  demonstrating  that  siponimod  administration  is  associated  with  an 
increase in liver T4-UDP-GT activity and increased circulating thyroid stimulating hormone concentration 
in rats. Thyroxine concentrations were not assessed. This was associated with increased liver and thyroid 
gland weight. This is a known rat specific effect and it is accepted that the increased incidence of thyroid 
follicular cell carcinomas observed in the pivotal rat carcinogenicity study is unlikely to be relevant for 
the assessment of human risk. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Male  fertility  was  assessed  in  a  stand-alone  study  at  doses  up  to  200  mg/kg.  At  this  dose  level  the 
animals displayed weight loss and reduced food consumption. Although epididymal weights were reduced 
there was no functional consequence on male fertility parameters.  
The doses selected for the female fertility and early embryonic development study were based on the 
findings from the embryo-foetal studies and therefore the top dose was limited to 1 mg/kg. No effects 
on  female  fertility  or  early  embryo  foetal  development  were  noted.  Food  intake  was  reduced  in  the 
premating period at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg which defined the maternal NOAEL at 0.1 mg/kg. The NOAEL for 
early embryo-foetal development was considered to be 1 mg/kg. Based on the toxicokinetics measured 
this represents a 16-fold margin of exposure at the clinical dose of 2 mg daily. 
In the rat embryo-foetal development study clear teratogenic effects and embryo lethality were seen in 
the absence of maternal toxicity with 100% resorptions seen at doses ≥1 mg/kg/day. For this reason, 
the examination of foetuses for malformations and variations was only possible in the lowest dose group 
of  1  mg/kg.  The  observed  malformations  included  cleft  palate,  malrotated  limbs,  cardiomegaly  and 
oedema. Of note, fingolimod was also shown to be teratogenic in rats at very low doses ≥0.1 mg/kg 
suggesting a class effect of S1P modulators. No NOAEL could be defined in the study and the exposure 
margin  at  the  LOAEL  of  1  mg/kg  was  19-fold.  Embryolethality  without  maternal  toxicity  was  also 
observed in the embryo-fetal development (EFD) study of siponimod in rabbits. Generalized oedema in 
Assessment report

Page 24/163 
 
  
several foetuses of the low dose and one foetus of the 1 mg/kg/day mid dose group in the rat EFD study 
were  related  to  siponimod  treatment  due  to  the  effect  of  siponimod  on  vascular  permeability  by 
modulating  intercellular  junctions.  Visceral  examinations  additionally  revealed  a  higher  incidence  for 
small gallbladders in the relatively small number of foetuses that could be evaluated in the 5 mg/kg/day 
high  dose  siponimod  group.  Thus,  the  NOAEL  for  embryo-foetal  development  was  set  at  the  lowest 
siponimod dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day. Siponimod was below the LoQ at this dose level at some of the time 
points  or  was  only  marginally  above  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLOQ)  (5  ng/ml)  resulting  in 
calculated AUC0-24 h extrapolated from the 1 mg/kg mid dose group. Hence, no safety margin could be 
determined at the NOAEL for embryo-foetal development with respect to clinical exposure at the 2 mg 
daily  dose  (0.2  fold  the  exposure  level),  whereas  the  NOAEL  for  maternal  toxicity  of  1  mg/kg/day 
corresponds to a margin of exposure of 1.7 fold. In view of the observed embryonic malformations and 
the lack of any safety margins, the use of siponimod during pregnancy and by women of childbearing 
potential not using effective contraception has been contraindicated in line with fingolimod. 
A  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study  was  performed  in  rats.  In  the  F0  generation  dams  showed 
increased gestation length and increased numbers of dead/malformed pups together with clinical signs 
and decreased body weights. Survival of the F1 generation pups was reduced postnatally. Those pups 
which  were  born  had  increased  external,  urogenital  and  skeletal  anomalies.  As  adults  there  were  no 
effects  on  reproductive  function  or  behavioural  defects.  Of  importance,  although  some  changes  in 
immunophenotyping were seen in the F1 generation, there were no differences in the TDAR responses 
to KLH challenge suggesting that the antibody response to antigens was not overtly affected in the F1 
generation. The NOAEL for the F0 and F1 generations was the same at 0.05 mg/kg. Toxicokinetics were 
not performed as part of the study, however, based on extrapolation from the 1 mg/kg dose in the rat 
EFD study it is expected that the maternal exposure levels were approximately 0.9-fold the expected 
clinical  exposure  at  2  mg  siponimod  per  day.  Therefore,  no  safety  margin  concerning  prenatal  and 
postnatal development could be established. 
Local Tolerance 
The contact sensitising potential of siponimod was assessed in a murine local lymph node assay. Skin 
and eye irritation were assessed in rabbits. All studies were conducted according to GLP. Siponimod was 
a weak skin irritant in mice, which was attributed to test article remnants, without any significant findings 
in  rabbits.  There  was  no  siponimod-related  local  irritation  evident  following  a  single  administration  to 
rabbits  via  intravenous,  peri-venous  or  intra-arterial  routes  of  administration.  The  data  suggest  that 
siponimod  is  unlikely  to  produce  local  irritation  following  dermal  contact  or  when  administered 
parenterally. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
A  stand-alone  immunotoxicity  study  consisting  of  immunophenotyping  and  a  TDAR  was  performed  in 
rats following a period of 4 weeks dosing at levels up to 50 mg/kg. In all dose groups marked decreases 
in peripheral blood and splenic T cell subset counts were noted in line with the expected pharmacology. 
Marked  decreases  in  T  helper  and  cytotoxic  T  cell  populations  were  also  seen  with  mild  to  marked 
decreases in peripheral blood and splenic B cells. The primary and secondary response to the TDAR was 
decreased at all dose levels. Of note, these effects on immunophenotyping and the TDAR were reversible 
following 6 weeks of recovery. Similar effects on immunophenotyping and the TDAR were also seen in 
monkeys  when  assessed  as  part  of  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  although  the  recovery  was  not 
complete at the end of the recovery period. In rats as part of the PPND the TDAR in the F1 generation 
Assessment report

did  not  indicate  an  effect  of  siponimod  treatment.  Taken  together  the  data  suggest  that  the 
immunomodulatory effects siponimod are reversible upon treatment withdrawal. 
Dependence 
The dependence potential of siponimod was assessed in GLP compliant studies in rats. Rats displayed no 
test-article  related  withdrawal  effects  as  assessed  via  body  weight  gain,  food  consumption  and 
observations (grooming, rearing, activity in a novel environment) and no reinforcing effects were evident 
in at the highest dose tested. These data and the lack of off-target binding activity at proposed clinical 
exposures do not indicate a risk for abuse or dependence associated with siponimod. 
Metabolites 
No dedicated studies assessing the toxicity of major human metabolites M3 and M17 have been carried 
out.  Metabolite  concentrations  were  not  measured  directly  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  but  were 
instead  inferred  based  on  the  ratio  of  metabolite  to  parent  present  in  non-GLP  PK  studies.  Given  the 
primary human metabolites were identified after the completion of pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
this approach was accepted. Of note, no pharmacological activity on S1P modulation was evident for M3 
and the activity of M17 was significantly lower than that of siponimod.  
Impurities 
The  applicant  has  assessed  impurities  for  mutagenicity  in-silico  via  an  expert  based  (DEREK)  and 
statistical based (MCASE) system as per ICH M7 guidance. Impurities with a structural alert were tested 
in bacterial reverse mutation assays. Several potential impurities were found to be genotoxic; they are 
controlled  at  the  Threshold  of  Toxicological  Concern  (TTC),  or  are  considered  purged  below  the  TTC. 
Several other impurities tested in AMES tests due to potential structural alerts were shown not to be 
genotoxic. Although the study reports for these AMES tests have been submitted, the studies were only 
performed in accordance with the principles of GLP but not in full GLP compliance. Nevertheless, this was 
accepted, and the identified impurities are regarded as non-genotoxic 
Phototoxicity 
Siponimod maximally absorbs at ~260 nm, but its MEC of 3309 l·mol-1·cm-1 at 290 nm was still above 
the 1000 l·mol-1·cm-1 trigger value. Consequently, the phototoxic potential of siponimod was investigated 
in  line  with  ICH S10  requirements  (EMA/CHMP/ICH/752211/2012).  Nevertheless,  siponimod  was  not 
phototoxic  or  cytotoxic  up  to  100 µg/ml  in  a  3T3 NRU  assay  performed  with  UVA  irradiation  in vitro. 
Higher  concentrations  of  316  and  1000 µg/ml  could  not  be  tested  due  to  test  item  precipitations. 
Although  the  more  appropriate  UVB  range  (280-315 nm)  was  not  studied,  assay  repetition  was  not 
deemed necessary, because the absorbance curve of siponimod declines at wavelengths <320 nm.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  of  siponimod  is  in  accordance  with  the  pertinent  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr.  2)  and  does  not  indicate  risks  for  organisms  in  surface  water, 
groundwater and for microorganisms.  
A  risk  assessment  for  the  terrestrial  compartment  is  not  required  due  to  the  low  binding  affinity  of 
siponimod  to  sewage  sludge.  Due  to  a  log  Dow  >3,  a  study  on  bioconcentration  in  fish  has  been 
submitted.  As  the  derived  BCF  values  were  clearly  below  the  trigger  value  of  2000,  siponimod  is  not 
considered  bioaccumulative  according  to  the  B  criterion  of  the  PBT  assessment.    The  risk  ratio  for 
secondary poisoning for siponimod is below 1 and therefore indicates no concern for secondary poisoning 
via the aquatic food chain.

Siponimod is not a PBT substance but has to be classified as very persistent (vP) in sediments based on 
a  DT50  of  >180  days  in  sediment  at  20°C  determined  in  a  transformation  study  in  water/sediment 
systems. The applicant was requested to recalculate the half-lives should by using the k2 values and to 
normalise these values to 12°C. These updates are included in the updated ERA Table 1: Transformation 
products >10 % were not detected. The T criterion (NOEC <0.01 mg/l) is also fulfilled due to a NOEC of 
0.0054 mg/l for fish.  
- Considering the above data, siponimod is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Sufficient  in  vitro  evidence  has  been  presented  to  suggest  that  siponimod  is  relatively  selective  for 
binding to S1P1 and S1P5. Binding of siponimod to S1P1 results in functional antagonism as a result of 
internalisation of the receptor. In contrast, binding to S1P5 results in agonist effects which may help to 
mediate the remyelination effects that have been seen in some animal models with the use of siponimod. 
Efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  in  both  rat  and  mouse  models  of  experimental  autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis  which  mostly  correlated  with  the  expected  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  reducing 
peripheral lymphocyte counts. Taken with the known clinical efficacy of the first-in-class S1P modulator, 
fingolimod, sufficient proof of concept has been shown.  
The  secondary  pharmacology  screen  did  not  reveal  any  results  of  concern.  The  safety  pharmacology 
package,  and  in  particular  the  cardiovascular  studies,  are  comprehensive  and  provide  plausible 
explanations for the noted effects on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction. The proposed clinical 
titration  regimen  of  siponimod  until  maintenance  therapy  is  reached  on  day 6,  is  supported  by  the 
improved safety of escalating siponimod doses in telemetered monkeys. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic and ADME studies were performed in mouse, rat, monkey and human. Overall the ADME 
properties of siponimod were characterized by slow to moderate absorption rate (tmax was between 2 
to  8  h  in  mouse,  rat  and  monkey  after  po  dosing),  a  moderate  bioavailability,  a  medium  volume  of 
distribution  including  distribution  in  the  brain  and  a  low  clearance.  Data  are  in  line  with  human  data 
showing a tmax between 3-8 hours with a median of 4 hours. The terminal plasma elimination half-life 
was  moderate  in  male  rat  and  longer  in  mouse,  female  rat,  monkey,  and  human.  Siponimod  was 
eliminated  mainly  by  metabolism,  and  subsequent  biliary/fecal  excretion  with  no  or  negligible 
contribution by elimination into urine in all species. Plasma protein binding was very high in all species.  
Methods of analysis 
In  general  methods  for  analysis  for  the  assessment  of  siponimod  concentrations  in  relevant  matrices 
were  appropriately  validated  in  line  with  the  European  guideline  on  bioanalytical  method  validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.1  Corr.  2**)  with  some  minor  deviations  unlikely  to  affect  the 
validity of results.

Metabolite exposure 
Concentrations  of  metabolites  M3  and  M17  were  not  directly  assessed  in  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies. Instead, levels in these studies were inferred based on the ratio of metabolite to parent observed 
in non-GLP PK and exploratory studies in relevant species, and no method validation has been submitted 
for the methods of analysis used to determine metabolite concentrations in these studies. M3 and M17 
were identified after pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were completed at which time no TK retention 
samples from those studies were available. Although the approach was not in line with ICH S3A guidance, 
the CHMP agreed with the provided justification for this approach and that the safety of metabolites M3 
and M17 were adequately qualified in pivotal non-clinical repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Toxicology 
A significant margin of exposure exists from the identified NOAELs in the repeat dose toxicity studies 
and the clinical exposure levels at the clinical dose of 2 mg daily. In relation to the reproductive and 
developmental toxicology, significant findings of embryo-foetal toxicity and teratogenicity were seen at 
dose levels less than the clinical exposure levels and were attributed to the pharmaceutical class of S1P 
modulators because similar findings were seen with fingolimod. Due to the role of S1P modulators like 
siponimod during embryonic vascular development, it can be assumed that siponimod might cause foetal 
harm  when  used  in  pregnant  women.  Therefore,  a  contraindication  on  the  use  of  siponimod  during 
pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective  contraception  was  included  in 
section 4.3 of the SmPC with additional information on this risk provided in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3. 
This is in line with the PI for pharmacologically related compound fingolimod. 
Tumor findings were reported in 104-week carcinogenicity studies in both mice and rats. In vitro and 
in vivo mechanistic studies that examined the time course of molecular changes prior to the development 
of neoplastic thyroid follicular cell lesions and hemangiosarcomas in rats and mice suggest that these 
findings are likely species-specific effects, which were labelled as such in section 5.3 of the SmPC in line 
with fingolimod. Skin carcinoma was detected in the scrotum of a single male monkey in the 52-week 
carcinogenicity study. Although this finding was not replicated in carcinogenicity studies in rats or mice, 
given the established involvement of the S1P1 receptor in tumorigenesis, a warning regarding cutaneous 
neoplasms has been included in the product information of siponimod in line with the currently approved 
version of fingolimod.  
A risk for the environment due to use of siponimod by patients is not expected.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Siponimod was evaluated in safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  as  well  as  in  studies  to  assess  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicity, local tolerability, photoreactive potential, immunotoxicity and dependence and 
abuse potential.  
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  siponimod’s 
immunomodulatory effects are due to its S1P1-mediated ability to induce sequestration of lymphocytes 
within secondary lymphoid organs, hence, reducing the permeation of lymphocytes into the CNS. The 
potential  binding  to  S1P1  receptors  on  astrocytes  and/or  S1P5  receptors  on  oligodendrocytes,  may 
additionally impact on neuronal inflammation as well as demyelination and remyelination processes. In 
safety pharmacology studies, findings related to the modulation of S1P1 were identified. These included 
transient  and  slight  effects  on  the  cardiovascular  system  and  on  the  respiratory  system.  No  relevant 
effects were identified in the CNS safety pharmacology study in rat.

Pharmacokinetic and ADME studies were performed in mouse, rat, and monkey. Oral bioavailability of 
siponimod was high in all species. Absorption of siponimod in animals after oral administration was slow 
to moderate, with tmax of 2-8 hours. Siponimod distributed to most tissues in rodents and was detected 
in the brain, with exposures 5-16-fold those in plasma, respectively; highest exposure was observed in 
white matter. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys, siponimod markedly affected the lymphoid 
system (lymphopenia, lymphoid atrophy and reduced antibody response), which is consistent with its 
primary pharmacological activity at S1P1 receptors. 
Dose-limiting toxicities in animal species were nephrotoxicity in mice, body weight development in rats 
and adverse CNS and gastrointestinal effects in monkeys. The main target organs of toxicity in the three 
species  included  the  lung,  liver,  thyroid,  kidney  and  uterus/vagina.  In  monkeys,  vasculopathies  and 
effects on muscle and skin were additionally observed. These toxicities developed at more than 30-fold 
higher  systemic  siponimod  levels  than  the  AUC-based  human  exposure  at  the  maintenance  dose  of 
2 mg/day. 
Siponimod did not exert any phototoxic, and dependence potential and was not genotoxic in vitro and 
in vivo. 
Taking into account the established role of S1P1 receptors in vascular formation during embryogenesis, 
the absence of any safety margins with regard to therapeutic siponimod exposure and the consistent 
non-clinical  and  clinical  experience  gained  meanwhile  with  fingolimod,  the  use  of  siponimod  during 
pregnancy  and  by  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using  effective  contraception  has  been 
contraindicated.   
In carcinogenicity investigations, siponimod induced lymphoma, haemangioma and haemangiosarcoma 
in  mice,  whereas  follicular  adenoma  and  carcinoma  of  the  thyroid  gland  were  identified  in  male  rats. 
These  tumour  findings  were  either  regarded  as  mouse-specific  or  attributable  to  metabolic  liver 
adaptations in the particularly sensitive rat species and are of questionable human relevance, which has 
been clarified in the SmPC accordingly. 
Based on the available non-clinical data regarding pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and toxicology 
of siponimod, the application was considered approvable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK/PD  data  were  derived  from  15  clinical  pharmacokinetics  studies,  pooled  PK,  pooled  categorical 
analyses  of  primary  and  secondary  PD  effects  of  siponimod  in  Clinical  Pharmacology,  polymyositis 
(PM)/dermatomyositis (DM) patient studies and 2 Population PK analyses and an exposure-lymphocyte 
relationship analysis, which include data from MS patients in Studies A2201 and A2304.  
In the 20 Clinical Pharmacology studies, a total of approximately 1281 subjects have been enrolled, of 
which approximately 880 healthy subjects, 24 hepatic impaired subjects and 8 renal impaired subjects 
have received siponimod and approximately 434 healthy subjects have received placebo. This includes 
subjects  who  sequentially  received  placebo  and  siponimod.  In  addition,  approximately  363  healthy 
subjects were exposed to other study drugs either alone or in combination with siponimod. 
Methods 
Liquid  chromatography  coupled  with  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  methods  were  used  for 
quantification of siponimod (BAF312) and its metabolites in plasma and urine. The methods were mainly 
validated at a CRO and subject to audit by the site QA.  Non-compartmental analysis, Pop PK and PD 
analyses were conducted using conventional software and methods. 
Three  population  PK  models  were  developed  to  investigate  the  influence  of  different  covariates  e.g. 
genotype,  weight,  co-medication  on  siponimod  exposure  along  with  smoking  status  and  for  PK/PD 
analyses of the effect of siponimod on lymphocyte counts, EDSS and infections in MS patients. A PBPK 
model using SimCYP was developed for prediction of siponimod Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) with typical 
CYP perpetrators. 
The  population  PK  model  for  healthy  volunteers  (HV)  and  RRMS  patients  was  a  two-compartment 
disposition model with first-order elimination and mixed zero- and first-order absorption. No major PK 
difference was observed between the two populations. Body weight affected Cl and Vd. CYP2C9 genotype 
had significant impact on siponimod PK by affecting Cl. Food effect had impact on Tmax only.  
A  Pop  PK  model,  including  data  from  1045  SPMS,  patients  was  developed  based  on  the  previous  PK 
model in HV and RRMS patients. Weight on CL/F and Vc/F as well as age, gender and CYP2C9 genotypes 
WT/*3 and *2/*3 on CL/F were significant covariates.  
A  PK/PD  model  was  developed  linking  siponimod  plasma  concentrations  to  lymphocyte  counts  in  HV, 
RRMS  and  SPMS  patients.  Lymphocyte  count  was  lower  in  siponimod  treated  subjects  compared  to 
placebo.  
A  PBPK  model  was  build  using  SimCYP.  The  model  was  verified  by  data  from  various  studies:  single 
ascending  dose  (SAD),  multiple  ascending  dose  (MAD),  an  absolute  bioavailability  study,  a  CYP2C9 
genotype study, Pop PK and two DDI studies with fluconazole and rifampicin. All were in good agreement 
with predicted.

Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination/Excretion 
Table 3: Main PK parameters after siponimod single dose administration (0.1 to 75mg) to healthy 
subjects 
Absorption  
In vitro, siponimod was classified as a highly permeable compound. Intestinal uptake data of siponimod 
suggest that luminal membrane permeability occurs most likely by a passive permeation process without 
an involvement of drug efflux transporters. 
• 
Bioavailability 
Bioavailability was studies in 5 studies: A2101, A2102, A2105, A2104, and A2126. Dose proportionality 
between dose and Cmax or AUC, respectively, was observed until a dose of 75 mg. No plateau appeared. 
The  proposed  posology  of  2  mg  falls  within  the  range  where  dose  proportionality  was  demonstrated. 
Tmax was approximately 3-6 hours with no apparent dose dependency. The decay in siponimod plasma 
concentration  over  time  is  bi-exponential.  The  effective  half-life  relevantly  contributing  to  BAF312 
accumulation is comprised between 22 h and 36 h and corresponds to the T1/2,α which could be observed 
after single and multiple dose administrations. The absolute bioavailability was estimated to 84%.  
• 
Bioequivalence  
Bioequivalence was studied in 2 studies: A2111 and A2119.  Bioequivalence was established between 
the Final Market Image (FMI) and the Market Formulation (MF) in the fasting state.  
Compared  with  the  immediate  release  formulation,  Tmax  of  the  modified  release  formulations  was 
increased (around 2-fold), and the Cmax and AUC were decreased. As such, the Tmax of formulation 
F16 and F10 were 7 and 8 hours, respectively, whereas Tmax for IR was 4 hours. Cmax and AUC of F16 
were around 50 % lower the corresponding values of IR, and Cmax and AUC of F10 were 16% lower the 
corresponding values of IR. Due to the differences in formulations, the discrepancies in Tmax, Cmax and 
AUC are considered in line with expectations.

• 
Influence of food  
Two clinical studies contributed with data to evaluate the influence on food: A2101 and A2111. 
A delayed Tmax of 8 hours was observed in the fed state compared to 3 hours in the fasting state when 
administering siponimod 5 mg. Cmax was slightly lower in the fed state compared with the fasting state 
(0.91  [90%  CI:  0.79;1.05]),  whereas  AUC  did  not  differ.  For  siponimod  0.25  mg  and  4  mg  FMI,  no 
differences were observed for siponimod 0.25 mg regarding Cmax and AUC, whereas Cmax was lower 
in the fed state compared with fasting for siponimod 4 mg (0.91 [90% CI: 0.86;0.97]). Despite a delay 
in Tmax to 8 hours after single dose, food intake had no effect on the systemic exposure of siponimod 
(Cmax and AUC), therefore siponimod may be taken without regard to meals, as reflected in section 4.2 
of the SmPC. The influence of food on the PK after a single dose is referenced in the SmPC Section 5.2. 
Distribution  
Overall,  siponimod  was  moderately  distributed  within  the  human  body  following  oral  administration. 
Siponimod  and  its  metabolites  were  mainly  confined  within  the  plasma  compartment  and  very  highly 
bound to human plasma proteins (>99.9%). The volume of distribution was estimated to 291 L in the 
14C ADME study (A2104) and 124 L in the absolute bioavailability study (A2126), which is supported by 
the pop PK model finding a typical volume of distribution of 126 L.  
Elimination  
An apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of 3.11 l/h was estimated in MS patients. The apparent 
elimination half-life of siponimod is approximately 30 hours. 
The  14C  ADME  study  demonstrated  that  the  primary  route  of  elimination  was  metabolism  through 
hydroxylation  and  subsequent  glucuronidation  or  sulphation  with  faecal/biliary  excretion.  The  major 
metabolite identified in the  14C ADME study (A2104) was M3,  whereas another metabolite (M17) was 
identified as the major metabolite in the absolute bioavailability study (A2126). M17 was not identified 
after 10 mg siponimod in the 14C ADME study, which is due to short duration of the ADME study. M3 was 
not identified as an active metabolite, however M17 was estimated to account for 3% of the siponimod 
activity.  
Metabolism  
Based  on  in  vitro  studies,  it  was  estimated  that  CYP2C9  and  CYP3A4  contribute  79.3%  and  18.5%, 
respectively, to the metabolism of siponimod.  
The  14C  ADME  study  (Study  A2104)  demonstrated  that  siponimod  was  metabolised  to  several 
metabolites, of which M3 was the most prominent, accounting for 18% of the radioactivity.  Five other 
metabolites  were  identified  of  which  each  accounted  for  1.5  to  3.7%  of  the  reactivity.  Accumulation 
factors of metabolites P29.6 and P30.5 were estimated to 54.3 and 28.9, respectively, but the metabolite 
to parent AUCtau,ss ratios are low (0.19 and 0.11 for P29.6 and P30.5, respectively) and the metabolites 
do not contribute marginally to the total exposure.  
The absolute bioavailability study identified M17 as the most prominent metabolite accounting for 81-
97% of the parent exposure. M17 was not detected in the 14C ADME study. Considering the long half-life 
of M17, M17 may form over time and thus the design of the 14C ADME study did not permit M17 detection. 
The siponimod:M17 ratio after a single dose of 0.25 mg is 1:1, but after one year of 2 mg qd continuous 
dosing to SPMS patients in the phase 3 study the ratio remains 1:1.

Figure 2: General scheme of Siponimod (BAF312) biotransformation pathways in human 
•  Pharmacokinetics of metabolites  
The PK of the main metabolites (M3 and M17) were examined in studies A2104 and A2118 (M3), and in 
studies A2126 and A2304 (M17). Apart from metabolites M3 and M17, all other metabolites occurred in 
concentrations below 10% and will, according to guideline, not be assessed further.  
In the 14C ADME study (A2104), Tmax of M3 was 6 hours and T½ was approximately 30 hours, which is 
similar to T½ of siponimod. In the QT study (A2118), M3 represented 33-39 % of AUClast and Cmax,ss 
of  siponimod,  which  is  indicative  of  a  substantial  presence  of  the  M3  metabolite.  In  the  absolute 
bioavailability study (study A2126), Tmax of M17 was estimated to 96 hours and T½ was approximately 
155 hours. M17 was measured at end of study in the phase 3 study.

Studies have showed that siponimod is mainly metabolised via CYP2C9. In study A2128, in subjects with 
CYP2C9*2*3 or CYP2C9*3*3 genotype, a 2 or 4-fold increase, respectively, in AUCinf and T½ compared 
with CYP2C9*1*1 was shown. Likewise, the pharmacokinetic parameters for the metabolites M3 and M5 
are  delayed  or  lower  in  subjects  with  CYP2C9*3*3  compared  with  CYP2C9*1*1.  No  marked  Cmax 
differences between genotypes were observed.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
•  Dose proportionality 
Dose  proportionality  across  the  tested  range  was  determined  in  single-dose  studies  (Studies  A2101, 
A2105 and A1101) and multiple-dose studies (studies A2105 and A2201).   
•  Time dependency 
Study  A2101  investigated  single  dose  administration  and  study  A2105  investigated  multiple  dose 
administration.  Siponimod exhibits time independent PK (AUCinf after single dose is comparable to the 
AUCtau,ss after multiple dose). The decay in siponimod plasma concentration over time is bi-exponential. 
The effective half-life relevantly contributing to BAF312 accumulation is comprised between 22 h and 36 
h and corresponds to the T1/2,α which could be observed after single and multiple dose administrations. 
AUC0-24 showed an accumulation index of approximately 2 across all doses after multiple daily dosing.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-subject variability was assessed in studies A2101, A2105, A1101 and A2128. Furthermore, a pooled 
analysis including healthy subjects in studies A2105 and A2118 and MS subjects in studies A2201 (RRMS) 
and A2304 (SPMS). The inter-subject variability of AUC was 10% to 60% in the single dose studies and 
increased  with  increasing dose  in the  multi dose  study.  The  inter-subject  variability  was  larger in the 
pooled data from SPMS and RRMS patients compared with healthy subjects. Based on popPK analysis, 
the coefficient of variation for Cl/F was 24.2% in SPMS patients, which is similar to the values of healthy

subjects indicating similar inter-individual variability. Based on estimates of PK-parameters for SPMS, 
RRMS and healthy subjects, the intra-subject variability is similar between populations.  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Siponimod  was  tested  in  dermatomyositis  (DM)  and  polymyositis  (PM)  patients  as  well  as  in  RRMS 
patients in phase 2. However, patients with secondary progressive MS were only studied in the single 
pivotal phase 3 study A2304.  
The concentrations in steady state in the target population were higher than in healthy volunteers. Thus, 
due to differences in study design and sampling times between studies in healthy subjects and the target 
population, direct comparisons are not possible. The simulated PK data are similar to the observed data 
based  on  healthy  volunteers  and  RRMS  patients.  Health  status  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  the 
model.  This  supports  that  data  obtained  in  healthy  volunteers  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  target 
population and RRMS patients. 
Special populations  
RRMS, polymyositis and dermatomyositis patients: In RRMS patients, the plasma concentrations 
were  higher  than  in  healthy  subjects  due  to  different  sampling  time.  In  patients  with  polymyositis  or 
dermatomyositis the trough concentrations were 2-fold higher than in healthy volunteers, which could 
be caused by co-medication (CYP3A4 inhibitors), lower body weight and low sample size.  
Impaired renal function (Study A2129): In severe renal impaired subjects, total and unbound AUC 
were slightly increased (by 23to 33%) compared to heathy matches subjects, whereas Cmax decreased 
by  8%.  No  dose  adjustment  is  requested.  Small  differences  in  Cmax  and  AUC  of  the  metabolite  M3 
between healthy and renal impaired subjects were observed. The metabolite M17 has not been measured 
in renal impaired subjects, however, it is expected that renal impairment would result in a relative lower 
level of M17 compared to the parent drug, as M17 is a cholesterol ester metabolite.  
Impaired  hepatic  function  (Study  2122):  No  relevant  differences  between  groups  of  hepatic 
impairment were observed. However, for the metabolite M3, markedly increased values of Cmax and 
AUC were detected. As the affinity to the S1P1 receptor of the metabolite M3 is considered negligible 
compared  to  the  mother  compound,  the  increases  in  the  metabolite  concentrations  is  regarded  as 
clinically insignificant.  
Race: The evaluations of siponimod PK in the clinical study in Japanese subjects and the Phase 
1/Phase 2 and Phase 3 PopPK analyses (in Caucasians, Blacks, Japanese and subjects of another race, 
and in Japanese and Chinese subjects, respectively) suggest that race/ethnicity does not significantly 
affect siponimod PK. 
Gender: No clinical studies designed to detect possible gender differences were conducted. The popPK 
model indicated that some differences could be present between gender regarding lymphocyte count. 
However,  the  model  showed  high  shrinkage  and  as  such  the  predictions  based  on  gender  should  be 
interpreted with caution. Overall, it is considered justified that no clinically relevant differences based on 
gender are present.   
Weight: Differences in bodyweight did affect siponimod exposure. Effect of weight and CYP2C9 genotype 
was simulated in SPMS patients receiving a 2 mg daily dose and showed a 5-fold difference between 
lowest and highest median AUC,ss. However, within the normal weight range, the impact of body weight 
alone is not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment is considered warranted.

Children and elderly:  
In the 2 PopPK analyses, age (range assessed: 18 to 61 years) was not identified as a covariate affecting 
siponimod CL/F. As hepatic and renal impairment do not impact siponimod PK, differences in siponimod 
PK are not expected between elderly and younger subjects. 
No data in children or elderly patients has been generated. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro: Siponimod showed weak inhibition of CYP3A4 (IC50 100 µM) and of CYP2C9 (IC50 230 µM) in 
vitro.  Time  dependent  inhibition  of  CYP2C9  was  demonstrated.  Intestinal  uptake  of  siponimod  was 
studied in Caco-2 cells with well-known efflux pump inhibitors. The results pointed to passive permeation 
as the uptake mechanism without involvement of the efflux transporters P-gp, BCRP or MRP2. Siponimod 
was shown to inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (IC50 1.65 μM and 2.88 μM, respectively). In a hepatic 
uptake  study,  it  was  demonstrated  that  siponimod  hepatic  uptake  was  soley  driven  by  passive 
permeability without involvement of uptake transporters.   
In vitro, the metabolite M3 showed weak inhibition of CYP2B6 (IC50 = 94 μM) and CYP2C9 (IC50 = 80 
μM).  M3  was  an  inhibitor  of  human  BSEP  and  OCT1  with  maximal  inhibition  of  38.5%  and  32%, 
respectively and an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 with IC50 of 3.7 μM and 4.1 μM, respectively. 
M17  showed  no  relevant  inhibition  of  the  transport  activities  of  P-gp,  BCRP,  BSEP,  MRP2,  OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K at the tested concentrations. 
In  silico:  The  Pop  PK  model  for  SPMS  patients  and  PD  data  from  study  A2304  was  used  to  explore 
whether or not smoking would affect siponimod PK as smoking is a potent CYP1A1 inducer; this showed 
that induction of CYP1A1 by smoking have no effect on siponimod PK. Individual plasma concentration-
time profiles for smokers and non-smokers  showed similar distributions. 
Impact  of  the  six  different  CYP2C9  genotypes  on  siponimod  PK  and  the  drug  interaction  potential  in 
presence of perpetrators for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine 
rifampicin, erythromycin, and efavirenz) were evaluated in silico using SimCyp. Itraconazole, fluconazole 
and  rifampicin  were  backed  up  by  in  vivo  DDI  data  with  siponimod.  There  was  initially  a  mismatch 
between  simulated  and  observed  data  for  interaction  with  itraconazole,  however  PBPK  simulation 
including both CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 metabolic pathways could better explain the observed in vivo results.  
The simulations showed that strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (itraconazole and ketoconazole) in the CYP2C9 
*3*3 genotype populations had increased DDI risk with a predicted AUC increase of 3.25 to 4.42-fold. 
This  is  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  For  the  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor  erythromycin  the  *3*3 
genotype had 2.5 fold higher AUC than the other genotypes.

When  siponimod  is  co-administered  with  a  moderate  CYP2C9/moderate  CYP3A4  dual  inhibitor  (e.g. 
fluconazole),  the  predicted  net  effect  is  between  1.78-2.15  fold  for  *1*1,  *1*2,  *1*3  and  *2*3,  the 
highest effect being estimated for CYP2C9 *2*2 patients, with a net effect of 2.73-fold. The combination 
of  siponimod  with  moderate  CYP2C9  or  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  or  moderate dual  inhibitor  should  be 
avoided irrespective of the CYP2C9 genotype. 
In vivo:  
Study A2108: The potent CYP2C9 inhibitor fluconazole (200 mg qd) given concomitantly with a single 
dose  of  4  mg  siponimod  increased  the  AUC  of  siponimod  2-fold  and  the  Cmax  by  10%.This  effect  is 
considered clinically relevant; hence dose reduction of siponimod when co-administered with fluconazole 
or  other  dual  CYP3A4/CYP2C9  inhibitors  is  recommended  and  considered  adequately  reflected  in  the 
SmPC. 
Figure 5: Arithmetic mean (SD) concentration-time profiles per treatment PK analysis set 
Study  A2124:  Co-administration  of  a  single  0.25  mg  dose  of  siponimod  with  itraconazole  (a  strong 
CYP3A4  inhibitor)  at  100  mg  bid  decreased  siponimod  AUCs  by  10%  and  24%  in  subjects  with  the 
CYP2C9*1*2 and *1*3 genotypes, respectively. For the major metabolite M17 Cmax decreased by 28% 
and  38%  and  AUClast  decreased  by  58%  and  77%,  in  subjects  with  the  *1*2  and  *1*3  genotypes, 
respectively.  
Study A2125: In the clinical study with rifampin (a moderate CYP2C9/strong CYP3A4 inducer), 600 mg 
qd significantly decreased the steady-state exposure of siponimod (2 mg qd). The Cmax,ss of siponimod 
decreased by 45% while AUCtau,ss decreased by 57% in the presence of rifampin (Figure 6). This effect 
is considered clinically relevant hence concomitant use of siponimod with rifampin or other inducers of 
CYP3A4/CYP2C9  should  be  avoided  due  to  concern  of  lack  of  efficacy.  This  is  considered  adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. The exposure of metabolite M3 Cmax,ss increased by 53% in presence of rifampin, 
but AUCtau,ss did not change. 
Study A2121: Co-administration of 4 mg siponimod qd with an oral contraceptive did not cause significant 
changes  to  exposure  of  ethinylestradiol  or  changes  in  PD  parameters.  Levonorgestrel  Cmax,ss  and 
AUCtau increased by 18% and 28% when co-administered with siponimod for 27 days. This effect is not 
considered clinically relevant.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Siponimod is an oral compound that acts on the S1P receptor and selectively targets 2 (S1P1 and S1P5) 
of  the  5  known  S1P  receptors.  Siponimod  has  immunomodulatory  properties  required  for  therapeutic 
approaches in multiple sclerosis. 
T cells selectively require S1P1 activation for emigration from the thymus, and both T and B cells require 
this receptor for egress from peripheral lymphoid organs. Siponimod promotes a marked and long-lasting 
internalization and degradation of S1P1 receptors, thereby acting as a functional antagonist on S1P1. 
This makes lymphoid cells unresponsive to S1P signalling, thus depriving them of their capacity to egress 
from lymphoid organs (lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches) and thereby preventing the recirculation of 
lymphocytes to blood and tissues including the CNS. 
Siponimod  does  not  deplete  lymphocytes  but  results  in  redistribution  away  from  the  intravascular 
compartment. This effect results in a dose-dependent reduction of peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte 
count.

Absolute lymphocyte counts: In the single dose study (A2101), siponimod showed a dose dependent 
decline in absolute lymphocyte count between siponimod 0.3 to 10 mg. The  recovery of lymphocytes 
was seen after 48 days, and due to a half-life of 27 to 57 hours, a once daily dose regimen was selected.  
In the multiple dose study (A2105), there was a similar dose dependent decline in lymphocyte counts 
up to siponimod 10 mg as well as CD4+ and CD8+  cells. The recovery of  CD4+ and  CD8+ is almost 
complete 3 week post treatment.  
In  poor  metabolisers  the  percentage  of  lymphocytes  are  provided  and  seems  lower  for  extensive 
metabolisers  than  poor  metabolisers,  which  is  somewhat  expected.  In  extensive  metabolisers,  the 
lymphocyte counts increased slightly as expected during treatment with a strong CYP2C9/3A4 inducer. 
In pooled analysis, 73.3% had a lymphocyte counts between 0.2 to 1.2 x 109/L and 12.7% of the subjects 
had  lymphocytes  within  the  normal  range.  Even  though  the  defined  therapeutic  absolute  lymphocyte 
count is < 1.2 × 109/L, clinically relevant disease modifying effects remain present even with lymphocyte 
counts above 1.2 × 109/L. No individuals in the treatment with siponimod 2 mg experienced lymphocyte 
counts below 0.2 x 109/L. 
Figure 7: Mean absolute lymphocyte count after multiple dose of siponimod in healthy subjects 
The  relationship  between  dose  and  lymphocyte  counts  were  modelled  in  a  PopPKPD  analysis.  This 
revealed a dose response relationship. It supported that weight did not impact lymphocyte count to a 
clinically  relevant  degree  (Figure  8).  Further,  it  revealed  a  small  but  not  clinically  relevant  impact  of 
Japanese origin and gender.

Efficacy of T cell-dependent and T cell-independent vaccines: In Study A2130, the proportions of 
responders  at  4  weeks  after  vaccination  by  treatment  group  for  each  antigen  demonstrated  that  the 
immune response and efficacy of the quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was not compromised after 
short  treatment  interruption  of  1  week  prior  until  4  weeks  after  vaccination.  Concomitant  use  of  the 
quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine and siponimod reduced the responder rate by 15% to 30%. In 
contrast,  the  PPV-23  vaccine  can  be  co-administered  with  siponimod  without  compromising  immune 
response and vaccination efficacy. 
Pharmacodynamics of metabolites: Very week or no activity of M3 compared to the parent drug was 
found. In contrast, M17 contributed to around 3% to the pharmacological activity on S1P1 and S1P5.  
•  Secondary pharmacology 
Heart rate: Siponimod has a negative chronotropic effect. Dose titration up to 10 mg showed a reduction 
in the negative chronotropic effect. Dose titration to 2 mg (the proposed dose for the majority of patients) 
was not evaluated in the dedicated dose titration study 2107, however as dose titration to 10 mg did not 
lead to further decrease in heart rate, it is indicated that the heart rate recovery is stabilised. Maximum 
heart rate decreased 16-20 bpm by dose titration, but the placebo corrected changes in heart rate were 
4.1 bpm. The magnitude of the negative chronotropic effects at siponimod re-initiation appeared to be 
dependent  on  both  the  dose  and  the  duration  of  treatment  discontinuation.  The  SmPC  recommends 
treatment to be re-initiated with a titration phase following discontinuation of treatment for 4 or more 
consecutive days.

Figure 9: Maximum decrease from baseline in hourly average heart rate for days 1-12 
In study A2119, no statistically significant differences in heart rate were seen between modified release 
formulations and the immediate release formulation, and the immediate release formulation was carried 
forward.  
Cardiac  Conduction:  Siponimod  has  a  negative  dromotropic  effect.  Overall,  across  the  clinical 
pharmacology studies, first and second degree AV blocks were seen, but no second degree AV blocks 
Mobitz type 2 were identified. One subject in the study A2111 experienced severe bradycardia of 25 bpm 
and  a  short  period  of  asystole  combined  with  presyncope  and  needed  assistance  from  health 
professionals. This subject has a baseline HR of 60 BPM. In the SmPC it is recommended that patients 
with sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history 
of myocardial infarction or heart failure should be observed for a period of 6 hours after the first dose of 
siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia (see SmPC section 4.4).  
QTc  interval:  A  thorough QT  study  was  conducted  (study  A2118).  No  effect  of  siponimod  on  the  QTc 
interval  was  detected.  The  metabolites,  M3  and  M5,  showed  a  negative  correlation  with  QTcF.  The 
metabolite M17 was not assessed in this study, however QTc in patients exposed to long term treatment 
of  siponimod  is  similar  to  the  dedicated  QTc  study,  metabolites  are  not  expected  to  have  significant 
effects on the QTc interval.   
•  Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In study A2116 concomitant treatment with siponimod and propranolol decreased the heart rate with an 
average of 6 bpm compared with propranolol alone. Compared with placebo, the decrease in heart rate 
was markedly higher (12.3 to 14.7 bpm). This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

•  Genetic differences 
In Study A2128 patients with genotype CYP2C9*3*3 had around 3 bpm lower heart rate on each day of 
uptitration compare to genotype CYP2C9*1*1. This is in line with the pharmacokinetic results. In SmPC 
section 4.4, it is mentioned that siponimod should not be used in patients with genotype CYP2C9*3*3 
due to increased plasma concentrations of siponimod which is endorsed. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and lymphocyte count 
The concentration-effect relationship was investigated in PK/PD simulations. Figure 10 depicts the 
dose-dependent decrease in trough lymphocyte count simulated. 
Figure 10: Median simulated trough siponimod concentration versus trough lymphocyte count in 
healthy volunteers by dose 
The relationship between dose and lymphocyte counts were modelled in a PopPKPD analysis. This 
revealed a dose response relationship. It supported that weight did not impact lymphocyte count to a 
clinically relevant degree. Further, it revealed a small but not clinically relevant impact of Japanese 
origin and gender.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology program of siponimod contributing to PK data consisted of 15 phase 1 studies 
in  healthy  subjects  or  special  populations.  Additionally,  three  phase  2  studies  in  polymyositis  and 
dermatomyositis patients, one phase 2 study in RRMS patients, and one phase 3 study in SPMS patients 
contributed with data to the PK programme.  
The  population  PK  model  for  siponimod  is  generally  acceptable.  A  PBPK  model  was  developed  for 
prediction of drug-drug interactions of siponimod.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 46/163 
 
  
  
 
Besides one study (study A2102), the clinical studies were considered well conducted. The multiple dose 
studies (A2102) found up to 17 times higher plasma concentrations than anticipated in the 10 mg and 
20 mg cohort, indicative of a more than 10 times higher doses than anticipated. The applicant informs 
that there was evidence of erroneous dosing.  
Bioequivalence between the final market image and the market formulation was shown.  
ADME 
The median siponimod Tmax ranged from 3 - 6 hours. The absolute oral bioavailability of siponimod is 
approximately 84%. Siponimod concentration increases in an apparent dose proportional manner after 
multiple  once-daily  doses  of  siponimod  0.3 mg  to  20 mg.  Despite  a  delay  in  Tmax  to  8 hours  after  a 
single dose, food intake had no effect on the systemic exposure of siponimod.   
Siponimod  is  distributed  to  body  tissues  with  a  moderate  mean  volume  of  distribution  of  124 litres. 
Protein  binding  of  siponimod  is  >99.9%  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  patients  with  hepatic  or  renal 
impairment. 
Siponimod is extensively metabolised, mainly by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), and to a lesser extent 
by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Genetic polymorphism of CYP2C9 has a great influence on the overall 
metabolism,  therefore  knowledge  of  metaboliser  status  (extensive,  intermediate  or  poor)  is  required 
before initiation of treatment. The influence of the genotypes *1/*3 and *2/*3 are reflected in the SmPC 
with reduction in dose to 1 mg QD maintenance treatment.   The combination of siponimod with moderate 
or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 duel inhibitor should be avoided irrespective 
of the CYP2C9 genotype. 
The pharmacological activity of the main metabolites M3 and M17 is not expected to contribute to the 
clinical effect and the safety of siponimod in humans. Large accumulation factors have been estimated 
for P29.6 and P30.5, but the metabolite to parent AUCtau,ss ratios were low, and the metabolites did 
only contribute marginally to the total exposure. 
Siponimod  is  eliminated  from  the  systemic  circulation  mainly  due  to  metabolism  and  subsequent 
biliary/faecal  excretion.  The  apparent  elimination  half-life  of  siponimod  is  approximately  30 hours. 
Steady state was reached after approximately 6 days of multiple once-daily administration of siponimod.  
Special populations 
No elderly patients were enrolled in clinical studies. Siponimod should be used with caution in patients 
aged 61 years and over.  
The safety and efficacy of Mayzent in children and adolescents have not yet been established. Results 
from  population  pharmacokinetics  suggest  that  gender  based  dose  adjustment  is  not  necessary.  The 
single-dose  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  not  different  between  Japanese  and  Caucasian  healthy 
subjects, indicating absence of ethnic sensitivity on the pharmacokinetics of siponimod. 
No siponimod dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. 
Siponimod  must  not  be  used  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  No  dose  adjustments  for 
siponimod are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
A  larger  inter-subject  variability  was  identified  with  increasing  dose,  in  genotype  CYP2C9*3*3  and  in 
Caucasians  (compared  with  Japanese).  Based  on  pooled  data  from  the  target  population  and  RRMS 
patients, the inter-subject variability was larger in MS patients compared with healthy subjects. Based 
on the PopPK model, the coefficient of variation for Cl/F was 24.2% in SPMS patients. This is similar to 
the values of healthy subjects suggesting similar inter-individual variability in SPMS patients and healthy 
subjects.  Health  status  was  not  a  significant  covariate  in  the  Pop  PK  model.  This  supports  that  data 
obtained in healthy volunteers can be extrapolated to the target population and RRMS patients.

Interactions 
No  clinical  interaction  studies  were  performed  with  siponimod  as  a  perpetrator  of  DDI.  No  dedicated 
studies were conducted to evaluate siponimod as a substrate for transporters in vitro. Intestinal uptake 
of siponimod studied in Caco-2 cells indicated passive permeation is the uptake mechanism.  
Metabolite  M3  showed  no  significant  inhibition  or  induction  of  any  CYPs  tested  in-vitro.  M3  was  an 
inhibitor  of  human  BSEP,  OCT1  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3  in  vitro.  Metabolite  M17  showed  no  relevant 
inhibition of the tested transporters. 
Smoking is a potent CYP1A1 inducer and smoking status was shown by PK/PD analysis to have no impact 
on siponimod exposure on mean data from SPMS patients. 
Impact  of  the  six  different  CYP2C9  genotypes  on  siponimod  PK  and  the  drug  interaction  potential  in 
presence of perpetrators for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4: itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine 
rifampicin, erythromycin, and efavirenz were evaluated in silico using SimCyp. Itraconazole, fluconazole 
and  rifampicin  predictions  were  backed  up  by  in  vivo  DDI  data  with  siponimod.  There  was  initially  a 
mismatch  between  simulated  and  observed  data  for  the  interaction  with  itraconazole,  however  PBPK 
simulation including both CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 metabolic pathways could better explain the observed in 
vivo results. The impact of ketoconazole, another strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, on siponimod exposure was 
predicted by SimCYP to be low for genotype *1*1 but high for genotype *3*3, a group of patients for 
whom  siponimod  is  not  indicated  due  to  the  increased  plasma  concentrations  of  siponimod.  A  similar 
result was obtained for erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
In  vivo,  the  potent  CYP2C9  inhibitor  fluconazole  could  increase  the  AUC  of  siponimod  2-fold  and  the 
Cmax by 10%. In vivo, itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreased siponimod AUCs by 10% and 
24% in subjects with the CYP2C9*1*2 and *1*3 genotypes, respectively. Concomitant administration of 
rifampin, a moderate CYP2C9/strong CYP3A4 inducer, significantly decreased the steady-state exposure 
of siponimodand concomitant use of siponimod and rifampin or other inducers of CYP3A4/CYP2C9 should 
be avoided. Co-administration with an oral contraceptive did not cause relevant changes to exposure of 
ethinylestradiol or PD parameters.  
Siponimod  is  classified  as  a  biopharmaceutics  classification  system  (BCS)  class  II  compound  and 
practically insoluble in aqueous buffer pH 1 to 6.8. Potential effect of drugs which increased gastric pH 
was not investigated.  
Pharmacodynamics 
As a selective S1P receptor modulator, siponimod induces internalization and degradation of the S1P1 
receptor and thereby acts as a functional antagonist on S1P1. The resulting absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC) reduction in peripheral blood due to prevention of lymphocyte recirculation from lymphatic tissue 
to target organs constitutes the primary efficacy-related PD endpoint of siponimod. 
Five  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  conducted:  three  studies  dedicated  to  the  negative  chronotropic 
effect of siponimod, one study examining the T-cell dependent and independent antigen stimuli, and one 
dedicated  QTc  study.  Furthermore,  several  pharmacokinetic  studies  contributed  with  data  to  the 
pharmacodynamic assessment. Data about possible genetic differences on PD response are limited. It is 
theoretically possible that genetic differences of the Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor exist that could 
influence  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  siponimod.  However,  available  scientific  data  do  not  suggest  that 
such an effect would be clinically relevant.  
Primary pharmacology 
The single dose study showed a dose dependent decline in absolute lymphocyte count between 0.3 mg 
to 10 mg where the decline levelled off. The recovery of the lymphocytes was seen after 48 days, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 48/163 
 
  
due to a half-life of 27 to 57 hours a once daily dose regimen was selected. One of the multiple dose 
studies also showed a dose related reduction in the mean ALC, mean ALC nadir and mean AUEC0-12h, 
over  the  dose  range  of  BAF312  0.3  mg  to  20  mg.  The  absolute  lymphocyte  counts  recovered  to  the 
baseline value at end of study.  
Following treatment with siponimod 2 mg (the proposed dose for the majority of patients) in multiple 
dose studies, an absolute lymphocyte count of 0.2 to 1.2 x 109/L was seen in 87.9% of the subjects. In 
subjects treated with siponimod 2 mg preceded by dose titration, lymphocyte counts between 0.2 and 
1.2  x  109/L  were  seen  in  73.3%  of  the  subjects.  Even  though  the  defined  therapeutic  absolute 
lymphocyte  count  is  <  1.2  ×  109/L,  clinically  relevant  disease  modifying  effects  remain  present  even 
with  lymphocyte  counts  above  1.2  ×  109/L.  No  individuals  in  the  treatment  with  siponimod  2  mg 
experienced lymphocyte counts below 0.2 x 109/L.   
Regarding CD4+ and CD8+ cells, a dose-dependent reduction was observed subsequent to siponimod 
administration. Within 40 days, both the CD4+ and CD8+ counts appeared to normalize irrespective of 
siponimod dose. Besides subjects in the 20 mg dose group, all subjects in study A2105 demonstrated 
recovery of lymphocyte count by 14 days post-dose. Subjects receiving BAF312 20 mg have on average 
reached 83 % of the Day-1 value. In poor metabolisers (CYP2C9*2*3 and CYP2C9*3*3) the percentage 
of  lymphocytes  are  lower  compared  with  extensive  metabolisers  (CYP2C9*1*1).  The  relationship 
between  dose  and  lymphocyte  counts  were  modelled  in  a  PopPKPD  analysis.  This  revealed  a  dose 
response relationship. It supported that weight did not impact lymphocyte count to a clinically relevant 
degree.  Nadir  lymphocyte  count  depends  on  weight,  gender  ethnicity,  healthy  status,  and  CYP2C9 
genotype. Lymphocyte recovery time depends on weight, gender, health status, and CYP2C9 genotype. 
Additional  simulations  for  patients  meeting  more  than  one  of  the  investigated  characteristics  (e.g. 
Japanese, female patient of 49 kg genotyped CYP2C9 *1/*3) showed a lymphocyte count of 0.31 x 109/L 
compared with 0.56 x 109/L in a typical patient. Furthermore, the recovery time to absolute lymphocyte 
counts of 1.0 x 109/L was 17 days for Japanese female patients of 49 kg genotyped 2*3* compared with 
5 days in a typical patient.  
The  metabolite  M3  was  not  pharmacologically  active.  In  contrast,  metabolite  M17  contributed  around 
3% to the pharmacological activity on S1P1 and S1P5.  
Secondary pharmacology 
A negative chronotropic effect of siponimod was established based on 14 studies. The drop in heart rate 
was larger with increasing dose and levelled off at around siponimod 10 mg. A dose titration regimen up 
to siponimod 10 mg showed that the drop in heart rate was smaller during slow uptitration than initiation 
with siponimod 10 mg. Dose titration up to 2 mg (the proposed dose for the majority of patients) was 
not compared with initiation of siponimod 2 mg. A dose titration regimen is proposed in the SmPC. A 
drop in heart rate of 16-20 BPM was seen, but compared with placebo, the decrease in heart rate was 
4.1  bpm.  The  magnitude  of  the  negative  chronotropic  effects  at  BAF312  re-initiation  appeared  to  be 
dependent  on  both  the  dose  and  the  duration  of  treatment  discontinuation.  The  2  mg  dose  (the 
recommended treatment dose) showed a maximum absolute heart rate decrease of 14.2 bpm (90% CI: 
12.0;16.5) with 72 hours pause and a decrease of 18.0 bpm (90% CI: 15.6;20.3) with 192 hours pause. 
Treatment should be re-initiated with a titration phase following discontinuation of treatment for 4 or 
more consecutive days. 
Two  modified  release  formulations  were  examined,  but  there  were  no  differences  in  the  negative 
chronotropic effect compared with the immediate release formulations. Therefore, the immediate release 
formulations were carried forward. 
Besides bradycardia, asystole has been seen in a healthy well-trained subject with low baseline heart 
rate  (60  bpm).  As  a  recognition  of  the  negative  dromotropic  effect,  in  the  SmPC  section  4.4,  it  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 49/163 
 
  
recommended that patients with sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), first- or second-degree [Mobitz 
type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure should be observed for a period of 
6 hours after the first dose of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia. Concomitant treatment 
with  siponimod  and  propranolol  decreased  the  heart  rate  with  an  average  of  6  bpm  compared  with 
propranolol alone. Compared with placebo, the decrease in heart rate was markedly higher (12.3 to 14.7 
bpm). Siponimod on top of propranolol was associated with a larger decrease in heart rate at day 20 
compared with propranolol on top of siponimod treatment. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
The dedicated QTc study demonstrated no significant direct QT prolonging effect of siponimod and did 
not suggest an arrhythmogenic potential related to QT prolongation. A small increase in QTc was however 
seen with a peak at 3 hours post dose which corresponds to the Cmax. The upper boundary of the 90% 
CI did not exceed 10 ms. The applicant has included a warning in the SmPC section 4.4. The metabolites, 
M3 and M5, showed a negative correlation with QTcF. The metabolite M17 was not assessed in this study, 
however QTc in patients exposed to long term treatment of siponimod is similar to the dedicated QTc 
study, metabolites are not expected to have significant effects on the QTc interval.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Methodologically,  the  clinical  studies  supporting  this  application  were  overall  well  conducted,  and  the 
pharmacokinetic  models  developed  were  in  general  considered  acceptable.  The  PK  of  siponimod  is 
considered adequately described. The pharmacological profile of siponimod in human studies has been 
adequately  documented  and  meet  the  requirements  to  support  the  application.  The  proposed  clinical 
dose of siponimod 2 mg preceded by 5 days up-titration is documented. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The following indication was initially applied: Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). 
The clinical development program comprises two controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of siponimod in MS patients: 
- a phase 3 study (A2304, N=1651) testing one dose level of siponimod (2 mg) was performed in 
SPMS.  
- a phase 2 dose - ranging study (A2201, N=297) was performed in RRMS.

2.5.1.  Dose response study (Study A2201) 
The dose-response relationship was elucidated in study A2201 in a different patient population (RRMS) 
and mainly with respect to MRI endpoints rather than clinical endpoints. 
Methods 
Study A2201 was a multi-center phase II adaptive dose-ranging, randomised, double-blind, parallel-
group,  placebo-controlled,  study  evaluating  safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  on  MRI  lesion  parameters 
and determining the dose response curve of siponimod given orally once daily in patients with RRMS. 
Two patient groups were tested sequentially, separated by an interim analysis (IA). The first group of 
patients (Period 1) was randomized in a 1:1:1:1 fashion to treatment with three doses of siponimod (10 
mg, 2 mg and 0.5 mg given orally o.d.) or placebo for a period 6 months. After IA, the second group of 
patients (Period 2) was randomised (4:4:1) to two additional doses of siponimod, 1.25 mg and 0.25mg, 
as defined on the basis of the IA results, and placebo. These patients were treated for 3 months. Patients 
who completed the study were eligible to enter the Extension study that allows all placebo patients to 
be switched to siponimod, and patients already on a dose of siponimod to continue active treatment. A 
sample size of 275 randomised patients (250 completers) was targeted.

Males or females aged 18 to 55 years inclusive with a diagnosis of RRMS as  defined by 2005 revised 
McDonald criteria, and a RRMS course with at least one documented relapse during the previous year or 
two documented relapses during the previous 2 years prior to randomisation, or a positive Gd-enhanced 
MRI scan at screening (in case the first  MRI scan obtained at screening was  negative, a second scan 
could  be  obtained  1  month  later).  Patients  were  to  have  an Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale  (EDSS) 
score of 0 to 5.0 inclusive, and to be neurologically stable with no evidence of relapse or corticosteroid 
treatment within 30 days prior to randomisation. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the number  of combined unique  active lesions  (CUAL)  defined  as  new  Gd-
enhanced lesions on T1-weighted, or new or newly enlarging lesions on T2-weighted MRI scans without 
double counting. Other endpoints included additional MRI outcomes and annualized relapse rate (ARR) 
at 3 and 6 months.  
Figure 11: Study A2201 study design 
Results 
The study population had a mean age of 36 years, a median disease duration ranging from 4.7 to 7.6 
years, and a mean EDSS baseline score of approximately 2.3. 
Primary dose-response results 
• 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  met  as  demonstrated  by  a  statistically  significant  dose-
response  relationship  among  the  five  doses  of  siponimod  (10mg,  2mg,  1.25mg,  0.5mg  and 
0.25mg)  and  placebo  during  3  months  of  treatment  in  patients  with  RRMS,  measured  by  the 
number of CUAL lesions (p=0.0001 for the Emax model).

Table 5: Testing significance of candidate dose response models at 3 months (Full Analysis Set) 
• 
The  estimated  dose-response  curve  using  the  model  specified  in  the  primary  analysis  of  the 
protocol estimated the dose which provides a 50% reduction over placebo as 0.38mg with a 95% 
confidence interval of 0.02 to infinity. 
•  Based on the dose-response curve at Month 3 from the Bayesian longitudinal model, the dose 
providing 50% reduction over placebo was estimated as 0.51mg, with a 95% confidence interval 
of 0.19 to 1.34. siponimod treatment reduced up to 80% of CUAL vs. placebo, with 10 and 2mg 
doses forming an upper plateau of the dose-response curve. 
• 
The mean number of CUAL at Month 6 in the full analysis set was 0.4, 0.4, 0.9, and 2.0 for the 
siponimod 10mg, 2mg and 0.5mg groups and for the placebo group, respectively. The respective 
results in the per-protocol set were 0.4, 0.5, 1.8 and 1.9 for siponimod 10mg, 2mg, 0.5mg and 
placebo at Month 6. 
Secondary variables 
•  ARR  were  0.30,  0.20  and  0.61  for  10mg,  2mg  and  0.5mg  treatment  groups  respectively  (only 
doses with 6-month data) vs. 0.58 for placebo. The analyses of ARR up to Month 6 showed superiority 
of the siponimod 2mg group compared to placebo. 
• The proportion of relapse-free patients up to Month 6 was superior in the siponimod 2mg group 
compared to placebo. 
• The numbers of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions at Month 3 compared to baseline were lower for 
the siponimod 10mg, 2mg, and 1.25mg treatment groups compared to placebo. The results seen at 
Month 6 showed a difference for the siponimod 10mg and the 2mg group compared to placebo. 
• The mean number of new Gd-enhanced T1 lesions at Month 6 was lower in the siponimod groups 
than in the placebo group. The siponimod 10mg and 1.25mg groups at Month 3 and the siponimod 
10mg and 0.5mg groups at Month 6 all demonstrated superiority over placebo. 
•  The  effect  on  all  post-baseline  Gd-enhanced  T1-weighted  lesions  was  in  line  with  the  results 
obtained  for  new  Gd-enhanced  T1  lesions.  The  siponimod  groups  10mg,  2mg,  and  0.5mg  after  6 
months as well as 1.25mg after 3 months all demonstrated superiority over placebo. Superiority was 
also demonstrated for the siponimod 10mg, 2mg, and 0.5mg groups versus placebo at Month 3. 
•  The  proportion  of  patients  without  any  new  MRI  disease  activity  (CUAL)  up  to  3  and  6  months 
(sensitivity  with  weight)  reached  statistical  significance  in  siponimod  2mg  (p=0.020)  and  1.25mg 
(p=0.001) groups at 3 months and in the siponimod 2mg group (p=0.022) at 6 months compared 
to placebo.

of treatment. Patients spent a median of 24 months in the dose-blinded phase followed by an open-label 
phase (duration approximately 3 years). In the dose-blinded phase, patients received the dose to which 
they were assigned to in the core part of A2201, while patients on placebo were randomised to one of 
the five doses in a blinded manner. All patients were switched to open-label siponimod 2 mg after the 
database lock of the core study. As to be expected for the RRMS population, EDSS remained relatively 
stable from core part throughout the extension part. A majority of patients remained free from events 
of 6m-CDP throughout the study. For relapse-related parameters ARR and proportion of patients free of 
confirmed relapses, the 1.25 mg and 2 mg dose group continued to perform better than the highest and 
the lowest dose groups during the dose-blinded part, while convergence could be observed during the 
open-label part when all subjects continued to receive 2 mg siponimod. The number of Gd-enhancing 
and  new  or  enlarging  T2  lesions  remained  low  throughout  the  extension  study  lacking  a  clear  dose-
relation. 
2.5.2.  Main study (Study A2304) 
Methods 
This  was  the  only  study  in  the  SPMS  indication.  The  study  design  consisted  of  a  Core  Part  and  an 
Extension  Part.  The  Core  Part  was  a  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-
controlled, variable treatment duration study comparing the efficacy and safety of siponimod in patients 
with SPMS. Eligible patients were randomised to siponimod or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The Core Part of 
the study was to be stopped approximately 3 years after the randomisation of the first patient. It was 
predicted  that,  by  that  time,  the  required  number  of  374  patients  with  3-month  confirmed  disability 
progression (3m-CDP) (primary endpoint) would be observed and more than 95% of patients would have 
been randomised for 1 year or more. 
During the Extension Part, eligible patients were to receive open-label siponimod. The Extension Part of 
the study was ongoing at the time of the interim report.  
Figure 12: A2303 core and extended study design  
Study Participants 
Patients were recruited in 294 specialised centers in 31 countries across 5 continents. Approximately 
78% of patients were recruited in the EU, and the study results are thus considered relevant for the 
European population.

or matched placebo) tablets once daily during the Treatment Epoch, preferably at the same time each 
day. The protocol recommended that study medication be taken in the morning. Study treatment could 
be administered with or without food. The first dose was taken while the patient was in the clinic and 
specific monitoring procedures were required. The titration regimens are provided below:

Re-titration was required for patients who missed 4 or more consecutive doses while on maintenance 
dose or patients who missed one dose or more during dose titration. 
Patients with 6-month CDP (6m-CDP) were informed of the potential options as follows: 
•  Continue blinded study treatment assignment (no change). 
•  Discontinue  blinded  study  treatment  and  switch  to  open-label  siponimod.  These  patients 
underwent dose titration to the 2 mg dose. 
•  Discontinue  blinded  study  treatment  and  start  any  other  MS  treatment  continuing  under  the 
abbreviated visit schedule.

For all 3 options, randomised treatment allocation remained blinded until the conclusion of the Core Part. 
For  treatment  of  MS  relapses,  a  standard  course  of  intravenous  corticosteroids  (up  to  1000  mg/day 
methylprednisolone for 3-5 days) was permitted.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the time to 3m-CDP in patients with SPMS as measured by EDSS. The 
EDSS was assessed, based on neurological examination, by the Independent EDSS Rater every 3 
months and in the case of a suspected MS relapse. The EDSS uses an ordinal scale to assess 
neurologic impairment in MS based on a neurological examination. Disability progression was defined 
as an increase from baseline of: 
•  1 point in patients with a Baseline EDSS score of 3.0 to 5.0, or 
•  0.5 point in patients with a Baseline EDSS score of 5.5 to 6.5. 
Sustained disability progression for 3m-CDP was determined by confirming that the criterion was also 
met at visits 3 months later with any intervening EDSS values also meeting the criterion for change. 
EDSS scores used for confirmation of disability progression were to be obtained outside any ongoing 
relapse. In this context, the maximum duration of a relapse was defined as 90 days. 
The first key secondary endpoint is T25W measured the time, in seconds, to walk 25 feet (7.62 
meters). Two trials of the T25W were performed at each assessment and the T25W score was derived 
as the mean of both trials. Patients who were unable to complete both trials due to physical limitation 
were considered to have worsened at that visit. If only one trial was available, this was used in the 
assessment of disability progression, even if the other trial was not available due to physical limitation. 
A 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the T25W was defined as a decrease 
from baseline sustained for at least 3 months. The steps to identify 3-month confirmed worsening were 
similar to the process described for the 3m-CDP using EDSS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 58/163 
 
  
The second key secondary endpoint is change from baseline in the T2 lesion volume. An MRI 
Manual that outlined technical implementation, image quality requirements, and MRI administrative 
procedures was provided to the study coordinator and MRI technician (or another designated person). 
All scans were also to be assessed by the central blinded MRI reading center for quality, completeness, 
and adherence to the MRI Manual. If a scan was incomplete or incorrectly performed, the study center 
was asked to repeat it as soon as possible. After completion of the quality check, all scans were 
analysed according to a standardized procedure. 
Detection of progression 
All available post-baseline EDSS scores (scheduled or unscheduled) were evaluated to assess if the 
change from baseline met the disability progression criterion. The first EDSS assessment that met the 
criterion defined the onset of tentative disability progression. 
Confirmation of progression 
Progression was confirmed if a subsequent scheduled visit at least 3 months after onset showed 
progression and every EDSS score (scheduled or unscheduled) obtained between the onset and 
confirmation visits also met the progression criterion. Only the EDSS assessments obtained at 
scheduled visits (including follow-up visits) and in the absence of relapse (confirmed or unconfirmed) 
were to be used for confirmation of progression. 
By definition, a relapse could not last longer than 90 days. If the relapse end date was missing or 
indicated a duration longer than 90 days, a relapse duration of 90 days was assumed for determining 
whether the EDSS assessment was obtained in the absence of relapse. For patients with confirmed 
progression, the time to 3m-CDP was calculated from the date of Day 1 to the date of the CDP onset. 
Relapses 
MS relapse was defined as appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously 
stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of 
a preceding clinical demyelinating event. Additionally, the abnormality must have been present for at 
least 24 hours and occurred in the absence of fever (<37.5°C) or known infection.  
The assessment, management, and reporting of MS relapse was done by the Primary Treating 
Physician. The treating physician assessed whether the neurological abnormality was consistent with 
the definition of MS relapse, and if so, the standard neurological examination (for the EDSS score) was 
to be performed by the Independent EDSS Rater.  
A confirmed MS relapse was defined as accompanied by a clinically-relevant change in the EDSS 
performed by the Independent EDSS Rater. 
The following relapse variables were analysed: 
•  ARR (all relapses and confirmed relapses) 
• 
• 
Time to first relapse 
Proportion of patients free of relapses. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 30% reduction in the risk of 3m-CDP (hazard 
ratio of 0.70), using a log-rank test with 2-sided alpha level of 5% and 2:1 randomization of siponimod 
to placebo. Assuming a 2-year proportion with disability progression of 0.30 in the placebo group, a 2-
year  drop-out  rate  of  20%,  and  an  enrolment  rate  of  100  patients  per  month,  1530  patients  and  an 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 59/163 
 
  
overall study duration of approximately 42 months were required to observe at least 374 patients with 
disability progression, which would give the required power.  
The  protocol  was  amended  to  update  the  criterion  for  stopping  the  Core  Part  of  the  study  from  374 
patients with 3m-CDP had been observed (original plan) to approximately 3 years after randomization 
of the first patient and at least 374 events observed. At approximately 3 years, it was expected that 
more  than  374  patients  with  3m-  CDP  had  been  observed.  This  was  expected  to  compensate  for  the 
slight power loss due to the alpha adjustment for the interim analysis and a power of at least 90% was 
expected at the end of the Core Part. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation to one of the two treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio (Siponimod: Placebo) was stratified by 
country using a blocked randomisation. Some countries may have contributed few patients.  
Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blinded to 
the identity of the treatment from the time of randomisation until database lock of the Core Part, using 
the following methods: 
1.  Randomisation  data  were  kept  strictly  confidential  until  the  time  of  unblinding,  and  were  not 
accessible by anyone else involved in the study with the following exceptions: 
DMC members, Independent Statisticians and Independent Programmers, 
PK  analysts  had  access  to  the  randomisation  codes  associated  with  patients  from  whom  PK 
samples were taken, who kept the PK results confidential until database lock. 
2.  The identity of the treatments was concealed by the use of study drugs that were identical in 
packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste, and odour. 
Unblinding was permitted in the case of patient emergencies and at the conclusion of Core Part of the 
study. 
There were three independent teams with access to different dataset to preserve the blind conduction 
of the trial. As per protocol, the first dose administrator/team was responsible for the dose initiation 
and had access to the first dose database. The primary treating physician/team, who was responsible 
for the clinical management of the patient including the assessment, management, and reporting of 
MS relapse (if needed) had access to the main database as per protocol. The EDSS rater was 
responsible for EDSS assessment and had only access to the Neurostatus e-scoring dataset.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets: 
•  All Screened Subjects Set (SCR): comprised all patients who were screened. 
•  Randomised Analysis Set (RAN): consisted of all randomised patients. 
•  Full Analysis Set (FAS): comprised all randomised patients with assigned treatments who took 
at least one dose of study medication. All available efficacy assessments were used, irrespective 
of the study treatment received. The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses. 
•  Modified Full Analysis Set (MFAS): comprised all randomised patients with assigned treatments 
who  took  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  If  a  patient  prematurely  discontinued  study 
treatment and started a new MS-DMT or open-label siponimod, efficacy assessments were only 
used up to the start of the new MS-DMT or open-label siponimod. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 60/163 
 
  
• 
Per-protocol Set (PPS): consisted of all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol 
deviations that could have confounded the interpretation of analyses conducted on the FAS.  
•  Safety  Set  (SAF):  comprised  all  patients  who  received  at least one  dose  of  study  medication. 
Patients were analyzed according to the actual treatment received, using all available data up to 
and  including  30  days  after  last  dose  of  study  drug  or  the  day  before  start  of  open-label 
siponimod, whatever came first. The SAF was used for all safety analyses. 
•  Open-label  Set  (OLS):  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  open-label 
siponimod in the Core Part.  
• 
Follow-up Set (FUS): consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication 
and had follow-up assessments (i.e., had off-drug evaluations/assessments after end of study 
drug). However, for patients who received at least one dose of open-label siponimod, off-drug 
evaluations/assessments were only included in this analysis if performed prior to the first dose 
of open-label siponimod; likewise, off-drug assessments after exposure to open-label siponimod 
were not included. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Set: included all patients with PK data. 
Blinded sample size review: 
A blinded sample size review was performed prior to the unblinded futility interim analysis. Prior to the 
completion of enrollment, a review of pooled disability progression data (based on EDSS) was performed 
to re-assess the assumptions of the disability progression sample size calculation. After the results of 
the blinded size became available it was decided to proceed as planned in the protocol. 
Interim analysis: 
Regular interim semi-blinded analyses of safety data were provided to the DMC (approximately twice a 
year).  Also,  one  interim  analysis  for  a  futility  assessment  was  provided.  The  protocol  allowed,  at  the 
interim analysis, an assessment for stopping the trial early for efficacy to be  made using an O’Brien-
Fleming  boundary  using  a  Lan-DeMets  alpha  spending  function.  However,  prior  to  the  futility  interim 
analysis being performed it was decided that even if this stopping boundary was reached the study was 
to continue in order to allow the collection of sufficient long-term safety and efficacy data. The futility 
interim analysis was to be performed when at least 50% of the required numbers of patients with 3m-
CDP were available in the database. Novartis did not get access to the unblinded results while Core Part 
was ongoing. The DMC recommended that the study should proceed, i.e. it should not be stopped for 
futility. 
Control of the type I error due to multiple endpoints: 
The overall significance level for the primary endpoint is 0.05. The first hypothesis was performed at a 
two-sided significance level adjusted according to the O’Brien-Fleming alpha level correction which was 
calculated to be 0.0434. The alpha was adjusted since an interim analysis was performed.  
A hierarchical testing procedure was implemented for the primary and key secondary endpoints, which 
were tested in the following order: 
1. Time to 3m-CDP based on EDSS 
2. Time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in T25W 
3. Change from baseline in T2 lesion volume 
The second and third hypothesis tests were performed at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 61/163 
 
  
Additional secondary end points were evaluated at a nominal significance level of 0.05 without correction 
for multiplicity, or hierarchical testing. 
Primary endpoint: 3m-CDP using the EDSS scale: 
The null hypothesis tested that there was no difference in the time to 3m-CDP between the siponimod 
and placebo group versus the alternative hypothesis that there was a difference between the groups.  
The  hypothesis  was  tested  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with treatment,  country,  baseline 
EDSS (continuous scale) and SPMS group (with or without superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to 
the  screening)  as  covariates.  The  estimated  hazard ratio  (siponimod/placebo hazard  rates)  with  95% 
Wald confidence interval was obtained. The risk reduction in percent was calculated as (1 - hazard ratio) 
x 100. 
The  primary  analysis  of  the  time  to  3m-CDP  used  all  available  data  from  all  patients  in  the  FAS, 
irrespective  of  premature discontinuation  from  study  medication.  Patients  who  did  not  reach  3m-CDP 
during the study were censored at the latest date known to be at risk (defined in the FAS as the date of 
the last EDSS assessment). 
Supportive analysis for the primary endpoint 
•  Kaplan-Meier estimates (with 95% confidence intervals) were summarized at Month 12, Month 
24, and Month 36. Kaplan-Meier curve were also presented. Log-rank tests were reported. 
• 
The  proportional  hazard  assumptions  were  evaluated  using  1)  graphical  methods;  2)  an 
interaction term between time and treatment. 
•  An analysis of 3m-CDP sustained until end of Core Part was performed post-hoc as a supportive 
analysis. An additional exploratory analysis was performed for the period from study start to the 
confirmation date of the 374th event of 3-month CDP. 
• 
• 
The FAS analysis was supplemented by analyses based on the PPS. 
The FAS analysis was also supplemented by an MFAS analysis. For the MFAS analysis, onset of 
disability  progression  could  not  have  occurred  after  the  first  dose  of  MS-DMT  (or  open-label 
siponimod treatment). 
Sensitivity analyses and handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations for the primary 
endpoint  
For the FAS, MFAS, and PPS, patients who did not have an EDSS assessment after the first dose of study 
drug were censored at Day 1. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on the FAS, using 3 predefined assumptions for determination of 
confirmed progression: 
1.  One sensitivity analysis assumed that all patients with a start of a tentative disability progression 
based on EDSS, who discontinued the Core Part prematurely within the 3-month confirmation 
interval, had confirmed progression based on EDSS.  
2.  A  second  sensitivity  analysis  assumed  that  all  patients  who  discontinued  the  Core  Part 
prematurely for reasons related to lack of efficacy without reaching the endpoint had confirmed 
progression based on EDSS at the time they stopped study participation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 62/163 
 
  
 
3.  A third sensitivity analysis assumed that all patients who discontinued the Core Part prematurely 
without  reaching  the  endpoint  had  confirmed  progression  based  on  EDSS  at  the  time  they 
stopped study participation.  
4.  A  fourth  sensitivity  analysis  assumed  that  post-baseline  EDSS  assessments  that  were 
documented on the EDSS cover page but were not transferred in the database were considered 
to  have  met  the  disease  progression.The  EDSS  data  were  collected  in  a  vendor  database, 
transferred  to  the  Novartis  database,  and  the  transferred  data  were  used  for  the  statistical 
analysis.  After  reconciliation  with  the  Novartis  eCRF  data,  unresolved  discrepancies  were 
identified,  including  mislabeled  visits  and  EDSS  assessments  documented  on  the  eCRF  cover 
page that were not loaded in the Novartis database. To evaluate robustness of the EDSS results, 
an additional sensitivity analysis was performed. 
A  number  of  protocol  deviations  and  other  irregularities  occurred  during  the  study.  A  pre-planned 
sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the potential bias introduced by subjects for whom the 
main investigator conducted EDSS assessment, or for whom the independent EDSS rater had access to 
the  cardiac  monitoring  database.  In  this  analysis,  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  excluding  these 
patients for whom the EDSS rater had access to potentially unblinding information (identified based on 
the corresponding protocol deviation and during the MAA procedure) were performed. The comparison 
of the 3m-CDP in the potentially unblinded group of patients indicated an apparent much larger treatment 
effect  than  in  the  overall  study  population  (HR  approximately  0.4  as  compared  to  an  overall  HR  of 
approximately 0.8). A number of comprehensible factors that could have influenced or contributed to 
the observed imbalances in the CDP results were identified, e.g. a greater effect on CDP in the potentially 
affected  subgroup  of  patients  compared  to  the  non-affected  population  and  the  overall  population. 
Additional  analyses  also  suggest  that  potential  unblinding  did  not  influence  treatment  decisions  and 
ratings.  
First key secondary variable: Time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in 
T25W 
A 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the T25W was defined as a decrease 
from baseline sustained for at least 3 months.  
The hypothesis of no difference in T25W was tested using a Cox proportional hazards model.  The Cox 
model included treatment, country/region, SPMS group (with-/without superimposed relapses in the 2 
years  prior  to  screening), baseline  EDSS  (continuous  scale)  and  baseline  T25W  (continuous  scale)  as 
covariates.  The  hazard  ratio  was  estimated,  a  log-rank  test  was  performed,  and  Kaplan-Meier  curves 
and  estimates  were  presented.  Kaplan-Meier  and  log-rank  test  analyses  did  not  include  patients  with 
missing baseline assessments who were censored at baseline.  
The FAS analysis was supplemented by analyses based on the MFAS and PPS as well as by sensitivity 
analyses. 
Second key secondary variable: change from baseline in T2 lesion volume 
All available data from the FAS were included in the primary analysis of the change from baseline in T2 
lesion volume. For MRI assessments, not all patients had Month 24 assessments, and few were expected 
to have Month 36 assessments. 
The change from baseline in T2 lesion volume (second key secondary variable) at Month 12, Month 24 
and  Month  36  was  modeled  using  a  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  with  visit  as  a 
categorical factor and an unstructured covariance matrix. Covariates included treatment, country, age, 
SPMS  group  (with-/without  superimposed  relapses  in  the  2  years  prior  to  screening),  T2  volume  at 
baseline (continuous scale), and number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline (continuous scale). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 63/163 
 
  
change  from  baseline  was  assumed  to  follow  a  normal  distribution;  the  normality  assumption  of  the 
residuals was tested. 
The null hypothesis was that the difference between siponimod and placebo, averaged over Month 12 
and Month 24, was zero. Difference between siponimod and Placebo, averaged over Month 12 and Month 
24 was tested; these estimates and respective p-value were derived by appropriate contrast from the 
model. Parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methodology, whereby 
all available assessments contribute to parameter estimations. Similarly, differences in the change from 
baseline T2 lesion volume at both Month 12 and Month 24 between siponimod and placebo were tested 
using same model.  
Relapse-related variables 
The following relapse variables were analysed: 
•  ARR (all relapses and confirmed relapses) 
• 
• 
Time to first relapse 
Proportion of patients free of relapses 
ARR  was  defined  as  the  average  number  of  relapses  per  year.  ARR  was  analysed  using  a  negative 
binomial regression model with the log-link function and treatment, country, continuous baseline EDSS, 
baseline number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and SPMS group (SPMS with/without superimposed relapses 
in  the  2  years  prior  to  screening)  as  covariates.  Log  (time  in  analysis  period) was  used  as  the  offset 
variable to obtain the aggregate ARR when the number of relapses was used as the dependent variable 
in the model. 
Negative binomial regression models were also used to analyse ARR by SPMS group (SPMS with/without 
superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to screening).  
Time to first relapse was defined as the time from Day 1 until the start of relapse symptoms. Patients 
without  relapse  were  censored  at  the  latest  known  date  to  be  at  risk.  Analysis  was  done  via  a  Cox 
proportional hazards model. Hazard ratio was estimated, a log-rank test was performed, and Kaplan-
Meier curves and Kaplan-Meier estimates were presented.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 13: A2304 Study participant flow 
A  total  of  2092  subjects  were  screened  to  participate  in  study  A2304  and  1651  were  enrolled  and 
randomized. Five subjects were randomized to siponimod but not treated, and one subject had study 
procedures performed prior to providing informed consent; therefore, the Full Analysis Set (FAS) included 
1645 subjects. The disposition of subjects is summarized in Figure 13. 
More patients in siponimod arm (66.7%) than in placebo arm (59.0%) completed the Treatment Epoch 
on  double-blind  study  drug.  After  prematurely  discontinuing  double-blind  study  drug  (32.9%  in  the 
siponimod arm, 41.0% in the placebo arm), most patients (22.7% in the siponimod arm, 27.6% in the 
placebo arm) continued in the Treatment Epoch on open-label siponimod (this option was in principle 
only  available  for  patients  with  a  CDP  event,  although  patients  without  6m-CDP  accessed  siponimod 
rescue) or on the abbreviated visit schedule, in which they did not take study medication but could take 
a  commercially  available  MS  medication.  Only  10.1%  of  siponimod  patients  and  13.4%  of  placebo 
patients  discontinued  Treatment  Epoch  directly  from  study  drug.  The  most  common  reasons  for

discontinuing the Treatment Epoch were “Subject / Guardian Decision,”, “lack of efficacy”, and “Adverse 
Event”. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations: 
Approximately 62% of the overall patient population had protocol deviations, predominantly in the 
following categories: key procedures not performed as per protocol (37.6% siponimod, 36.3% placebo) 
and other GCP deviations (28.6% and 28.0%, respectively). 
Table 7: Protocol deviations, by deviation category – any protocol deviations (RAN) 
The “other GCP deviation” category mainly refers to: 
-  Blinding  procedures  not  followed  (without  data  integrity  being  affected).  This  occurred  with 
similar incidence in each group (11.3%, 11.5% placebo). This deviation included incorrect access 
rights of the Primary Treating Physician/team to the first dose database. 
-  Dual  database  access  by  members  of  the  first  dose  team  but  integrity  of  the  study  is  not 
compromised.  This  occurred  with  similar  incidence  in  each  group  (6.2%  siponimod,  6.8% 
placebo). This deviation related to incorrect access rights of the First Dose Administrator/team 
to main database. 
-  Adjudication  outcome  (confirming  evidence  of  progression  in  the  medical  history)  was  not 
available before randomization for 5.5% of siponimod patients and 6.0% of placebo patients. 
-  A low percentage of patients with 6m-CDP in each treatment were not re-consented (within 3 
months of 6m-CDP) at the subsequent study visit (3.9% siponimod, 3.8% placebo), however, 
all patients subsequently signed the re-consent document. 
Protocol deviations reported after initial database lock 
The following protocol deviations were identified after initial Core Part database lock and included in the 
database at final core database lock: fampridine administration (either started or stopped) during the 
Core Part (9 patients (6 patients on siponimod, 3 on placebo) thus excluding them from the per protocol 
analysis) and missing serum pregnancy test at screening (4 patients, all on siponimod). There was no 
impact on safety for these patients. There were 7 patients for whom a potential unblinding issue was 
reported, however without impact on data integrity (6 patients on siponimod, 1 on placebo). Specifically, 
in 4/7 cases, the study nurse performed both main and blinded database tasks, and in 3/7 cases the

investigator had access to both the Core Part main database and Extension phase first dose database 
prior to Core Part database lock. 
According to the original study report, for 13 patients (8 siponimod, 5 placebo), EDSS raters had access 
to the Core Part of the First Dose database while they conducted EDSS assessments during the Core Part 
of the study however, there was no evidence in the electronic trail that they ever accessed the first dose 
database. 
According  to  the  clinical  study  report  amendment,  a  review  was  conducted  to  identify  cases  of  dual 
database access and GCP01 protocol deviations (PDev) were assigned to the relevant cases before the 
original Core Study DBL. As part of an internal GCP inspection, conducted after finalisation of the CSR, 
the accountable vendor was requested to resend the list of granted/revoked access rights. This list was 
found to contain additional PDev not delineated in the original list.  
According  to  the  applicant’s  position  and  data  provided  during the  OE,  213  patients  could  have  been 
potentially affected by unblinded use of inappropriate dataset. According to table 14, there were three 
potential sources for unblinded EDSS assessments in the trial including an inappropriate access of EDSS 
rater  to  the  first  dose  database  (n=13)  and/or  the  main  database  (n=57)  and  the  inappropriate 
performance  of  EDSS  assessment  by  main  database  user  (n=3).  According  to  the  applicant,  the 
inappropriate access by EDSS raters could have concerned 65 patients (Table 8).

Disease history and baseline characteristics 
With respect to MS disease history and baseline characteristics groups were generally balanced. Patient 
population  enrolled  was  consistent  with  an  early  (median  time  since  SPMS  diagnosis  2.55  years  and 
median age 49 years) moderately to severely disabled (median EDSS score of 6.0) population of SPMS. 
The SPMS population had a moderate to severe disease course (median MSSS=6 corresponding to 7th 
decile of disease severity) and nearly half of the population had focal inflammatory disease activity as 
reflected in the portion of patients with at least a relapse in the prior 2 years or at least one Gd-enhancing 
lesion at baseline. 
Prior medications 
Medications  that  were  classified  as  MS-DMTs  were  pre-defined.  As  expected  for  patients  with  SPMS 
diagnosis,  the  majority  had  such  therapies at  any  time  prior  to  study  entry:  77.8%  in  the  siponimod 
group and 79.1% in the placebo group. The list of prior therapies was manually reviewed, and a subset 
further categorized as MS-DMTs (approved for the treatment of MS) or as off-label immunosuppressants 
and  grouped  by  similar  type  in  descending  order  in  the  siponimod  group.  The  3  most  common  prior 
treatments in each treatment group were interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, 
and more than half of patients in each group had discontinued these due to lack of efficacy.

Numbers analysed 
Patients  in  the  FAS  were  analysed  according  to  the  randomised  treatment  assignment  following  the 
intention-to-treat principle (modified ITT version as only randomised patients who took at least one dose 
of study medication were included), using all available efficacy assessments, irrespective of the study 
treatment  received.  This  means  that  efficacy  data  obtained  while  patients  were  receiving  open-label 
siponimod or receiving other MS-DMT while on the abbreviated visit schedule were also included in the 
analyses of the treatment groups as randomised. 
The  PPS  was  used  for  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  variables  and 
consisted  of  all  patients  in  the  FAS  who  did  not  have  any  major  protocol  deviations  that  could  have 
confounded the interpretation of efficacy analyses. Overall, 85 randomised patients were excluded from 
the PPS: 62 in the siponimod group and 23 in the placebo group; while an additional 179 patients had 
data excluded from PP analyses from the date of the deviation onwards. In addition, any efficacy data 
assessed after permanent study drug discontinuation were excluded.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Time to 3-month Confirmed Disability Progression  
The primary efficacy objective was to compare siponimod versus placebo in delaying the time to 3m-
CDP in patients with SPMS as measured by the EDSS. A 3m-CDP required that the EDSS score at 
progression, the 3-month confirmatory EDSS score and any EDSS scores obtained in between met the 
disability progression criteria. The confirmatory EDSS score could not have been recorded during an 
MS relapse. There was no imputation for patients who discontinued without having a confirmed 
progression. 
Siponimod showed a 21.2% risk reduction compared to placebo for time to 3m-CDP based on EDSS 
that was statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI (0.65-0.95) p=0.0134), as summarised 
below:

n/N’: n= number of subjects with events/N’=number of subjects included in the analysis (i.e. with non-missing covariates). 
# Using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment, country/region, baseline EDSS, and SPMS group (with/without 
superimposed relapses, baseline definition) as covariates. Risk reduction is derived as (1-hazard ratio) * 100. 
For 3 siponimod patients and 1 placebo patient, information on the number of relapses in the last 2 years could not be derived 
(missing). 
For the FAS, Kaplan-Meier estimates for the percentage of patients free of 3m-CDP events were 
provided at Months 12, 24, and 36. Kaplan-Meier curves showed difference between siponimod and 
placebo, in favour of siponimod. The log rank test was statistically significant, indicating a delay in the 
time to 3m-CDP in the siponimod group (p=0.0129). The percentage of patients free of 3m-CDP 
events for the siponimod arm was 81.82 %, 69.39 % and 64.17 % for the year 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. For the placebo arm, the corresponding estimates were 75.32 %, 65.03 % and 56.41 % 
for the year 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates indicated that the time to first quartile 
(25%) of patients experiencing 3m-CDP events was 541 days, 95 % CI (455; 627) and 363 days, 95

Sensitivity analyses 
The primary analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards model for time to 3m-CDP was repeated 
on the PPS and MFAS, and four sensitivity analyses of time to 3m-CDP were done for the FAS using the 
Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier estimates as detailed in the method section.

Sensitivity analysis 1: patients who discontinued the Treatment Epoch prematurely and had tentative

date of the tentative progression 
Sensitivity analysis 2: patients who discontinued the Treatment Epoch prematurely for reasons related 
to lack of efficacy or progressive disease without reaching the endpoint were categorized as having 
confirmed progression at the time they prematurely discontinued the Treatment Epoch. 
Sensitivity analysis 3: patients who discontinued the Treatment Epoch prematurely without reaching 
the endpoint were categorized as having confirmed progression at the time they discontinued the 
Treatment Epoch prematurely. 
Sensitivity analysis 4: post-baseline EDSS assessments that were documented on the EDSS cover 
page, but were not transferred in the database were considered to have met the disease progression 
criteria. 
Patients at sites where the EDSS rater had temporary access to potentially unblinding information were 
excluded from an additional analysis of time to 3-month CDP, using the primary analysis model on the 
FAS. Excluding data from the 213 patients potentially unblinded (resulting in n=1432 patients definitely 
not unblinded), the HR was 0.85 95% (0.69-1.05). Excluding data only from the 65 patients for whom 
EDSS  blinded  assessment  could  have  been  compromised  (n=1576),  the  HR  was  0.80  95%CI  (0.66-
0.97). 
Key secondary endpoints 
The two key secondary endpoints (in sequence of hierarchical testing) were: 
- 
- 
time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in T25W 
change from baseline in T2 lesion volume 
Time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in T25W 
This  first  key  secondary  endpoint  in  the  hierarchy  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  (p=0.4398) 
achieving only a 6.2% risk reduction in favour of siponimod. As specified in the methods section, the 
FAS analysis was supplemented by analyses based on the MFAS and PPS as well as by sensitivity analyses 
that did not reach statistical significance.

Change from baseline in T2 lesion volume 
Since the preceding key secondary endpoint in the hierarchy was not met, statistical significance for this 
endpoint could formally not be claimed. With this caveat, differences in the change from baseline in T2

Additional secondary endpoints 
A. Time to 6-month CDP 
Siponimod treatment delayed the time to 6m-CDP compared to placebo. A risk reduction of 25.9% in 
6m-CDP  was  observed  for  siponimod  (218/1096  events)  compared  to  placebo  (139/545  events)  (HR 
0.74,  95%CI  (0.60,  0.92)  p=0.0058).The  percentage  of  patients  free  of  6m-CDP  events  for  the 
siponimod arm was 86.51%, 76.41% and 75.27% for the year 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For the placebo 
arm,  the  corresponding  estimates  were  78.30%,  71.48%  and  70.07%  for  the  year  1,  2  and  3, 
respectively. Analyses of time to 6m-CDP were repeated on the PPS showing a 29.4% risk reduction in 
6-month  disability  progression  for  siponimod  compared  to  placebo  (HR  0.71,  95%CI  (0.56-0.88), 
p=0.0021). Time to 6m-CDP sustained until last observation in core part was also analysed using the 
Cox proportional hazards model. This supportive analysis showed a risk reduction of 22.0% for siponimod 
relative to placebo (p=0.0349). Finally, when excluding data from the 213 potentially unblinded patients, 
the HR was 0.77 with a 95% CI of (0.61-0.97) in the remaining (n=1432) patients that could not have 
been unblinded. 
B. Relapse Related-Variables 
Annualised relapse rate (ARR) 
Analyses of relapse were done for confirmed relapses and all relapses (confirmed and unconfirmed). The 
adjusted group-based (aggregate) ARRs showed low incidence of relapses in the study population (Table 
19). Analysis of adjusted ARR using negative binomial model for confirmed relapses showed a 55.5% 
rate reduction for confirmed relapses for siponimod compared to placebo (ARR ratio 0.445, p<0.0001). 
Excluding data from the 213 patients potentially unblinded (resulting in n=1432 patients definitely not 
unblinded),  analysis  of  adjusted  ARR  using negative  binomial  model  for  confirmed  relapses  showed  a 
58.1%  rate  reduction  for  confirmed  relapses  for  siponimod  compared  to  placebo  (ARR  ratio  0.419, 
p<0.0001).

Time to first relapse 
The analysis of time to first confirmed relapse showed a risk reduction of 46.4% that favoured siponimod 
(113/1061 events) compared to placebo (100/528) (HR 0.54, 95%CI (0.41, 0.70) p<0.0001). The risk 
reduction  of  48.3%  observed  for  the  PPS  (hazard  ratio:  0.52;  95%CI  (0.39-0.69)  p<0.0001)  was 
consistent  with  the  results  observed  for  the  FAS.  Kaplan-Meier  curves  depicting  the  percentage  of 
patients who were free of confirmed relapse showed a difference between siponimod and placebo in the 
percentage of patients free of confirmed relapse (Figure 16).

Proportion of patients with relapse 
Relapses were observed in a lower percentage of patients treated with siponimod (184/1029=16.7%) 
compared  to  placebo  (142/546=26.0%).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  confirmed  relapses 
(113/1099=10.3%  for  Siponimod  arm  and  102/546=18.7%  for  placebo)  is  difficult  to  interpret  in  an 
event-driven study design with highly variable study duration across patients.  
C. Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) 
Walking ability (ambulation) was self - assessed by the patients using the MSWS-12. Total transformed 
scores on the MSWS-12 ranged from 0-100 with higher scores reflecting greater impairment. There was 
no significant difference between treatment groups.

D. MRI related variables 
T1 Gd-enhancing lesions 
At baseline, approximately 76% of patients in each group did not have T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (Table 
12). With regard to all post-baseline scans, 89.4% of siponimod patients and 66.9% of placebo patients 
were free of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (Table 21). The same trends were observed in the PPS.

The  mean  number  of  lesions  per  scan  was  low  in  each  treatment  group.  Statistically  significant 
differences,  favoring  siponimod,  were  seen  for  number  of  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  Month  12  and

The  proportions  of  patients  free  of  new  or  enlarging  T2  lesions  compared  to  the  previous  scan  were 
62.2%  and  78.8%  for  siponimod  and  46.2%  and  50.7%  for  placebo  patients  at  Months  12  and  24, 
respectively. For all post-baseline scans (performed annually), 56.9% of siponimod patients and 37.3% 
of placebo patients were free of new or enlarging T2 lesions (Table 23).Similarly, siponimod showed a 
prominent effect on the reduction of the mean number of new/newly enlarging T2 lesions at Month 12 
(relative to baseline) and Month 24 relative to Month 12 (Table 24: ).

T1 hypointense lesions 
Increase from baseline in the volume (mm3) of T1 hypointense lesions, was smaller in the siponimod 
group  at  Month  12  (541  mm3)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (635.7  mm3).  For  number  of  new  T1 
hypointense lesions (relative to previous scheduled scan), mean number of new lesions was 1.5 in the 
siponimod  group  at  Month  12  and  3.3  in  the  placebo  group,  and  showed  differences  between  groups 
(favoring siponimod) also at Months 24 (mean number of new T1 hypointense lesions 0.5 siponimod 2.4 
for placebo, compared to Month 12). 
Percent Brain Volume Change (PBVC) 
The  PBVC  relative  to  baseline  was  -0.283%  for  siponimod  and  -0.458%  for  placebo  at  Month  12 
(p<0.0001).  The  decrease  in  PBVC  was  also  lower  in  patients  treated  with  siponimod  at  Month  24 
(p=0.0196). The relative reduction by time point was 38.21% (0.175/0.458) at Month 12 and 15.26%

greater  impact  of  MS  on  day  to  day  life.  In  the  FAS  analysis,  for  physical  impact  scores,  the 
adjusted mean differences of -2.89 at Month 12 was significant (p=0.0034), favoring siponimod, 
but  significance  was  not  achieved  at  Month  24  (p=0.3000).  For  psychological  impact  scores, 
statistical  significance  was  not  achieved  at  Month  12  or  Month  24  (0.0604  and  0.6703, 
respectively). 
• 
EQ-5D: The EQ-5D included a health state classification and a VAS thermometer. For the EQ-5D 
utility scores, the small adjusted mean difference between treatment groups of 0.025 at Month 
12 showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.0392) favoring siponimod, but significance 
was not reached at Month 24 (p=0.0913). For the VAS thermometer score, statistical significance 
for  the  adjusted  mean  differences  was  not  achieved  at  Month  12  or  Month  24  (p=0.0722, 
p=0.4712, respectively). 
b)  Cognitive function  
•  Symbol  Digit  Modalities  Test  (SDMT)  oral  score:  The  score  was  based  on  number  of  correct 
answers  in  90  seconds.  At  Month  12,  the  comparison  of  adjusted  mean  change  in  correct 
responses  between  siponimod  and  placebo  showed  a  small  but  significant  difference  of  1.085 
(p=0.0132),  which  increased  to  2.303  at  Month  24  (p=0.0002)  showing  that  patients  on 
siponimod had more correct answers in 90 seconds. The difference in adjusted means over all 
time-points was 1.384 (p=0.007). There was no worsening in the siponimod group at Month 12 
and Month 24, whereas, in the placebo group a worsening of mean scores was observed at each 
time point. 
• 
Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT): The number of correct answers from the PASAT 
test  was  recorded  (possible  range  0-60).  The  adjusted  means  were  not  statistically  different 
between groups. 
•  Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMT-R): The analysis of total recall and delayed recall 
scores did not show meaningful differences between treatment groups. 
c)  Evolution  of  acute  lesions  into  chronic  black  holes:  The  average  patient-level  rates  of  T1  Gd-
enhancing  lesions  that  evolved  into  hypointense  lesions  were  similar  in  each  group  at  Month  12 
(0.63 siponimod, 0.60 placebo) and Month 24 (0.75 siponimod, 0.74 placebo). The percentages of 
patients who had at least 1 T1 Gd-enhancing lesion that evolved into a T1 hypointense lesion were 
(siponimod and placebo, respectively): 77% and 68% at Month 12 and 73% and 86% at Month 24. 
d)  MSFC: The MSFC z-scores were calculated from the subscale results (T25W, 9-HPT, and PASAT). 
The scores for these 3 components were combined to create a single score that was used to detect 
changes over time. Change from baseline in MSFC z-scores, and in the individual subscale scores 
(adjusted means) did not show significant differences between siponimod and placebo. 
e)  Disability progression based on composite endpoint: The analysis of time to 3m-CDP based on the 
composite endpoint showed a risk reduction of 9.1%; however, the difference between groups was 
not statistically significant (p=0.1775). 
Additionally, the MAH explored Low contrast visual acuity (LCVA): The analysis of change from baseline 
in  LCVA  by  visit  showed  small  differences  that  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  (p=0.3656  and 
p=0.8774 at Months 12 and 24, respectively) for comparisons of adjusted means. 
Subgroup analyses 
As an, additional secondary objective, the applicant evaluated efficacy of siponimod relative to placebo 
on  3-months  CDP  (3m-CDP)  based  on  EDSS  for  three  pre-defined  subgroup  analyses,  namely  SPMS

analyses  for  other  baseline  demographic  and  MS-related  features.  Finally,  the  applicant  presented 
subgroup analysis for SPMS group based on-trial relapses (post-baseline definition). Effect of siponimod 
was more pronounced for younger patients, moderately disabled patients, those with rapidly evolving 
MS and patients presenting makers of focal inflammatory activity (either relapses in the 2 prior years or 
Gd-enhancing T1 lesions at baseline) (Figure 17).

Change from baseline in T2 lesion volume 
Subgroup analyses for the three main subgroups specified in the SAP for the 3m-CDP based on EDSS 
were also performed for the change from baseline in T2 lesion volume. With the caveat that the 
statistical significance for the main effect for this secondary outcome could not be formally claimed as 
the preceding key secondary endpoint in the hierarchy was not met, results from subgroup analyses 
were in the same direction as the primary endpoint suggesting a larger effect on those with a rapidly 
evolving MS and/or superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to study start (Figure 18).

p<0.0001). 
Ancillary analyses  
As an attempt to disentangle the effect of Siponimod on disability progression driven by the effect on 
relapses, the applicant used different statistical methods 
1. Subgroup analyses  
As reported in the forest plots for subgroup analyses (Figure 17 and Figure 19), the HRs for 3m-CDP 
based on EDSS were 0.67 95% CI (0.49-0.91) and 0.87 95%CI (0.68-1.11) for SPMS with and without 
superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to inclusion, respectively. Similar findings were reported for 
6m-CDP  based  on  EDSS  for  SPMS  patients  with  [HR=0.63  95%  CI  (0.44-0.89)]  and  without 
superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to inclusion [HR=0.82 95%CI (0.62-1.08)].  
In addition to the baseline relapse activity, the applicant provided results based on post-baseline relapses 
over  the  trial.  The  HRs  for  3m-CDP  based  on  EDSS  were  0.80  95%  CI  (0.53-1.19)  and  0.85  95%CI 
(0.69-1.06) for SPMS with and without on-study relapses, respectively. Similar findings were reported 
for 6m-CDP based on EDSS for SPMS patients with [HR=0.86 95% CI (0.54-1.36)] and without on-trial 
relapses [HR=0.76 95%CI (0.60-0.97)].  
During the OE, the applicant provided additional estimates for 3m-CDP and 6m-CDP based on EDSS for 
different subgroups using the presence/absence of baseline Gd-enhancing lesions and relapse in the two 
years prior inclusion as criteria for subgroups definition. There were no differences between siponimod 
and placebo in CDP based on EDSS for half of the population who had neither relapse prior 2 years nor 
Gad lesion at baseline Table 26. In patients with active disease (defined as presence of relapses in the 2 
years prior to screening or presence of T1 Gad lesion at baseline dark grey in Table 26), reflecting the 
target population of the proposed indication, the hazard ratio for siponimod (BAF312) compared to placebo 
for both 3m-CDP (primary endpoint) and 6m-CDP (secondary endpoint) was significantly less than 1.00.

2. Effect independent of relapses in overall population using a re-baselined EDSS after a relapse 
The applicant evaluated the impact of lack of recovery of a relapse (confirmed and unconfirmed) on time 
to 3m-CDP based on EDSS. For this analysis, onset of progression could not occur during a relapse and, 
if the EDSS value did not return to baseline EDSS after a relapse, the increased EDSS value after relapse 
resolution was used to establish a new EDSS baseline value. Using this “re-baselining” definition of 3m-
CDP, 23.7% (261/1099) of patients in the siponimod group, and 25.5% (139/546) in the placebo group 
did show 3m-CDP. This corresponds to a non-significant relative risk of 0.93 with 95% CI (0.78; 1.12).  
3. Principal stratum analysis of effect in non-relapsing patients 
Upon request, the applicant provided additional analyses addressing two estimands using the ICH E9 
R1 addendum framework using multiple imputation based on the control arm.  
The principal stratum analysis is a theoretical way to calculate the probability of belonging to the 
“never relapsing” stratum by making several assumptions including:  
1. 
2. 
Siponimod cannot cause relapses  
The probability of belonging to a particular stratum (“never relapsing”, “only relapsing on 
placebo”, “always relapsing”, “relapsing only on siponimod”) does not depend on being a drop-
out when EDSS at baseline and previous relapses are taken into account. 
3. 
The probability of 3m-CDP is independent of being a drop-out when EDSS at baseline, previous 
relapses; treatment and stratum are taken into account. 
4. 
Patients who discontinued the treatment epoch before the time point considered (12,18 or 24 
months) were assumed to be exchangeable with non-missing patients conditional on EDSS at 
baseline (above/below 6) and prior study relapses. 
Since the calculations are iterative, a starting set of values were chosen based on available information 
(prior distribution). The starting values do influence the results, and some of those values were 
challenged in sensitivity analyses. 
The subgroup of patients that would not relapse regardless of treatment assignment (siponimod or 
placebo) can be considered as the “true non-relapsing” patients as they would not relapse under any 
treatment. In the principle stratum analysis, the relative risk for 3m-CDP was between 0.80 and 0.86 
(Table 27) however with wide confidence intervals.  
Table 27:Confirmed disability progression based on EDSS – Relative risk in non-relapsing patients - 
Principal stratum analysis 
*patients who would not relapse over the specified period of time on study regardless treatment assignment.  
In addition to the principal stratum analysis, the question of treatment effect on disability progression 
independent of an effect on relapses in the overall population was addressed using the hypothetical 
strategies described below.  Two hypothetical estimands are defined in scenarios, which reflect the 
question of interest: 
1.  under the hypothetical condition that no relapse would occur (hypothetical prescriptive), and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 88/163 
 
  
 
 
 
2.  that relapses would occur in an identical rate (same risk of experiencing intercurrent relapses) 
in both treatment groups (hypothetical natural). 
Estimation of treatment effect on disability progression before first relapse can be achieved by a Cox 
proportional hazard model applied to data with censoring at the time of first relapse. Such approach 
led to HRs of 0.87 (95%CI: 0.71; 1.08) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.61; 0.98) for 3- and 6m-CDP respectively. 
Similar HRs were obtained under the second scenario (Table 28: ).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study A2201 
This phase 2 dose-finding study (A2201, N=297) was performed in patients with RRMS investiating 5 
different  doses  of  siponimod  and  placebo  in  two  subsequent  periods.  The  patient  population  included 
was  rather  young  (mean  age  36),  with  a  preponderence  of  women,  and  a  median  disease  duration 
ranging from 4.7 to 7.6 years having rather mild functional impairment (mean baseline EDSS 1.95-2.41), 
with active disease as indicated by a median number of one relapse in the last year and two in the last 
2 years. Thus, the dose-response relationship was elucidated in a different patient population (RRMS) 
using endpoints indicative of acute focal inflammatory activity mainly with respect to MRI rather than 
clinical  endpoints.  The  statistical  approach  (MCP-mod)  used  for  assessing  the  dose  response  is 
considered  appropriate.  A  dose  titration  scheme  was  implemented  for  Period  2  (but  not  in  Period  1) 
based on safety reasons (to mitigate first-dose bradycardia) and the applicant clarified that efficacy is 
not compromised by the slight delay in reaching steady state over a 5 days titration interval. The RRMS 
study  provides  information  as  to  which  doses  may  affect  the  inflammatory  component  of  MS. 
Nevertheless, effects on MRI measures in RRMS do not necessarily predict effect on disease progression 
in SPMS without focal inflammatory activity. There were 23 protocol deviations (PDev) in regard to MRI 
performance while patients were on steroid therapy or within 14 days after discontinuation of steroids. 
It was clarified that PDev of such cases were observed in all dose groups, while only one of these PDs 
indeed affected one of the scans used for the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis on the number of 
patients with PDev/scans performed during or within 14 days of steroids was reassuring that this PDev 
did not affect the overall efficacy results. For the extension study A2201E1, several limitations need to 
be considered for data interpretation, including the lack of a placebo group, the small group sizes per 
treatment arm, and the variable treatment interruption between the core and the extension part. This 
was due to a delay in approval of a protocol amendment aiming to incorporate the dose titration regimen 
and hence concerned patients included in Period 1 of the core part (i.e. those assigned to 10 mg, 2 mg, 
and 0.5 mg siponimod). Patients from Period 1 had dose interruptions of up to 10 months, which was 
clarified to have had an impact on inflammatory activity. However, an effect could be regained after re-
initiation of treatment. 
Study A2304 
Only one pivotal study (A2304) testing one dose level of siponimod (2 mg) was performed in SPMS. 
However, the study was large (N=1651). 
Eligibility criteria and study population: patients were recruited in 31 countries across 5 continents. 78% 
of patients were recruited in the EU, and the study results are thus considered relevant for the European 
population.  Regarding  eligibility  criteria,  653  out  of  1651  patients  (39  %)  were  included  based  on  a 
written  statement  of  the  clinical  evidence  of  disability  progression  in  the  previous  2  years  and 
retrospective assessment of EDSS scores from data up to 2 years prior to screening (inclusion criterion 
No.6).  Approximately  one  third  of  these  patients  (n=170)  were  lacking  adjudications  at  the  time  of 
randomisation.  94  of  these  170  patients  were  identified  during the enrolment period  and  reported  as 
PDev in the clinical study report. Additional 76 patients were identified just prior to database lock and 
confirmed to be eligible in retrospect but not handled as PDev. According to the applicant, patients with 
late adjudications were not treated differently in the FAS analyses. In addition, 13 patients were identified 
to have been randomised without any documented evidence of disability progression in the 2 years prior 
to  enrolment  available  (neither  through  EDSS  scores  in  the  medical  history  nor  through  central 
adjudication). Although the late adjudication for these 170 patients and the lack of adjudication for these 
13 patients (7 from the active treatment arm and 5 from the placebo arm) are concerns with regard to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 94/163 
 
  
 
the reliability of the study conduct, the CHMP agreed that it does not influence study results as evidence 
of progression in the 2 years prior study entry was retrospectively confirmed and a sensitivity analysis 
of the primary endpoint excluding the 13 patients with lack of adjudication was in line with the primary 
analysis. 
According to the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple 
Sclerosis  (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011,  Rev.2),  for  demonstration  of  prevention  of  disability  progression 
independent  of  relapses  in  SPMS,  it  is  recommended  to  target  only  SPMS  patients  without  a  recent 
relapse and no MRI activity suggestive of active inflammation. Although 22% of the patients had not 
been  on  immunomodulatory  treatments  prior  to  the  study,  which  is  a  representative  number  for  the 
European population, several aspects of the eligibility criteria challenge the representativeness for the 
full spectrum of SPMS. In this study only patients with a relapse within 3 months prior to randomisation 
were  specifically  excluded.  Approximately  50%  of  the  patients  had  either  at  least  one  relapse  in  the 
previous 2 years of inclusion or one or more Gd-enhancing lesion at baseline. A population mainly based 
on patients with few or no recent relapses would have been preferable. Moreover, the median age of 
study population was 49 years and the median time to SPMS conversion was 2.55 years. In addition, 
even  in  the  presence  of  new  or  enlarging  T2  lesions  and  relapses,  only  30%  of  placebo  and  25%  of 
siponimod patients experienced 6m-CDP based on EDSS after 3 years in the trial which may indicate a 
relatively early phase of SPMS where biological redundancy has not yet been extenuated by extensive 
CNS damage. 
Randomization: The only parameter used as stratification factor at randomisation was 'countries'. The 
use of region (North America, Europe, Japan, rest of the world) instead of country and EDSS at baseline 
(for example above/below 6) and as stratification factors at randomisation would have been preferable. 
Moreover, since patients with recent (> 3 months) relapses were not excluded and since the number of 
previous relapses may be correlated with the probability of having relapses in the future, it would have 
been preferable to also include this factor in the stratification at randomisation.  
Blinding: Regarding blinding of treatment assignment it should be noted that not only DMC members 
and independent statisticians/programmers had access to unblinded data but also the PK analysts. Apart 
from blinding of treatment assignment, measures were taken to ensure blinding of EDSS raters to all 
other  clinical  information  (e.g.  bradycardia).  Evaluation  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  assessed  and 
managed  by  EDSS  raters  in  the  separate  NESC  database  not  accessible  by  other  study  staff. 
Furthermore,  two  separate  databases  were  set  up  for  the  main  data  and  the  dose  initiation  data  to 
preserve  the  blind.  However,  there  were  raters,  nurses,  and  investigators  with  access  to  the  first 
(titration  phase,  ECG  data)  and  main  (containing  e.g.,  AEs)  databases  with  potentially  unblinding 
information. The applicant subsequently performed the primary endpoint analysis (3m-CDP) including 
only  patients  who  could  have  been  compromised  (n=213),  which  resulted  in  a  much  larger  apparent 
effect size (HR ~ 0.4) as compared to overall HR (~ 0.8).  
The  applicant  was  asked  to  explain the difference  observed  in  HRs  between the  potentially  unblinded 
subgroup  and  the  definitely  non-unblinded  patients.  During  the  procedure,  the  applicant  identified  a 
number  of  factors  that  could  have  influenced  or  contributed  to  the  observed  imbalances  in  the  CDP 
results  including  differences  in  baseline  characteristics  (more  inflammation  and  lower  EDSS  scores  in 
this  non-randomized  subpopulation  as  compared  to  the  full  population),  a  larger  relapse  rate  in  the 
potentially unblinded subgroup compared to the overall population (considering the mechanism of action, 
this subpopulation could have experienced a greater reduction in 3m-CDP) and change in the statistical 
model dependence (‘country’ deleted as covariate). The following analyses were additionally supportive: 
The overall HR for the 6m-CDP based on EDSS, a more robust endpoint of disability progression, was 
0.74 [95%CI (0.60-0.92)] and HR after excluding 213 patients potentially unblinded was 0.77 [95% CI 
(0.61-0.97)].  Moreover,  the  applicant  identified  different  types  of  potential  unblinding  over  the  trial.

Specifically,  for  EDSS  assessment,  the  integrity  of  EDSS  data  for  65  patients  could  have  been 
compromised.  The  HR  for  the  3m-CDP  based  on  EDSS  excluding  these  65  patients  was  0.80  95%CI 
(0.66-0.97). Beyond the interpretation of the statistical significance of the observed differences in the 
change of T2 lesions volume (second key secondary endpoint), a relevant aspect in this context is that 
MRI results were analysed in a centralized reading center and therefore, the potential unblinding due to 
the “unappropriated database access” should not have affected the robustness of these results. 
Moreover,  the  applicant  presented  additional  analyses  suggesting  that  potential  unblinding  did  not 
influence  treatment  decisions  and  ratings.  Additional  analyses  based  on  heart  rate  changes on  Day 1 
(first-dose database potentially accessible for some EDSS raters) lacked a pattern on 3m-CDP or 6m-
CDP  outcomes  in  the  potentially  affected population  that  would  have indicated  intentional  unblinding. 
Moreover, the option of switching patients to open-label rescue therapy following 6m-CDP was analysed, 
which could have probably triggered the result of the potentially unblinded 213 patients. However, no 
pattern indicative of intentional unblinding of the assessment of EDSS progression for the intention to 
switch patients to active treatment was found in the potentially affected subset of patient.  
Considering  all  of  the  above,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that,  although  it  still  remained  difficult  to 
totally negate any bias due to potential unblinding, the provided arguments underline that it was unlikely 
that the subgroup results of the patients potentially affected is solely due to a systematic bias due to 
unblinding.  In  addition,  since  unblinding  of  EDSS  raters  would  provide  the  main  risk  for  bias  of  the 
primary endpoint, the analysis excluding the 65 patients whose EDSS rater could potentially have been 
unblinded was considered to cover the most relevant scenario. In this analysis, the results of the 3m-
CDP and of the 6m-CDP remained statistically significant. 
Protocol amendments: The set-up for EDSS data capture was changed during the course of the study. 
This is of concern, since the reliability of the EDSS data - and the blinding of the EDSS rater to other 
clinical  information  -  is  essential.  Algorithms  to  perform  data  control  for  inconsistencies  in  the  EDSS 
assessments were implemented at different time points during the study. According to the GCP inspection 
(Inspection Request 301), 4010 (26.4 %) EDSS examinations were corrected. In some case up to 1.5 
years had passed between the correction of the EDSS record and the actual visit.  
Primary endpoint (including statistical analysis): The primary endpoint was 3m-CDP measured by the 
EDSS  while  6m-CDP  is  the  preferred  endpoint  in  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal 
products for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev.2). It is acknowledged 
that 6m-CDP is used as a secondary endpoint (not controlled for multiplicity), however the study was 
powered  for  the  3m-CDP.  The  definition  of  onset  of  disease  progression  and  confirmation  of  disease 
progression are agreed. The Cox proportional hazard model to calculate the primary endpoint contains 
several  explanatory  variables:  treatment,  country,  baseline  EDSS  (continues  scale)  and  SPMS  group 
(with or without superimposed relapses at baseline). The only parameter used as stratification factor at 
randomisation was 'countries'. According to the Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical 
trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013), the use of additional covariates not included during the stratification 
at randomisation needs to be justified. The estimand proposed by the applicant is clinically relevant, but 
it would be difficult to justify that study discontinuations would be “missing at random” (non-informative 
censoring). Furthermore, the effect of other MS-DMT therapies including open-label siponimod can mask 
or exaggerate the treatment effect. Of note, intermediate missing EDSS values were not imputed by the 
applicant. The applicant presented sensitivity analysis considering other imputation rules and the results 
were concordant with those presented for the primary analysis.  
Effect  independent  on  relapses:  To  assess  the  treatment  effect  on  CDP  independent  on  relapses,  the 
applicant presented results using several methodological strategies including subgroup analyses, a “re-
baselining”  definition  of  3m-CDP  based  on  EDSS.  Upon  request,  the  applicant  provided  additional

analyses addressing two estimands using the ICH E9 R1 addendum framework using multiple imputation 
based on the control arm (see next section of discussion).  
First  key  secondary  endpoint:  The  applicant  used  additional  covariates  not  included  during  the 
stratification at randomisation. However, the applicant presented a justification and sensitivity analysis 
to assess the impact of the covariates on the results. The results of the sensitivity analyses are consistent 
with those of the primary analysis. 
Second key secondary endpoint: The selection of a MMRM for estimating the change from baseline in T2 
lesion volume was calculated using a mixed model for repeated measurements was endorsed. Missing 
data in the model is assumed to be at random.  
Secondary  relapse  related  endpoints:  Relapse  related  endpoints  were  not  considered  key  secondary 
endpoints and were not controlled for multiplicity. A negative binomial model was used to analyse ARR. 
Missing  data  is  considered  to  be  at  random  and  patients  who  withdrawn  early  from  the  study  only 
contribute during the observational period. The applicant presented sensitivity analysis were different 
imputation rules were implemented and the results were similar to those obtained during the primary 
analysis. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the time to first relapse.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Participant flow: treatment discontinuations and missing data 
A total of 1099 and 546 patients received siponimod and placebo, respectively, and were analysed in the 
FAS. Discontinuations from the treatment epoch/trial were 18% and 22% for siponimod and placebo, 
respectively, while discontinuations from double-blind treatment were overall higher (41% on placebo 
and 33% on siponimod). Discontinuation due to a lack of efficacy/disease progression summed up to 
12.4% of subjects on siponimod and 19.7% of subjects on placebo. Uncertainty relates to a high number 
of  subjects  in  both  groups  (10.3%  and  13%),  who  discontinued  due  to  subject/guardian  decision, 
assuming that the “decision” may also have been driven by lack of efficacy, which cannot be clarified 
with the available information.  
The applicant subsequently presented information regarding the follow-up time for different groups of 
patients:  among  those  who  completed  the  blinded  study  phase,  there  were  patients  who  did  not 
experience  a  3m-CDP  but  had  relapses  (siponimod:  51  and  placebo:  27).  Furthermore,  there  were 
patients who suffered relapses before the 3m-CDP (siponimod: 40 and placebo: 43). For the patients 
censored due to administrative censoring and who did not take any active DMT, there were some patients 
who experienced relapses (siponimod: 1 and placebo: 2). For those lost to follow-up, there were some 
who experienced relapses with or without onset of progression (siponimod: 4 and placebo: 10 in each 
group). For patients who took other DMTs after discontinuation, relapses were observed in patients who 
had administrative censoring (siponimod: 2 and placebo: 2).  
Results for the primary endpoint: In the pivotal study, 26.3% (288/1096) and 31.7% (173/545) in the 
siponimod and placebo arm experienced a 3m-CDP in EDSS. The hazard ratio (siponimod/placebo) was 
estimated  to  0.79  with  95%  CI  (0.65;0.95).  The  risk  of  3m-CDP  at  a  given  point  in  time  was 
approximately  21%  lower  for  patients  in  the  siponimod  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group,  the 
absolute difference in event rates between the siponimod and the placebo arm at the end of the study 
was  5  percentage  points,  which  may  not  be  considered  particularly  compelling  in  regard  to  a  single 
pivotal trial. The clinical relevance of the observed effect has been further explained by the applicant in 
the  course  of  this  procedure:  The  Kaplan-Meier  percentiles  show  that  the  longer-term  benefit  of 
siponimod over placebo could be equated with an improvement of about 25-30% in time to 3m-CDP and 
of more than 50% increase in time to 6m-CDP. In other words, the time to disease progression could be 
expected to be prolonged with siponimod. It needs to be noted that the majority of patients actually did 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 97/163 
 
  
not progress over the trial. The percentage of patients free of 3m-CDP events for the siponimod arm was 
81.82  %,  69.39  %  and  64.17  %  for  the  year  1,  2,  and  3,  respectively.  For  the  placebo  arm,  the 
corresponding estimates were 75.32 %, 65.03 % and 56.41 % for the year 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 
Moreover, even in the presence of on-trial new T2 lesions and relapses which could have contributed to 
increased EDSS due to an incomplete of recovery (see estimates using re-baselining definition of 3m-
CDP) only 30% of placebo and 25% siponimod patients experienced 6m-CDP for 3 years over the trial. 
This may suggest that biological redundancy is not extenuated, which usually happens in RRMS and in 
early SPMS (median time to SPMS conversion was 2.55 years).  
The results on primary endpoint in patients with active disease are:  
24.9% (128/515) and 34.6% (91/263) in the siponimod and placebo arm, respectively, experienced a 
3m-CDP in EDSS. The hazard ratio (siponimod/placebo) was estimated at 0.69 with 95% CI (0.53;0.91). 
The primary endpoint in the restricted target population was therefore met (p=0.0094). 
Key secondary endpoints: No effect of siponimod was demonstrated on the first key secondary endpoint 
‘time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in T25W’. In regard to the analysis 
of  the  first  key  secondary  endpoint,  clarification  was  provided  that  results  of  the  T25W  were  not 
compromised by allowed comedication of (dal) fampridine in 20% of subjects in either group. It could 
finally not be clarified why post-baseline results for the placebo arm were less variable compared to the 
siponimod arm. In sum, the high variability in the outcome on the T25W test in this more advanced MS 
patient  population  (more  than  50%  of  the  patients  needed  at  least  one  walking  aid)  has  limited  the 
ability to detect changes and a treatment effect.  
As for the next key secondary endpoint in the hierarchy, the change from baseline in T2 lesion volume, 
there appeared to be a treatment effect of siponimod, even if superiority could formally not be claimed. 
With this caveat, the 80% reduction in the average change from baseline T2 lesion volume over Month 
12 and Month 24 observed between siponimod and placebo groups should not be ignored not only in the 
particular context of the potential unblinding affecting primary endpoint but also in the context of the 
included SPMS population. The magnitude of the relative difference (80% reduction in T2 volume change) 
in  relation  to  the  primary  endpoint  (21%  reduction  in  the  rate  of  3m-CDP)  suggested  a  prominent 
therapeutic effect of siponimod on SPMS via the reduction of focal inflammatory activity in the CNS. 
Other secondary endpoints: a risk reduction of 25.9% in 6m-CDP was observed for siponimod compared 
to placebo (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.92, p=0.0058), a rate reduction that was roughly maintained after 
the exclusion for the 213 potentially unblinded patients. It should be noted that 15% of patients of each 
group (43/288 siponimod and 26/173) with 3m-CDP did not have another EDSS score (6-m confirmation 
score) performed. In an additional 27 siponimod and 8 placebo patients, CDP was not confirmed at 6 
months. These findings demonstrate that 3m-CDP and 6m-CDP are not necessarily interchangeable. In 
fact, the 6m-CDP endpoint is considered the more reliable endpoint with regard to the longer observation 
period  in  line  with  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of 
Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev.2). Therefore, the importance of the 6m-CDP endpoint, 
although formally a secondary endpoint in this study, should not be neglected.  
The results on 6-month CDP in patients with active disease are:  
19% (98/515) and 28.1% (74/263) in the siponimod and placebo arm, respectively, experienced a 6m-
CDP in EDSS. The hazard  ratio (siponimod/placebo) was estimated at 0.63 with 95% CI (0.47;0.86). 
The nominal p-value of this secondary endpoint is 0.0040. 
In line with the results for T2 lesion volume, a 55.5% rate reduction for confirmed relapses for siponimod 
compared  to  placebo  was  observed  in  the  trial  which  reinforces  the  effect  of  siponimod  in  SPMS  via 
reduction of focal inflammatory activity. There was no effect on self-assessed walking ability (MSWS-12) 
in line with the lack of an effect on the T25W. Analysis of composite scores based on disease-relevant

endpoints such as e.g. T25W, 9-HPT, and PASAT did not indicate an effect of siponimod. Overall, there 
were no significant differences in other exploratory results including patient-reported outcomes (quality 
of life) and other domain-specific disability scores including cognitive and visual endpoints.  
The significant difference of 2.303 letters at Month 24 (p=0.0002) for the SDMT should be interpreted 
with caution, particularly in the context of absence of correction for multiplicity in the exploratory testing 
in the trial and studies that suggest that 4 symbols or at least 10% are the minimum clinically relevant 
difference for patients with MS (the median baseline SDMT in the trial was 41).  
Effect independent of relapses: Most of the study patients (n= 785) had previously been treated with a 
MS-disease  modifying  therapy.  Patients  without  prior  treatment  seemed  to  have  had  slightly  more 
inflammation (40% had relapses in the 2 years prior screening in contrast to 34.5% of those with prior 
DMT treatment) and slightly less advanced disease (lower baseline EDSS scores).  
According to the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple 
Sclerosis  (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011,  Rev.2),  the  occurrence  of  relapse  activity  needs  to  be  assessed 
during  the  study  and  taken  into  account  when  determining  confirmed  progression  of  disability.  The 
occurrence of relapses during study A2304 needs to be interpreted cautiously given that patients had a 
variable duration on study due to the event-driven design. However, given that a number of confirmed 
and  unconfirmed  relapses  occurred  during  the  study  (n=184,  16.7 %  and  n=142,  26.0 %  in  the 
siponimod and placebo arm, respectively). However, the annualized relapse rate during study was quite 
low (0.16 in the placebo arm based on confirmed relapses).  
The applicant performed several analyses to determine the effect of siponimod independent of relapses. 
In  the  pre-planned  comparison  among  patients  with  and  without  relapses  during  the  last  two  years 
before study entry, the HR for patients without pre-study relapses was 0.87, 95 %CI (0.68; 1.11) for 
3m-CDP while the HR was 0.67 95%CI (0.49-0.91) for those with pre-study relapses. Similar findings 
were  reported  for  6m-CDP:  HR  0.63,  95%  CI  (0.44-0.89),  for  those  with  pre-study  relapses  and  HR 
0.82, 95% CI (0.62-1.08) for those without them. Given the limitation that the presence of a pre-study 
relapse  is  not  necessarily  predictive  of  presence  of  on-study  relapse  activity  (and  vice  versa),  these 
results show that the effect of siponimod on disability worsening is larger in patients with relapses. The 
effect of siponimod on CDP based on EDSS in approximately half of the population who had neither at 
least one relapse prior 2 years nor Gad lesion at baseline was small. The subgroup analysis for patients 
with rapidly evolving disease activity also showed a lower treatment effect for patients with low activity 
(HR 0.86, 95% CI (0.69; 1.09). From the subgroup analyses, the effect on T2 lesion volume appears to 
be more pronounced in patients with relapses. The applicant also performed an analysis to investigate 
the difference in time to progression for patients with and without on-study relapses. The HR for is 0.85 
(0.69;  1.06).  This  analysis  is  however  of  limited  informative  value  since  this  is  a  post  randomisation 
variable. Analyses based on post-randomisation events are confounded when both outcomes, relapses 
and confirmed disability progression, are affected by the drug treatment under evaluation. Using the “re-
baselining” definition of 3m-CDP, a non-significant relative risk of 0.93 with 95% CI (0.78; 1.12) was 
found.  
The applicant also provided a principal stratum analysis according to the ICH E9 R1 addendum framework 
using multiple imputation based on the control arm. This allows, in a theoretical way, to calculate the 
probability  of  belonging  to  the  “never  relapsing”  stratum  by  making  several  strong  assumptions 
including:  
1.  Siponimod cannot cause relapses  
2.  The  probability  of  belonging  to  a  particular  stratum  (“never  relapsing”,  “only  relapsing  on 
placebo”, “always relapsing”, “relapsing only on siponimod”) does not depend on being a drop-
out when EDSS at baseline and previous relapses are taken into account. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 99/163 
 
  
3.  The probability of 3m-CDP is independent of being a drop-out when EDSS at baseline, previous 
relapses; treatment and stratum are taken into account. 
4.  Patients who discontinued the treatment epoch before the time point considered (12,18 or 24 
months) were assumed to be exchangeable with non-missing patients conditional on EDSS at 
baseline (above/below 6) and prior study relapses. 
The  principal  stratum  analysis  indicates  that  the  risk  of  progression  could  be  about  14  -  20 %  (29  – 
33 %) lower for siponimod compared to placebo for patients who will never relapse based on the 3m-
CDP endpoint.  
The assumptions concerning missingness, are not testable since it is not possible to exclude that other 
variables  also  play  a  major  role  in  the  probability  of  DP  (for  instance  the  presence  of  Gd-enhancing 
lesions at baseline or a prominent accumulation of new or enlarging T2 lesions prior study inclusion). 
The monotonicity assumption is relaxed in the sensitivity analysis and it seems that the results do not 
vary much when this assumption is not made.  
To assess the treatment effect on CDP independent on relapses, the applicant estimated the difference 
in time to 3m-CDP by assuming that relapses would not occur. Patients who experienced a relapse were 
censored at the first relapse occurrence. Since censoring is informative (depends on treatment effect), 
IPCW is used to correct for bias. However, IPCW relys on the assumption that the probability of observing 
a relapse is completely described by the covariates (baseline characteristics) included in the model. This 
is  a  strong  assumption  since  the  variables  determining  the  probability  of  relapses  are  unknown. 
Censoring patients at the first relapse also assumes that the rate of progressive disability accumulation 
before the first relapse reflects the rate of disability accumulation over the whole course of the disease 
excluding periods affected by relapsing event. While patients who experienced relapses before inclusion 
in the study are included, it is not possible to determine whether this assumption is correct. 
The applicant also implemented a hypothetical estimand where the effect of siponimod is estimated in a 
situation where relapses had not occurred. The results of the HR varied around 0.82-0.87 for the 3m-
CDP endpoint with large CIs including 1 for the 3m-CDP endpoint and was found to be more stable for 
the  6m-CDP  endpoint  (0.77).  However,  these  analyses  are  based  on  quite  strong  and  untestable 
assumptions. In this particular context, the assumption that probability of 3m-CDP can be fully predicted 
from EDSS at baseline and previous relapses is a strong assumption to maintain.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  applicant  presented  several  analyses  in  order  to  estimate  the  effect  of 
siponimod  independent  of  relapses.  However,  it  remains  very challenging  to  disentangle  the  effect  of 
siponimod  on  relapses  and  on  general  disease  progression.  Nevertheless,  the  results  of  the  different 
analyses were consistent. 
Additional expert consultation 
At the SAG Neurology meeting held on 7 November 2019, the applicant proposed indication under 
discussion was as follows:  
“Mayzent is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(SPMS).” 
1.  Do the experts consider that the patients included in the pivotal study are 
representative of the proposed indication (Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis 
(SPMS))?  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 100/163 
 
  
 
 
 
The SAG experts considered that the patients included in the pivotal study represent only partly 
the full spectrum of patients to be included in the proposed indication – SPMS. In clinical practice, 
a significant percentage of the SPMS patients are with higher EDSS scores, are of older age and 
have longer disease duration than the ones, recruited in the presented clinical trial.  
The recruited population is representative of the “early” phase of the SPMS, and the phase when 
the transition from RRMS course happens.  
2.  Do the experts consider that the observed frequency of relapses in the placebo treated 
patients reflect what is expected for untreated patients with SPMS? 
SAG experts considered that the observed frequency of relapses in the placebo group is 
representative of an “early stage” of SPMS (and not of the “late stage” SPMS in which it is 
expected to be lower), but the SAG experts found this question difficult to answer without a clear 
knowledge if the previous DMT was effectively stopped early enough to not have an effect on the 
baseline inflammatory activity during the trial.  
Having approx. 80% of the patients on DMT before inclusion in the trial (notwithstanding the 
washout period applied) underlines the concerns, as it is practically impossible to exclude potential 
remaining effects of these therapies on the course of the observed disease progression, relapses 
and inflammatory activity. 
3.  How are patients with SPMS currently treated in clinical practice? How are SPMS 
patients experiencing focal inflammatory activity handled in clinical practice? 
There are significant regional differences, influenced by a variety of factors, including 
reimbursements and availability.  
In some countries patients below EDSS=6.5 are treated with therapies applicable for Relapsing MS 
(RMS), off-label or even with other off-label alternatives (rituximab, mitoxantrone, 
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate). In other countries, patients transitioning from RRMS to SPMS 
usually either continue ongoing DMTs or are reinstated on treatment (DMTs for RMS) if they have 
evidence for focal inflammatory activity (either a new relapse or clear MRI activity registered 
either with evidence of new T2 lesions or gadolinium-enhancing lesion). 
The SAG experts agreed that in many situations, clinicians tend to delay the diagnosis of SPMS as 
long as they consider that a risk of significant inflammatory activity remains, making patients 
eligible for therapies licensed for relapsing MS. 
The patient representatives confirmed the above situation and expressed a desire for a therapy 
that targets the described population, currently considered as transitional or “early” SPMS. They 
also highlighted that the current tendency to delay the diagnosis of SMPS makes it ever more 
difficult to gather data in the “transitioning” population.  
Is this phenotype readily identifiable by clinicians treating MS, and if so is the study 
population representative of these patients? 
The SAG experts agreed that this phenotype could be representative of an “early stage” SPMS 
cohort, which in practice will be possible to identify with close clinical monitoring and use of 
periodic standardized MRI scans. However, SAG experts insisted that the ease of diagnosis may 
vary with different settings, mainly due to difficulties, related to access to standardized high-
quality MRI. It was also highlighted that EDSS scoring may be less sensitive to some aspects of 
clinical worsening (mainly cognition) and may also vary among raters depending on their training.  
Some SAG experts expressed the opinion that it may not be that easy to precisely identify this 
population (and differentiate from RRMS patients with controlled disease), especially taking into 
account the remnant effect of DMT. 
4.  Do the experts consider that the pharmacological profile of siponimod supports a 
treatment effect on disability progression in SPMS?  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 101/163 
 
  
 
 
While the ability of siponimod to cross the blood-brain barrier could in theory support a central 
effect on the compartmentalized inflammation (associated with diffuse injury of the normal-
appearing white and grey matter) that is also present in SPMS patients (beside focal 
inflammation), the SAG experts agreed that there were no convincing experimental nor clinical 
data supporting such an effect for siponimod.  
The presented data on brain atrophy were not considered as convincing with this regard as these 
findings could be explained by the effect on the still present new focal inflammatory activity, 
rather than by an effect on the compartmentalized one or by a neuroprotective activity.  
5.  Do the experts consider that an effect of siponimod independent of relapses has been 
shown and is clinically relevant? If it is assumed that an effect on progression of 
disability cannot fully be separated from an effect on relapses, do the experts consider 
that the observed treatment effect on disability progression in the overall study 
population and the population not affected by potential unblinding, respectively, 
supports efficacy in SPMS?  
The SAG experts found it very difficult to express a position on the effects of potential unblinding 
on the observed efficacy, although a majority expressed concerns and considered that this 
situation contributes to weaken the robustness of data provided. 
The SAG experts agreed that the data provided some evidence for a positive effect of siponimod in 
“early stage” SPMS patients, but considered that this benefit was very difficult to disentangle from 
an effect on focal inflammatory activity. Thus a majority agreed that provided data were 
insufficient to support an effect independent of relapses, as well as for an effect in patients with 
higher EDSS. 
Collectively, there was a consensus among SAG experts that the data are insufficient to justify the 
use of siponimod in the whole SPMS population.  
The SAG experts discussed the need for a second confirmatory trial and they stated that should 
such a trial be considered, its focus should fall on the “later” stage of SPMS. Such additional 
evidence will be needed to justify a discussion on an approval in the “broad” SPMS indication. 
Currently, the benefit/risk ratio cannot be evaluated in the “later” SP stages, a patient population 
that may also be more sensitive to treatment side effects (older age, with more comorbidities, and 
more neurological deficits, longer disease duration). 
The SAG experts found that the available data could allow the use of siponimod in a restricted 
population of “early active SPMS stage » patients, but would not support a broader SPMS 
indication, due to an incomplete representation in the study population of the “later” SPMS stage 
population, representing a large proportion of this MS form, observed in clinical practice. 
Regarding the precise definition of the potential indication, the SAG was split. 
A majority of the experts would consider the use of siponimod in a restricted patients population 
defined on the basis of the inclusion criteria of the EXPAND trial but excluding the low EDSS scores 
(e.g. EDSS below 4) considering that diagnosis of SPMS in this disease phase is rather uncertain). 
Others would also include these patients, considering they may have a chance for experiencing 
larger benefits and lower risks. The SAG experts agreed that any definition of the potential target 
population will have to take into account the persistence of focal inflammatory activity in SPMS 
patients, but potentially also keeping in mind safety-related considerations.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A single pivotal study was performed in SPMS but included a sizeable study population. Although, the 
primary endpoint was met, there were considerable concerns regarding data quality and blinding of the 
study.  In  this  regard,  the  applicant  identified  a  number  of  factors  that  could  have  influenced  or 
contributed to the observed imbalances in the CDP results. The CHMP was of the opinion that, although,

Page 102/163 
 
  
 
it still remains difficult to totally negate any bias due to potential unblinding while agreeing that none of 
the  outlined  factors  alone  or  in  combination  could  completely  explain  this  imbalance,  the  arguments 
provided by the applicant underline that it is unlikely that the subgroup results of the patients potentially 
affected are solely caused by systematic bias due to unblinding. This was also considered in the context 
of  the  analyses  presented  for  the  6m-CDP,  a  more  robust  marker  for  CDP,  and  additional  analyses 
suggested that potential unblinding did not influence treatment decisions and ratings. In addition, the 
analysis excluding 65 patients whose EDSS raters could have potentially unblinded was considered to 
cover the most relevant scenario. In this analysis, the results of the 3m-CDP and of the 6m-CDP remained 
statistically significant. Therefore, this issue was considered solved.  
Although  the  applicant  provided  several  pre-planned  and  post-hoc  analyses,  efficacy  of  siponimod 
independent of relapses could not be convincingly shown. In fact, the effect of siponimod on disability 
progression appeared small in patients without relapses and without focal MRI activity.  
All above considered, The CHMP is of the opinion that efficacy of siponimod has been demonstrated in 
patients with SPMS with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging feature of inflammatory activity.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety database of siponimod consists of two randomized, controlled studies; a Phase 3 study 
(Study A2304) in SPMS patients with a core part and extension part and a Phase 2 study (Study A2201) 
with its long-term extension study (Study A2201E1) in patients with RRMS (see Table 30). The cut-off 
date for data collection was 31-December-2017. 
These data are supported by phase I studies in healthy and special populations. 
The study in the RRMS population (Study A2201 and the A2201E1) comprised patients with an EDSS 
score of 0 to 5.0 aged 18 to 55 years. The patients had at least one documented relapse during the year 
prior  to  study  entry  or  two  documented  relapses  during  the  two  years  prior  to  study  entry  or  a  Gd-
enhancing MRI scan at screening. 
The  study  in  the  SPMS  population  (Study  A2304)  comprised  patients  with  an EDSS  score  of  3  to  6.5 
aged 18 to 60 years. Patients in this study had documented EDSS progression in the two years prior to 
study entry of ≥1 point for patients with EDSS < 6.0 at screening, and ≥0.5 point for patients with EDSS 
≥ 6.0 at screening.

Patient exposure 
Exposure in the controlled pool 
Exposure to siponimod in the clinical program was extensive with 1784 MS patients treated with at least 
one dose of siponimod (dose ranges from 0.25 to 10 mg once daily). Of these, over 1737 MS patients 
were treated with at least one dose of siponimod 2 mg, the proposed dose for registration, or higher. 
The cumulative exposure of clinical trial MS patients to siponimod is estimated at 4650 patient-years.  
In  Study  A2304  (core  part)  a  total  of  1651  SPMS  patients  were  randomized  (1105  Siponimod, 
546 Placebo), in the extension of study A2304 1220 SPMS patients from the core part were enrolled (up 
to  31.12.2017,  study  is  ongoing).  Patients  randomized  to  siponimod  had  similar  mean  exposure  to 
double-blind study drug (18.54 months) compared to placebo (18.04 months). Acknowledging the 2:1 
randomization ratio, cumulated exposure to siponimod was 1673.8 patient-years versus 809.1 patient-
years  in  placebo.  Most  patients  in  each  group  (80.4 %  siponimod,  78.8%  placebo)  had  at  least 
12 months of exposure to double-blind study drug; however, less than 30% of patients in either group 
had at least 24 months of exposure, this was due to the event-driven study design leading to variable 
exposure  duration  for  different  patients.  Exposure  duration  in  this  study  was  variable  for  individual 
patients, ranged from less than 1 month to more than 36 months. The Extension Part of study A2304 
will allow patients to continue treatment with open label siponimod and aims to provide additional long-
term safety data as well as additional information on efficacy measures.

Each patient is counted in the category of maximum duration as well as in each lower category. The duration of 
exposure (days) to study drug is derived as (last dose date – first dose date) +1. One month is defined as 30 days. 
Patient years is (the sum of the number of days of exposure for all patients in the group)/365.25. 
Study A2201 included 297 RRMS patients (235 Siponimod, 62 Placebo) and its extension (A2201E) with 
343 RRMS patients, 184 dose blinded, 159 open label). With a median duration of exposure to siponimod 
of  63.6  months  (more  than  5  years),  study  2201  including  its  extension  contributes  mainly  to  the 
characterization  of  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  siponimod  in  RRMS  patients.  Study 
A2201 contributed exposure up to 6 months in the controlled pool, while patients in Study A2304 Core 
Part  were  exposed  for  significantly  longer  (mean  exposure  to  siponimod  and  placebo  was  18.54  and 
18.04  months,  respectively).  Mean  duration  of  exposure  to  siponimod  was  comparable  in  males  and 
females  in  the  age  groups  of  31  to  45  years,  46  to  55  years  and  >55  years  of  age.  A  summary  of

Patient-years is the sum of the exposure in days over patients / 365.25. 
In the controlled pool one month is calculated as 365.25/12 days (i.e. 30.4375 days). In the Study 2304 
analysis, one month was equal to 30 days. 
Most patients in the siponimod 2 mg and placebo groups (75.3% siponimod 2 mg, 68.9% placebo) had 
at  least  12  months  of  exposure  to  double-blind  study  drug.  Approximately  half  of  the  patients  were 
exposed for 18 months and approximately one quarter were exposed for 24 months. 
Mean  exposure  to  siponimod  2 mg  was  18.33  months  and  17.35  months  for  males  and  females, 
respectively. Mean exposure to placebo was 16.72 months and 16.38 months for males and females, 
respectively. The siponimod 2 mg group was comprised of approximately 60% female and 40% male 
patients. Mean exposure to siponimod 2 mg was comparable in males and females in the age groups of 
31 to 45 years, 46 to 55 years and > 55 years of age. 
The  mean  exposure  to  siponimod  2  mg  was  17.98  months  for  extensive  CYP2CP  metabolizers 
(WT/WT;*2/WT;*2/*2) and 16.66 months for poor siponimod metabolizers (*3/WT;*2/*3). The majority 
of patients in the siponimod 2 mg (84.3%) and (86.2%) placebo groups were extensive metabolizers. 
Patients randomized to siponimod received doses of 2 mg daily irrespective of genotype (for details see 
pharmacology section and safety in special populations). 
Exposure in the long-term safety pools 
In addition, approximately 19 months of safety and clinical efficacy data on the use of siponimod 2 mg 
in SPMS patients was provided from the ongoing Extension Part of Study A2304 (Study A2304 EP, up to 
the data cut-off of 31-Dec-2017). In this open-label extension part of the Core Part of study A2304 1220 
SPMS patients were enrolled, the study is ongoing, up to an additional 84 months (7 years). 
Long-term  safety  and  efficacy  data  in  patients  treated  with  siponimod  are  applicable  by  more  than 
5 years (811.8 patient-years) total exposure data from the Phase 2 extension Study A2201E1 in patients 
with RRMS. Data covering 2 years from the dose-blinded phase of the study (when patients were treated 
with  one  of  the  5  siponimod  doses  tested  during  Study  A2201)  and  approximately  3 additional  years 
from the open-label phase (when patients were treated with 2 mg siponimod) were provided. 
The  median  exposure  to  siponimod  was  similar  for  both  long-term  groups  and  was  approximately 
32 months at the cut-off date of 31-Dec-2017. There were 1024 (59.0%) patients exposed to siponimod 
for at least 2 years, 776 (44.7%) patients exposed for at least 3 years and 127 (7.3%) patients exposed 
for at least 5 years in the broad exposure long-term pool (Table 33:).

The number of patients exposed for more than 5 years in the Long-term pool broad (1) was larger with 
127 patients compared to 46 patients in the Long-term pool (2). The differences in the number of patients 
exposed for 2 years or longer in the in the two long-term pools are mostly accounted for by the additional 
patients from the A2201 study included in the broad (1) pool, rather than differences between pools in 
the proportions of early withdrawals. 
Mean duration of exposure to siponimod in the long-term pools was comparable in males and females in 
the age groups of 31 to 45 years, 46 to 55 years and >55 years of age. 
Mean  duration  of  exposure  in  the  siponimod  2-10  mg  (broad  (1))  group  was  32.14  months  and 
31.14 months for the extensive and poor metabolizer subgroups (CYP2C9 genotype), respectively. Mean 
duration of exposure in the siponimod 2-10 mg (2) group was 30.54 months and 29.38 months for the 
extensive and poor metabolizer subgroups, respectively. Mean duration of exposure was comparable in 
each CYP2C9 genotype subgroup.

(2) Safety data of all patients receiving at least one dose of 2 mg or 10 mg and collected while on 2 mg or 10 mg 
treatment (including dose titration period and reduced dose due to tolerability). 
Patient years is the sum of the exposure in days over all patients / 365.25. A month is 365.25/12 days. For patients 
treated in both the core and extension study/part, duration of exposure is calculated as the sum of exposure 
duration in the core and extension without counting the off-drug period in- between. 
Studies in other indications 
Three  exploratory  clinical  studies  were  conducted  in  49  patients  with  polymyositis/dermatomyositis: 
Study  CBAF312A2202  (polymyositis  or  dermatomyositis),  Study  CBAF312X2205  (polymyositis),  and 
Study CBAF312X2206 (dermatomyositis). These indications are not being pursued further. Apart from 
the  MS  indication,  there  is  one  study  ongoing;  CBAF312X2207,  which  was  initiated  and  enrolled  one 
patient before the data cut-off point (31-Dec-2017). The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of siponimod in patients with stroke due to intracerebral hemorrhage. 
No death, serious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events (AEs) were reported up to the 31-Dec-2017 
cut-off date. This study is not evaluated further here. 
All analyses were performed on the safety set (SAF) defined as: all patients who were enrolled and took 
at least one dose of study drug. 
Four pools/safety databases (S-dbs) have been created for the assessment of safety: 
1.Controlled pool (S-db1): (0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1.25mg, 2mg, 10mg, placebo) 
Patients  included  in  the  pool:  patients  in  the  placebo-controlled  double-blinded  treatment  epoch  of 
studies A2201 and A2304 from all doses.  
Records included in the pool: data collected during the double-blinded treatment period including a 30-
day follow-up period were included, but not during open-label siponimod treatment. 
Motivation for the pool: This pool is used to compare the effect of each dose of siponimod compared to 
placebo  during  controlled part  of  the  studies,  especially  the  incidence  of  the  adverse  events  listed  as 
potential risks. The pool is also used to assess the comparability of the exposure between dose groups, 
and subgroups of interests as age group, gender, race and genotype  
2.Long Term Safety Pool (S-db2) (2/10mg) 
Patients included in the pool: all patients receiving at least once siponimod 2 mg or 10 mg. 
Records included in the pool:  
a)  Data collected during the treatment period when they were treated with the target siponimod 
2 mg or 10 mg in the core (controlled and open label) and/or extension phases of studies A2201 
and A2304, including A2304 CP open-label siponimod treatment if any. 
b)  Data collected during the dose titration up to the target dose prior to period (a) above. 
c)  Data  collected  after  a  dose  reduction  from  2mg  to  1mg  (permitted  per  protocol  due  to  low 
lymphocyte counts or tolerability). Similarly, for patients who received the 10 mg dose and then 
switched  to  2mg  (and  subsequently  from  2  mg  to  1  mg  dose),  data  collected  while  receiving 
reduced dose. 
Motivation for the pool: This pool is used to assess the long-term effects of siponimod under the target 
dose of 2 mg or higher. It is also used to assess the occurrence of the potential risk appearing during 
the dose titration and re-titration. 
3. Titration pool (S-db3): Focus on the initiation and up-titration period 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 108/163 
 
  
 
The  Titration  pool  includes  patients  who  underwent  dose  titration  from  placebo  or  no-treatment  to 
siponimod 2 mg either at dose initiation in the core studies (A2201 and A2304) and/or extension study 
(A2201E1)  or  Extension  Part  of  A2304,  or  during  dose  restart  after  an  interruption  of  siponimod 
treatment of 4 consecutive days or more. Dose restarts after interruption of 4 days or more included 
restarting siponimod after stopping/completing the Core Part of A2304 and then receiving siponimod in 
the  Extension  Part  (majority  of  dose  restarts),  and  restarting  siponimod  after  interruption,  related  to 
e.g. safety event or per protocol. 
4. Long Term Safety Pool (S-db4) (2mg/10mg - broad) 
Patients included in the pool: all patients receiving at least one dose of siponimod 2 mg or 10 mg. 
Records  included  in  the  pool:  data  collected  during  the  siponimod  treatment  period  with  any  dose, 
provided the patient received at least one dose of siponimod 2mg or higher. This includes period when 
patients from study A2201 were receiving 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1.25mg or 10mg prior to switching to 2 mg. 
Controlled double-blinded, open label and extension data are included. 
Motivation for the pool: This pool is used to assess the long-term effects of siponimod for patients getting 
at least once in the target dose of 2 mg or higher. It is similar to the second long-term pool (S-db2), but 
also covers the data for these patients under different dose of siponimod before they switched. 
Total patient exposure is considered acceptable for the different siponimod dosing groups. Long-term 
safety data have been collected in accordance with requirements of ICH E1 guidance (CPMP/ICH/375/95) 
and the numbers of patients exposed for more than 6 months and more than 1 year were sufficient. 
Demographics 
The  demographics  of  the  safety  population  is  shown  below  for  patients  in  the  controlled  studies.  The 
demographics were essentially similar in the extension studies (data not shown).

Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  comprise  all  adverse  events,  which  occurred  during  the 
trials.  
There were more adverse events in the in siponimod groups than in the placebo group, and the incidence 
of adverse events increased with increasing dose of siponimod:

*Odds ratio 
TEAEs were reported for a greater percentage of patients in the siponimod 2 mg group (89.6%) than in 
the  placebo  group  (81.5%)  in  the  controlled  pool  (Table  35),  while  the  incidence  was  91.7%  in  the 
siponimod 2-10 mg broad group for the long-term safety pool. TEAEs in the siponimod 2 mg group were 
reported  most  frequently  in  the  SOC  of  infections  and  infestations  (48.6%  siponimod  2  mg,  49.6% 
placebo) followed by nervous system disorders (38.6% siponimod 2 mg, 32.1% placebo) (Table 36 : ).

A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE under each treatment is counted only once in this AE category for 
that treatment. Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency of AEs based on BAF312 2 mg. 
N is the number of patients in the treatment group at risk, n is the number of patients with at least one event in 
the treatment group.  Incidence % is calculated by n/N.

AEs of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were defined as events of potential risk of occurrence based 
on the current available preclinical and clinical data, the class effect, and the potential mechanism of 
action  of  siponimod.  The  AEs  of  interest  are  those  arising  from  known  mechanism  of  action  and 
pharmacologic  effects  of  S1P  receptor  modulators.  Based  on  prior  experience  with  the  class  of  S1P 
receptor modulators the focus is on the following AEs observed in siponimod clinical studies: infections 
(Varizella  Zoster  Virus  (VZV)  reactivation,  herpes  zoster),  lymphopenia,  macular  edema,  abnormal 
hepatic  enzymes,  malignancies  (skin  neoplasms),  hypertension,  seizures,  thromboembolic  events, 
respiratory  disorders,  peripheral  edema/  swelling  and  bradyarrhythmias  associated  with  treatment 
initiation. 
Specific safety monitoring procedures were included in the clinical trial protocols to ensure early detection 
and  provide  guidance  on  management  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  of  specific  interest:  bradyarrhythmic 
events, infections, neoplasms, eye disorders, laboratory changes and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). 
Infections 
The  most  common  infections  in  the  siponimod  2  mg  group  were  nasopharyngitis  (13.4%  vs  14.3% 
placebo), urinary tract infection (11.8% vs 13.7% placebo) and upper respiratory tract infection (8.3% 
vs 7.9% placebo). Fungal skin infections were reported in 0.9% of siponimod 2 mg patients and 0.2 % 
of placebo patients. Fungal infections were reported for a similar percentage of patients in the siponimod 
2 mg and placebo groups (3.7% and 3.1%). No imbalance in lower respiratory tract infections (4.1% vs 
4.0 %)  and  urinary  tract  infections  (14.0%  vs  16.1%)  was  observed  in  the  siponimod  2  mg  patients 
compared to placebo group (based on risk search terms defined by high level group term).  
Herpes  zoster  reactivations  occurred  more  often  in  the  siponimod  (3.0%)  than  in  the  placebo  group 
(0.7%). The SmPC adequately advices to ascertain that patients have previously been infected with or 
vaccinated against herpes zoster before initiation of treatment with siponimod.  
Serious infections: 
As is also addressed in the section of serious adverse events, cases of serious infections occurring with 
a lower frequency than tabulated above comprised: herpes zoster meningitis, encephalitis viral, sepsis, 
septic shock, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, cellulitis, and two upper respiratory tract 
infections.  Noteworthy,  there  were  no  incidences  of  PML  but  a  case  of  cryptococcal  meningitis  was 
reported.  
Lymphopenia 
Reductions  in  circulating  lymphocyte  counts  are  expected  with  siponimod  due  to  its  mode  of  action. 
Siponimod causes a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20 – 30 % of baseline 
values due to reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. Clinical pharmacology studies 
have shown that lymphocyte counts are already reduced on Day 1 of treatment. In clinical pharmacology 
studies, a sharp decrease in the lymphocyte count upon treatment initiation was observed, then values 
remained at a plateau during the chronic treatment followed by a return to baseline starting promptly 
after treatment discontinuation (Day 39).  
Lymphocytopenia  is  a  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  siponimod,  and  as  such  not  an  adverse  event. 
However, 3% of the siponimod treated patients in the controlled pool and 10% in the long-term pool 
developed severe lymphopenia, which, however, did not translate into increased infections others than 
those labelled. 
In comparison to fingolimod the half-life of siponimod is much shorter (approximately 30 h versus 200 h 
for fingolimod). Lymphocyte counts begin to recover within some days of stopping therapy, returning to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 113/163 
 
  
normal values (≥ 1.0 x109/L) within 10 days (2-4 weeks) of stopping chronic therapy in most subjects. 
Drug effects are therefore likely to cease more rapidly after discontinuation than in the case of fingolimod, 
where the return to 80% of the baseline lymphocyte counts after discontinuation of 0.5 mg fingolimod 
may take up to 48 days. 
A dose-effect of siponimod on the change from baseline in the lymphocyte count was observed at day 7, 
month 1, month 3 and month 6. Patients receiving different doses (10 mg, 2 mg, 1.25mg) experienced 
a decrease in absolute lymphocyte counts to <0.2x109/L on at least one occasion during the course of 
the study at frequencies of 36.2% (10 mg), 3.3% (2 mg), and 2.4% (1.25 mg). 
For the siponimod treated group, there was a higher proportion of patients (52.9%) with at least one 
measured  lymphocyte  count  in  the  lowest  category  (<0.4  ×  109/L)  at  any  time  on  treatment  that 
experienced one or more infections. This is compared to 45.0% of patients with infections with at least 
one lymphocyte count of 0.4 - 0.6 × 109/L and 42.3% of patients with infections with lymphocyte counts 
>0.6 × 109/L. This trend was consistent across all types of infections classified according to the organ-
related high level term. 
Lymphopenia was reported as AE in 8 patients (16.0%) in the siponimod 10 mg group, in 18 siponimod 
2 mg patients (1.6%) and no placebo patients in the controlled pool.  
For  the  long-term  pool,  absolute  lymphocyte  counts  showed  the  same  pattern  as  that  seen  in  the 
controlled pool. The counts were reduced at Day 28 for siponimod 2-10 mg and remained reduced from 
Day 28 until the end of the time period recorded. Almost all patients in the long-term pool S-db4 (broad) 
had  lymphocyte  counts  decreased  below  the  normal  range  (98.7%;  all  grades),  with  CTC  grade  4 
decreases (<0.2 x109/L lymphocytes) observed in 10.4% of patients. Generally, a higher incidence of 
lymphopenia AEs were reported in the Long-term pool S-db4 (broad) compared to the Controlled pool 
(11.6%  vs.  1.6%).  However,  it  should  be  noted  that,  for  study  blinding  purposes,  the  absolute  total 
white  blood  cell  (WBC),  neutrophil  and  lymphocyte  counts  were  blinded  from  the  sponsor  and  the 
investigator during the controlled period of the studies. Results were only communicated to the site in 
case  of  a  notable  abnormality  (for  lymphocytes  <0.2  x109/L)  that  could  have  required  a  dose 
change.However, even for patients with the lowest lymphocyte counts no substantial difference in the 
incidence  of  infections  was  detected  in  comparison  to  the  placebo  group.  More  remarkable  is  the  low 
infection  rate,  including  lower  incidence  of  infections  in  comparison  to  placebo  (49.3%),  for  those 
patients with lymphocyte counts > 0.6 × 109/L. 
In special situations of study A2304 less than the full 2 mg dose was to be administered, i.e. subjects 
with confirmed lymphocyte counts <0.2 x109/L and in patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or CYP2C9*1*3 (poor 
and intermediate metabolizer) genotype (please refer to clinical pharmacology section). 
During study A2304, patients with confirmed lymphocyte counts <0.2 x109/L at the 2 mg/day dose level 
(or placebo) underwent dose reduction to 1 mg/day during double-blind treatment and this dose was to 
be  maintained  irrespective  of  re-increase  in  lymphocyte  counts.  The  same  proceeding  was  applied  in 
patients  on  open-label  siponimod.  In  case  that  lymphocyte  counts  remained  at  0.2x109/L  or  dropped 
even further under the 1 mg dose, dose interruption became necessary and treatment was not to be re-
initiated  (using  dose  titration)  until  level  reached  0.6  x109/L.    Adequate  information  on  the  mode  of 
routine monitoring of WBC counts and lymphocyte counts in section 4.4 have been included. Please also 
refer to assessment of laboratory findings.

Macular edema: 
Macular edema is a class effect of S1P receptor modulators. The pathophysiological mechanism is based 
upon the interaction between the modulator and the S1P1 receptor present on endothelial cells. Clinical 
signs associated with macular edema can be visual acuity defect, but not systematically.  
The  applicant  reported  that  in  the  controlled  pool  of  patients  in  MS  trials,  macular  edema  (including 
cystoid macular edema) appeared as a TEAE in 20 (1.7%) patients in the siponimod 2 mg group and in 
one patient (0.2%) in the placebo treatment group. 
In the long-term safety pool (broad) five additional cases of macular oedema occurred. Of the 5 patients, 
one patient was reported with asymptomatic retinal edema (grade 1). 
Macular edema was reported as an SAE for 3 (0.3%) patients in the siponimod 2 mg group and in none 
of the patients in the other treatment groups in the controlled pool. 
In 8 siponimod patients (9 eyes), macular edema was associated with new visual impairment. Fluorescein 
angiography  was  not  routinely  performed,  but  in  patients  who  had  the  assessments  retinal  capillary 
leakage was detected in 12/38 siponimod patients (16/76 eyes) and 1/7 placebo patients (2/14 eyes). 
Recurrence of macular edema upon re-challenge with siponimod is likely. Continuation of siponimod in 
patients with macular edema has not been evaluated. It is recommended siponimod to be discontinued 
if a patient develops macular edema. Siponimod should be used with caution in patients with a history 
of  uveitis  or  diabetes  mellitus  due  to  a  potential  increase  in  the  risk  of  macular  edema.  Regular 
ophthalmological examinations should be conducted in these patients to detect macular edema. These 
instructions are addressed in the SmPC. 
Cardiac events 
Effects on heart 
Siponimod decreases the heart rate and may lead to bradyarrhythmias, especially during the initiation 
of  the  treatment.  During  dose  initiation,  7.4%  of  the  siponimod  treated  patients  experienced 
bradyarrhythmias  and  bradycardia  as  compared  to  2.9%  in  the  placebo  group.  Of  these,  18  patients 
(1.6%)  had  conduction  defects  including  first  degree  AV or  second  degree  Mobitz  type I  AV  block,  or 
ECG QT prolonged. Noteworthy, there were no second degree AV Mobitz type II or third degree AV block. 
The  bradyarrhythmic effect  is  most  pronounced 0-8 hours  post-dosing  and during the  first 7-10 days 
after treatment initiation. Patients with second degree Mobitz type II AV block, third degree AV block, 
sino-atrial  heart  block  or  sick-sinus  syndrome  should  not  use  siponimod,  if  they  do  not  wear  a 
pacemaker. Patients who in the previous 6 months had myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, 
stroke/transient ischaemic attack, decompensated heart failure (requiring inpatient treatment), or NYHA 
class III/IV  heart  failure  should  not  use  siponimod.  Finally,  the  SmPC  adequately  addresses  the 
uncertainties  of  siponimod  treatment  in  patients  taking  medications  with  strong  influence  on  cardiac 
conduction  or  function  and  recommends  that  a  cardiologist  should  be  consulted  before  initiation  of 
siponimod. A short instruction /summary to prescribing physician on treatment possibilities in case of 
severe bradycardia is also included. As it is unknown which patients who will experience a symptomatic 
reduction in heart rate, patients should not drive or operate machines during the first day of treatment 
initiation with siponimod. 
Effects on blood pressure: 
Small  increases  in  blood  pressure  are  noticeable  during  treatment  with  siponimod  both  during  the 
placebo-controlled studies and during the extensions. The increase occurred mainly during the first year 
of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 115/163 
 
  
The increase in blood pressure was reflected by more TEAEs of hypertension in the siponimod group than 
in the placebo group (12% vs 9%). However, there was a similar incidence of new systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) > 180 mmHg (0.4% vs. 0.3%) and a similar incidence of new diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 
110 mmHg (0.9% vs. 0.5%) in the siponimod and placebo groups, respectively. 
Even if blood pressure is only moderately increased, it appears to be dose and duration dependent. The 
risk needs to be taken into account for long-term treatment; this is addressed in the SmPC.  
Two patients in the siponimod group were diagnosed with ‘Retinopathy hypertensive’ as compared to 
none  in  the  placebo  group.  The  applicant  has  clarified  that  these  events  did  not  appear  related  to 
treatment with siponimod.  
Cholesterol 
Mean total cholesterol levels in the siponimod 2 mg group tended to gradually increase from baseline 
until  Month  18  when  mean  cholesterol  in  the  siponimod  2  mg  group had  increased  by  0.396  mmol/L 
compared to placebo -0.014 mmol/L. Change from baseline to last assessment on study drug was 0.350 
mmol/L for 2 mg siponimod. Mean triglyceride change from baseline in the 2 mg siponimod group also 
slightly increased from baseline until Month 9 to 0.1609 mmol/L. 
The proportion of patients with abnormally high total cholesterol was higher in 2 mg siponimod (35.6% 
All  grades)  compared  to  placebo  (23.9%).  Similarly,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  abnormally  high 
triglycerides  was  higher  in  the  2  mg  siponimod  group  (35.8%  All  grades)  compared  with  placebo 
(29.0%). There was no significant imbalance in the incidence of TEAEs relevant for the laboratory findings 
above, specifically hypercholesterolemia was reported in 2.4% of patients in the siponimod 2mg group 
compared to placebo group (2.0%); hyperlipidemia 0.4% vs. 0.2% and hypertriglyceridemia 0.2% vs. 
0.3%, respectively. The findings were comparable between the controlled and long-term pools. 
Thromboembolic events 
Results  in  the  Controlled  pool  and  in  the  Long-term  pool  do  not  indicate  that  siponimod  leads  to 
thromboembolic complications. However, as the drugs in this class lead to increased blood pressure in 
some  patients,  thromboembolic  events  may  occur  at  an  increased  frequency  after  longer-term 
treatment. Therefore, thromboembolic events are included in the RMP as an important potential risk.   
 Liver-related adverse events 
As noted with other S1P receptor modulators, increased liver transaminases (mostly ALT elevation) were 
the most commonly reported AEs of interest in patients treated with siponimod and were reported as 
TEAEs in 13. 2% of siponimod patients and 4.0% of placebo patients in the controlled. Only few patients 
showed elevations of > 5 x ULN, 1 patient had ALT>10xULN. In the controlled pool, most ALT level rises 
for the siponimod 2 mg group occurred within approximately 28 days of starting treatment. Following 
treatment discontinuation ALT returned to baseline values within 1-3 months.  
Increased  GGT  was  the  next  most  common  TEAE,  reported  for  6.0%  and  4.0%  of  patients  in  the 
siponimod 10 mg and 2 mg groups and for 1.0% of patients in the placebo group. 
No  case  of  serious  hepatotoxicity  (Hy’s  law)  or  liver  failure  was  observed  in  any  of  the  siponimod  or 
placebo groups. 
The mechanism by which siponimod may cause liver enzyme elevation is unknown. A further unexplained 
finding was a greater incidence of liver transaminase elevation in males compared to females, a gender 
Assessment report

effect  which  has  been  seen  also  with  fingolimod,  another  S1P  receptor  modulator.  However,  no 
explanation to these findings could be found.  
A  similar  total  siponimod  plasma  exposure  was  observed  in  hepatically  and  renally  impaired  patients 
compared  to  healthy  subjects,  with  a  trend  for  a  higher  unbound  siponimod  exposure  in  hepatically 
impaired patients. Initiation of treatment with siponimod in case of pre-existing hepatic abnormalities 
should be made with caution and patients should be closely monitored during treatment.  
Since siponimod is mainly eliminated via hepatic metabolism and excretion via bile into faeces, hepatic 
impairment  is  expected  to  influence  the  clearance  of  siponimod.  AST,  ALT  and  bilirubin  were  tested 
during the model development process analysing phase 1 and phase 2 studies only. Patients who develop 
symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction during treatment should have liver enzymes checked and 
siponimod should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Severe liver impairment (Child-
Pugh class C) is therefore a contraindication in the SmPC.  
Seizures 
Seizures, based on risk search terms defined by the SMQ (broad) Convulsions, were reported as TEAEs 
in 17 (1.5%) siponimod 2 mg patients and 3 (0.5%) placebo patients in the Controlled pool. 
Nine (of 17) patients had de novo events. Time to onset for the de novo events ranged from 44 to 899 
days: (< 3 months – 2 patients, 3 to 6 months – 2 patients, > 6 months – 5 patients). Of the 9 de novo 
seizure/epileptic  seizure  events,  concomitant  anti-epileptic  medication  was  administered  in  seven 
patients.  In  the  other  two  cases  (seizure  and  simple  partial  seizures)  no  anti-epileptics  were  used. 
Siponimod  therapy  was  continued  in  8 patients  and no  recurrence  of  the events  was  reported.  Study 
drug was discontinued in only one patient, with generalized tonic-clonic seizure. 
In the three placebo patients with reported seizure related event, one patient who had de novo  epilepsy 
was  started  on  anti-epileptic  medication  and  was  subsequently  seizure–free  under  antiepileptic 
medication.  In  the  other  two  cases:  final  diagnosis  was  not  confirmed  in  one  case  (reported  to  have 
“cerebral signs of possibly epileptic potentials”) and in the third case, the patient had a prior history of 
seizures. 
It has been observed that the risk of epilepsy and epileptic seizures is generally higher in patients with 
a longer MS disease duration than in the overall population. Epileptic seizures are also included as an 
ADR for various classes of MS therapies, such as interferons, fampridine and fingolimod. By now, the 
cause  of  the  apparent  increase  in  seizures  on  siponimod  appears  rather  ambiguous.  The  applicant 
confirms to monitor seizures continuously through routine pharmacovigilance and to further characterize 
the risk (frequency, nature, and severity of risk) in the post-approval setting.  
Suicidal behaviour: 
Suicidal attempt/ideation/behaviour was found to be increased in patients treated with siponimod (1.6%, 
n=18)  as  compared  to  patients  treated  with  placebo  (0.7%,  n=4)  in  the  controlled  pool.    However, 
causality  with  siponimod  treatment  could  not  have  been  established  given  that  15/18  cases  in  the 
siponimod group and 3/4  cases in the placebo group were confounded by relevant medical history of 
depression or anxiety and/or concomitant medication. 
New malignancies 
Malignancies,  based  on  risk  search  terms  defined  by  the  SMQ  Malignant  or  unspecified  tumors,  were 
reported as TEAEs in 21 (1.8%) patients [Odds ratio 0.8 vs Placebo (95% CI 0.4, 1.6)] and 1 (2.3%) 
patient [Odds ratio 1.0 vs Placebo (95% CI 0.1, 7.9)] receiving siponimod 2 mg and 0.5 mg respectively 
compared  to  14  (2.3%)  placebo  patients.  The  majority  of  reported  neoplasms  consisted  of  skin 
malignancies (based on risk search terms defined by customized NMQ) and were of comparable incidence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 117/163 
 
  
in the siponimod 2 mg (1.3%, 15 patients) and placebo (1.3%, 8 patients) groups. No increase in the 
IR (per 100 PY) of malignancy-related events was observed in the long-term safety pools [1.2 (95% CI 
0.9, 1.6)] as compared to the controlled pool [1.2 per 100 PY (95% CI 0.8, 1.9)]. 
Basal cell carcinoma was the most common neoplasm and there was no increase in IR observed in the 
long term pool (0.6 per 100 PTY (95%  CI 0.4, 0.9) as compared to controlled pool (0.7 per 100 PTY 
(95% CI 0.4, 1.2). It should be noted that active dermatological screening was continued yearly in the 
A2304 EP. 
During the core and extension studies, there were four patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 
the siponimod group as compared to none in the placebo group including a patient, who received his 
last dose of siponimod 609 days before the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The applicant has 
included ‘Malignancies’ as an important potential risk in the RMP, this is considered appropriate. More 
importantly, skin malignancies are now included as a warning in the SmPC section 4.4. 
However,  the  number  of  events  of  any  type  of  malignancy  to  date,  and  the  duration  of  follow-up,  is 
relatively limited and does not permit firm conclusions at this time on any potential long-term risk of the 
immunomodulatory  therapy.  Hence,  patients  with  known  active  malignancies  should  not  initiate 
siponimod therapy. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths:  
As of 31-Dec-2017, there were 18 patient deaths (plus one death during the screening period). Among 
the 18 deaths, 8 deaths were reported during the controlled trials; 4 placebo patients and 4 siponimod 
patients. 
The cause of death in the four patients receiving siponimod were acute myocardial insufficiency, suicide, 
urosepsis,  and  malignant  melanoma  in  patients  receiving  siponimod.  The  cause  of  death  in  the  four 
patients  receiving  placebo  were  haemorrhagic  stroke,  lung  adenocarcinoma,  unknown,  and  gastric 
cancer.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology:  
Lymphocytopenia is described in the section above. Approximately half of the patients who were 
receiving siponimod 2 mg, in the controlled pool, had WBC decreased (53.9%; all grades) compared to 
9.2% of patients in the placebo group; with no patients having grade 4 < 1.0 x109/L WBC decreased 
in any of the siponimod groups or the placebo group. 
Assessments of CBC (complete blood count) are recommended periodically during treatment, at month 3 
and at least yearly thereafter, and in case of signs of infection. Absolute lymphocyte count < 0.2x109/L, 
if confirmed, should lead to treatment interruption until recovery. In clinical studies siponimod treatment 
was interrupted in patients with absolute lymphocyte count < 0.2x109/L. The advice of clinical monitoring 
to assure that the absolute lymphocyte count is above 0.2x109/L is reflected in the SmPC. 
There were slightly more patients who had absolute neutrophil count decreased overall (4.0% all 
grades) in the siponimod 2 mg group; 2.3 % in the placebo group with no patients having grade 4 < 
0.5 x109/L neutrophils in any of the siponimod groups or the placebo group. 
Differences observed regarding ‘platelet counts decreased’ between siponimod and placebo treatment 
groups: 7.0% all grades in the siponimod 2 mg group; 5.4 % in the placebo group with a few patients 
only having platelet count decreased grade 4 < 25.0 x109/L platelets (2 patients in the siponimod 2 
mg group (0.2%) and 1 patient in the placebo group (0.2%).There were 6 patients (0.5%) who were 
reported as having had thrombocytopenia, and 3 patients (0.3%) having platelet count decreased, in 
the siponimod 2 mg treatment group (there were no patients having either event in any of the other 
treatment groups). 
Liver and renal function 
Changes of liver function parameters were also presented in the section of adverse events. There were 
no differences between patients in the siponimod and placebo groups with regard to renal parameters. 
A summary of renal events by treatment in the controlled pool showed no apparent difference between 
siponimod 2 mg and placebo treatment. 
A higher proportion of patients in the siponimod groups had treatment–emergent abnormally high liver 
enzymes (in particular ALT, AST, GGT) compared to placebo. Levels rise within approximately 28 days 
of starting treatment and remains higher compared to the placebo group during the study, which return 
to  baseline  values  within  1-3  months  after  drug  discontinuation.  Few  patients  showed  elevations  of 
> 5x ULN (grade 3) but no patient met the criteria for hepatotoxicity (Hy’s law). As there are potential 
risks associated with elevated liver enzymes the information of monitoring of liver enzymes based on 
clinical symptoms are amended to the SmPC. 
Triglycerides and cholesterol 
Changes in triglycerides and cholesterol were presented in the section of adverse events. 
Urinalysis 
No major differences between the siponimod and placebo groups or discernible trends in post-baseline 
changes in urinalysis parameters were observed in the studies.

Safety in special populations 
Age: 
The patients included in the studies were up to the age of 61 years. This is reflected in  Table 36, 
which does not include information on children, adolescents, or elderly.  
In the siponimod 2 mg group there was a higher incidence rate (IR) of serious AEs in the >45 year age 
group  than  in  the  ≤  45  year  age  group  due  to  a  higher  incidence  of  infections  and  nervous  system 
disorders in the older age group.  
Differences  of  ≥  5%  in  the  percentage  of  patients  ≤  45  years  and  >  45  years  of  age  with  AEs  were 
observed for the following PTs: Fall (8.4%, 16.3%), hypertension (7.3%, 14.1%). The observations in 
the long-term safety pools were comparable to the controlled pool. 
As the age range defined in the inclusion criteria (18 to 60 inclusive years) no data of children or elderly 
patients are available in the safety datasets. The text in the proposed SmPC informs about the lack of 
data in children and elderly (section 4.2 and 5.2).  
Race 
There was no indication that the incidence of AEs was influenced by race. However, the robustness of 
the  conclusions  on  the  influence  of  race  is  limited  as  more  than  95%  of  the  patients  treated  with 
siponimod  were  Caucasian  and  the  numbers  of  patients  in  the  Asian  and  Black/African  American 
subgroups were small. 
CYP2C9 genotypes: 
-  CYP2C9*1*1 and CYP2C9*1*2 extensive metabolizer 
-  CYP2C9*2*2 and CYP2C9*1*3 intermediate metabolizer 
-  CYP2C9*2*3 and CYP2C9*3*3 poor metabolizer 
The risk macular edema the incidence rate was higher in the poor metabolizer (*3/WT, *2/*3) 
subgroup (IR = 2.8; CI: 1.1, 5.7) than for the extensive metabolizer (WT/WT, *2/WT, *2/*2) 
subgroup (IR = 0.9; CI: 0.5, 1.5) of the siponimod 2 mg group. 
Incidence rates of selected adverse events (other than macular edema) among patients with ‘poor 
metaboliser’-genotype and ‘extensive metaboliser’-genotype are presented in Table 40: . 
Siponimod is mainly metabolised by polymorphic CYP2C9, and the genotype was found to have a 
significant impact on siponimod metabolism (see clinical pharmacology section). Therefore, all subjects 
were tested for the CYP2C9 genotype prior to study entry. Based on the expected risk of high chronic 
exposure those patients with CYP2C9*3*3 (poor metaboliser) polymorphism were not to be 
included in the study. Siponimod is therefore contraindicated (section 4.3 of the SmPC) for CYP2C9 
poor metabolizer. Respective labelling is already included in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2.  
In patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or CYP2C9*1*3 genotype it is recommended to reduce the daily dose 
to 1 mg to achieve an exposure that is comparable to that of CYP2C9*1*1 subjects receiving a 2 mg 
dose and thus avoid potential long-term safety risks of chronic higher exposure. It is further specified in 
the  SmPC  that  the  starter  pack  is  to  be  used  in  these  subjects  for  treatment  initiation.  The  starter 
package includes a daily dose of 1.25 mg at Day 5.  
Further, the applicant has been requested to present possible differences in brady-arrhythmias according 
to  genotype,  which  did  not  lead  to  further  amendments  to  the  SmPC  except  from  the  already 
implemented contraindication in poor metabolizers.

Controlled Pool (Safety Set) 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Reproductive  and  developmental  studies  in  pregnant  rats  and  rabbits  have  demonstrated  siponimod 
induced embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity in both species and teratogenicity in rats. 
As of 31-Dec-2017, a total of 15 pregnancies had been reported in 12 female patients participating in 
siponimod  clinical  trials  in  MS.  In  addition,  one  pregnancy  with  normal  outcome  was  reported  in  the 
female partner of a male patient who was randomized to placebo in A2304 Core part. Of these 12 female 
patients receiving siponimod, 7 patients had post-conception exposure to siponimod for approximately 
22-78  days.  Of  the  7  patients  with  post-conception  exposure,  3  patients  delivered  normal  babies,  3 
patients had elective abortion and one had a spontaneous abortion. 
Of the 15 pregnancies reported in 12 patients, eight resulted in successful delivery to full term with no 
maternal  complications  or  neonatal  abnormalities,  spontaneous  abortion  in  2  patients  (A2304  (n=2)) 
and elective abortion in 5 patients (randomized to 1.25mg (A2201), 1.25/2 mg, 2/2 mg (A2201E1), and 
Assessment report

Placebo  (Phase  3  DB  period)).  Of  the  above  patients  reported  with  spontaneous  abortion  (n=2)  and 
elective  abortion  (n=5),  one  of  the  patients  randomized  to  Placebo  in  the  Phase  3  DB  period  had  an 
elective abortion and later was reported with spontaneous abortion during open-label siponimod therapy 
(2 mg). 
As  siponimod  is  intended  as  a  chronic  treatment  in  SPMS  patients,  a  largely  (young  and)  female 
population, potential teratogenicity is a known risk. Siponimod is excreted into milk in the lactating rat 
(with a 2-fold lower exposure in milk compared to plasma). Measurements of siponimod in human breast 
milk have not been performed. There are no data on the effects of siponimod on the breastfed child or 
the effects of siponimod on milk production. Therefore, siponimod should not be used during pregnancy 
and lactation. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
24 hepatic impaired subjects, 8 renal impaired subjects, 49 PM/DM patients and 1948 MS patients 
have been enrolled into the siponimod clinical program. 
Hepatic impairment: Study A2122 was a single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study to assess the PK, 
safety  and  tolerability  of  0.25  mg  siponimod  in  24  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  and  16  healthy 
control subjects. Single oral doses of siponimod 0.25 mg were safe and well tolerated in subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment and matched healthy subjects. All reported AEs were 
mild in intensity; there were no SAEs. A total of three AEs of mild intensity were reported in 40 subjects 
(7.5%). No significant difference could be observed in the overall AE incidence between subjects with 
hepatic impairment (n=2, 8.3%) compared to matched healthy control subjects (n=1, 6.3%). Among 
the three AEs, only one asymptomatic AE (first degree atrioventricular block) was suspected to be related 
to  study  drug  administration  and  the  remaining  two  AEs  (pain  in  extremity  and  tonsillitis)  were 
considered to be unrelated to study drug intake. No significant bradycardia, bradyarrhythmic events or 
other cardiac rhythm abnormalities of clinical relevance were observed. 
Renal impairment: Study A2129 was a single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study to assess the PK of 
0.25 mg siponimod in 8 subjects with renal impairment and 8 subjects with normal renal function. Single 
oral doses of 0.25 mg of siponimod were safe and well tolerated. No AEs were reported. No significant 
bradycardia, bradyarrhythmic events or other cardiac rhythm abnormalities were revealed. 
Overdose 
Healthy subjects received siponimod as single doses (0.1 to 75 mg) or as multiple non-titrated doses 
(0.25  to  20  mg).  The  single  maximum  tolerated  dose  was  determined  to  be  25  mg  based  upon  the 
occurrence of symptomatic bradycardia after single doses of 75 mg. The highest investigated multiple 
dose of 20 mg over 28 days was well tolerated (9 subjects receiving 100 mg on the last day of dosing 
and 5 subjects receiving up to 200 mg daily for a duration of 3-4 days). Some of the 9 subjects had 
asymptomatic mild to moderate transient elevations of liver function tests. 
In  the  RRMS  Phase  2  Study  A2201,  one patient  (with  a  history  of  depression)  attempted  suicide  and 
overdosed on 41 siponimod 2 mg tablets. Aside from a slight elevation in liver transaminases, the patient 
did not experience any other AEs from the overdose. 
Drug abuse 
Overall,  chemistry,  nonclinical  and  clinical  data  with  siponimod  do  not  indicate  any  signals  of  abuse, 
misuse,  or  dependence  potential  in  animals  or  humans,  nor  do  the  data  demonstrate  any  potential 
pharmacological similarities to existing drugs of abuse or psychoactive effects that may be of interest 
for  drug  abuse,  such  as  reinforcing,  mood-elevating,  sedative,  stimulant,  hallucinogenic  or  acute 
cognitive effects. These data are consistent with post-market data for the pharmacologically similar drug 
fingolimod, which has not shown any signs of abuse, misuse, diversion, or dependence in the community. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 124/163 
 
  
Therefore, it can be concluded that siponimod has no abuse or dependence potential and is not expected 
to be subject to abuse, misuse or diversion in the community, or result in harm to public health as a 
result of abuse, misuse or dependence. 
Immunological events 
Potential  effects  of  siponimod  on  the  immune  response/immunogenicity  of  selected  vaccines  were 
investigated in a dedicated study. Non inferior responder rates demonstrated that concomitant siponimod 
treatment does not compromise the efficacy of a PPV-23 vaccination (T cell-independent response) and 
therefore  no  siponimod  treatment  interruption  is  required.  The  efficacy  of  quadrivalent  influenza 
vaccination (T cell-dependent vaccine) is not compromised if siponimod treatment is paused 1 week prior 
until 4 weeks after vaccination. The applicant has included information on uncertainties regarding disease 
exacerbation in relation to siponimod and the balance between the benefit of siponimod treatment and 
the benefit of the vaccinations. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Food 
Despite a delay in Tmax, food intake has no effect on the systemic exposure of siponimod. Mean AUC and 
Cmax were similar under both fasted and fed conditions (tested at 5-mg dose). Therefore, siponimod may 
be taken without regard to meals, as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. The influence of food on the 
PK after a single dose is referenced in the SmPC Section 5.2. 
Genotype 
Under  the  proposed  genotype-based  dosing  recommendations,  a  maximum  of  a  ~  1.7-fold  increased 
siponimod  exposure  is  expected  when  siponimod  is  combined  with  a  moderate  or  strong  CYP2C9  or 
CYP3A4 inhibitor or a dual weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. When co-administered with a moderate 
CYP2C9/moderate CYP3A4 dual inhibitor (e.g. fluconazole), a higher net effect is predicted, i.e. between 
1.78-2.15-fold  for  *1*1,  *1*2,  *1*3  and  *2*3,  the  highest  effect  being  estimated  for  CYP2C9*2*2 
patients, with a net effect of 2.73-fold.  
Concomitant use of siponimod and medicinal products that cause moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or 
strong CYP3A4 inhibition is therefore not recommended. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of a 
moderate  CYP2C9/CYP3A4  dual  inhibitor  (e.g.  fluconazole)  or  a  moderate  CYP2C9  inhibitor  in 
combination with a separate moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.  Strong CYP3A4/moderate CYP2C9 
inducers  (e.g.  carbamazepine)  and  moderate  CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g.  modafinil)  are  expected  to 
significantly reduce siponimod exposure by up to 76% and up to 51% respectively. Caution should then 
be applied when siponimod is combined with strong CYP3A4/moderate CYP2C9 inducers in all patients 
regardless  of  genotype  and  with  moderate  CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g.  modafinil)  in  patients  with  a 
CYP2C9*1*3 or *2*3 genotype. 
Beta-blockers and other antiarrhythmic agents 
Beta-blockers represent a frequently prescribed drug class in the target patient population. Patients with 
MS, and in particular patients with SPMS who are more advanced in average age, have co-morbidities 
requiring  beta-blocker  therapy  (e.g.  for  hypertension  or  angina  pectoris).  The  negative  chronotropic 
effect of co-administration of siponimod and propranolol was evaluated in a dedicated PD/safety study 
designed to mimic typical clinical scenarios in which propranolol treatment would be initiated in patients 
already treated with siponimod and vice versa.  
Class Ia and II anti-arrhythmic medicinal products may result at the initiation of siponimod treatment in 
decreased heart rate and indirect prolongation of the QT interval during the titration phase. Class Ia and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 125/163 
 
  
Class III antiarrhythmic medicinal products have been associated with cases of torsades de pointes (TdP) 
in patients with bradycardia. 
In the clinical study (A2304), starting treatment with QT-prolonging or heart rate-lowering medications 
during  study  treatment  initiation  (i.e.,  the  first  10  days)  was  to  be  avoided  whenever  possible.  For 
patients receiving a stable dose of beta-blocker, resting heart rate was considered before starting study 
drug: if the resting heart rate was >50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, study drug could be 
introduced according to procedures for the Expanded Cardiac Monitoring Group (see above). If resting 
heart  rate  was  ≤50  bpm,  study  treatment  was  not  to  be  initiated.  The  investigator  was  to  carefully 
evaluate the individual risk-benefit relationship and the established guidelines depending on the type of 
beta-blocker  being  used  and  consider  potential  interruption  of  this  beta-blocker  treatment  until  the 
resting heart rate was >50 bpm. If it was decided to interrupt beta-blocker treatment the investigator 
was  to  proceed  with  caution.  Once the  resting  heart-rate  was  >50  bpm,  study  drug  could have  been 
initiated and after 2 weeks of treatment with study drug, beta-blocker treatment could have been re-
initiated.  Monitoring  was  not  only  to  be  limited  to  the  heart  rate-related  effects  but  also  to  include 
symptoms related to arrhythmia and bradycardia. Introduction of beta-blocker treatment was allowed in 
patients who were receiving a maintenance dose of study treatment (i.e., at steady state). 
If  treatment  with  siponimod  is  considered  in  patients  with  cardiac  disease,  advice  from  a  cardiologist 
should  be  sought  regarding  the  switch  to  non  heart-rate  lowering  medicinal  products  or  appropriate 
monitoring  for  treatment  initiation,  at  least  overnight  monitoring  is  recommended,  if  the  heart-rate 
lowering medication cannot be stopped. 
With  respect  to  the  reduction  of  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  by  siponimod  and  the  possible  risk  of 
bradycardia and AV block, anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive medications, live attenuated vaccines 
as well as antiarrhythmic agents or beta-blockers should only be co-administered with caution and under 
medical surveillance, which has already been adequately addressed in section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC, 
respectively.  
Oral contraceptives 
Oral  contraceptives  represent  a  frequently  prescribed  co-medication  in  female  MS  patients.  In  a 
dedicated PK and PD DDI study [Study A2121] co-administration of siponimod with a monophasic oral 
contraceptive  (combined  ethinylestradiol  and  levonorgestrel)  and  siponimod  did  not  alter  the  PK  of 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel to a clinically significant extent (no effect for ethinylestradiol; 18 % 
and  28%  increases  for  levonorgestrel  Cmax,ss  and  AUCtau,ss,  respectively).  Co-administration  with 
siponimod (4 mg qd) did not reveal clinically relevant effects on the PD of the combined ethinylestradiol 
and levonorgestrel oral contraceptive, as determined by the PD markers estradiol, FSH and LH, ovarian 
follicle sizes, Hoogland scores of ovarian activity and SHBG. These results demonstrated that the efficacy 
of the tested monophasic oral contraceptive is maintained under siponimod co-administration. 
Prohibited treatment 
During  clinical  study  (A2304)  concomitant  use  of  the  treatments  displayed  in  Table  41  below  in 
combination  with  study  drug  was  not  allowed  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  immunosuppression, 
confounding of efficacy, and/or potential interaction with siponimod. This list was modified during the 
course of the study. Use of excluded medications was not allowed after randomization while the patient 
was on study drug.

The  SOCs  with  the  highest  proportion  of  patients  discontinued  due  to  a  TEAE  in  the  siponimod  2  mg 
group were Investigations (1.6%) with ALT increased (0.5%) as the most common preferred term, Eye

dizziness (0.3%) the most common preferred term.TEAEs that led to temporary interruption of study 
drug occurred in a small percentage of patients, 6.8 % in the siponimod group and 2.8% in the placebo 
group  (controlled  pool).  The  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  interruption  were  all  in  the 
siponimod group and included macular edema, herpes zoster, ALT increased, and vomiting.

Withdrawal effects 
The incidence of AEs during the time period 1-30 days and > 30 days, after study drug discontinuation 
was  low,  did  not  show  any  consistent  pattern  that  would  be  indicative  of  withdrawal  effects.  Newly 
occurring or worsening AEs that were observed after the discontinuation of siponimod treatment were 
generally  infrequent  and  did  not  show  any  consistent  pattern  compared  to  placebo  that  would  be 
indicative of withdrawal effects. In study 2201E1 the follow-up visit was scheduled 3 months after the 
last dose of study medication for patients who prematurely withdrew from the study. 
Although  not  detected  within  the  limited  duration  of  the  follow  up  studies,  a  possible  risk  for  an 
exaggerated immune response while pausing the treatment in relation to vaccinations is addressed in 
the SmPC section 4.4. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database of siponimod consists of two randomized, controlled studies; a phase 3 study 
(Study A2304) in SPMS with a core part and extension part and a phase 2 study (Study A2201) with 
its long-term extension study (Study A2201E1) in patients with RRMS. 
The safety profile of siponimod is described with data on AEs issued from 1784 MS patients receiving 
doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg once daily. Of these over 1737 patients were treated with at least one 
dose of siponimod 2 mg, the proposed dose for registration, or higher. The safety results are consistent 
across the different studies in the siponimod MS development program. The approaches for pooling the 
safety  data  from  the  above  MS  studies  are  reasonable  and  appropriate.  The  safety  analysis  is  based 
mainly on data from the controlled pool with supportive evidence from the long-term safety pools. The 
clinical trial program had a limited follow-up time of patients 1024 (59%) patients treated for 2 years 
Assessment report

and 127 (7.3%) patients treated for more than 5 years. Therefore, experience to long-term safety risk 
is not available. 
Despite its more targeted selectivity for S1P receptor subtypes, the overall safety profile of siponimod is 
qualitatively  similar  to  fingolimod  due  to  the  same  mechanism  of  action.  However,  for  siponimod 
duration, severity, frequency and reversibility of AEs, are more rapidly reversible and transient. 
There were more adverse events in the in siponimod groups than in the placebo group, and the incidence 
of adverse events increased with increasing dose of siponimod. TEAEs reported more frequently in the 
larger  siponimod  2 mg  group  than  for  placebo  (by  ≥ 2%)  include  VZV  reactivation,  headache, 
hypertension,  nausea,  diarrhea,  liver  enzymes  elevated  (ALT  and  GGT),  bradycardia  and  peripheral 
edema.  Headache,  nasopharyngitis,  urinary  tract  infection,  and  falls  were  the  most  frequent  adverse 
events reported in more than 10 % of patients in both treatment groups. Hypertension was reported in 
121 patients (10.5%) on siponimod compared with 41 (8%) on placebo. As in the controlled pool, AEs 
in the long-term pool were most frequently infections and infestations and nervous system disorders. 
Consistent  with  the  most  common  events  seen  in  the  controlled  pool,  these  were  most  commonly 
nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, headache and fall. 
In  most  cases  differences  between  siponimod  and  placebo  were  small  and  reversible  upon 
discontinuation of treatment. Furthermore, the overall importance of the differences needs to take into 
consideration both the severity of the events and any associated sequelae. The severity of most events 
was rated as mild or moderate and the events were either transient, preventable or can be managed.  
Grade 3 TEAEs were reported for 11.0% and 9.2% of patients in the siponimod 2 mg and placebo groups, 
respectively. Grade 4 TEAEs were reported for 2.0% and 1.2% of patients in the siponimod 2 mg and 
placebo groups, respectively. Overall, the three most common TEAEs (Grade 3 or 4) in the siponimod 
group were urinary tract infection, ALT increased, and depression. 
With a median duration of exposure to siponimod of 63.6 months (≥ 5years), the extension of study 
A2201 contributes to the characterization of the long-term safety and tolerability profile of siponimod 
in RRMS patients. In the long-term pool almost all patients (94.6%) reported at least one AE, with a 
majority  (77.2 %)  of  patients  having  AEs  of  either  mild  or  moderate  severity;  57.6%  of  the  patients 
reported  AEs  suspected  to  be  study  drug  related.  Except  for  the  unspecific  or  pharmacodynamically 
expected  AEs  nasopharyngitis,  headache,  lymphopenia,  urinary  tract  infection,  back  pain,  upper 
respiratory tract infection, influenza, depression, insomnia, or diarrhoea, the incidence of any specific AE 
(in all patients) was less than 10% of the patients over the 5-year period. 
Eight percent of the included patients in the siponimod 2 mg group in the controlled pool discontinued 
the  study  due  to  an  adverse  event  as  compared  to  five  percent  in  the  placebo  group.  Reasons  for 
discontinuations  included  ‘Investigations’  with  ‘ALT  increased’  as  the  most  common  reason,  ‘Eye 
disorders’ primarily due to ‘macular oedema’, ‘Cardiac disorders’ primarily due to ‘atrioventricular block 
second degree’ and ‘bradycardia’ and ‘Nervous system disorders’ with ‘dizziness’ being the most common 
preferred 
term.  Between  11%  and  14%  of 
the  patients,  who  discontinued,  gave 
“physician/patient/guardian decision” as the primary cause.  
There were 18 patients who died in the studies or in the time after the studies. Eight deaths during the 
double-blind  period  was  divided  in  with  four  deaths  in  the  siponimod  group  and  four  deaths  in  the 
placebo  group,  hence  favoring  the  siponimod  group,  which  had  twice  the  size  of  the  placebo  group. 
However, the narratives did not indicate that the deaths were related to treatment with siponimod. 
Serious adverse events were reported for 16.8% of patients on siponimod 2 mg versus 12.2 % placebo 
patients. SAEs experienced by at least 0.5% of patients in either group were increased liver transaminase 
concentrations,  basal  cell  carcinoma,  depression,  urinary  tract  infection,  suicide  attempt,  gait 
disturbance, multiple sclerosis relapse, and paraparesis. The numbers of patients with likely treatment

related serious or other significant events appeared higher in the siponimod 10 mg, 2 mg and 0.5 mg 
groups  compared  with  the  1.25 mg,  0.25 mg  and  placebo  groups.  However,  the  shorter  treatment 
duration  for  the  siponimod  1.25 mg,  0.25 mg  and  part  of  the  placebo  group  should  be  taken  into 
consideration. Discontinuations due to adverse events followed a similar pattern. 
Safety topics of interest were associated with the biologic effect of siponimod (class effect) and are 
therefore  followed  up  closely  during  the  clinical  study  program;  infections  (including  reactivation  of 
chronic  viral  infections  other  than  VZV)  VZV  reactivation,  herpes  zoster,  thromboembolic  events, 
seizures, macular edema, dermatological alterations, bronchoconstriction, malignancies, lymphopenia, 
hepatic  disorders,  increased  rates  of  liver  enzymes,  hypertension,  and  bradyarrhythmia  including 
conduction defects during treatment initiation.  
Subjects in the siponimod group had an increased risk of special infections as compared to the subjects 
in the placebo group. There was in increased incidence of reactivations of herpes zoster, sinusitis, and 
fungal skin infections in the siponimod group. One of the cases of reactivation of herpes zoster led to 
meningitis in one patient, who recovered following a temporary interruption of siponimod. Furthermore, 
there was a case of ‘viral encephalitis’ for which the causative agent could not be clarified and one patient 
developed cryptococcal meningitis.  Taken together, the immunosuppressive effects of siponimod may 
result in more special and/or serious infections. However, the SmPC adequately advices to ascertain if 
patients  have  previously  been  infected  with  or  vaccinated  against  herpes  zoster  before  initiation  of 
treatment  with  siponimod.  The  SmPC  also  states  that  siponimod  cannot  be  initiated  in  patients  with 
ongoing severe infection. Finally, previous severe infections such as multifocal leucoencephalopathy or 
cryptococcal meningitis have been included as a contraindication.  
Before  initiating  treatment  with  siponimod,  a  recent  complete  blood  count  should  be  available. 
Assessments of CBC are also recommended periodically during treatment, at month 3 and at least yearly 
thereafter, and in case of signs of infection. The treatment with siponimod expectedly led to lymphopenia 
and,  to  a  smaller  extend,  reductions  in  leucocytes.  If  an  absolute  lymphocyte  count  < 0.2x109/L  is 
confirmed, treatment should be interrupted until recovery. This topic is addressed in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC.  
Since  a  severe  exacerbation  of  disease,  including  disease  rebound,  has  been  reported  after 
discontinuation  of  fingolimod  a  warning  on  the  risk  of  severe  exacerbation  of  disease  after  stopping 
siponimod treatment has been added in the SmpC. This risk is also highlithed with regards to the advice 
to pause siponimod treatment one week before and four weeks after vaccination. 
Malignancies were generally not detected at a higher rate in the siponimod groups as compared to the 
placebo group. Furthermore, the incidence of malignancies was not higher in the longterm safety pool 
as  compared  to  in  the  controlled  safety  pool.  Nevertheless,  since  siponimod  decreases  the  level  of 
circulating  lymphocytes,  the  immune-surveillance  may  be  compromised,  which  may  theoretically 
increase  the  risk  of  new  malignancies.  To  address  this,  the  applicant  has  agreed  to  include  new 
malignancies as an important potential risk in the RMP and a warning concerning skin malignancies in 
section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  Finally,  siponimod  treatment  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  active 
malignancies.  
Macular oedema is a well-known risk for this drug class. The risk of macular oedema is highest at the 
beginning  of  the  treatment,  although  it  also  occurs  at  later  stages  of  treatment.  An  ophthalmologic 
assessment is recommended in all patients at 3-4 months after treatment initiation. Most cases were 
non-serious  and  improved  or  resolved  spontaneously  after  stopping  siponimod  therapy.  However, 
recurrence of macular edema upon rechallenge with siponimod is likely. Patients with a history of uveitis 
or (not well controlled) diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of macular edema and require careful 
assessment before and during the initial months of therapy with siponimod; this is addressed in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. Initiation of siponimod in patients with ongoing macular edema is containdicated.  Of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 130/163 
 
  
note, peripheral edema also occurred with a higher frequency in the siponimod groups than in placebo 
groups (4.4% vs 2.3%). 
The initiation of siponimod treatment led to a mean decrease in heart rate. The decrease was mainly 
observed  during  the  first  week  of  treatment  and  most  pronounced  in  the  first  six  hours  post-dose, 
therefore a titration scheme to reach the maintenance dose on day 6 is therefore applied at the start of 
treatment (see SmPC section 4.2). The SmPC adequately contraindicates use of siponimod in patients 
who  in  the  previous  6 months  had  a  myocardial  infarction,  unstable  angina  pectoris,  stroke/transient 
ischaemic attack, decompensated heart failure (requiring inpatient treatment), or NYHA class III/IV heart 
failure, as well as patients with second degree Mobitz type II AV block, third-degree AV block, sino-atrial 
heart  block  or  sick-sinus  syndrome,  if  they  do  not  wear  a  pacemaker.  Further,  the  SmPC  adequately 
addresses the uncertainties of siponimod treatment in patients taking medications with strong influence 
on  cardiac  conduction  or  function  and  recommends  that  a  cardiologist  should  be  consulted  before 
initiation of siponimod therapy. Finally, as there are no measures to distinguish between patients, who 
will  and  will  not  experience  symptomatic  bradycardia,  patients  should  not  drive  or  operate  machines 
during the first day of treatment.  
Small  increases  in  blood  pressure  were  noticeable  during  treatment  with  siponimod.  However,  the 
increase occurred mainly during the first year of treatment and stabilised thereafter.  
The siponimod treated patients showed a decreased post-baseline lung function, as assessed by FEV1, 
FVC,  and  DLCO,  as  compared  to  the  placebo  groups.  There  is  not  an  established  mechanism  for  this 
decrease in lung function but it has been clarified that a plateau is reached following approximately one 
year of treatment. These decreases are slightly higher in patients with known pulmonary disease. 
Liver function was affected as assessed by increased levels of ALT/AST/GGT; In the controlled pool, most 
ALT  level  rises  for  the  siponimod  2 mg  group  occurred  within  approximately  28  days  of  starting 
treatment.  No  patient  met  Hy’s  law  criteria  for  hepatotoxicity  and  no  patient  developed  liver  failure. 
However, 0.5% discontinued due to affected liver function. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive 
of  hepatic  dysfunction  during  treatment  should  have  liver  enzymes  checked  regularly  and  siponimod 
should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Although there are no data to establish that patients with preexisting liver disease are at increased risk 
to develop elevated liver enzyme values when taking siponimod, patients with severe liver impairment 
(Child-Pugh  class  C)  should  not  start  treatment  with  siponimod.  The  mechanism  by  which  siponimod 
may cause liver enzyme elevation is unknown. An unexplained finding was a greater incidence of liver 
transaminase elevation in males compared to females, a gender effect which has also been seen with 
fingolimod, another S1P receptor modulator. 
Siponimod is mainly metabolised by polymorphic CYP2C9, and the genotype has a significant impact on 
siponimod metabolism. Therefore, all subjects were tested for the CYP2C9 genotype prior to study entry. 
Based on the expected risk of high chronic exposure those patients with CYP2C9*3*3 (poor metabolizer) 
polymorphism were not to be included in the study. In these affected patients the clearance of siponimod 
is  significantly  reduced  with  4-fold  increase  in  drug  exposure.  Consequently,  long-term  exposure  is 
associated  with  safety  concerns.  The  risk  is  considered  important,  as  clinical  data  related  to  chronic 
higher exposure in subjects with reduced metabolic clearance are limited as well as interactions with co-
administered  drugs  have  the  potential  to  affect  the  effectiveness  or  safety  of  siponimod  (e.g. 
coadministration of siponimod with CY2C9/CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP2C9/CYP3A4 inducers). Siponimod 
is therefore contraindicated in section 4.3 of the SmPC for CYP2C9 poor metabolizer patients.  
There was a possible imbalance between siponimod and the placebo groups with respect to seizures. To 
address this, the applicant had confirmed that seizures will be monitored continuously through routine 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 131/163 
 
  
pharmacovigilance and steps to further characterize the risk (frequency, nature, and severity of risk) in 
the post-approval setting will be taken.  
Suicidal  attempts/ideation/behavior  were  more  common  in  the  siponimod  group  (1.6%,  n=18)  as 
compared to the placebo group (0.7%, n=4). However, the applicant’s position that currently available 
data  does  not  provide  conclusive  evidence  to  establish  a  causal  role  of  siponimod  for  suicidality  was 
acknowledged.  The  applicant  will  continue  to  monitor  the  safety  topic  of  suicidality  for  changes  in 
frequency/severity of the risk by applying routine pharmacovigilance including data-mining technologies. 
As  siponimod  is  intended  as  a  chronic  treatment  in  SPMS  patients,  a  largely  (young  and)  female 
population, teratogenicity is a known risk. Due to its mode of action e.g. in vascular development, it can 
be  assumed  that  siponimod  might  cause  foetal  harm  when  used  in  pregnant  women.  Therefore,  an 
absolute contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC for the use of siponimod in pregnant women taking 
into  account  the  experience  with  fingolimod  after  marketing  authorization  as  well  as  with  siponimod 
during clinical trials is included in section 4.3. 
There  is  missing information  with  regard to  the  safety  in  elderly  patients  (over  60 years  old).  Elderly 
may be more sensitive to e.g. CNS effects of siponimod or tolerate the actual adverse reaction poorly as 
compared to younger subjects. This is clarified in the SmPC. 
The safety and efficacy of siponimod in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety database all adverse reaction reported in clinical trials have been included in the SmPC. 
The main safety issues consist of decreased heart rate and in some cases bradyarrhythmias, macular 
oedemas, and increased risk of infections including reactivation of herpes zoster. Additionally, since the 
normal surveillance system conducted by lymphocytes likely is considerably reduced, there may be a 
long-term  increased  risk  of  new  malignancies,  as  is  described  for  the  related  compound,  fingolimod. 
Appropriate measures, including additional pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation activities 
have been put in place to ensure safe and effective use of the product in the recommended indication.

SmPC section 4.2 and PL section 3 included 
recommendation on initiating the treatment 
with titration pack and on reinitiation of 
treatment if a dose is missed during the first 6 
days of treatment or when maintenance 
treatment is interrupted for 4 or more 
consecutive daily doses. 
SmPC section 4.3 contraindicates use of 
siponimod in patients  
•  who in the previous 6 months had a 
myocardial infarction, unstable angina 
pectoris, stroke/transient ischemic attack, 
decompensated heart failure (requiring 
inpatient treatment), or NYHA class III/IV 
heart failure  
•  with a history of second-degree Mobitz 
type II atrioventricular (AV) block, 
third-degree AV block, sino-atrial heart 
block or sick-sinus syndrome, if they do 
not wear a pacemaker. 
SmPC section 4.4 includes following 
recommendations:  
•  Apply an up-titration scheme to reach the 
maintenance dose on day 6 at treatment 
start. 
•  Observe patients with sinus bradycardia 
(heart rate <55 bpm), history of first- or 
second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or 
a history of myocardial infarction or heart 
failure (patients with NYHA class I and II) 
for a period of 6 hours after the first dose 
of siponimod for signs and symptoms of 
bradycardia, obtain an ECG prior to dosing 
and at the end of the observation period. 
•  Use of Siponimod is not recommended in 
patients with the following cardiac 
conditions and in patients taking certain 
antiarrhythmic, heart-rate lowering 
medications during treatment initiation. If 
treatment with Siponimod is considered in 
these patients, it is recommended to seek

• 
advice from a cardiologist for determining 
an appropriate strategy for siponimod 
treatment initiation monitoring or 
switching the treatment to a non-heart-
rate lowering treatment. 
• 
In patients with a history of 
uncontrolled hypertension or severe 
untreated sleep apnoea as significant 
bradycardia may be poorly tolerated 
in these patients. 
In patients with a history of recurrent 
syncope or symptomatic bradycardia. 
In patients with pre-existing 
significant QT prolongation or who are 
already being treated with QT-
prolonging medicinal products with 
known arrhythmogenic properties. 
In patients with Class Ia and class III 
antiarrhythmic medicinal products or 
with heart-rate-lowering calcium 
channel blockers, or other substances 
that may decrease heart rate. 
In patients with a resting heart rate ≤ 
50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker 
treatment, beta-blocker treatment 
should be interrupted before 
treatment initiation with Siponimod. If 
resting heart rate is > 50 bpm 
siponimod treatment can be initiated 
and treatment with beta blocker can 
be re-initiated after siponimod has 
been up-titrated to the target 
maintenance dose. 
SmPC Section 4.7 includes following 
recommendations for patients during 
treatment initiation 
• 
•  As dizziness may occasionally occur 
when initiation therapy with 
siponimod, patients should not drive 
or use machines during the first day 
of treatment initiation with siponimod. 
Pack size: Titration pack consists of 12 film-
coated tablets of 0.25 mg dose in a wallet. 
The titration pack allows gradual increase of 
the dose over a period of 5 days. Titration 
ends on day 6 when the maintenance dose is 
reached. Titration minimizes the risk to 
experience symptomatic bradycardia or

The SmPC section 4.4 included following 
recommendations: 
•  An ophthalmic evaluation after 3 - 4 
months of treatment initiation with 
Siponimod. 
•  Siponimod should be used with caution in 
patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, 
uveitis or underlying/co-existing retinal 
disease due to a potential increase in the 
risk of macular oedema. It is recommended 
that these patients undergo ophthalmic 
evaluation prior to the initiation and during 
the treatment with siponimod treatment. 
•  As cases of macular edema have occurred 
on longer-term treatment, patients should 
report visual disturbances at any time while 
on Siponimod treatment and an evaluation 
of the fundus, including the macula is 
recommended. 
•  Siponimod should be discontinued if a 
patient develops macular edema 
•  Siponimod therapy should not be initiated 
in patients with macular oedema until 
resolution.

recommendations: 
Before initiation of treatment with siponimod, 
patients must be genotyped for CYP2C9 to 
determine their metaboliser status. 
• 
Patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3 should 
not be treated with siponimod, use in these 
population results in substantially elevated 
siponimod level. 
•  A maintenance dose of 1 mg daily is 
recommended in patients with a 
CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotypes to avoid 
increased exposure to siponimod. 
SmPC Section 4.5 included following 
recommendations: 
Because of a significant increase in exposure 
to siponimod, concomitant use of siponimod 
and medicinal products that cause moderate 
CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibition is not recommended. This 
concomitant drug regimen can consist of a 
moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 dual inhibitor (e.g. 
fluconazole) or a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor in 
combination with a separate moderate or 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
Due to an expected reduction in siponimod 
exposure, caution should be applied when 
siponimod is combined: 
- with strong CYP3A4/moderate CYP2C9 
inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) in all patients 
regardless of genotype. 
- with moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
modafinil) in patients with a CYP2C9*1*3 or 
*2*3 genotype.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26.03.2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019

use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The  applicant  compared  the  structure  of  siponimod  with  active  substances  contained  in  authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers siponimod to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet does not yet meet the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The 
applicant will submit the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
that meets the criteria for readability.  
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Mayzent (siponimod) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MS is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory condition that causes neuro-axonal injury in the CNS 
leading  to  permanent  and  severe  neurological  impairment  and  disability.  Relapsing  multiple  sclerosis 
(RMS) describes the course of MS in patients with either RRMS or secondary progressive MS (SPMS), 
who continue to experience relapses. Patients accumulate disability as a result of incomplete recovery 
from acute relapses and/or gradual disease progression.  
More than 50% of patients with RRMS will within a median time of 15 to 20 years from onset, develop 
SPMS characterized by sustained disability with or without superimposed relapses. 
The  aim  of  the  treatment  is  to  suppress  relapses  and  disease  progression.  Therapies  for  MS  include 
treatment for relapses (e.g. corticosteroids), symptomatic treatments (e.g. fampridine) and those that 
alter the course of the disease (disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 143/163 
 
  
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
DMTs  aim  to  modify  the  course  of  the  disease  by  suppressing  or  modulating  the  immune  responses 
involved  in  MS  pathogenesis.  Currently  12  DMTs  are  available  (country/regional  differences  exist)  for 
the  treatment  of  MS  (interferon  beta-1a  and  interferon  beta-1b,  peginterferon  beta-1a,  glatiramer 
acetate,  fingolimod,  natalizumab,  teriflunomide,  dimethyl  fumarate,  alemtuzumab,  ocrelizumab, 
cladribine, and mitoxantrone). Most are approved for RRMS or relapsing forms of MS (RMS). Products 
for  both  RRMS  and  RMS  were  approved  based  on  treatment  effect  on  relapses,  MRI  lesion  activity. 
Interferon beta (IFNß)-1b is approved in the EU for patients with SPMS with active disease as evidenced 
by relapses.  
There  is  currently  no  therapy  available  that  has  been  shown  to  alter  the  progression  of  disability 
independent of relapses in patients with SPMS. The two trials in SPMS that provided efficacy data for 
marketing authorization of IFNß-1b showed a consistent 30% reduction in frequency of relapses and an 
inconsistent result for the primary endpoint “time to confirmed progression”. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program consisted of one phase 2 study in RRMS and one phase 3 study in 
SPMS: 
Study  A2201,  a  multicenter,  randomised,  parallel-group,  placebo-controlled,  adaptive  dose  ranging 
Phase 2 study in 297 RRMS patients that aimed to demonstrate dose-dependent efficacy of siponimod 
on  inflammatory  disease  activity  and  to  determine  the  optimal  dose  for  Phase  3  based  on  clinically 
relevant effects on MRI and relapses of the selected dose (2 mg once daily). 
Study A2304, a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study 
of  variable  treatment  duration  that  aimed  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  siponimod  2  mg 
once daily compared to placebo in 1651 patients with SPMS. The primary endpoint in this study was the 
3m-CDP  based  on  EDSS.  Six-month  CDP  was  included  as  a  secondary  endpoint  but  is  the  preferred 
endpoint according to the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev.2). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the single pivotal study A2304, 26.3 % (288/1096) and 31.7 % (173/545) in the siponimod and the 
placebo arm, respectively, experienced a 3m-CDP in EDSS. The HR (siponimod/placebo) was estimated 
at  0.79  with  95  %  CI  (0.65;0.95)  (p=0.0134).  The  risk  of  3m-CDP  at  a  given  time  point  was 
approximately  21%  lower  for  patients  in  the  siponimod  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  Most 
patients did not progress during the trial (percentage of patients free of 3m-CDP events: year 1: 81.82 
% and 75.32 %, year 2: 69.39 % and 65.03 % year 3: 64.17 % and 56.41 % for siponimod and placebo, 
respectively).  The  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  for  percentage  of  subjects  with  3m-CDP  showed 
separation from 6 months on with a lower proportion of patients in the siponimod group with 3m-CDP 
events throughout the treatment period.  
A hierarchical statistical testing for the key secondary endpoints was applied. No effect of siponimod was 
demonstrated on the time to 3-month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in T25W, the 
first key secondary endpoint. As for the next key secondary endpoint in the hierarchy, the change from 
baseline in T2 lesion volume, there appeared to be a convincing treatment effect of siponimod, even if 
superiority could formally not be claimed (adjusted mean over months 12 and 24 183.9 mm³ vs 879.2 
mm³; between group difference −695.3 mm³, 95% CI −877.3 to −513.3; p<0.0001).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 144/163 
 
  
The results of the analysis of the secondary endpoint “6m-CDP” were consistent with the results of the 
primary analysis. Siponimod led to a difference over placebo showing a risk reduction of 26% (HR 0.74, 
95%  CI  0.60-0.92).  The  secondary  endpoint  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR)  was  reduced  by  55.5% 
compared  to  placebo  (ARR  ratio  0.445,  95%  CI  0.337–0.587).  There  was  no  significant  difference 
between treatment groups for self-assessed walking ability using MSWS-12. Siponimod demonstrated a 
rate reduction of 86% (rate ratio 0.137, 95% CI (0.098;0.190)) in the number of Gd-enhancing lesions 
and a rate reduction of 81% (rate ratio 0.194, 95% CI (0.155;0.244)) in the number of new or enlarging 
T2 lesions over 24 months. Siponimod led to a lower rate in PBVC compared to placebo (adjusted mean 
PBVC over months 12 and 24, −0.50% vs. −0.65%; between-group difference 0.15%, 95% CI (0.07–
0.23)). All MRI endpoints were secondary endpoints and secondary endpoints other than key secondary 
endpoints were not corrected to maintain a family-wise error at 0.05 and thus the probability of a false 
positive result in at least one of these endpoints is larger than 5%. 
Analysis of exploratory composite scores based on disease-relevant endpoints such as e.g. T25W, 9-
HPT, and PASAT did not indicate a treatment effect of siponimod. Overall, there were no significant 
differences in other exploratory results including patient-reported outcomes (quality of life) and other 
domain-specific disability scores including cognitive and visual endpoints. The difference of 2.303 
letters at Month 24 (95% CI (1.105;3.501)) for the SDMT should be interpreted with caution, 
considering that this was an exploratory endpoint, therefore by study design not controlled for 
multiciplicym and studies that suggest that 4 symbols or 10% are the minimum clinically relevant 
difference for patients with MS (median baseline SDMT in the trial was 41).  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 3m-CDP indicate that the treatment effect of 
siponimod is more pronounced in the subgroup of patients experiencing relapses during the 2 years prior 
to study entry (risk reduction 33.3%, HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.49, 0.91]) as compared to patients without 
such relapses (risk reduction 12.8%, HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.68, 1.11]), in the subgroup of patients with ≥1 
Gd-enhancing  T1  lesion  at  baseline  as  compared  to  the  subgroup  without  baseline  enhancing  lesions 
(risk  reduction  36.5%,  HR  0.64  [95%  CI  0.42,  0.95]  versus  risk  reduction  17.7%,  HR  0.82  [95%  CI 
0.66, 1.02]), and in the subgroup defined as ‘rapidly evolving subjects’ as compared to those who were 
not rapidly evolving (risk reduction 34.9%, HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.46, 0.91] versus risk reduction 13.7%, 
HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.69, 1.09]). In a subgroup of patients (n=827) without signs and symptoms of disease 
activity (defined as patients without relapse in the 2 years prior to the study and without presence of 
Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  at  baseline),  the  risk  reduction  for  3m-CDP  was  7%,  HR  0.93  [95%  CI 
0.71;1.23] and for 6m-CDP it was 13%, HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.64;1.19]. 
Results for subgroup analysis on the 6m-CDP endpoint were overall consistent with those on the 3m-
CDP endpoint. 
Post-hoc exploratory principle stratum analysis assessing the treatment effect in ‘true non-relapsing 
patients’ (i.e. those who would not relapse under any treatment) in the context of the draft ICH E9(R1) 
addendum resulted in a relative risk for 3m-CDP between 0.80 and 0.86 (i.e. a risk reductions between 
14 and 20%) at time points 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months. The results were similar for the 
analysis on the 6m-CDP endpoint and similar to the results of the overall population for the primary 
endpoint 3m-CDP and secondary endpoint 6m-CDP. Using the “re-baselining” definition of 3m-CDP (if 
the EDSS value did not return to baseline EDSS after a relapse, the increased EDSS value after relapse 
resolution was used to establish a new EDSS baseline value), a non-significant relative risk of 0.93 
with 95% CI (0.78; 1.12) was found.  
Post-hoc exploratory hypothetical strategy analysis assessed the treatment effect on disability 
progression independent of an effect on relapses in the overall population (i.e. under the assumption 
that no relapse would occur and that relapses would occur in an identical rate in both treatment 
groups) in the context of the draft ICH E9(R1) addendum.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 145/163 
 
  
As  a  result,  the  point  estimates  for  the  HR  for  3m-CDP  were  at  least  0.86  (i.e.  at  least  a  14%  risk 
reduction,  95%  CI  (0.70;1.04))  and  for  6m-CDP  they  were  0.77  (i.e.  a  23%  risk  reduction,  95%  CI 
(0.62;0.96)). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Eligibility criteria and study population:  
Uncertainties were raised on the representativeness of the to-be included SPMS population, i.e. the 
number of patients that were included based on a written summary (comprising clinical evidence of 
disability progression and retrospective assessment of EDSS scores). Of note, 13 patients were 
identified to have been randomised without documented evidence of disability progression in the 2 
years prior to enrolment (neither through EDSS scores in the medical history nor through central 
adjudication). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint excluding these 13 patients (7 from the 
active treatment arm and 5 from the placebo arm) was, however, in line with the primary analysis.  
According to the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple 
Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev.2), for demonstration of prevention of disability progression 
independent of relapses in SPMS, it is recommended to target only SPMS patients without a recent 
relapse and no MRI activity suggestive of active inflammation. In this study only patients with a 
relapse within 3 months prior to randomisation were specifically excluded. In fact, close to 50% of the 
patients had either at least a relapse in the 2 years prior to study inclusion or at least a Gd-enhancing 
lesion at baseline. A population mainly based on patients with few or no recent relapses would have 
been preferable. 
Blinding: A potential unblinding issue in study A2304 was communicated by EMA after being made aware 
of  by  FDA  in  a  parallel  siponimod  submission  procedure  in  the  US.  Apart  from  blinding  of  treatment 
assignment, measures were taken to ensure blinding of EDSS raters to all other clinical information (e.g. 
ECGs taken during the titration phase). Evaluation of the primary endpoint was assessed and managed 
by  EDSS  raters  in  the  completely  separate  NESC  database  not  accessible  by  other  study  staff. 
Furthermore,  two  separate  databases  were  set  up  for  the  dose  initiation  data  and  the  main  data  to 
preserve the blind. Nevertheless, there were raters, nurses, and investigators with unintended access to 
databases with potentially unblinding information. In particular, the finding that some EDSS raters and 
also staff from the main clinical database had access to other clinical information was of considerable 
concern. The applicant subsequently performed the primary endpoint analysis (3m-CDP) including only 
patients who could have potentially been compromised by unblinding (n=213) which resulted in a larger 
apparent effect size (HR ~ 0.4) as compared to the overall HR (~ 0.8). Correspondingly, the exclusion 
of patients affected by potential unblinding changed the treatment effect from 21.2 % (N= 1,614; HR 
0.79 (0.65; 0.95)) to 15 % (N= 1,432; HR 0.85 (0.69; 1.05)).  
For those patients with active disease (N= 778), defined as having had a relapse in the 2 years prior to 
study or focal lesion on MRI at baseline, exclusion of N=120 patients potentially affected by unblinding 
from the primary analysis changed the treatment effect from 31 % (N= 778; HR= 0.69 (0.53; 0.91)) to 
19 % (N= 658; HR= 0.81 (0.59; 1.10)). 
Upon request, the applicant identified factors that could have influenced or contributed to this imbalance 
in the 3m-CDP endpoints including differences in baseline characteristics (more inflammation and lower 
EDSS  scores  in  this  subpopulation  as  compared  to  the  full  population),  a  larger  relapse  rate  in  the 
potentially unblinded subgroup compared to the overall population (considering the mechanism of action 
this subpopulation could have experienced a greater reduction in 3m-CDP) and change in the statistical 
model dependence (‘country’ deleted as covariate). Of note, the overall HR for the 6m-CDP based on 
EDSS in the overall population (HR 0.74) was less different from the HR after exclusion of potentially

Page 146/163 
 
  
unblinded population (HR 0.77). For those with active disease, analysis for the 6m-CDP resulted in a HR 
of 0.68 [95% CI 0.48, 0.96]).  
The  HR  for  the  3m-CDP  based  on  EDSS  excluding  65  patients  for  whom  specifically  EDSS  data  could 
have been compromised, considered the main source of unblinding in this study, was 0.80 (95%CI (0.66-
0.97)).  
In  analogy,  taking  into  account  the  patient  population  with  active  diease  as  outlined  in  the  proposed 
indication, excluding N=38 patients (out of n=778) for whom specifically EDSS data could have been 
compromised,  resulted  in  a  HR  of  0.72  (N=740,  95%  CI  (0.54;0.95),  risk  reduction  28%,  p-value 
0.0222) for 3m-CDP and in a HR of 0.64 (n=740, 95% CI (0.47;0.88), risk reduction 35.8%, p-value 
0.0056) for 6m-CDP.  
Beyond the interpretation of the statistical significance, there was a significant difference in the change 
of T2 lesions volume that should have not been affected by the potential unblinding as it was quantified 
in a centralized reading center. Regarding the additional analyses suggesting that potential unblinding 
did  not  influence  treatment  decisions  and  ratings,  the  MAH  provided  data  suggesting  no  association 
between EDSS outcomes and of heart rate changes and switching to open label rescue therapy. Although 
the CHMP agreed that none of them alone or in combination could completely explain this imbalance, 
the additional analyses and arguments underline that it is rather unlikely that the subgroup results of 
the patients potentially affected are solely due to a systematic bias due to unblinding. 
Dose-response  relationship:  The  dose-response  relationship  was  elucidated  in  a  different  patient 
population (RRMS) using endpoints indicative of acute focal inflammatory activity and mainly with respect 
to MRI rather than clinical endpoints. It remains thus unknown whether the 2 mg dose is the optimal 
dose for the SPMS population, although with the 10 mg dose evaluated in study A2201, the incidence of 
adverse  events  was  higher  as  compared  to  the  2 mg  dose.  Although,  the  RRMS  study  does  provide 
information  as  to  which  doses  may  affect  disease  activity  as  indicated  by  MRI  measures,  it  does  not 
necessarily predict effect on disease progression in SPMS. 
Participant flow: treatment discontinuations and missing data 
The  rate  of  treatment  discontinuations  in  the  pivotal  study  was  high,  but  not  unexpected.  It  is 
questionable if the applicant correctly describes the target of estimation as “treatment policy” strategy, 
considering  rules  for  treatment  switches  in  this  study  and  the  unclear  amount  of  data  collected  after 
treatment discontinuation. The applicant has subsequently presented information regarding the follow-
up time for different groups of patients. There were patients who did not experience a 3m-CDP but had 
relapses,  and  there  were  patients  who  suffered  from  relapses  before  the  3m-CDP.  For  those  lost  to 
follow-up, there were some who experienced relapses with or without onset of progression.  
In  a  rather  high  proportion  of  subjects,  the  main  reason  for  study  drug  discontinuation  was  “disease 
progression” and “lack of efficacy”, which summed up to 12.4% of subjects on siponimod and 19.7% of 
subjects  on  placebo.  Furthermore,  discontinuation  due  to  subject/guardian  decision  was  reported  as 
reason  in  10.3%  and  13%,  respectively.  It  could  not  be  traced  back  by  the  applicant  whether 
subject/guardian decision was also driven by reasons in line with progressing disease. However, since 
the percentage of patients was higher in the placebo group, this is not of concern. 
Primary endpoint: the relevance of the clinical treatment effect has been questioned in the course of this 
procedure:  the  risk  of  3m-CDP  at  a  given  point  in  time  was  approximately  21%  (5-35%)  lower  for 
patients in the siponimod group compared to the placebo group, and the absolute difference in event 
rates between the siponimod and the placebo arm at the end of the study  was rather modest with 5 
percentage  points.  A  clinically  relevant  treatment  effect  can  best  be  translated  into  a  prolongation  in 
time  to  disease  progression  with  siponimod  treatment:  The  Kaplan-Meier  percentiles  show  that  the 
longer-term benefit of siponimod over placebo could be equated with an improvement of about 25-30%

in time to 3- month CDP and of more than 50% increase in time to 6m-CDP. In other words, an additional 
7  or  12  months  progression  free  for  3  and  6m-CDP  respectively,  could  be  expected  over  a  2  year 
treatment period. 
According to the guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple 
Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev.2), the occurrence of relapses needs to be assessed during the 
study  and  taken  into  account  when  determining  confirmed  progression  of  disability.  The  applicant 
performed pre-planned subgroup analyses in patients with and without relapses during the last two years 
before  study  entry.  The  applicant  also  performed  analysis  to  investigate  the  difference  in  time  to 
progression  accounting  for  lack  of  recovery  of  relapses  (“re-  baselining”).  Subgroup  analyses  using 
baseline features (unconfounded) supported that the effect of siponimod on disability worsening is mainly 
driven  by  the  effect  on  focal  inflammatory  activity.  Using  the  “re-baselining”  definition  of  3-month 
confirmed  disability  progression,  a  non-significant  relative  risk  of  0.93  with  95%  CI  (0.78;  1.12)  was 
found.  In  order  to  theoretically  estimate  the  treatment  effect  for  patients  who  will  never  relapse 
regardless  of  treatment  the  applicant  presented  a  principal  stratum  analysis  and  implemented  a 
hypothetical estimand where the effect of siponimod is estimated in a situation where relapses had not 
occurred. The results of the HR and relative risk varies around 0.82-0.87 with wider CI including 1 for 
the primary endpoint 3m-CDP. All these analyses are based on quite strong and untestable assumptions 
and therefore the results should be interpreted cautiously. To summarise, the results of the analyses 
performed to estimate the effect of siponimod independent of relapses are clustered around a 0.8 – 0.9 
with  confidence  intervals  including  1,  indicating  a  numerically  small  difference  between  placebo  and 
siponimod in 3m-CDP for this group of patients.  
(Key) Secondary endpoints:  
The first key secondary endpoint ‘time to 3-months confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline 
in T25W’, which assesses walking speed, failed to show statistical significance of siponimod over placebo. 
Likewise,  the  effect  of  siponimod  on  the  MSWS-12,  a  patient-reported  outcome  measure  of  walking 
ability, did not reach nominal statistical significance. High variability was observed in patients with higher 
EDSS and in need of a walking aid which may have contributed to these results. 
While there was an overall robust effect on 6m-CDP based on EDSS (the preferred disability 
progression endpoint in the MS guideline), results on a composite endpoint for 3m-CDP (i.e., disability 
progression events based on EDSS, T25W, or 9-HPT scores, with time to progression defined as the 
time to the first of any of the 3 events), revealed a non-significant risk reduction weakening the effect 
robustness across the different disability progression endpoints in this study.  
The  treatment  effect  in  a  subgroup  analysis  of  subjects  previously  treated  with  or  without  interferon 
beta-1b  was  consistent  with  the  results  in  the  overall  population  although  it  slightly  disfavoured 
siponimod in patients with prior IFN beta-1b treatment, akin to the result of a post-hoc analysis that 
included  subjects  pre-treated  with  any  IFN  beta.  It  is  unclear  whether  this  is  a  chance  finding.  The 
subgroup analysis on patients previously treated with MS-DMTs was, however, more homogeneous. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment  with  siponimod  led  to  brady-arrhythmias,  especially  during  the  first  weeks  of  treatment 
initiation. In approximately one percent of the patients, the brady-arrythmias consisted of AV-block of 
first or second degree (only Mobitz type I) or other less specified types of escape rhythm. In a minority 
of the patients, clinical symptoms occurred in relation to the brady-arrhythmias, e.g. dizziness and chest-
pain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 148/163 
 
  
Macular oedema was observed in 1.7% of the siponimod treated patients as compared to only 0.2% in 
the  placebo  patients.  The  highest  incidence  of  macular  oedemas  was  observed  during  the  first  four 
months of treatment.  
There  was  an  increased  risk  of  infections  during  treatment  with  siponimod  consisting  mainly  of 
reactivation of herpes zoster infections, fungal skin infections, and sinusitis (sinusitis is also labelled for 
the related medicinal product, fingolimod). Further, a case of cryptococcal meningitis was confirmed. 
Transaminase elevations and increases of GGT were listed for 7-8 % of the siponimod treated patients, 
approx. 1% of the population had to discontinue treatment with siponimod due to liver-related adverse 
events.  
There  were  four  cases  of  malignant  melanoma  in  the  siponimod  group  as  compared  to  none  in  the 
placebo  group.  (An  increased  risk  of  skin  malignancies  is  labelled  for  the  related  medicinal  product, 
Fingolimod). 
There was a small but consistent increase of 2-5 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Further, 
small reductions in lung function tests are expected over time. However, the  reductions were slightly 
larger  in  the  siponimod  group  than  in  the  placebo  group,  e.g.  -100  ml  FEV1  per  3-6  months  in  the 
siponimod  as  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  In  patients  with  pre-existing  pulmonary  disease,  the 
reductions  in  lung  function  were  approx.  two-fold  the  size  of  the  reductions  in  patients  without  pre-
existing pulmonary disease.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There appears to be a risk of disease progression following discontinuation of treatment. Data are limited 
for patients discontinuing siponimod but this risk is also labelled for the related medicine, fingolimod.  
The clinical consequences of combining siponimod with other medicinal products, which influence heart 
frequency and cardiac conduction, is unknown, since such patients have been excluded from the clinical 
trials.  Similarly,  the  use  of  siponimod  in  supposedly  sensitive  patients,  e.g.  patients  with  existing 
cardiovascular disease, is unknown, since such patients have been excluded from the clinical trials. 
Elderly and patients with hepatic or renal impairment may need dose-reduction and/or have a different 
safety profile than other patient groups due to reduced clearance or increased susceptibility (elderly) to 
the adverse events. Siponimod has not been properly tested in older patients or in patients with hepatic 
or renal impairment.  
There were generally no increase in new malignancies in patients of the siponimod group compared to 
patients  in  the  placebo  group.  However,  as  the  immune  surveillance  may  be  compromised,  new 
malignancies could be a long-term risk for patients treated with siponimod.  
Suicidal  ideation/behaviour  was  somewhat  higher  in  patients  treated  with  siponimod  as  compared 
placebo (1.6 vs. 0.7%), although most cases were confounded by relevant medical history of depression 
or anxiety.

From  the  15  reported  pregnancies  in  the  siponimod  MS  clinical  program,  no  maternal  complications  or  infant 
malformations  were  observed.  Pre-clinical  reproductive  and  developmental  studies  in  the  rat  and  rabbit  showed 
siponimod induced embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity in both species and teratogenicity in rats.  
In study A2304, the first key secondary endpoint (time to 3 month confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline 
in T25W) did not reach statistical significance; additional endpoints were evaluated at nominal statistical significance 
level  of  0.05  without  correction  of  multiplicity  or  hierarchical  testing.  Nominal  p-values  for  the  other  secondary 
endpoints contribute to the understanding of the totality of the evidence of the treatment effect of siponimod in SPMS.

Siponimod  is  a  selective  modulator  of  G-protein  coupled  sphingosine-1-phosphate  (S1P1)  and  S1P5 
receptors, leading to internalization and degradation of S1P1 receptors on T and B-lymphocytes, which 
prevents their egress and recirculation from secondary lymphatic tissue to target organs including the 
CNS. 
The application is based on a single albeit large pivotal study (A2304). 78% of patients were recruited 
from  the  EU  and  thus  the  results  are  relevant  for  the  EU-population.  Close  to  50%  of  patients  did 
experience relapses in the 2 years prior to study or showed MRI activity at baseline and no patients older 
than 61 or with EDSS >6.5 were included in the study. Thus, the study population is representative of 
an “early stage” “active” SPMS population.

In patients with SPMS with inflammatory activity (n=778), defined as those with pre-study relapses or 
MRI activity at baseline, the risk reduction for the primary endpoint ‘3m-CDP’ was 31% with siponimod 
compared to placebo, in line with the 37% risk reduction in 6m-CDP, although this secondary endpoint 
was  not  corrected  for  multiplicity.  In  patients  without  pre-study  relapses  and  without  MRI  activity  at 
baseline  (N=827),  the  risk  reduction  for  3m-CDP  was  7%,  and  for  6m-CDP  it  was  13%.  Siponimod 
therefore  showed  clinically  relevant  effects  on  disease  progression  in  patients  with  “active  SPMS”, 
whereas the effect in patients with SPMS and without signs or symptoms of active disease (n=827) was 
small.  
Siponimod  treatment  was  associated  with  a  reduction  of  55%  in  ARR,  86%  in  the  number  of  Gd-
enhancing lesions and a reduction of 81% in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions over the trial in 
the overall population. These results on relapses and MRI lesions together with results from subgroup 
analyses and the mechanism of action suggested a relevant effect on focal inflammatory activity in SMPS. 
On  the  other  hand,  no  effect  of  siponimod  was  demonstrated  on  the  time  to  3-month  confirmed 
worsening  of  at  least  20%  from  baseline  in  T25W  and  self-assessed  MSW-12.  Lack  of  statistical 
significance in outcomes related with walking ability could be at least partially explained by the baseline 
disability status of the included population (median EDSS=6) and higher variability of T25W results in 
the  group  with  the  greatest  disability  status.  Similarly,  results  from  exploratory  cognitive,  visual  and 
patient-reported  outcomes  did  not  overall  demonstrate  a  difference  between  siponimod  and  placebo 
arms.  
Considering  the  study  population  included  in  study  A2304,  the  clearly  anti-inflammatory  activity  of 
siponimod  and  the  results  on  disability  progression  in  SPMS  patients  with  and  without  signs  and 
symptoms of active disease, the restriction of the indication to patients with “active SPMS” is considered 
justified. 
Unintentional  potential  unblinding  was  detected  during  a  GCP-inspection  and  considered  a  serious 
concern, esp. since the potentially unblinded subgroup of patients showed better results for the primary 
endpoint than the subgroup that could not have been unblinded. However, a bias due to unblinding was 
found rather implausible, based on the presented acceptable argumentation of the applicant and various 
(sensitivity) analyses that excluded potentially unblinded patients and supported the absence of a bias 
due to systematic unblinding. Statistical analyses with exclusion of n=213 patients from the overall study 
population (n=120 of the active subpopulation) were presented by the applicant as the most conservative 
approach of dealing with the uncertainty of potential unblinding in the trial, even though there was no 
indication  that  any  indirect  influence  of  study  staff  other  than  EDSS  raters  could  have  influenced  the 
assessment of the primary endpoint, i.e. the EDSS ratings. The additional sensitivity analyses suggest 
that  the  better  treatment  effect  in  the  potentially  unblinded  subgroup  of  n=  213  patients  (overall 
population) (in analogy with the N=120 patients excluded from the active disease population) is rather 
caused  by  a  number  of  baseline  and  disease  factors  that  were  found  in  these  subjects  owing  to  a 
relatively small subgroup which was not randomly chosen.  
In the worst-case scenario with exclusion of n=213 patients, the results of the 3m-CDP endpoint lost 
statistical significance in the remaining n=1432 patients that could not have been affected by unblinding. 
However, the results for the 6m-CDP, although not the primary but the clinically more relevant efficacy 
endpoint, were in the same direction. Another analysis excluding only those patients (n= 65) rated by 
EDSS  raters  with  temporary  access  to  potentially  unblinding  information  showed  a  risk  reduction  for 
siponimod relative to placebo of 20.0% (p =0.0236), which is in line with the risk reduction of the primary 
analysis in the overall study population. The same analysis in the active SPMS subjects excluding N=38 
patients rated by EDSS raters with temporary access to potentially unblinding information showed a risk 
reduction for siponimod relative to placebo of 28% (p =0.0222). This analysis is considered the most 
relevant given that the so excluded patients had –if at all- a realistic risk of being potentially unblinded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/652767/2019 
Page 153/163 
 
  
Regarding safety data, treatment with siponimod led to brady-arrhythmias, especially during the first 
weeks  of  treatment  initiation.  Macular  oedema,  another  well-known  class  effect  AE,  was  observed  in 
1.7% of the siponimod treated patients as compared to only 0.2% in the placebo patients. Other relevant 
AE were increased liver enzymes, SBP and DBP. An increased risk of infections during treatment with 
siponimod  consisting  mainly  of  reactivation  of  virus  and  fungus  infection  was  observed.  In  line  with 
evidence from other S1SP1 modulator, there were six cases of malignant melanoma in the siponimod 
group as compared to none in the placebo group. 
Overall, the safety profile is similar to fingolimod and is considered acceptable. Patients with hepatic or 
renal impairment and those aged greater than 61 years were not formally included in the trial and thus 
safety information is missing in these subgroups. Further information on older patients are particularly 
relevant as subgroup analyses suggested a lower effect of siponimod in this population (likely due to 
advanced  disease)  and  some  of  the  risks  could  be expected  to  be either increased  in  frequency  or  in 
clinical relevance due to immune senescence (infection, malignancies) or comorbidities and polytherapy 
(SDB, BPD, hepatic AE). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In SPMS, preventing or delaying the accumulation of disability is considered the most clinically relevant 
treatment goal. In the SPMS phase, accumulation of disability may be explained by the conjunction of 
pathological  mechanisms  including  focal  inflammatory  activity  (particularly  relevant  in  SPMS  with 
relapses  and  acute  inflammatory  lesions)  and  failure  of  biological  compensation  of  the  CNS  damage 
(impaired remyelination and lack of biological redundancy).  
In the opinion of CHMP and in agreement with SAG experts, the patients included in the pivotal study 
A2304 represent only partly the full spectrum of SPMS patients. As overall baseline characteristics and 
on-trial frequency of relapses indicate, the recruited population is representative of the “early” phase of 
SPMS where focal inflammatory activity as relevant pathogenic mechanism is still prominent.  
In the overall study population, the risk of 3m-CDP at a given point in time was approximately 21% (5-
35%) lower for patients in the siponimod group compared to the placebo group. However, results from 
subgroup analyses suggested that effect of siponimod on the rate of 3m-CDP was mainly driven by the 
effect  on  younger  patients  with  shorter  disease  duration  and  particularly  for  those  presenting  with 
markers of focal inflammatory activity at entry. This is further corroborated by the finding that in the 
subgroup of patients without signs and symptoms of disease activity effects on 3m-CDP and 6m-CDP 
were small (risk reductions were 7% and 13%, respectively).  
The patterns of changes in T2 lesion volume and relapse-based outcome were in line with these data. 
The mechanism of action of siponimod as a S1P1 modulator supports a role as immunomodulator for 
focal inflammatory activity in SPMS. In fact, the safety profile of siponimod is largely in line with that of 
fingolimod and considered acceptable. In line with SAG, the CHMP does not agree with the position of 
the  applicant  that  siponimod,  as  an  agent  crossing  BBB,  has  shown  to  have  an  additional  role  on 
neuroinflammation  (microglia)  and  remyelination  as  this  position  is  not  sustained  by  convincing 
experimental or clinical data.  
All above considered, the CHMP considered that an effect of siponimod independent of focal inflammatory 
activity was not robustly demonstrated and therefore, concluded that a positive benefit risk could only 
be  recommended  for  the  SPMS  population  with  inflammatory  activity.  Overall,  the  SAG  experts 
considered  that  this  phenotype  could  be  identifiable  by  MS  treating  specialist  with  close  clinical 
monitoring and use of periodic standardized MRI scan. In fact, and according to the SAG experts, this 
population  of  active  SPMS  is  usually  treated  off-label  with  a  DMT  authorized  for  RRMS  or  with  anti-
inflammatory/  immunosuppressant  drugs  not  authorized  for  MS  (regional  variability  mostly  due  to

Potential long-term safety implications in CYP2C9 poor metabolisers: 
• 
Perform genotyping for CYP2C9 before treatment initiation to determine the siponimod 
maintenance dose. Test requires a DNA sample obtained via blood or saliva (buccal swab). 
The test identifies two variant alleles for CYP2C9: CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853, c.430C>T) and 
CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, c.1075A>C). Both are single nucleotide polymorphisms. This 
genotyping can be done using a Sanger sequencing method or PCR-based assay methods. 
For further clarifications please refer to your local laboratory. 
Do not prescribe siponimod in patients homozygous for CYP2C9*3*3. 
Adjust the maintenance dose to 1 mg in patients with CYP2C9*2*3 or *1*3 genotypes. 
Bradyarrhythmia (including conduction defects) during treatment initiation: 
• 
Initiate treatment with a titration pack that lasts for 5 days. Start treatment with 0.25 mg 
on day 1, up-titrated to the maintenance dose of 2 mg or 1 mg on day 6 based on the 
CYP2C9 metaboliser status. 
If a titration dose is missed on one day during the first 6 days of treatment, treatment 
must be re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
If the maintenance dose is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, treatment 
must be re-initiated with a new titration pack. 
Monitoring requirements at treatment initiation: 
Prior to initiating treatment: 
o 
Perform vitals and baseline ECG prior to the first dose of siponimod in patients with 
sinus bradycardia (heart rate [HR] <55 bpm), history of first- or second-degree 
[Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure 
(patients with NYHA class I and II). 
Until 6 hours after first dose: 
o 
Observe patients with sinus bradycardia (heart rate <55 bpm), history of first- or 
second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block or a history of myocardial infarction or heart 
failure (patients with NYHA class I and II) for a period of 6 hours after the first dose

of siponimod for signs and symptoms of bradycardia and obtain an ECG at the end 
of the 6-hour monitoring period. 
If necessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by siponimod can be reversed by 
parenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. 
o 
Extended observation (>6 hours after first dose): 
o 
o 
o 
If, at the 6-hour time point, the heart rate is at the lowest value following the first 
dose, extend heart rate monitoring for at least 2 more hours and until the heart rate 
increases again. 
Extend heart rate monitoring for at least overnight in a medical facility and until 
resolution of findings in patients requiring pharmacological intervention during 
monitoring at treatment initiation/re-initiation. Repeat the first-dose monitoring 
after the second dose of siponimod. 
Appropriate management should be initiated and observation continued until the 
symptoms/findings have resolved if the following events are observed: 
a. 
b.  Where at the 6-hour time point the ECG shows: New onset second-degree or 
New onset third-degree AV block occurring at any time 
• 
• 
higher AV block, or QTc interval ≥500 msec 
If pharmacological treatment is required, monitoring should be continued overnight 
and 6-hour monitoring should be repeated after the second dose. 
Mayzent is contraindicated in: 
• 
• 
Patients who, in the previous 6 months, had a myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina pectoris, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart 
failure (requiring in-patient treatment), or New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
class III/IV heart failure. 
Patients with a history of second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) block, 
third-degree AV block, sino-atrial heart block or sick sinus syndrome, if they do not 
wear a pacemaker. 
Mayzent is not recommended in: 
• 
Patients with the below conditions. Siponimod treatment should be considered in 
these patients only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks and a 
cardiologist must be consulted to determine appropriate monitoring. At least 
overnight extended monitoring is recommended. 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
QTc prolongation >500 msec 
Severe untreated sleep apnoea 
History of symptomatic bradycardia 
History of recurrent syncope 
Uncontrolled hypertension 
Concomitant treatment with class Ia (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or 
class III anti-arrhythmic medications, calcium channel blockers (such as 
verapamil, diltiazem) and other medications (e.g. ivabradine or digoxin) which 
are known to decrease the heart rate 
• 
Infections, including varicella zoster reactivation, reactivation of the other viral infections, PML and 
other rare opportunistic infections: 
• 
There is an increased risk of infections including serious infections, in patients treated with 
siponimod. 
Before initiating treatment, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or 
after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also 
recommended periodically during treatment. 
Before starting siponimod, test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) in patients 
without a physician-confirmed history of varicella or without documentation of a full course 
of vaccination against VZV. If tested negative, vaccination is recommended and treatment 
with siponimod should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to 
occur. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with immunodeficiency syndrome.

Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with history of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. 
Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with severe active infection until infection 
is resolved. 
Exercise caution when administering concomitant treatment with anti-neoplastic, 
immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) due to the 
risk of additive immune system effects. 
Patients should be instructed to report signs and symptoms of infections immediately to 
their prescriber during and for up to one month after treatment with siponimod. 
Monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of infections during and after treatment 
with siponimod: 
• 
A case of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) has been reported for siponimod. Prompt 
diagnostic evaluation should be performed in patients with symptoms and signs 
consistent with cryptococcal meningitis; appropriate treatment, if diagnosed, should 
be initiated. Siponimod treatment should be suspended until CM has been excluded. 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported with 
another sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Physicians should be 
vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings suggestive of PML. If PML is suspected, 
treatment should be suspended until PML has been excluded. 
• 
Macular oedema: 
• 
Arrange an ophthalmological evaluation prior to initiating therapy and follow-up 
evaluations while receiving therapy in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, uveitis 
or underlying/co-existing retinal disease. 
An ophthalmological evaluation 3-4 months after treatment initiation with siponimod is 
recommended. 
Instruct the patient to report visual disturbances at any time while on siponimod therapy. 
Do not initiate siponimod treatment in patients with macular oedema until resolution. 
Reproductive toxicity: 
• 
Siponimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not 
using effective contraception. Advise women of potential serious risks to the foetus if 
siponimod is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it. 
A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to initiation of treatment in women of 
childbearing potential. 
Women of childbearing potential should be counselled before treatment initiation and 
regularly thereafter about the serious risks of siponimod to the foetus, facilitated by the 
pregnancy-specific patient reminder card. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 
at least 10 days following discontinuation of treatment with siponimod. 
Siponimod should be stopped at least 10 days before a pregnancy is planned. When 
stopping siponimod for planning a pregnancy the possible return of disease activity should 
be considered. 
Counsel the patient in case of inadvertent pregnancy. 
If a woman becomes pregnant while on treatment with siponimod, treatment must be 
discontinued. Pregnant women should be advised of potential serious risks to the foetus, 
and ultrasonography examinations should be performed. 
Should a pregnancy occur during treatment or within 10 days following discontinuation of 
treatment with siponimod, please report it to Novartis by calling [insert local number] or 
visiting [insert URL], irrespective of adverse outcomes observed. 
Novartis has put in place a PRegnancy outcomes Intensive Monitoring (PRIM) programme, 
which is a registry based on enhanced follow-up mechanisms to collect information about 
pregnancy in patients exposed to siponimod immediately before or during pregnancy and 
on infant outcomes 12 months post-delivery.

Other reminders: 
• 
Perform liver function tests prior to initiating siponimod treatment. If patients develop 
symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction during treatment with siponimod, request a 
liver enzymes check. Discontinue treatment if significant liver injury is confirmed. 
Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Be vigilant for skin malignancies while on treatment with siponimod. Patients treated with 
siponimod should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. These 
patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or 
PUVA-photochemotherapy. Siponimod is contraindicated in patients with active 
malignancies. 
Should a patient develop any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs or 
accelerated neurological deterioration, a complete physical and neurological examination 
should promptly be scheduled and MRI should be considered. 
Caution should be exercised in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities, or advanced 
disease/disability (due to possible increased risks of, for example, infections, 
bradyarrhythmic events during treatment initiation). 
If siponimod is discontinued, the possibility of recurrence of high disease activity should be 
considered. 
Provide patients with the Patient/Caregiver Guide and Pregnancy Reminder Card for 
women of childbearing potential. 
Be familiar with the Mayzent Prescribing Information.

Patients should read the package leaflet thoroughly before starting treatment and should keep 
the package leaflet in case they need to refer to it again during treatment. 
The importance of reporting adverse reactions. 
Before starting treatment, a DNA sample via blood or saliva (buccal swab) is taken to determine 
the CYP2C9 genotype to help determine appropriate dosing of siponimod. In certain cases the 
patient may not receive treatment with siponimod due to specific CYP2C9 genotype status. 
Patients need to have chickenpox vaccination 1 month before starting siponimod treatment, if 
the patient is not protected against the virus. 
Siponimod is not recommended in patients with cardiac disease or taking concomitant medicines 
known to decrease heart rate. Patients should tell any doctor they see that they are being 
treated with siponimod. 
For patients with certain heart problems, an ECG before initiating treatment with siponimod will 
be needed. The need for observation (including an ECG monitoring) for 6 hours in a clinic after 
the first dose of siponimod on day 1, if the patient has heart problems. Information that the 
monitoring may need to extend overnight, if the patient experiences symptoms during the first 
6 hours. 
Patients should report immediately symptoms indicating low heart rate (such as dizziness, 
vertigo, nausea or palpitations) after the first dose of siponimod and during the titration period. 
Before starting treatment patients should provide a recent complete blood count. 
The signs and symptoms of infection during, and up to one month after treatment with 
siponimod need to be reported immediately to the prescriber. 
Patients should report any symptoms of visual impairment immediately to the prescriber during 
and for up to one month after the end of treatment with siponimod. 
Patients should call the doctor if a dose is missed during the first 6 days of treatment or for 4 or 
more consecutive days after initiating treatment with siponimod. Treatment needs to be 
reinitiated with a new titration pack. 
Liver function tests should be performed before starting treatment and repeated if there are

symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. 
Patients should report any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (such as 
sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, seizures and vision changes) or accelerated 
neurological deterioration to their doctors. 
Due to the potential teratogenic risk of siponimod women of childbearing potential should: 
• 
Be informed before treatment initiation and regularly thereafter by their physician about 
siponimod serious risks to the foetus and about the contraindication in pregnant women 
and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, facilitated by the 
Pregnancy Reminder Card. 
Have a negative pregnancy test before starting siponimod, which should be repeated at 
suitable intervals. 
Be using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 10 days after stopping 
treatment to avoid pregnancy due to the potential risk of harm to the unborn baby. 
Report immediately to the prescribing physician any (intended or unintended) pregnancy, 
during treatment and up to 10 days following discontinuation of siponimod treatment. 
• 
• 
• 
Patients should be informed about the risk of skin malignancies while on treatment with 
siponimod and should be cautioned against exposure to sunlight without protection. Also, these 
patients should not receive concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or 
PUVA-photochemotherapy. 
After stopping treatment with Mayzent, patients should inform their doctor immediately if their 
disease symptoms are getting worse (e.g. weakness or visual changes) or if they notice any new 
symptoms.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 14 NOVEMBER 2019 
Mayzent EMEA/H/C/004712 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation for Mayzent indicated for the “treatment of adult patients 
with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease evidenced by relapses or 
imaging features of inflammatory activity (see section 5.1).” 
The reasons for divergent opinion were the following: 
In the setting of a single pivotal study, efficacy in the proposed indication has not been convincingly 
demonstrated.  
The internal validity of the single pivotal study is compromised due to potential unblinding of study 
personnel. Analyses of results in potentially unblinded and not unblinded patients strongly suggests 
that unintentional unblinding impacted the primary efficacy results to a degree making the effect size 
estimated when including all patients unreliable. In the subgroup of potentially unblinded patients, 
there was a disproportionally large treatment effect estimated and exclusion of these patients from the 
overall study population led to a decrease in apparent effect size for the remaining patients not 
affected by potential unblinding. Once the totality of patients with active SPMS who may be potentially 
unblinded are excluded (120 out of 658), the primary endpoint (3-month confirmed disease 
progression) does not reach statistical significance (HR 0.81; 95% CI: 059, 1.10). While the 6-month 
CDP is statistically significant (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.96), it is not corrected for multiplicity.  
In order to support a claim for an effect on disability progression in SPMS, the current EMA guideline 
on multiple sclerosis, recommends targeting “SPMS patients without a recent relapse and no MRI 
activity suggestive of active inflammation and with evidence of recent progression independently of 
relapses. This is needed to exclude possible effects of relapse activity on disability." Nonetheless, the 
applicant has included a substantial proportion of patients with active disease (evidenced by relapses 
or imaging features of inflammatory activity) and the proposed indication specifically includes only 
these patients. Furthermore, on-study relapses occurred, and it was not possible reliably to assess 
effects of siponimod on disease progression independent of relapses in SPMS in terms of both clinical 
relevance and statistical significance. Thus, results are not considered compelling in terms of 
demonstrating clinical relevant effect on disability progression independent on an effect on relapses. 
In view of the above considerations the undersigned delegates consider the benefit risk of this product 
to be negative.

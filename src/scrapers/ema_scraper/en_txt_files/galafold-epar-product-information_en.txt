4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Galafold is indicated for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with a 
confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) and who have an amenable 
mutation (see the tables in section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Galafold should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease. Galafold is not intended for concomitant use with enzyme 
replacement therapy (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
The recommended dosage regimen is 123 mg migalastat (1 capsule) taken once every other day at the 
same time of the day. 
Missed dose 
Galafold should not be taken on 2 consecutive days. If a dose is missed entirely for the day, the patient 
should take the missed dose of Galafold only if it is within 12 hours of the normal time the dose is 
taken. If more than 12 hours has passed the patient should resume taking Galafold at the next planned 
dosing day and time according to the every other day dosing schedule.

Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dosage adjustment is required based on age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Galafold is not recommended for use in patients with Fabry disease who have estimated GFR less than 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment of Galafold is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Adolescents aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 45 kg 
123 mg migalastat (1 capsule) taken once every other day at the same time of the day (see section 5.2). 
Children <12 years  
The safety and efficacy of Galafold in children aged less than 12 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
For oral use. 
Galafold exposure is decreased by approximately 40% when taken with food and 60% when taken 
with coffee (see section 4.5 and 5.2). Food and caffeine should not be consumed at least 2 hours 
before and 2 hours after taking Galafold to give a minimum 4 hours fast (see section 4.5).  
Water (plain, flavored, sweetened), fruit juices without pulp, and caffeine-free carbonated beverages 
can be consumed during the 4-hour fasting period.  
Galafold should be taken every other day at the same time of day to ensure optimal benefits to the 
patient. 
Capsules must be swallowed whole. The capsules must not be cut, crushed, or chewed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
It is advised to periodically monitor renal function, echocardiographic parameters and biochemical 
markers (every 6 months) in patients initiated on or switched to migalastat. In case of meaningful 
clinical deterioration, further clinical evaluation or discontinuation of treatment with Galafold should 
be considered. 
Galafold is not indicated for use in patients with non-amenable mutations (see section 5.1).

No reduction in proteinuria was observed in patients treated with Galafold. Galafold is not 
recommended for use in patients with severe renal insufficiency, defined as estimated GFR less than 
30 mL/min/1.73m2 (see section 5.2). 
Limited data suggest that co-administration of a single dose of migalastat and a standard enzyme 
replacement therapy infusion results in an increased exposure to agalsidase of up to 5-fold. This study 
also indicated that agalsidase has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of migalastat. Galafold is not 
intended for concomitant use with enzyme replacement therapy. 
Paediatric population 
123 mg migalastat capsules are not for children (≥ 12 years) weighing less than 45 kg, (see section 
5.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Based upon in vitro data, migalastat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Furthermore, 
migalastat is not an inhibitor or a substrate of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 
3A4/5. Migalastat is not a substrate for MDR1 or BCRP, nor is it an inhibitor of BCRP, MDR1, or 
BSEP human efflux transporters. In addition, migalastat is not a substrate for MATE1, MATE2-K, 
OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2, nor is it an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, 
MATE1, or MATE2-K human uptake transporters. 
Effect of other drugs on migalastat 
Co-administration of migalastat with caffeine decreases migalastat systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) 
which may reduce Galafold efficacy (see section 5.2). Avoid co-administration of Galafold with 
caffeine at least 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking Galafold (see section 4.2).  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Galafold is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of Galafold in pregnant women. In rabbits, developmental toxicity 
was observed only at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3). Galafold is not recommended during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether Galafold is secreted in human milk. However, migalastat has been shown to 
be expressed in the milk of lactating rats. Accordingly, a risk of migalastat exposure to the 
breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue Galafold, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child relative to the benefit of therapy for the mother. 
Fertility 
The effects of Galafold on fertility in humans have not been studied. Transient and fully reversible 
infertility in male rats was associated with migalastat treatment at all doses assessed. Complete 
reversibility was seen after 4 weeks off-dose. Similar findings have been noted pre-clinically 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following treatment with other iminosugars (see section 5.3). Migalastat did not affect fertility in 
female rats. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Galafold has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reaction was headache, which was experienced by approximately 10% of 
patients who received Galafold. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 
to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing frequency within each System Organ Class.

Adolescent population 
The safety assessment in 21 adolescents (12 to <18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg) is based on 
1-year safety data from the open label AT1001-020 trial in which subjects received the same dosage 
regimen as adults (see section 5.2). No age-specific differences in adverse reactions were observed 
between adolescent and adult subjects. The frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in 
adolescents are expected to be the same as in adults based on these data. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, general medical care is recommended. Headache and dizziness were the most 
common adverse reactions reported at doses of Galafold of up to 1250 mg and 2000 mg, respectively.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract 
and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX14 
Fabry disease is a progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder which affects males and females. 
Fabry disease-causing mutations in the GLA gene result in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme 
-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) that is required for glycosphingolipid substrate (e.g., GL-3, lyso-Gb3) 
metabolism. Reduced α-Gal A activity is, therefore, associated with the progressive accumulation of 
substrate in vulnerable organs and tissues, which leads to the morbidity and mortality associated with 
Fabry disease. 
Mechanism of action 
Certain GLA mutations can result in the production of abnormally folded and unstable mutant forms of 
α-Gal A. Migalastat is a pharmacological chaperone that is designed to selectively and reversibly bind 
with high affinity to the active sites of certain mutant forms of α-Gal A, the genotypes of which are 
referred to as amenable mutations. Migalastat binding stabilises these mutant forms of α-Gal A in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates their proper trafficking to lysosomes. Once in lysosomes 
dissociation of migalastat restores α-Gal A activity, leading to the catabolism of GL-3 and related 
substrates. 
The GLA mutations amenable to treatment with Galafold are listed in Table 2 below. The GLA 
mutations are also accessible by health care providers at www.galafoldamenabilitytable.com. 
The nucleotide changes listed represent potential DNA sequence changes that result in the amino acid 
mutation. The amino acid mutation (protein sequence change) is most relevant when determining 
amenability. If a double mutation is present on the same chromosome (males and females), that patient 
is amenable if the double mutation is present in one entry in Table 2 (e.g., D55V/Q57L). If a double 
mutation is present on different chromosomes (only in females) that patient is amenable if either one 
of the individual mutations is present in Table 2.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
Treatment with Galafold in phase 2 pharmacodynamic studies generally resulted in increases in 
endogenous α-Gal A activity in WBCs, as well as in skin and kidney for the majority of patients. In 
patients with amenable mutations, GL-3 levels tended to decrease in urine and in kidney interstitial 
capillaries. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical efficacy and safety of Galafold have been evaluated in two phase 3 pivotal clinical studies 
and two open-label extension (OLE) clinical studies. All patients received the recommended dosage of 
123 mg Galafold every other day. 
The first phase 3 clinical study (ATTRACT) was a randomised open-label active comparator study 
that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Galafold compared to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
(agalsidase beta, agalsidase alfa) in 52 male and female patients with Fabry disease who were 
receiving ERT prior to clinical study entry and who have amenable mutations (ERT-experienced 
clinical study). The clinical study was structured in two periods. During the first period (18-months) 
ERT-experienced patients were randomised to switch from ERT to Galafold or continue with ERT. 
The second period was an optional 12-month open-label extension in which all subjects received 
Galafold. 
The second phase 3 clinical study (FACETS) was a 6-month randomised double-blind 
placebo-controlled study (through month 6) with an 18-month open-label period to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Galafold in 50 male and female patients with Fabry disease who were naïve to 
ERT, or had previously been on ERT and had stopped for at least 6 months and who have amenable 
mutations (ERT-naïve study). 
The first OLE clinical study (AT1001-041) included patients from phase 2 and phase 3 studies and has 
completed. The mean extent of exposure to the marketed dose of migalastat 123 mg QOD in patients 
completing study AT1001-041 was 3.57 (±1.23) years (n=85). The maximum exposure was 5.6 years. 
The second OLE clinical study (AT1001-042) included patients that either transferred from OLE study 
AT1001-041 or directly from phase 3 study ATTRACT. The mean extent of exposure to the marketed 
dose of Galafold 123 mg QOD in patients in this study was 32.3 (±12.3) months (n=82). The 
maximum exposure was 51.9 months. 
Renal function  
In the ERT-experienced clinical study, renal function remained stable for up to 18 months of treatment 
with Galafold. Mean annualised rate of change in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.40 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% 
CI: -2.272, 1.478; n=34) in the Galafold group compared to -1.03 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -3.636, 
1.575; n=18) in the ERT group. The mean annualised rate of change from baseline in eGFRCKD-EPI in 
patients treated for 30 months with Galafold was -1.72 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -2.653, -0.782; 
n=31). 
In the ERT-naïve clinical study and open-label extension, renal function remained stable for up to 5 
years of treatment with Galafold. After an average of 3.4 years of treatment, the mean annualised rate 
of change in eGFRCKD-EPI was -0.74 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -1.89, 0.40; n=41). No clinically 
significant differences were observed during the initial 6-month placebo-controlled period. 
Data for the annualised rate of change for eGRFCKD-EPI was pooled for ERT-naïve subjects and 
ERT-experienced subjects with amenable mutations; the results showed the durability of renal 
stabilization up to 8.6 years in annualised rate of change. After a mean duration of 5.2 years, ERT-
naïve patients had a mean annualised rate of change from baseline of -1.71 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-2.83, -0.60; n=47). After a mean duration of 4.3 years, ERT-experienced patients had a mean 
annualised rate of change from baseline of -1.78 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -3.76, 0.20; n=49).
Left ventricular mass index (LVMi)  
In the ERT-experienced clinical study, following 18 months of treatment with Galafold there was a 
statistically significant decrease in LVMi (p<0.05). The baseline values were 95.3 g/m2 for the 
Galafold arm and 92.9 g/m2 for the ERT arm and the mean change from baseline in LVMi at month 18 
was -6.6 (95% CI: -11.0, -2.1; n=31) for Galafold and -2.0 (95% CI: -11.0, 7.0; n=13) for ERT. The 
change from baseline to month 18 in LVMi (g/m2) in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy 
(females with baseline LVMi >95 g/m2 and males with baseline LVMi >115 g/m2) was -8.4 (95% 
CI: -15.7, 2.6; n=13) for Galafold and 4.5 (95% CI: -10.7, 18.4; n=5) for ERT. After 30 months 
treatment with Galafold, the mean change from baseline in LVMi was -3.8 (95% CI: -8.9, 1.3; n=28) 
and the mean change from baseline in LVMi in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline 
was -10.0 (95% CI: -16.6, -3.3; n=10). 
In the ERT-naïve clinical study, Galafold resulted in a statistically significant decrease in LVMi 
(p<0.05); the mean change from baseline in LVMi at month 18 to 24 was -7.7 (95% CI: -15.4, -0.01; 
n=27). After follow-up in the OLE, the mean change from baseline in LVMi at month 36 was -8.3 
(95% CI: -17.1, 0.4; n=25) and at month 48 was -9.1 (95% CI: -20.3, 2.0; n=18). The mean change 
from baseline in LVMi at month 18 to 24 in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline 
(females with baseline LVMi >95 g/m2 or males with baseline LVMi >115 g/m2) was -18.6 (95% 
CI: -38.2, 1.0; n=8). After follow-up in the OLE, the mean change from baseline in LVMi at month 36 
in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline was -30.0 (95% CI: -57.9, -2.2; n=4) and at 
month 48 was -33.1 (95% CI: -60.9, -5.4; n=4). No clinically significant differences in LVMi were 
observed during the initial 6-month placebo-controlled period. 
In the ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve clinical studies, after follow up in OLE clinical study 
AT1001-042, the mean change in LVMi from AT1001-042 baseline was 1.2 g/m2 (95% CI: -5.3, 7.7; 
n=15) and -5.6 g/m2 (95% CI: -28.5, 17.2; n=4) respectively, for patients treated with Galafold for an 
average of 2.4 and 2.9 years (up to 4.0 and 4.3 years, respectively). 
Disease substrate 
In the ERT-experienced clinical study, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels slightly increased but remained low in 
patients with amenable mutations treated with Galafold for the 30-month duration of the study. Plasma 
lyso-Gb3 levels also remained low in patients on ERT for up to 18 months. 
In the ERT- naïve clinical study, Galafold showed statistically significant reductions in plasma 
lyso-Gb3 concentrations and kidney interstitial capillary GL-3 inclusions in patients with amenable 
mutations. Patients randomised to Galafold in Stage 1 demonstrated statistically significant greater 
reduction (±SEM) in mean interstitial capillary GL-3 deposition (-0.25±0.10; -39%) at month 6 
compared to placebo (+0.07 ± 0.13; +14%) (p=0.008). Patients randomised to placebo in Stage 1 and 
switched to Galafold at month 6 (Stage 2) also demonstrated statistically significant decreases in 
interstitial capillary GL-3 inclusions at month 12 (-0.33±0.15; -58%) (p=0.014). Qualitative reductions 
in GL-3 levels were observed in multiple renal cell types: podocytes, mesangial cells, and glomerular 
endothelial cells, respectively, over 12 months of treatment with Galafold. 
Composite clinical outcomes 
In the ERT-experienced clinical study, an analysis of a composite clinical outcome composed of renal, 
cardiac, and cerebrovascular events, or death, showed that the frequency of events observed in the 
Galafold treatment group was 29% compared to 44% in the ERT group over 18 months. The 
frequency of events in patients treated with Galafold over 30 months (32%) was similar to the 
18-month period.

Patient-reported outcome - gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale 
In the ERT-naïve clinical study, analyses of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale demonstrated 
that treatment with Galafold was associated with statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements 
versus placebo from baseline to month 6 in the diarrhoea domain, and in the reflux domain for patients 
with symptoms at baseline. During the open-label extension, statistically significant (p<0.05) 
improvements from baseline were observed in the diarrhoea and indigestion domains, with a trend of 
improvement in the constipation domain. 
Paediatric population 
In Study AT1001-020, a 1-year, Phase 3b, open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre study, the safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy of migalastat treatment was evaluated in 21 adolescent subjects 
(12 to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg) with Fabry disease and who have amenable mutations 
of the gene encoding α-galactosidase A (GLA). Subjects were either naïve to enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) or had stopped ERT at least 14 days before screening. The mean number of years since 
diagnosis of Fabry disease was  9.6 (± 4.25) years.  
At 1 year, the efficacy results in adolescents on the same dosing regimen as adults were consistent in 
renal, cardiac, and pharmacodynamic results as well as responses to patient-reported outcomes. The 
overall mean (SD) change from baseline in eGFR was -1.6 (15.4) mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=19). The overall 
mean (SD) change from baseline for LVMi was -3.9 (13.5) g/m2 (n=18). LVMi decreased in 
10 subjects and increased in 8 subjects, but all subjects remained within normal limits at 12 months. 
Baseline plasma lyso-Gb3 was 12.00 ng/mL and the overall mean (SD) change from baseline in 
plasma lyso-Gb3 was -0.06 (32.9) (n=19). A reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 from baseline was observed 
in ERT-naïve subjects (median -2.23 ng/ml, n=9) and levels remained generally stable in 
ERT-experienced subjects (median 0.54 ng/ml, n=10). There were no notable changes in patient 
reported outcomes. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Galafold in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Fabry disease (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability (AUC) for a single oral 150 mg migalastat hydrochloride dose or a single 
2-hour 150 mg intravenous infusion was approximately 75%. Following a single oral dose of 150 mg 
migalastat hydrochloride solution, the time to peak plasma concentration was approximately 3 hours. 
Plasma migalastat exposure (AUC0-∞) and Cmax demonstrated dose-proportional increases at migalastat 
hydrochloride oral doses from 50 mg to 1,250 mg in adults. 
Migalastat administered with a high-fat meal, or 1 hour before a high-fat or light meal, or 1 hour after 
a light meal, resulted in significant reductions of 37% to 42% in mean total migalastat exposure 
(AUC0-∞) and reductions of 15% to 40% in mean peak migalastat exposure (Cmax) compared with the 
fasting state (see section 4.2).  
Compared to intake of a single dose of migalastat with water, intake with coffee containing 
approximately 190 mg caffeine resulted in a significant decrease in migalastat systemic exposure 
(mean reduction in AUC0-∞ by 55% and mean reduction in Cmax by 60%). The rate of absorption (tmax) 
of migalastat was not affected by administration of caffeine in comparison to water. No effect was 
observed when migalastat was taken with natural (sucrose) and artificial (aspartame or acesulfame K) 
sweeteners (see section 4.2 and 4.5). 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
In healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution (Vz/F) of migalastat following ascending single oral 
doses (25 to 675 mg migalastat hydrochloride) ranged from 77 to 133 L, indicating it is well 
distributed into tissues and greater than total body water (42 litres). There was no detectable plasma 
protein binding following administration of [14C]-migalastat hydrochloride in the concentration range 
between 1 and 100 M. 
Biotransformation 
Based upon in vivo data, migalastat is a substrate for UGT, being a minor elimination pathway. 
Migalastat is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gP) in vitro and it is considered unlikely that 
migalastat would be subject to drug-drug interactions with cytochrome P450s. A pharmacokinetic 
study in healthy male volunteers with 150 mg [14C]-migalastat hydrochloride revealed that 99% of the 
radiolabelled dose recovered in plasma was comprised of unchanged migalastat (77%) and 3 
dehydrogenated O-glucuronide conjugated metabolites, M1to M3 (13%). Approximately 9% of the 
total radioactivity was unassigned.  
Elimination 
A pharmacokinetic study in healthy male volunteers with 150 mg [14C]-migalastat hydrochloride 
revealed that approximately 77% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine of which 55% of was 
excreted as unchanged migalastat and 4% as combined metabolites M1, M2 and M3. Approximately 
5% of the total sample radioactivity was unassigned components. Approximately 20% of the total 
radiolabeled dose was excreted in faeces, with unchanged migalastat being the only measured 
component. 
Following ascending single oral doses (25 to 675 mg migalastat hydrochloride), no trends were found 
for clearance, CL/F. At the 150 mg dose, CL/F was approximately 11 to 14 L/hr. Following 
administration of the same doses, the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) ranged from approximately 3 to 
5 hours.  
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Galafold has not been studied in patients with Fabry disease who have a GFR less than 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2. In a single dose study with Galafold in non-Fabry subjects with varying degrees 
of renal insufficiency, exposures were increased by 4.3-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment 
(GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No studies have been carried out in subjects with impaired hepatic function. From the metabolism and 
excretion pathways, it is not expected that a decreased hepatic function may affect the 
pharmacokinetics of migalastat. 
Elderly (>65 years) 
Clinical studies of Galafold included small number of patients aged 65 and over. The effect of age was 
evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis on plasma migalastat clearance in the ERT-naïve 
study population. The difference in clearance between Fabry patients ≥ 65 years and those < 65 years 
was 20%, which was not considered clinically significant. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of migalastat were characterised in 20 adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years and 
weighing ≥45 kg) with Fabry disease who received the same dosage regimen as adults (123 mg 
migalastat capsule every other day) in an open label phase 3b trial (AT1001-020). 
Assessment of bioequivalence of exposure was simulated in adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years) 
weighing ≥ 45 kg and receiving migalastat 123 mg once every other day compared to adults receiving 
the same dosing regimen. Model derived AUCtau in adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years) were similar 
to adult exposures. 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of migalastat were not significantly different between females and 
males in either healthy volunteers or in patients with Fabry disease. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical studies suggest no specific hazard for humans on the basis of single-and repeat-dose 
studies, with the exception of transient and fully reversible infertility in male rats associated with 
migalastat treatment. The infertility associated with migalastat treatment was reported at clinically 
relevant exposures. Complete reversibility was seen after 4 weeks off-dose. Similar findings have been 
noted pre-clinically following treatment with other iminosugars. In the rabbit embryo-foetal toxicity 
study, findings including embryo-foetal death, a reduction in mean foetal weight, retarded ossification, 
and slightly increased incidences of minor skeletal abnormalities were observed only at doses 
associated with maternal toxicity. 
In a rat 104-week carcinogenicity study, there was an increased incidence of pancreatic islet cell 
adenomas in males at a dose level 19-fold higher than the exposure (AUC) at the clinically efficacious 
dose. This is a common spontaneous tumour in ad libitum-fed male rats. In the absence of similar 
findings in females, no findings in the genotoxicity battery or in the carcinogenicity study with 
Tg.rasH2 mice, and no pre-neoplastic pancreatic findings in the rodents or monkeys, this observation 
in male rats is not considered related to treatment and its relevance to humans is unknown.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Galafold is and what it is used for  
Galafold contains the active substance migalastat. 
This medicine is used for the long-term treatment of Fabry disease in adults and adolescents aged 
12 years and older who have certain genetic mutations (changes).  
Fabry disease is caused by the lack of or a faulty enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). 
Depending upon the kind of mutation (change) in the gene that produces α-Gal A, the enzyme does 
not work properly or is completely absent. This enzyme defect leads to abnormal deposits of a fatty 
substance known as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in kidneys, heart, and other organs, leading to the 
symptoms of Fabry disease.  
This medicine works by stabilising the enzyme that your body produces naturally, so that it can work 
better to reduce the amount of GL-3 that has accumulated in your cells and tissues. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Galafold 
Do not take Galafold if you: 
• 
are allergic to migalastat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
123 mg migalastat capsules are not for children (≥12 years) weighing less than 45 kg. 
Talk to your doctor before taking Galafold if you are currently taking enzyme replacement therapy. 
You should not take Galafold if you are also receiving enzyme replacement therapy.  
Your doctor will monitor your condition and whether your medicine is working every 6 months while 
you are taking Galafold. If your condition worsens, your doctor may evaluate you further or may 
discontinue your treatment with Galafold. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor before taking Galafold if you have severely reduced kidney function as Galafold is 
not recommended for use in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR less than 
30 mL/min/1.73m2). 
Children 
Children <12 years 
This medicine has not been studied in children under the age of 12; therefore, the safety and efficacy 
in this age group has not been established. 
Other medicines and Galafold 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including supplements and herbal 
medicines. 
Especially tell your doctor if you take caffeine containing medicines or supplements as these 
medicines may affect how Galafold works if taken during fasting period.  
Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your doctor and pharmacist each time 
you get a new medicine.    
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility 
Pregnancy 
There is very limited experience with the use of this medicine in pregnant women. Galafold is not 
recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to 
have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Women who could become pregnant should use effective birth control while taking Galafold.  
Breast-feeding 
Do not take this medicine if you are breast-feeding, until you have spoken with your doctor, 
pharmacist, or nurse. It is not yet known whether this medicine passes into breast milk. Your doctor 
will decide whether you need to stop breast-feeding or temporarily stop your medicine, considering 
the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Galafold to the mother. 
Fertility in men 
It is not yet known if this medicine affects fertility in men. The effects of Galafold on fertility in 
humans have not been studied. 
Fertility in women 
It is not yet known if this medicine affects fertility in women. 
If you are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3.  How to take Galafold 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse has told you. Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Take one capsule every other day at the same time of the day. Do not take Galafold on two 
consecutive days. 
Do not consume food or caffeine at least 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking your medicine. This 
minimum 4 hours fast around taking your medicine is needed to allow your medicine to be fully 
absorbed.  
Water (plain, flavored, sweetened), fruit juices without pulp, and caffeine-free carbonated beverages 
can be consumed during the 4-hour fasting period. 
Swallow the capsule whole. Do not cut, crush, or chew the capsule.

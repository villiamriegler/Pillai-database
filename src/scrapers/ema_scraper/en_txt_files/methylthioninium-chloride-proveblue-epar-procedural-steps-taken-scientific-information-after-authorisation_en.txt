are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

information has been added to sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC: 
Section 4.5 
Methylthioninium chloride is an in vitro inhibitor of CYP1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5. The clinical 
consequences of increases plasma concentration of co-
administered drugs which are sensitive CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A substrates cannot be ruled out.  
Methylthioninium chloride is an in vitro inducer of CYP1A2. 
The clinical consequence is not known. 
The administration of methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 
has the potential to transiently increase or decrease the 
clearance of drugs that are primarily metabolized by these 
enzymes. The clinical consequences are however 
considered minimal since methylthioninium chloride 
Proveblue is used often only once and in an acute 
emergency setting. 
Methylthioninium chloride is a potent inhibitor of the 
transporters OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
The clinical consequences of the inhibition are not known. 
The administration of methylthioninium chloride Proveblue 
has the potential to transiently increase the exposure of 
drugs primarily cleared by renal transport involving the 
OCT2/MATE pathway, including cimetidine, metformin and 
acyclovir.  
Methylthioninium chloride is a substrate of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). The clinical consequences are considered likely to 
Page 7/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be minimal due to the transient and single dose use that 
normally occurs in the emergency setting. 
Section 5.2 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is not an in vitro 
inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is an in vitro inhibitor 
of P-gp. 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue is not an in vitro 
substrate for BCRP or OCT2 and is not an in vitro inhibitor 
of BCRP, OAT1 or OAT3.

PROCEDURAL STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING 
AUTHORISATION 
For procedures finalised after 1 July 2004 please refer to module 8B. 
At  the  time  the  initial  positive  opinion  was  granted,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the  scientific 
knowledge  for  products  made  using  biotechnology  is  not  static  due  to  the  rapidly  evolving 
methodology  in  this  field  of  science.  Therefore  new  information  will  usually  be  generated  on  an 
ongoing basis after Marketing Authorisation is granted. The CPMP should be kept informed about any 
new data. The company fulfilled its commitment to submit to the EMEA before 31 October 1995 the 
final report  of the in vitro fertilisation study performed in the  United States  of  America. The CPMP 
considered the results to be satisfactory confirming the safety and efficacy of Gonal-F. 
Although  the  pharmaceutical/biotechnological  quality  of  the  Gonal-F  dossier  has  been  proven 
sufficient  to  support  marketing  at  this  stage,  there  were  a  number  of  open  points  concerning 
biopharmaceutical  characteristics  and  validation  of  some  of  the  new  methodologies  used  in  the 
production  process  of  Gonal-F.  To  this  end  also  new  testing  methods  should  be  developed.  The 
company  has  agreed  with  the  CPMP  to  provide  within  6  to  12  months,  depending  on  the  case, 
appropriate  information  on  the  quality  points  identified  during  the  Assessment  (See  chapter  III.2). 
These follow-up measures have been addressed with submissions on 30 April 1996, 17 October 1996, 
6 June 1997, 9 January 1998 and 31 March 2001.  
Following  the  positive  opinion  on  the  new  indication:  anovulation  (including  polycystic  ovarian 
disease)  in  women  who  have  been  unresponsive  to  treatment  with  clomiphene  citrate,  the  CPMP 
requested the company to submit the results of additional ongoing clinical studies relating to the new 
indication . The additional results were submitted on 13 March 1998 and were found satisfactory.  
Extensions / Major Variations 
- New strength: Gonal-F 37.5 IU  
On 25 February 1999, the CPMP issued a positive opinion for the new strength Gonal-F 37.5 IU. The 
procedure  started  on  29  May  1998.  Although  the  SPC  recommended  a  37.5  IU  dose  titration  for 
anovulatory  indications,  such  strength  was  not  available.  Inclusion  of  the  37.5  IU  strength  will 
eliminate wastage, will facilitate adjustment of the treatment, and will minimise the chance of dosage 
mistakes as a result of the use of a  fraction of previous dosage strengths. The Commission Decision 
for this extension was issued on 18 June 1999. 
- New strength: Gonal-F 600 IU/ml (multidose presentation) 
On 21 September 2000, the CPMP issued a positive opinion for the addition of a new strength Gonal-
F  600  IU/ml.  The  procedure  started  on  17  December  1999.  This  new  strength  is  a  multidose 
presentation of Gonal-F and provides  improved convenience for patients who are self-dosing at home. 
It  also  simplifies  treatment  tailoring,  allowing  dose  titration  by  adapting  the  volume  to  be  injected. 
This multidose vial containing preservative is not to be shared amongst patients; therefore it should be 
used  by  one  patient  only  (as  stated  in  the  SPC).  The  Commission  Decision  for  this  extension  was 
issued on 29 January 2001. 
- Addition of new monodose presentations with the solvent presented in pre-filled syringes 
On  13  December  2001,  the  CPMP  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  the  addition  of  new  monodose 
presentations  with  the  solvent  presented  in  prefilled  syringes.  The  new  presentations  of  the  solvent 
consist  of  1.1  ml  sterilised  water  for  injections  (Ph.Eur.)  in  pre-filled  syringes  (Type  I  Ph.Eur. 
colourless  glass).  Pack  sizes  are:  1,  5,  and  10  pre-filled  syringes.  Except  for  a  limited  number  of 
points,  which  can  be  addressed as  part  of  post-authorisation  commitments,  the  quality  of  these  new 
presentation is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the 
SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the new 
1/5

presentations have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Viral safety and batch-
to-batch  consistency  has  been  documented  and  the  relevant  test  will  be  performed  according  to  the 
agreed specifications. The Commission Decision for this Type II variation was issued on 7 July 2002. 
- Addition of a new pharmaceutical form 
On  25  September  2003,  the  CPMP  considered  that  the benefit/risk  profile  of  a  new  pharmaceutical 
form  for  GONAL-f    (i.e.  solution  for  injection  presented  in  a  pre-filled  pen)  was  favourable.  A 
positive  opinion  was therefore adopted on the addition  of this new  pharmaceutical form, a ready-to-
use formulation designed to facilitate the administration of the product. The Commission Decision for 
this extension was issued on 23 February 2004. 
- Addition for a new multidose presentation 
On  25  September  2003,  the  CPMP  adopted  a  positive  opinion  for  a  Type  II  for  a  new  multidose 
presentation  for  GONAL-f  powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection  300  IU/0.50  ml  (22 
micrograms/0.50ml). After reconstitution with 0.75 ml of solvent, its concentration is the same as for 
the  already  authorised  multidose  presentations  i.e.  600  IU/ml.  The  Commission  Decision  for  this 
variation was issued on 14 January 2004. 
Renewal of the Marketing Authorisation 
For  the  first  renewal  of  Gonal-F,  the  CPMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  quality,  the  safety  and  the 
efficacy  of  this  medicinal  product  continued  to  be  adequately  and  sufficiently  demonstrated  and 
therefore  considered  that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Gonal-F  continued  to  be  favourable  for  the 
authorised  indications  and  issued  on  21  September  2000  a  positive  opinion  for  the  renewal  of  the 
Marketing  Authorisation.  The  Commission  Decision 
issued  on  
29 December 2000.

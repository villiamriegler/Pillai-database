•  Study design 
The  study  was  an  open  study  with  two  parallel  groups  which  included  subjects  from  a  single  centre. 
The vaccination schedules were as follows: 
Pn-Pn group: Booster vaccination at 15-21 months of age. 
• 
•  Zil-Pn  group:  Two-dose  catch-up  vaccination  at  15-21  months  and  17-23  months  of  age, 
with an interval of 56-118 days. 
A booster dose of DTPa vaccine was co-administered with a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine 
or the first dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT catch-up vaccination (at 15-21 months of age). 
Blood sampling: two blood samples were collected in each group. 
Pn-Pn group: prior to and one month post-booster vaccination 
• 
•  Zil-Pn group: pre-vaccination and one month post-dose 2  
Type of study: 
• 
Pn-Pn group: booster vaccination study following primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-DIT-
032. 
•  Zil-Pn group: catch-up vaccination study in children during their second year of life. 
Data collection: hard copy Case Report Form (CRF). 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Healthy  male  or  female  subjects,  between  and  including  15-21  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  Visit  1. 
Subjects in the Pn-Pn group should have completed the full vaccination course with 10Pn-PD-DiT in the 
study 10PN-PD-DIT-032. Subjects in the Zil-Pn group were those who were previously enrolled in the 
control group of the study 10PN-PD-DIT-032. 
Written  informed  consent,  signed  or  thumb  printed  was  to  be  obtained  from  the  parent(s)/LAR(s)  of 
the subject. 
Where parent(s)/LAR(s) were illiterate, the consent form was to be countersigned by a witness. 
The  sample  size  was  contingent  on  the  number  of  Nigerian  subjects  who  received  three  doses  of 
pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-032  (110521),  i.e.  77  planned  subjects. 
Assuming  that  around  20%  of  these  subjects  might  not  enter  this  study,  one  could  consider  that 
approximately 60 subjects would receive the booster dose of study vaccine. 
• 
Treatments 
Both  groups  received  the  same  vaccines  in  this  study.  The  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  was  administered 
intramuscularly  into  the  anterolateral  region  of  the  thigh.  The  DTPa  vaccine  was  injected 
intramuscularly into the left thigh. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety and reactogenicity: 
o  Solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) 
o  Occurrence of each solicited local adverse event (any, grade 3) within 4 days (Day 0-
Day 3) after each vaccine dose. 
o  Occurrence  of  each  solicited  general  adverse  event  (any,  grade  3,  related)  within  4 
days (Day 0-Day 3) after each vaccine dose. 
o  Occurrence  of  unsolicited  adverse  events  within  31  days  (Day  0-Day  30)  after  each 
o  Unsolicited adverse events 
vaccine dose. 
o  Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
o  Occurrence of serious adverse events during the entire study period.

  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
• 
Immunogenicity results 
Immunogenicity  analysis  was  performed  on  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  antibody  persistence  or  on  the 
ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  according  to  the  objective.  Since,  in  any  group,  the  percentage  of 
vaccinated  subjects  with  serological  data  excluded  from  the  ATP  cohort  for  persistence  and  for 
immunogenicity  was  less  than  5%,  a  second  analysis  based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort  was  not 
performed. 
The  immune  responses  measured  by  22F-inhibition  ELISA  results  one  month  after  completion  of  the 
primary  vaccination  course,  prior  to  and  one  month  after  the  booster  dose  (Pn-Pn  group)  or  prior  to 
dose I and one month after dose II (Zil-Pn group) are detailed in Tables 57 and 58.

One month after booster vaccination: 
o  For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, all subjects in the Pn-Pn group had antibody 
concentrations  ≥0.2  µg/mL  except  for  serotypes  6B,  9V  and  23F  (98.5%  of  subjects  had 
antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL for these three serotypes) (Table 57). 
o  For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations 
≥0.2 µg/mL was 80.6% for 6A and 85.1% for 19A. 
o  All subjects had measurable anti-protein D antibody concentrations (≥100 EL.U/mL). 
o  Robust  increases  in  antibody  GMCs  were  observed  from  pre-  to  post-booster  for  all  vaccine 
pneumococcal serotypes. 
One month after the completion of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination: 
o  For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, all subjects in the Zil-Pn group had antibody 
concentrations  ≥0.2  µg/mL  except  for  serotypes  6B  (82.9%  of  subjects),  19F  (97.1%  of 
subjects) and 23F (88.6% of subjects) (Table 57). 
o  For cross-reactive serotypes the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations 
≥0.2 µg/mL was 51.4% for 6A and 88.6% for 19A.

o  94.3%  of  the  subjects  had  measurable  anti-protein  D  antibody  concentrations  (≥100 
EL.U/mL). 
o  Robust increases in antibody GMCs were observed from pre- vaccination to post 2-dose catch-
up vaccination for all vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. 
The OPA results, one month after completion of the primary vaccination course, and one month after 
the booster dose (Pn-Pn group) or one month after dose II (Zil-Pn group) are detailed in Tables 61 and 
62. 
One month after the booster vaccination 
o  For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes at least 94.0% of subjects in the Pn-Pn group 
had opsonophagocytic titres ≥8 (Table 61). 
o  For  cross-reactive  serotypes  6A  and  19A,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with 
opsonophagocytic titres ≥8 was 82.0% and 77.3%, respectively. 
One month after the completion of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination  
o  For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes at least 91.4% of subjects in the Zil-Pn group 
had opsonophagocytic titres ≥8 except for serotypes 6B (77.4% of subjects) and 19F (85.3% 
of subjects) (Table 61). 
o  For  cross-reactive  serotypes  6A  and  19A,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with 
opsonophagocytic titres ≥8 was 82.4% and 85.7%, respectively.

Assessor’s comment: The responses in the 2-dose catch-up group were in some cases lower than the 
post-dose 3 responses in the primed group (e.g. ELISA results for serotypes 5 and 6B). The study was 
not  designed  or  powered  for  formal  comparisons  between  the  groups,  and  larger  studies  with  that 
objective were assessed during the approval procedure for Synflorix. The responses to a single booster 
dose  were  generally  higher  compared  to  the  2-dose  catch-up  groups,  not  unexpectedly.  Considering 
the high response rate in terms of percentage of subjects achieving ≥0.2 µg/mL, and the similarity of 
these rates to those reported in previous studies, the immunogenicity results of this study do not raise 
further concern that would result in SPC changes.  
•  Safety results (summary) 
Solicited local adverse events: 
o 
In the Pn-Pn group, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event during 
the  4-day  post-booster  vaccination  period  reported  in  36.8%  of  subjects  who  received  the 
10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine.  Swelling  at  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  administration  site  was  the  only  grade  3 
solicited local adverse event reported (2.9% of subjects). 
o  A large swelling reaction was reported for one subject in the Pn-Pn group at the 10-Pn-PD-DiT 
injection  site  on  Day  1  following  booster  vaccination.  The  swelling  was  at  maximum  60  mm 
diameter,  not  involving  an  adjacent  joint,  and  resolved  without  sequelae  within  2  days  after 
onset. 
In the Zil-Pn group, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event during 
the 4-day post-vaccination period (30.6% following dose 1 and 13.9% following dose 2 at the 
10Pn-PD-DiT administration site). Grade 3 swelling and redness were reported for one subject 
after dose 1 of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. 
o 
Solicited general adverse events: 
o 
o 
In  the  Pn-Pn  group,  fever  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event 
during  the  4-day  post-booster  vaccination  period  (11.8%  of  subjects).  There  were  no  reports 
of grade 3 solicited general adverse events. 
In  the  Zil-Pn  group,  fever  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event 
during the 4-day post-vaccination period (4.2% of doses; 8.3% of subjects). For one subject, 
grade 3 fever (axillary temperature > 39.5 °C) was reported following the first dose of 10Pn-
PD-DiT  co-administered  with  DTPa  and  this  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally 
related to vaccination. 
Unsolicited adverse events: 
o 
o 
In  the  Pn-Pn  group,  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  within  the  31-day  post-
vaccination  period,  classified  by  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred 
Term  was  reported  for  45.6%  of  subjects.  A  grade  3  unsolicited  adverse  event 
(drowning) that also was a serious adverse event, was reported for one subject. None 
of the reported adverse events were assessed by the investigator to be causally related 
to vaccination. 
In  the  Zil-Pn  group,  for  31.9%  of  doses  (50.0%  of  subjects),  at  least  one  unsolicited 
adverse event within the 31-day post-vaccination period, classified by MedDRA Primary 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term was reported. None of them were grade 3 or 
were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

Serious adverse events: 
o 
In the Pn-Pn group, one fatal event (drowning) was reported for one out of 68 subjects 
during  the  entire  study  period.  This  event  was  considered  by  the  investigator  as  not 
causally related to vaccination. No non-fatal SAEs were reported in this group.  
o  No SAE was reported for subjects in the Zil-Pn group. 
Withdrawals due to serious adverse events: 
o  One subject in the Pn-Pn group died due to drowning during the study period. 
Assessor’s comment: The frequency of adverse events, solicited and unsolicited, do not cause further 
safety concern compared to previously reported safety results.  
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The current study, which was a booster and catch-up study in Nigerian children 15-21 months of age, 
does  not  cause  further  concern  regarding  immunogenicity  or  safety  results.  Thus,  the  procedure  is 
considered fulfilled and no further regulatory action is required.

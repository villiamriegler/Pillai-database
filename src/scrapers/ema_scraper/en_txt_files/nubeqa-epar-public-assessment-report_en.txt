2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Darolutamide is intended for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate 
cancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (prostate specific antigen doubling 
time (PSADT) of ≤ 10 months and PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/mL). 
While most of the early-stage prostate cancer is curable, a subset of men will progress with biochemical 
recurrence. Prostate cancer becomes a potentially fatal metastatic disease by progressing first to non-
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), defined as prostate cancer that progresses despite 
castrate levels of testosterone while on treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analogue 
(LHRHa), or following bilateral orchiectomy. Signs of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
include rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, which represents chemical progression before 
radiologically detectable metastases. Non-metastatic CRPC patients with PSA doubling time ≤ 10 months 
(PSADT; the estimated time required for the PSA level to double) have a high-risk of developing metastases. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Prostate cancer is the 4th most common cancer worldwide, affecting 7.1% of the population, and the 2nd 
most common cancer in men, affecting 15% of all men1,2. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer mortality in 
men in Europe. In 2018, the estimated number of prostate cancer-related deaths in Europe was 107,0003.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Non-metastatic CRPC is defined as CRPC in a man with castrate levels of testosterone in the absence of 
imaged metastases. Approximately 30% of patients with nmCRPC will develop bone metastases within 
2 years, with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 4 years4. Bone pain, skeletal-related events, 
such as spinal cord compression, symptomatic fracture, and surgery or radiotherapy to bone requiring 
supportive care measures (bone-targeting agents, vertebroplasty, radiofrequency ablation) are serious 
complications of advanced prostate cancer and major causes of morbidity and increased mortality5,6.

Among men with nmCRPC, a shorter PSA doubling time (PSADT) is associated with a shorter time to 
metastasis and death. Patients with a PSADT of ≤10 months and an increasing PSA level are considered at 
high risk of developing metastatic disease7,8,9. 
The delay of metastases and the associated morbidity for as long as possible is the goal of therapy for men 
with nmCRPC. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Despite initial responses of 80-90%, nearly all men develop progressive disease following ADT, referred to as 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)10.  
CRPC remains mainly driven by the AR signalling pathway and high-level AR expression commonly occurs in 
CRPC11,12. Until recently there were no medicinal products approved for the treatment of nmCRPC at high risk 
of  developing  metastasis  and  the  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN)  guideline  recommended 
first-generation antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide), second-generation novel hormonal 
therapies  (enzalutamide,  abiraterone),  ketoconazole,  corticosteroids  or  diethylstilbestrol  as  second-line 
hormonal therapies13 while the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines refers to ADT and watchful 
waiting 14.  However,  recently  two  nonsteroidal  anti-androgens,  apalutamide  and  enzalutamide  have  been 
approved  for treatment  of  nmCRPC  at  high  risk  of  developing  metastases  in  EU15,16.  Available data showed 
that enzalutamide (PROSPER trial) and apalutamide (SPARTAN trial), respectively, improved metastasis-free 
survival  (MFS)  compared  to  placebo  among  patients  continuing  ADT  for  nmCRPC 17, 18.  The  AR  inhibitors 
enzalutamide and apalutamide were shown to provide significant MFS benefit to nmCRPC patients with PSADT 
of 10 months or less, but resulted in increased risk of toxicities including seizures, falls, fractures, hypertension, 
weight loss, cognitive disorders, fatigue and rash when used along with ADT18,19.

Darolutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding, AR nuclear translocation, and AR mediated 
transcription. Darolutamide treatment decreases prostate tumour cell proliferation leading to potent 
antitumour activity. (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The recommended indication is: Nubeqa is indicated for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (see 
SmPC sections 4.1 and 5.1). 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a specialist physician experienced in treatment of prostate 
cancer. 
The recommended dose is 600 mg darolutamide (two tablets of 300 mg) taken twice daily, equivalent to a 
total daily dose of 1200 mg. 
Medical castration with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue should be continued 
during treatment of patients not surgically castrated. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was because there were available therapies 
(apalutamide and enzalutamide) with positive benefit/risk balance for the treatment of patients with non-
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic 
disease and thus medical need could not be considered unmet. Although it is considered valuable having 
additional therapeutic options for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease, this was not considered 
sufficient to trigger accelerated assessment.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of darolutamide is N-{(2S)-1-[3-(3-chloro-4-cyanophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]propan -2-
yl}-5-(1-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula C19H19ClN6O2. It 
has a relative molecular mass of 398.85 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of darolutamide was elucidated by a combination of IR, Raman UV/VIS, 1H-NMR, 13C-
NMR and mass spectroscopy. An analysis of the solid state properties including possible polymorphs and a 
discussion of the stability of the polymorphic form in the active substance was provided. 
The active substance is a white to greyish- or yellowish-white powder which his not hygroscopic. The active 
substance solubility is very low; darolutamide is practically insoluble in water and in the pH range from 1.0 to 
6.5, as well as in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) pH 6.5; very slightly soluble in FaSSIF pH 
5.0. 
Darolutamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. The configurations are (S, 
S)-darolutamide and (S, R)-darolutamide. Darolutamide milled active substance is a mixture of 
diastereomers (S, S)-darolutamide and (S, R)-darolutamide. These were consistently obtained through the 
synthesis pathway, as a 1:1 mixture. The diastereomeric ratio of all darolutamide milled active substance 
batches used in clinical studies has been consistent and is controlled routinely in the active substance 
specification by a chiral HPLC test. In vivo, the diastereomers interconvert via the metabolite keto-
darolutamide.  
Darolutamide exhibits polymorphism. Form I is the thermodynamically stable polymorph at ambient 
conditions and the active substance manufacturing process is designed to produce crystal form I. The identity 
of crystal form I is controlled routinely in the active substance specification by X-Ray powder diffraction 
(XRPD) test. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Darolutamide is synthesized in six main steps (four chemical transformations, crystallization and physical 
treatment by milling) using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. Adequate detailed 
description of the active substance synthesis process was provided in the dossier.  
The choice of starting materials has been justified in line with the requirements of ICH Q11 guideline. The 
quantities of reagents described in the manufacturing process are specified for a typical batch size and can be 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 14/137 
  
  
  
 
 
adapted to the size of the apparatus, etc. provided the stoichiometric ratio of the reaction components 
remains constant.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies such 
as One Variable at a Time (OVAT) studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessments and design of 
experiment (DOE) studies. Design Spaces (DSp), Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs) and Normal Operating 
Ranges (NORs) are set in the different steps of the commercial active substance manufacturing process.  
During development, the process parameters were evaluated by risk assessment and the process parameters 
with potential influence on the quality attributes of darolutamide were identified and investigated by OVAT 
studies or by performing multivariate studies (DoE). During the marketing authorisation application (MAA) 
procedure a major objection was raised relating to a significant number of PARs which required further 
justification and/or supporting data and to discrepancies between the PARs described in the development 
(3.2.S.2.6) and manufacturing sections (3.2.S.2.2) of the dossier. In responses the applicant provided 
additional data from multivariate DoE studies where the effects of all potentially interacting process 
parameters were investigated. The studies conducted in each step were described. The parameters used for 
the results interpretation in the different studies have been justified. In addition, the potential interaction 
between parameters and scalability issues have also been considered.  
Based on those studies Design Spaces and multiple PARs were defined in various process steps. Adequate in-
process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Critical process parameters that impact the 
active substance properties have been described, in particular the reaction conditions that could lead to 
impurities present in the final active substance. Specifications used for the controls of the intermediates have 
been provided, as well as batch results.  
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed Design Spaces and PARs. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities, including potentially genotoxic 
impurities, were well discussed with regards to their origin and potential carryover to the active substance.  
The active substance is packaged in transparent low density polyethylene (PE) foil which complies with Ph. 
Eur. chapter 3.1.4 and EC 10/2011 as amended. The secondary packaging is a PE bag placed in a closed 
container (e.g. fibre drum). 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), organic 
impurities (HPLC), diastereomeric ratio (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), residual 
solvents (HSGC),  particle size distribution (laser diffraction), polymorphism (XRPD), microbiological 
impurities (Ph. Eur.) and palladium (ICP-OES). 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 15/137 
  
  
  
 
The limits for the control of impurities are in line with the batch results. Impurities present at higher than the 
qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and 
appropriate specifications have been set. The impurity keto-darolutamide is above the qualification limit 
according ICH Q3A; nevertheless, since it is also a major human and animal metabolite of the active 
substance it can be considered qualified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from four commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 production batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: assay, impurities, loss on drying, diastereomeric ratio, particle size 
distribution and polymorphism. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and were similar between the batches, with the exception 
of out of specification results observed for the particle size distribution for some of the batches. Further 
investigation was performed confirming that the out of specifications results obtained were explained by an 
agglomeration of the particles in the small packaging used for the storage of the active substance during the 
stability study. No change in the particle size distribution was observed in the bulk packaging. 
No trends are observed for the other parameters tested, neither for impurities nor the diastereomeric ratio. 
The polymorphic form of the active substance is maintained throughout the storage period. 
Results from stress-tested conditions (thermal, humidity, oxidative, hydrolytic alkaline and hydrolytic acidic) 
were also provide in order to investigate the formation of potential degradation products. The samples were 
tested for assay, specified impurities and unknown impurities. The observed unknown degradation products 
are sufficiently separated from the active substance peak or peak of specified organic impurity; the peak of 
the active substance did not show any sign of co-elution with the degradation products. 
A photostability study was performed according to ICH Q1B. No significant degradation was observed on the 
solid substance, the assay showed no significant decrease. However, some degradation was observed when 
the active substance was in solution. It was concluded that no special protection from light is necessary 
during the production or handling of the solid active substance, however the active substance solutions used 
in the HPLC assay and impurities analysis should be protected from light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months without any special storage 
conditions in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white to off-white, oval, film-coated tablets, marked ‘BAYER’ on one side 
and ‘300’ on the other side, packed in a blister. The dimensions of the tablets are 16 mm length, 8 mm width, 
5 mm thickness and the tablet weight is 618.0 mg. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
A  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  approach  was  applied  in  the  development  of  the  formulation  and  manufacturing 
process  in  line  with  the  principles  of  ICH  Q8.  The  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  defined  as  an 
immediate  release  tablet,  film-coated  to  facilitate  swallowing  and  protect  from  direct  contact  with  the  drug 
substance,  that  meets  pharmacopoeial  and  other  relevant  quality  standards  (e.g.  ICH),  and  is  packaged  to 
provide suitable protection of the product.  
The critical quality attributes were identified. Additional quality attributes of the granules and/or tablet cores, 
important for formulation and process development were also identified.  
The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and 
design of experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. An initial 
risk analysis was performed using the Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) method to define critical process 
steps and process parameters of each manufacturing step that may have an influence on the critical quality 
attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and 
manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development, process design and scale-
up studies.  
Several process development studies focusing on the identified risks were performed on laboratory, pilot and 
commercial  scale  batches.  Subsequently,  an  intermediate  risk  analysis  was  conducted,  considering  the 
increased process and product understanding. Critical manufacturing steps and material/process parameters 
were  identified.  The  manufacturing  process  development  investigated  several  ranges  for  some  of  the 
manufacturing steps, which could interact with each other. Justification for these ranges is supported by the 
development studies, including multivariable studies performed at a laboratory scale.  
An  optimal  control  strategy  was  defined  for  the  finally  identified  as  high-risk  process  parameters  /  material 
attributes so that all possible risks were reduced to an acceptable level. The studies and the analysis performed 
are  comprehensive,  a  good  understanding  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  product  attributes  has  been 
demonstrated.  The  critical  manufacturing  steps,  materials  attributes  and  process  parameters  selected  are 
justified. The studies performed and results obtained demonstrate that other parameters are less critical, within 
the ranges evaluated. There are three manufacturing steps in which more than one process parameter range 
is specified. These process parameter ranges are classified as Design Spaces (DSp), PARs or NORs.   
The final formulation selected is in accordance with the properties of the active substance and the QTPP. The 
choice  of  the  excipients  has  been  adequately  justified,  in  terms  of  the  qualitative  and  the  quantitative 
composition. The active substance contained in the finished product is a mixture of two diastereomers. The 
proportion was demonstrated not to be affected by the finished product manufacturing process and to remain 
constant during the shelf life of the product. Similarly, the same polymorphic form of the active substance is 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 17/137 
  
  
  
 
used  in  the  manufacturing  process  and  is  contained  in  the  finished  product.  Milled  active  substance,  with  a 
controlled particle size, is used in the composition of the finished product, as the particle size can impact the 
dissolution of the tablets.  
The  active  substance  is  considered  to  be  a  BCS  class  2  active  substance,  having  a  low  solubility  and  high 
permeability.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the  proposed  dissolution  method  has  been  demonstrated  and 
considered to be acceptable. 
During development, an oral solution and an intravenous solution were used in a phase I mass balance, PK, 
biotransformation and bioavailability study. A capsule formulation was used in phase I and phase II clinical 
studies. An uncoated tablet formulation was developed and used in a further phase I study. Film coated 
tablets were developed for phase III and the commercial phase. The core composition of the uncoated tablet 
and the final tablet are similar, with the exception of the magnesium stearate concentration  , compensated 
by amounts of lactose monohydrate and calcium hydrogen phosphate. For the clinical studies a blue coating 
film was used. For the commercial tablet the blue coat was replaced by a white coat. Similarity of exposure 
between the capsule and the uncoated tablet was demonstrated in a phase I bioavailability study at 600 mg 
dose. The application of the blue film was demonstrated to have no relevant effect on dissolution and the 
change of the film from blue to white was demonstrated to result in similar dissolution profiles. 
The primary packaging is PVC/Aluminium foil blister strips containing 16 film coated tablets each. The material 
complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of a number of steps including; mixing, granulation, drying of granules, 
mixing and lubrication, tablet compression and film-coating. The manufacturing process is considered to be a 
standard process and is justified by the properties of the active substance and the target profile of the drug 
product.  
A detailed narrative description of the manufacturing process is provided in the dossier. The controls of the 
critical steps were presented. There are three manufacturing steps in which more than one process parameter 
range is specified. These process parameter ranges are classified as Design Spaces (DSp), PARs or NORs.   
The design spaces have been developed at lab/pilot scale. The extrapolation of the laboratory scale 
observations to pilot scale has been justified and the extrapolation to production scale batches is based on 
evaluation of the observations made on the batches manufactured over time. The ranges used in the 
description of the finished product manufacturing process are justified by the studies performed during the 
pharmaceutical development. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch 
analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design space and PARs. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form and are justified by the development studies performed. 
A holding time  is specified for the bulk product packed in double polyethylene bag placed in tightly closed tin 
containers. This is considered acceptable, as holding time study results were provided to support the proposed 
period. The applicant has confirmed that the expiration period of production batches will be set considering the 
principle defined in the Note for Guidance on start of shelf-life of the finished dosage form. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 18/137 
  
  
  
 
Production scale batches have been manufactured. As the finished product manufacturing process is a standard 
process, the proposal to perform the validation of the manufacturing process at maximum commercial scale on 
three batches on each granulation lines before the release of the batches and the controls planned during this 
exercise are acceptable.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance, 
identity  (HPLC,  UV/VIS),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  degradation  products 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbial purity (Ph. Eur).  
The  finished  product is  released  on  the  market based  on the  release  specifications,  through  traditional  final 
product  release  testing.  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The limits proposed for the control of the degradation products were tightened in response to questions raised 
during  the  MAA  procedure.  The  limit  for  unspecified  degradation  products  has  been  set  in  line  with  the 
requirements of ICH Q3B. The limit proposed for total impurities is in line with the batch results found in the 
stability studies. 
The  limit  for  the  control  of  the  dissolution  was  tightened  in  response  to  questions  raised  during  the  MAA 
procedure. This acceptance criteria is in line with the batch results and is considered acceptable.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on four 
commercial finished product batches using a validated method was provided, demonstrating that each 
relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three finished product batches. The results were similar between the 
batches  and  compliant  with  the  acceptance  criteria  in  the  finished  product  specification.  In  addition,  batch 
results  from  representative  batches  used  in  technical,  clinical  and/or  stability  studies  are  provided  in  the 
documentation. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing (Al/PVC blisters).  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution  and  microbial  purity.  The 
analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  The  results  obtained  under  long-term,  intermediate  and 
accelerated  stability  conditions  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product  is  stable.  No  particular  trend  was 
observed.  As  there  were  no  significant  changes  observed  during  the  period  of  the  stability  study,  an 
extrapolation of 12 months is possible, according to the ICH Q1E guideline.  
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 19/137 
  
  
  
 
In addition to the data from the primary stability studies, supportive stability data from batches used in clinical 
trials, at long-term and accelerated conditions, were provided. As these batches were packaged in HDPE bottles 
they were not considered for setting the product shelf-life.  
The stability of the tablets in bulk has been studied. The 12-months bulk stability data for two batches at long-
term conditions were adequate to support the proposed bulk holding time.  
The results obtained in additional studies (i.e. open container, photostability studies) confirm the stability of 
the product. No changes in any of the tested parameters indicating any light sensitivity of the product were 
observed. 
A forced degradation study of the finished product was carried out to get information on the degradation of the 
active substance darolutamide in the formulation.  
Post-approval stability commitments to continue the primary stability studies up to 36 months and to perform 
stability studies on the first three commercial scale batches up to at least 36 months at long-term and 6 months 
at accelerated storage conditions are provided. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years (36 months) when stored in the 
commercial packaging with no special storage conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and 
their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the 
active substance and finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress and to 
investigate the risk of presence of nitrosamine in their medicinal products, the CHMP recommends the 
following points for investigation: 
• 
It is recommended that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in Nubeqa (darolutamide) is conducted within six months of the marketing authorisation. 
In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation, 
confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within 
a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine 
impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology non-clinical data for darolutamide included a description of in vitro activity and mechanism 
of action. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacology data derived from different human prostate cancer models 
implanted on mice were provided. The secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacological profile of 
darolutamide and, in selected cases, (S,R)-darolutamide, (S,S)-darolutamide, and keto-darolutamide, was 
assessed in various in vitro and/or in vivo (rat, dog; single dose) studies. Vital organ functions including 
central nervous system, cardiovascular system (including ECG) and respiratory system as well as on 
supplementary organ systems (gastrointestinal tract) were investigated. 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies exploring the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) 
characteristics and the toxicokinetic profile of darolutamide were provided. 
The toxicological program included studies to investigate the systemic toxicity and exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effects after repeated administration to rats and dogs as well as studies addressing a 
potential genotoxicity and phototoxicity of darolutamide.

Noteworthy findings 
• 
•  When administrated with testosterone 
propionate, both ORM-15674 and ORM-
15341 showed antagonistic features by 
decreasing significantly and dose-
dependently the relative mass of the ventral 
prostate and the relative mass of seminal 
vesicles compared to mere testosterone 
dosing. 
Relative weight of ventral prostate was 
reduced by 50, 78 and 110% following oral, 
daily treatment with 10, 30 and 100mg/kg 
of darolutamide, in comparison to the 
3mg/kg, s.c, daily TP-stimulated group. 
Relative weight of seminal vesicles was 
reduced by 33, 63 and 88% following oral, 
daily treatment with 10, 30 and 100mg/kg 
of darolutamide, in comparison to the 
3mg/kg, s.c, daily TP-stimulated group. 
Xenografted tumours were observed to 
grow significantly more slowly in mice 
treated for 37 days with 50mg/kg of 
darolutamide, orally, once daily, compared 
to castrated untreated mice.  
•  When treating mice twice daily with 
• 
• 
50mg/kg darolutamide for 37 days, tumour 
regression was observed, compared to 
castrated untreated mice. The tumour 
regression was higher than once daily 
treatment.  
• 
• 
VCaP cells were inoculated into the prostate 
of nude intact male mice 
Both ORM-15674 and ORM-16678 had no 
effects on the body weights of the mice 
during the study period. 
•  ORM-15674 significantly decreased the 
volume of VCaP tumours. No significant 
decrease was observed with ORM-16678. 
No significant changes in tumour weights of 
VCaP tumours were observed for both ORM-
15674 and ORM-16678. 
• 
•  ORM-16678 at 20mg/kg/day increased the 
relative weight of testis significantly as well 
as ORM-15674 at 50mg/kg/twice daily. 
•  ORM-15674 at 50mg/kg/twice daily 
significantly decreased the relative weight 
of kidney. 
• 
•  ORM-15674 and ORM-16678 significantly 
decreased the serum PSA levels from day 
42/44 of the study period. 
No significant changes in serum 
testosterone levels were observed in 
treatment groups compared to vehicle 
group. A trend of increased serum 
testosterone levels could be detected with 
ORM-16678.

Table 3: Summary of secondary pharmacodynamics studies 
• 
VCaP cells were inoculated into the prostate 
of castrated mice. 
•  ORM-15674 had no significant effects on 
the tumour weights of the mice (high 
variation in the individual tumour size) but 
a clear dose-dependent trend of inhibition 
of tumour growth was detected.   
•  ORM-15674 with tested doses had no 
effects on the tumour volumes, on the body 
weights, on liver, lung, spleen or kidney 
weights. 
•  ORM-15674 inhibited mean relative PSA 
growth with all doses compared to the 
vehicle. 
•  ORM-15674 with the doses 50 and 
100mg/kg twice daily showed significant 
difference in serum PSA levels compared to 
control group. 
•  ORM-15674 showed a dose-dependent 
• 
• 
• 
trend to inhibit the growth of the orthotopic 
VCaP tumours in the castration-resistant 
prostate cancer model. 
The lowest dose of 25 mg/kg bid maximally 
suppressed PSA in mice. 
Based on a free Darolutamide fraction of 
8.0% in human plasma these efficacious 
exposures correspond to unbound AUC(0-
24) at steady state of 4610 and 5408 
ng·h/mL, respectively.  
These values are similar to the mean 
unbound AUC (0-24) in mice after a dose of 
25 mg/kg bid, which showed to be 
maximally efficacious for suppressing PSA.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  in  line  with  ICH  S7A  and  S7B  guidelines.  Most  of  them  were 
performed according to GLP, except the in vitro studies (electrophysiology). 
Central Nervous System 
Evaluation of the potential effects on CNS was done during the 4-week toxicity study in rats. Darolutamide 
was given at 100, 300, or 1000 mg/Kg/day by oral gavage. No effects were reported, except a reduced 
motor activity in males and females, and reduced alertness in males at ≥300 mg/Kg/day at week 3. The 
mean maximum concentrations (Cmax) values of darolutamide and keto-darolutamide at the highest dose of 
1000 mg/kg/day at Day 1 were 22100 and 23500 ng/mL in males and 29000 and 25000 ng/mL in females, 
respectively. 
Respiratory system 
Respiratory parameters were evaluated by plethymosgraphy method after single dose (oral gavage) in rats. 
The animals were dosed with darolutamide at 100, 300, or 1000 mg/Kg, and respiratory rate, tidal volume and 
respiratory minute volume were recorded. Decreased tidal volumes (-32% at 5 h and -24% at 24 h, compared 
EMA/84124/2020

to vehicle) and respiratory minute volume (-25% at 5 h and 18% at 24 h, compared to vehicle) in 1000 mg/kg 
dosed animals, at 5 and 24 h post-dose, were considered incidental and not treatment-related. 
Gastrointestinal effects 
The charcoal propulsion test was used to evaluate the potential effects of darolutamide (30, 100, 300 and 
1000 mg/Kg) on intestinal motility and gastric emptying. No effect was reported up to the highest dose level 
tested, administered as a suspension. Insoluble test article was found in the intestines in animals given at 
≥300 mg/Kg. 
Cardiovascular effects 
In the in vitro automated patch clamp assay (non-GLP), darolutamide showed a weakly inhibition against hERG. 
Darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide, (S,S)-darolutamide, or keto-darolutamide were tested at the concentrations 
of 1, 3, 10 and 30 µM. The IC50 values reported for the four test compounds were 87.9, 11.5, 30.2, and 8.0 
µM, respectively. Darolutamide blocked the hERG current by 34.5% at the highest dose (30µM).  
In vitro, darolutamide dose-dependently inhibited the L-type calcium channel (non-GLP assay). The IC50 
values obtained were 37.4, 42.5, 46.6 and 22.5 µM, respectively for darolutamide, (S,R)-darolutamide, 
(S,S)-darolutamide, and keto-darolutamide. These values were compared to those obtained with 
bicalutamide and calcium channel blockers (verapamil and dihydropyridine), 12.9, 4.1 and 0.6 µM, 
respectively.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The bioanalysis methods appear to be adequately characterized and validated for use in the GLP studies. 
Absorption 
In vivo single dose PK 
After single oral administration of darolutamide, the absorption was complete, and the absolute bioavailability 
was high in rats (100%). The bioavailability in dogs was low in fasted (12.6%) and in fed state (16.3%). The 
slightly higher value in fed state was attributed to a food effect. Darolutamide exposure in terms of AUC(0-24) 
increased less than dose-proportionally in both species in the dose range tested, especially from mid to high 
dose, supporting the assumption of solubility-limited absorption from suspensions. 
After IV administration of darolutamide the AUC ratio of keto-darolutamide to darolutamide amounted to 1:1 
in both species. The plasma clearance (CLP) of darolutamide was low in male rats with 0.46 L/(h·kg) and the 
apparent CL with 0.19 L/(h·kg) in dogs. In rats whole blood clearance (CLB) was 0.71 L/(h·kg) and in dogs the 
apparent CLB was 0.39 L/(h·kg) and thus, 21 and 16% of the corresponding liver blood flow (rat: 4.2 L/(h·kg), 
dog: 2.1 L/(h·kg)). 
The CLp of the two diastereomers in rats was in the same range (0.41 – 0.53 L/(h·kg)), whereas in dogs the 
apparent CLp of (S,R)-darolutamide with 0.11 L/(h·kg) was much lower as compared to (S,S)-darolutamide 
(0.70  L/(h·kg)  indicating  faster  elimination  of  (S,S)-darolutamide.  The  volume  of  distribution  (Vss)  of 
darolutamide  was  high  in  rats  with  1.16  L/kg  and  in  dogs  with  the  apparent  Vss  of  1.8  L/kg.  The  plasma 
elimination half-lives were long in rat, dog (apparent) and human (t1/2: 4, 7 and 12 hours, respectively). 
In vivo repeated dose PK 
In male mice, at a daily oral dosing of 25, 50, 100 mg/kg/day for 7 days the apparent steady state exposure 
in  terms  of  AUC(0-24)  and  Cmax  increased  from  the  low  to  the  high  dose  less  than  dose-proportional. The 
diastereoisomeric ratio at steady state for AUC (0-24) was on average 0.8:0.2. The metabolite/parent ratio for 
AUC (0-24) increased with dose from 2.2-fold to 3.4-fold. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 29/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In rats, at day 1 and day 6, there were no changes in terms of AUC(0-24) and Cmax between 1 and 6 days. 
After 4 weeks of treatment female rats were more exposed than male rats. The apparent steady state exposure 
in terms of AUC(0-24) and Cmax increased from the low to the high dose less than dose-proportional in both 
sexes. 
At day 28, Cmax and AUC (0-24) decreased compared to day 1. The diastereoisomeric ratio at steady state for 
AUC(0-24) was on average 0.4:0.6. The metabolite/parent ratio for AUC(0-24) was between 1.2 and 1.4 fold 
at day 6 and day 28, respectively. 
In  male  dogs,  no  difference  between  day  1  and  day  28  in  terms  of  AUC  and  Cmax  was  seen.  The 
diastereoisomeric ratio at steady state for AUC(0-24) on day 28 was 0.9:0.1. The metabolite/parent ratio for 
AUC(0-24)  amounted  dose-independently  to  0.7.  In  plasma  of  dogs  (S,R)-darolutamide  prevailed  with  9:1 
whereas in humans the ratio was 1:6 under steady state conditions.  
Distribution 
Radio-HPLC analysis of plasma, human serum albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein and buffer incubated under the 
experimental conditions used for plasma protein binding and blood cell partitioning investigations demonstrated 
that [14C]-ORM-15674 (darolutamide) was stable. Moreover, ORM-15674 and ORM-15341 (active metabolite) 
were stable in plasma from all species, human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. 
There was little difference in binding of ORM-16497 ((S,R)-darolutamide) to the plasma proteins of rat, dog, 
monkey and human compared with binding of ORM-16555 ((S,S)-Darolutamide) in the same species. 
Tissue distribution studies in mice and rats showed the same results in excretory organs, prostate and brain. 
In mice, darolutamide and keto-darolutamide and in rats total radioactivity exhibited low penetration into brain 
(brain/plasma ratio of AUC(0-24) < 0.05). Brain exposures to darolutamide in terms of AUC(0-24) were 4.5% 
of plasma exposure after single dose in rats and 1.9-3.9% after repeated dose in mice. 
In rats, following oral administration, [14C]-ODM-201 (1:1 mixture of the two diastereomers (S,R) and (S,S))-
related  material  was  absorbed  and  widely  distributed.  All  investigated  tissues  contained  quantifiable 
radioactivity 15 minutes after dose administration. 
Absorption  was  relatively  slow.  Most  tissues  (65%)  contained  highest  measured  concentrations  at  12  hours 
post-dose. 
Elimination  of  drug-related  radioactivity  was  rapid,  with  tissue  concentrations  in  albino  animals  significantly 
lower at 24 hours than at 12 hours.  
By 168 hours only the liver contained quantifiable radioactivity. Blood concentrations were approximately 60% 
of those in plasma suggesting ODM-201 had a higher affinity for the aqueous phase. In partially pigmented 
animals  at  24,  72  and  168  hours,  distribution  was  comparable  to  that  seen  in  albino  animals  although 
concentrations  in  melanin  containing  tissues  (pigmented  skin  and  uveal  tract/retina)  were  higher.  Some 
evidence  of  limited/reversible  binding  to  melanin  containing  tissues.  Biliary  secretion  and  renal  clearance 
contributed to the elimination of [14C]-ODM-201 and/or its radiolabelled metabolites.  Only low levels of drug-
related material penetrated the blood brain and the blood testes barriers. 
In  the  prostate  as  target  tissue  with  0.45  a  10-fold  higher  tissue/plasma  ratio  of  AUC(0-24)  was  observed 
compared to brain. No evidence of irreversible binding was observed.

Metabolism 
In vitro 
The primary human metabolic pathways (oxidation and glucuronidation) were well observed in rodent and dog 
hepatocytes.  There  was  no  unique  human  metabolite.  The  major  differences  between  animal  and  human 
metabolism were: 
- Metabolism in human hepatocytes was slower than metabolism in animals. 
- The capacity to convert ORM-15341 (active metabolite) to ORM-16555 ((S,S)-Darolutamide)  was higher in 
human than it was in rats and dogs. 
- ORM-16497 ((S,R)-darolutamide)) was the predominant metabolite for dogs but for human the predominant 
metabolite was ORM-16555 ((S,S)-darolutamide). 
In human liver hepatocytes, the main enzymes involved in the interconversion between the two diastereomers 
are CYP450, CBR, ADH, and AKR1C3. 
In the human liver microsomes, ODM-201 inhibits weakly CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 with an IC50<100 µM. 
There  was  a  slight  tendency  to  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8  and  CYP3A4  leading  to  an 
IC50>100 µM. No inhibition was observed for CYP2E1. 
In vivo 
Keto-darolutamide  was  the  only  major  circulating  metabolite  in  mouse,  rat,  dog  and  human  plasma.  This 
metabolite  had  a  similar  pharmacological  activity  compared  to  darolutamide  (and  to  both  diastereomers). 
Exposure of darolutamide in terms of percentages AUC amounted to 49.9% in rats and to 28.6% in man. After 
repeated oral administration up to 28 days in males, the AUC ratio of keto-darolutamide/darolutamide in rats 
and dogs was 1.2 - 1.4 and 0.7, respectively. After multiple doses in humans, the systemic exposure to the 
metabolite was approximately 2-fold higher than that of darolutamide. 
Excretion 
In rats, radioactivity was excreted mainly via the biliary/faecal route after oral and intravenous administration 
of [14C]darolutamide. Renal excretion contributed to the overall clearance of drug-related radioactivity by about 
30% in intact rats. 
In human, approximately 63% of the administered radioactivity is excreted into urine, another 32% of dose is 
excreted into the faeces (see clinical pharmacokinetics). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity study was submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects) 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Dose Range Finding (DRF) studies in rats 
In an initial 3-day DRF study, no mortality or clinical signs were observed up to the limit dose of 2000 mg/Kg 
in male rats. In a 7-day DRF oral study no signs of toxicity were reported up to 1000 mg/Kg. The last DRF 
study was conducted in rats treated during 14 days at the dose levels of 50, 200 or 800 mg/Kg/day. In this 
EMA/84124/2020

study,  signs  of  the  pharmacodynamic  activity  were  found  in  male  rats  (female  phenotype  of  the  mammary 
glands and secretory reduction in seminal vesicles) treated with darolutamide at the three dose levels. 
4-week toxicity study in rats  
Male and female rats were treated with darolutamide at 100, 300 or 1000 mg/Kg/day (10 M and 10 F) during 
28 days. Treatment was tolerated in all groups, although some clinical findings were reported. As such, excess 
salivation  was  observed  on  the  last  week  of  treatment  in  animals  receiving  the  highest  dose  level  (1000 
mg/Kg/day). In the case of male animals, they presented a dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain and 
lower food consumption at the three dose levels. At necropsy, prostate, epididymis and thymus were affected 
(table below).

26-week toxicity study in rats 
In this study, animals were treated at the same dose levels than the 4-week study, although they were twice 
daily  administered  with  the  aim  of  increasing  the  systemic  exposure  (2x50  (100),  2x150  (300),  and  2x500 
(1000) mg/kg/day). Treatment period was extended for 26 weeks. Two  drug-free recovery groups, one from 
high  dose  and  one  from  control  were  included  to  study  the  potential  reversibility  of  symptoms  during  an 
additional four-week period of time. Some relevant findings were reported in all treated male groups, especially 
on male gonads. At necropsy, prostate, epididymis and testes were especially affected (table below). Minimal 
to slight atrophy of the mammary gland of male rats and minimal increase in vacuolation of the pars anterior 
of the pituitary gland was also present. No effects were reported in female animals. The original report of the 
study mentions a possible reduced activity clinically at 300 and 1000 mg/Kg/day in males and females. Given 
the  findings  observed  in  male  animals,  no  no-observed-effect  level  (NOEL)  was  obtained.  According  to  the 
study report, the NOAEL for female animals were 1000 mg/kg/day.

Repeat dose toxicity studies in non-rodents 
DRF studies in dogs 
An initial study consisting in an escalating dose phase (from 50 to 1000 mg/Kg/day for 3 days) and a 
confirmatory phase was performed (1000 mg/Kg/day for a week). A saturation of exposure was observed at 
800 mg/Kg/day, so this dose level was selected for the 28-day repeated dose. In another DRF study 
conducted in dogs, escalating doses from 200 to 1000 mg/Kg/day were administered for two weeks. Dose 
level of 400 mg/Kg/day was well tolerated and selected for the 13-week study. 
4-week toxicity study in dogs 
Animals received darolutamide at the dose levels of 50, 200 or 800 mg/Kg/day. After four weeks of treatment, 
a slight body weight loss associated with lower food consumption was observed. At necropsy, lower prostate 
weights, diffuse atrophy in prostate, oligospermia and vacuolation of the epididymal epithelium (table below) 
were reported.

In this study, the maximum dose level was 2x200mg/Kg/day, given that no increase in exposure was observed 
at  higher  dose  levels.  A  slight  mean  body  weight  loss  in  females  and  white-coloured  faeces  indicating  the 
presence  of  darolutamide  in  faeces  were  reported  at  400  mg/Kg/day.  At  necropsy,  prostatic  atrophy,  lower 
weight of epididymides and decreased tubular diameter and epithelial atrophy were found (table below). These 
findings were reported as reversible, as they were minimal at the end of the 4-week recovery period.

39-week toxicity study in dogs 
Dose levels were the same than those used in the 13-week repeated dose toxicity study, i.e. 2x25, 75x2, 
200x2 mg/Kg/day. Recovery groups were added to the study, which were maintained during an 8-week 
treatment-free period. A lower slight mean body weight gain was observed. Slight decreases in mean red 
blood cell parameters in males of the medium and high dose levels were reported from weeks 13 to 39. At 
necropsy, the prostate and epididymis weight were lower than control with histological correlation (table 
below). Minimal or slight tubular dilatation and tubular degeneration/atrophy was reported with increased 
testis weight.

Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of darolutamide was studied in three GLP tests.  
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 34/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Salmonella/microsome test (Ames): bacterial mutagenicity assay was performed with darolutamide. Two 
independent studies, in five Salmonella typhimurium strains up to 5000 µg/plate (R-9724), in the absence 
and presence of metabolic activation (rat liver S9 mix) were performed. Signs of toxicity to test bacteria and 
precipitation of darolutamide were observed at dose levels of 2500-5000 µg/plate. No evidence of mutagenic 
activity was seen in this study. 
In vitro mammalian cell test: the chromosome aberrations assay in cultured peripheral human lymphocytes 
was conducted with darolutamide in five independent studies. The induction of chromosome aberrations was 
reported in the presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9 fraction) at concentrations ≥200 µg/mL and 
≥240 µg/mL, respectively. These concentrations were non-toxic and the results exceeded the historical 
control data. Darolutamide was positive in this test.  
Combined micronucleus test and Comet assay in the rat: in vivo genotoxicity tests with darolutamide 
consisted in micronucleus test and Comet assay test in rats. In the micronucleus test, no difference in the 
frequency of micronucleated PCEs was observed in the three dose levels tested (100, 500 and 1000 mg/Kg) 
and the control group. In the Comet assay, no DNA damage was observed in the animals received 
darolutamide. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Effects on reproductive organs were seen in the 14-day, 28-day and 13-week rat study and in the 7-day, 28-
day, 13-week and 39-week dog study. In the 14-day rat study reduction of prostate and epididymis weight, 
necropsy of the small seminal vesicles, secretory reduction and female phenotype of the mammary glands were 
observed for all doses. In the 28-day rat study, reduction of prostate and epididymis weight and reduction of 
prostatic secretory were observed at all doses.  
In the 26-week rat study, reduction of prostate, testes and epididymis weight, prostate, seminal vesicle and 
mammary gland atrophy and a diameter reduction of epididymal tubules. 
In the 7-day dog study, decreased prostate weight at a diffuse atrophy in the prostate at 1000mg/kg/day. 
In the 28-day dog study, decreased of the prostate and epididymis weight, reduction of oligospermia in the 
epididymis and a reduction of the vacuolization of the epididymal epithelium in the epididymis at all doses. 
In  the  13-week  dog  study,  decreased  prostate  and  epididymis  weight  and  increased  testes  weight  were 
observed at all doses. At the end of the recovery period there was still a reduction of prostate weight, a minimal 
prostate atrophy and decreased tubular diameter of the epididymis. 
In the 39-week dog study, decreased prostate and epididymis weight and increased testes weight, prostatic 
and epididymal atrophy, changes in the tubular diameter of epididymis, epithelial atrophy and reduced sperm 
content were observed at all doses. Minimal testicular Leydig cell hypertrophy was observed at 2x75 and 2x200 
mg/kg/day. All these symptoms were reversible except the prostate weight. 
Toxicokinetics 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 35/137 
  
  
  
 
All references to the exposure margins compared to humans are based on the mean human 1200 mg/kg/day 
(2x600 mg/kg/day), exposure data: AUC(0-24h) of darolutamide of 57.6 hxµg/mL and Cmax of Darolutamide 
of 3.33 µg/mL.  
The metabolite/parent drug ratio after repeated dose in rats is 1.2.-1.4 and 0.7 in dogs which means that rats 
were more exposed to the metabolite compound and dogs were more exposed to the parent compound. 
Rats exposure to the diastereomers were relatively the same between (S,R) and (S,S)-darolutamide whereas 
the dogs were exposed mostly to (S,R)-Darolutamide (around 90%).  
Local tolerance 
The  intended  route  of  administration  is  oral.  The  gastrointestinal  tract  was  evaluated  in  all  repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in Wistar rats. No indication of local adverse reactions related to the drug. No dedicated local 
tolerance testing was provided (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Both darolutamide and keto-darolutamide absorb light in the UVB range from 290 to 320 nm with the highest 
absorption  at  290  nm.  The  calculated  molar  absorption  coefficients  were  23100  and  22500  L  mol-1  cm-1, 
respectively, exceeding the proposed threshold of 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 according to the ICH S10 guideline.  
The results from the in vitro 3T3 assay, utilizing promethazine hydrochloride as a positive control, indicated 
that darolutamide is not phototoxic.

Darolutamide is not a PBT substance.  
Considering the above data, darolutamide should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in 
order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
The results of the Fish Multi Generation Life-Cycle test with Pimephales promelas was questioned. A high 
variability of spawning between the control replicates was reported and excluding one replicate as an outliner 
from the statistical evaluation was discussed. This would have resulted in an Risk Quotient above 1. Due to 
the methodological issue of excluding one replicate and the fact that non-spawning fish in fathead minnow 
(Pimephales promelas) in laboratory studies are part of the natural variation, additional data are required to 
conclude on the potential risk of darolutamide to the aquatic environment. As a result of the above 
considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of darolutamide to 
the environment.  
The applicant commits to perform the following studies as follow-up measures: a fish study following the 
OECD 229 guideline. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data package for darolutamide has been conducted in line with ICH M3 and S9 guidelines.

In vitro, darolutamide exhibited low nanomolar potency inhibition against rat androgen receptor, which was 
similar with the inhibitory activity observed with bicalutamide. Darolutamide, its diastereomers and metabolite 
were potent and full hAR antagonists (more effective than bicalutamide). Moreover, bicalutamide showed an 
agonistic activity at concentrations above 100 nM, whereas darolutamide did not have an agonistic activity up 
to 3 µM. The two diastereomers and the metabolite showed a modest agonistic activity in HEK293 cells (65 
nM). 
The agonistic activity was also measured by the capacity to induce an AR nuclear translocation. Bicalutamide 
was 25-times more potent than darolutamide and 5-times more potent than ORM-15341 (active metabolite) in 
inducing AR nuclear localization. Both compounds also inhibited testosterone-induced nuclear translocation of 
AR better than bicalutamide. Additional in vitro  binding studies revealed darolutamide and its metabolite as 
antagonists  in  W742L,  F877L  and  T878A  mutations  of  the  AR  whereas,  bicalutamide  showed  an  agonistic 
activity against W741L mutant and enzalutamide and apalutamide showed an agonistic activity against F876L 
mutant.  Although  AR  binding  was  shown  in  cellular  systems,  no  information  related  to  the  potential  genes 
transcription after darolutamide treatment, including PSA, was reported. The applicant submitted the results 
from a set of studies (Sugawara et al 2019), in which darolutamide reduced the gene expression of androgen 
target  gene  expression,  such  as  KLK3  and  FKBP5.  Moreover,  the  racemate,  the  (S,R)  and  (S,S)  forms  of 
darolutamide were shown to behave similarly in several cellular assays (prostate cancer cells lines, AR activity, 
AR wild-type and mutant dimerization). The capacity of darolutamide and its metabolite to inhibit the prostate 
cancer  cell  growth  was  better  than  bicalutamide  (100%  inhibition  vs  65%).  Overall,  all  three  substances 
(darolutamide, (S,R) darolutamide and (S,S) darolutamide) show similar pharmacological activity in vitro. 
In  vivo,  darolutamide  showed  an  antagonistic  activity  on  rAR  with  a  decrease  of  the  relative  mass  of  the 
prostate and seminal vesicles in the immature rats. This decrease was observed even at the low concentration 
and was dose-dependent. An experiment was made to test the tumour re-growth after a first tumour growth 
suppressed by orchidectomy with a castration resistant prostate cancer in mice xenograft model. Darolutamide 
induced a xenograft tumour regression (50mg/kg darolutamide for 37 days) compared to untreated castrated 
mice and, the effect was higher at twice daily than once daily. 
The effect of darolutamide was tested on the growth of Vertebral-Cancer of the Prostate (VCaP) tumours in 
nude intact or castrated mice. The result was compared with enzalutamide, used as a reference compound. 
The  anti-tumour  activity  in  these  studies  was  not  compared  with  any  other  first  or  second-generation 
antiandrogen therapy. In both experiments, no change in the tumour weight was observed but a decrease on 
the serum PSA level was observed. For the castrated mice, a dose-dependent trend of inhibition of the tumour 
growth was observed. 
No  in  vivo  pharmacology  studies  conducted  with  diastereomers  were  provided.  However,  as  the  two 
diastereomers (S,S)-darolutamide and (S,R)-darolutamide rapidly interconvert enzymatically in vivo, the use 
of a mixture of the two diastereomers in the final drug product ODM-201 (1:1 mixture of the two diastereomers 
(S,R) and (S,S)) is considered acceptable.  
In  view  of  the  secondary  pharmacodynamics  data  provided,  side  effects  like  tiredness,  sexual  dysfunction, 
neurological disorders and seizure can be expected but at low risk because the brain distribution of darolutamide 
is low. Preclinical studies in rodents have demonstrated low blood-brain barrier penetration of darolutamide 
with a brain/plasma ratio <0.05. This may portend less CNS-related side effects in humans, as compared to 
available therapies, which showed an about 10-fold higher brain/plasma ratio. 
A specific study was conducted on GABAa receptor. Enzalutamide and apalutamide are well known to induce 
seizures by an antagonistic activity on GABAa receptor. Darolutamide and its metabolite seem less potent to 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 38/137 
  
  
  
 
induce seizures because their IC50 for GABAa inhibition were higher than the one for enzalutamide and the 
brain distribution of darolutamide was weak. Moreover, no seizure was observed in vivo in animals.  
Gastrointestinal  tract  was  identified  as  a  potential  off  target  for  darolutamide.  Rats  administered  with 
darolutamide showed delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit at 30 mg/Kg of darolutamide, which was 
attributed to the activity on receptor GABAA which is found in the myenteric neurons, being a modulator of 
motor and secretory GI activity. A review for the potential actions of darolutamide on GABA receptors, hPR and 
serotonin  transporters  was  submitted.  The  correspondent  margin  of  exposure  was  also  estimated  after 
comparison of IC50 values for each receptor with therapeutic human free Cmax. The review concluded that 
exposure obtained after darolutamide administration is slightly below the concentration requested to exert an 
effect on the analysed receptors. Thus, darolutamide is unlikely to produce an effect on the gastrointestinal 
tract, although it cannot be ruled out. 
In terms of cardiovascular safety assessment, darolutamide weakly inhibited in vitro the hERG current and 
dose-dependently inhibited the L-type calcium channel. In vivo, in anaesthetised dogs, darolutamide slightly 
decreased the QT interval duration, but this effect was not found in conscious dogs.  (see SmPC section 5.3). 
QT/QTc shortening and AV block exhibited in the anaesthetized dog study was attributed by the applicant to 
anaesthesia effects. It was noted that the two in vitro studies were not conducted in compliance with GLP 
standard. Furthermore, there was no control group and no analysis related to the effect of the metabolite and 
one of the diastereomers in the non-conscious dog study. Also, no study with (S,S) diastereomer in conscious 
dogs was provided when anaesthesia was considered to justify the observed AV-block. Considering these 
limitations and the available results from safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, the risk for QT 
prolongation cannot be excluded in clinic and adequate measures have been included in the SmPC (see also 
discussion clinical safety).  
With regards to the CNS and respiratory system, darolutamide was well tolerated up to the highest dose of 
1000  mg/kg/day  in  the  corresponding  studies  in  rats.  No  physiologically  relevant  acute  effects  on  CNS  and 
respiratory function were seen. Furthermore, no clear treatment-related neurobehavioral abnormalities were 
noted although a slight trend for reduced motor activity was observed in both sexes at ≥300 mg/kg/day in 
week 3. This was accompanied by a reduced alertness in males. No significant alteration in motor activity or 
behaviour were observed in the 4-week repeat dose study in rats. The absence of follow-up and supplemental 
studies in CNS do not permit to conclude a definitive effect of darolutamide on the CNS system from a non-
clinical point of view. However, clinical data indicated no increase in cognitive and memory issues. 
In terms of pharmacokinetics, the qualitative metabolite profiles of darolutamide in rats as well as the overall 
biotransformation pathways seem to be quite comparable to the profiles obtained in human plasma. However, 
the metabolite profiles of darolutamide between dogs and human are different. The dogs are more exposed to 
darolutamide  whereas  humans  are  more  exposed  to  keto-darolutamide.  As  darolutamide  and  keto-
darolutamide have the same pharmacologic activity this metabolite profile difference is not a relevant problem. 
Despite differences between species in the ratio of diastereomers (S,R)-darolutamide to (S,S)-darolutamide, 
the available results clearly showed interconversion of diastereomers in vivo. 
The  safety  profile  of  darolutamide  was  characterised  in  rats  and  dogs  through  the  conduct  of  repeat-dose 
toxicity studies of up to 6- and 9-month, toxicokinetic data, genotoxicity and phototoxicity studies. No single 
dose toxicity study was conducted which is acceptable in line with Guideline ICH S9. 
According to the pre-clinical data and consistent with the pharmacologic activity, the primary target organ was 
the reproductive system. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, the main findings were changes in 
the male reproductive organs (decreases in organ weight with atrophy of the prostate and epididymides). These 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 39/137 
  
  
  
 
effects occurred at systemic exposures in the range of or below the anticipated human exposure (based on 
AUC comparison). Additional changes to reproductive tissues included minimal increase in vacuolation of the 
pituitary gland, atrophy and secretory reduction in seminal vesicles and mammary glands in rats as well as 
testicular  hypospermia,  seminiferous  tubule  dilatation  and  degeneration  in  dogs.  Changes  in  the  male 
reproductive  organs  in  both  species  were  consistent  with  the  pharmacological  activity  of  darolutamide  and 
reversed or partially resolved after 4- to 8-week recovery periods (see SmPC section 4.8). No others adverse 
effects were observed. No deaths occurred during the treatment period. The relevance of the dog study was 
questioned considering that dogs were mostly exposed to (S,R)-Darolutamide (around 90%) while humans are 
mostly  exposed  to  (S,S)-darolutamide.  The  exposure  multiple  to  (S,S)-Darolutamide  in  dogs  compared  to 
humans  is  very  low,  with  a  maximum  exposure  multiple  as  low  as  0.3  (AUC0_24h).  However,  the  safety 
assessment of the diastereomers is considered adequate considering the similar activity of the diastereomers, 
the in vivo enzymatic interconversion, the total exposure of both stereoisomers, and the 3Rs policy. 
Long  term  animal  studies  to  evaluate  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  darolutamide  have  not  been  submitted. 
From a clinical point of view, the median overall survival for this condition is 4 years, with a substantial number 
of patients that will survive beyond this point and thus could be at risk of secondary tumours due to treatment. 
Therefore,  the  claimed  indication  cannot  be  considered  as  advanced  cancer  and  a  non-clinical  approach 
following  the  ICHS9  guideline  is  not  endorsed.  The  applicant  has  been  asked  to  justify  the  absence  of 
carcinogenesis  studies  for  darolutamide  with  solid  proofs  of  any  carcinogenic  effects  during  the  non-clinical 
toxicity studies (weight-of-evidence) and, possibly, publicly available information on carcinogenic potential of 
other drugs of the same class. The applicant was asked to elaborate on the possible reasons for a different 
non-clinical  safety  profile  between  darolutamide  and  the  already  approved  non-steroidal  antiandrogens 
(apalutamide  and  enzalutamide)  which  are  subject  to  carcinogenicity  studies.  Whereas  proliferative  events 
(hypertrophy)  was  observed  in  the  repeated-dose  toxicity  package  for  apalutamide,  no  proliferative  events 
were  observed  in  non-clinical  studies  for  darolutamide.  The  results  of  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  for 
apalutamide are not yet available. Enzalutamide 2-year carcinogenicity study showed urothelium papilloma and 
carcinoma  of  urinary  bladder  that  could  be  potentially  related  to  calculi  and  crystals.  Other  tumours  were 
observed, potentially related to the primary pharmacology. It included fibroadenoma of mammary glands and 
benign thymoma of thymus in males, benign granulosa cell tumours of ovaries in females, and adenoma of 
pituitary pars distalis in both sexes. In the absence of relevant data to adequately assess the carcinogenicity 
potential of darolutamide, the applicant will submit results of a 6-month Tg-rasH2 mouse study (see RMP). 
No  antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence,  metabolites,  impurities  studies  were  submitted  which  is 
considered  acceptable  for  this  compound.  Darolutamide  belongs  to  a  class  of  products  with  a  documented 
absence of dependence potential. Moreover, no dependence effects were observed in the toxicology study in 
vivo. With regards to the metabolites, keto-darolutamide was the major metabolite in all animal species and 
its pharmacological activity was similar to darolutamide.  
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  studies  were  submitted  which  was  considered  acceptable  as 
darolutamide is not administered as a combination therapy with other anti-tumour drugs. 
Darolutamide  is  considered  as  a  non-phototoxic  compound  based  on  available  data.  Rash  (mostly  maculo-
papular) were observed in the clinical studies but did not seem to be drug-related. 
Studies  on  reproductive  toxicity  have  not  been  submitted  which  was  considered  in  line  with  the 
recommendations of the ICH S9 guideline. However, male fertility is likely to be impaired based on the findings 
in repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs, which are consistent with the pharmacological activity of 
darolutamide  as  discussed  above  (see  SmPC  section  5.3).  It  is  not  known  whether  darolutamide  or  its 
metabolites are present in semen. In human, darolutamide half-life was around 5 days in the worst case. If the 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 40/137 
  
  
  
 
patient is engaged in sexual activity with a woman of childbearing potential, a highly effective contraceptive 
method (<1% failure rate per year) should be used during and for 1 week after completion of treatment with 
darolutamide to prevent pregnancy (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.6).   
Nubeqa is not indicated in women of childbearing potential. It is not to be used in women who are, or may be, 
pregnant or breast-feeding (see SmPC sections 4.1 and 4.3). Based on its mechanism of action, darolutamide 
may cause foetal harm. Exposure of the foetus to an androgen receptor inhibitor through seminal transfer to 
the pregnant woman has to be avoided, as this could affect development of the foetus. Therefore, darolutamide 
is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant (see SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.6). 
It is also unknown whether darolutamide or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. No studies in animals 
have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  excretion  of  darolutamide  or  its  metabolites  into  milk  (see  SmPC 
section 5.3). A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. 
With regards to fertility, animal studies showed that darolutamide affected the reproductive system in male 
rats and dogs (see above and SmPC section 5.3). There are no human data on the effect of darolutamide on 
fertility. Based on animal studies, Nubeqa may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see SmPC 
section 4.6).  
Regarding genotoxicity, darolutamide did not induce mutations in the microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay. 
At high concentrations, darolutamide did induce structural chromosome aberrations in vitro in cultured 
human lymphocytes. However, in the in vivo combined bone marrow micronucleus test and the Comet assay 
in the liver and duodenum of the rat, no genotoxicity was observed at exposures in excess of the maximum 
human exposure. The genotoxicity effects were observed at exposure in excess of the maximum human 
exposure (see SmPC section 5.3), indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
Concerning  the  Environmental  risk  assessment,  the  logKow  value  of  darolutamide  was  below  4.5. 
Consequently, this substance cannot be identified as a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance. 
Since the Phase I PECsw of Darolutamide (6μg/L) exceed the action limit of 0.01μg/L, and that it is a hormonal 
drug, darolutamide was further assessed in environmental fate and ecotoxicological effects studies. A Phase II 
environmental fate and effects assessment was performed according to EMA Guideline. The available data do 
not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of darolutamide to the aquatic environment, especially 
to fish. The applicant is recommended to perform a fish study following the OECD 229 guideline.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Darolutamide development has been performed in line with ICH S9 guideline. All important non-clinical safety 
findings which have been identified during development have been adequately addressed.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
The applicant should provide the results of the 6-month Tg-rasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study by 30 June 
2022 (see RMP).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Darolutamide is poorly soluble in aqueous solvents over a large pH range and generally more soluble in organic 
solvents (see SmPC section 5.2). It is a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 2 compound (low 
solubility,  high  permeability).  The  final  drug  product  is  a  300  mg  film-coated  tablet  (see  quality  aspects). 
Besides the proposed tablet, a 100 mg powder-in-capsule was developed and used in early Phase ½ clinical 
trials, and minor variants of the proposed tablet were also developed. The tested drug products forms were 
bridged with the final drug product for commercial use by a bioequivalence study. The recommended dose is 
600 mg (2 x 300 mg tablet) twice daily (b.i.d.), equal to a total daily dose of 1200 mg. Darolutamide has been 
studied in patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, and in patients with non-
metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) in a Phase 3 study (see Table 18).

Bioanalytical method 
The  two  diastereomers  (S,R)-darolutamide  and  (S,S)-darolutamide  and  the  main  active  metabolite,  keto-
darolutamide  were  quantified  by  LC-MS/MS  in  human  plasma.  The  validation  of  these  methods  met  the 
acceptance criteria. The two parent diastereomers were also quantified with LC-MS/MS in urine samples. This 
method was adequately qualified in urine. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The clinical pharmacokinetics of darolutamide was analysed using both descriptive non-compartmental analyses 
(NCA) and a population PK (Pop-PK) based compartmental analysis. In the formal PK studies, standard NCA 
approach  was  performed.  Pharmacokinetic  variables,  e.g.  AUC0-t,  AUCinf,  Cmax,  Cmin,  tmax,  and  t1/2  were 
calculated according to standard procedures. 
The Pop-PK analysis was conducted based on the non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. This approach 
estimated the typical (median) value of parameters and their variances. Model parameter estimation and model 
evaluation were implemented with NONMEM 7.2. 
Absorption  
Darolutamide consists of two diastereomers [(S,R) darolutamide and (S,S) darolutamide] which interconvert 
via the main circulating metabolite called keto darolutamide. Two studies, study 17831 (mass-balance + iv 
administration) and study 17830 (bioequivalence) informed darolutamide absorption.  
Darolutamide is absorbed within the 6h hours after drug administration.  
After oral administration of 300 mg [14C]darolutamide given as a solution under fasted conditions in comparison 
to an intravenous dose, approximately 100% of the compound is absorbed and becomes bioavailable. When 
the  same  dose  is  given  as  a  tablet  under  fasted  conditions,  approximately  30%  of  darolutamide  becomes 
bioavailable indicating limited solubility and incomplete absorption. Absorption of darolutamide from a tablet 
formulation  was  increased  by  a  factor  of  2.0-2.5-fold  (corresponding  to  60-75%  of  darolutamide  absorbed) 
when given together with a high-fat or a low-fat meal (fasted Tmax = 3h vs fed Tmax = 6h). A similar increase 
of exposure was observed for the major metabolite keto darolutamide. 
The  PK  of  darolutamide,  each  of  the  two  diastereomers,  and  the  active  metabolite  ketodarolutamide  was 
determined in the PK subset (388 patients) of Study 17712. Individual area-under-the-curve from time zero to 
12 hours at steady state (AUC(0-12)ss) and individual maximal and minimal concentrations at steady state 
(Cmaxss, Cminss) were calculated for the PK population using the selected Phase 3 popPK model after 15 days 
of nominal Q12h dosing of 600 mg b.i.d. using numerical integration. Following repeated oral administration of 
600 mg b.i.d, peak plasma concentrations of darolutamide of 4.79 mg/L (coefficient of variation: 30.9%) are 
usually  reached  around  4  hours  after  administration.  A  geometric  mean  AUC(0-12)  at  steady-state  of 
52.8 h·μg/mL  was  calculated  for  nmCRPC  patients  which  is  1.8-fold  higher  compared  to  the  AUC(0-12)  in 
healthy volunteers. Accordingly, the effective half-life representing the accumulation of darolutamide increases 
from 13 hours in healthy volunteers to approximately 20 hours in nmCRPC patients. The respective half-life 
values for (S,R)-darolutamide and (S,S)-darolutamide were 9 and 22 hours, respectively (see also sub-section 
on elimination). In parallel, the ratio of the two diastereomers changed from a 1:1 ratio in the tablet to an 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 46/137 
  
  
  
 
 
approximately 1:9 ratio in plasma in these patients at steady-state. Due to the different effective half-lives in 
nmCRPC  patients,  steady-state  of  (S,R)-darolutamide  is  reached  after  2  days  and  that  of  and  (S,S)-
darolutamide after 5 days following repeated b.i.d. dosing together with food.  
Bioequivalence 
Three drug product forms were used throughout the drug development: tablet A, tablet B and capsules. These 
three  drug  forms  were  compared  in  a  formal  clinical  trial,  study  17830,  which  was  open-label,  randomized, 
uncontrolled, multicenter Phase 1 clinical study of darolutamide in patients (N=30) with chemotherapy-naïve 
mCRPC. The study consisted of two components: a 3-period crossover PK component. Two concurrent groups, 
evaluating 2 separate test products, Tablet A and Tablet B. There was a 600 mg single dose administration of 
darolutamide 600 mg in the PK Component: 1) tablets administered in the fed state, 2) tablets administered 
in the fasted state and 3) capsules administered in the fed state. Subjects were randomised to one of the 2 
test tablets and to one of 3 treatment sequences. There was a wash-out period of at least 7 days between 
study treatment administrations.  
These formulations were bioequivalent based on the dedicated study (study 17830). 
Distribution 
Based  on  study  17831  in  healthy  volunteers  following  intravenous  administration  of  100  μg  of 
[14C]darolutamide,  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  was  119  L  indicating  that  darolutamide  is  widely 
distributed throughout the body to both intracellular and extracellular fluid spaces.  
In vitro plasma protein binding of the two diastereomers (S,R) and (S,S) darolutamide is moderate in human 
plasma with a mean free fraction of 8%, whereas the metabolite ketodarolutamide mean free faction is lower 
and estimated to 0.2%.  
Elimination 
Elimination parameters were based on the mass-balance study 17831 in healthy volunteers with (N=6), study 
17830  based  on  the  bioavailability  study  comparing  two  drug  forms  and  food  effect  in  mCRPC  patients 
(N=2x15) and population PK analysis including the pivotal study (study 17712) in nmCRPC patients (N=388, 
PK subset). 
Darolutamide is mainly excreted via urinary route by 63.4% based on the mass-balance study (study 17831) 
with 7% excreted unchanged, and via faeces by 32.4% with 30.7% unchanged fraction. More than 95% of the 
dose was recovered within 7 days after administration. 
The  renal  clearance  were  estimated  to  134.85  mL/min  for  (S,R)-darolutamide  and  91.84  mL/min  for  (S,S) 
darolutamide. The ratio [(S,S):(S,R)] was estimated to be 1.46. These renal clearances normalized by eGFR 
are estimated 1.58 for (S,R)-darolutamide and 1.07 for (S,S)-darolutamide.  
The effective half-life of darolutamide and keto darolutamide in plasma of patients is approximately 20 hours. 
Of  the  two  diastereomers comprising  darolutamide,  (S,R)  darolutamide  has  a  shorter  effective  half  life of  9 
hours compared to (S,S) darolutamide with an effective half life of 22 hours. The clearance of darolutamide 
following intravenous administration was 116 mL/min (CV: 39.7%). 
(S,R)-darolutamide  half-life  was  two-fold  shorter  than  the  (S,S)-diastereomer  due  to  the  preferential  back 
conversion of the metabolite (ketodarolutamide) into the (S,S) diastereomer. 
EMA/84124/2020

Metabolism 
The human metabolism was identified with the metabolism profiling of samples collected from the mass-balance 
study  (study  17831).  The  enzymes  involved  in  darolutamide  main  metabolites  formation  are  CYP3A4  for 
ketodarolutamide and UGT1A9, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 for O-glucuronides formation. 
Following single oral administration of 300 mg 14 C-darolutamide given as an oral solution, keto-darolutamide 
is  the  only  major  metabolite  with  about  2-fold  higher  total  exposure  in  plasma  compared  to  darolutamide. 
Darolutamide  and  keto-darolutamide  accounted  together  for  87.4%  of  the 14 C-radioactivity  in  plasma 
indicating that all other metabolites are of minor importance.  
Darolutamide  is  metabolised  primarily  by  oxidative  metabolism  mediated  mainly  by  CYP3A4,  as  well  as  by 
direct glucuronidation mediated preferentially by UGT1A9 and UGT1A1. In addition, mainly the AKR1C isoforms 
were shown to catalyse the reduction of keto-darolutamide to the substance diastereomers. 
The main active metabolite ketodarolutamide is formed by mainly CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent CYP1A1. This 
metabolite was found at 58.8% of the total dose (based on the total radioactivity from the mass-balance study) 
in plasma with only minor excretion as unchanged keto-darolutamide metabolite (0.6%) in faeces. 
The other metabolites were drug O-glucuronides M-7 (25.5% of dose), drug N-glucuronides M-15 (5.75% of 
dose), and pyrazole sulfate metabolite M-29 (6.2% of dose). The unlabelled pyrazole metabolites M-32, M-33, 
M-34 and M-36 represented only minor metabolites. 
Clinical studies (studies 17830, 17831, 17829) showed an increase in the diastereomers ratio based on the 
exposure ratio [(S,S):(S,R)] of approximately [5:1] to [6:1] and a linear increase in plasma concentration ratio 
between  the  two  diastereomers  with  time.  This  supported  the  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite, 
ketodarolutamide into (S,S)-darolutamide. 
Based  on  population  PK  parameters  estimated  using  the  pivotal  study  (study  17712)  in  nmCRPC  patients 
receiving 600 mg bid orally, ketodarolutamide Tmax was 2h which is similar to (S,R)-darolutamide and two 
hours earlier than (S-S) darolutamide Tmax. Ketodarolutamide half-life was close to the main diastereomer 
(S,S)  and  the  metabolite’s  exposure  was  also  almost  1.6  fold  greater  than  the  parent  compound,  i.e. 
darolutamide (as the sum of the two parent diastereomers). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A formal dose escalation was performed in mCRPC patients with increasing dose from 100 mg b.i.d. up to 900 
mg with food. The dose dependency was tested by a linear regression all doses included.  
In  the  dose  range  of  100  to  700  mg  (after  single  dose  and  at  steady  state),  the  exposure  to  the  two 
diastereomers and the major metabolite keto darolutamide increases linearly in a nearly dose related manner. 
Based on a saturated absorption, no further increase in exposure to darolutamide was observed at 900 mg 
twice daily. 
Darolutamide steady state was assessed in the dose escalation study (study 17829). It was achieved within 
7 days which is consistent with the effective half-life at steady state of approximately 20h. The accumulation 
ratios were estimated to 1.96 [1.71-2.26] (95% confidence interval) and 2.4 [2.13-2.77]) for AUC(0-t) and Cmax 
respectively.

Population PK modelling  
An  exploratory  population  PK  (pop-PK)  analysis  was  performed  for  (S,R)-,  (S,S)-  darolutamide  and 
ketodarolutamide following multiple oral dose of darolutamide (report 18651).  
The analysed datasets included a total of 555 patients and 3158 samples from two datasets: the pivotal phase 
3 study 17712 (in nmCRPC patients with sparse sampling on day 15, day 29, and week 23) and the pool of two 
phase  1/2  studies  17829  and  17830  (in  mCRPC  patients  with  rich  PK  sampling  to  describe  the  absorption 
phase).  These  data  from  phase  1/2  were  box-cox  transformed  (right  skewed  distribution)  and  fitted 
simultaneously with the untransformed phase 3 data (normally distributed).  
The  final  PK  model  consisted  in  two  central  compartments,  one  for  each  diastereomer.  (S,  R)-darolutamide 
absorption  phase  was  described  by  4  transit  compartments,  whereas  (S,S)-darolutamide  absorption  was 
modelled  with  one  depot  compartment.  From  the  two  central  compartments  of  each  diastereomer,  the  two 
parent  compounds  are  metabolized  into  a  single  compartment  representing  the  active  metabolite 
ketodarolutamide.  
Error terms were estimated for each study with two types of error model applied: additive error model for the 
Box-Cox transformed dataset (i.e. phase 1/2, namely study 17829 and study 17830) and proportional error 
for the phase 3 study dataset (study 17712). In general, for the two diastereomers and the active metabolite, 
ketodarolutamide, the variabilities on the residual error terms were heterogeneous in the three datasets used 
(studies 17829 and 17830 box-cox transformed and study 17712 not transformed).  
For  (S,R)-darolutamide,  the  variability  on  the  additional  error  terms  on  Box  Cox  transformed  data  were 
reasonable (CV% = 20.8% for study 17829 and CV%=28.4% for study 17830), whereas it was moderate for 
the proportional error term in study 17712 (CV%=37.10%). 
For (S,S)-darolutamide, the variabilities on error terms were only acceptable for study 17829 (BC transformed 
CV=21.2%) and study 17712 (CV=24.4%) and moderate for study 17830 (BC-transformed CV=32.4%) 
For the ketodarolutamide, the variabilities on error term were only acceptable for study 17830 (BC transformed 
CV=23.3%),  whereas  it  was  moderate  for  study  17829  (BC-transformed  CV=38.7%)  and  study  17713 
(CV=33.6%). 
The estimated clearance was 4.58 L/h which appears to be consistent the estimated data using NCA analysis 
on formal clinical study (CL= 6.78 L/h, i.e. 116 mL/min from report R-11003 of study 17831). The estimated 
Tmax,ss by  the  pop-PK  model  were  within  the  range  of  the  observed  data  in  mCRPC  patients  from  the  dose 
escalation study 17829 (1.84 h estimated vs 2h for (S,R)-darolutamide; and 4.73 h estimated vs 4h for (S,S)-
darolutamide). 
Darolutamide was found to be extensively distributed as evidenced by large apparent volume of distribution. 
The  estimated  distribution  volume  of  159-198L  (Vd=  119  L  and  F=  60-75%  from  report  R-11003  of  study 
17831) and estimated clearance (4.58 L/h IC95% [4.41 - 4.75]) were not consistent with the observed data 
(V/F= 44.5 L and CL= 7L/h).  
Inter-individual variability (IIV) was modelled using a full variance-covariance matrix. IIV for CL was moderate 
for CL/F (CV% =39.5%) and high for KA 1,2,3 (54.6%).  
Overall,  the  population  typical  values  were  precisely  estimated  (low  RSE<15%  for  the  fixed  effects  with 
exception of TFAST (RSE%=17.99%), ACAP (RSE%=17.94%), AFAST (RSE%=17.25%)).

Special populations  
Gender 
The PK of darolutamide, its major metabolite keto-darolutamide and diastereomers revealed a small effect 
with up to 1.7-fold higher exposure (AUC) and 1.3- to 1.5-fold higher maximum plasma concentrations, as 
well as prolonged terminal half-lives in females compared to males in study 17723 (darolutamide t1/2= 11.6 
h in male and 15.8 h in female).  
Race 
Exposure of darolutamide observed in 9 Japanese patients with prostate cancer (mCRPC) in study 17719 was 
in the same range compared to Caucasian patients with mCRPC evaluated in previous studies, but the 
exposure was at the upper end of that range.  
Similar data were observed in the Phase 3 study 17712. A population PK analysis showed an approximately 
1.4-fold higher mean AUC(0-12)ss in patients in the Japanese region compared to patients from all other 
regions. However, there was still a large overlap of the exposure in Japanese compared to the exposure in 
patients from the other regions.  
Weight 
No effect of body weight was concluded based on the population PK covariate analysis.  
Age 
No effect in the elderly (by age group <65 years, 65 ≤years<75, 75 ≤years<85, ≥85 years) was concluded 
based on the population PK covariate analysis.

Hepatic impairment 
In a clinical pharmacokinetic study following a single dose 600 mg darolutamide administration Cmax and AUC 
for darolutamide were 1.5 and 1.9-fold higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) 
compared to healthy volunteers. There are no data for patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh C). 
Renal impairment 
In a clinical pharmacokinetic study following a single dose 600 mg darolutamide administration, AUC and Cmax 
for darolutamide were 2.5 and 1.6-fold higher in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated 
Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to healthy volunteers. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates a 1.1-, 1.3- and an approximately 1.5-fold higher exposure 
(AUC)  of  darolutamide  in  patients  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  (eGFR  15 to 
89 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to patients with normal renal function.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vitro data, three clinical interaction studies were conducted to assess the magnitude of the 
potential interactions with darolutamide.

rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Single-center, non-randomized, fixed-sequence, two-period design 
Healthy White male or female subjects (in postmenopausal state) between 45 and 65 years of 
age with a body mass index between 18.0 (inclusive) and 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive) 
N: 30 (15 males 15 female) / 29 (15 males/ 14 females)

Period 2: rosuvastatin 5 mg single dose administrations on Day 08 single  
             darolutamide  600  mg  on  Day  01,  and  multiple  dose  administrations  of  600  mg  twice 
daily for 5 days (Day 04 to Day 08) 
Results from the present study demonstrated a substantial effect of darolutamide on the PK of the 
transporter substrate rosuvastatin. AUC(0-24) and Cmax of rosuvastatin given in combination with 
darolutamide under steady state conditions and in the fed state were approximately 5-fold higher compared 
to those parameters of rosuvastatin given alone. However, time to reach peak plasma concentrations and the 
elimination rate of rosuvastatin was not influenced by comedication of darolutamide. Likewise, the renal 
clearance of rosuvastatin did not change during co-medication with darolutamide.

(midazolam) 
To evaluate the effect of darolutamide on the PK of P-gp substrate (nonconjugated dabigatran) 
Single center, open-label, non-randomized, fixed-sequence, three periods 
Healthy male, 45 to 65 years of age (inclusive) 
N: 15/13 
Period 1: dabigatran 75 mg single dose + midazolam 1 mg D01 
Period 2: darolutamide 600 mg b.i.d. D1 to D11 + 75 mg dabigatran D09 + 1 mg midazolam D09 
Concomitant dosing of MDZ with 600 mg BID darolutamide on Day 9 of BID darolutamide treatment led to a 
decrease  of  approx.  29%  and  22%  in  AUC  of  MDZ  and  1-OH  midazolam,  respectively.  Likewise,  maximum 
plasma concentrations decreased by approx. 32% for both MDZ and 1-OH midazolam when compared to dosing 
of MDZ without darolutamide.  
Darolutamide decreased total AUC of non-conjugated and total dabigatran by 9% and 12% respectively. This 
decrease  was  slightly  more  pronounced  for  Cmax  (16%  and  17%  decrease  for  non-conjugated  and  total

D07 (multiple dose) 
Period 3: darolutamide 600 mg single dose D08 + 600 mg rifampicin D01 to D10 
Concomitant administration of darolutamide with the CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor itraconazole or the CYP3A4 
inducer rifampicin at steady state had a marked effect on the PK of darolutamide, its diastereomers and 
major metabolite. Concomitant administration of itraconazole resulted in 1.75-, 1.70-, 1.76- and 1.80-fold 
higher mean AUC(0-72) and in 1.36-, 1.50-, 1.38- and 1.39-fold higher mean maximum plasma 
concentrations of darolutamide, (S,R)-, (S,S)- and keto-darolutamide, respectively, thus classifying 
darolutamide as weakly sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of rifampicin led to a 
decrease to 28, 24, 29 and 25% of mean AUC(0-72) and a decrease to 48, 37, 51 and 47% of mean 
maximum plasma concentrations of darolutamide, (S,R)-, (S,S)- and keto-darolutamide, respectively, 
compared to darolutamide alone.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Darolutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor with a flexible polar substituted pyrazole structure that 
binds with high affinity directly to the receptor ligand binding domain. Darolutamide competitively inhibits 
androgen binding, AR nuclear translocation, and AR mediated transcription. A major metabolite, keto-
darolutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to darolutamide. Darolutamide treatment decreases prostate 
tumour cell proliferation leading to potent antitumour activity (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by prostate cells and is an established biomarker of 
disease management in prostate cancer. Expression of the PSA gene is directly regulated by binding of AR 
and therefore darolutamide is expected to negatively regulate the PSA levels. A PSA response was observed 
in the pivotal Phase 3 study in nmCRPC, with 83.6% of the patients having ≥50% decline in the serum PSA 
levels in the darolutamide arm. Comparable decreases in serum PSA levels were also seen in the supportive 
Phase 1/2 studies with the metastatic patient population. The best responses were seen in the chemo-
/CYP17i naïve subgroup (85.7% of the patients showed a PSA decline ≥50% in one study and 83.3% of the 
patients in another study).  
In addition, an exploratory exposure-PSA analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between the 
exposure of darolutamide and change in PSA over time (see section below on exposure efficacy relationship).  
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 52/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Darolutamide treatment had a positive effect on circulating tumour cells (CTC) counts, which decreased at all 
studied dose levels in the Phase 1/2 Study 17829.  
Pharmacodynamic serum hormone variables such as testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH), and DHT did not show any clinically relevant changes in mCRPC patients on ADT 
during treatment with darolutamide and were therefore not evaluated in subsequent clinical studies, including 
studies in nmCRPC patients.  
Additional biomarkers evaluated in mCRPC include bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), procollagen type I 
amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), chromogranin A (CgA), and serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 
(SPINK1), AR and ERG (TMPRSS2-ERG fusion expression). No clear association was observed with AR 
molecular status (copy number and mutations) and PSA response at Week 12. No clear association of ERG or 
SPINK1 expression status in archival tumour tissue samples and PSA response at Week 4 or Week 12 was 
observed. 
Exposure-response relationship 
Study 19792 
Title: Exploratory population pharmacodynamic analysis of change in prostate specific antigen over time in 
studies 17712, 17829 and 17830. 
The relationship between exposure and PSA was investigated using a covariate Pop-PD model with exposure 
as covariate. The model was adapted from Desmée et al. (2015) published model for prostate-specific antigen 
kinetics and link with survival in the context of metastatic prostate cancer. Two additional parameters were 
added: EM is the maximal log(PSA) reduction achieved with active treatment and ER is the decay rate constant 
of the treatment effect. 
The used exposures were simulated from the presented POP-PK model. They were related to EM parameter, 
the maximal PSA reduction achieved, by an Emax model. Other than exposure, other covariates were identified 
based on the forward/backward covariate selection.  
The proliferation rate was faster for patients with lower PSA Doubling Time. Higher haemoglobin at baseline 
and chemotherapy and CYP17 inhibitor naïve patients were found to show a greater maximum decrease in PSA. 
A dose of 600 mg bid resulted in close to maximum PSA reduction from baseline for chemotherapy and CYP17 
inhibitor naïve patients in both the phase 1-2 and phase 3 population. 
Study 18962 
Title: Exploratory exposure-response analysis of metastatic free survival (MFS) and darolutamide exposure, 
and of MFS and change in prostate specific antigen (PSA) under treatment with darolutamide in study 17712. 
Data from 1419 patients of study 17712 without baseline metastasis were used in this E-R analysis. 
PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA concentration (below or above population median) at baseline were 
significantly associated with MFS. Patients with a low PSADT (<25th percentile) and high PSA concentration 
(>median) at baseline experienced shorter MFS compared to patients with high PSADT (>75th percentile) 
and low PSA concentration (≤ median) at baseline. 
The maximum decrease in PSA from baseline was significantly associated with MFS for all patients treated 
with darolutamide. The fraction of patients surviving without metastases after 1 year of darolutamide 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 53/137 
  
  
  
 
treatment is predicted to range from approximately 95% for patients with a close to 100% decrease in PSA 
from baseline to approximately 80% for patients with a considerably lower decrease in PSA from baseline of 
around 40%. 
MFS was found to be consistent over the observed exposure range in Study 17712. The fraction of patients 
surviving without metastases after 1 year of darolutamide was predicted to be greater than 90% for 90% of 
the subjects irrespective if the analysis was based on the PK subset or on all darolutamide treated patients. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics and cardiac safety 
Study 19557  
This was an exploratory study which used concentration-QTc (C-QTc) modelling to assess the QTc interval 
prolongation risk of darolutamide based on data in a subset of patients from the phase 3 study 17712 in 
which triplicate ECG recordings with matched PK sampling were collected. All patients included in study 
17712 received the proposed therapeutic dose of 600 mg bid.  
The results of this ECG study showed no clear signal of any effect of darolutamide on heart rate, AV conduction 
as  measured  by  the  PR  interval,  or  cardiac  depolarization  as  measured  by  the  QRS  duration.  There  were 
relatively  balanced  rates  of  new  clinically  relevant  morphological  changes  in  the  darolutamide  and  placebo 
arms,  except  for  a  higher  incidence of  atrial  fibrillation  and  atrial  flutter  in  the  darolutamide  treatment arm 
(though 50% of these patients had a prior history of atrial tachyarrhythmias).  
There also was no signal of any effect of darolutamide on cardiac repolarization as evidenced by the results of 
the  by  time  point  analysis  in  a  separate  evaluation  of  the  effect  of  darolutamide  concentration  on  the  QTc 
interval in a PK subset of patients with nmCRPC.  
QTcF (QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Fridericia’s formula) was used in the concentration-QTc 
analysis.  The  results  of  the  time-averaged  and  outlier  analyses  showed  that  darolutamide  has  no  effect  on 
cardiac repolarization. In addition, an evaluation of any possible darolutamide concentration-QT interval (QTcF) 
relationship showed that the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the estimated difference in QTcF 
from  baseline  and  placebo  (ΔΔQTcF)  at  any  concentration  did  not  exceed  the  threshold  of  10ms  due  to  a 
negative slope of the concentration-QTcF relationship. 
The ECG results from the dedicated PK subset analysis in nmCRPC patients were consistent with those of the 
total safety population of the Phase 3 study in nmCRPC.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Three drug products forms were used throughout the drug development: tablet A, tablet B and capsules. These 
formulations were bioequivalent based on the dedicated study (study 17830) (data not shown). 
The pharmacokinetics profile has been sufficiently characterised. The estimated volume of distribution of 
darolutamide was larger than the whole body fluid volume suggesting tissue distribution.  
Darolutamide is moderately (92%) bound to human plasma proteins without any difference between the two 
diastereomers. The major metabolite of darolutamide, keto-darolutamide, is highly (99.8%) bound to plasma 
proteins. Given the very low free-fraction of the metabolite, keto-darolutamide contribution to the activity is 
unlikely.  
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 54/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Passage  of  darolutamide  across  the  blood  brain  barrier  has  not  been  studied  clinically.  However,  brain 
exposures to darolutamide in terms of AUC(0-24) are very low with 4.5% of plasma exposure after single dose 
in  rats  and  1.9-3.9%  after  repeated  dose  in  mice  (see  non-clinical  aspects).  This  indicates  low  passage  of 
darolutamide  across  the  intact  blood  brain  barrier  in  rats  and  mice  and  a  low  likelihood  that  darolutamide 
crosses the intact blood brain barrier in humans to a clinically relevant extent (see SmPC section 5.2). 
The diastereomers (S,R) darolutamide and (S,S) darolutamide are able to interconvert via the metabolite keto- 
darolutamide. Presented data are consistent with a back conversion of the metabolite ketodarolutamide into 
preferentially (S,S)-darolutamide. A back-conversion-mediated by AKR1C3 and to a lesser extent AKR1D1 was 
also reported. The human aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) is a super family of NAD(P)H linked oxido-reductases. 
The enzymes family were reported to be highly polymorphic with some SNPs of high penetrance (Penning and 
Crury, 2007). The impact of the AKR1C polymorphism review (Alshogran, 2017) highlighted limited available 
information on PK which leads to uncertainty on the clinical relevance of this enzyme polymorphism.  
Glucuronidation  is  expected  to  contribute  by  32.6% to  the  total  drug  clearance  which  is  not  negligible.  The 
potential impact clinical impact of UGT polymorphism was discussed based on literature review and its clinical 
consequences on exposure are considered limited.  
The drug is mainly excreted by renal passive glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The two diastereomers 
clearance was overall comparable. 
The dose linearity over the range 100 up to 700 mg is agreed. The proposed indicated dose of 600 b.i.d is 
covered by the dose linearity. 
With regards to special population, a formal study was conducted to assess gender effect in healthy 
volunteers. Darolutamide showed a gender effect with 1.3- to 1.7-fold higher exposure and maximum plasma 
concentrations as well as prolonged terminal half-lives in females. However, given the target population is 
patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, it is agreed that the gender effect is not 
relevant for this indication. 
No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide were observed based on ethnicity 
(White, Japanese, non-Japanese Asian, Black or African American). A population pharmacokinetic analysis 
indicated a 1.4 fold increase in exposure (AUC) in Japanese patients compared to patients from all other 
regions. (see SmPC section 5.2).  
Furthermore, no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide were observed based 
on age (48-95 years). No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Regarding paediatric population, there is no relevant use of darolutamide in the paediatric population for the 
indication of treatment of nmCRPC (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The available data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment are limited, and darolutamide has not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Following a single dose 600 mg darolutamide 
administration, a 1.9-fold increase in darolutamide exposure (AUC0-48h) was observed in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment. Thus, for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Classes B and C), the recommended starting dose is 300 mg twice daily (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2.). As exposure might be increased those patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
Following a single dose 600 mg darolutamide administration, there was a 2.5-fold increase in darolutamide 
exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. For patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 55/137 
  
  
  
 
15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2) not receiving haemodialysis, the recommended starting dose is 300 mg twice daily 
(see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). As exposure might be increased those patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of darolutamide has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving 
dialysis (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) (see SmPC section 5.2). 
In  vitro  studies  showed  that  darolutamide  is  a  UGT1A9,  UGT1A1,  UGT1A3  substrate  and  UGT1A9,  UGT1A1 
inhibitor  (see  non-clinical  section).  The  Applicant  considered  clinical  DDI  studies  with  UGT  isoform-selective 
inhibitors not necessary given the threshold of 25% for enzymes contributing to a drug elimination pathway. 
It  is  agreed  there  is  no  need  to  perform  a  clinical  study  to  evaluate  inhibition  for  UGT1A1,  as  atazanavir 
metabolism may be induced by darolutamide.  
With regards to darolutamide potential to inhibit UGT1A9, an AUCR of 1.11 was calculated for the extent of an 
interaction of the diastereomer (S,R)-darolutamide with a sensitive UGT1A9 substrate, e.g. dapagliflozin. As 
this  value is  lower  than the  threshold  AUCR  value  of  1.25,  these data  do  not indicate  a  risk  for perpetrator 
drug-drug interaction resulting from UGT1A9 inhibition by darolutamide. In relation to darolutamide being a 
UGT1A9 substrate the applicant presented literature data and real data from nmCRPC patients who took UGT 
inhibitors concomitantly showing an expected darolutamide exposure increase in the range of 1.2- and 1.5-fold 
when  darolutamide  is  given  together  with  an  UGT  inhibitor  compared  to  given  alone.  A  population 
pharmacokinetic analysis showed that co-administration of UGT1A9 inhibitors with darolutamide resulted in a 
1.2-fold increase in exposure (AUC0-72) of darolutamide. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected 
in case of UGT1A9 inhibitor administration. Darolutamide may be given concomitantly with UGT1A9 inhibitors 
(see SmPC section 4.5).  
Darolutamide is also a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Administration 
of itraconazole (200 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily on the following 7 days), a strong CYP3A4, P-gp 
and  BCRP  inhibitor,  with  a  single  dose  of  darolutamide  (600 mg  on  day 5  together  with  food)  resulted  in  a 
1.7-fold  increase  in  mean  exposure  (AUC0-72)  and  a  1.4-fold  increase  of  Cmax  of  darolutamide.  No  clinically 
relevant  drug-drug  interaction  is  expected  in  case  of  CYP3A4,  P-gp  or  BCRP  inhibitor  administration. 
Darolutamide  may  be  given  concomitantly  with  CYP3A4,  P-gp  or  BCRP  inhibitors.  Concomitant  use  of 
darolutamide with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases darolutamide exposure which may 
increase the risk of darolutamide adverse reactions. It is recommended to monitor patients more frequently 
for darolutamide adverse reactions and modify darolutamide dose as needed (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Repeated administration of rifampicin (600 mg), a strong CYP3A4 and a P-gp inducer, with a single dose of 
darolutamide (600 mg) together with food, resulted in a decrease of 72% in mean exposure (AUC0-72) and a 
decrease of 52% in Cmax of darolutamide. The use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers and P-gp inducers 
(e.g.  carbamazepine,  phenobarbital,  St.  John's  Wort,  phenytoin,  and  rifampicin)  during  treatment  with 
darolutamide may decrease the plasma concentration of darolutamide and is not recommended, unless there 
is no therapeutic alternative. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product, with no or weak potential 
to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp should be considered (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
The clinical DDI studies (Study 17723 with rosuvastatin, BCRP/OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitor) showed 
darolutamide is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and Organic Anion Transporting 
Polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3. Administration of darolutamide (600 mg twice daily for 5 days) prior to 
co-administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin (5 mg) together with food resulted in approximately 5-fold 
increase in mean exposure (AUC) and Cmax of rosuvastatin. Co administration of darolutamide with other 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 56/137 
  
  
  
 
BCRP substrates should be avoided where possible. Co-administration of darolutamide may increase the 
plasma concentrations of other concomitant BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates (e.g. methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin). 
Therefore, it is recommended to monitor patients for adverse reactions of BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
substrates, as co-administration with darolutamide may increase the plasma concentrations of these 
substrates. Co administration with rosuvastatin should be avoided unless there is no therapeutic alternative 
Selection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with less potential to inhibit BCRP, OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 should be considered (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
Co-administration of darolutamide together with the sensitive P-gp substrate dabigatran etexilate did not 
reveal any increase in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of dabigatran. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is 
expected in case of P-gp substrate administration. Darolutamide may be given concomitantly with P-gp 
substrates (e.g. digoxin, verapamil or nifedipine). 
Darolutamide is a mild inducer of CYP3A4. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected in case of 
CYP substrate administration. Darolutamide may be given concomitantly with CYP substrates (e.g. warfarin, 
L-thyroxine, omeprazole). Administration of darolutamide (600 mg twice daily for 9 days) prior to 
co-administration of a single dose of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam (1 mg) together with food, 
decreased the mean exposure (AUC) and Cmax of midazolam by 29% and 32%, respectively. 
Darolutamide is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro but not with clinical significance. Darolutamide did not 
inhibit the metabolism of selected CYP substrates in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In terms of pharmacodynamic data, PSA was used as surrogate biomarker which is considered appropriate. 
In general, the observed change from baseline in serum PSA showed that darolutamide has a clinically 
meaningful antitumour activity in mCRPC and nmCRPC patients. The conducted studies showed darolutamide 
decreased the level of PSA by over 50% in 83.3% to 85.7% of the patients in pivotal (83.6% of the patients) 
and supportive studies.  
From the population PK (POP-PK) model, the PSA doubling time, the haemoglobin rate at baseline and the 
chemotherapy and CYP17 inhibitor treatment status were identified as significant covariates on darolutamide 
efficacy. The lower the PSA doubling time, the faster the cancer cells proliferation rate was. The higher the 
haemoglobin rate, the greater the decrease in PSA was. If patients were treatment naïve, the decrease in 
PSA was higher. 
With regards to exposure-response relationship, the observed change in PSA over time in both the phase 1-2 
and phase 3 populations was adequately described by a previously published population PD model, which 
linked tumour proliferation to PSA turnover in the blood. The association between darolutamide exposure and 
the maximum change in PSA from baseline was best described with an Emax type model, which indicates 
that the PSA lowering effect of darolutamide reaches a maximum at higher exposure. The results suggested 
that a dose of 600 mg bid results in close to maximum PSA reduction from baseline for chemotherapy and 
CYP17 inhibitor naïve patients in both the phase 1-2 and phase 3 population. 
Study 18962 indicated that the relationship between darolutamide exposure and MFS is flat, which is in line 
with the analyses of the association between exposure and change in PSA, and between change in PSA and 
MFS. This suggests that, at the proposed dose of darolutamide 600 mg bid, the maximum response with 
respect to both PSA decrease and MFS is achieved. 
With respect to pharmacodynamics related to safety, the cardiac activity was monitored in patients receiving 
darolutamide treatment. No prolongation of the mean QTcF interval (i.e., greater than 10 ms) was observed 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 57/137 
  
  
  
 
after oral administration of 600 mg darolutamide twice daily compared to placebo (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The results of an ECG study in a PK subset of patients with nmCRPC showed no clear signal of any effect of 
darolutamide on heart rate, AV conduction as measured by the PR interval, or cardiac depolarization as 
measured by the QRS duration. There were relatively balanced rates of new clinically relevant morphological 
changes in the darolutamide and placebo arms, except for a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and atrial 
flutter in the darolutamide treatment arm (though 50% of these patients had a prior history of atrial 
tachyarrhythmias) (see also discussion on clinical safety).  
Overall, the pharmacodynamics of darolutamide have been sufficiently characterised. Although the clinical PD 
studies were exploratory in nature, the findings appear to support the proposed darolutamide dose of 600 mg 
bid. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of darolutamide has been sufficiently characterised.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Darolutamide was studied in the dose range from 100 to 900 mg b.i.d. in the dose escalation and dose 
finding study 17829 (ARADES). Dose-linearity of the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed after single 
and repeated administration in the dose range of 100 to 700 mg darolutamide b.i.d. At a higher dose (900 
mg b.i.d.), no further increase in the exposure and maximum concentration of darolutamide was observed, 
indicating that saturation of absorption may occur at doses higher than 700 mg of darolutamide b.i.d..  
The results of the expansion part of study 17829 (ARADES) suggest that the 700 mg b.i.d. dose is as safe 
and tolerable as the 100 or 200 mg b.i.d. dose levels. Independent of the dose (100, 200 or 700 mg b.i.d.), 
the best PSA responses were seen in the chemo-/CYP17i-naïve subgroup compared to the post-
chemo/CYP17i-naïve subgroup and the post-CYP17i subgroup. A dose-related response was seen in the 
chemo-/CYP17i-naïve subgroup, with a higher percentage of patients in the 700 mg b.i.d. dose group 
achieving a decline in PSA (85.7%) compared to the lower dose groups of 100 mg (45.5%) and 200 mg b.i.d. 
(69.2%). 
Study 17830 (ARAFOR) was conducted using a dose of 600 mg darolutamide b.i.d., a dose selected based on 
the initial results from study 17829 (ARADES) and non-clinical efficacy data in mice. Anti-tumour activity was 
demonstrated and darolutamide was well-tolerated in the study. Plasma exposure plateau was seen from 
700 mg bd dose in the ARADES study and darolutamide plasma exposure after 600 mg bid in the ARAFOR 
study was similar to what was observed after 700 mg bid in the ARADES study.

each day as possible. If dosing was delayed, dosing could be taken up to 6 hours to make up for the missed 
one. The tablets should be taken with food and a glass (about 250 ml) of water, milk or juice. The tablets 
should be swallowed whole. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of darolutamide over placebo on MFS in 
patients with nmCRPC. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to demonstrate the benefit of darolutamide compared with 
placebo for Overall Survival (OS), time to pain progression, time to initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy 
for prostate cancer, and time to first Symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), and to characterise the safety and 
tolerability of darolutamide. 
The additional objectives of this study were to determine the benefit of darolutamide on PFS, time to first 
prostate cancer-related invasive procedure, time to initiation of first subsequent antineoplastic therapy; and 
to determine the effect of darolutamide on PSA progression and PSA response, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status deterioration, health-related Quality of Life (QoL); and to evaluate the PK 
of darolutamide and keto-darolutamide, and to explore possible relationships between exposure and safety 
and efficacy response. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was MFS defined as time between randomisation and evidence of metastasis or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvic  CT/MRI  and  nuclear  medicine  bone  scan  were  to  be  performed  at  screening 
(baseline)  and  every  16  weeks  until  confirmed  metastasis.  Absence  or  presence  of  metastasis  were  to  be 
confirmed by the independent blinded central reading during the double-blind treatment phase. Metastasis in 
bone was defined as appearance of 1 or more lesions that are confirmed by the central reading according to 
the one of the methods described below. If the central reading identifies changes on bone scan, confirmatory 
anatomic imaging CT/MRI or x-ray, of the area in question was to be obtained. Anatomic imaging performed 
up to 2 weeks prior to bone scan or later could be used as a confirmatory scan. Appearance of bone metastasis 
was to be assigned to the date of the bone scan at which the lesion was first identified. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 61/137 
  
  
  
 
Metastasis  in  non-osseous  tissue  was  defined  as  new  distant  pathologic  lymph  nodes  (M1a)  or  other 
pathological lesion (M1c) according to RECIST 1.1. New or progressive regional pathologic lymph nodes were 
not to be defined as metastasis. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of the study were: 
- OS, defined as time from randomisation to date of death from any cause.  
- Time to first SSE, defined as time from randomisation to the first occurrence of SSE (defined as occurrence 
of any of the following: external beam radiotherapy to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic 
pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or tumour related orthopaedic surgical intervention).  
- Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy is defined as time from randomisation to initiation of the first cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  
- Time to pain progression: Pain progression was defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline (day 1 
score) in question 3 of BPI-SF (related to the worst pain in the last 24 hours) taken as a 7-day average, or 
initiation of short or long-acting opioids for pain, whichever comes first. Pain was to be assessed with the 
BPI-SF questionnaire during the visit, pain diary entries from 6 days preceding the visit and opioid use from 
baseline until documented pain progression.  
The additional efficacy variables of the study were: 
- Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as time between randomisation and evidence of any radiographic 
disease progression, including new pathologic lymph nodes identified above or below the aortic bifurcation or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
- Time to first prostate cancer-related invasive procedure, defined as time from randomization to date of first 
prostate cancer-related invasive procedure. Prostate cancer-related invasive procedure was defined as any 
procedure needed for alleviation of symptoms, signs or findings caused by progression of prostate cancer 
(e.g. catheterisation of the bladder, percutaneous drainage of hydronephrosis, palliative electroresection of 
the prostate, etc.). 
- Time to initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, defined as time from randomization to initiation of 
first antineoplastic therapy. 
- Time to PSA progression, was defined as the time from randomization to the date of first PSA progression. 
PSA progression was defined as an increase of PSA of ≥25% and an absolute increase of PSA of ≥2 ng/ml 
above the nadir, which was confirmed by a consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later. PSA 
progression was only declared if observed at week 16 or later after randomization. 
The PSA progression definition deviated from PCWG2, as confirmation by a second value was requested for 
patients with no decline from baseline during treatment.  
- Percent of patients with PSA response 
The percentage change of PSA from baseline was to be calculated and the proportion of patients achieving a 
decline of ≥50% from baseline was to be determined. 
- Percent of patients with ECOG performance status deterioration, defined as an increase to grade 3 or 
higher, with an increase of at least 2 from baseline. 
- Time to ECOG performance status deterioration, as time from randomisation to ECOG performance status 
deterioration (an increase to grade 3 or higher, with an increase of at least 2 from baseline).

- Health-related QoL using FACT-P questionnaire, prostate cancer-specific subscale of the FACT-P 
questionnaire and generic EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. 
Disease-specific FACT-P questionnaire: FACT-P was to be assessed at screening, day 1, week 16, and at the 
end-of-study treatment visit. For placebo patients crossing over to open-label darolutamide treatment, FACT-
P was to be assessed at the start of open-label treatment instead of end-of-study treatment visit. Patients 
were to be defined as having total QoL deterioration, if they experienced a decrease of ≥ 10 points in FACT-P 
total score compared with baseline. The percent of patients experiencing deterioration in QoL from baseline 
based on the FACT-P total score at week 16 was to be determined. 
Prostate cancer-specific subscale of the FACT-P questionnaire (PCS subscale of FACT-P): PCS subscale was to 
be assessed at screening, day 1 and every 16 weeks until the end of the follow-up period, and at the end-of-
study treatment visit. For placebo patients crossing over to open-label darolutamide treatment, FACT-P was 
to be assessed at the start of open-label treatment instead of end-of-study treatment visit. Patients were to 
be defined as having QoL deterioration, if they experienced a change of ≥ 3 points in PCS compared with 
baseline (Cella D et al., 2009). 
Generic EQ-5D-3L questionnaire:  Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression were each assessed on 3-point categorical scales ranging from “no problem” to “severe 
problem”. EQ-5D-3L was to be assessed at screening, day 1, week 16, and at the end-of-study treatment 
visit to explore the impact of potential adverse effects on overall QoL. For placebo patients crossing over to 
open-label darolutamide, EQ-5D-3L was to be assessed at the start of open label treatment instead of end-of-
study treatment visit. If the end of the double-blind treatment period occurred less than 16 weeks from the 
start of study treatment, the EQ -5D-3L assessment was required in the first 16 weeks of open-label 
darolutamide treatment. Patients were to be considered to have deterioration in overall QoL, if they 
experienced a deterioration of ≥ 0.06 points compared with baseline. 
Sample size 
The initial sample size calculation for the ARAMIS study was updated following publication of results from the 
SPARTAN (apalutamide) and PROSPER (enzalutamide) phase III clinical trials and conduct of a central 
efficacy review of baseline radiological scans which identified some patients with metastases at baseline. The 
assumptions used to determine the final sample size for the primary endpoint of MFS were as follows: 
•  Overall type I error rate: 0.05 
•  Statistical power at the final analysis: 91% 
• 
Primary endpoint: MFS 
•  Median MFS for placebo: 25 months (based on denosumab phase III study results) 
•  Assumed hazard ratio of 0.65 
•  Diluted hazard ratio of 0.71 (accounting for presence of baseline metastases) 
•  Randomisation: 2:1 
385 MFS events was found to provide approximately 91% power to detect a statistically significant difference 
in MFS times, using a log-rank test with a two-sided 0.05 level of significance. Assuming 40 months’ accrual 
time and a dropout rate of 40%, the study was calculated to require approximately 1500 patients (1000 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 63/137 
  
  
  
 
darolutamide patients, 500 placebo patients) to achieve approximately 385 MFS events within a reasonable 
time. The sample size calculation was performed with a simulation-based algorithm. No sample size 
calculations were performed for the overall survival endpoint. 
Randomisation 
All eligible patients were randomised to receive darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo in a 2:1 ratio in a 
double-blind manner. Randomisation was stratified by PSA doubling time (PSADT; ≤ 6 months vs. > 6 
months) and use of osteoclast-targeted therapy (yes vs. no). 
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal study was a double blinded trial with a subsequent open label part. The double-blind part was 
planned to be continued until the total number of MFS events for primary analysis were reached (at about 
385 events). Patients in the placebo arm at the time of the planned study treatment code unblinding, were to 
be offered the opportunity to receive darolutamide through open-label treatment if there was a positive 
benefit/risk assessment at the primary analysis in favour of darolutamide 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomized patients. 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) was the primary population for safety analyses and included all patients who 
were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment. Patients in the SAF were grouped 
according to the treatment they actually received. 
Analysis of Primary and secondary efficacy endpoint 
The FAS population was used as the primary analysis population for all efficacy variables. Eligible patients were 
randomized and stratified by PSADT and use of osteoclast-targeted therapy. All efficacy analyses incorporated 
the stratification. Statistical testing was conducted to demonstrate the superiority of darolutamide vs. placebo 
in MFS. A stratified log-rank test was used to compare the darolutamide and placebo arms. The comparison 
was 2-sided at the 0.05 level of significance. For the primary efficacy endpoint, no formal interim analysis was 
planned. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results of the primary analysis of the 
MFS endpoint. The following sensitivity analyses were performed for MFS in the FAS: (1) censoring patients 
who died before documented metastasis; (2) considering all prohibited new treatment that started prior to 
documented metastasis as an event; (3) using stratification data from the case report from (CRF); (4) 
without including stratification factors in the model; (5) using MFS data based on investigator assessment; 
(6) considering all deaths independent of time of occurrence as MFS events; (7) using the event at the date 
of the first post-baseline scan with metastasis instead of event at randomization, for patients with baseline 
metastasis. If no metastasis was documented in post baseline scans, the patient was censored at the last 
available scan date. In case the patient did not have any post-baseline scans, the patient was censored at 
randomization. (8) excluding patients with the primary reason for permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment of “judgment of investigator” or “personal reason”, and without MFS events (post-hoc analysis) 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 64/137 
  
  
  
 
Sensitivity analyses 1-7 were also performed for MFS with baseline metastasis censored at randomization 
date. Different MFS censoring rules were to be used for the primary and secondary analyses of MFS for the 
United States and outside of the United States. For submissions outside of the United States the analysis with 
baseline metastasis censored (censored at date of randomization) was to be considered as primary analysis 
and the analysis with baseline metastasis as event (event at date of randomization) was to be considered as 
secondary analysis. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed in the FAS, and were tested hierarchically in the following 
order only if the primary endpoint MFS was significant: (1) Overall survival (OS), (2) Time to pain 
progression (TPP), (3) Time to initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer (CYTOC), (4) 
Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). All secondary endpoints OS, PP, CYTOC and SSE were to be 
tested sequentially two times, in case the previous endpoint in the hierarchical order was significant. The first 
test for statistical significance was to occur at the time of the MFS analysis and the final test for statistical 
significance was to occur when approximately 240 OS events have been observed.  
Regarding overall survival, patients not known to have died were censored at their last date of being known to 
be alive or at the database cut-off date, whichever came first. Patients lost to follow-up without contact after 
randomization were to be censored on the date of randomization. 
PFS  and  time  to  PSA  progression  were  analysed  with  the  same  methods  as  the  primary  variable  MFS.  PSA 
response rate was compared between treatment groups using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for 
the same stratification factors as for the primary endpoint MFS. 
For the PRO analyses, statistical tests were performed with a 2-sided type I error of 5%.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol, Version 1.0, was dated 10 March 2014. There were 3 major protocol amendments 
during the study which occurred prior to the primary analysis. 
First protocol amendment (Protocol amendment 1, Version 2.0, dated 24 November 2014) 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 66/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
PFS was added as an additional endpoint during the first protocol amendment to capture the development of 
local regional LN soft tissue metastasis.  
Soft tissue progression was clarified to exclude progression in lymph nodes in the pelvis below the aortic 
bifurcation which is more consistent with loco-regional progression and will not be defined as metastases. 
Patients with new pathologic lymph nodes identified in the pelvis below the aortic bifurcation could continue 
study treatment. 
Eligibility related to PSA was amended to allow patients with CRPC defined as 3 rising PSA values at least 1 
week apart during ADT to enter the study. 
Second protocol amendment (Version 3.0, dated 19 July 2016) 
The entry criteria were clarified in terms of CRPC definition and PSADT. Entry criteria was updated to clarify 
the inclusion criteria the required PSA value at screening of ≥2 ng/ml is required.  
The time periods for detecting metastases by blinded central reading or a metastatic disease were specified. 
Detection of all new suspected metastases on CT/MRI scan at soft tissues/visceral level should be confirmed 
by central review as is done for bone lesions. 
Third protocol amendment (Version 4.0, dated 26 February 2018) 
The option of an open label part of the study after the primary analysis with a positive benefit/risk was 
submitted during this amendment to allow patients in the placebo arm to cross over to receive darolutamide. 
Patients would still be followed up as per the blinded part with imaging every 16 weeks but only have local 
radiological imaging review. 
Protocol deviations 
Table 13: Number of patients with protocol deviations (FAS) 
Deviations from the pre-specified statistical analysis plan in the CSR 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 67/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
The definition of PSA progression as per SAP v.4.2 (defined according to the consensus guidelines of the 
PCWG2) was updated to achieve consistency with the relevant guidelines.  
The analysis where baseline metastasis according to independent efficacy review is considered as an event 
was presented as the primary MFS analysis for the US and non US-submission while the SAP v4.2 stated that 
for submissions outside of the US the analysis with baseline metastasis censored at date of randomization 
would be considered the primary MFS analysis.

At baseline reviewers were instructed to document seemingly abnormal lymph nodes that were ≥15 mm in 
the short axis according to RECIST 1.1 and follow them for regional progression. Therefore, lymph nodes 
were regarded as pathological if ≥15 mm and were included in the baseline regional LN count.  
The majority of patients had no regional pathological LNs at baseline. However, on retrospective/post hoc 
analysis of the baseline imaging during the efficacy review (performed by a separate group of independent 
central radiologists), 5.2% of patients in the darolutamide arm and 7.0% of patients in the placebo arm were 
retrospectively classified with metastases despite distant metastasis listed in the exclusion criteria.  
Patients with a medical history of seizure were allowed to enter the study. There were 12 patients (0.21%) 
enrolled on the darolutamide arm with a history of seizure.

Time to PSA Progression and Percent of patients with PSA response 
The median PSA progression in the darolutamide arm was 33.15 months versus 7.33 months in the placebo 
arm with a HR of 0.130 [0.109; 0.156] favouring darolutamide. There was a smaller proportion of patients in 
the darolutamide arm (23.7%) compared to the placebo arm (66.4%) with PSA progression.  
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 83/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier curves of time to PSA progression (FAS) 
Patients receiving darolutamide in the ARAMIS study demonstrated a significantly higher confirmed PSA 
response rate (defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline), compared with patients receiving placebo, 
83.6% vs 7.6% (difference = 76%, p<0.000001). 
Health-related QoL 
The percent of patients with a deterioration of FACT-P total score at 16 weeks was similar in the darolutamide 
arm (17.5%; 95% CI: [15.1%; 20.0%]) compared to the placebo arm (21.1%; 95% CI: [17.8%; 24.8%]). 
The difference in deterioration rate was 3.45 (95% CI: [-0.72%; 7.62%], p=0.099804). The difference in 
deterioration rate was below the meaningfully important difference (MID) threshold of 10, and the results 
imply that HRQoL was similarly maintained up to 16 weeks between the treatment arms. At baseline, mean 
total scores were similar between the treatment arms. Small changes in mean values from baseline for the 
total score and subscores were observed in both treatment arms, but there were no clinically meaningful 
differences (MID of 3 for Physical Well Being, Social/Family Well Being, Emotional Well Being, Functional Well 
Being, Prostate Cancer Symptoms; MID of 7 for FACT-G total; MID of 10 for FACT-P total; MID of 9 for Trial 
Outcome Index) between the treatment arms at any of the time points. 
The ANCOVA analyses of time-adjusted AUC showed that for all subscales the results favoured darolutamide 
(higher scores represent better HRQoL). Even though some results were statistically significant, none of the 
differences in LS means between the treatment arms crossed the MID thresholds, implying that HRQoL was 
similarly maintained throughout the study for the FACT-P total score and subscores. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 84/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
At baseline, mean PCS subscale scores were similar between the treatment arms. General decreases in mean 
values from baseline for PCS subscale scores were observed in both treatment arms, but there were no 
clinically meaningful differences (MID = 3) between the treatment arms at any of the time points. 
Deterioration in PCS subscore was observed for 61.8% of the patients in the darolutamide arm and 63.9% of 
the patients in the placebo arm. The times to deterioration in PCS subscore were longer in the darolutamide 
arm than in the placebo arm, with a median time to deterioration in PCS subscore of 11.07 months (95% CI: 
[11.04, 11.14]) in the darolutamide arm compared with 7.88 months (95% CI: [7.46, 11.07]) in the placebo 
arm, which is a benefit of 3.19 months for darolutamide14. A treatment effect in favour of darolutamide with 
respect to time to deterioration in PCS was observed, with a HR of 0.796 (95% CI: [0.697, 0.908]) and a 
two-sided p-value of 0.000517. 
Completion rates of the EORTC-QLQ-PR25 were comparable between the treatment arms. The percent of 
patients with improvement of urinary symptoms was higher in the darolutamide arm (46.4%; 95% CI: 
[43.2%; 49.6%]) compared to the placebo arm (34.8%; 95% CI: [30.9%; 39.0%]), with a difference in in 
improvement rate of -11.35 (95% CI: [-16.44%; -6.26%], p=0.000018). 
Changes in mean values for EORTC-QLQ-PR25 urinary symptoms scores over time favour darolutamide 
(higher scores represent greater symptom impact) at most time points. 
At baseline, EORTC-QLQ-PR25 urinary symptoms scores were similar between the treatment arms. Changes 
in mean values from baseline for the urinary symptoms scores were observed in both treatment arms and 
favoured darolutamide, but there were no clinically meaningful differences (MID = 8) in the urinary 
symptoms score at any of the time points. 
The urinary symptom score results favoured darolutamide and were statistically significant but were not 
clinically meaningful, as the difference in LS means between the treatment arms did not meet the MID 
threshold. 
Worsening of urinary symptoms based on the EORTC-QLQ-PR25 questionnaire was observed for 43.6% of the 
patients in the darolutamide arm and 51.1% of the patients in the placebo arm. The times to worsening of 
urinary symptoms were longer in the darolutamide arm than in the placebo arm, with a median time of 14.78 
months (95% CI: [14.52, 18.43]) in the darolutamide arm compared with 7.62 months (95% CI: [7.39, 
11.04]) in the placebo arm, which is a benefit of 7.16 months for darolutamide. A treatment effect in favour 
of darolutamide with respect to time to worsening of urinary symptoms was observed with a HR of 0.619 
(95% CI: [0.530, 0.721]) and a two-sided p-value of <0.000001. 
Completion rates of the EQ-5D-3L were comparable between the treatment arms. The percent of patients 
with deterioration of EQ-5D-3L index score at 16 weeks was similar in the darolutamide arm (21.9%; 95% 
CI: [19.3%; 24.6%]) compared to the placebo arm (24.5%; 95% CI [21.0%; 28.4%]), with a difference in 
deterioration rate of 2.47 (95% CI: [-1.99%; 6.93%]; p=0.272198). 
At baseline, the EQ-5D-3L index score and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were similar between the 
treatment arms. Small changes in mean values from baseline for both scores were observed in both 
treatment arms, but there were no clinically meaningful differences (MID = 0.1 for Index Score and 7 for 
VAS) between the treatment arms at any of the time points. 
The index score and VAS score results slightly favoured darolutamide (higher scores represent better HRQoL) 
but were not statistically significant and were not clinically meaningful, as they did not meet the MID 
thresholds.

Completion rates of the BPI-SF were comparable between the treatment arms. At baseline (visit 1, day 1), 
BPI-SF pain severity and pain interference scores were similar between the treatment arms. Changes in 
mean values from baseline for the pain severity and pain interference scores were observed in both 
treatment arms, but there were no clinically meaningful differences (MID = 2 points) between the treatment 
arms at any of the time points. 
The pain interference score and pain severity score results favoured darolutamide (lower scores represent 
less pain) and were statistically significant but were not clinically meaningful, as the difference in least 
squares (LS) mean between the treatment arms did not meet the MID threshold (MID = 2 points).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The proposed recommended dose of darolutamide for the treatment of nmCRPC is 600 mg (2 x 300 mg 
tablet) b.i.d., equal to a total daily dose of 1200 mg. The tablets should be taken whole with food. If a dose is 
missed, the dose should be taken as soon as the patient remembers prior to the next scheduled dose. The 
patient should not take two doses together to make up for a missed dose. The recommended dose was 
determined based on clinical results from studies in the darolutamide clinical development program, 
especially study 17829 (ARADES) and study 17830 (ARAFOR) which were conducted in mCRPC patients. This 
was further supported by the exposure-PSA analysis in mCRPC and nmCRPC patients (study 19792) and non-
clinical data. The dose is considered adequately justified.

The  pivotal  study  17712  (ARAMIS)  was  designed  with  two  main  components:  a  double  blinded  part  and  an 
open  label  part  which  was  introduced  during  the  3rd  (and  last)  protocol  amendment  prior  to  the  primary 
analysis to allow patients in the placebo arm to cross over to active darolutamide treatment. This type of cross 
over can confound the overall survival results which will need to be considered when final results are provided. 
The comparator in this study is a placebo which is considered acceptable in this disease setting considering 
apalutamide and enzalutamide were not yet authorised at the time the study was started. Darolutamide is 
intended for patients who are only considered high risk for developing metastasis. This is appropriate given 
the impact metastasis, in particular symptomatic metastasis will have on a patient’s long-term survival and 
quality of life. High risk nmCRPC was defined as a short PSA doubling time (PSADT) of ≤ 10 months and PSA 
≥ 2 ng/mL at baseline screening which is acceptable.  
The primary endpoint was MFS which is considered an acceptable endpoint in this particular disease setting as 
patients have a prolonged disease course. CHMP Scientific advice on the clinical development programme and 
the pivotal study design was obtained in 2013 specifically on the definition of nmCRPC who are at high risk of 
developing  metastasis,  the  use  of  MFS  as  an  endpoint,  the  statistical  plan  and  dose  recommendation.  The 
applicant was advised that the events (i.e. metastases) should include both bone and soft tissue metastases 
and that radiographic progression should be based on RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
There were four secondary endpoints which captured important clinical settings in the management of 
patients with this disease: Overall survival (OS), Time to pain progression, Time to initiation of first cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for prostate cancer and  Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). PFS and PSA-related 
endpoints were selected as tertiary and exploratory endpoints. The applicant has provided an adequate 
justification for including PFS as an exploratory endpoint because in the context of nmCRPC, assessing the 
occurrence of distant metastases assessed by an MFS endpoint is more relevant as they are the main 
contributors to illness and death.  
The study established a steering committee and an independent data and safety monitoring board. The 
overall design of the trial in terms of blinding, randomisation 2:1, stratification, inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There were 2696 patients enrolled in the study of which 44.0% were discontinued from screening. A total of 
1509 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: darolutamide 
(955 patients) or placebo (554 patients). Of the randomized patients, 99.9% of the patients in the 
darolutamide arm and 100% of the patients in the placebo arm received at least one dose of study drug. One 
patient was randomized to the darolutamide arm but never received treatment. 
The study protocol was amended 3 times prior to the primary analysis. Protocol amendment 2 dated July 2016 
clarified  the  entry  criteria  further  in  terms  of  CRPC  definition  and  PSADT  and  is  not  considered  to  have  an 
impact on the overall study results. 
The number of protocol deviations was high. It was clarified that any misunderstanding of study procedures by 
the site team or a patient as well as missing or accidental use of wrong forms, samples or procedures outside 
of the allowed time window were reported as protocol deviations and represent the high number of deviations. 
There  was  1  major  protocol  deviation  which  occurred  in  the  darolutamide  arm  whereby  one  patient  was 
randomised  and  never  received  treatment.  The  deviations  classified  as  important  were  evenly  distributed 
amongst the two arms. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 95/137 
  
  
  
 
The median age in both treatment arms was 74.0 years, with most patients being in the age groups of 65-74 
years old and 75-84 years old. In the total study population, patients were predominantly white (79.1%), with 
12.8% of patients identifying as Asian, 3.4% as black or African American, and 3.1% as Hispanic or Latino.  
The median PSA values at baseline were similar between the treatment arms, 9.030 ng/mL and 9.670 ng/mL 
in the darolutamide and placebo arm. The median time since initial diagnosis to the start of study treatment 
was 86.15 months in the darolutamide arm and 84.23 months in the placebo arm. The median time from first 
prior  ADT  treatment,  including  GnRH  agonist/antagonists,  orchiectomy,  antiandrogens,  to  start  of  study 
treatment was similar in both treatment arms.  
The  baseline  cancer  characteristics  show  that  there  was  a  baseline  presence  of  regional  pathological  lymph 
nodes  by  central  imaging  review  in  both  treatment  groups.  163  (17.1%)  in  the  darolutamide  arm  and  158 
(28.5%) in the placebo arm. 
A total of 89 patients were identified by the second review pool to have metastatic disease at baseline 
retrospectively (post hoc analysis of the baseline images). These patients were previously considered eligible 
by radiology pool 1. The primary MFS analysis included the 89 patients with baseline metastases, counting 
them as events at randomization. 
Prior to being diagnosed as castrate resistant, the types of initial radical treatment received were balanced in 
both  arms.  However,  given  that  the  median  age of  patients  was  74  years in both  arms  with  nearly  50%  of 
patients in the darolutamide arm ≥75 years, the number of patients receiving radiotherapy (18.5 % vs 16.1%) 
as an option for curative intent seems lower than what is expected in clinical practice. In both arms, the majority 
of patients received chemical castration with approximately a quarter of patients undergoing surgery. While 
active  surveillance  is  an  option  for  men  with  low  risk  disease  and  watchful  waiting  with  delayed  hormone 
therapy can be an option for men unsuitable for radical treatment, in general, primary ADT is not recommended 
as standard initial treatment of non-metastatic disease. It was clarified that 58.8% of the patients received 
upfront definitive local therapy based on the information in the CRF. 
38/954 (3.8%) patients in the darolutamide arm and 28/554 (5.1%) in the placebo arm were receiving either 
a bisphosphonate or denosumab at study entry. Among patients without osteoclast-target therapy at baseline, 
the reported use of osteoclast targeted therapy was 2% in patients in ARAMIS study. 
The imbalance observed between the two arms for patients who discontinued without documented 
metastases as well as without an MFS event (76/955 (7.9%) in the darolutamide arm and 111/554 (20%) in 
the placebo arm) was principally related to the higher number of patients in the placebo arm who 
discontinued the study treatment due to the investigator judgement and personal reasons. 
According to the ARAMIS clinical study protocol, a patient could continue to receive treatment until 
metastasis was confirmed by the central review. It was noted that 356 patients (168 in the darolutamide arm 
and 188 in the placebo arm) have continued to receive treatment beyond metastasis which is a violation of 
the treatment duration defined in the protocol. These patients were identified centrally during an ongoing 
central review process called “rolling reads”. The interval period between the centralised confirmation of 
metastasis (CoM) and last exposure to study drug varied amongst participants with no discernible trend from 
1 day to 337 days. The applicant has provided a justification for the delay whereby the CoM process could 
take time due to scan related queries prior to radiological confirmation and scheduling an appointment to 
inform the patient of their disease progression. 
Results from the pivotal study demonstrated a significant treatment effect for MFS with a hazard ratio of 
0.413 (95% CI: [0.341; 0.500]; p<0.000001) representing a 58.7% reduction in the risk of metastases or 
EMA/84124/2020

death in the darolutamide arm compared with the placebo arm. The median MFS was 40.37 months in the 
darolutamide arm compared to 18.43 months in the placebo arm, which is a clinically meaningful difference 
of 21.94 months in favour of darolutamide. The event-free rates at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 months demonstrate 
that the benefit of darolutamide treatment with regard to MFS was maintained over time. Importantly a 
statistically significant MFS result is maintained when baseline metastasis is censored. All sensitivity analyses 
were consistent with the results of the primary analysis of MFS and supported superiority of darolutamide 
over placebo. 
Moreover, while all participants were classified as high risk, the treatment benefit presented for darolutamide 
in the subgroup analysis did not depend on prostate cancer specific prognostic features for example baseline 
PSA value, PSADT or Gleason score at diagnosis. There was also a treatment benefit with darolutamide 
across all ages, if there were regional pathological LNs present at baseline and if patients received ≥2 lines of 
hormonal therapies prior to starting darolutamide.  
For race/ethnicity, a higher incidence (60% more often) and mortality rates of prostate cancer have been 
reported in African American male population compared to Caucasian American males. Due to low patient 
numbers and event counts, the CIs were wide for the subgroups ‘Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino’ (N = 47, N 
with event = 14) and ‘Race: Other’ (N = 15, N with event = 5), thus the results for these subgroups have to 
be interpreted with caution. 
Overall, secondary endpoints (OS, time to pain progression, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and time to first 
symptomatic skeletal event) showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. At the time of primary 
analysis for MFS, 136 OS events had occurred out of the planned 240 events for the final analysis. Despite 
the low number of events presented, treatment with darolutamide does not negatively impact OS with a HR 
of 0.706. The median was not reached in either treatment arm. The available immature OS data have not 
shown a detrimental effect which is reassuring. To further investigate the efficacy of darolutamide in this 
setting, the applicant will provide the final clinical study report including the results of the final analysis for 
OS by 30 June 2020 (PAES, Annex II). 
Time to pain progression translated as a difference of 14.95 months in favour of the darolutamide arm. In 
general patients are asymptomatic at this point from their disease and therefore should be essentially pain 
free at baseline from their prostate cancer specifically an opiate naive. 
Time to initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy is considered particularly noteworthy given the fact that 
PFS2 has not been formally analysed in this pivotal study. In terms of events, only 73/955 (7.6%) in the 
darolutamide arm and 79/554 (14.3%) in the placebo arm had occurred at the time of primary analysis. Time 
to initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy excluding cytotoxic chemotherapy was also assessed as an 
additional endpoint and a post-hoc analysis of subsequent antineoplastic therapy and/or cytotoxic 
chemotherapy in patients who discontinued study treatment was performed. Delaying the initiation of 
subsequent therapies for metastasis and opiate analgesia to control cancer related pain are relevant for the 
management of nmCRPC. 
Time to first symptomatic skeletal event captures 4 clinically important presentations which are relevant to 
efficacy but also the management of patients with prostate cancer; palliative radiotherapy for bone 
metastasis, spinal cord compression, orthopaedic surgical intervention, new pathological bone fracture. 
Because of the low number of events at the time of analysis, a statistically significant difference has not been 
demonstrated however there is a positive trend in favour of darolutamide. 
There were additional objectives to the pivotal study which determined the benefit of darolutamide for 
progression free survival, time to first prostate cancer related invasive procedure and time to initiation of first 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 97/137 
  
  
  
 
subsequent antineoplastic therapy along with objectives to determine the effect of darolutamide on PSA 
progression and response, ECOG performance status deterioration and health related QoL. There was a delay 
in PSA progression, PFS and time to initiation of subsequent therapies in the patients who received 
darolutamide. The median PFS in the darolutamide arm was 36.83 months versus 14.82 months in the 
placebo arm with a HR of 0.380. Evaluating the QoL is crucial because of patient’s good performance status 
prior to receiving treatment. QoL was not impaired and the delay of time to deterioration in post hoc analysis 
could be translated as an improvement in patients QoL compared to placebo. 
Overall, the data presented for the secondary and additional exploratory objectives while encouraging, are 
too immature to draw any firm conclusions. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall the pivotal study ARAMIS met its primary endpoint which demonstrated a statistically significant benefit 
in terms of MFS for patients with non-metastatic CRPC. The use of darolutamide demonstrates an important 
delay in the onset of distant metastases, which appears to be supported by secondary endpoints for the time 
being. The final clinical study report, including update on OS and other secondary endpoints, is warranted to 
further investigate the benefit of this treatment.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of darolutamide in adult men with non-metastatic castration 
resistant prostate cancer who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease, the MAH should submit the 
final study report, including updated OS results, from study ARAMIS 17712. Due date: 30 June 2020 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Four separate data sources contribute to the analyses of clinical safety for darolutamide (see also Table 17): 
1.  Pivotal study 17712 (nmCRPC), darolutamide arm N=954 (primary analysis of safety) 
2.  mCRPC pool, N=173: pooled analysis of four uncontrolled Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients (Study 17829 (ARADES), Study 18035 
(ARADES-EXT), Study 17830 (ARAFOR) and Study 17719). 
3.  Non-cancer subjects pool: single dose N=56, multiple dose N=45 
4.  Ongoing blinded study 17777 (mHSPC), darolutamide arm N ~ estimated 650 patients 
In  the  pivotal  study  17712  ARAMIS  treatment  exposure  was  longer  in  the  darolutamide  arm  months  (14.8 
months [range: <0.1 to 44.3 months]) versus the placebo arm (11.0 months [range: 0.1 to 40.5 months]). 
More than half of patients in the darolutamide arm (51.7% darolutamide vs 36.8% placebo) received treatment 
>12 months to </= 30 months. The percentage receiving treatment beyond 30 months was also higher in the 
darolutamide arm (9.1%) than in the placebo arm (3.2%). More than 500 patients in the darolutamide arm in 
study  17712  were  treated  for  >12  months.  As  of  the  cut-off  date  3  September  2018,  64.4%  of  patients  in 
darolutamide arm vs 36.1% patients in placebo arm were still receiving treatment. The most common reason 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 98/137 
  
  
  
 
for treatment discontinuation in both arms was confirmed metastasis (11.7% in darolutamide arm vs 23.3% 
in placebo arm). The numbers who discontinued due to an AE was relatively similar between both arms (8.9% 
in darolutamide arm vs 8.7% in placebo).

Most common drug-related TEAEs  
Overall, TEAEs that were assessed as drug-related by the investigator occurred in 27.0% of patients in the 
darolutamide arm and in 19.9% of patients in the placebo arm in study 17712. Drug-related events that were 
reported in ≥2% of patients in the darolutamide or placebo treatment arms, respectively, included fatigue 
(7.1% vs. 4.3%), hot flush (3.8% vs. 2.7%) and nausea (2.5% vs. 3.1%).  
Adverse Events of Grade 3 or 4 
Overall, events with grade 3 as the worst grade were reported in 22.5% of patients in darolutamide arm and 
17.9% of patients in placebo arm. Of the Grade 3 TEAEs, hypertension was the most common event in both 
treatment arms with an incidence of 3.1% and 2.2% in the darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively. Grade 
3 urinary retention and haematuria were more commonly reported in the placebo arm than darolutamide arm. 
For Grade 4 TEAEs, overall incidence was low, 2.2% of patients in darolutamide arm and 1.6% of patients in 
placebo arm respectively. Of TEAEs with Grade 4 as worst grade, acute myocardial infarction, hyperglycaemia, 
ischemic stroke and respiratory failure occurred in 0.2% of patients each (n=2), with no corresponding events 
reported in the placebo arm. 
Grade 3 was the worst grade of drug-related TEAEs in 2.5% of patients in both treatment arms. The incidences 
of drug-related hypertension (0.4% vs. 0.5%) and fatigue (0.2% vs. 0.2%) with worst grade of 3 were similar 
between darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively. In the darolutamide arm, drug-related events with worst 
grade of 3 of AST increased and neutrophil count decreased were both reported in 0.3% of patients, and ALT 
increased, hyponatremia, and neutropenia were reported in 0.2% of patients each in the darolutamide arm. 
No respective events occurred in the placebo arm.  
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 104/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
Grade 4 was the worst grade of drug-related TEAEs in 3 patients (0.3%) in the darolutamide arm and included 
abnormal hepatic function, ischemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism. No drug-related events with worst grade 
of 4 were observed in the placebo arm. 
Analysis of Special topics

Bone fracture 
Treatment emergent events concerning bone fracture were observed with a small difference between the 
darolutamide and placebo arms (4.19% vs. 3.61%, respectively). When adjusted for the difference in 
treatment duration between the treatment arms, the rates were 3.0 vs. 3.5 per 100 PY, respectively, with an 
incidence risk ratio of 0.85 for darolutamide/placebo. Of note, there was also 1 patient in the placebo group 
(0.2%) who had pathological fracture (not part of the grouped term). 
Fractures were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in most patients. Fractures with worst grade of 
3 were reported in 0.9% of patients in both treatment arms. 
The events were considered serious in 0.8% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 1.1% of patients in 
the placebo arm. One patient (0.2%) in the placebo arm discontinued study treatment permanently due to a 
fracture event (grade 3 facial bones fracture). Fracture led to dose interruption in 1 patient in both the 
darolutamide (0.1%) and placebo arms (0.2%). No dose reductions were reported due to fracture events. 
At study entry, the use of osteoclast-targeted therapy was reported only for 3.8% and 5.1% of patients in 
the darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively. 
At study entry a similar proportion of patients received bone sparing agents in darolutamide and placebo 
arms (123 patients, 12.9% vs. 72 patients, 13.0%, respectively). Drugs included in the bone sparing agents 
category were selected based on ATC codes and include drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization 
(such as bisphosphonates and denosumab), vitamin D and analogues, calcium and calcium combinations, 
fluorides and calcitonins. Altogether 38 of the 123 patients in the darolutamide arm and 28 of the 72 patients 
in the placebo arm received bisphosphonates or denosumab. The remaining patients received drugs from the 
other categories (vitamin D and analogues, calcium and calcium combinations, fluorides and calcitonins). 
A total of 4.0% and 2.7% of patients in the darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively, had a fracture 
event during the study but did not receive bone sparing agents while 0.2% and 0.9% of patients had a 
fracture event and received bone sparing agents. Per protocol, the use of osteoclast-targeted therapy was 
allowed for the treatment of osteoporosis and was reported for 3.8% and 5.1% of patients at randomization, 
respectively. Osteoclast targeted therapy was collected in the CRF as a stratification factor and no specific 
drug names were identified.  
No differences were observed between the treatment arms in the cumulative incidence of fractures. 
There was a comparable distribution of weight changes in patients with bone fractures in both treatment 
arms. This result indicates that the risk of fractures does not correlate with a decrease of body weight in 
patients in either treatment arm. Events of decreased weight were reported in 3.56% of patients in the 
darolutamide arm and in 2.17% in the placebo arm. 
Fall 
Treatment-emergent event of ‘fall’ as a single MedDRA PT was reported in 3.8% of patients in the 
darolutamide arm and 4.2% of patients in the placebo arm. 
The events of fall were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in most patients and thus were minor 
with no resultant injuries or symptomatic with non invasive intervention needed. Fall with worst grade of 3 
(the highest grade for fall per CTCAE) was reported at a similar level in both darolutamide and placebo arms 
(0.8% vs. 0.7%, respectively). 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 106/137 
  
  
  
 
SAE of fall was reported in 0.3% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 0.2% in the placebo arm. No 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to fall were reported. The dose was 
interrupted in 1 patient (0.2%) in the placebo arm as a result of fall. No dose reductions were required. 
After review of the data, the MedDRA search term was extended to include also the MedDRA PT ‘accident’ by 
the SAP supplement 1.0, since for all cases of ‘accident’ the reported term was fall. After this modification, 
fall event as a grouped term was reported in 4.19% and 4.69% of patients in the darolutamide and placebo 
arms, respectively. 
One patient in the placebo arm experienced an accidental fall and syncope (reported terms) on the same day 
during the study treatment period. 
Fatigue/asthenic conditions 
Treatment-emergent events of fatigue/asthenic conditions were reported in 15.83% of patients in the 
darolutamide arm and in 11.37% of patients in the placebo arm.  
Fatigue (not including asthenia, lethargy or malaise) occurred in the majority of patients (12.1% of patients 
treated with darolutamide and 8.7% of patients treated with placebo). 
When adjusted for the difference in treatment duration, the incidence of fatigue/asthenic conditions in 
patients treated with darolutamide was similar to those receiving placebo (11.3 vs. 11.1 per 100 PY, 
respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.02) 
Events of fatigue/asthenic conditions were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in most patients. 
Events with worst grade of 3 were reported in 0.6% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 1.1% in the 
placebo arm. 
The event was considered serious in 1 patient in the darolutamide arm (grade 3 asthenia). Events of 
fatigue/asthenic conditions resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation in 0.3% and 0.2% of patients in 
the darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively. Events led to dose interruption in 0.3% vs. 0.7% of 
patients, respectively; and to dose reduction in 0.8% vs. 0.5% of patients 
The interval-specific incidence of asthenic conditions was comparable between the darolutamide and placebo 
arms with the highest values observed within the first month of treatment (4.5% in darolutamide and 2.8% 
in placebo) abating after the first year of exposure. A slightly higher incidence within the first 16 weeks was 
observed in the darolutamide arm. 
The prevalence rate of asthenic conditions reached the highest values in both treatment arms within the first 
year, abating afterwards faster in placebo arm. The prevalence rate was consistently higher in the 
darolutamide than in the placebo treatment arm, showing a difference of 1.6 to 2.9 percentage points during 
the first year of the exposure. 
Weight decreased 
Treatment-emergent events of weight decreased were reported in 3.56% of patients in the darolutamide arm 
and in 2.17% of patients in the placebo arm. When adjusted for the difference in treatment duration between 
the treatment arms, the incidence was similar in patients treated with darolutamide compared to those 
receiving placebo (2.5 vs. 2.1 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.21) 
All events were reported with worst grade of 1 (2.3% vs. 1.8%) or grade 2 (1.3% vs. 0.4%) in both 
darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 107/137 
  
  
  
 
No SAEs or events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were reported in either arm. Dose 
interruption and dose reduction due to decreased weight was required in 1 patient each (0.2%) in the 
placebo arm. 
No differences were observed between the treatment arms in the changes of mean values over time for body 
weight. 
Seizure 
The pre-clinical and clinical data for darolutamide did not indicate any pro-convulsive potential as 
darolutamide might have low penetration of the blood brain barrier. Therefore, patients with a history of 
seizure were allowed to enter the study 17712. Overall, 12 patients in the darolutamide arm had a history of 
seizure (MLG seizures) including 2 patients (0.2%) with seizure and 10 patients (1.0%) with epilepsy. One 
patient in the placebo arm (0.2%) was reported with post-traumatic epilepsy ongoing at screening. 
The incidence of seizure events reported during the study treatment was similar in both treatment arms. The 
events were reported for 2 patients (0.21%) in the darolutamide arm and for 1 patient (0.18%) in the 
placebo arm. None of the patients with a medical history of seizure experienced a TEAE of seizure in the 
darolutamide arm. 
Seizures were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2 in both treatment arms. The events occurring in the 
darolutamide arm were reported as SAEs. No treatment discontinuations, interruptions or reductions were 
required due to seizure event in either arm. 
Rash 
Overall, treatment-emergent events of rash were reported more commonly in patients treated with 
darolutamide than in those who received placebo (2.94% vs. 0.90%, respectively) with an event rate of 2.1 
vs. 0.9 per 100 PY (incidence risk ratio of 2.38) after adjusting for the difference in treatment duration 
between the treatment arms. 
Rash events were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2 in severity in all but 1 darolutamide treated patient 
(0.1%), who had rash with worst grade of 3 during the study. 
No SAEs or permanent study treatment discontinuations due to rash events were reported. Dose 
interruptions due to rash, rash maculopapular and rash pustular were reported in 1 patient each (0.1%) in 
the darolutamide arm. Dose reduction was required in 1 patient with rash (0.1%) in the darolutamide arm. 
No dose modifications due to rash events were reported in the placebo arm. 
At the PT level, the main contributor for the observed difference between the treatment arms was the 
unspecific term rash which was reported in 1.8% vs. 0.7% of patients in the darolutamide and placebo arms, 
respectively. This was followed by rash maculo-papular (0.4% vs. 0%). Other terms were reported at even 
lower levels in both treatment arms. 
Cardiovascular disorders  
Cardiac disorders  
The overall incidence of TEAEs in the SOC cardiac disorders was higher in the darolutamide arm compared to 
placebo arm (11.8% vs. 7.4%, respectively). 
The difference was observed across all grades, except for grade 5 TEAEs where the incidence was comparable 
in the darolutamide arm (1.0% vs. 1.4%, respectively). The overall mortality rate of patients in the study 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 108/137 
  
  
  
 
with reported cause ‘cardiovascular disease’ was comparable between the darolutamide and placebo arms 
(1.9% vs. 2.0%, respectively). 
TEAEs in the MedDRA HLGTs cardiac arrhythmias (6.71% vs. 3.97%), coronary artery disorders (3.25% vs. 
2.53%), and heart failures (1.89% vs. 0.90%) represented the key contributors to the overall count on the 
SOC level and to the disproportion between darolutamide and placebo treatment arms. 
Cardiac arrhythmias 
Within the HLGT cardiac arrhythmias, the HLTs cardiac conduction disorders (0.94% darolutamide vs. 0.36% 
placebo), rate and rhythm disorders NEC (3.35% vs. 1.08%), and supraventricular arrhythmias (3.04% vs. 
1.62%) mainly contributed to the overall count and to the disproportion on the HLGT level. 
The majority of the events were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2. The most common PTs were atrial 
fibrillation (2.3% vs. 1.4%), arrhythmia (1.5% vs. 0.5%) and bradycardia (1.0% vs. 0.2%). No difference 
between the darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively, was observed for HLT ventricular arrhythmias and 
cardiac arrest (0.6% vs.0.9%).  
For analysis of cardiac arrhythmias, the ECG data analysis was considered in addition to the TEAE analysis. In 
the Phase 1/2 studies in mCRPC patients, no notable changes from baseline in any of the ECG parameters 
nor dose dependent increases in PR or QTc intervals were observed. 
A dedicated analysis of the potential effect of darolutamide on cardiac repolarization performed in a subset of 
study 17712 did not show any clinically relevant effect on cardiac repolarization (QTc). 
Coronary artery disorders and heart failures 
The HLGT coronary artery disorders is represented by the HLT coronary artery disorders NEC (1.36% vs. 
0.54%) and the HLT ischemic coronary artery disorders (2.52% vs. 1.99%). The majority of the events 
within the HLGT coronary artery disorders were reported with worst grade of 3 or higher in the darolutamide 
arm. The most frequent PTs were coronary artery disease (1.0% vs. 0.2%) and angina pectoris (1.3% vs. 
0.7%). 
The HLGT heart failures contains one HLT heart failures NEC which is mainly represented by a PT cardiac 
failure (1.4% vs. 0.9%). 
Ischaemic heart disease  
Ischaemic heart disease occurred in 3.2% of patients treated with darolutamide and in 2.5% of patients 
treated with placebo. Grade 5 events occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with darolutamide and 0.2% of 
patients treated with placebo.  
Cerebrovascular disorders 
TEAEs were reported at a similar level in the HLGT CNS vascular disorders in the darolutamide arm (1.68%) 
compared to placebo arm (1.81%). TEAEs in the grouped terms of cerebral ischemia (1.36% vs. 1.44%) and 
cerebral and intracranial haemorrhage (0.21% vs. 0.36%) did not occur at a higher incidence in darolutamide 
arm. 
The cause of death was reported as ‘cerebrovascular disease’ in 0.2% vs. 0.9% of patients in the 
darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively. 
Hypertension 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 109/137 
  
  
  
 
The reported PTs for the MLG ‘hypertension’ included blood pressure increased, blood pressure systolic 
increased, essential hypertension, and hypertension. 
Treatment-emergent events of hypertension occurred in 7.34% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 
5.96% of patients in the placebo arm. The incidence was similar between darolutamide and placebo arms 
(5.2 vs. 5.8 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 0.90) after adjusting for the duration of 
treatment. 
Hypertension with grade 3 as the worst grade was experienced by 3.4% and 2.3% of patients in the 
darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively (reported mostly as PT ‘hypertension’). No grade 4 events of 
hypertension were reported. 
Interval-specific and cumulative event rates and prevalence rates for hypertension events did not reveal any 
meaningful differences between the treatment arms. 
No notable differences between the treatment arms were observed in the mean and median blood pressure 
measurement values over time.  
Vasodilatation and flushing 
The reported PTs for the MLG ‘vasodilatation and flushing’ included flushing and hot flush. Events of 
vasodilatation and flushing were reported in 5.66% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 4.15% of 
patients in the placebo arm. The results were comparable between darolutamide and placebo arms (4.0 
vs. 4.1 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.0) after adjusting for the difference in 
treatment duration. 
While no meaningful differences were seen in the cumulative incidence of these events a slight difference was 
noted in the interval incidence and prevalence rates in favour of the placebo arm.  
No permanent treatment discontinuations due to flushing or hot flushes were observed in the study. 
Treatment interruption due to flushing was reported in 1 patient (0.1%) and dose reduction due to hot flush 
in 2 patients (0.2%) in the darolutamide arm. 
Diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia 
No differences were observed in the incidence of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia events between the 
darolutamide and placebo treatment arms (2.31% vs. 2.17%, respectively). After adjusting for the treatment 
duration, the rates were 1.6 vs. 2.1 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 0.78. No routine 
monitoring of blood glucose values was performed in study 17712. 
Mental impairment disorders  
The incidence of mental impairment disorders at the HLGT level was comparable between darolutamide and 
placebo treatment arms (1.68% vs. 1.81%, respectively). After adjusting for the treatment duration, the rates 
were 1.2 vs. 1.7 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 0.68. 
This was followed by HLT mental impairment (excluding dementia and memory loss) (0.42% darolutamide vs. 
0.36% placebo); and includes PTs cognitive disorder (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and disturbance in attention (0% vs. 
0.2%) 
TEAEs were reported only in the darolutamide treatment arm in the HLT dementia (excluding Alzheimer's 
type) (0.52% of patients) and HLT Alzheimer's disease (including subtypes) (0.10% of patients), and 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 110/137 
  
  
  
 
included the following PTs: dementia (0.2% darolutamide vs. 0% placebo), senile dementia (0.2% vs. 0%) 
and vascular dementia (0.1% vs. 0%) and dementia Alzheimer's type (0.1% vs. 0%). 
Depressed mood disorders 
The reported PTs for HLGT ‘depressed mood disorders and disturbances’ included depression and depressed 
mood. The incidence of depressed mood disorders at the HLGT level was comparable between darolutamide 
and placebo treatment arms (1.78% vs. 1.44%, respectively). After adjusting for the treatment duration, the 
rates were 1.3 vs. 1.4 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 0.90. 
Most of the events were reported under PT depression (1.7% vs. 1.3%, respectively) while PT depressed 
mood was reported in 1 patient each in both darolutamide (0.1%) and placebo (0.2%) arms. There were no 
reports concerning suicidality. 
Breast disorders/gynecomastia 
The incidence of breast disorders/gynecomastia events was 2.31% in the darolutamide arm and 1.62% in the 
placebo arm in study 17712. After adjusting for the treatment duration, the rates were comparable, 
1.6 vs. 1.6 per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.04 
At the PT level, though, a slight difference was seen in the incidence of gynecomastia between patients 
treated with darolutamide (2.0%) compared to patients receiving placebo (1.1%). 
There were no permanent treatment discontinuations or dose interruptions due to PT gynecomastia in the 
darolutamide arm. For one patient (0.1%) in the darolutamide arm the drug dose was reduced due to 
gynecomastia.  
Adverse drug reactions 
Integrated Analysis database and clinical database for study 17712 were used for analysis of the safety data 
from the completed clinical studies in prostate cancer patients in the metastatic CRPC pool (n=173) and the 
non-metastatic CRPC pool (n=1508); cut-off date 03 SEP 2018. 
The MAH database was used complementary for analysis on individual patient level (i.e. narrative review); 
cut-off date 03 SEP 2018. 
For identification and labeling of the adverse drug reactions, the MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) of the 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reviewed and when appropriate were organised into 
groups of clinically synonymous or pathophysiologically related terms.  
The identification of the adverse drug reactions was performed in a stepwise approach: 
1) Selection of the TEAE preferred or grouped terms by: a. Evidence of disproportionality / imbalance 
between the treatment arms; Selection as “special topic” i.e. terms / disorders considered as potential risks 
or known to be associated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or with novel anti-androgens;  
2) Analysis of selected TEAE terms for evidence (supportive and refuting)  
3) Assessment of relevance of the prioritized TEAE term / medical concept 
Besides the analysis of TEAEs, summary tabulations for laboratory test and vital signs values were reviewed 
for central tendency (mean and median values) over time and abnormal values distribution (categorized by 
severity grade) including shift-from-baseline analysis.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Treatment-emergent SAEs in nmCRPC study 17712 
Overall, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 24.8% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 20.0% 
of patients in the placebo arm in study 17712. More than half of these patients had an SAE with worst grade 
of 3 in severity, with an incidence rate of 13.8% and 11.0% in the darolutamide and placebo arms, 
respectively. SAEs with worst grade of 4 were experienced by 2.0% of patients in the darolutamide arm and 
1.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Most SAEs were reported in <1% of patients in both treatment arms. 
The SAEs occurring in ≥1% of patients in either darolutamide or placebo arm, respectively, were urinary 
retention (1.6% vs. 3.2%), pneumonia (1.4% vs. 1.1%) and haematuria: (1.0% vs. 1.1%).

Deaths 
Table 38: Overview of deaths in nmCRPC study 17712 (SAF) 
The most common cause of death in both darolutamide and placebo arms was prostate cancer (3.1% vs. 4.5% 
of all patients, respectively), followed by ‘other specify’ (2.4% vs. 1.8%), and cardiovascular disease (1.9% 
vs. 2.0%).  
Table 39: Causes of deaths in nmCRPC study 17712 (SAF) 
Grade 5 TEAEs 
Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in 3.9% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 3.2% of patients in the placebo 
arm. Grade 5 TEAEs that were reported in more than 1 patient were death (0.4%), cardiac failure (0.3%), and 
cardiac arrest, general physical health deterioration, and pulmonary embolism (0.2% each) in the darolutamide 
arm; and cardiac failure and cardiac arrest (0.5% each), and acute respiratory failure (0.4%) in the placebo 
arm.  
Grade  5  TEAEs  that  were  considered  drug-related  by  the  investigator  occurred  in  0.1%  of  patients  in  the 
darolutamide  arm  (1  patient  with  small  intestinal  perforation)  and  0.4%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  (1 
patient with myocardial infarction and intracranial haemorrhage each.

Laboratory findings 
Haematological and biochemical laboratory values  
Table 40: CTCAE grades for abnormal haematological and biochemical laboratory values with 
incidence rate >5%: Worst grade after start of treatment in nmCRPC study 17712 (SAF) 
Neutrophil count decreased was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 19.6% of patients treated with 
darolutamide and in 9.4% of patients treated with placebo. The median time to nadir was 256 days. The 
laboratory tests abnormalities manifested predominantly as grade 1 or 2 intensity. Neutrophil count 
decreased of grade 3 and 4 was reported in 3.5% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. Only one patient 
permanently discontinued darolutamide due to neutropenia. Neutropenia was either transient or reversible 
(88% of patients) and were not associated with any clinically relevant signs or symptoms. 
Bilirubin increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 16.4% of patients treated with darolutamide 
and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo. The episodes were predominantly of grade 1 or 2 intensity, not 
associated with any clinically relevant signs or symptoms, and reversible after darolutamide was 
discontinued. Bilirubin increased of grade 3 was reported in 0.1% of patients treated with darolutamide and 
in 0% of patients treated with placebo. In the darolutamide arm, the mean time to first onset of increased 
bilirubin was 152.8 days, and the mean duration of the first episode was 182.4 days. No patients were 
discontinued from treatment due to increase in bilirubin. 
AST increased was reported as a laboratory abnormality in 22.5% of patients treated with darolutamide and 
in 13.6% of patients treated with placebo. The episodes were predominantly of grade 1 or 2 intensity, not 
associated with any clinically relevant signs or symptoms, and reversible after darolutamide was 
discontinued. AST increased of grade 3 was reported in 0.5% of patients treated with darolutamide and in 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 115/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
0.2% of patients treated with placebo. In the darolutamide arm, the mean time to first onset of increased 
AST was 257.8 days, and the mean duration of the first episode was 117.8 days. No patients were 
discontinued from treatment due to increase in AST. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
No differences were observed between the treatment arms in the changes of mean and median values over 
time for blood pressure measurements, body weight, BMI, and heart rate. 
Electrocardiograms 
At screening for study 17712, a 12-lead ECG was performed for all 954 and 554 patients in the darolutamide 
and placebo arm, respectively, of which 56.2% and 56.1% of patients had central baseline ECG reading 
interpreted as abnormal and thus at baseline, ECG findings were considered comparable between groups. 
There were no notable treatment arm differences with respect to the proportion of patients with changes in 
QTc from baseline or the proportion of patients with QTc interval prolongation.  The analysis of the ECG data 
over time (by visit) did not reveal any relevant imbalance between the treatment arms nor changes from 
baseline. This suggests that darolutamide has no clinically meaningful effect on the cardiac electrical 
conduction system, ectopic activity, cardiac rhythm and ST segment. 
Cardiovascular Safety Expert Report: ECG/PK Substudy of 17712 in nmCRPC patients 
A dedicated analysis of the potential effect of darolutamide on cardiac repolarization was performed in a PK 
subset of the Phase 3 study 17712 (ARAMIS). These patients had baseline ECGs and at least one triplicate ECG 
collection during darolutamide/placebo treatment, time matched to a PK sample. The PK samples covered the 
entire PK profile of darolutamide, including Cmax.  
The primary objective of this analysis was a concentration-QTc modelling approach assessing the effect of 
darolutamide concentration on cardiac repolarization.  
As secondary objectives, central tendency analyses supplemented by exploratory outlier and morphology 
analyses were performed. For the central tendency analysis, the endpoint ‘change from baseline’ was used in 
a ‘time averaged’ analysis and a ‘time point’ analysis. 
The time point analysis was performed for different post start-of-treatment time points/visits (‘by visit’) as 
well as for stratified time intervals from the last dose of study treatment (‘time post administration’). Primary 
and secondary objectives were investigated in slightly different subsets. The concentration-QTc effect was 
analysed in 323 patients receiving darolutamide and in 177 patients receiving placebo. The central tendency 
analysis was performed in 337 and 183 patients, respectively. As there was no evidence that darolutamide 
exposure has an effect on heart rate the final assessment on cardiac repolarization focused on QTcF for all 
analyses. 
The concentration-QTcF relationship of darolutamide and the single analytes, (S,S)-darolutamide, (S,R)-
darolutamide and keto-darolutamide, could be described by a predefined linear concentration-QTc effect 
model. The slopes of the concentration-QTcF relationship were negative for all three single analytes when 
estimated using the single analyte models. The upper limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of the 
estimated difference in QTcF from baseline and placebo (ΔΔQTcF) did not exceed the threshold of 10 ms 
based on the prediction of the single analyte models. The outcome did not change when a combined 
concentration-QTcF model for all three analyses was used. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 116/137 
  
  
  
 
 
The central tendency analyses did not provide a clear signal of any effect of darolutamide on heart rate, AV 
conduction as measured by the PR interval, or cardiac depolarization as measured by the QRS duration. 
There were relatively balanced rates of new clinically relevant morphological changes in the darolutamide and 
placebo arms, except for a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the darolutamide 
treatment arm, although 50% of these patients (3 of 6 patients in the darolutamide treatment arm) had a 
prior history of atrial tachyarrhythmias 
There was also no signal of any effect of darolutamide on cardiac repolarization as evidenced by the results of 
the by time point analysis. For the ‘by visit’ analysis with more than 200 patients per time point, the upper 
limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of the placebo-corrected QTcF change from baseline was less 
than 1.0 ms. For the ‘time post administration’ analysis with more than 90 patients per time point, the upper 
limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval did not exceed 5 ms at any time. The results of the time-
averaged and outlier analyses are further confirmatory evidence that darolutamide has no effect on cardiac 
repolarization. 
In patients not belonging to the PK subset, single ECGs instead of triplicate ECGs were collected with 
exception of the baseline value. The proportion of patients with QTc prolongation of >480 ms or >500 ms 
was similar in the subset and in the total safety population. No notable differences were seen in the 
proportion of patients with normal and abnormal 12-lead ECG readings at visits during treatment compared 
to baseline. There were also no notable differences between the treatment arms with respect to the 
proportion of patients with changes in QTc from baseline or the proportion of patients with QTc interval 
prolongation). 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In nmCRPC patients in study 17712, the results of population PK analysis (study 18651, PK subset of study 
17712 analysed by four age groups showed a significantly increased exposure [AUC(0 12)ss] to darolutamide 
with increasing age. An approximately 1.6 fold difference of geometric mean and median exposure was 
observed between patients of ≥85 years and patients in the <65 years age group.

Table 41: Overview of TEAEs by age in nmCRPC study 17712 (SAF) 
Race/Ethnicity 
No dedicated analysis of safety data on ethnic differences was performed. A subgroup analysis by 
geographical region (North America, Asia Pacific, ROW) were done in study 17712. There was no meaningful 
difference in the incidence of TEAEs between the geographical regions or between the treatment arms. 
Body weight 
Based on the population PK analysis there was almost no effect of body weight on the PK of darolutamide for 
patients with body weight between 75kg to≥90 kg and a comparable AUC(0 12)ss was seen in patients in 
body weight categories 75 to <80 kg, 80 to <90 kg and ≥90 kg. Of note, a relatively higher median AUC 
value was observed in the subgroup <75 kg.

Renal Impairment 
Higher incidences of grade 5 events, TEAEs leading to dose modification or permanent treatment 
discontinuation were observed in both darolutamide and placebo treatment arms as renal function worsened.  
Table 42: Overview of TEAEs by renal function at baseline in nmCRPC study 17712 (SAF) 
In the mCRPC pool, the number of patients in the moderately impaired renal function group was lower 
(N=16) compared to the other renal function groups. The overall incidences of TEAEs were comparable 
across the renal function groups. However, Grade 5 TEAEs, SAEs and dose modifications occurred more 
commonly in the moderately impaired renal function group. 
Hepatic impairment 
There were no patients with severe hepatic impairment at baseline. Two patients in the darolutamide arm 
and 1 patient in the placebo arm had moderately impaired hepatic function. 
The number of patients in both darolutamide and placebo arms, respectively, was lower in the mildly (N=89 
and N=43) and moderately (N=2 and N=1) impaired hepatic function groups compared to the normal hepatic 
function group. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 119/137 
  
  
  
 
 
 
No meaningful differences were observed between the hepatic function groups or treatment arms in the 
overall incidence of TEAEs, or in the incidence of TEAEs with worst grade of 3, 4 or 5. 
There was no clinically meaningful difference in the incidence of TEAEs between the hepatic function groups 
or between the treatment arms. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug 
In the nmCRPC population, the percentage of subjects with treatment discontinuation was comparable between 
the two arms, 8.9% in the darolutamide arm compared to 8.7% in placebo arm. All TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation occurred at low rates <1%. Except for cardiac failure (0.4% darolutamide vs. 0.7% placebo) 
and death (0.4% vs. 0.2%), all other TEAEs resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 1 or 
2  patients  each  in  either arm.  There  was  no  significant  TEAEs  in  a  particular  SOC  that  could  be  considered 
causative for treatment discontinuation.

Adverse events leading to dose interruption or dose reduction 
The percentage of patients who had TEAEs that led to dose interruption was higher in the darolutamide arm 
(12.5%) than in the placebo arm (8.8%) in nmCRPC patients in study 17712.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to dose interruption (≥0.5%) in the darolutamide arm were 
hypertension (darolutamide 0.6% vs. placebo 0%), diarrhoea (0.5% vs. 0.2%) and pneumonia (0.5% vs. 
0.4%). Urinary retention was the most common TEAE leading to dose interruption in the placebo arm 
(darolutamide 0.1% vs. placebo 0.9%) followed by nausea (0.3% vs. 0.5%) and fatigue (0.3% vs. 0.5%). 
Dose reduction was required in a higher proportion of patients in the darolutamide arm (4.8%) than in the 
placebo arm (1.6%) in study 17712.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs leading to dose reduction in both darolutamide and placebo arms, 
respectively, were fatigue (0.7% vs. 0.4%), hypertension (0.3% vs. 0.2%) and nausea (0.3% vs. 0.4%). The 
rest of the events were experienced by either 1 or 2 patients each in either arm.  
Dose was re-escalated (i.e. dose returned to the full dose of 600 mg b.i.d. after dose reduction or delay) in 
the majority of the patients who had dose modification (for any reason) in both darolutamide and placebo 
arms (91.7% vs. 88.9% of patients with dose modification, respectively)

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary analysis of safety for the proposed indication for treatment of men with nmCRPC at high risk of 
metastases comes from the pivotal phase 3 Study 17712 (ARAMIS) (n=1508 patients) and is supported by 
safety data derived from the pooled analysis of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients and from a separate pooled evaluation of safety data from completed 
Phase 1 studies in non-cancer subjects was also performed (N=101).  
Exposure to darolutamide is considered sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile. Median duration of 
treatment in the pivotal study in nmCRPC at the time of the cut-off was longer in the darolutamide arm than 
in  the  placebo  arm  (14.8  [range:  <0.1  to  44.3  months]  vs.  11.0  months  [range:  0.1  to  40.5  months], 
respectively). As of the cut-off date 3 September 2018, 64.4% of patients in the darolutamide arm and 36.1% 
in the placebo arm were still receiving study treatment. Treatment compliance was high for this study with a 
median of 100% in both arms. 
At least one dose modification was required for 15.2% of patients in the darolutamide arm and for 9.7% in the 
placebo  arm.  The  reason  for  dose  modification  was  a  TEAE  in  84.0%  of  all  dose  modification  events  in  the 
darolutamide  arm  and  in 73.1%  in  the  placebo  arm.  Treatment discontinuations  were  more  common  in  the 
placebo arm compared to darolutamide arm (63.9% vs 35.5%, respectively). There were 100 patients with no 
PSA  increase  and  without  documented  metastases  who  discontinued  darolutamide  treatment.  The  most 
frequent  reason  of  treatment  discontinuation  other  than  PSA  increase  or  documented  metastases  was  an 
adverse event in 49.0% of patients, followed by personal reason in 30.0% of patients and judgement of the 
investigator and protocol deviation in 7.0% each.

In the nmCRPC population in the pivotal study ARAMIS 17712, there was a higher incidence of TEAEs (83.2% 
vs 76.9%) and drug-related TEAEs (27% vs 19.9%) in the darolutamide arm compared to the placebo arm. 
Overall the incidence of individual TEAEs was low, with the only TEAE with incidence >10% in both treatment 
arms being fatigue which was reported in 12.1% and 8.7% of patients in the darolutamide and placebo arms 
respectively in study ARAMIS 17712. 
In study ARAMIS 17712, the most common TEAEs reported with ≥1 percentage point higher incidence in the 
darolutamide arm compared to placebo arm respectively included: fatigue (12.1% vs 8.7%), diarrhoea (6.9% 
vs 5.6%), hypertension (6.6 vs 5.2%), pain in extremity (5.8% vs 3.2%), anaemia (5.6% vs. 4.5%), hot flush 
(5.2%  vs.  4.2%),  oedema  peripheral  (4.1%  vs.  3.1%),  pollakiuria  (4.0%  vs.  2.9%),  headache  (3.9%  vs. 
2.5%), musculoskeletal pain (3.9% vs. 2.0%), dizziness (3.7% vs. 2.5%), weight decreased (3.6% vs. 2.2%), 
cough (3.0% vs. 2.0%), influenza (2.8% vs. 1.6%), rash (2.9% vs. 0.9%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(2.6% vs. 1.6%) and pyrexia (2.0% vs. 0.9%).   
When adjusted for duration of treatment, there was a higher incidence in the darolutamide arm for the PTs 
pyrexia,  musculoskeletal  pain  and  pain  in  extremity.  Considering  that  the  majority  of  pyrexia  events  were 
reported in close temporal association with bacterial infections and the absence of known association between 
androgen  deprivation  and  febrile  conditions,  the  observed  imbalance  in  the  incidence  of  pyrexia  was  not 
considered to have causal relationship to darolutamide treatment. The observed higher incidence of MedDRA 
PTs musculoskeletal pain and pain in extremity in the darolutamide vs. the placebo arm provided evidence for 
causal role for darolutamide in occurrence of these events which were included in the SmPC.  
The  incidence  rates  in  the  darolutamide  and  placebo  arms,  respectively,  were  2.9%  and  0.9%  for  rash  and 
15.8% and 11.4% for fatigue/asthenic conditions. Although the incidence of fatigue/asthenic conditions was 
similar between the treatment arms when adjusted for the difference in treatment duration, the prevalence 
rate  was  consistently  higher  in  the  darolutamide  arm  than  in  the  placebo  arm.  Events  of  rash  and 
fatigue/asthenic conditions were predominantly reported with worst grade of 1 or 2. 
There was a slight but discernible imbalance in the cardiovascular safety profile of darolutamide compared to 
placebo for cardiac arrhythmias (6.71% vs. 3.97%), coronary artery disorders (3.25% vs. 2.53%), and heart 
failures (1.89% vs. 0.90%) respectively. In the grouped terms analysis of TEAEs by AE groupings, there was 
a higher incidence of ‘rate and rhythm disorders NEC’ seen for darolutamide arm compared to placebo (3.35% 
vs  1.08%  respectively),  which  even  when  adjusted  for  treatment  duration  continued  to  show  higher  risk  in 
darolutamide arm (EAIR 2.4 per 100 PY) vs placebo (EAIR 1.0 per 100 PY) with an incidence risk ratio of 2.27. 
Even with adjustment for medical history of cardiac disorders, there remains a higher incidence of adverse CV 
events in the darolutamide arm for coronary artery disorders (1.6% vs 0.6%) and heart failures (1.0% vs 0%).  
In the ARAMIS 17712 study, patients with QT prolongation or on medication that could induce prolongation 
were not excluded. Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval and in line with other 
products in the class, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In patients with a history of risk 
factors for QT prolongation and in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that might prolong the QT 
interval, physicians should assess the benefit-risk ratio including the potential for Torsade de pointes prior to 
initiating Nubeqa. The co-administration with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal 
products able to induce Torsade de pointes should be carefully evaluated. These include medicinal products 
such  as  class IA  (e.g.,  quinidine,  disopyramide)  or  class III  (e.g.,  amiodarone,  sotalol,  dofetilide,  ibutilide) 
antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, and antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) (see SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 122/137 
  
  
  
 
There  was  a  slight  imbalance  in  terms  of  higher  incidence  of  coronary  artery  disorders  for  darolutamide 
compared to placebo. Whilst it is acknowledged there are some structural differences between the three novel 
androgen  receptor  inhibitors,  the  class  effect  for  potentiating  a  slight  increase  in  ischemic  heart  disease  / 
coronary artery disorders cannot be overlooked. Therefore, these adverse drug reactions are included in section 
4.8 of SmPC. 
Patients  with  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  disease  in  the  past  6 months  including  stroke,  myocardial 
infarction,  severe/unstable  angina  pectoris,  coronary/peripheral  artery  bypass  graft,  and  symptomatic 
congestive heart failure were excluded from the clinical studies. Therefore, the safety of darolutamide in these 
patients  has  not  been  established.  If  darolutamide  is  prescribed,  patients  with  clinically  significant 
cardiovascular disease should be treated for these conditions according to established guidelines (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  Cardiovascular events in patients with significant cardiovascular history will be closely monitored 
as reflected in the RMP (important potential risk). 
Whilst there was no overall imbalance in incidence of hypertension between treatment arms when adjusted 
for treatment duration (4.7 vs 5.1 EAIR per 100 PY for darolutamide and placebo respectively), there was a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 hypertension and hypertension requiring dose interruption/reduction in the 
darolutamide arm compared to the placebo arm. Hypertension will be closely monitored in the PSUR. 
There is a plausible mechanism by which androgen receptor inhibition could increase fracture risk. When 
adjusted for treatment duration between the treatment arms, the rates of fracture were 3.0 vs. 3.5 per 100 
PY suggesting comparable rates of fracture and no increase in fracture risk with darolutamide compared to 
placebo. However, updated data reported that the EAIR was 3.5 vs 3.2 per 100 PY showing a higher 
incidence with darolutamide. Considering the effect of additional androgen depletion additive to ADT is likely 
to have increased negative effects on bone mineral density over time, with longer duration of darolutamide + 
ADT, the risk for fracture is likely to be further increased above placebo + ADT. Therefore, fracture has been 
included in the SmPC, section 4.8. 
In the ARAMIS 17712 study, patients with a history of seizures were not excluded. There was imbalance noted 
in  the baseline  history of  seizures  between  arms,  however  this  was  weighted  against  the  darolutamide  arm 
which  is  acceptable  in  assessing  safety.  Overall,  13.6%  of  patients  in  the  ARAMIS  study  (14.9%  in  the 
darolutamide  and  11.4%  in  the  placebo  arm)  used  drugs  with  intermediate  or  high  epileptogenic  potential 
concomitantly  to  study  medication.  Approximately  13%  of  patients  were  on  medication  known  to  lower  the 
seizure threshold and the incidence of seizure remained low.  
The  incidence  of  seizure  events  reported  during  the  study  treatment  was  similar  in  both  treatment  arms  in 
study  ARAMIS  17712.  The  events  were  reported  for  2  patients  (0.21%)  in  the  darolutamide  arm  and  for  1 
patient (0.18%) in the placebo arm. None of the patients with a medical history of seizure experienced a TEAE 
of seizure in the darolutamide arm. Seizures were reported with worst grade of 1 or 2 in both treatment arms. 
Based on the clinical data available there is no evidence that treatment with darolutamide would increase the 
risk for seizures. 
The incidence of ‘pneumonia and pneumonitis’ was 3.25% in the darolutamide arm and 2.17% in the placebo 
arm and when the analysis was adjusted for difference in treatment duration between the arms there was still 
a slightly higher rate of pneumonia and pneumonitis in the darolutamide arm compared to placebo, 2.3 vs. 2.1 
per 100 PY, respectively, with an incidence risk ratio of 1.10. There were three reported cases of pneumonitis 
in the darolutamide arm, one case of Grade 1, 2 and 3 each while no case of pneumonitis was reported in the 
placebo arm. Pneumonitis will be followed in PSUR. 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 123/137 
  
  
  
 
Overall, there was a higher incidence of Grade 3 and 4 AEs reported in darolutamide arm in the pivotal study 
ARAMIS  17712  in  nmCRPC  patients:  Grade  3  AEs  22.5%  vs  17.9%  and  Grade  4  AEs  2.2%  vs  1.6%  for 
darolutamide compared to placebo, respectively. However, most of the Grade 3 AEs occurred at low frequency. 
Hypertension was the most common Grade 3 AE occurring more commonly in the darolutamide arm compared 
to placebo arm (3.1% vs 2.2%). Most of the Grade 4 AEs occurred in only 1 patient, except for the following 
four Grade 4 AEs, acute myocardial infarction, hyperglycaemia, ischemic stroke and respiratory failure, which 
occurred in 0.2% of patients each in darolutamide arm, with no corresponding events reported in the placebo 
arm.  
In the ARAMIS 17712 study, three Grade 4 AEs were reported under SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (mainly respiratory failure and dyspnoea) for patients on darolutamide and two Grade 4 events for 
patients on placebo. There was no obvious recurring pattern seen for the high-grade AEs as reported and none 
were considered causally related to study medication. 
There was overall a higher incidence of SAEs in the darolutamide arm compared to placebo arm (24.8% vs 
20% respectively). Most of the SAEs individually occurred at low incidence. The SOC with the highest incidence 
of SAEs was cardiac disease, (5.3% darolutamide vs 3.2% placebo).  
The incidence of deaths was lower in the darolutamide arm 8.3% compared to placebo arm 10.5% in the pivotal 
study  in  nmCRPC.  The  most  common  cause  of  death  was  prostate  cancer  followed  by  ‘other  specify’  and 
‘cardiovascular disease’. On reviewing the MedDRA PT for the category ‘Other, specify’, there were potentially 
2  additional  deaths  within  cardiovascular  disease  category  for  darolutamide  arm  (heart  injury  and  angina 
pectoris) and one additional death in the placebo arm (cardiac arrest). Despite comparable rates of death due 
to cardiovascular disease between arms, 1.9% in darolutamide arm vs 2.0% in the placebo arm, cardiovascular 
disease accounted for 22.8% of all the deaths in the darolutamide arm vs only 19% of all the deaths in the 
placebo arm. Heart failure and ischemic heart disease have been included as ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8.   
Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in 3.9% of patients in the darolutamide arm and in 3.2% of patients in the placebo 
arm.  It  is  acknowledged  that  numbers  are  low,  however  in  the  darolutamide  arm  there  were  two  Grade  5 
events (0.2%) of pulmonary embolism with no corresponding events in the placebo arm which is not negligible 
considering these patients were non metastatic at study entry.   
Based on available laboratory data, a causal role of darolutamide in neutrophil count decreased, in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased and in blood bilirubin increased has been suggested. Adequate information 
has been included in this regard in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Based on the available safety data, it is considered that darolutamide has no or negligible influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines (see SmPC section 4.7). 
The highest dose of darolutamide studied clinically was 900 mg twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 
1800 mg. No dose limiting toxicities were observed with this dose. Considering the saturable absorption (see 
section 5.2) and the absence of evidence for acute toxicity, an intake of a higher than recommended dose of 
darolutamide is not expected to lead to toxicity. In the event of intake of a higher than recommended dose, 
treatment with darolutamide can be continued with the next dose as scheduled. There is no specific antidote 
for darolutamide and symptoms of overdose are not established (see SmPC section 4.9). 
In relation to special population, patients with severe renal function at baseline were poorly represented. Only 
one  patient  was  included  in  darolutamide  arm  of  study  17712.  Given  the  2.5-fold  increase  in  exposure  in 
patients with severe renal function, those patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see SmPC 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 124/137 
  
  
  
 
section  4.4).  Furthermore,  the  use  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  has  been  included  as  missing 
information in the RMP. 
In the nmCRPC study 17712, no meaningful differences were observed between the hepatic function groups or 
treatment arms in the overall incidence of TEAEs, or in the incidence of TEAEs with worst grade of 3, 4 or 5. 
However, in the mCRPC pool Grade 5 TEAEs and SAEs occurred more commonly in patients with mildly impaired 
hepatic function than in patients with normal liver function. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not 
represented. No patients were included in the nmCRPC study 17712 or in the mCRPC pool. Overall, the data 
on patients with baseline hepatic impairment is considered limited (see SmPC section 4.4). ADRs resulting from 
increased exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment will be closely monitored as reflected in the RMP 
under important potential risk. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC is a 
contraindication (see SmPC section 4.3). 
Nubeqa contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product (see SmPC section 4.4). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. Adequate risk minimisation measures have been put in place to manage 
adverse drug reactions. If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable adverse reaction (see 
SmPC section 4.8), dosing should be withheld or reduced to 300 mg twice daily until symptoms improve. 
Treatment may then be resumed at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Dose reduction below 300 mg twice daily is 
not recommended, because efficacy has not been established (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product as well as to monitor 
the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. As part of the routine pharmacovigilance activity, targeted 
follow-up questionnaires will be implemented to obtain structured information on reported suspected adverse 
reactions in patients with history of hepatic impairment, history of renal impairment and patients with cardiac 
disorders. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  darolutamide  appears  to  be  well  tolerated  in  study  ARAMIS  17712  with  a  low  overall  incidence  of 
TEAEs.  As  with other androgen receptor antagonists in this class, darolutamide is associated with increased 
incidence of fatigue, rash, musculoskeletal pain and pain in extremity. However, these appeared manageable 
with most events being of grade 1 or 2 in severity. Darolutamide was also associated with a higher incidence 
of  neutropenia,  increased  bilirubin  and  increased  AST  levels.  Based  on  clinical  data  available  there  was  no 
incremental risk with the addition of darolutamide to ADT for AEs such as fracture, fall, seizure, hypertension, 
weight decrease, mental impairment, diabetes and hyperglycaemia, cerebrovascular disorders, vasodilatation 
and flushing, depressed mood disorders, and breast disorders/gynecomastia. 
Some of the reported events (cardiac disorders, seizures, flushing or hot flushes, hypertension, 
gynecomastia, thromboembolic events [venous, arterial and ischemic CNS], neutrophil count decreased/ 
neutropenia and pneumonitis) will be closely monitored in PSUR.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 30 July 2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of darolutamide with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of 
isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers darolutamide to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nubeqa (darolutamide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The application is for Nubeqa in the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (prostate specific antigen doubling 
time  (PSADT)  of  ≤  10  months  and  PSA  levels  ≥  2  ng/mL).  Medical  castration  with  gonadotropin  releasing 
hormone analogue (GnRHa) should be continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated. 
Castration-resistant  prostate  cancer  (CRPC)  is  defined  as  prostate  cancer  that  progresses  despite  castrate 
levels of testosterone while on treatment with a luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa) or 
following bilateral orchiectomy. Signs of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) include rising PSA 
level, which represents chemical progression before radiologically detectable metastases. Non-metastatic CRPC 
patients with a PSADT of ≤10 months are at the highest risk for developing imminent metastatic disease and 
prostate cancer-specific death. 
The delay of metastases and the associated morbidity for as long as possible is the goal of therapy for men 
with nmCRPC. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Prior to 2018, there were no approved medicines for this indication and the management was conservative 
with serial PSA monitoring to assess the doubling time. Since then two AR antagonists, enzalutamide and 
apalutamide, have been approved for the treatment of non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer at 
high risk of developing metastasis.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre 
Phase 3 trial to evaluate darolutamide vs placebo administered concurrently with ADT in patients with 
nmCRPC who are at high risk for developing metastases (Study ARAMIS, 17712). A total of 1509 patients 
were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: darolutamide (955 patients) or 
placebo (554 patients). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the time of data cut off, 3rd September 2018, efficacy results from the pivotal ARAMIS study in the target 
population included the main analysis planned for MFS (BIRC assessed) and the first interim analysis for OS. 
At the time of the primary analysis, 23.1% patients in the darolutamide arm versus 39% in the placebo arm 
presented a MFS event. The results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in MFS in favour of 
darolutamide (HR 0.413 (95% CI: [0.341; 0.500]) with a p-value of <0.000001. The median MFS (95% CI) 
was 40.37 months (95% CI: 34.33, NE) in the darolutamide group versus 18.43 months (95% CI: 15.51, 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 130/137 
  
  
  
 
22.34) in the placebo group (Δ 21.94 months). These results are supported by several sensitivity analyses as 
well as by subgroups analyses. 
While still immature, the secondary endpoints showed consistency with primary efficacy outcomes. Only 136 
out of a planned 240 OS events had occurred at an interim analysis. The HR was 0.706 95% CI [0.501; 
0.994] and the median was not reached in either treatment arm. 8.2% versus 10.5% events had occurred in 
the darolutamide and placebo arm respectively. There was a positive trend for overall survival and the initial 
results presented for time to pain progression, initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy and first symptomatic 
skeletal event all favoured darolutamide.  
The additional endpoints for example PFS, PSA progression and response, time to invasive procedure and the 
measures used to assess ECOG performance status deterioration and QoL currently favour darolutamide. 
Specifically, PFS which was considered an additional endpoint demonstrated that 26.7% in the darolutamide 
arm vs 46.6% in the placebo arm experienced events. The median was 36.83 months for darolutamide and 
14.82 months in the placebo arm with HR 0.38, 95%CI [0.319; 0.454] p < 0.000001. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The data presented for the secondary and additional endpoints are still premature and reflect interim 
analyses only. The efficacy of darolutamide should be further investigated to confirm the positive trend 
observed. The final CSR of study ARAMIS is expected by 30 June 2020 (see Annex II condition). 
ECOG performance status at baseline were 0 or 1. Thus efficacy of darolutamide in patients with ECOG > 1 is 
unknown (see SmPC section 5.1). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety data of darolutamide (600 mg [2 tablets of 300 mg] b.i.d.) in the proposed indication are mainly 
based on the ARAMIS study. A total of 1508 patients received either darolutamide (N=954) or placebo 
(N=554) concurrently with ADT. Supportive safety data were derived from pooled analysis of Phase 1 and 2 
studies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients (N=173).  
Overall the incidence of individual TEAEs was low, with the only TEAE with incidence >10% in both treatment 
arms being fatigue which was reported in 12.1% and 8.7% of subjects in the darolutamide and placebo arms 
respectively in study ARAMIS. 
In study ARAMIS the most common TEAEs included fatigue (12.1% vs 8.7%), diarrhoea (6.9% vs 5.6%), 
hypertension (6.6 vs 5.2%), pain in extremity (5.8% vs 3.2%), anaemia (5.6% vs. 4.5%), hot flush (5.2% 
vs. 4.2%), oedema peripheral (4.1% vs. 3.1%), pollakiuria (4.0% vs. 2.9%), headache (3.9% vs. 2.5%), 
musculoskeletal pain (3.9% vs. 2.0%), dizziness (3.7% vs. 2.5%), weight decreased (3.6% vs. 2.2%), cough 
(3.0% vs. 2.0%), rash (2.9% vs. 0.9%), influenza (2.8% vs. 1.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.6% 
vs. 1.6%) and pyrexia (2.0% vs. 0.9%).   
Within the analysis of adverse events of special interest, there is discernible imbalance for darolutamide 
compared to placebo for cardiac arrhythmias (6.71% vs. 3.97%), coronary artery disorders (3.25% vs. 
2.53%), and heart failures (1.89% vs. 0.90%) respectively. The SOC with the highest incidence of SAEs was 
also cardiac disease (5.3% darolutamide vs 3.2% placebo). Of note, among Grade 5 TEAEs two sudden death 
and two cardiac arrest were reported in the darolutamide arm. Even when the analysis is performed taking 
EMA/84124/2020 
Page 131/137 
  
  
  
 
background cardiac history into account, the incidence of CV AEs in patients without prior cardiac history 
remains higher in the darolutamide arm.  
The safety of darolutamide treatment is considered unknown for patients experiencing the following within 6 
months before treatment: stroke, myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral 
artery bypass graft; congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV (see SmPC sections 
4.4 and 5.1). Considering the overall incidence of TEAEs in the SOC cardiac disorders was higher in the 
darolutamide arm compared to placebo arm, cardiovascular events in patients with significant cardiovascular 
history will be closely monitored as reflected in the RMP (important potential risk). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Whilst overall there was no increased incidence of hypertension observed with darolutamide treatment, some 
of the hypertension events which occurred were significant and warrant further consideration. There was a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 hypertension compared to placebo. Hypertension will be closely monitored in 
PSUR. 
The available data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment are limited and 
darolutamide has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
4.4). As exposure might be increased those patients will be closely monitored for adverse reactions (see 
SmPC and RMP). In addition, adequate measures to obtain structured information on reported suspected 
adverse reactions in patients with history of hepatic or renal impairment will be put in place as part of the 
routine pharmacovigilance activity (see RMP). 
ECOG performance status at baseline were 0 or 1. Thus safety of darolutamide in patients with ECOG > 1 is 
unknown (see SmPC section 5.1).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Darolutamide demonstrated a significant improvement in metastasis free survival in patients with castrate 
resistant non metastatic prostate cancer with a PSA doubling time of ≤ 10 months and PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/mL.  
The improvement translated into a difference of 21.94 months. 
The data presented for the secondary and additional endpoints are still premature and reflect interim 
analyses only. However, the results for overall survival shows a positive trend for darolutamide. PFS as an 
additional endpoint is favouring darolutamide which is reassuring. Further analysis will be required to ensure 
that this positive trend is maintained in favour of darolutamide and the final CSR of study ARAMIS will be 
submitted by 30 June 2020 (PAES). 
Early results from secondary and additional endpoints evaluating patient’s symptoms (pain, local symptoms) 
were positive. Prolonging the time to pain progression and time to treatment for first symptomatic skeletal 
events while also delaying additional treatment provide further support to the primary endpoint, especially 
given that the initial diagnosis of metastasis may not be symptomatic for the patient or require further 
treatment immediately. This is important given that men who are initially diagnosed as castrate resistant 
without metastasis are generally well and even once metastasis is diagnosed, can remain asymptomatic. It 
may take months even years to become significantly affected by their disease clinically.

The safety profile of darolutamide is considered well characterized at this stage and a number of adverse 
events will be closely monitored in PSUR: cardiac disorders, seizures, flushing or hot flushes, hypertension, 
gynecomastia, thromboembolic events [venous, arterial and ischemic CNS], neutrophil count decreased/ 
neutropenia and pneumonitis. As with other novel androgen receptor antagonists in this class, darolutamide 
has demonstrated increased incidence of rash, fatigue and musculoskeletal pain. However, these are 
predominantly lower grade AEs and generally tolerable. 
In addition, adequate routine pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation measures are in place to manage the 
risks associated with Nubeqa. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Darolutamide has shown a statistically significant improvement in metastasis free survival compared to 
placebo with a favourable safety profile in patients with castrate resistant non metastatic prostate cancer who 
are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Although not yet mature, the interim analyses of the 
secondary endpoints support the primary analysis. Overall, the efficacy results are considered clinically 
meaningful.  
From a safety perspective, the overall incidence of adverse events is low and darolutamide appears to be 
relatively well tolerated.  
The main uncertainty is related to the immaturity of the OS results presented. However, the effect shown in 
delaying the development of metastasis overcome this uncertainty and this new treatment represents a 
valuable option for patients with nmCRPC who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Therefore, 
the B/R balance is considered positive. 
The final CSR providing updated efficacy data on OS and other secondary endpoints will be submitted by 
30 June 2020 (PAES). 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Nubeqa in the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (NM-CRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease is positive.  
4.  Recommendations

1.  Introduction 
On 5 December 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Menveo, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study V72_56 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In the study two vaccines were evaluated: GSK Biologicals’ MenACWY - CRM197 (Menveo, further 
referred to as MenACWY in this document) conjugated vaccine, and GSK Biologicals’ rMenB vaccine 
(Bexsero). 
The drug product presentation for MenACWY consisted of one vial containing the lyophilized MenA 
conjugate component and one vial or syringe containing the liquid MenCWY conjugate component. The 
vaccine ready for IM was obtained by reconstitution of the lyophilized MenA with the liquid MenCWY 
component to administer the final quantity / dose of 0.5 mL of the reconstituted vaccine, which 
contained 10 μg MenA, 5 μg MenC, 5 μg MenW, 5 μg Men Y.  
rMenB was supplied in a prefilled syringe (0.5 mL volume) administered by intramuscular injection 
(IM); each dose contained 50 μg of each of the following N meningitidis purified antigens (961c, 936-
741, 287-953), 25 μg of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) from N meningitidis strain NZ98/254, 
adsorbed in 1.5 mg of aluminium hydroxide.

either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age. The study was conducted at 7 centres 
in Mexico (4) and Argentina (3), from June 2017 to October 2016. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To assess immunological noninferiority of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY when concomitantly 
administered compared to either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age, as measured 
by the ratio of hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) against each of the serogroup B indicator strains 
(for rMenB+OMV NZ) and serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y (for MenACWY) at one month after the 4th 
vaccination.  
Noninferiority was to be concluded if, at one month following the 4th vaccination, the lower limits of 
the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the between-group ratios of GMTs 
(rMenB+OMV NZ + MenACWY versus rMenB+OMV NZ, and rMenB+OMV NZ + MenACWY versus 
MenACWY) were >0.5 for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
Secondary Objectives: 
To assess the immune response of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY when concomitantly administered 
compared to either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age. 
• at 1 month after the 4th vaccination 
• at 1 month after the 3rd vaccination 
• at 6 months after the 3rd vaccination 
Safety Objective:  
To assess the safety and tolerability of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY when concomitantly 
administered, compared to either alone, in infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age.

Study design 
Subjects were to be randomized to one of the three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive at 3, 5, 
7 and 13 months of age: 
• Vaccine Group rMenB+ACWY: rMenB vaccine given concomitantly with MenACWY (referred to as 
Group A in protocol), 
• Vaccine Group rMenB: rMenB vaccine alone (referred to as Group B in protocol),  
• Vaccine Group MenACWY: MenACWY vaccine alone (referred to as Group C in protocol). 
Table 1 Overview of study design 
The study ran for approximately 11 months. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to study groups 
according to a randomization list. The randomization was stratified by centre, to ensure balance in the 
assignment to the 3 vaccine groups within each centre. This trial was designed as an open-label trial.  
Study population /Sample size 
Healthy infants aged 3 months (85-119 days, inclusive) were to be enrolled. In and exclusion criteria 
were in line with common criteria for vaccine trials in infants. 
Subjects were to be randomized to one of the 3 vaccine groups in a 1:1:1 ratio with approximately 250 
subjects per arm for an overall target enrollment of approximately 750 infants, 3 months of age at the 
enrollment. Assuming an approximate drop-out or not evaluable sample rate of 20%, a total sample 
size of 600 evaluable subjects was expected to be included in immunogenicity analyses (200 evaluable 
subjects per vaccine group). A sample size of 200 evaluable subjects per arm was to provide at least 
86.9% overall power to demonstrate noninferiority of rMenB given together with MenACWY versus 
rMenB given alone and versus MenACWY given alone, at 1 month after the 4th vaccination, as 
measured by the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of between-group ratio of human serum 
bactericidal assay (hSBA) GMTs (rMenB+ACWY versus rMenB alone, and rMenB+ACWY versus 
MenACWY alone) being greater than 0.5 (noninferiority margin) for all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, 
and 4 serogroup B indicator strains, ie, noninferiority must be simultaneously demonstrated for all 8 
serogroups/strains.

CHMP comments 
Of note, MenACWY is currently not licensed for this age group in Europe. 
As non-inferiority had to be demonstrated for all serogroups/strains, multiplicity is no issue. 
Treatments 
Subjects either received MenACWY, given as four doses at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age on day 1, 61, 
121 and 301; rMenB, given as four doses on the same days as MenACWY; or MenACWY together with 
rMenB according to the same schedule  (see table 1).  
Each dose of rMenB contained 50 μg of each of the following N meningitidis purified antigens (961c, 
936-741, 287-953), 25 μg of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) from N meningitidis strain NZ98/254, 
adsorbed in 1.5 mg of aluminum hydroxide. 
MenACWY comprised meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y oligosaccharides that were each 
conjugated to the protein carrier CRM197. The vaccine ready for IM was obtained by reconstitution of 
the lyophilized MenA with the liquid MenCWY component to administer the final dose of 0.5 mL of the 
reconstituted vaccine, which contained 10 μg MenA, 5 μg MenC, 5 μg MenW, 5 μg Men Y. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
The hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroup B indicator strains (for rMenB) and serogroups A, C, 
W-135 and Y (for MenACWY) at 1 month after the 4th vaccination, and corresponding between-group 
ratios of GMTs for rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB (serogroup B indicator strains), and rMenB+ACWY vs. 
MenACWY (serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y). 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The immune response to rMenB at day 1, day 51, day 301, and day 331 when administered alone and 
concomitantly with MenACWY (rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB) was assessed by: 
•  hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroup B reference strains;  
• 
the % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 and subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against each of the 
serogroup B reference strains. 
The immune response to MenACWY at day 1, day 51, day 301, and day 331 when administered alone 
and concomitantly with rMenB (rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY) was assessed by: 
•  hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y; 
• 
the % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:4 and subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against each of the 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
Additionally, the following were also to be assessed for each of the serogroup B strains and each of the 
serogroups A, C, W and Y: 
•  within-subject geometric mean ratios (GMRs) will be calculated for GMTs at one month after 
4th vaccination (day 331) vs. pre 4th vaccination (day 301),

• 
the %  of subjects with 4-fold increases in hSBA titers at one month after 4th vaccination 
(day 331) vs. pre 4th vaccination (day 301). 
CHMP comments 
Considering the relevance of the different endpoints the discussion of secondary endpoints will focus on 
the response rates expressed as % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 (MenACWY) or ≥1:5 (rMenB). Other 
endpoints will only be reported if there are anomalies, i.e. they are not in line with primary outcomes 
(GMTs) or response rates. Of note, this AR applies to MenACWY, not rMenB. 
Safety Endpoints 
•  The frequencies and percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs during the 7 
days (including the day of vaccination) after day 1, 61, 121, and 301 for all vaccine groups. 
•  The frequencies and percentages of subjects with any other (unsolicited) AEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal and medically attended AEs during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) at 
day 1, 61, 121, and 301 for all vaccine groups. 
•  The frequencies and percentages of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and 
medically attended AEs throughout the study period. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis populations 
The primary immunogenicity analyses were based on the per-protocol set, which included all 
subjects who:  
• 
correctly received the vaccine (ie, received the vaccine to which the subjects were randomized 
and at the scheduled time points).  
•  had no reportable Protocol Deviations (PDs) leading to exclusion as defined prior to creation of 
protected snapshot / analysis.  
•  were not excluded due to other reasons defined prior to creation of protected snapshot or 
analysis. 
The secondary immunogenicity analyses on the full analysis set (FAS) which involved all subjects in 
the ‘All Enrolled Set’ (see below) who were randomized, received at least one study vaccination and 
provided evaluable immunogenicity data at respective vaccination visit. 
The safety analyses were based on the safety set: All subjects in the ‘all enrolled set’ who received a 
study vaccination with solicited AE data for each of the vaccinations and/or with unsolicited AE data. 
Summaries of demographic, baseline characteristics and individual subject listing were based on the 
All Enrolled analysis set: All screened subjects who provided informed consent and provided 
demographic and/or other baseline screening measurements, regardless of the subject’s randomization 
and vaccination status in the trial, and received a subject identification number (ID).

Statistical analysis 
To evaluate the immune response to vaccination with rMenB, the hSBA GMTs at 1 month after the 4th 
vaccination (day 331) were compared between vaccine groups rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB. Noninferiority 
of vaccine group rMenB+ACWY to rMenB was determined if, at 1 month following the 4th vaccination 
(day 331), the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the between-group ratios of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY 
vs. rMenB) was >0.5 (noninferiority margin) for each of the 4 serogroup MenB indicator strains. 
Similarly, the immune response to vaccination with MenACWY was evaluated by determining if 
rMenB+ACWY was noninferior to vaccine group MenACWY if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the ratio of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY), at 1 month after the 4th vaccination (day 331) was 
>0.5 for each of the N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
Noninferiority was only to be concluded if all these 8 inferiority hypotheses were rejected, ie, the 8 
hypotheses were co-primary. 
Summary tables are provided for adjusted GMTs of each vaccine group and between group ratios of 
each vaccine group comparison. The 2-sided 95% CIs for each between group ratio of GMTs were 
constructed using the common estimate of error from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with vaccine 
group and centre as factors in the model. 
An interim analysis was performed to provide Health Authorities with preliminary information on the 
safety, tolerability and immune response of rMenB and MenACWY, in order to support the inclusion of 
these 2 vaccines in the national immunization programs. The interim analysis was applied to the 
subset of subjects who completed visit 4 (ie, 1 month post 3rd vaccination) at the time of interim data 
lock point. In this context, early terminated subjects were included in the interim analysis subset if 
they had the possibility of reaching visit 4 prior to the interim data lock point (ie, enrolled 150 days 
prior to the interim data lock point). The results are presented in an interim CSR (dated 02 OCT 2015). 
The data or the results from this interim analysis were not used to make any decision on the 
continuation of this open label trial. This analysis was descriptive, with the relevant endpoints, analysis 
sets and methods aligning with the secondary objectives of this study.  Therefore, the MAH concludes 
that no impact on the conduct or subsequent full data analysis of the trial was expected. 
CHMP comments 
It is not possible to exclude the possibility that the results of the interim analysis impacted further 
conduct of this trial. For example, it is not known whether the results of this interim analysis were 
communicated to investigators or other people involved in the conduct of the trial. Therefore an alpha 
correction would have been in place. Nonetheless if the results are in line with previous results, an 
alpha correction is not expected to impact the conclusions of the trial significantly.

Results 
CHMP comments 
A serious GCP compliance issue occurred during the study that led to exclusion of 1 study center – site 
112, from the analysis set. Data collected for the study have not been used for any analysis of study 
data with the exception of the safety data which has been included in the study report. 
The responsible Principal Investigator of site 112 failed to conduct the study according to ICH GCP 
including the provision of resources throughout the duration of the study and direct oversight of the 
study conduct, ie,: 
- Randomization of subject without being eligible, 
- Failure to provide adequate resources for the duration of the study (lack of meeting payment 
obligations to site staff), 
- Failure to maintain access to the subject randomization and electronic data capture systems, 
- General lack of understanding of GCP principles. 
This serious GCP compliance issue resulted in the decision to terminate the participation of the 
investigator in this study. A total of 38 subjects were enrolled and affected. 
Enrolled subjects completed the trial in order to complete the vaccination schedule. Intensified 
monitoring was implemented to ensure proper completion and documentation of study for already 
enrolled subjects. All 38 subjects enrolled were followed up for safety for solicited and non-solicited 
AEs for the duration as defined in the protocol. 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 750 subjects were enrolled: 252 subjects in rMenB+ACWY group, 250 in rMenB group, and 
248 in MenACWY group out of which 249 (99%) in rMenB+ACWY group, 249 (>99%) in rMenB group, 
and 246 (99%) in MenACWY group received the study vaccination.

Figure 1 Subject Disposition Flow Chart 
The numbers of premature withdrawals were balanced across the vaccine groups (17%-19%). The 
main reason for premature withdrawal was ‘lost to follow up’ with 25 (10%) in rMenB+ACWY group, 20 
(8%) in rMenB group, and 13 (5%) in MenACWY group. Two (1%) subjects in rMenB group (due to 
pyrexia and anaemia, respectively) and 1 (<1%) subject in MenACWY group (due to atopic dermatitis) 
were withdrawn due to an AE. One subject in rMenB group was withdrawn from the study due to PD.

Efficacy results 
Primary objective: 
At one month after the 4th vaccination (day 331), the lower limits of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the 
between-group ratios of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB, and rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY) were >0.5 
for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. Thus, rMenB and MenACWY 
when concomitantly administered (rMenB+ACWY), were noninferior to rMenB or MenACWY 
administered alone according to the predefined criteria. 
Table 4 Geometric Mean hSBA Titres and Vaccine Group Ratios against N meningitidis 
serogroup B strains (for rMenB) and serogroups A,C,W,Y (for MenACWY) at 1 month post 4th 
vaccination – per protocol set month post 4th vaccination. 
The results in the FAS population were similar. 
CHMP comments 
It is noted that all 8 hypotheses were rejected and thus non-inferiority has been demonstrated.  The 
response to combined administration of rMenB+MenACWY is higher for serogroup A (409 vs 165) and 
slightly better for serogroup W (721 vs 536). This has no impact on the use of the vaccine as such, as 
it would favour concomitant administration.

The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 at each of the timepoints were similar between the 
rMenB+ACWY and rMenB groups against each of the serogroup B strains as the 95% CI of the vaccine 
group differences included 0.  
The responses following administration of rMenB vaccine considering the other secondary endpoints 
were in line with this. The hSBA GMTs at each of the timepoints were similar between the 
rMenB+ACWY and rMenB groups against each of the serogroup B strains as the 95% CI of the vaccine 
group ratios included 1. The vaccine group differences indicated similar percentages of subjects with at 
least 4-fold increase in titers at 1 month after the 4th vaccination (day 331) over pre 4th vaccination 
(day 301)in both vaccine groups at 1 month after the 4th vaccination.

except for the serogroup A in which the percentages were higher in the rMenB+ACWY group than 
those in the MenACWY group at 1 month post 3rd and 4th vaccinations. 
CHMP comments 
The response for serogroup A rMenB+ACWY is higher than to MenACWY alone one month after the 3rd 
and one month after the 4th dose. The response in the concomitant administration group is 100% vs 
96% in the MenACWY group. This was also observed for the primary objective, and further confirmed 
by other secondary outcomes (i.e. fourfold outcome, GMRs).  
Safety results 
The presentation of safety results will be limited to those subjects who received MenACWY.  
Exposure  
A total of 744 (99%) subjects out of 750 enrolled subjects were exposed to the study vaccine and were 
included in the overall safety set, solicited safety set (6 hours-day 7) and unsolicited safety set. A total 
of 704 (94%) subjects after the 1st vaccination, 678 (90%) after the 2nd vaccination, 656 (87%) after 
the 3rd vaccination, and 607 (81%) after the 4th vaccination was included in the solicited safety set. 
Adverse Events 
Solicited AEs 
After vaccination with MenACWY, the most common solicited local AE was tenderness. After vaccination 
with MenACWY, severe tenderness was reported in 1%-7% subjects after the 1st vaccination, <1%-
4% subjects after the 2nd vaccination, 1%-3% subjects after the 3rd vaccination, and 1%-2% subjects 
after the 4th vaccination. 
Most of the reported local solicited local AEs after each dose of vaccine were mild to moderate in 
intensity with onset from 6 hours to day 3 after vaccination. 
Persistent crying and irritability were the most common solicited systemic AEs reported after each 
vaccination across the vaccine groups, reported by 36% and 37% of MenACWY recipients after the 1st 
dose,  29% and 31% after the second dose, 27% and 28% after the 3rd dose and after the 4th dose. In 
those who received rMenB+ACWY this was 52% and 47% after the 1st dose,  46% and 44% after the 
2nd and 41% and 38% after the 3rd dose respectively. 
Fever (body temperature measured by axillary route ≥38°C) was reported in 21% (rMenB+ACWY 
group), and 4% (MenACWY group) subjects after the 1st vaccination, 21% and 7% subjects after the 
2nd vaccination, 17%, and 11% subjects after the 3rd vaccination, and 26% and 9% subjects after the 
4th vaccination. 
Unsolicited AEs: 
By system organ class 
The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs were classified under the MedDRA SOC of ‘infections and 
infestations’ reported in 160 (64%) rMenB+ACWY subjects and 173 (70%) MenACWY subjects. The 
SOC of ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’, was reported in 95 (38%) rMenB+ACWY 
subjects and 19 (8%) MenACWY subjects.

At least possibly related AEs reported throughout the study were most commonly reported under the 
SOC of ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’, in 90 (36%) rMenB+ACWY subjects and 
14 (6%) MenACWY subjects. 
By preferred term 
Across vaccine groups, after any vaccination, the most commonly reported unsolicited AEs, by PT, 
were: nasopharyngitis (32%-35%, across vaccine groups) and viral upper respiratory tract infection 
(29%-35%).  
The most common at least possibly related AE reported throughout the study, by PT, was injection site 
induration that continued beyond day 8 after each vaccination, reported in 35% subjects receiving 
rMenB vaccine, either alone or in combination with MenACWY; it was reported in only 1% subjects 
receiving MenACWY alone. 
Most of the unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and most of them resolved before study 
termination. 
Deaths and Serious Adverse events 
There were no deaths and none of the Serious Adverse events were considered related to MenACWY. 
There was one case of anaemia considered potentially related to rMenB vaccination, which will not be 
discussed here as the subject did not receive MenACWY. 
There was one case of Kawasaki’s disease in a subject who was vaccinated with rMenB and MenACWY. 
The subject developed fever 117 days after the 3rd study vaccination and was diagnosed with 
Kawasaki’s disease 4 days later. In the opinion of the investigator, the event Kawasaki’s disease was 
considered serious due to hospitalization and was not related to study vaccine. The SAE was 
considered resolved, with outcome of complete recovery. 
CHMP comments 
Considering the time between last vaccination and the occurrence of Kawasaki’s disease the 
assessment of it being unrelated to vaccination is endorsed. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This phase III open label randomised trial assessed the impact of concomitant administration of 
MenACWY with rMenB vs the administration of both vaccines alone, in healthy infants. 
Although questions could be raised surrounding an interim analysis, for which very little detail has 
been given, it is not expected to impact the conclusions of the trial significantly therefore no questions 
are raised.  
The data showed that the immune response following administration of MenACWY vaccine was higher 
or similar in the rMenB+ACWY group compared with that in the MenACWY group.  
The available safety data do not give rise to any concerns.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted a trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant administration of 
Menveo with a recombinant MenB vaccine in healthy infants. Non-inferiority of the combined vaccine 
rMenB+ACWY against the isolated vaccines rMenB or MenACWY was demonstrated. The study 
demonstrates an acceptable and comparable safety profile when the vaccines are given concomitantly.   
The MAH proposes no changes.  
MS1 proposed that the MAH submits a type II variation to include MenB vaccine under 4.5, which was 
supported by MS2. The Rapporteur agrees.  
It is agreed that the B/R balance for Menveo remains unchanged. 
  Fulfilled: 
The MAH should submit a type II variation to include concomitant administration with MenB in section 
4.5

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Cerdelga is indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), 
who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive metabolisers 
(EMs). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Therapy with Cerdelga should be initiated and supervised by a physician knowledgeable in the 
management of Gaucher disease. 
Posology   
The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) 
and extensive metabolisers (EMs). The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat once daily in CYP2D6 
poor metabolisers (PMs).  
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the prescribed dose should be taken at the next scheduled time; the next dose 
should not be doubled. 
Special populations 
CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers (URMs) and indeterminate metabolisers 
Eliglustat should not be used in patients who are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolisers (URMs) or 
indeterminate metabolisers (see section 4.4).

Patients with hepatic impairment 
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, 
eliglustat is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), 
eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no 
dosage adjustment is required and the recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily.  
In CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs) with any degree of hepatic 
impairment, eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate hepatic impairment taking a strong 
or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, Cerdelga is contraindicated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).  
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment taking a weak CYP2D6 
inhibitor or a strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor, a dose of 84 mg eliglustat once daily should 
be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, no dosage 
adjustment is required and the recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
In CYP2D6 EMs with end stage renal disease (ESRD), eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2).     
In CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs) with mild, moderate or 
severe renal impairment or ESRD, eliglustat is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Elderly  
There is limited experience in the treatment of elderly with eliglustat. Data indicates that no dosage 
adjustment is considered necessary (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Cerdelga in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years has not been 
established. No data are available.  
Method of administration 
Cerdelga is to be taken orally. The capsules should be swallowed whole, preferably with water, and 
should not be crushed, dissolved, or opened.  
The capsules may be taken with or without food. Consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be 
avoided (see section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive metabolisers (EMs) taking a 
strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor, and 
patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Use of Cerdelga 
under these conditions results in substantially elevated eliglustat plasma concentrations (see 
section 4.4 and 4.5). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to significantly increased eliglustat plasma concentrations, Cerdelga is contraindicated in 
CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe hepatic impairment and in CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate hepatic impairment taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 
inhibitor (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Initiation of therapy: CYP2D6 genotyping 
Before initiation of treatment with Cerdelga, patients should be genotyped for CYP2D6 to determine 
the CYP2D6 metaboliser status (see section 4.2, Special populations). 
Drug-drug interactions 
Cerdelga is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive 
metabolisers (EMs) taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong  or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor, and in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.3).  
For use of eliglustat with one strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 or CYP3A, see section 4.5. 
Use of eliglustat with strong CYP3A inducers substantially decreases the exposure to eliglustat, which 
may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of eliglustat; therefore concomitant administration is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions 
Use of eliglustat in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions has not been studied during clinical 
trials. Because eliglustat is predicted to cause mild increases in ECG intervals at substantially elevated 
plasma concentrations, use of eliglustat should be avoided in patients with cardiac disease (congestive 
heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular arrhythmia), 
long QT syndrome, and in combination with Class IA (e.g. quinidine) and Class III (e.g. amiodarone, 
sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Limited data are available in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Use of eliglustat in these patients is not recommended (see sections 4.2. and 5.2). 
Limited or no data are available in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or poor metabolisers 
(PMs) with any degree of hepatic impairment. Use of eliglustat in these patients is not recommended 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Concomitant use of eliglustat with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers 
(EMs) with mild hepatic impairment can result in further elevation of eliglustat plasma concentrations, 
with the magnitude of the effect depending on the enzyme inhibited and the potency of the inhibitor. 
In CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment taking a weak CYP2D6 
inhibitor or strong, moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor, a dose of  84 mg eliglustat mg once daily 
should be considered (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Limited or no data are available in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs), intermediate metabolisers 
(IMs) or poor metabolisers (PMs)  with ESRD and in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or 
poor metabolisers (PMs) with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment; use of eliglustat in these 
patients is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Monitoring of clinical response 
Some treatment-naïve patients showed less than 20% spleen volume reduction (sub-optimal results) 
after 9 months of treatment (see section 5.1). For these patients, monitoring for further improvement or 
an alternative treatment modality should be considered. 
For patients with stable disease who switch from enzyme replacement therapy to eliglustat, monitoring 
for disease progression (e.g. after 6 months with regular monitoring thereafter) should be performed 
for all disease domains to evaluate disease stability. Reinstitution of enzyme replacement therapy or an 
alternative treatment modality should be considered in individual patients who have a sub-optimal 
response. 
Lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Eliglustat is metabolised primarily by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Concomitant 
administration of substances affecting CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity may alter eliglustat plasma 
concentrations. Eliglustat is an inhibitor of P-gp and CYP2D6 in vitro; concomitant administration of 
eliglustat with P-gp or CYP2D6 substrate substances may increase the plasma concentration of those 
substances. 
The list of substances in section 4.5 is not an inclusive list and the prescriber is advised to consult the 
SmPC of all other prescribed medicinal products for potential drug-drug interactions with eliglustat. 
Agents that may increase eliglustat exposure 
Cerdelga is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive 
metabolisers (EMs) taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor concomitantly with a strong or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor , and in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.3). Use of Cerdelga under these conditions results in substantially 
elevated eliglustat plasma concentrations.  
CYP2D6 inhibitors 
In intermediate (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs): 
After repeated 84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in non-PMs, concomitant administration with 
repeated 30 mg once daily doses of paroxetine, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in a 7.3- and 
8.9-fold increase in eliglustat Cmax and AUC0-12, respectively. A dose of eliglustat 84 mg once daily 
should be considered when a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, 
bupropion) is used concomitantly in IMs and EMs. 
At 84 mg twice daily dosing with eliglustat in non-PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of 
moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. duloxetine, terbinafine, moclobemide, mirabegron, cinacalcet, 
dronedarone) would increase eliglustat exposure approximately up to 4-fold. Caution should be used 
with moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors in IMs and EMs. 
In extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild or moderate hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 
4.4.  
In extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2 and 4.3. 
CYP3A inhibitors 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In intermediate (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs): 
After repeated 84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in non-PMs, concomitant administration with 
repeated 400 mg once daily doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, resulted in a 3.8 and 
4.3-fold increase in eliglustat Cmax and AUC0-12, respectively; similar effects would be expected for 
other strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, cobicistat, 
indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, posaconazole, voriconazole, 
telithromycin, conivaptan, boceprevir). Caution should be used with strong CYP3A inhibitors in IMs 
and EMs. 
At 84 mg twice daily dosing with eliglustat in non-PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, 
aprepitant, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, imatinib, cimetidine) would increase eliglustat 
exposure approximately up to 3-fold. Caution should be used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors in IMs 
and EMs. 
In extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2 and 4.4.  
In extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate or severe hepatic impairment: see sections 4.2 and 4.3. 
In poor metabolisers (PMs): 
At 84 mg once daily dosing with eliglustat in PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of strong 
CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole, cobicistat, indinavir, lopinavir, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, conivaptan, 
boceprevir) would increase the Cmax and AUC0-24 of eliglustat 4.3- and 6.2-fold. The use of strong 
CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated in PMs. 
At 84 mg once daily dosing with eliglustat in PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, aprepitant, 
atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, imatinib, cimetidine) would increase the Cmax and AUC0-24 of 
eliglustat 2.4- and 3.0-fold, respectively. Use of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with eliglustat is not 
recommended in PMs. 
Caution should be used with weak CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. amlodipine, cilostazol, fluvoxamine, 
goldenseal, isoniazid, ranitidine, ranolazine) in PMs. 
CYP2D6 inhibitors used simultaneously with CYP3A inhibitors 
In intermediate (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs): 
At 84 mg twice daily dosing with eliglustat in non-PMs, it is predicted that the concomitant use of 
strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors would increase Cmax 
and AUC0-12 up to 17- and 25-fold, respectively. The use of a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor 
concomitantly with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is contraindicated in IMs and EMs. 
Grapefruit products contain one or more components that inhibit CYP3A and can increase plasma 
concentrations of eliglustat. Consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be avoided. 
Agents that may decrease eliglustat exposure 
Strong CYP3A inducers 
After repeated 127 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in non-PMs, concomitant administration of 
repeated 600 mg once daily doses of rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A as well as the efflux 
transporter P-gp) resulted in an approximately 85% decrease in eliglustat exposure. After repeated 
84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in PMs, concomitant administration of repeated 600 mg once 
daily doses of rifampicin resulted in an approximately 95% decrease in eliglustat exposure. Use of a 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
strong CYP3A inducer (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin and St. 
John’s wort) with eliglustat is not recommended in IMs, EMs and PMs. 
Agents whose exposure may be increased by eliglustat 
P-gp substrates 
After a single 0.25 mg dose of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, concomitant administration of 127 mg twice 
daily doses of eliglustat resulted in a 1.7- and 1.5-fold increase in digoxin Cmax and AUClast, 
respectively. Lower doses of substances which are P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, colchicine, 
dabigatran, phenytoin, pravastatin) may be required. 
CYP2D6 substrates 
After a single 50 mg dose of metoprolol, a CYP2D6 substrate, concomitant administration of repeated 
127 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat resulted in a 1.5- and 2.1-fold increase in metoprolol Cmax and 
AUC, respectively. Lower doses of medicinal products that are CYP2D6 substrates may be required. 
These include certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. nortriptyline, amitriptyline, 
imipramine, and desipramine), phenothiazines, dextromethorphan and atomoxetine). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of eliglustat in pregnant women. Animal studies 
do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is recommended to avoid the use of Cerdelga during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether eliglustat or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of eliglustat in milk (see section 
5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Cerdelga therapy taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Effects on testes and reversible inhibition of spermatogenesis were observed in rats (see section 5.3). 
The relevance of these findings for humans is not known. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cerdelga has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The overall adverse reaction profile of Cerdelga is based on 1400 patient-years of treatment exposure 
and pooled results from the primary analysis periods and extension periods of two pivotal Phase 3 
studies (ENGAGE and ENCORE), one 8-year, long term Phase 2 study (Study 304) and one 
supporting Phase 3b study (EDGE). In these four studies a total of 393 patients between the ages of 
16-75 years received eliglustat for a median duration of 3.5 years (up to 9.3 years). 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction with Cerdelga is dyspepsia, in approximately 6% of the 
clinical trial patients.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest eliglustat plasma concentration observed to date occurred in a Phase 1 single-dose dose 
escalation study in healthy subjects, in a subject taking a dose equivalent to approximately 21 times 
the recommended dose for GD1 patients. At the time of the highest plasma concentration (59-fold 
higher than normal therapeutic conditions), the subject experienced dizziness marked by 
disequilibrium, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting. 
In the event of acute overdose, the patient should be carefully observed and given symptomatic 
treatment and supportive care.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties

and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX10. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Eliglustat is a potent and specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, and acts as a substrate 
reduction therapy (SRT) for GD1. SRT aims to reduce the rate of synthesis of the major substrate 
glucosylceramide (GL-1) to match its impaired rate of catabolism in patients with GD1, thereby 
preventing glucosylceramide accumulation and alleviating clinical manifestations. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In clinical trials in treatment-naïve GD1 patients, plasma GL-1 levels were elevated in the majority of 
these patients and decreased upon Cerdelga treatment. Additionally, in a clinical trial in GD1 patients 
stabilised on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (i.e. having already achieved therapeutic goals on 
ERT prior to initiating Cerdelga treatment), plasma GL-1 levels were normal in most patients and 
decreased upon Cerdelga treatment. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The recommended dosing regimens (see section 4.2) are based on modelling, either of PK/PD data 
from the dose-titration regimens applied in the clinical studies for IMs and EMs, or physiologically-
based PK data for PMs. 
Pivotal study of Cerdelga in treatment-naïve GD1 patients – study 02507(ENGAGE) 
Study 02507 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study in 
40 patients with GD1. In the Cerdelga group 3 (15%) patients received a starting dose of 42 mg 
eliglustat twice daily during the 9-month primary analysis period and 17 (85%) patients received a 
dose escalation to 84 mg twice daily based on plasma trough concentration.

Long-term clinical outcomes in treatment-naïve GD1 patients – study 304 
Study 304 was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of Cerdelga in 26 patients. Nineteen 
patients completed 4 years of treatment. Fifteen (79%) of these patients received a dose escalation to 
84 mg eliglustat twice daily; 4 (21%) patients continued to receive 42 mg twice daily.   
Eighteen patients completed 8 years of treatment. One patient (6%) received a further dose escalation 
to 127 mg twice daily. Fourteen (78%) continued on 84 mg Cerdelga twice daily. Three (17%) patients 
continued to receive 42 mg twice daily. Sixteen patients had an efficacy endpoint assessment at year 8. 
Cerdelga showed sustained improvements in organ volume and haematological parameters over the 8 
year treatment period (see Table 3).

Pivotal study of Cerdelga in GD1 patients switching from ERT– Study 02607 (ENCORE) 
Study 02607 was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, non-inferiority, multicenter clinical 
study in 159 patients previously stabilised with ERT. In the Cerdelga group 34 (32%) patients received 
a dose escalation to 84 mg eliglustat twice daily and 51 (48%) to 127 mg twice daily during the 12-
month primary analysis period , and 21 (20%) patients continued to receive 42 mg twice daily. 
Based on the aggregate data from all doses tested in this study, Cerdelga met the criteria set in this 
study to be declared non-inferior to Cerezyme (imiglucerase) in maintaining patient stability. After 12 
months of treatment, the percentage of patients meeting the primary composite endpoint (composed of 
all four components mentioned in Table 4) was 84.8% [95% confidence interval 76.2% - 91.3%] for 
the Cerdelga group compared to 93.6% [95% confidence interval 82.5% - 98.7 %] for the Cerezyme 
group. Of the patients who did not meet stability criteria for the individual components, 12 of 15 
Cerdelga patients and 3 of 3 Cerezyme patients remained within therapeutic goals for GD1. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences between groups for any of the four individual disease

During the open-label long term treatment period with Cerdelga (extension phase) the percentage of 
patients with complete data meeting the composite stability endpoint was maintained at 84.6% 
(n=136) after 2 years, 84.4% (n=109) after 3 years and 91.1% (n=45) after 4 years. The majority of 
extension phase discontinuations were due to transition to commercial product from year 3 onwards. 
Individual disease parameters of spleen volume, liver volume, haemoglobin levels and platelet count 
remained stable through 4 years (see Table 5).

Clinical experience in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) and ultra-rapid metabolisers (URMs) 
There is limited experience with Cerdelga treatment of patients who are PMs or URMs. In the primary 
analysis periods of the three clinical studies, a total of 5 PMs and 5 URMs were treated with Cerdelga. 
All PMs received 42 mg eliglustat twice daily, and four of these (80%) had an adequate clinical 
response. The majority of URMs (80%) received a dose escalation to 127 mg eliglustat twice daily, all 
of which had adequate clinical responses. The one URM who received 84 mg twice daily did not have 
an adequate response. 
The predicted exposures with 84 mg eliglustat once daily in patients who are PMs are expected to be 
similar to exposures observed with 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers 
(IMs). Patients who are URMs may not achieve adequate concentrations to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. No dosing recommendation for URMs can be given. 
Effects on skeletal pathology 
After 9 months of treatment, in Study 02507, bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, as determined 
by the total Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) score (assessed by MRI in lumbar spine and femur) 
decreased by a mean of 1.1 points in Cerdelga treated patients (n=19) compared to no change in 
patients receiving placebo (n=20). Five Cerdelga-treated patients (26%) achieved a reduction of at 
least 2 points in the BMB score.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After 18 and 30 months of treatment, BMB score had decreased by a mean 2.2 points (n=18) and 2.7 
(n=15), respectively for the patients originally randomised to Cerdelga, compared to a mean decrease 
of 1 point (n=20) and 0.8 (n=16) in those originally randomised to placebo.  
After 18 months of Cerdelga treatment in the open-label extension phase, the mean (SD) lumbar spine 
Bone Mineral Density T-score increased from -1.14 (1.0118) at Baseline (n=34) to -0.918 
(1.1601) (n=33) in the normal range. After 30 months and 4.5 years of treatment, the T-score further 
increased to -0.722 (1.1250) (n=27) and -0.533 (0.8031) (n=9), respectively.  
Results of study 304 indicate that skeletal improvements are maintained or continue to improve during 
at least 8 years of treatment with Cerdelga. 
In study 02607, lumbar spine and femur BMD T- and Z-scores were maintained within the normal 
range in patients treated with Cerdelga for up to 4 years. 
Electrocardiographic evaluation 
No clinically significant QTc prolonging effect of eliglustat was observed for single doses up to 
675 mg. 
Heart-rate corrected QT interval using Fridericia's correction (QTcF) was evaluated in a randomized, 
placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, single-dose study in 47 healthy 
subjects. In this trial with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-
sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTcF was below 
10 msec, the threshold for regulatory concern. While there was no apparent effect on heart rate, 
concentration-related increases were observed for the placebo corrected change from baseline in the 
PR, QRS, and QTc intervals. Based on PK/PD modelling, eliglustat plasma concentrations 11-fold the 
predicted human Cmax are expected to cause mean (upper bound of the 95% confidence interval) 
increases in the PR, QRS, and QTcF intervals of 18.8 (20.4), 6.2 (7.1), and 12.3 (14.2) msec, 
respectively. 
Elderly 
A limited number of patients aged 65 years (n=10) and over were enrolled in clinical trials. No 
significant differences were found in the efficacy and safety profiles of elderly patients and younger 
patients. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cerdelga in all subsets of the paediatric population in Gaucher disease Type 2 (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Cerdelga in the subsets of the paediatric population from 24 months to less than 18 years in Gaucher 
disease Type 1 and Type 3 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Median time to reach maximum plasma concentrations occurs between 1.5 to 6 hours after dosing, 
with low oral bioavailability (<5%) due to significant first-pass metabolism. Eliglustat is a substrate of 
the efflux transporter P-gp. Food does not have a clinically relevant effect on eliglustat 
pharmacokinetics. Following repeated dosing of eliglustat 84 mg twice daily in non-PMs and once 
daily in PMs, steady state was reached by 4 days, with an accumulation ratio of 3-fold or less.   
Distribution 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eliglustat is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (76 to 83%) and is mainly distributed in 
plasma.  After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution was 816 L, suggesting wide 
distribution to tissues in humans. Nonclinical studies demonstrated a wide distribution of eliglustat to 
tissues, including bone marrow. 
Biotransformation 
Eliglustat is extensively metabolized with high clearance, mainly by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent 
CYP3A4. Primary metabolic pathways of eliglustat involve sequential oxidation of the octanoyl 
moiety followed by oxidation of the 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxane moiety, or a combination of the 
two pathways, resulting in multiple oxidative metabolites. 
Elimination 
After oral administration, the majority of the administered dose is excreted in urine (41.8%) and 
faeces (51.4%), mainly as metabolites. After intravenous administration, eliglustat total body 
clearance was 86 L/h. After repeated oral doses of 84 mg eliglustat twice daily, eliglustat elimination 
half-life is approximately 4-7 hours in non-PMs and 9 hours in PMs. 
Characteristics in specific groups 
CYP2D6 phenotype 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis shows that the CYP2D6 predicted phenotype based on genotype 
is the most important factor affecting pharmacokinetic variability. Individuals with a CYP2D6 poor 
metaboliser predicted phenotype (approximately 5 to 10% of the population) exhibit higher eliglustat 
concentrations than intermediate or extensive CYP2D6 metabolisers. 
Gender, body weight, age, and race 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender, body weight, age, and race had limited or 
no impact on the pharmacokinetics of eliglustat. 
Hepatic impairment:    
Effects of mild and moderate hepatic impairment were evaluated in a single dose phase 1 study. After 
a single 84 mg dose, eliglustat Cmax and AUC were 1.2- and 1.2-fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment, and 2.8- and 5.2-fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolisers (EMs).  
After repeated 84 mg twice daily doses of Cerdelga, Cmax and AUC0-12 are predicted to be 2.4- and 2.9-
fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with mild hepatic impairment and 6.4- and 8.9-
fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment compared to 
healthy CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs). 
After repeated 84 mg once daily doses of Cerdelga, Cmax and AUC0-24 are predicted to be 3.1- and 3.2 -
fold higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with moderate hepatic impairment compared to 
healthy CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs ) receiving Cerdelga 84 mg twice daily (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4).  
Steady state PK exposure could not be predicted in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) and poor 
metabolisers (PMs) with mild and moderate hepatic impairment due to limited or no single-dose data. 
The effect of severe hepatic impairment was not studied in subjects with any CYP2D6 phenotype (see 
sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment:   
Effect of severe renal impairment was evaluated in a single dose phase 1 study. After a single 84 mg 
dose, eliglustat Cmax and AUC were similar in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs) with severe 
renal impairment and healthy CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers (EMs).  
Limited or no data were available in patients with ESRD and in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers 
(IMs) or poor metabolisers(PMs)  with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The principal target organs for eliglustat in toxicology studies are the GI tract, lymphoid organs, the 
liver in rat only and, in the male rat only, the reproductive system. Effects of eliglustat in toxicology 
studies were reversible and exhibited no evidence of delayed or recurring toxicity. Safety margins for 
the chronic rat and dog studies ranged between 8-fold and 15-fold using total plasma exposure and 1- 
to 2-fold using unbound (free fraction) plasma exposures. 
Eliglustat did not have effects on CNS or respiratory functions. Concentration-dependent cardiac 
effects were observed in nonclinical studies: inhibition of human cardiac ion channels, including 
potassium, sodium, and calcium, at concentrations ≥ 7-fold of predicted human Cmax; sodium ion 
channel-mediated effects in an ex-vivo electrophysiology study in dog Purkinje fibres (2-fold of 
predicted human unbound plasma Cmax); and increases in QRS and PR intervals in dog telemetry and 
cardiac conduction studies in anaesthesised dogs, with effects seen at concentrations 14-fold of 
predicted human total plasma Cmax, or 2-fold of predicted human unbound plasma Cmax. 
Eliglustat was not mutagenic in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests and did not show any 
carcinogenic potential in standard lifetime bioassays in mice and rats. Exposures in the carcinogenicity 
studies were approximately 4-fold and 3-fold greater in mice and rats, respectively, than the mean 
predicted human eliglustat total plasma exposure, or less than 1-fold using unbound plasma exposure. 
In mature male rats, no effects on sperm parameters were observed at systemically non-toxic doses. 
Reversible inhibition of spermatogenesis was observed in the rat at 10-fold of predicted human 
exposure based on AUC, a systemically toxic dose. In rat repeated dose toxicity studies, seminiferous 
epithelial degeneration and segmental hypoplasia of the testes was seen at 10-fold of predicted human 
exposure based on AUC. 
Placental transfer of eliglustat and its metabolites was shown in the rat. At 2 and 24 hours post-dose, 
0.034 % and 0.013 % of labelled dose was detected in foetal tissue, respectively. 
At maternal toxic doses in rats, foetuses showed a higher incidence of dilated cerebral ventricles, 
abnormal number of ribs or lumbar vertebrae, and many bones showed poor ossification. 
Embryofoetal development in rats and rabbits was not affected up to clinically relevant exposure 
(based on AUC). 
A lactation study in the rat showed that 0.23% of labelled dose was transferred to pups during 24 
hours post-dose, indicating milk excretion of eliglustat and/or its related materials.

Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Cerdelga in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Cerdelga is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals who are expected to prescribe Cerdelga are provided with a prescriber guide.  
The prescriber guide shall contain the following key elements: 
o  Cerdelga is indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease 
type 1 (GD1).  
o  Before initiation of treatment with Cerdelga, patients should be genotyped for CYP2D6 to 
determine the CYP2D6 metaboliser status. Cerdelga is indicated in patients who are 
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs), intermediate metabolisers (IMs) or extensive 
metabolisers (EMs). 
o  The recommended dose is 84 mg eliglustat twice daily in CYP2D6 intermediate 
metabolisers (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs). The recommended dose is 84 mg 
eliglustat once daily in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs).  
o  Patients should be informed that consumption of grapefruit or its juice should be avoided. 
o  Eliglustat is contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolisers (IMs) 
or extensive metabolisers (EMs) who are taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor 
concomitantly with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor.  Eliglustat is also 
contraindicated in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PMs) taking a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor. Use of eliglustat under these conditions results in substantially elevated 
plasma concentrations of eliglustat. This may cause mild increases in the PR, QRS, and 
QTc intervals. 
o  Use of eliglustat with strong CYP3A inducers substantially decreases the exposure to 
eliglustat, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness; therefore concomitant 
administration is not recommended. Use of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with eliglustat is 
not recommended in PMs. 
o  A dose of eliglustat 84 mg once daily should be considered when a strong CYP2D6 
inhibitor is used concomitantly in intermediate metabolisers (IMs) and extensive 
metabolisers (EMs). 
o  Caution should be used with moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors in intermediate metabolisers 
(IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs). Caution should be used with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors in intermediate metabolisers (IMs) and extensive metabolisers (EMs). 
Caution should be used with weak CYP3A inhibitors in poor metabolisers (PMs).

3.  How to take Cerdelga

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cerdelga is and what it is used for 
Cerdelga contains the active substance eliglustat and is used for the long term treatment of adult 
patients with Gaucher disease type 1. 
Gaucher disease type 1 is a rare, inherited condition in which a substance called glucosylceramide is 
not effectively broken down by your body. As a result glucosylceramide builds up in your spleen, liver 
and bones. The build-up prevents these organs from working properly. Cerdelga contains the active 
substance eliglustat which decreases the production of glucosylceramide, thereby preventing its build-
up. In turn this helps your affected organs to work better. 
People differ in the speed that their body breaks down this medicine. As a result the amount of this 
medicine in the blood can differ between patients which could affect how a patient would respond. 
Cerdelga is meant to be used in patients whose body breaks down this medicine at normal speed 
(known as intermediate metabolisers and extensive metabolisers) or slow speed (known as poor 
metabolisers). Your doctor will determine if Cerdelga is suitable for you before you start taking it, 
using a simple laboratory test. 
Gaucher disease type 1 is a lifelong condition and you must continue to take this medicine as 
prescribed by your doctor to gain the maximum benefit from your medicine. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Cerdelga  
Do not take Cerdelga 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to eliglustat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are an intermediate or extensive metaboliser and use medicines  known as strong or 
moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (examples are quinidine and terbinafine) used in combination 
with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (examples are erythromycin and itraconazole). The 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combination of these medicines will interfere with your body’s ability to break down Cerdelga 
and this can result in higher levels of the active substance in your blood (see the section ‘Other 
medicines and Cerdelga’ for an expanded list of medicines). 
If you are a poor metaboliser and use medicines known as strong CYP3A inhibitors (for 
example itraconazole). Medicines of this type will interfere with your body’s abilty to break 
down Cerdelga and this can result in higher levels of the active substance in your blood (see 
the section ‘Other medicines and Cerdelga’ for an expanded list of medicines). 
If you are an extensive metaboliser and you have severely reduced liver function. 
If you are an extensive metaboliser and you have mildly or moderately reduced liver function 
while taking a strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor.

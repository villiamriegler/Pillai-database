CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Protopic 0.03% ointment is indicated in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 2 years. 
Flare treatment 
Adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above) 
Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or 
are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids.  
Children (2 years of age and above) 
Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children who failed to respond adequately to 
conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. 
Maintenance treatment 
Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for the prevention of flares and the prolongation of 
flare-free intervals in patients experiencing a high frequency of disease exacerbations (i.e. occurring 4 
or more times per year) who have had an initial response to a maximum of 6 weeks treatment of twice 
daily tacrolimus ointment (lesions cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Protopic treatment should be initiated by physicians with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of 
atopic dermatitis. 
Protopic is available in two strengths, Protopic 0.03% and Protopic 0.1% ointment. 
Posology 
Flare treatment 
Protopic can be used for short-term and intermittent long-term treatment. Treatment should not be 
continuous on a long-term basis. 
Protopic treatment should begin at the first appearance of signs and symptoms. Each affected region of 
the skin should be treated with Protopic until lesions are cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected.

Thereafter, patients are considered suitable for maintenance treatment (see below). At the first signs of 
recurrence (flares) of the disease symptoms, treatment should be re-initiated. 
Adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above) 
Treatment should be started with Protopic 0.1% twice a day and treatment should be continued until 
clearance of the lesion. If symptoms recur, twice daily treatment with Protopic 0.1% should be 
restarted. An attempt should be made to reduce the frequency of application or to use the lower 
strength Protopic 0.03% ointment if the clinical condition allows. 
Generally, improvement is seen within one week of starting treatment. If no signs of improvement are 
seen after two weeks of treatment, further treatment options should be considered. 
Elderly 
Specific studies have not been conducted in older people. However, the clinical experience available 
in this patient population has not shown the necessity for any dosage adjustment. 
Paediatric population 
Children (2 years of age and above) should use the lower strength Protopic 0.03% ointment. 
Treatment should be started twice a day for up to three weeks. Afterwards the frequency of application 
should be reduced to once a day until clearance of the lesion (see section 4.4). 
Protopic ointment should not be used in children aged below 2 years until further data are available. 
Maintenance treatment 
Patients who are responding to up to 6 weeks treatment using tacrolimus ointment twice daily (lesions 
cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected) are suitable for maintenance treatment. 
Adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above) 
Adult patients should use Protopic 0.1% ointment.  
Protopic ointment should be applied once a day twice weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas 
commonly affected by atopic dermatitis to prevent progression to flares. Between applications there 
should be 2–3 days without Protopic treatment. 
After 12 months treatment, a review of the patient`s condition should be conducted by the physician 
and a decision taken whether to continue maintenance treatment in the absence of safety data for 
maintenance treatment beyond 12 months. 
If signs of a flare reoccur, twice daily treatment should be re-initiated (see flare treatment section 
above). 
Elderly 
Specific studies have not been conducted in older people (see flare treatment section above). 
Paediatric population 
Children (2 years of age and above) should use the lower strength Protopic 0.03% ointment. 
Protopic ointment should be applied once a day twice weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas 
commonly affected by atopic dermatitis to prevent progression to flares. Between applications there 
should be 2–3 days without Protopic treatment. 
The review of the child`s condition after 12 months treatment should include suspension of treatment 
to assess the need to continue this regimen and to evaluate the course of the disease. 
Protopic ointment should not be used in children aged below 2 years until further data are available. 
Method of administration 
Protopic ointment should be applied as a thin layer to affected or commonly affected areas of the skin. 
Protopic ointment may be used on any part of the body, including face, neck and flexure areas, except 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on mucous membranes. Protopic ointment should not be applied under occlusion because this method 
of administration has not been studied in patients (see section 4.4).  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, macrolides in general, or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Exposure of the skin to sunlight should be minimised and the use of ultraviolet (UV) light from a 
solarium, therapy with UVB or UVA in combination with psoralens (PUVA) should be avoided 
during use of Protopic ointment (see section 5.3). Physicians should advise patients on appropriate sun 
protection methods, such as minimisation of the time in the sun, use of a sunscreen product and 
covering of the skin with appropriate clothing. Protopic ointment should not be applied to lesions that 
are considered to be potentially malignant or pre-malignant. The development of any new change 
different from previous eczema within a treated area should be reviewed by the physician. 
The use of tacrolimus ointment is not recommended in patients with a skin barrier defect, such as 
Netherton’s syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, generalized erythroderma, pyoderma gangrenosum or 
cutaneous Graft Versus Host Disease. These skin conditions may increase systemic absorption of 
tacrolimus. Post-marketing cases of increased tacrolimus blood level have been reported in these 
conditions. Protopic should not be used in patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies or 
in patients on therapy that cause immunosuppression. 
Care should be exercised if applying Protopic to patients with extensive skin involvement over an 
extended period of time, especially in children (see section 4.2). Patients, particularly paediatric 
patients should be continuously evaluated during treatment with Protopic with respect to the response 
to treatment and the continuing need for treatment. After 12 months this evaluation should include 
suspension of Protopic treatment in paediatric patients (see section 4.2). The effect of treatment with 
Protopic ointment on the developing immune system of children aged below 2 years has not been 
established (see section 4.1). 
Protopic contains the active substance tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor. In transplant patients, 
prolonged systemic exposure to intense immunosuppression following systemic administration of 
calcineurin inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas and skin 
malignancies. Patients with atopic dermatitis treated with Protopic have not been found to have 
significant systemic tacrolimus levels and the role of local immunosuppression is unknown. 
Based on the results of long-term studies and experience, a link between Protopic ointment treatment 
and development of malignancies has not been confirmed, but definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. 
It is recommended to use tacrolimus ointment at the lowest strength and the lowest frequency for the 
shortest duration necessary as determined by the physician’s evaluation of the clinical condition (see 
section 4.2). 
Lymphadenopathy was uncommonly (0.8%) reported in clinical trials. The majority of these cases 
were related to infections (skin, respiratory tract, tooth) and resolved with appropriate antibiotic 
therapy. Lymphadenopathy present at initiation of therapy should be investigated and kept under 
review. In case of persistent lymphadenopathy, the aetiology of the lymphadenopathy should be 
investigated. In the absence of a clear aetiology for the lymphadenopathy or in the presence of acute 
infectious mononucleosis, discontinuation of Protopic should be considered. Patients who develop 
lymphadenopathy during treatment should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves. 
Patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections. Protopic ointment has not 
been evaluated for its efficacy and safety in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis. 
Before commencing treatment with Protopic ointment, clinical infections at treatment sites should be 
cleared. Treatment with Protopic is associated with an increased risk of folliculitis and herpes viral 
infections (herpes simplex dermatitis [eczema herpeticum], herpes simplex [cold sores], Kaposi’s 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
varicelliform eruption) (see section 4.8). In the presence of these infections, the balance of risks and 
benefits associated with Protopic use should be evaluated. 
Emollients should not be applied to the same area within 2 hours of applying Protopic ointment. 
Concomitant use of other topical preparations has not been assessed. There is no experience with 
concomitant use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. 
Care should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. If accidentally applied to 
these areas, the ointment should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water.  
The use of Protopic ointment under occlusion has not been studied in patients. Occlusive dressings are 
not recommended.  
As with any topical medicinal product, patients should wash their hands after application if the hands 
are not intended for treatment.  
Tacrolimus is extensively metabolised in the liver and although blood concentrations are low 
following topical therapy, the ointment should be used with caution in patients with hepatic failure 
(see section 5.2).  
Excipients warnings 
Protopic ointment contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321) as an excipient, which may cause local skin 
reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Formal topical drug interaction studies with tacrolimus ointment have not been conducted. 
Tacrolimus is not metabolised in human skin, indicating that there is no potential for percutaneous 
interactions that could affect the metabolism of tacrolimus. 
Systemically available tacrolimus is metabolised via the hepatic Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). 
Systemic exposure from topical application of tacrolimus ointment is low (<1.0 ng/ml) and is unlikely 
to be affected by concomitant use of substances known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4. However, the 
possibility of interactions cannot be ruled out and the concomitant systemic administration of known 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and diltiazem) in patients with 
widespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution. 
Paediatric population 
An interaction study with protein-conjugated vaccine against Neisseria menigitidis serogroup C has 
been investigated in children aged 2-11 years. No effect on immediate response to vaccination, the 
generation of immune memory, or humoral and cell-mediated immunity has been observed (see 
section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of tacrolimus ointment in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see section 5.3). The potential 
risk for humans is unknown. 
Protopic ointment should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
Human data demonstrate that, after systemic administration, tacrolimus is excreted into breast milk. 
Although clinical data have shown that systemic exposure from application of tacrolimus ointment is 
low, breast-feeding during treatment with Protopic ointment is not recommended. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Protopic ointment has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
In clinical studies approximately 50% of patients experienced some type of skin irritation adverse 
reaction at the site of application. Burning sensation and pruritus were very common, usually mild to 
moderate in severity and tended to resolve within one week of starting treatment. Erythema was a 
common skin irritation adverse reaction. Sensation of warmth, pain, paraesthesia and rash at the site of 
application were also commonly observed. Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin irritation after 
consumption of an alcoholic beverage) was common. 
Patients may be at an increased risk of folliculitis, acne and herpes viral infections. 
Adverse reactions with suspected relationship to treatment are listed below by system organ class. 
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Maintenance treatment 
In a study of maintenance treatment (twice weekly treatment) in adults and children with moderate and 
severe atopic dermatitis the following adverse events were noted to occur more frequently than in the 
control group: application site impetigo (7.7% in children) and application site infections (6.4% in 
children and 6.3% in adults). 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are similar to those reported in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdosage following topical administration is unlikely.  
If ingested, general supportive measures may be appropriate. These may include monitoring of vital 
signs and observation of clinical status. Due to the nature of the ointment vehicle, induction of 
vomiting or gastric lavage is not recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents for dermatitis, excluding corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH01 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not fully understood. While the 
following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not 
known. 
Via its binding to a specific cytoplasmic immunophilin (FKBP12), tacrolimus inhibits calcium-
dependent signal transduction pathways in T cells, thereby preventing the transcription and synthesis 
of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and other cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-α and IFN-γ. 
In vitro, in Langerhans cells isolated from normal human skin, tacrolimus reduced the stimulatory 
activity towards T cells. Tacrolimus has also been shown to inhibit the release of inflammatory 
mediators from skin mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. 
In animals, tacrolimus ointment suppressed inflammatory reactions in experimental and spontaneous 
dermatitis models that resemble human atopic dermatitis. Tacrolimus ointment did not reduce skin 
thickness and did not cause skin atrophy in animals. 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, improvement of skin lesions during treatment with tacrolimus 
ointment was associated with reduced Fc receptor expression on Langerhans cells and a reduction of 
their hyperstimulatory activity towards T cells. Tacrolimus ointment does not affect collagen synthesis 
in humans.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy and safety of Protopic was assessed in more than 18,500 patients treated with tacrolimus 
ointment in Phase I to Phase III clinical trials. Data from six major trials are presented here. 
In a six-month multicentre double-blind randomised trial, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was administered 
twice-a-day to adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and compared to a topical 
corticosteroid based regimen (0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate on trunk and extremities, 1% 
hydrocortisone acetate on face and neck). The primary endpoint was the response rate at month 3 
defined as the proportion of patients with at least 60% improvement in the mEASI (modified Eczema 
Area and Severity Index) between baseline and month 3. The response rate in the 0.1% tacrolimus 
group (71.6%) was significantly higher than that in the topical corticosteroid based treatment group 
(50.8%; p<0.001; Table 1). The response rates at month 6 were comparable to the 3-month results.

§§ higher values = greater improvement 
The incidence and nature of most adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. Skin 
burning, herpes simplex, alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin sensitivity after alcohol intake), 
skin tingling, hyperaesthesia, acne and fungal dermatitis occurred more often in the tacrolimus 
treatment group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs in 
either treatment group throughout the study. 
In the second trial, children aged from 2 to 15 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received 
twice daily treatment for three weeks of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment or 1% 
hydrocortisone acetate ointment. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the 
mEASI as a percentage of baseline averaged over the treatment period. The results of this multicentre, 
double-blind, randomised trial showed that tacrolimus ointment, 0.03% and 0.1%, is significantly 
more effective (p<0.001 for both) than 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment (Table 2).

The incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the 
hydrocortisone group. Pruritus decreased over time in the tacrolimus groups but not in the 
hydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs 
in either treatment group throughout the clinical trial. 
The purpose of the third multicentre, double-blind, randomised study was the assessment of efficacy 
and safety of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice a day relative to twice daily

The primary endpoint was defined as the percentage decrease in mEASI from the baseline to end of 
treatment. A statistically significant better improvement was shown for once daily and twice daily 
0.03% tacrolimus ointment compared to twice daily hydrocortisone acetate ointment (p<0.001 for 
both). Twice daily treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment was more effective than once daily 
administration (Table 3). The incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment 
groups than in the hydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory 
values or vital signs in either treatment group throughout the study. 
In the fourth trial, approximately 800 patients (aged ≥2 years) received 0.1% tacrolimus ointment 
intermittently or continuously in an open-label, long-term safety study for up to four years, with 300 
patients receiving treatment for at least three years and 79 patients receiving treatment for a minimum 
of 42 months. Based on changes from baseline in EASI score and body surface area affected, patients 
regardless of age had improvement in their atopic dermatitis at all subsequent time points. In addition, 
there was no evidence of loss of efficacy throughout the duration of the clinical trial. The overall 
incidence of adverse events tended to decrease as the study progressed for all patients independent of 
age. The three most common adverse events reported were flu-like symptoms (cold, common cold, 
influenza, upper respiratory infection, etc.), pruritus and skin burning. No adverse events previously 
unreported in shorter duration and/or previous studies were observed in this long-term study. 
The efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment in maintenance treatment of mild to severe atopic 
dermatitis was assessed in 524 patients in two Phase III multicentre clinical trials of similar design, 
one in adult patients (≥16 years) and one in paediatric patients (2-15 years). In both studies, patients 
with active disease entered an open-label period (OLP) during which they treated affected lesions with 
tacrolimus ointment twice daily until improvement had reached a predefined score (Investigator’s 
Global Assessment [IGA] ≤2, i.e. clear, almost clear or mild disease) for a maximum of 6 weeks. 
Thereafter, patients entered a double-blind disease control period (DCP) for up to 12 months. Patients 
were randomised to receive either tacrolimus ointment (0.1% adults; 0.03% children) or vehicle, once 
a day twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays. If a disease exacerbation occurred, patients were 
treated with open-label tacrolimus ointment twice daily for a maximum of 6 weeks until the IGA score 
returned to ≤2. 
The primary endpoint in both studies was the number of disease exacerbations requiring a “substantial 
therapeutic intervention” during the DCP, defined as an exacerbation with an IGA of 3-5 (i.e. 
moderate, severe and very severe disease) on the first day of the flare, and requiring more than 7 days 
treatment. Both studies showed significant benefit with twice weekly treatment with tacrolimus 
ointment with regard to the primary and key secondary endpoints over a period of 12 months in a 
pooled population of patients with mild to severe atopic dermatitis. In a subanalysis of a pooled 
population of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis these differences remained 
statistically significant (Table 4). No adverse events not reported previously were observed in these 
studies.

A seven-month, double blind, randomised parallel group study of paediatric patients (2-11 years) with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis was performed. In one arm patients received Protopic 0.03% 
ointment (n=121) twice a day for 3 weeks and thereafter once a day until clearance. In the comparator 
arm patients received 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment (HA) for head and neck and 0.1% 
hydrocortisone butyrate ointment for trunk and limbs (n=111) twice a day for 2 weeks and 
subsequently HA twice a day to all affected areas. During this period all patients and control subjects 
(n=44) received a primary immunisation and a rechallenge with a protein-conjugate vaccine against 
Neisseria menigitidis serogroup C. 
The primary endpoint of this study was the response rate to vaccination, defined as the percentage of 
patients with a serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titre ≥8 at the week 5 visit. Analysis of the response 
rate at week 5 showed equivalence between the treatment groups (hydrocortisone 98.3%, tacrolimus 
ointment 95.4%; 7-11 years: 100% in both arms). The results in the control group were similar. 
The primary response to vaccination was not affected. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Clinical data have shown that tacrolimus concentrations in systemic circulation after topical 
administration are low and, when measurable, transient. 
Absorption 
Data from healthy human subjects indicate that there is little or no systemic exposure to tacrolimus 
following single or repeated topical application of tacrolimus ointment. 
Target trough concentrations for systemic immunosuppression for oral tacrolimus are 5-20 ng/mL in 
transplant patients. Most atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated 
application of tacrolimus ointment (0.03-0.1%), and infants from age of 5 months treated with 
tacrolimus ointment (0.03%) had blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/mL. When observed, blood 
concentrations exceeding 1.0 ng/mL were transient. Systemic exposure increases with increasing 
treatment areas. However, both the extent and the rate of topical absorption of tacrolimus decrease as 
the skin heals. In both adults and children with an average of 50% body surface area treated, systemic 
exposure (i.e. AUC) of tacrolimus from Protopic ointment is approximately 30-fold less than that seen 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with oral immunosuppressive doses in kidney and liver transplant patients. The lowest tacrolimus 
blood concentration at which systemic effects can be observed is not known.  
There was no evidence of systemic accumulation of tacrolimus in patients (adults and children) treated 
for prolonged periods (up to one year) with tacrolimus ointment.  
Distribution 
As systemic exposure is low with tacrolimus ointment, the high binding of tacrolimus (>98.8%) to 
plasma proteins is considered not to be clinically relevant. 
Following topical application of tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus is selectively delivered to the skin 
with minimal diffusion into the systemic circulation. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism of tacrolimus by human skin was not detectable. Systemically available tacrolimus is 
extensively metabolised in the liver via CYP3A4. 
Elimination 
When administered intravenously, tacrolimus has been shown to have a low clearance rate. The 
average total body clearance is approximately 2.25 l/h. The hepatic clearance of systemically available 
tacrolimus could be reduced in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, or in subjects who are co-
treated with drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
Following repeated topical application of the ointment the average half-life of tacrolimus was 
estimated to be 75 hours for adults and 65 hours for children. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus after topical application are similar to those reported in adults, 
with minimal systemic exposure and no evidence of accumulation (see above). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance 
Repeated topical administration of tacrolimus ointment or the ointment vehicle to rats, rabbits and 
micropigs was associated with slight dermal changes such as erythema, oedema and papules.  
Long-term topical treatment of rats with tacrolimus led to systemic toxicity including alterations of 
kidneys, pancreas, eyes and nervous system. The changes were caused by high systemic exposure of 
rodents resulting from high transdermal absorption of tacrolimus. Slightly lower body weight gain in 
females was the only systemic change observed in micropigs at high ointment concentrations (3%). 
Rabbits were shown to be especially sensitive to intravenous administration of tacrolimus, reversible 
cardiotoxic effects being observed. 
Mutagenicity 
In vitro and in vivo tests did not indicate a genotoxic potential of tacrolimus. 
Carcinogenicity 
Systemic carcinogenicity studies in mice (18 months) and rats (24 months) revealed no carcinogenic 
potential of tacrolimus.  
In a 24-month dermal carcinogenicity study performed in mice with 0.1% ointment, no skin tumours 
were observed. In the same study an increased incidence of lymphoma was detected in association 
with high systemic exposure. 
In a photocarcinogenicity study, albino hairless mice were chronically treated with tacrolimus ointment 
and UV radiation. Animals treated with tacrolimus ointment showed a statistically significant reduction 
in time to skin tumour (squamous cell carcinoma) development and an increase in the number of tumours. 
This effect occurred at the higher concentrations of 0.3% and 1%. The relevance to humans is currently 
unknown. It is unclear whether the effect of tacrolimus is due to systemic immunosuppression or a local 
effect. The risk for humans cannot be completely ruled out as the potential for local immunosuppression 
with the long-term use of tacrolimus ointment is unknown. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Reproduction toxicity 
Embryo/foetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits, but only at doses that caused significant 
toxicity in maternal animals. Reduced sperm function was noted in male rats at high subcutaneous 
doses of tacrolimus.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Protopic 0.1 % ointment is indicated in adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above)  
Flare treatment 
Adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above)  
Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are not adequately responsive to or 
are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids. 
Maintenance treatment 
Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for the prevention of flares and the prolongation of 
flare-free intervals in patients experiencing a high frequency of disease exacerbations (i.e. occurring 4 
or more times per year) who have had an initial response to a maximum of 6 weeks treatment of twice 
daily tacrolimus ointment (lesions cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Protopic treatment should be initiated by physicians with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of 
atopic dermatitis. 
Protopic is available in two strengths, Protopic 0.03 % and Protopic 0.1 % ointment. 
Posology 
Flare treatment 
Protopic can be used for short-term and intermittent long-term treatment. Treatment should not be 
continuous on a long-term basis. 
Protopic treatment should begin at the first appearance of signs and symptoms. Each affected region of 
the skin should be treated with Protopic until lesions are cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected. 
Thereafter, patients are considered suitable for maintenance treatment (see below). At the first signs of 
recurrence (flares) of the disease symptoms, treatment should be re-initiated. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above) 
Treatment should be started with Protopic 0.1% twice a day and treatment should be continued until 
clearance of the lesion. If symptoms recur, twice daily treatment with Protopic 0.1% should be 
restarted. An attempt should be made to reduce the frequency of application or to use the lower 
strength Protopic 0.03% ointment if the clinical condition allows.  
Generally, improvement is seen within one week of starting treatment. If no signs of improvement are 
seen after two weeks of treatment, further treatment options should be considered. 
Elderly 
Specific studies have not been conducted in older people. However, the clinical experience available 
in this patient population has not shown the necessity for any dosage adjustment. 
Paediatric population 
Only Protopic 0.03 % ointment should be used in children from the age of 2 to 16 years.  
Protopic ointment should not be used in children aged below 2 years until further data are available. 
Maintenance treatment 
Patients who are responding to up to 6 weeks treatment using tacrolimus ointment twice daily (lesions 
cleared, almost cleared or mildly affected) are suitable for maintenance treatment. 
Adults and adolescents (16 years of age and above) 
Adult patients (16 years of age and above) should use Protopic 0.1% ointment. Protopic ointment 
should be applied once a day twice weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas commonly affected 
by atopic dermatitis to prevent progression to flares. Between applications there should be 2–3 days 
without Protopic treatment. 
After 12 months treatment, a review of the patient`s condition should be conducted by the physician 
and a decision taken whether to continue maintenance treatment in the absence of safety data for 
maintenance treatment beyond 12 months.  
If signs of a flare reoccur, twice daily treatment should be re-initiated (see flare treatment section 
above). 
Elderly 
Specific studies have not been conducted in older people (see flare treatment section above). 
Paediatric population 
Only Protopic 0.03 % ointment should be used in children from the age of 2 to 16 years.  
Protopic ointment should not be used in children aged below 2 years until further data are available. 
Method of administration 
Protopic ointment should be applied as a thin layer to affected or commonly affected areas of the skin. 
Protopic ointment may be used on any part of the body, including face, neck and flexure areas, except 
on mucous membranes. Protopic ointment should not be applied under occlusion because this method 
of administration has not been studied in patients (see section 4.4).  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, macrolides in general, or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Exposure of the skin to sunlight should be minimised and the use of ultraviolet (UV) light from a 
solarium, therapy with UVB or UVA in combination with psoralens (PUVA) should be avoided 
during use of Protopic ointment (see section 5.3). Physicians should advise patients on appropriate sun 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protection methods, such as minimisation of the time in the sun, use of a sunscreen product and 
covering of the skin with appropriate clothing. Protopic ointment should not be applied to lesions that 
are considered to be potentially malignant or pre-malignant. The development of any new change 
different from previous eczema within a treated area should be reviewed by the physician. 
The use of tacrolimus ointment is not recommended in patients with a skin barrier defect, such as 
Netherton’s syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, generalized erythroderma, pyoderma gangrenosum or 
cutaneous Graft Versus Host Disease. These skin conditions may increase systemic absorption of 
tacrolimus. Post-marketing cases of increased tacrolimus blood level have been reported in these 
conditions. Protopic should not be used in patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies or 
in patients on therapy that cause immunosuppression. 
Care should be exercised if applying Protopic to patients with extensive skin involvement over an 
extended period of time, especially in children (see section 4.2). Patients, particularly paediatric 
patients should be continuously evaluated during treatment with Protopic with respect to the response 
to treatment and the continuing need for treatment. After 12 months this evaluation should include 
suspension of Protopic treatment in paediatric patients (see section 4.2).  
Protopic contains the active substance tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor. In transplant patients, 
prolonged systemic exposure to intense immunosuppression following systemic administration of 
calcineurin inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas and skin 
malignancies. Patients with atopic dermatitis treated with Protopic have not been found to have 
significant systemic tacrolimus levels and the role of local immunosuppression is unknown. 
Based on the results of long-term studies and experience, a link between Protopic ointment treatment 
and development of malignancies has not been confirmed, but definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. 
It is recommended to use tacrolimus ointment at the lowest strength and the lowest frequency for the 
shortest duration necessary as determined by the physician’s evaluation of the clinical condition (see 
section 4.2). 
Lymphadenopathy was uncommonly (0.8%) reported in clinical trials. The majority of these cases 
were related to infections (skin, respiratory tract, tooth) and resolved with appropriate antibiotic 
therapy. Lymphadenopathy present at initiation of therapy should be investigated and kept under 
review. In case of persistent lymphadenopathy, the aetiology of the lymphadenopathy should be 
investigated. In the absence of a clear aetiology for the lymphadenopathy or in the presence of acute 
infectious mononucleosis, discontinuation of Protopic should be considered. Patients who develop 
lymphadenopathy during treatment should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves. 
Patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections. Protopic ointment has not 
been evaluated for its efficacy and safety in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis. 
Before commencing treatment with Protopic ointment, clinical infections at treatment sites should be 
cleared. Treatment with Protopic is associated with an increased risk of folliculitis and herpes viral 
infections (herpes simplex dermatitis [eczema herpeticum], herpes simplex [cold sores], Kaposi’s 
varicelliform eruption) (see section 4.8). In the presence of these infections, the balance of risks and 
benefits associated with Protopic use should be evaluated. 
Emollients should not be applied to the same area within 2 hours of applying Protopic ointment. 
Concomitant use of other topical preparations has not been assessed. There is no experience with 
concomitant use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.  
Care should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. If accidentally applied to 
these areas, the ointment should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water.  
The use of Protopic ointment under occlusion has not been studied in patients. Occlusive dressings are 
not recommended.  
As with any topical medicinal product, patients should wash their hands after application if the hands 
are not intended for treatment.  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tacrolimus is extensively metabolised in the liver and although blood concentrations are low 
following topical therapy, the ointment should be used with caution in patients with hepatic failure 
(see section 5.2).  
Excipients warnings 
Protopic ointment contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321) as an excipient, which may cause local skin 
reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Formal topical drug interaction studies with tacrolimus ointment have not been conducted. 
Tacrolimus is not metabolised in human skin, indicating that there is no potential for percutaneous 
interactions that could affect the metabolism of tacrolimus. 
Systemically available tacrolimus is metabolised via the hepatic Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). 
Systemic exposure from topical application of tacrolimus ointment is low (< 1.0 ng/ml) and is unlikely 
to be affected by concomitant use of substances known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4. However, the 
possibility of interactions cannot be ruled out and the concomitant systemic administration of known 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and diltiazem) in patients with 
widespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution. 
Paediatric population 
An interaction study with protein-conjugated vaccine against Neisseria menigitidis serogroup C has 
been investigated in children aged 2-11 years. No effect on immediate response to vaccination, the 
generation of immune memory, or humoral and cell-mediated immunity has been observed (see 
section 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of tacrolimus ointment in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity following systemic administration (see section 5.3). The potential 
risk for humans is unknown. 
Protopic ointment should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
Human data demonstrate that, after systemic administration, tacrolimus is excreted into breast milk. 
Although clinical data have shown that systemic exposure from application of tacrolimus ointment is 
low, breast-feeding during treatment with Protopic ointment is not recommended. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Protopic ointment has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
In clinical studies approximately 50% of patients experienced some type of skin irritation adverse 
reaction at the site of application. Burning sensation and pruritus were very common, usually mild to 
moderate in severity and tended to resolve within one week of starting treatment. Erythema was a 
common skin irritation adverse reaction. Sensation of warmth, pain, paraesthesia and rash at the site of 
17 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
application were also commonly observed. Alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin irritation after 
consumption of an alcoholic beverage) was common. 
Patients may be at an increased risk of folliculitis, acne and herpes viral infections. 
Adverse reactions with suspected relationship to treatment are listed below by system organ class. 
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and uncommon 
(≥1/1,000 to <1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

severe atopic dermatitis the following adverse events were noted to occur more frequently than in the 
control group: application site impetigo (7.7% in children) and application site infections (6.4% in 
children and 6.3% in adults).

18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdosage following topical administration is unlikely.  
If ingested, general supportive measures may be appropriate. These may include monitoring of vital 
signs and observation of clinical status. Due to the nature of the ointment vehicle, induction of 
vomiting or gastric lavage is not recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents for dermatitis, excluding corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH01 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not fully understood. While the 
following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not 
known. 
Via its binding to a specific cytoplasmic immunophilin (FKBP12), tacrolimus inhibits calcium-
dependent signal transduction pathways in T cells, thereby preventing the transcription and synthesis 
of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and other cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-α and IFN-γ. 
In vitro, in Langerhans cells isolated from normal human skin, tacrolimus reduced the stimulatory 
activity towards T cells. Tacrolimus has also been shown to inhibit the release of inflammatory 
mediators from skin mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. 
In animals, tacrolimus ointment suppressed inflammatory reactions in experimental and spontaneous 
dermatitis models that resemble human atopic dermatitis. Tacrolimus ointment did not reduce skin 
thickness and did not cause skin atrophy in animals. 
In patients with atopic dermatitis, improvement of skin lesions during treatment with tacrolimus 
ointment was associated with reduced Fc receptor expression on Langerhans cells and a reduction of 
their hyperstimulatory activity towards T cells. Tacrolimus ointment does not affect collagen synthesis 
in humans.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of Protopic was assessed in more than 18,500 patients treated with tacrolimus 
ointment in Phase I to Phase III clinical trials. Data from six major trials are presented here. 
In a six-month multicentre double-blind randomised trial, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was administered 
twice-a-day to adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and compared to a topical 
corticosteroid based regimen (0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate on trunk and extremities, 1% 
hydrocortisone acetate on face and neck). The primary endpoint was the response rate at month 3 
defined as the proportion of patients with at least 60% improvement in the mEASI (modified Eczema 
Area and Severity Index) between baseline and month 3. The response rate in the 0.1% tacrolimus 
group (71.6%) was significantly higher than that in the topical corticosteroid based treatment group 
(50.8%; p<0.001; Table 1). The response rates at month 6 were comparable to the 3-month results.

The incidence and nature of most adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. Skin 
burning, herpes simplex, alcohol intolerance (facial flushing or skin sensitivity after alcohol intake), 
skin tingling, hyperaesthesia, acne and fungal dermatitis occurred more often in the tacrolimus 
treatment group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs in 
either treatment group throughout the study. 
In the second trial, children aged from 2 to 15 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received 
twice daily treatment for three weeks of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment or 1% 
hydrocortisone acetate ointment. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the 
mEASI as a percentage of baseline averaged over the treatment period. The results of this multicentre, 
double-blind, randomised trial showed that tacrolimus ointment, 0.03% and 0.1%, is significantly 
more effective (p<0.001 for both) than 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment (Table 2).

The incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the 
hydrocortisone group. Pruritus decreased over time in the tacrolimus groups but not in the 
hydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory values or vital signs 
in either treatment group throughout the clinical trial. 
The purpose of the third multicentre, double-blind, randomised study was the assessment of efficacy 
and safety of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice a day relative to twice daily 
administration of 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment in children with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis. Treatment duration was for up to three weeks.

The primary endpoint was defined as the percentage decrease in mEASI from the baseline to end of 
treatment. A statistically significant better improvement was shown for once daily and twice daily 
0.03% tacrolimus ointment compared to twice daily hydrocortisone acetate ointment (p<0.001 for 
both). Twice daily treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment was more effective than once daily 
administration (Table 3). The incidence of local skin burning was higher in the tacrolimus treatment 
groups than in the hydrocortisone group. There were no clinically relevant changes in the laboratory 
values or vital signs in either treatment group throughout the study. 
In the fourth trial, approximately 800 patients (aged ≥2 years) received 0.1% tacrolimus ointment 
intermittently or continuously in an open-label, long-term safety study for up to four years, with 300 
patients receiving treatment for at least three years and 79 patients receiving treatment for a minimum 
of 42 months. Based on changes from baseline in EASI score and body surface area affected, patients 
regardless of age had improvement in their atopic dermatitis at all subsequent time points. In addition, 
there was no evidence of loss of efficacy throughout the duration of the clinical trial. The overall 
incidence of adverse events tended to decrease as the study progressed for all patients independent of 
age. The three most common adverse events reported were flu-like symptoms (cold, common cold, 
influenza, upper respiratory infection, etc.), pruritus and skin burning. No adverse events previously 
unreported in shorter duration and/or previous studies were observed in this long-term study. 
The efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment in maintenance treatment of mild to severe atopic 
dermatitis was assessed in 524 patients in two Phase III multicentre clinical trials of similar design, 
one in adult patients (≥16 years) and one in paediatric patients (2-15 years). In both studies, patients 
with active disease entered an open-label period (OLP) during which they treated affected lesions with 
tacrolimus ointment twice daily until improvement had reached a predefined score (Investigator’s 
Global Assessment [IGA] ≤ 2, i.e. clear, almost clear or mild disease) for a maximum of 6 weeks. 
Thereafter, patients entered a double-blind disease control period (DCP) for up to 12 months. Patients 
were randomised to receive either tacrolimus ointment (0.1% adults; 0.03% children) or vehicle, once 
a day twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays. If a disease exacerbation occurred, patients were 
treated with open-label tacrolimus ointment twice daily for a maximum of 6 weeks until the IGA score 
returned to ≤2. 
The primary endpoint in both studies was the number of disease exacerbations requiring a “substantial 
therapeutic intervention” during the DCP, defined as an exacerbation with an IGA of 3-5 (i.e. 
moderate, severe and very severe disease) on the first day of the flare, and requiring more than 7 days 
treatment. Both studies showed significant benefit with twice weekly treatment with tacrolimus 
ointment with regard to the primary and key secondary endpoints over a period of 12 months in a 
pooled population of patients with mild to severe atopic dermatitis. In a subanalysis of a pooled 
population of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis these differences remained 
statistically significant (Table 4). No adverse events not reported previously were observed in these 
studies.

A seven-month, double blind, randomised parallel group study of paediatric patients (2-11 years) with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis was performed. In one arm patients received Protopic 0.03% 
ointment (n=121) twice a day for 3 weeks and thereafter once a day until clearance. In the comparator 
arm patients received 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment (HA) for head and neck and 0.1% 
hydrocortisone butyrate ointment for trunk and limbs (n=111) twice a day for 2 weeks and 
subsequently HA twice a day to all affected areas. During this period all patients and control subjects 
(n=44) received a primary immunisation and a rechallenge with a protein-conjugate vaccine against 
Neisseria menigitidis serogroup C. 
The primary endpoint of this study was the response rate to vaccination, defined as the percentage of 
patients with a serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titre ≥ 8 at the week 5 visit. Analysis of the 
response rate at week 5 showed equivalence between the treatment groups (hydrocortisone 98.3%, 
tacrolimus ointment 95.4%; 7-11 years: 100% in both arms). The results in the control group were 
similar. 
The primary response to vaccination was not affected. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Clinical data have shown that tacrolimus concentrations in systemic circulation after topical 
administration are low and, when measurable, transient. 
Absorption 
Data from healthy human subjects indicate that there is little or no systemic exposure to tacrolimus 
following single or repeated topical application of tacrolimus ointment. 
Target trough concentrations for systemic immunosuppression for oral tacrolimus are 5-20 ng/mL in 
transplant patients. Most atopic dermatitis patients (adults and children) treated with single or repeated 
application of tacrolimus ointment (0.03-0.1%), and infants from age of 5 months treated with 
tacrolimus ointment (0.03%) had blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/mL. When observed, blood 
concentrations exceeding 1.0 ng/mL were transient. Systemic exposure increases with increasing 
treatment areas. However, both the extent and the rate of topical absorption of tacrolimus decrease as 
the skin heals. In both adults and children with an average of 50% body surface area treated, systemic 
exposure (i.e. AUC) of tacrolimus from Protopic ointment is approximately 30-fold less than that seen 
with oral immunosuppressive doses in kidney and liver transplant patients. The lowest tacrolimus 
blood concentration at which systemic effects can be observed is not known.  
There was no evidence of systemic accumulation of tacrolimus in patients (adults and children) treated 
for prolonged periods (up to one year) with tacrolimus ointment.  
Distribution 
As systemic exposure is low with tacrolimus ointment, the high binding of tacrolimus (>98.8%) to 
plasma proteins is considered not to be clinically relevant. 
Following topical application of tacrolimus ointment, tacrolimus is selectively delivered to the skin 
with minimal diffusion into the systemic circulation. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism of tacrolimus by human skin was not detectable. Systemically available tacrolimus is 
extensively metabolised in the liver via CYP3A4. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
When administered intravenously, tacrolimus has been shown to have a low clearance rate. The 
average total body clearance is approximately 2.25 l/h. The hepatic clearance of systemically available 
tacrolimus could be reduced in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, or in subjects who are co-
treated with drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. 
Following repeated topical application of the ointment the average half-life of tacrolimus was 
estimated to be 75 hours for adults and 65 hours for children. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus after topical application are similar to those reported in adults, 
with minimal systemic exposure and no evidence of accumulation (see above). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance 
Repeated topical administration of tacrolimus ointment or the ointment vehicle to rats, rabbits and 
micropigs was associated with slight dermal changes such as erythema, oedema and papules.  
Long-term topical treatment of rats with tacrolimus led to systemic toxicity including alterations of 
kidneys, pancreas, eyes and nervous system. The changes were caused by high systemic exposure of 
rodents resulting from high transdermal absorption of tacrolimus. Slightly lower body weight gain in 
females was the only systemic change observed in micropigs at high ointment concentrations (3%). 
Rabbits were shown to be especially sensitive to intravenous administration of tacrolimus, reversible 
cardiotoxic effects being observed. 
Mutagenicity 
In vitro and in vivo tests did not indicate a genotoxic potential of tacrolimus. 
Carcinogenicity 
Systemic carcinogenicity studies in mice (18 months) and rats (24 months) revealed no carcinogenic 
potential of tacrolimus.  
In a 24-month dermal carcinogenicity study performed in mice with 0.1% ointment, no skin tumours 
were observed. In the same study an increased incidence of lymphoma was detected in association 
with high systemic exposure. 
In a photocarcinogenicity study, albino hairless mice were chronically treated with tacrolimus ointment 
and UV radiation. Animals treated with tacrolimus ointment showed a statistically significant reduction 
in time to skin tumour (squamous cell carcinoma) development and an increase in the number of tumours. 
This effect occurred at the higher concentrations of 0.3% and 1%. The relevance to humans is currently 
unknown. It is unclear whether the effect of tacrolimus is due to systemic immunosuppression or a local 
effect. The risk for humans cannot be completely ruled out as the potential for local immunosuppression 
with the long-term use of tacrolimus ointment is unknown. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Embryo/foetal toxicity was observed in rats and rabbits, but only at doses that caused significant 
toxicity in maternal animals. Reduced sperm function was noted in male rats at high subcutaneous 
doses of tacrolimus.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Protopic is and what it is used for 
The active substance of Protopic, tacrolimus monohydrate, is an immunomodulating agent.  
Protopic 0.03% ointment is used to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults who 
are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical 
corticosteroids and in children (2 years of age and older) who failed to respond adequately to 
conventional therapies such as topical corticosteroids.  
Once moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is cleared or almost cleared after up to 6 weeks treatment of 
a flare, and if you are experiencing frequent flares (i.e. 4 or more per year), it may be possible to 
prevent flares coming back or prolong the time you are free from flares by using Protopic 0.03% 
ointment twice weekly. 
In atopic dermatitis, an over-reaction of the skin’s immune system causes skin inflammation 
(itchiness, redness, dryness). Protopic alters the abnormal immune response and relieves the skin 
inflammation and the itch. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Protopic  
Do not use Protopic 
• 
If you are allergic to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) or to macrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Protopic: 
• 
• 
If you have liver failure. 
If you have any skin malignancies (tumours) or if you have a weakened immune system 
(immuno-compromised) whatever the cause. 
If you have an inherited skin barrier disease such as Netherton’s syndrome, lamellar 
ichthyosis (extensive scaling of the skin due to a thickening of the outer layer of the skin), or if 
• 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have an inflammatory skin disease such as pyoderma gangrenosum, or if you suffer from 
generalised erythroderma (inflammatory reddening and scaling of the entire skin). 
If you have a cutaneous Graft Versus Host Disease (an immune reaction of the skin which is a 
common complication in patients who have undergone a bone marrow transplant). 
If you have swollen lymph nodes at initiation of treatment. If your lymph nodes become 
swollen during treatment with Protopic, consult your doctor. 
If you have infected lesions. Do not apply the ointment to infected lesions. 
If you notice any change to the appearance of your skin, please inform your physician.  
Based on the results of long-term studies and experience, a link between Protopic ointment 
treatment and the development of malignancies has not been confirmed, but definitive 
conclusions cannot be drawn.   
Avoid exposing the skin to long periods of sunlight or artificial sunlight such as tanning beds. If 
you spend time outdoors after applying Protopic, use a sunscreen and wear loose fitting clothing 
that protects the skin from the sun. In addition, ask your doctor for advice on other appropriate 
sun protection methods. If you are prescribed light therapy, inform your doctor that you are 
using Protopic as it is not recommended to use Protopic and light therapy at the same time. 
If your doctor tells you to use Protopic twice weekly to keep your atopic dermatitis cleared, 
your condition should be reviewed by your doctor at least every 12 months, even if it remains 
under control. In children, maintenance treatment should be suspended after 12 months, to 
assess whether the need for continued treatment still exists. 
It is recommended to use Protopic ointment at the lowest possible strength, at the lowest 
frequency and for the shortest possible duration necessary. This decision should be based on 
your doctor’s assessment of how your eczema responds to Protopic ointment. 
Children 
• 
• 
Protopic ointment is not approved for children younger than 2 years of age. Therefore it 
should not be used in this age group. Please consult your doctor. 
The effect of treatment with Protopic on the developing immune system in children, especially 
the young, has not been established. 
Other medicines, cosmetics and Protopic 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
You may use moisturising creams and lotions during treatment with Protopic but these products 
should not be used within two hours of applying Protopic. 
The use of Protopic at the same time as other preparations to be used on the skin or while taking oral 
corticosteroids (e.g. cortisone) or medicines which affect the immune system has not been studied. 
Protopic with alcohol 
While using Protopic, drinking alcohol may cause the skin or face to become flushed or red and feel 
hot. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Protopic contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321) 
Protopic contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321), which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact 
dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. 
3. 
How to use Protopic  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Apply Protopic as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin. 
Protopic may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases 
of your elbows and knees. 
Avoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. If the ointment gets on any 
of these areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water. 
Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps. 
• 
•  Wash your hands after applying Protopic unless your hands are also being treated.

Children (2 years of age and older) 
Apply Protopic 0.03 % ointment twice a day for up to three weeks, once in the morning and once in 
the evening. Afterwards the ointment should be used once a day on each affected region of the skin 
until the eczema has gone away. 
Adults (16 years of age and older) 
Two strengths of Protopic (Protopic 0.03% and Protopic 0.1% ointment) are available for adult 
patients (16 years of age and older). Your doctor will decide which strength is best for you.

the evening, until the eczema has cleared. Depending on the response of your eczema your doctor will 
decide if the frequency of application can be reduced or the lower strength, Protopic 0.03% ointment, 
can be used. 
Treat each affected region of your skin until the eczema has gone away. Improvement is usually seen 
within one week. If you do not see any improvement after two weeks, see your doctor about other 
possible treatments.  
You may be told by your doctor to use Protopic ointment twice weekly once your atopic dermatitis has 
cleared or almost cleared (Protopic 0.03% for children and Protopic 0.1% for adults). Protopic 
ointment should be applied once a day twice weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas of your 
body commonly affected by atopic dermatitis. There should be 2–3 days without Protopic treatment 
between applications. 
If symptoms reappear you should use Protopic twice daily as outlined above and arrange to see your 
doctor to review your treatment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Protopic is and what it is used for 
The active substance of Protopic, tacrolimus monohydrate, is an immunomodulating agent.  
Protopic 0.1% ointment is used to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults who 
are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies such as topical 
corticosteroids. 
Once moderate to severe atopic dermatitis is cleared or almost cleared after up to 6 weeks treatment of 
a flare, and if you are experiencing frequent flares (i.e. 4 or more per year), it may be possible to 
prevent flares coming back or prolong the time you are free from flares by using Protopic 0.1% 
ointment twice weekly. 
In atopic dermatitis, an over-reaction of the skin’s immune system causes skin inflammation 
(itchiness, redness, dryness). Protopic alters the abnormal immune response and relieves the skin 
inflammation and the itch. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Protopic 
Do not use Protopic 
• 
If you are allergic to tacrolimus or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) or to macrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Protopic: 
• 
• 
• 
If you have liver failure. 
If you have any skin malignancies (tumours) or if you have a weakened immune system 
(immuno-compromised) whatever the cause. 
If you have an inherited skin barrier disease such as Netherton’s syndrome, lamellar 
ichthyosis (extensive scaling of the skin due to a thickening of the outer layer of the skin), or if 
you have an inflammatory skin disease such as pyoderma gangrenosum, or if you suffer from 
generalised erythroderma (inflammatory reddening and scaling of the entire skin).  
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you have a cutaneous Graft Versus Host Disease (an immune reaction of the skin which is a 
common complication in patients who have undergone a bone marrow transplant). 
If you have swollen lymph nodes at initiation of treatment. If your lymph nodes become 
swollen during treatment with Protopic, consult your doctor. 
If you have infected lesions. Do not apply the ointment to infected lesions. 
If you notice any change to the appearance of your skin, please inform your physician.  
Based on the results of long-term studies and experience, a link between Protopic ointment 
treatment and the development of malignancies has not been confirmed, but definitive 
conclusions cannot be drawn.   
Avoid exposing the skin to long periods of sunlight or artificial sunlight such as tanning beds. If 
you spend time outdoors after applying Protopic, use a sunscreen and wear loose fitting clothing 
that protects the skin from the sun. In addition, ask your doctor for advice on other appropriate 
sun protection methods. If you are prescribed light therapy, inform your doctor that you are 
using Protopic as it is not recommended to use Protopic and light therapy at the same time. 
If your doctor tells you to use Protopic twice weekly to keep your atopic dermatitis cleared, 
your condition should be reviewed by your doctor at least every 12 months, even if it remains 
under control. In children, maintenance treatment should be suspended after 12 months, to 
assess whether the need for continued treatment still exists. 
It is recommended to use Protopic ointment at the lowest possible strength, at the lowest 
frequency and for the shortest possible duration necessary. This decision should be based on 
your doctor’s assessment of how your eczema responds to Protopic ointment.  
Children 
• 
• 
Protopic 0.1 % ointment is not approved for children younger than 16 years of age. 
Therefore it should not be used in this age group. Please consult your doctor. 
The effect of treatment with Protopic on the developing immune system in children, especially 
the young, has not been established. 
Other medicines, cosmetics and Protopic 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
You may use moisturising creams and lotions during treatment with Protopic but these products 
should not be used within two hours of applying Protopic. 
The use of Protopic at the same time as other preparations to be used on the skin or while taking oral 
corticosteroids (e.g. cortisone) or medicines which affect the immune system has not been studied. 
Protopic with alcohol 
While using Protopic, drinking alcohol may cause the skin or face to become flushed or red and feel 
hot. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Protopic contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321) 
Protopic contains butylhydroxytoluene (E321), which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact 
dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes. 
3. 
How to use Protopic 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
• 
Apply Protopic as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Protopic may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases 
of your elbows and knees. 
Avoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. If the ointment gets on any 
of these areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water. 
Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps. 
• 
•  Wash your hands after applying Protopic unless your hands are also being treated. 
• 
Before applying Protopic after a bath or shower, be sure your skin is completely dry. 
Adults (16 years of age and older) 
Two strengths of Protopic (Protopic 0.03% and Protopic 0.1% ointment) are available for adult 
patients (16 years of age and older). Your doctor will decide which strength is best for you.  
Usually, treatment is started with Protopic 0.1% ointment twice a day, once in the morning and once in 
the evening, until the eczema has cleared. Depending on the response of your eczema your doctor will 
decide if the frequency of application can be reduced or the lower strength, Protopic 0.03% ointment, 
can be used. 
Treat each affected region of your skin until the eczema has gone away. Improvement is usually seen 
within one week. If you do not see any improvement after two weeks, see your doctor about other 
possible treatments.  
You may be told by your doctor to use Protopic 0.1% ointment twice weekly once your atopic 
dermatitis has cleared or almost cleared. Protopic 0.1 % ointment should be applied once a day twice 
weekly (e.g. Monday and Thursday) to areas of your body commonly affected by atopic dermatitis. 
There should be 2–3 days without Protopic treatment between applications. 
If symptoms reappear you should use Protopic twice daily as outlined above and arrange to see your 
doctor to review your treatment. 
If you accidentally swallow some ointment 
If you accidentally swallow the ointment, consult your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Do 
not try to induce vomiting. 
If you forget to use Protopic 
If you forget to apply the ointment at the scheduled time, do it as soon as you remember and then 
continue as before.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS 
OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tacrolimus (topical 
formulations), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on the risk of significant systemic absorption when used off-label to treat 
pyoderma gangrenosum from cases in the literature, the PRAC concluded that the product information 
of products containing topical tacrolimus should be amended to add pyoderma gangrenosum to the list 
of conditions mentioned in the SmPC for which tacrolimus ointment is not recommended. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions 
and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tacrolimus (topical formulations) the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tacrolimus (topical 
formulations) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

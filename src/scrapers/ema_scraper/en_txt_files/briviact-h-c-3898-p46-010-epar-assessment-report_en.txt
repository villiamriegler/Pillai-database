1.  Introduction 
On July 4th 2022, the  MAH submitted  a completed paediatric study for brivarecetam, in accordance 
with  Article 46  of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter,  Long-Term Study to  Evaluate Safety and 
Efficacy of Brivaracetam Used as Adjunctive Treatment in Pediatric Subjects with  Epilepsy (N01266)  is 
part of a clinical development program.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Brivaracetam (tablet and oral solution) was administered bid approximately 12 hours apart in 2 equally 
divided doses. Study participants were dosed with either oral tablets or oral solution and not a 
combination of both. The mg dosage for the  oral tablet treatment  was calculated to match as closely as 
possible the  mg/kg-based dosage and was a combination of the BRV 10mg,  25mg, and 50mg tablets. 
Only the following exact dosages were allowed for the oral tablet administration: BRV 20, 40, 50,  70, 
100,  150, and 200mg/day. 
The dose of oral solution  was measured using the  appropriate syringes (1mL, 3mL,  and/or 10mL)  with 
an adaptor able to fit  both bottle sizes. Oral solution  should not have been mixed with  other liquids 
prior to  administration. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted  a final report(s) for: 
• 
N01266  - Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter,  Long-Term Study to Evaluate Safety and 
Efficacy of Brivaracetam Used as Adjunctive Treatment in Pediatric Subjects with  Epilepsy 
N01266 - Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter, Long-Term Study to 
Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Brivaracetam Used as Adjunctive Treatment 
in Pediatric Subjects with Epilepsy 
Description 
N01266  was a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, LTFU  study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of BRV in study participants with  epilepsy.  
Upon enrollment, eligible LTFU  study participants entered the Evaluation Period and continued  their 
BRV treatment in  accordance with their individualized dose at the completion of the core study. 
Directly enrolled (DE) study  participants were screened and participated in up to 3 weeks of an Up 
Titration Period. If a DE study participant demonstrated, in the opinion of the Investigator, acceptable

tolerability and seizure control on the same daily dose of BRV (no lower than the minimum specified 
dose) for 7±2 days during the Up-Titration  Period, the study participant  attended the Entry Visit (EV) 
and entered the Evaluation Period on that  dose. 
For LTFU  study participants, the EV was the first study visit. For  DE study participants,  the EV was the 
visit at which  study participants entered the Evaluation Period and occurred after study participants 
completed the Screening Visit (ScrV) and at least 1 Titration Visit  (TV). For study  participants who 
continued in the  study until it  ended, the Evaluation Period extended from the EV to the Final Visit 
(FV). For study  participants who prematurely discontinued the study, the Evaluation Period lasted from 
the EV until  the Early Discontinuation  Visit (EDV). Following the EDV or following  the FV for study 
participants who completed the study but  did not continue BRV treatment,  study participants had their 
BRV dose reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week for a maximum of 4 weeks until  a dose 
of 1mg/kg/day (50mg/day for study  participants with  body weights >50kg)  was reached (Down-
Titration Period). After 2 weeks free of IMP (Safety Period), study participants completed the Safety 
Visit (SV). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Overall, it was planned that  approximately 600 study participants would be enrolled in N01266  from a 
core study; however, study participants  from study N01269  were not rolled over to  N01266,  and 
studies N01265  and N01268  were not  conducted. Therefore, the anticipated number of LTFU  study 
participants for N01266  was approximately 270.  
Study participants who enrolled in  N01266  from a core study (ie, LTFU  study participants from other 
BRV studies N01263,  EP0065,  or N01349)  must have been ≥1 month to <16  years of age upon entry in 
the core study; eligible study participants who  had POS and enrolled in N01266  without  having 
participated in a core study (ie, directly enrolled [DE] study participants) must have been ≥4 years to 
<17 years of age. 
Below are some key Inclusion criteria for DE study  participants only: 
8. Study participant was a male or female ≥4 years to <17 years of age. 
9. Study participant had a clinical diagnosis of POS according to the International League Against 
Epilepsy (ILAE) classification. 
10. Study participant  had an EEG compatible with  the clinical diagnosis of POS. 
11. Study participant  had been observed to have uncontrolled POS after an adequate course of 
treatment (in  the opinion of the Investigator) with  at least 1 AED (concurrently or sequentially). 
12. Study participant  had at  least 1 seizure (POS) during the 3 weeks before the ScrV. 
13. Study participant  was taking at least 1 AED. All AEDs needed to be at a stable dose for at least 7 
days before the ScrV. Vagal nerve stimulator stable for at least 2 weeks before the  ScrV was allowed 
and was counted as a concomitant AED. Benzodiazepines taken more than once a week (for any 
indication) were considered as a concomitant AED. 
CHMP  comments 
In general, the study population  included in  this study was similar to  the one defined in the authorized 
indication with  the exception of some patients from LTFU part (from EP0065 and N01349),  which were 
younger.

Treatments 
Immediate-release BRV oral solution and immediate-release, film-coated BRV oral tablets were 
provided during the study. 
Brivaracetam oral solution, at a concentration of 10mg/mL, was supplied in 300mL  glass bottles. 
Brivaracetam oral tablets were provided in the  following strengths: 10mg,  25mg, and 50mg. 
There was no placebo or reference product. 
Brivaracetam (tablet and oral solution) was administered bid approximately 12 hours apart in 2 equally 
divided doses. Study participants were dosed with either oral tablets or oral solution and not a 
combination of both. The mg dosage for the  oral tablet treatment  was calculated to match as closely as 
possible the  mg/kg-based dosage and was a combination of the BRV 10mg,  25mg, and 50mg tablets. 
Only the following exact dosages were allowed for the oral tablet administration: BRV 20, 40, 50,  70, 
100,  150, and 200mg/day. 
For all study participants enrolled in  N01266,  the maximum BRV dose was 5.0mg/kg/day (2.5mg/kg 
bid), not  to exceed a dose of 200mg/day. Dose adjustments of BRV and/or concomitant antiepileptic 
drugs [AEDs] were allowed at any time based on clinical judgment; however, during  the Up Titration 
Period, dose adjustments for BRV should have been made only as specified in the protocol. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of N01266  was to  document the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV.  
The secondary objective of N01266  was to assess the efficacy of BRV during long term exposure. 
The following other objectives were studied in N01266: 
•

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Overall, 264 study participants  enrolled in the study and 257  study participants (97.3%)  were included 
in the SS, including 127  study participants in the DE cohort and 137 study participants in the  LTFU 
cohort. Seven DE study  participants (5.5%) were screen failures. 
The number of study participants varied across age groups: 36  study participants in the ≥1 month to 
<2 years age group, 15  study participants in the ≥2 to <4 years age group, 141  study participants in 
the ≥4 to <12  years age group, and 65  study participants in the ≥12 to <17  years age group. Due to 
the low number of participants in the ≥1 month to  <2 years and ≥2 to <4  years age groups, any 
comparison of data across age groups should be made with caution  (Table 5 1). 
A total of 124 study participants (48.2%)  completed the study (Table 5 1), 65 participants (47.4%)  in 
the LTFU  cohort and 59 participants (49.2%)  in the DE cohort (N01266  CSR Table 1.2.2).  Eighteen 
participants (50.0%)  in the ≥1 month to  <2 years age group, 4 participants (26.7%)  in the ≥2 to <4 
years age group, 65 participants (46.1%)  in the  ≥4 to  <12 years age group, and 37 participants 
(56.9%)  in the ≥12 to <17  years age group completed the study (Table 5 1).

Based on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) information collected at the time of entry into the 
core studies for LTFU  participants or at the  time of entry into  N01266  for DE participants, the majority 
of study participants overall had POS (185 study participants  [72.0%])  and 68  study participants 
(26.5%)  had generalized seizures at the ScrV or 3  weeks prior to the  ScrV.

The most frequently reported seizures at Baseline were classified as complex partial (144 study 
participants [56.0%]),  followed by partial evolving to  secondary generalized (112 study participants 
[43.6%]).  A total of 66 study participants (25.7%)  had generalized seizures; the most frequently 
reported seizures at Baseline were myoclonic (30 study participants  [11.7%]),  followed by tonic (23 
study participants [8.9%]).  A total of 12 study participants (4.7%)  had a seizure profile classified as 
unclassifiable (Table 5 5). 
A greater proportion of study participants in  the ≥2 to <4 years (66.7%),  ≥4 to  <12 years (85.8%), 
and ≥12 to <17 years (86.2%)  of age groups had a POS profile at Baseline compared with  study 
participants in the  ≥1 month  to <2 years of age group (58.3%);  this would be expected given the 
study was designed to enroll more study participants with  POS in the ≥4 years age groups (DE study 
participants must have been ≥4 years to <17 years of age [Section 1.3.3]).  A greater proportion of 
study participants in the  ≥1 month  to <2 years (36.1%)  and ≥2 to  <4 years (60.0%) age groups had a

A greater proportion of POS study participants had localization-related epileptic syndromes 
(163/185  study participants [88.1%])  at Baseline compared with  PGS study participants and study 
participants with  primary generalized seizure excluding typical absence (PGS*; 10/68  study 
participants [14.7%]  and 10/66  study participants [15.2%],  respectively). Whereas a greater 
proportion of PGS and PGS* study participants had generalized epileptic syndromes (54/68 study 
participants [79.4%]  and 52/66  study participants [78.8%],  respectively) at Baseline compared with 
POS study participants (9/185  study participants [4.9%]). 
CHMP  comments 
The largest group of patients included into  the study was 4-12 years old. The majority of patients were 
coming from Europe with  the largest group coming from East  Europe (38%).   
Most  common were complex partial seizures (56%)  and the most common type of PGS seizures were 
myoclonic seizures (30%).

A summary of prior AEDs used by at  least 10%  of all study participants  is presented in Table 7-8. 
Table 7-8:  Summary of prior AEDs used by ≥ 10% of all study participants (SS) 
Overall, 252 study participants  (98.1%) reported taking at least 1 AED medication at entry into the 
core study for LTFU  study participants and at entry into  N01266  for DE study participants.  The majority 
of study participants reported taking 3 or fewer AEDs at study entry: 68  participants (26.5%)  reported 
taking 1 AED, 107 participants (41.6%)  reported taking 2 AEDs, and 58 participants (22.6%)  reported 
taking 3 AEDs at  study entry. The most commonly reported AEDs taken at  study entry were valproate 
(117  study participants [45.5%]),  topiramate (55  study participants [21.4%]),  and clobazam (48 
study participants [18.7%]). 
The concomitant AEDs used by ≥10% of all study participants are summarized in Table 7‒10.

Table 7‒10:  Summary of concomitant AEDs used by ≥ 10% of all study participants (SS) 
CHMP  comments 
It is noted that  rather large proportion of patients had prior use of levetiracetam reported (44%)  as 
well as valproate (38%).  
The most common concomitant ASD was valproate (50%),  especially in the youngest patients (≥1 
month to  < 2 years) - increase from 16.7%  to 50%. It  is also noted that  percentage of patients  using 
at least 1 ASD as a concomitant  treatment was similar (99.2%)  to the proportion of patients using at 
least one ASD at  the study entry (98.1%)  which  was higher compared to prior use of ASD (78.6%). 
Having in mind that  study entry for LTFU  study participants was defined as the time  of entry into the 
previous core study and for direct enrolled (DE) study participants it was time of entry into N01266, 
the increased use of concomitant  ASD medications complicates interpretation of efficacy results. 
Number analysed 
Overall, 257 study participants  (97.3%) of the 264  study participants enrolled received at least 1 dose 
of BRV and were included in the SS; 7 DE study participants (5.5%)  were screen failures. In addition, 
257 study participants  (97.3%) had a Baseline and at least 1 completed post-Baseline DRC or EEG and 
were included in the  FAS.

Overall, study participants ≥2 years of age with  POS reported a median (minimum,  maximum) absolute 
change in POS frequency from Baseline over the Evaluation Period of 7.09  (7075.3,  721.9)  per 28 day 
period and a median (minimum, maximum) percent change in POS frequency of 62.92% (-693.7%, 
100.0%)  per 28-day period. The large median absolute and percent change values during Months  1 to 
3 are due, in part, to  a small number of study participants  such as Study Participant who had seizure 
frequencies of 1020.0 at  Baseline, 356.0 at Up-Titration,  and 8095.3  over the Evaluation Period, 
resulting in the  absolute and percent changes from Baseline of  7075.3  and  693.7%,  respectively. The 
study participant received BRV treatment for 106 days before discontinuing  the study due to lack of 
efficacy.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 7.7.1 
Overall, 81 study participants (50.9%  of all evaluable participants ≥2 years of age) were responders 
during the Evaluation Period (defined as participants with  a ≥50% reduction in the  number of seizure 
days, standardized to a 28 day duration,  based on the DRC data). This included 61 study  participants 
with  POS (48.4%  of evaluable participants ≥2 years of age with  POS) and 20 study participants  with 
primary generalized seizures (PGS) (60.6%  of evaluable participants ≥2 years of age with  PGS). 
CHMP  comments 
In patients ≥2 years of age the absolute numbers and percentage of POS were reduced compared to 
baseline. In patients  with PGS there were more responders (60.6%) compared to patients  with  POS 
(48.4%).

Evaluation Period of 0.00 ( 1.0,  0.0), each (Table 4-16)  (negative data for worsening indicate a 
reduction of PGS seizure frequency in these analyses). Only 1 participant  <2 years of age with  POS 
had data to calculate percent worsening in PGS ADF during the Evaluation Period. 
CHMP  comments 
Numbers of study participants <2 years of age were very low thus  interpretation of the observed 
efficacy endpoints is difficult. 
Other  efficacy variable  – Study participants with typical absence  seizures 
There were 2 study participants with  typical absence seizures; neither of these study participants 
reported non-absence seizures during the  course of the study. 
Other  efficacy variable  – Direct cost parameters 
For study participants overall who remained in the  study and on BRV treatment, higher proportions of 
study participants achieved fewer health  care provider visits and hospital stays over time, with  similar 
observations across age groups.

Safety  results 
Treatment  exposure 
A total of 264 study participants had been enrolled and 257 received BRV treatment in N01266  with a 
mean of 3.2  study-participants years of exposure. Of these, 184 study participants (71.6%)  had been 
exposed to BRV for at least 12 months, 151  study participants (58.8%)  had been exposed to BRV for 
at least 24 months,  113 study participants (44.0%)  had been exposed to BRV for at least 36 months, 
88 study participants (34.2%)  had been exposed to BRV for at least 48 months,  and 74 study 
participants (28.8%)  had been exposed to BRV for at least 60 months.

CHMP  comments 
The 257 patients received BRV treatment in  N01266  with  a mean of 3.2  study-participants years of 
exposure. However, only 6 out of 15 patients  in ≥2 to  <4 years age group were exposed for more than 
18 months.  Thus, even after the  completion of the study the  information regarding long-term exposure 
in this  age group is very limited.

14.8%),  and severe TEAEs (range: 14.8%  to 18.6%)  were similar across geographic regions. The 
incidence of SAEs was higher in Western Europe (46.5%) compared with  the other geographic regions 
(range: 27.9% to 32.7%)  and the incidence of IMP related TEAEs was lower in Latin  America (19.7%) 
compared with  the other geographic regions (range: 32.7% to  37.2%).

A total of 240 study participants (93.4%)  experienced TEAEs, most frequently reported in the  system 
organ class (SOC) of Infections and infestations (187 study participants  [72.8%]),  followed by Nervous 
system disorders (135  study participants [52.5%]),  and Gastrointestinal disorders (117 study

participants [45.5%]).  Overall, the most frequently reported TEAEs (by preferred term [PT]) were 
nasopharyngitis (75  study participants [29.2%]),  pyrexia (65 study participants [25.3%]),  and 
pharyngitis (59 study participants [23.0%])  (Table 5 9). 
In considering most common ongoing TEAEs by 3-month  time interval, a higher proportion of study 
participants experiencing TEAEs was observed during the first 3 months  of treatment  (195 study 
participants [75.9%])  compared with  the subsequent time intervals, with an overall trend of similar 
TEAEs over time. 
In considering most common TEAEs by total  duration of exposure cohorts, across total duration of 
exposure cohorts, the  most frequent TEAEs experienced were consistently nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, 
vomiting, pharyngitis, seizure, and diarrhea. Study participants who remained on BRV for periods 
longer than 30 months experienced increased incidence of PTs in the  SOC of Infections and infestations 
(eg, upper respiratory tract infection,  gastroenteritis, cough, and rhinitis). 
Most common TEAEs by study period 
A total of 120 DE study participants entered the Up-Titration  Period and 59 DE study participants 
(49.2%)  experienced TEAEs, most frequently in  the SOCs of Infections and infestations (22  study 
participants [18.3%])  and Psychiatric disorders (20 study  participants [16.7%]).  Overall, the incidence 
of TEAEs (by PT) was low (<6%) with  irritability (7  study participants [5.8%])  and decreased appetite, 
diarrhea, and cough (6 study participants [5.0%]  each) being most frequently reported. 
One DE study participant  (1/120 study  participants [0.8%]) experienced a TEAE of suicidal ideation 
during the Up  Titration Period. Nine study  participants (9/255 study participants  [3.5%]) experienced 
TEAEs of suicidal ideation during the  Evaluation Period (DE n=7,  LTFU  n=2). One study participant 
(DE) (1/124  study participants [0.8%])  experienced a TEAE of suicidal ideation during the Safety 
Period. 
A total of 255 study participants entered the Evaluation Period and a majority experienced TEAEs 
during this  period (233 study  participants [91.4% of all study participants]).  The most frequently 
reported TEAEs overall were nasopharyngitis (73 study participants [28.6%])  and pyrexia (61 study 
participants [23.9%]). 
Eighty-six study participants entered the Down-Titration Period, and 9 study  participants (10.5%) 
experienced TEAEs. Varicella, nasopharyngitis, and status  epilepticus were reported by 2 study 
participants (2.3%)  each; the  remaining PTs were reported by 1 participant each. 
One hundred twenty-four  study participants were evaluated during the Safety Period and 22 study 
participants (17.7%)  experienced TEAEs. Pharyngitis was reported by 3 study  participants (2.4%) and 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and seizure were reported by 2  participants (1.6%) each; the remaining PTs 
were reported by 1 participant  each. 
Treatment-emergent  AEs by maximum intensity 
Overall, a majority of study participants experienced TEAEs with  a maximum intensity of mild (60 
study participants [23.3%])  or moderate (136 study participants  [52.9%]).  A total  of 44  study 
participants (17.1%)  experienced severe TEAEs. The most frequently reported severe TEAEs were 
seizure (7 study participants  [2.7%]), pneumonia (7 study participants [2.7%]),  and status  epilepticus 
(5 study participants [1.9%]);  no other severe TEAEs were experienced by more than 2 study 
participants.

CHMP  comments 
The most common TEAEs are similar to the ones described in the SmPC. No new unexpected TEAEs 
were reported. 
Adverse events  of special interest 
There were no study  participants who reported TEAEs of special interest. Three study participants 
reported 4 TEAEs that  were erroneously marked as TEAEs of special interest. These TEAEs did not 
meet the predefined criteria described in  the protocol for being of special interest; however, cases 
were not  resolved by data cleaning before lock of the data base. Therefore, these cases are reported: 
• 
• 
1 event of seizure (nonserious, mild, did not  lead to discontinuation) 
2 events of simple partial seizures in 1 participant (1  event was nonserious and moderate, 1 
event was serious and moderate, and both  led to discontinuation) 
• 
1 event of epididymitis (serious, moderate, did not lead to discontinuation) 
Deaths 
Seven study participants died during the study. A by participant  listing of AEs with  an outcome of 
death is provided in N01266  CSR Listing 9.2.4  and is presented in Table 5-11.

CHMP  comments 
Seven patients died during the study according to the Table 5-11  “AEs with  an outcome of death (SS)”. 
Patients’ age ranged from 0.58  to 14 years old. Two patients were directly enrolled (DE) into the 
study, while remaining were from the LTFU.  The relationship to  the IMP was considered as not related 
by the MAH.   
It is noted that  another fatal outcome was presented in the  Table 5-13 “AEs leading to discontinuation 
(SS)”. Patient (LTFU/F/)  died from pneumonia on day 81 from the treatment onset. Addition of this 
patient to  the list would  make the most common cause of death pneumonia (n=4).  The second most 
common cause of death was circulatory collapse (n=2). Other death causes were reported in single 
individual patients.

Data source: N01266 CSR Table 12.4.1.1 
Overall, a total of 83 study participants (32.3%)  experienced serious TEAEs, most frequently in the 
SOC of Nervous system disorders (41 study participants [16.0%])  (N01266  CSR Table 12.4.1.1). 
Seizure was the most frequently reported serious TEAE by PT. 
There were a total  of 5 SAEs considered to be IMP related: weight  decreased, epilepsy, seizure, status 
epilepticus, and homicidal ideation (each experienced by 1 study participant [0.4%]). 
CHMP  comments 
Seizures (6.2%)  and status  epilepticus (4.3%) were the most common serious TEAEs. The highest 
proportion of patients  with  “status epilepticus” were reported in patients ≥1 month  to <2 years old 
(5.6%)  and ≥4 to <12  years old (5%).  
“Convulsion” is listed as a common ADR in the SmPC. Status  epilepticus is not listed in the SmPC.

Discontinuation due to adverse  events 
Thirty-one study participants (12.1%)  had TEAEs that  led to permanent discontinuation  of IMP (Table 5 
8). The most frequently reported TEAEs overall that  led to discontinuation  of IMP were suicidal ideation 
(4 study participants)  and pneumonia, simple partial seizures, status epilepticus, pregnancy, and 
circulatory collapse (2  study participants each). Ten of the 31 study participants  discontinued due to 
IMP-related TEAEs.

CHMP  comments 
It is noted that  according the Table 5-13 “AEs leading to discontinuation  (SS)” 33  patients discontinued 
treatment because of AEs, including 8 fatal cases. Majority of patients were from the LTFU  (n=20)  and 
13 patients  were DE. Majority of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation  resolved or were resolving 
(n=22).  The AEs which  were not resolved after discontinuation  of treatment included pregnancy (n=2), 
suicidal ideation (n=2),  depression/major depression (n=2), simple partial seizures (n=2), 
neurocystirecosis and hepatic enzyme increase.  
Hematology 
Mean values for the majority of hematology parameters remained within  the normal ranges overall and 
for each age group. Observed changes from Baseline to the Last Value were small and generally similar 
between age groups. 
Overall, the incidences of possibly clinically significant  treatment-emergent (PCST) hematology values 
in the Evaluation Period were generally low (≤10% for any parameter), with  the exception of low 
neutrophils (46 study  participants [18.5%]). 
Reported TEAEs associated with  hematology values were in the SOCs of Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders or Investigations and included anemia (5 study  participants [1.9%]),  hypochromic anemia, 
neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased (2 study participants 
[0.8%]  each), and eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, iron deficiency 
anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophil count  increased, and 
hemoglobin decreased (1 study participant  [0.4%] each). 
Blood chemistry 
Mean values for the majority of biochemistry parameters remained within  the normal ranges overall 
and for each age group. Observed changes from Baseline to  the Last Value were small and generally 
similar between age groups. Overall, no consistent  or clinically relevant treatment related changes in 
mean or median chemistry values were observed. With the exception of GGT, the incidences of PCST 
values for liver function parameters were low. Reported PCST blood chemistry values for liver function 
included high ALT (9 study participants [3.6%]),  high  AST (4 study participants [1.6%]),  high  ALP (4 
study participants [1.6%]),  and high bilirubin  (1 study participant [0.4%]). 
Endocrinology 
Mean values for the endocrinology parameters remained within  the normal ranges for the duration of 
the study overall and for each age group. Mean and/or median endocrinology values occasionally were 
outside the normal range overall and for individual age groups at visits where the number of study 
participants for that visit was small or where values for the given parameter were already outside the 
normal range at Baseline. These changes were not deemed to  be clinically significant. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis parameters were generally within normal ranges and there were no mean changes from 
Baseline to the Last  Value during the Evaluation Period and during the  Up Titration Period for DE study 
participants that  were considered clinically relevant. 
Vital  signs 
Mean values for the vital signs parameters remained within  the normal ranges overall and for each age 
group. Observed changes from Baseline to the  Last Value were small and generally similar between

age groups. Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant treatment related changes in mean or median 
vital signs values were observed. 
ECG findings 
At Baseline, the majority of study participants  (194 study participants out  of 254  [76.4%])  had normal 
ECG findings; 58 study participants out  of 254  (22.8%)  had abnormal but not  clinically significant  ECG 
findings; and 2 study participants (0.8%)  had clinically significant findings. The percentage of study 
participants with  normal and abnormal but not clinically significant ECG findings remained generally 
consistent over time through  the SV. 
Pregnancies 
There were 2 pregnancies reported by UCB’s Patient Safety database (N01266  CSR Listing  9.2.2): 
• 
Study participant LTFU  study participant at  study entry. Investigational medicinal product was 
discontinued. 
• 
Study participant LTFU  study participant at  study entry. Investigational medicinal product was 
discontinued. 
Tanner stage 
Apart from slight  inconsistencies regarding the  staging of the development process in some study 
participants between individual visits, the individual data are as expected. There is no obvious effect of 
the drug on the sexual maturation  process. 
Behavior  and cognition 
Achenbach CBCL 
Mean and median changes from Baseline in CBCL raw scores for both  the study participants aged 1½ 
to 5 years and for ages 6 to 18 years were small in amplitude and generally negative (reflecting slight 
improvement) or close to 0.  In both  age groups, the vast majority of study participants had no shift in 
T score category from Baseline to  last evaluation for each Achenbach CBCL subscale (between normal 
and borderline or clinical range [BCR]).  
The proportions of study participants aged 1½ to 5 who were normal at Baseline and remained in the 
normal range at the 6-month  assessment were 82.1%  for aggressive behavior, 79.5% for 
anxious/depressed, 51.3% for attention  problems, 69.2% for emotionally reactive, 82.1%  for sleep 
problems, 59.0%  for somatic complaints, and 46.2%  for withdrawn.  The proportions of study 
participants aged 6 to 18 years who were normal at Baseline and remained in the normal range at the 
6-month  assessment were 55.2%  for aggressive behavior, 62.1% for anxious/depressed, 44.0% for 
attention  problems, 69.8%  for rule-breaking behavior, 42.2%  for social problems, 57.8%  for somatic 
complaints, 59.5%  for thought  problems, and 60.3%  for withdrawn/depressed. 
BRIEF-P/BRIEF 
The BRIEF-P was used for study participants  ≥2 years to <5  years of age and the  BRIEF was used for 
study participants ≥5 years of age. 
Mean and median changes from Baseline in BRIEF-P and BRIEF raw scores were small in  amplitude and 
generally negative (reflecting slight  improvement) or close to 0. In both age groups, the vast majority 
of study participants had no shift in T score category from Baseline to last evaluation for BRIEF-
P/BRIEF subscales (between normal and potentially clinically significant [PCS]). Changes that  occurred 
across the BRIEF-P subscales were mostly from PCS to normal. Across the BRIEF subscales, similar 
proportions of study participants  changed from normal to PCS or from PCS to normal.

The proportions of study participants aged ≥2 years to <5  years of age (BRIEF-P) who  were normal at 
Baseline and remained in the normal range at the 6-month  assessment were 80.0% for inhibitory self-
control, 77.8%  for flexibility, 30.0%  for emergent metacognition, and 70.0% for global executive 
composite (GEC). The proportions of study  participants aged ≥5 years of age (BRIEF) who were normal 
at Baseline and remained in the normal range at the  6-month assessment were 48.5% for behavioral 
regulation, 49.5%  for metacognition, and 43.7%  for GEC. 
Bayley-III  scores 
Only 1 study participant met the criteria of the Bayley-III assessment. 
PedsQL 
Mean and median changes from Baseline in parent-reported PedsQL scores were generally positive 
(reflecting improvement) or close to 0 when negative, with  the exception of values at Early 
Discontinuation, where the mean changes were negative (ranging from -5.1  for school functioning to  -
2.3 for emotional functioning). 
Similarly, for self-reported PedsQL, the mean and median changes from Baseline were generally 
positive or close to  0 when negative, with  the exception of values at Early Discontinuation,  where the 
mean changes for all but  1 score were negative (ranging from -8.2  for physical functioning to 0.2  for 
social functioning). 
Calculated values and change from Baseline in PedsQL scores, by age, parent reported and self 
reported are provided for the SS in N01266  CSR Table 7.16.2.1  and N01266  CSR Table 7.16.2.2, 
respectively. No particular trends in  calculated values and change from Baseline in PedsQL scores, by 
age, parent reported and self-reported were observed. 
CHMP  comments 
No clear changes were observed for sexual maturation,  cognitive and behavioral functioning  as 
measured by Tanner scale, Achenbach CBCL, BRIEF-P/BRIEF and PedsQL. 
Assessment of suicidality 
Positive findings  on the  Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for questions regarding 
suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior were reported for 13 study participants and 11 study 
participants, respectively. Of the study participants who had positive responses on the C SSRS, 11 
study participants experienced TEAEs of suicidal ideation, 1 study participant experienced a TEAE of 
suicide attempt, 4  study participants experienced depression, 1 study participant  experienced 
depressed mood, and 3 study participants experienced self-injurious behavior. 
No suicide attempts were reported on the C-SSRS during the study. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
N01266  was a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Long-Term Follow-Up  (LTFU)  study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of BRV in study participants  with epilepsy.  
The eligible LTFU  study participants were enrollment from studies N01263,  EP0065,  or N01349 
(n=137).  In addition, a number of eligible patients were directly enrolled (DE) into the study (n=127).  
The study objectives primarily focused on long-term safety of treatment.  The efficacy variables were 
described as secondary. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/798155/2022  
Page 46/48 
 
 
 
A total of 264 study participants had been enrolled and 257 received BRV treatment in N01266  with a 
mean of 3.2  study-participants years of exposure. The largest group of patients included into  the study 
was 4-12 years old (n=141).  Only 6 out of 15 patients in ≥2 to <4 years age group were exposed for 
more than  18 months. Thus, even after the completion of the study the information regarding long-
term exposure in this age group is very limited. At baseline, patients had the most common type of 
POS - complex partial seizures (56%)  and the most common type of PGS seizures were myoclonic 
seizures (30%). 
Due to  study design the  interpretation of the observed efficacy results is highly uncertain. In patients 
≥2 years of age the absolute numbers and percentage of POS were reduced compared to baseline. 
Other efficacy variables for all study participants ≥2 years of age – absolute and percent change in  28-
days adjusted total seizure frequency from Baseline to the end of the Evaluation Period, seizure 
freedom, proportion of seizure free days during the evaluation period, - are pointing  to the  same 
direction as secondary efficacy variables. 
Numbers of study participants <2 years of age were very low thus  interpretation of the observed 
efficacy endpoints is difficult. 
The most common TEAEs are similar to the ones known for BRV which  are described in the SmPC. No 
new unexpected TEAEs were reported. Seizures (6.2%) and status epilepticus (4.3%)  were the  most 
common serious TEAEs. The highest proportion of patients with  “status  epilepticus” were reported in 
patients ≥1  month to <2  years old (5.6%)  and ≥4 to <12  years old (5%).   
There were some discrepancies observed in reported deaths. Seven patients  died during the  study 
according to  the Table 5-11  “AEs with  an outcome of death (SS)”. Patients’ age ranged from 0.58 to 14 
years old. Two patients were directly enrolled (DE) into  the study, while remaining were from the 
LTFU.  The relationship to  the IMP was considered as not related by the MAH. It  is noted  that another 
fatal outcome was presented in the Table 5-13  “AEs leading to discontinuation (SS)”. Patient 
(LTFU/F/8)  died from pneumonia on day 81 from the treatment onset. Addition of this  patient to the 
list would  make the most common cause of death pneumonia (n=4).  The second most common cause 
of death was circulatory collapse (n=2).  Other death causes were reported in single individual patients.  
It is also noted that in the  Table 5-13  “AEs leading to discontinuation  (SS)” 33 patients discontinued 
treatment because of AEs, including 8 fatal cases. Majority of patients were from the LTFU  (n=20)  and 
13 patients  were DE. Majority of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation  resolved or were resolving 
(n=22).  The AEs which  were not resolved after discontinuation  of treatment included pregnancy (n=2), 
suicidal ideation (n=2),  depression/major depression (n=2), simple partial seizures (n=2), 
neurocysticercosis and hepatic enzyme increase (n=1 each).  
No clear changes/trends were observed for sexual maturation,  cognitive and behavioral functioning  as 
measured by Tanner scale, Achenbach CBCL, BRIEF-P/BRIEF and PedsQL. 
In summary, no new information regarding efficacy of BRV were reported and the safety findings in 
N01266  were generally consistent  with the  known safety profile of BRV. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No new efficacy or safety concerns were identified in  the study N01266.  Safety profile of the  paediatric 
patients who received BRV treatment and completed the N01266  study was in line with  the established 
safety profile of BRV. Therefore, the benefit-risk ratio remains unchanged. No changes in the SmPC are 
considered necessary.

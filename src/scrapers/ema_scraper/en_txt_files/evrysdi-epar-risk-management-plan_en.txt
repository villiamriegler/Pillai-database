Rationale for Submitting an Updated RMP
The EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) Version 2.0 was prepared for the removal of the 
important potential risk of retinal toxicity with risdiplam due to the absence of evidence of 
retinal toxicity based on thorough ophthalmological monitoring in clinical studies to date.  
As such, the amendments made in EU RMP v2.0 will be restricted only to sections 
relevant for the removal of important potential risk of retinal toxicity.  The other changes 
will be performed in an upcoming RMP update.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
SI.1SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
homozygous mutations of the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 gene (SMN1) that results in 
lack of functional SMN protein which leads to severe dysfunction of motor neurons of the 
spinal cord (Verhaart et al. 2017b). There is a wide range of clinical severity in SMA, and 
the main determinant of disease phenotype is the copy number of the SMN2 gene, a 
low-functioning paralogue of SMN1 (Belter et al. 2018). 
SMA is a spectrum of motor and functional disabilities, characterized by age of onset 
and highest motor milestone achieved. Patients are usually categorized into the 
following four main subtypes based on clinical criteria, including achieving (or failing to 
achieve) physical motor milestones, age of onset, and lifespan (Cobben et al. 2008; 
D'Amico et al. 2011; Farrar et al. 2013; Finkel et al. 2014; Lunn and Wang 2008; Munsat 
and Davies 1992; Sproule 2014; Zerres et al. 1997):



Type 1 SMA (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, approximately 50-60% of SMA births): 
severe infantile type, with an onset before 6 months of age and failure to achieve 
the ability to sit independently, usually requiring feeding and/or ventilation support 
by month 12, with the eventual use of permanent ventilation and death due to 
respiratory distress, usually within 2 years if untreated.
Type 2 SMA (approximately 20-25% of SMA births): intermediate chronic infantile 
type with onset between the age of 7 and 18 months, unable to stand or walk 
independently; these patients are initially able to maintain a sitting position without 
help but eventually become wheelchair-dependent and show a reduced life 
expectancy compared with the general population (up to 30-40 years, if treated 
appropriately).
Type 3 SMA (Kugelberg-Welander disease, approximately 10% of SMA births): mild 
chronic juvenile type with a broad span of age at onset from 18 months into the third 
decade of life, able to stand and walk independently for some period of time. This 
phenotype comprises weaker patients, who progress rapidly to lose ambulation and 
become functionally like patients with Type 2, and stronger patients, who are 
ambulatory for a longer time, but who eventually become progressively weaker and 
wheelchair-dependent. Most Type 3 SMA patients live into adulthood and show a 
normal life span.

Type 4 SMA: rare mild form with adult onset and normal life expectancy. 
A fifth type, denoted as Type 0, has been proposed for extremely severe SMA that 
manifests during fetal life and results in death within a few weeks after birth (Kolb and 
Kissel 2015).

Consistent with disease etiology, several studies have reported a phenotype-genotype 
relationship among patients with SMA, showing that high copy number of SMN2
ameliorates the clinical severity in patients (Feldkotter et al. 2002; Mailman et al. 2002).
The majority of patients with Type 1 SMA have two SMN2 copies; patients with Type 2 
SMA usually have three SMN2 copies; patients with Type 3 SMA have three or four 
SMN2 copies; and patients with Type 4 SMA have four or more SMN2 copies (Crawford 
et al. 2012). SMN2 copy number is currently regarded as a determinant of SMA disease 
severity.
An overview of the clinical characteristics of different subtypes is provided in Table 2. 
The epidemiologic burden of SMA is not equally divided over the subtypes, because of 
the difference in survival patterns across SMA subtypes (Verhaart et al. 2017b). Type 1 
SMA has the highest birth incidence but also the lowest point prevalence, as it is the 
most severe form and historically, more than 90% of Type 1 SMA patients do not survive 
after 2 years of age. Patients with Type 2 SMA, have a longer life expectancy, resulting 
in high prevalence as compared with Type 1 SMA (Verhaart et al. 2017b).

SI.1.1 Incidence
In Europe, 3776 patients were genetically diagnosed within a 5-year period from 2011 to 
2015. The median incidence of SMA from 18 European countries in the period 
2011-2015 was 11.9 per 100,000 (range 6.3-25.5 per 100,000 [~1 in 3900-16,000]). In 
Germany and Croatia, several laboratories have indicated that they perform cross-
border testing, which could account for the higher reported incidence of 25.5 per 
100,000 and 21.1 per 100,000, respectively (Verhaart et al. 2017a). 
A recent systematic review published in 2017 (Verhaart et al. 2017b) found only a few 
incidence estimates for North America with most of them being outdated or originating 
from very local studies (Burd et al. 1991; Prior et al. 2010; Winsor et al. 1971). These 
annual estimates ranged from 6.5 per 100,000 in Canada (Winsor et al. 1971) to 
14.9 per 100,000 in the U.S. (Prior et al. 2010). Despite conducting additional literature 
searches, no recent incidence rates have been identified so far for North America.
Table 3 presents incidence estimates of genetically diagnosed SMA cases, across 
European and American countries.
The epidemiologic burden of SMA is not equally divided over the subtypes. A review of 
the epidemiology literature covering regional and national studies performed in Europe, 
reported an overall incidence rate of 10 per 100,000 live births. The break down by SMA 
type was Type 1 SMA: 5.9 per 100,000, Type 2: 2.7 per 100,000; Type 3: 1.4 per 
100,000 live births (Ogino et al. 2004).

SI.1.2 Prevalence
A large prevalence study (Verhaart et al. 2017a) used two global SMA registries: the 
Global SMA Patient Registry and the Care and Trial Site Registry (CTSR), together 
covering 46 countries. In these data sources, SMA diagnoses relied on genetic testing 
for SMN1 and/or clinical examination. In 2015, the global prevalence rates of all-type 
SMA ranged from 0.01 to 2.43 per 100,000 in the Global Patient Registry and from 
0.00 to 4.11 per 100,000 in the CTSR. Except five older studies focusing on very small 
areas (Czeizel and Hamula 1989; Forsgren et al. 1983; Merlini et al. 1992; Mostacciuolo 
et al. 1992; Tangsrud and Halvorsen 1988), all other selected studies provided 
consistent prevalence estimates which were included within the aforementioned range. 
Of the 21 European countries investigated (Verhaart et al. 2017a), prevalence estimates 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
risdiplam
17
of
932
for all-type SMA were 0.64 and 0.70 per 100,000 in the Global SMA Patient Registry and 
the CTSR, respectively. The total number of SMA patients in 2005 was thus comprised 
between 2,458 and 3,441 for a total population catchment area of 490,278,605 
inhabitants. Denmark had the highest prevalence rates for both registries (2.43 and 
4.11 per 100,000 respectively) while Ireland presented the lowest rate (i.e., 0.00 per 
100,000 in the CTSR). In the U.S. and Canada, the point prevalence as on 1 September 
2015 ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 per 100,000 population (Verhaart et al. 2017a) (Table 4).
Although SMA Type 1 is expected to account for more than half of all new SMA cases, 
evidence from literature sources for SMA Type 1 showed a prevalence of only 0.10 (in 
the UK) to 0.28 (in Sweden) per 100,000 population. Due to severe motor impairment, 
patients with SMA type 1 have a very short life expectancy. The prevalence for SMA 
Type 2 ranged from 0.57 (in UK) to 3.66 (in Norway) per 100,000 population, while the 
prevalence for SMA Type 3 ranged from 0.35 (in Norway) to 1.39 (in Sweden) per 
100,000 (Verhaart et al. 2017b) (Table 5). With the advent of disease modifying 
therapies, these prevalences will probably shift considerably in future decades.

SI.1.3 Demographics
The Cure SMA database is one of the largest patient-reported databases for people 
affected with SMA. Individuals with self-reported SMA were identified from the database 
with a date of first contact to Cure SMA between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 
2016 in the U.S. A total of 1966 SMA patients were included in the study. Of these 
individuals, 51.9% had Type 1, 32.3% had Type 2, and 15.8% had Type 3 SMA (Belter 
et al. 2018). Males and females were represented equally, and no statistically significant 
difference was observed between gender and type of SMA. Demographic information of 
SMA patients available from the Cure SMA database is represented in Table 6.
According to Global SMA Patient Registry, among all the SMA patients worldwide, 66% 
were from Europe, 18% from North America, 10% from Asia, and 5% from Central and 
South America. Patients were predominantly of Type 2 etiology (45%), followed by 
Type 3 (32%), Type 1 (18.4%), and 5% unknown. Demographic information of SMA

SI.1.4 Main Existing Treatment Options
The intrathecally administered SMN2-targeting anti-sense oligonucleotide nusinersen 
(SPINRAZA) has been approved for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult 
patients. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (ZOLGENSMA), a gene-replacement therapy 
that uses a non-replicating adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid to deliver a functional 
copy of the SMN gene by intravenous infusion, has been approved in the United States, 
European Union and other jurisdictions for patients with SMA 2 years of age. Despite 
the availability of these treatment options, a clear unmet medical need remains for this 
patient population (Noone et al. 2019).
SI.1.5 Risk Factors for the Disease
SMA is a monogenic neuromuscular autosomal recessive disorder secondary to 
loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene 
with subsequent loss of SMN protein expression. In humans, there are two SMN genes, 
the SMN1 gene and its paralog SMN2. The SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) 
undergoes alternative splicing that excludes exon 7 from 85%90% of mature SMN2
transcripts, which produces an unstable SMN7 protein that is rapidly degraded so that 
full-length SMN2 mRNA is generated in only 10%15% of splicing events (Markowitz et 
al. 2012; Monani et al. 1999). Accordingly, patients with SMA lacking a functioning 
SMN1 gene are dependent on their SMN2 gene and SMA is the consequence of 
decreased, insufficient levels of full-length SMN protein produced by the SMN2 gene. 
SI.1.6 Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the (Untreated) 
Population 
Natural history demonstrates that 50% of infants with Type 1 SMA will have died or 
required permanent daily noninvasive ventilation support by 10.5 months of age and 
92% by 20 months of age (Finkel et al. 2014). Patients with Type 2 SMA have a decline 
in motor function over time, most prominently during the ages of 6 to 16 years, as 
reported in a number of publications with different motor function measures, i.e., the 
Motor Function Measure 32-item version (MFM32) (Vuillerot et al. 2013), the 
Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (Mercuri et al. 2018), and the Revised 
Upper Limb Module (Pera et al. 2019). Patients with Type III SMA decline in motor 
function over time most prominently during the ages of 10 to 15 years and nearly a third 
will lose their ability to walk between ages 328 years (Vuillerot et al. 2013). Type 4 SMA 
represents less than 1% of all SMA patients and is the mildest form of the recognized 
disease continuum, characterized by mild proximal muscle weakness predominantly 
affecting the leg and hip muscles which may progress to the shoulders and arms. Life 
expectancy is not affected in Type 4 SMA (Arnold et al. 2015). With the advent of 
disease modifying therapies (SI.1.4Main Existing Treatment Options) the natural history 
of SMA is dramatically changing.
A cross-sectional study of pregnancy among confirmed SMA patients indicated that 
preterm labor and delivery by cesarean section were more common in mothers with

risdiplam
21

932
SMA, particularly SMA Type 2. About two-thirds of pregnant patients reported increased 
weakness during pregnancy, which persisted in 42% even after delivery 
(Elsheikh et al. 2017). A recent literature review indicated that premature labor and C-
section rates are higher in SMA patients; however, the incidence of maternal and fetal 
complications among SMA patients was not higher than the general population (Abati et 
al. 2018). The literature surrounding the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes among 
SMA patients is based on case reports or retrospective studies of small number of 
patients and the maternal and fetal risks of SMA are largely unknown.
SI.1.7 Important Comorbidities
SMA is a genetic disorder therefore non-SMA related comorbidities in patients with SMA 
share the same distribution as in the general population.
The section below describes therefore the most relevant clinical features of SMA.
Overall, SMA comprises a wide spectrum of clinical conditions characterized by a 
selective degeneration of spinal motor neurons within the CNS, along with a complex 
profile of accompanying symptoms that point to the crucial systemic role of the SMN 
protein (Faravelli et al. 2015).

Newborns with SMA Type 0 present with failure to swallow and breathe, facial diplegia, 
and joint contractures.
Patients with Type 1 SMA display generalized muscular weakness with severe 
hypotonia, often displaying ‘floppy infant syndrome’ (ragdoll-like limpness). Infants can 
present with a typical frog-leg position owing to hypotonia of proximal muscles. Impaired 
ribcage expansion can cause a bell-shape-like conformation of the thorax, with a relative 
sparing of the diaphragm. Deep tendon reflexes can be decreased or absent. Difficulties 
in breathing and feeding are invariably present. Tongue fasciculation and weak cry are 
consequences of the involvement of bulbar motor neurons. High level cognitive functions 
seem to be spared. Congenital heart defects with potential impairment of the cardiac 
autonomic innervation have been reported in severe Type 1 SMA (Faravelli et al. 2015). 
Children with Type 2 SMA show delay in reaching developmental milestones for gross 
motor skills. Bulbar function impairment manifesting as swallowing difficulties which may 
lead to poor weight gain, difficulty in chewing, nasal regurgitation, slurring of speech, 
difficulty in handling secretions, aspiration of liquids, dysphonia (defective use of the 
voice, inability to produce sound due to laryngeal weakness) and dysarthria. Intercostal 
muscles are weak, and some are also diaphragmatic breathers. They have difficulty 
coughing and clearing tracheal secretion. They have fine tremors with extended fingers 
or when attempting hand grips. Kyphoscoliosis eventually develops, and bracing or 
spinal surgery is needed.
Patients with Type 3 SMA present with varying degrees of muscular hypotonia and 
weakness, with a preferential wasting of proximal muscle groups. Bulbar motor neuron 
involvement is less frequent than in more severe forms of SMA. Loss of ambulation 
usually occurs before or around puberty.
Individuals with Type 4 SMA can manifest signs of spinal motor neuron degeneration, 
such as flaccid hypotonia, fasciculations, muscular atrophy and decreased deep tendon 
reflexes. The disease course is stable and mild (Wang et al. 2007).
PART II: MODULE SII NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
TOXICOLOGY AND SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY
SII.1
Overall, toxicology findings can be grouped into two distinct categories according to the 
duration of treatment with risdiplam needed to induce these effects:


Retinal degeneration, which occurs after prolonged dosing and whose mechanism 
is not fully understood
Adverse effects related to secondary splice targets, occurring with acute/subacute 
dosing and which include effects on organs with rapid cell turnover and teratogenic 
effects.

While retinal degeneration is a delayed type of toxicity, which is not reversible in terms of 
photoreceptor loss, effects mediated by interaction with secondary splice targets are 
more immediate in their onset (time course similar to the onset of the effect on the 
primary splice target SMN2) and reversible in their nature.
A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established for risdiplam in all pivotal 
toxicity studies for genotoxicity, repeat dose toxicity, juvenile toxicity, reproductive 
toxicity and carcinogenicity. 
In vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies have not shown any evidence for any 
effects of risdiplam on cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory functions.
An overview of the key toxicities observed in animal studies and their safety margins (or 
ratios of exposure for retinal changes and male germ cell effects) at mean exposure in 
SMA patients is provided in Table 9. An overview of key toxicology findings with 
translatability to humans is given below (Table 10 and following sections).

SII.1.1 Delayed (Retinal) Toxicity
Retinal findings, which are likely of delayed nature (diagnosed with approximately 
5 months of treatment and lack of earlier data) and potentially related to the 
physicochemical properties of risdiplam (rather than secondary splice targets), were 
diagnosed in-life in all monkeys after daily oral treatment above no observed effect level 
(NOEL). These findings were partly irreversible (in terms of photoreceptor degeneration), 
and started to occur at exposures higher than twice the mean exposure guidance set for 
the ongoing clinical trials.
The exact mechanism for the delayed type of retinal toxicity seen in the monkey with 
risdiplam is presently unknown.  Impairment of autophagosomal function has been 
observed in vitro in human RPEs and this in vitro property of risdiplam is possibly related 
to the retinal effects seen in monkeys.  Comprehensive clinical monitoring data focused 
on the nature of the observations in monkeys and with a sufficient duration of chronic 
dosing and obtained under the conditions of the clinical trials confirm the absence of 
retinal toxicity and thus do not point towards an effect of risdiplam on the retina in 
patients with SMA (SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important 
Potential Risks).

SII.1.2 Adverse Effects Related to Secondary Splice Targets
Risks related to secondary splice target effects with early onset and involving genes, 
other than SMN2, mainly play a role in cell division and apoptosis:

Decreased sperm count and degeneration of spermatocytes (at systemic exposures 
similar to the mean exposure in clinical trials [2010 ngh/mL, AUC0-24]).
 Micronucleus formation in bone marrow with a clear NOAEL, including mechanistic 
information related to secondary effects to apoptosis at approximately 1.5-fold of the 
mean exposure in clinical trials.


Bone marrow suppression with decreased cellularity at higher exposures than those 
for micronucleus induction, i.e., above 4-fold of the mean exposure in patients.
Skin and mucosa (mainly parakeratosis) at 2.5-fold above mean exposure in 
patients. These effects were dose-dependent, with early onset within several days 
and up to approximately 2 weeks of treatment and reversible following 
discontinuation of risdiplam.
All of these risks are considered of human relevance (see Table 10). Above the NOAEL, 
findings were consistently observed in a substantial subset of animals treated. All effects 
were shown to be reversible in animal studies or are deemed to be fully reversible based 
on scientific rationales and class effect data.
Degeneration of germ cells, which is considered to be of special clinical relevance, is 
discussed in more detail below.
Male Germ Cells
The potential risk of adverse effects on human sperm has not been characterized in 
clinical studies. Consistent observation of this effect in monkeys and rats, including 
similar findings for other small molecule SMN2 splice modifiers, suggest that this risk is a 
class effect and that it may translate to humans and could occur at the therapeutic 
exposures. Spermatocyte degeneration is most likely an effect of risdiplam on splice 
targets other than SMN2. The effect seems to be reversible by nature since no effects 
were noted on Sertoli cells or on primordial germ cells, which therefore retain their 
function to differentiate into spermatozoa once normal FOXM1 expression (and/or 
another affected splice target) has resumed. Indeed, the effect was reversible in animal 
studies after discontinuation of treatment, as confirmed with other SMN2 splice modifiers 
of the same class. Thus, in terms of clinical management of this effect, any impact on 
fertility in human males is expected to be reversible after one cycle of spermatogenesis. 
Therefore, normal fertility function would be restored within 4 months (one cycle of 
spermatogenesis plus 5 half-lives of risdiplam after the last dose).
SII.1.3 Reversibility of Toxicological Findings
All of the findings of toxicological significance (retina, male germ cells, hematology, 
digestive system, skin) induced by risdiplam in mice, rats or monkeys were studied for 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
risdiplam
28
of
932
reversibility. Full or partial reversibility was shown for all of these findings with the 
exception of the effects on photoreceptor degeneration in the retina in the monkey. Only 
partial reversibility was shown for male sperm cell changes in some studies primarily due 
to recovery periods chosen being too short for a full spermatogenic cycle (8-week 
recovery periods in the 13-week juvenile rat and 26-week adult rat studies); in other 
cases, animals were not adult (monkey studies). However, full reversibility for male germ 
cell changes is postulated [1093542] based on evidence of partial reversibility in the rat 
and studies with another splice modifier with similar mode of action on SMN2 and 
secondary splice targets, RO6885247, in the monkey.
SII.1.4 Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity
Risdiplam was not mutagenic in bacterial tests and there was no evidence of primary 
DNA-damage in vivo following risdiplam administration. Consistent with its effects on cell 
division and apoptosis, risdiplam-induced MN in bone marrow as part of a non-DNA 
reactive mechanism. Since the effect is not on the DNA, it is considered to be reversible 
and damage cannot be passed onto subsequent cell generations. At higher doses, the 
damage manifests as reduction in cellularity in bone marrow, an effect, which is 
monitored in SMA patients with hematology investigation.
Risdiplam is not tumorigenic in animals when tested in a transgenic model suitable to 
address non-genotoxic and genotoxic mechanisms to tumorigenesis. Risdiplam is used 
to treat a severe, life threatening disease, and hence a standard 2-year carcinogenicity 
study in the rat was deferred to be initiated after submission for approval to facilitate an 
accelerated clinical development and availability for patients. The study has been 
initiated with dosing started in Q3 2020 and is planned to be reported in Q3 2023 in 
order to facilitate a full risk-benefit assessment with the availability of the full rodent 
carcinogenicity data upon lifetime treatment, as set out in the ICH S1 guidelines. Roche 
commits to provide the results of this study to the CHMP.
SII.1.5 Reproductive Toxicity
Studies with radiolabeled risdiplam in pregnant and lactating rats indicate that risdiplam 
may cross the placental barrier in pregnant women and may be excreted in milk in 
breastfeeding women. These findings are consistent with its physicochemical properties, 
such as high permeability.
Consistent with its effects on cell division and apoptosis, treatment of pregnant rabbits 
with risdiplam has been associated with maternal toxicity and teratogenicity, with a 
NOAEL at exposures of ~4 times the mean exposure guidance in clinical trials. No 
teratogenicity was observed in rats up to ~5 times the clinical mean exposure guidance, 
but embryofetal toxicity (reduced fetal weight and delayed fetal development) was noted, 
with a NOAEL slightly in excess of 2-fold the mean exposure guidance without maternal 
toxicity. Even though teratogenicity was only noted in the rabbit at a maternally toxic

29
of
932
dose level, the possibility of a dysmorphogenic potential of risdiplam in the human 
cannot be discounted.
Although COX1 and COX2 inhibition can affect parturition in human (Urrego et al. 2019),
it is thought that secondary pharmacodynamic effects of risdiplam on COX1/COX2 
shown in vitro may not be relevant for in vivo conditions in human even at the maximal 
free plasma concentrations achieved with the recommended doses. The IC50 for COX1 
and COX2 inhibition by risdiplam is ~800 ng/mL, compared with the maximum free Cmax
of ~27 ng/mL observed for risdiplam in clinical studies in SMA patients of reproductive 
age.
SII.1.6 Safety Pharmacology and Abuse Liability
A complete in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology study package has not shown any 
evidence for any effects of risdiplam on cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory functions.
Receptor interactions of potential animal and human relevance based on their IC50 and 
further functional assessment were found for risdiplam and its major human metabolite 
M1 only for COX1 and COX2 and for acetylcholinesterase. However, side effects known 
in the context of inhibition of COX1 and COX2 (bleeding, ulceration, erosions in the GI 
tract) have not been observed in animal studies with risdiplam. Similarly, effects known 
for inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (cholinergic effects) have not been seen in the 
animal safety pharmacology and toxicity studies with risdiplam. Effects of COX1 and 
COX2 on parturition are discussed in SII.1.5 Reproductive Toxicity.
Receptor-ligand binding studies do not indicate abuse-related signals.
SII.1.7 Phototoxicity
The phototoxic potential of risdiplam is considered low or negligible because free 
plasma/tissue concentrations of more than 9000 ng/mL (the maximal concentration 
evaluated in an in vitro test) are not expected in the clinical use of risdiplam.
AGE DIFFERENCES IN PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING
SII.2
Major differences in tolerability after daily oral gavage treatment with risdiplam between 
the pre- and post-weaning phase were observed in rats, with deaths occurring after a 
few days of treatment starting on PND4 at doses that were tolerated well when treatment 
was started post-weaning. These differences were correlated with increased free plasma 
exposure due to differences in plasma protein binding and clearance, with pre-weaning 
pups showing a much higher plasma free fraction and longer half-life of risdiplam in 
plasma than post-weaning and adult rats. The age-dependency was less pronounced in 
mice and monkeys.
In contrast to juvenile animals, risdiplam showed similar plasma protein binding in 
human blood sampled at various ages from birth to adulthood (non-SMA and Type 1, 2, 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
risdiplam
30
of
932
and 3 SMA patients). Hence, no major differences in tolerability due to age-related 
variation in plasma protein binding are expected for the pediatric SMA population.
SII.3 METABOLISM AND MAJOR METABOLITE M1
Any possible clinical risk stemming from the covalent binding potential of risdiplam 
detected in vitro is considered low based on the clinical dose of maximally 5 mg and the 
low in vitro potency for covalent interactions.
Human exposure to the major human metabolite (M1) is qualified in all key toxicology 
studies (repeat dose toxicity, juvenile toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive 
toxicity) at the respective NOAELs. In vitro, M1 is devoid of any significant primary 
(SMN2 splicing) or secondary (FOXM1 splicing) pharmacological effect or potential for 
pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction (DDI) at therapeutic doses of risdiplam.
DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION
SII.4
The effect of coadministration of risdiplam on the pharmacokinetics of MATE1 and 
MATE2-K substrates in humans is unknown. Based on in vitro data, risdiplam may 
increase plasma concentrations of drugs eliminated via MATE1 or MATE2-K, such as 
metformin and fexofenadine. 
In vitro investigations suggested a potential for DDI effects, by either risdiplam or M1, on 
concomitant medications which are CYP3A4 substrates. The clinical relevance of 
CYP3A4 inhibition was evaluated in a DDI study (BP41361) with midazolam in healthy 
volunteers. In this study, the administration of risdiplam slightly increased the exposure 
of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate). As such, this study confirmed that there is 
no clinically relevant DDI between risdiplam and CYP3A4 substrates. Based on 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, a similar magnitude of effect is 
expected in children and infants as young as 2 months old.
SII.5 OVERALL CONCLUSION
Retinal toxicity observed in monkey was initially considered an important potential risk 
(see SVII.2 NEW SAFETY CONCERNS AND RECLASSIFICATION WITH A 
SUBMISSION OF AN UPDATED RMP) but is no longer considered a potential risk due 
to absence of findings following thorough ophthalmological monitoring in 486 patients for 
up to 5.15 years (Drug Safety Report [DSR] No. 1127141). 
Further, sperm cell toxicity and embryofetal toxicity are identified risks in nonclinical 
studies which are deemed relevant for human use and embryofetal toxicity is considered 
an important potential risk (see SVII.3.1.
and Important Potential Risks). Further risks for GI, skin and hematology as described in 
Table 10 have been fully addressed in the clinical studies conducted so far.

investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and 
efficacy of risdiplam in infants (aged 1 to 7 months at enrollment) with Type 1 SMA. The 
study consists of a dose-finding Part 1 and a confirmatory Part 2 at the dose selected in 
Part 1. A total of 21 patients were enrolled in Part 1 of the study. Following selection of 
the dose for Part 2, patients in Part 1 entered an extension phase to continue treatment 
at the dose selected for Part 2 (referred to as the pivotal dose). Patients in Part 1 did not 
enter Part 2 of the trial. 
Part 2 is a pivotal, single-arm study of risdiplam in 41 infants with Type 1 SMA treated 
for 24 months, followed by an open-label extension (OLE). The primary analysis of 
Part 2 was conducted once the last patient in Part 2 completed 12 months of treatment. 
Safety data from a total of 62 patients with Type 1 SMA (21 patients from Part 1; 
41 patients from Part 2) up to the clinical cutoff date (CCOD) of 12 November 2020 are 
available and included in this analysis. This is the timepoint at which all patients in Part 2 
had completed the 24-month assessment of treatment with risdiplam and all patients in 
Part 1 had been dose-escalated to the pivotal dose. As of the CCOD, 55 patients had 
completed the 24-month treatment period of Part 2 and entered the OLE phase.
Study BP39055 (SUNFISH) is a two-part, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind study to investigate safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and efficacy of risdiplam in 
patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA (aged 2 to 25 years). The study consists of a dose-
finding Part 1 and a confirmatory Part 2 at the dose selected in Part 1. A total of 
51 patients were enrolled in Part 1 of the study. Patients who were assigned to placebo 
were switched to active treatment at the dose tested in their respective cohort after a 
minimum 12-week placebo-controlled treatment period. After selection of the dose for 
Part 2 (referred to as the pivotal dose), all patients in Part 1 received the pivotal dose as 
part of an OLE phase. Patients in Part 1 did not enter Part 2 of the trial. 
Overall, safety data from 231 patients with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA are included in the 
safety analyses. These data include:


51 patients from Part 1 of the study included in the analyses at the CCOD of 
15 January 2020. 35 patients were treated with risdiplam from randomization and 
16 patients were switched from placebo during or after the dose selection period. At 
the CCOD in January 2020, all patients from Part 1 of the study (except one who 
had withdrawn consent) were in the OLE and had been treated for a minimum of 
2 years with the pivotal dose.
180 patients (RIS: n=120, PLB=60) from Part 2 of the study at the CCOD of 30 
September 2020, when the last patient in Part 2 completed 24 months of treatment.

Part 2 patients randomized to placebo were switched to risdiplam after completion 
of 12 months of study treatment.
Study BP39054 (JEWELFISH) is an open-label, non-comparative study in SMA patients 
previously enrolled in Roche Study BP29420 (MOONFISH) with the splicing modifier 
RO6885247 (development discontinued) or previously treated with SPINRAZA
(nusinersen), Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec, AVXS-101), or olesoxime 
(previous Roche acquired development compound, since discontinued) in which 
treatment with risdiplam is evaluated over a 24-month period. Study enrollment has been 
completed with 174 patients; these 174 patients had previously received either 
nusinersen (N76), RO6885247 (N13), olesoxime (N=71), or AVXS-101 (N=14). Safety 
data up to the CCOD of 29 January 2021 (corresponding to the date when the last 
patient in the study completed the Month 12 visit) from 173 out of these 174 patients 
enrolled are included in the analyses.
Study BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH) is a study to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and PK/PD of risdiplam in pre-symptomatic infants from birth to 6 weeks who were 
genetically diagnosed with SMA. The study is currently recruiting; up to the CCOD of 
1 July 2021, 18 patients had been enrolled. 
Table 11 summarizes key design features, safety populations, and data cutoff dates for 
all four studies in this RMP.
Clinical trial exposure data are presented for risdiplam by duration of exposure 
(Table 12), age group and gender (Table 13), ethnic or racial origin (Table 14), pivotal 
dose (Table 15), and pivotal dose by individual dose level (Table 16). Included are 
483 patients with symptomatic or presymptomatic SMA from BP39056 (FIREFISH), 
BP39055 (SUNFISH), BP39054 (JEWELFISH) and BN40703 (RAINBOWFISH).

SIV.1 EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN PIVOTAL CLINICAL STUDIES WITHIN THE 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Specific exclusion criteria discussed in this section are those from the two pivotal studies 
which are the basis for the approval of the use of risdiplam in SMA (BP39055 
[SUNFISH] and BP39056 [FIREFISH], Table 11) and supporting Study BN40703 
(RAINBOWFISH). Exclusion criteria are generally consistent among these studies. The 
key exclusion criteria are summarized in Table 17, and patients who met any of the 
criteria were excluded from study entry.

Reason for Exclusion
Concomitant or previous administration of a 
SMN2-targeting anti-sense oligonucleotide, 
SMN2 splicing modifier or gene therapy either 
in a clinical study or as part of medical care
Confounding factors such as previous 
treatment for SMA can impact the data and 
ability to understand the efficacy profile of the 
drug under study (risdiplam).
Any history of cell therapy
Multiple or fixed contractures and/or hip 
subluxation or dislocation at birth
Surgery for scoliosis or hip fixation in the one 
year preceding screening or planned within 
the next 18 months
Unstable gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, 
endocrine, or cardiovascular system diseases
Confounding factors such as previous cell 
therapy can impact the data and ability to 
understand the efficacy profile of the drug 
under study (risdiplam).
Any possible confounding conditions that can

Rationale
(if not included as missing information)
Safety in patients on previous treatment 
with SMN2 splicing modifiers or gene 
therapy is available from BP39054 
(JEWELFISH).  
Significant exposure to stem cell therapy 
in SMA is not expected.
Patients with contractures are not 
expected to be at higher risk of adverse 
reactions to risdiplam.
Patients with scoliosis or hip surgery in the 
last year are not expected to be at higher 
risk of adverse reactions to risdiplam. 
There are no gastrointestinal, 
cardiovascular, renal or endocrine adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) Study BP40995 did 
not show any significant impact of mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment on the PK of 
risdiplam.

Reason for Exclusion
For patients aged 2 years, hospitalization for 
a pulmonary event within 2 months prior to 
screening and pulmonary function not fully 
recovered at the time of screening
Any possible confounding conditions that can 
impact the data and ability to understand the 
efficacy profile of the drug under study 
(risdiplam) were excluded.
Is it to be 
included as 
missing 
information? 
(Yes/No)
No
Pregnant women
Lactating women
Based on the findings from animal studies, 
risdiplam crosses the placental barrier and 
may cause fetal harm. Pregnant women were 
excluded because risdiplam has shown 
embryofetal toxicity in animals. 
No
It is not known whether risdiplam is excreted 
in human breast milk. Studies in rats show 
that risdiplam is excreted into milk. Lactating 
women were excluded due to unknown 
effects of risdiplam on the breastfed baby.
No
Rationale
(if not included as missing information)
In patients below 2 years of age (Patients 
with Type 1 SMA Pool), SAEs which were 
mostly infections and respiratory 
complications resolved despite ongoing 
treatment with risdiplam. Also the rate of 
SAEs declined over time. Overall this does 
not suggest a less favourable safety profile 
of risdiplam in patients with hospitalization 
due to pulmonary event. 
There are no clinical data from the use of 
risdiplam in pregnant women and 
embryofetal toxicity is assessed as an 
important potential risk. Sections 4.4 
(Special warnings and precautions for use; 
Embryofetal toxicity) and 4.6 (Fertility, 
pregnancy and lactation) of the SmPC 
advises women of reproductive potential to 
avoid pregnancy.
There are no clinical data from use of 
risdiplam in breastfeeding mothers during 
lactation Section 4.6 (Fertility, pregnancy 
and lactation) of the SmPC advises 
women to either discontinue breastfeeding 
or discontinue risdiplam therapy.

No
Rationale
(if not included as missing information)
No indication that safety profile of 
risdiplam adversely affected by 
tachycardia/bradycardia or 
increased/decreased blood pressure given 
there are no cardiovascular risks 
associated with risdiplam. 
No increased risk in patients with clinically 
significant ECG abnormalities expected 
based on absence of any significant ECG 
findings or cardiovascular risks in 
risdiplam clinical trials and absence of any 
exposure-dependent ECG abnormalities in 
particular QT prolongation.
Based on nonclinical 6-month 
carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic 
mice, risdiplam is not expected to increase 
rate of malignancies. A carcinogenicity 
study in rats with lifetime dosing (~2 years) 
is ongoing.
Risdiplam has been safe and well 
tolerated in all clinical studies. Also 
risdiplam did not show an increased risk 
for infections or serious infections and 
adverse events generally resolved despite 
ongoing treatment with risdiplam It is 
considered part of routine practice to

No
Rationale
(if not included as missing information)
No findings of retinal toxicity observed 
across all clinical studies. Information to 
prescribers on retinal toxicity in nonclinical 
studies provided in label, no restriction 
required re use of concomitant drugs with 
potential retinal toxicity.
Because of the absorption of risdiplam in 
the UV range, the potential for 
phototoxicity was studied in vitro on a 
neutral red uptake test with 3T3 cells. The 
phototoxic potential of risdiplam is 
considered low or negligible as free 
plasma/tissue concentrations of more than 
9 g/mL are not expected in the clinical 
use of risdiplam. No impact of the UV 
absorption potential on the retinal toxicity 
of risdiplam is expected, as the retina is 
not exposed to wavelengths shorter than 
~400 nM.
In clinical studies with risdiplam, no 
adverse events indicating potential 
phototoxicity were observed. 
Hypersensitivity to risdiplam or to any of 
the constituents of its formulation is a 
potential risk (not important) and is 
included as a contraindication in the

of
932
Risdiplam is currently approved in approximately 100 countries.  Due to inventory, it was 
not possible to use standard patient number calculation from Company Internal sales 
data.
For the United States, cumulative exposure was calculated as “the sum of all new 
commercial patients each month from the international birth date (IBD; 7 August 2020) 
until July 2023” and “the sum of all patients on free goods from IBD until July 2023.” 
Note: All expanded access program patients in the U.S. were converted to commercial 
patients. The number of patients on free goods were derived from commercial patients 
under the assumption that free goods this year accounts to 20% of total sales.
Total estimated patient exposures were directly reported by affiliates for 28 countries 
(out of 82) having sales.  For the remaining 54 countries, patient numbers were 
estimated using extrapolation based on reported patient numbers and volume from 
Company Internal sales data.  Age splits were derived by countries that reported patient 
splits. It is the average of actual age splits reported by aforementioned 28 countries
(Table 19).  The source for the gender split was the epidemiology model (Table 20).  
For Japan, patient exposure is in 'patient numbers'. The estimation of the market 
exposure to risdiplam in this RMP was based on direct reporting from physicians.  Age 
splits were based on Japanese Real-world data.  The source for the gender split was 
published data (Ito et al. 2022).

PART II: MODULE SVI ADDITIONAL E.U. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION
POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES
Although risdiplam penetrates well into the brain, it is not expected to lead to abuse or 
dependency for the following reasons:






There is neither nonclinical nor current clinical evidence supporting any CNS effects 
which would induce misuse for illegal purposes:  
Although risdiplam may potentially bind to neuromelanin in the brain in analogy to its 
binding to retinal melanin, this property is common to many drugs. Given that it has 
been shown that melanin-binding per se did not confer retinal toxicity in pigmented 
rats, the binding of risdiplam to neuromelanin does not imply toxicity. 
In nonclinical studies no pathological changes were observed in sections in brain 
tissue, in particular high melanin-containing substantia nigra of the mid-brain after 
chronic treatment in monkeys.
There is no evidence for accumulation of risdiplam in the brain given that it reaches 
equal total concentrations in brain tissue and plasma. Furthermore, the free 
concentrations in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are comparable in 
animals.
The molecular mechanism of splicing modification of the SMN2 gene or other 
secondary splice targets seen in vitro or in animal studies/tissues does not suggest 
an engagement of neuronal signaling pathways involved in dependency and abuse. 
An in vitro screen specifically designed to capture targets known to be involved in 
abuse and dependence has not shown effects on such targets at concentrations in 
the range of potential concentrations in patients with SMA [1087510].
Numerous nonclinical studies with risdiplam demonstrated that there were no 
observed behavioral changes suggestive of abuse potential or detrimental effects 
on the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.
A thorough review of safety information obtained in patients and subjects exposed to 
risdiplam concluded that there was no indication of abuse or dependence-related AEs.
Based on the mechanistic, bio-distribution, nonclinical, and clinical data, the MAA 
concludes that risdiplam does not have CNS activity associated with abuse potential and 
dependence and therefore no additional abuse and dependence-related studies are 
required.

SUBMISSION
SVII.1.1Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP
Reason for NOT including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP:
Known risks that have an impact on the benefit-risk profile but are not associated with 
additional pharmacovigilance or risk-minimization activities, beyond labeling:


Potential risk of effects on male fertility 
Potential risk of toxicities of MATE1/2-K substrates with narrow therapeutic margin 
concomitantly administered with risdiplam 
Risks observed in nonclinical trials that were not confirmed to be potential or identified 
risk in the clinical trials conducted in humans: 

Potential risk of hematological effects
SVII.1.2Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP
Important Identified Risks: None
Important Potential Risk of Retinal toxicity
Risk-benefit impact: 
A comprehensive panel of ophthalmological assessments was performed including 
imaging to detect structural changes of the retina as well as visual function testing to 
detect potential functional impairment in central or peripheral vision. No adverse event or 
ophthalmologic assessment finding suggestive of risdiplam-induced retinal toxicity were 
reported in any patient exposed to risdiplam up to the CCOD for each study. With the 
extensive ophthalmological monitoring up to at least 8 weeks in 405 patients, for at least 
1 year in 273 patients, for at least 2 years in 72 patients and for at least 3 years in 
12 patients, there is evidence of an absence of retinal toxicity in patients exposed to 
risdiplam for up to 3 years. 
In comparison, delayed retinal toxicity became apparent in a nonclinical monkey study 
after an estimated 2-5 months (see SII.1.1 Delayed (Retinal) Toxicity). Moreover, the 
theoretical impact of non-reversible retinal toxicity on the individual patient is expected to 
consist primarily of impaired peripheral vision/night vision. Based on nonclinical 
observations, significant impairment of central vision or blindness would not be 
expected. This potential risk may result in persistent disability. The clinical significance of 
this potential disability must be viewed in the context of the severity of the underlying 
disease but could be considered as significant in particular for patients with milder 
clinical course of SMA.

Important Potential Risk:  Effect on epithelial tissues
Risk-benefit impact:
The benefit-risk impact of this potential risk is low given that the events observed would 
be reversible and would be observed only in case of overdose. Temporary 
discontinuation of treatment with subsequent re-initiation at the recommended dose 
would ensure management of this risk and allow the patient to continue benefiting from 
the therapeutic effects of risdiplam.
Important Potential Risk:  Embryofetal toxicity
Risk-benefit impact:
There are no adequate data on the developmental risks associated with use of risdiplam 
in pregnant women. 
In studies in pregnant rats treated with risdiplam, embryofetal toxicity with lower fetal 
weight and delayed development was evident. The NOAEL for this effect was 
approximately two fold above the exposure levels reached at the therapeutic dose of 
risdiplam in patients. In studies with pregnant rabbits, dysmorphogenic effects were 
observed at exposures also associated with maternal toxicity. These consisted of four 
fetuses (4%) from 4 litters (22%) with hydrocephaly. The NOAEL was approximately four 
times the exposure levels reached at the therapeutic dose of risdiplam in patients. In a 
pre- and post-natal study in rats treated daily with risdiplam, risdiplam caused a slight 
delay in gestation length. 
Although this potential risk could result in persistent disability in infants born from 
mothers with SMA treated with risdiplam, the nonclinical data suggest that normal 
pregnancies could be possible. Normal pregnancies have been reported in patients with 
SMA who often wish to have own children (Abati et al. 2018). The potential risk of 
embryofetal toxicity can therefore have a significant impact on the overall benefit-risk of 
risdiplam in female patients wishing to conceive. 
1.1.1.1
Risk-benefit impact: 
Missing Information of Long-term Safety
There is no evidence for any risks associated with chronic treatment of risdiplam in 
clinical studies (where patients have been treated for up to 42 months). In nonclinical 
studies, risks associated with long-term treatment have not been identified (up to 
9 months of chronic treatment in monkeys, equivalent to several years of human life, and 
6 months in rats, equivalent to more than 10 years of human life).
There remains, however, the possibility of delayed onset of currently unknown risks 
other than potential retinal toxicity, justifying the inclusion of long-term safety as missing 
information.

SVII.2 NEW SAFETY CONCERNS AND RECLASSIFICATION WITH A 
SUBMISSION OF AN UPDATED RMP
Important Potential Risk of Retinal Toxicity:
The risk of retinal toxicity is no longer considered a potential risk due to the absence of 
findings following thorough ophthalmological monitoring in 486 patients for up to 
5.15 years (Refer to DSR No. 1127141 for additional information).

SVII.3.1.
Potential Risks
Information on Important Identified Risks
There are no important identified risks for risdiplam.
Information on Important Potential Risks
Embryofetal Toxicity
Potential mechanisms: 
The potential effect on embryofetal development is secondary to risdiplam’s effect on 
cell division and apoptosis associated with alternative splicing of secondary splice target 
genes (FOXM1 and MADD genes).
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
Consistent with its effects on cell division and apoptosis, treatment of pregnant rabbits 
with risdiplam has been associated with maternal toxicity and teratogenicity, with a 
NOAEL at exposures of ~4 times the mean exposure guidance in clinical trials. No 
teratogenicity was observed in rats up to ~5 times the clinical mean exposure guidance, 
but embryofetal toxicity (reduced fetal weight and delayed fetal development) was noted, 
with a NOAEL slightly in excess of 2-fold the mean exposure guidance without maternal 
toxicity. Even though teratogenicity was only noted in the rabbit at a maternally toxic 
dose level, the possibility of a dysmorphogenic potential of risdiplam in the human 
cannot be discounted.
Characterization of the risk:
There are no data on the developmental risks associated with use of risdiplam in 
pregnant women. In animal studies of rats and rabbits, administration of risdiplam 
resulted in adverse effects on development including embryofetal mortality, 
malformations, decreased fetal body weights, and reproductive impairment in offspring.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Women who have been exposed to risdiplam during pregnancy or 1 month prior to the 
start of pregnancy.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

932
Preventability:
The pregnancy status of female patients of reproductive potential should be verified prior 
to initiating treatment with risdiplam.
Females of reproductive age should use effective contraception during treatment with 
risdiplam and for at least 1 month after their last dose. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
Although this potential risk could result in persistent disability in infants born from 
mothers with SMA treated with risdiplam, the nonclinical data suggest that normal 
pregnancies could be possible. Normal pregnancies have been reported in patients with 
SMA who often wish to have own children (Abati et al 2018). The potential risk of 
embryofetal toxicity can therefore have a significant impact on the overall benefit-risk 
balance of risdiplam in female patients of childbearing potential wishing to conceive.
Public health impact:
No public health impact is expected. 
Effect on Epithelial Tissues 
Potential mechanisms: 
The potential effect on epithelial tissues is secondary to risdiplam’s effect on cell division 
and apoptosis associated with alternative splicing of secondary splice target genes 
(FOXM1 and MADD genes).
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
In chronic toxicology studies in rodents and monkeys, adverse effects on epithelial 
tissues (skin, larynx, eyelid, and gastrointestinal tract) were observed. These effects 
were observed within days or weeks of treatment, were dose-dependent in severity, and 
occurred with high incidence. The first clinical sign in monkeys was mild parakeratosis at 
exposures more than 2.5-fold the exposure observed at the pivotal dose selected for 
patients with SMA. These findings were reversible upon discontinuation of dosing with 
risdiplam but persisted with continuous dosing and worsened at high doses with 
breakage of the skin barrier when animals were dosed through.
Characterization of the risk:
In the ‘All Patients with SMA’ population, skin findings were either not suggestive of 
events observed in nonclinical studies (mainly parakeratosis) and/or resolved despite 
ongoing treatment, which precludes a causal association with risdiplam.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
risdiplam
56
of
932
Risk factors and risk groups:
Skin events suggestive of effects on epithelial tissues have not been observed in 
humans and, therefore, risk factors and risk groups cannot be identified in humans and 
must be extrapolated from nonclinical studies.
Significant overdoses may be considered as risk factors for effects on epithelial tissues 
based on the exposure dependency of findings in the nonclinical studies. Overdoses are 
a potential risk factor for effects on epithelial tissues.
Preventability:
The maximum amount of risdiplam dispensed by prescription can cover the needs for a
maximum treatment period of 64 days of treatment, which prevents occurrence of 
significant overdoses for prolonged periods. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
This potential risk does not occur at the recommended dose and would be reversible 
upon treatment discontinuation in the event of overdose.
Public health impact:
No public health impact is expected. 
Presentation of the Missing Information
SVII.3.2.
Information on Missing Information
Long-term safety
Evidence source:
To date, with patients monitored for up to 47 months, no long-term safety risk has been 
identified. Other than retinal toxicity, nonclinical studies do not indicate any other risk 
associated with chronic treatment with risdiplam (see SII.1.1 Delayed (Retinal) 
Toxicity).
The anticipated risk / consequence of risks associated with chronic treatment are 
currently unknown.
Safety in patients  1 month of age 
Evidence source:
Fifteen patients  1 month (30 days) have been enrolled in Study BN40703 
(RAINBOWFISH); however, there were no patients   20 days treated with the pivotal 
dose from Day 1 of the study. As such PK and safety in patients below 20 days has not 
been assessed to date and therefore safety in patients below 1 month is considered 
missing information.

Evrysdi is already approved for patients with SMA from birth in several countries 
including the U.S. Although the worldwide exposure in patients   1 month is unknown,
solicited information is available from U.S. physicians regarding 12 newborns   20 days 
of age at the time of risdiplam treatment start. The patients ranged from 1 to 18 days of 
age at first administration and were dosed according to the United States Prescribing 
Information (USPI) at 0.15 mg/kg. The physicians orally reported that treated newborns 
did well on risdiplam, progressed normally, and reached milestones on time. One 
newborn was reported with an upper respiratory tract infection assessed as unrelated to 
risdiplam by the physician. Five out of the 12 babies (~42%) discontinued risdiplam 
between 2 weeks and 4 months of age due to starting gene therapy, while all others 
remained on risdiplam treatment. 
This information is consistent with the Global Safety Database which does not provide 
evidence for adverse safety outcomes in patients starting risdiplam   1 month of age.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for EVRYSDI (RISDIPLAM)
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Evrysdi. The RMP details 
important risks of Evrysdi, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Evrysdi’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Evrysdi’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Evrysdi should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Evrysdi should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Evrysdi’s RMP.
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Evrysdi is authorized for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients
with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2
copies (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains risdiplam as the active substance,
and it is given as a solution by mouth or feeding tube.
Further information about the evaluation of Evrysdi’s benefits can be found in Evrysdi’s
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web site, under 
the medicine’s Web page:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/evrysdi
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of Evrysdi, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Evrysdi’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals.
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging.
The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly.
The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
risdiplam

of
932
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Evrysdi is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing Information” below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Evrysdi are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Evrysdi. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine, and in patients  1 month of age).

II.B Summary of Important Risks
Important Potential Risk: Embryofetal toxicity
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Consistent with its effects on cell division and apoptosis, 
treatment of pregnant rabbits with risdiplam has been 
associated with maternal toxicity and teratogenicity, with a 
NOAEL at exposures of ~4 times the mean exposure guidance 
in clinical trials. No teratogenicity was observed in rats up to 
~5 times the clinical mean exposure guidance, but embryofetal 
toxicity (reduced fetal weight and delayed fetal development) 
was noted, with a NOAEL slightly in excess of 2-fold the mean 
exposure guidance without maternal toxicity. Even though 
teratogenicity was only noted in the rabbit at a maternally toxic 
dose level, the possibility of a dysmorphogenic potential of 
risdiplam in the human cannot be discounted.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Women who have been exposed to risdiplam during pregnancy

Important Potential Risk: Effect on Epithelial tissues
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
In chronic toxicology studies in rodents and monkeys, adverse 
effects on epithelial tissues (skin, larynx, eyelid, and 
gastrointestinal tract) were observed. These effects were 
observed within days or weeks of treatment, were dose-
dependent in severity, and occurred with high incidence. The 
first clinical sign in monkeys was mild parakeratosis at 
exposures more than 2.5-fold the exposure observed at the 
pivotal dose selected for patients with SMA. These findings 
were reversible upon discontinuation of dosing with risdiplam 
but persisted with continuous dosing and worsened at high 
doses with breakage of the skin barrier when animals were 
dosed through.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Skin events suggestive of effects on epithelial tissues have not 
been observed in humans therefore risk factors and risk groups 
cannot be identified in humans and must be extrapolated from 
nonclinical studies.
Overdoses are a potential risk factor for effects on epithelial 
tissues based on findings in the nonclinical studies.

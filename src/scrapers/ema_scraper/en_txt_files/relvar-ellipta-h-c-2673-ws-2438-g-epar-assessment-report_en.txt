1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, GlaxoSmithKline (Ireland) Limited 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 8 February 2023 an application for a group of variations 
following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
The following changes were proposed:

studies to the competent authority 
Grouped application consisting of 1) Update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include results from 
study HZA107116. This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, multicentre, stratified, study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) inhalation powder 
compared to once daily FF inhalation powder in the treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 
years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids. The Package Leaflet and Labelling 
are updated accordingly. The RMP version 12.0 has also been submitted. In addition the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes to the SmPC; 2) Submission of final report from Phase 2b 
study HZA106855 (FF dose ranging) which gives information regarding the dose selection for FF 
combination in study HZA107116; 3) Submission of final report from Phase 2b study HZA106853 (VI dose 
ranging) which gives information regarding the dose selection for VI combination in study HZA107116. 
The requested grouped worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The requested grouped worksharing procedure is mainly proposing amendments to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (sections 4.2 and 5.1, to include results from study HZA107116). The Package 
Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. The WS documentation also includes an updated Risk 
Management Plan (RMP, version 12.0). In addition the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial 
changes to the SmPC. The documentation also includes the final report of the Phase 2b study HZA106855 
(FF dose ranging) and HZA106853 (VI dose ranging). These dose ranging studies were conducted to 
guide the doses of FF and VI to be used in study HZA107116. 
Study HZA107116 is the pivotal study supporting SmPC changes. It was a randomised, double-blind, 
parallel group, multicentre, stratified, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation powder in the 
treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled 
corticosteroids. Study randomisation was stratified by age as follows: participants from 5 to 11 years 
were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 50/25 micrograms OD or FF 50 micrograms whereas 
participants from 12 to 17 years were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 100/25 micrograms or FF 
100 micrograms. Study HZA107116 was designed to meet different requirements for the EMA and the 
FDA, as regards of the population of interest (5 to 11 years old for the EMA and 5 to 17 years old for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 6/72 
 
 
 
FDA) and their list of endpoints. The study design, which was based on advice received from the EMA 
SAWP and subsequently agreed with the PDCO via a modification to the PIP, is considered acceptable. 
FF/VI was well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified, which is in line with the results 
reported in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. However, the study did not show a 
statistically significant improvement in its primary efficacy endpoint of morning PEF in the 5 to 11 years 
old population.  
According to the obtained data from the phase 3 study, the MAH is not seeking an indication for FF/VI in 
asthmatics aged 5 to 11 years old in the EU. This approach is endorsed based on the results of the 
studies. However, the initially proposed changes to the product information were rather extensive and 
some of them were not directly related to this WS. As no improved efficacy was observed when compared 
with FF, the CHMP requested that section 4.2 states that the product should not be used in children less 
than 12 years of age.  The applicant amended the PI according to CHMP requests (see final product 
information attached).  
Finally, ICS/LABA combination products currently available for children include fluticasone 
propionate/salmeterol, mometasone/formoterol and budesonide/formoterol. Therefore, it could be 
concluded that these patients are covered by several treatment alternatives in the EU.. No future 
development to establish the use of RELVAR/REVINTY Ellipta in this 5-11 year old population in the EEAA 
is foreseen, according to the MAH. 
The MAH has provided an updated environmental risk assessment (ERA). Nevertheless, since the pivotal 
study HZA107116 that supports the indication extension did not reach statistical significance and an asthma 
indication extension from 12 years of age down to 5 years is not being proposed, additional ERA studies 
are  not  deemed  necessary  for  this  application.  A  summarized  table  of  the  ERA  relevant  endpoints  is 
enclosed. 
The benefit-risk balance of Relvar Ellipta, Revinty Ellipta, remains positive. 
Information on paediatric requirements  
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/202/2009 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/202/2009 was completed. The PDCO issued an 
opinion on compliance for the PIP P/202/2009.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on results from studies HZA107116, 
HZA106853 (VI dose ranging) and HZA106855 (FF dose ranging). Study HZA107116 was a randomised, 
double-blind, parallel group, multicentre, stratified, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once daily 
fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation 
powder in the treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently 
uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids. Results from the Phase 2b study HZA106855 (FF dose ranging) 
gives information on the dose selection for FF combination in study HZA107116; Results from the Phase 
2b study HZA106853 (VI dose ranging) are also provided and support the dose selection for VI 
combination in study HZA107116. 
The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly.  
In addition, minor comments are introduced to bring the PI in line with the current QRD template. 
The RMP has also been adopted (version 12.0). 
is recommended for approval. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/202/2009 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the grouped worksharing procedure, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA 
and IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
4.  EPAR changes 
The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows:

This grouped application concerns the submission of the final study reports from 3 clinical studies. The 
studies HZA106855 and HZA106853 informed the dose selection for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
combination (FFVI) in study HZA107116. The study HZA107116 was pivotal and evaluated the efficacy 
and safety of once daily treatment of FF/VI combination in children 5 to 11 years old with asthma. FF/VI 
was well tolerated and no new safety issues were identified, which is in line with the results reported in 
adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. However, the study did not show a statistically and 
clinically significant improvement in its primary efficacy endpoint of morning PEF in the 5 to 11 years old 
population. Consequently, the SmPC is updated to include results from study HZA107116 and to inform 
Assessment report

5.  Introduction 
Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs characterized by airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction and 
increased airway responsiveness. Patients with asthma typically present with cough, episodic shortness of 
breath, and wheezing, and these clinical features are seen in school aged children, adolescents, and 
adults. The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain asthma control and to reduce the future 
risk of exacerbations [GINA, 2022]. 
ICS is considered the most effective anti-inflammatory treatment for all severities of persistent asthma 
including mild intermittent asthma [NIH, 2007;Di Cicco, 2021; GINA, 2022] in children. The benefits of 
ICS include control of asthma symptoms, improvement in lung function, decrease in airway hyper-
responsiveness and possibly, prevention of airway wall remodelling and prevention of asthma 
exacerbations [Pedersen, 1997; Fanta, 2009, Jackson, 2021]. The dose of ICS is selected based on the 
severity of asthma and with the aim of minimizing the dose, to reduce the risk of steroid side effects. 
There is a ceiling effect of low-dose ICS in children [Lemanske, 2010; GINA, 2022]. To achieve 
improvements in asthma control, the addition of a different class of medication is often required. For 
patients who become symptomatic or remain symptomatic on a low-mid dose of an ICS, the addition of a 
long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA) has shown to be usually more beneficial than doubling the ICS dose 
[Lemanske, 2010]. Indeed, a LABA, in combination with an ICS, is advocated by the guidelines as 
treatment for children aged 5-11 years when a medium dose of ICS alone fails to achieve control of 
asthma [GINA, 2022]. LABAs act on the beta2-adrenergic receptor causing smooth muscle relaxation, 
which results in dilation of bronchial passages. The addition of a LABA to an ICS improves symptom 
scores, decreases nocturnal asthma symptoms, improves lung function, and reduces the number of 
asthma exacerbations [Ducharme, 2010]. ICS/LABA combination products currently available for children 
include fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, mometasone/formoterol and budesonide/formoterol. 
Non-adherence to asthma treatment is a significant risk factor for mortality, morbidity, hospitalizations, 
and reduced quality of life, while optimal adherence is associated with reduced exacerbation rates, and 
lower mortality rates [Stern, 2006]. Most ICS/LABA combination products currently available for children 
require twice-daily administration. A significant need exists in children for a once daily ICS/LABA 
combination product that will help to improve patient compliance and overall disease management by 
providing sustained 24-hour efficacy [Drouin, 2022]. 
Inhaled Fluticasone furoate (FF) powder is a glucocorticoid approved in the United States (US) on 20 
August 2014, for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients aged 12 years 
and older at a dose of 100 mcg and 200 mcg, and on 17 March 2018 for use as a once daily inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 5 to 11 years at a dose of 
50 mcg, as well as in four further countries (Arnuity Ellipta). It is also the ICS component of once daily 
ICS/Long-Acting Beta Agonist (LABA) combination inhaler (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol). Neither FF nor 
vilanterol (VI) is currently available at the UE as an individual component for oral inhalation. 
On 13th November 2013, Relvar Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol [as trifenatate] Inhalation Powder 
[FF/VI]) was approved by the European Commission (EC) as a pre-dispensed multi dose dry powder for 
oral inhalation in strengths of 100/25 micrograms and 200/25 micrograms for "the regular treatment of 
asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older where use of a combination product (long-
acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate". The combination FF/VI 100/25 
micrograms was also approved for "the symptomatic treatment of adults with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD)".  
Currently, FF/VI has been approved at the 100/25 micrograms (mcg) and 200/25 mcg doses for once 
daily treatment of asthma in adults and adolescent patients of 12 years of age and over in all EEA 
countries, the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan, as well as over 70 further countries. Furthermore, FF/VI is 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 11/72 
 
 
 
approved in the United States of America (US) (tradename Breo Ellipta) at doses of 100/25 mcg or 
200/25mcg for the treatment of asthma in adults 18 years and older. FF/VI is also approved for the 
treatment of COPD at a dose of 100/25 mcg in over 70 countries.  
In line with the EU paediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed to FF/VI for the condition asthma (Procedure 
No.: EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12), which included a waiver in children under 5 years of age, the MAH 
has conducted a single Phase 3 study to address the post-approval commitment to evaluate once daily 
treatment of FF/VI in children 5 to 11 years old with uncontrolled asthma (study HZA107116, EMA Follow 
Up Scientific Advice, 2016: Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1073/1/FU/2/2016/PED/II).  
HZA107116 was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, stratified study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) inhalation powder 
compared to once daily FF inhalation powder in the treatment of asthma in participants 5 to 17 years old 
inclusive currently uncontrolled on ICS. Study randomisation was stratified by age (5 to 11 and 12 to 17).  
Study HZA107116 was designed to meet different requirements for the EMA and the FDA. For the EMA, 
the study included participants aged 5 to 11 years old. To meet the requirements for the FDA, the study 
also included a cohort of patients aged 12 to 17 years old. Each age group in the study used different 
strengths of investigational product. The population of interest for the FDA (5 to 17 years old) had a 
different list of endpoints.  
This type II variation submission is based on study HZA107116 alone. The submitted results from the 
study are limited to the EMA population of interest (5 to 11 years old).   
For this grouped application, the MAH has also submitted final reports from two Phase 2b dose ranging 
studies (HZA106853 and HZA106855) which gives information regarding the dose selection in the 5 to 
less than 12 years age group for each of the components of combination in study HZA107116. 
HZA106853 evaluated 3 doses of VI [6.25 mcg, 12.5 mcg, 25 mcg on a background of ICS], whereas 
HZA106855 evaluated 3 doses of FF [25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg]). Both phase 2b studies are also part of 
the EU PIP No.: EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12. 
6.  Non-Clinical aspects 
6.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  has  submitted  this  type  II  variation  to  update  the  label  in  line  with  the  outcome  of  study 
HZA107116, in which the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance and therefore an asthma 
indication extension from 12 years of age down to 5 years is not being proposed. 
Only  new  data  related  to  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  for  fluticasone  furoate  and  vilanterol 
trifenatate  have  been  submitted  by  the  MAH.  No  additional  non-clinical  information  (pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics or toxicology) has been provided. 
Previously  to  the  ERA  data  currently  submitted,  an  updated  Module  1.6.1  ERA  was  submitted  to  the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 2016 to assess the potential of FF as an endocrine active substance.

6.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated Module 1.6.1 ERA was previously submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 29th 
April  2016  under  procedure  number:  EMEA/H/C/002745/WS/0957/IB/1  to  provide  the  results  of  an 
Extended Fish Early Life Stage study conducted with FF. In addition to the presentation of results of the 
extended OECD 210/OECD 234 study, the Phase I calculation was updated and further, a Phase II tailored 
risk assessment was presented on FF to evaluate its potential as an endocrine active substance. Phase I 
calculations  of  the  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  (PEC)  for  FF  and  vilanterol  trifenatate  gave 
calculated PEC values of 0.001µg/L and 0.0005 µg/L, respectively, indicating that no further evaluation of 
environmental fate and effects for these compounds is required.  
In  addition,  FF  was  considered  as  a  potential  endocrine  active  substance  and  therefore  the  potential 
endocrine activity of this compound was investigated in an appropriate chronic test system with relevant 
end  points.  GSK  has  conducted  a  fish  early  life-stage  test,  as  per  OECD  210,  as  a  range-finder  to  set 
concentrations for an extended early life-stage test, exposing newly fertilised embryos until they reached 
sexual  maturity  (OECD  234).  This  study  concluded  that  no  statistically  significant  effects  were  observed 
between the controls and any of the test concentrations in terms of hatching success, post-hatch survival, 
growth or spawning ability. The overall NOEC and LOEC values were therefore considered to be 3.2 and 
>3.2 μg/L, respectively, based on nominal concentrations and 0.58 and > 0.58 μg/L, respectively, based 
on geometric mean measured concentrations. 
According to the current Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use, an update of the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if there is an increase in the

The manufacturing forecast for all GSK registered products for the 5th year of sales up to 2027 in the EU 
+ UK has been revised in light of this submission and a worst case (i.e., stretch scenario) of an increase in 
10% drug substance volume over previous estimates has been assumed, given a total of 204.94 kg of FF.  
Therefore:  
PECSURFACEWATER [µg/L] = 204.94 x 109 / 365 x (5.14 x 108) x 200 x 10 
PECSURFACEWATER = 0.00055 µg/L 
In this estimate it has been assumed that all the drug substance taken by patients is excreted unchanged 
into the sewage treatment plant (STP). Furthermore, this calculation is based on the assumption that there 
is no removal of fluticasone furoate in the STP, thus 100% of drug substance enters the sewage treatment 
plant unchanged and passes through into the aquatic environment. In the above equation, based on the 
predicted  worst  possible  case  (i.e.,  stretch  scenario)  amount  of  FF  entering  the  environment  (204.94 
kg/year), the calculated PECSURFACEWATER would be 0.00055 µg/L. This PEC is used to inform a more realistic 
– compared with the Fpen default (dose dependent) derived PEC - evaluation of risk characterisation ratios 
(PEC/PNEC) further (see Section 5.2.5, below). As FF is currently on the EU market a total PEC has also 
being calculated for total market volumes of this API sold in the EU in 2021 (IQVIA data).  
In 2021 the total sales of FF in all medical products in the EU was 131.80 kg (IQVIA 2021). 
Therefore:  
PECSURFACEWATER [µg/L] = 131.80 x 109 / 365 x (5.14 x 108) x 200 x 10 
PECSURFACEWATER = 0.00035 µg/L 
The manufacturing forecast for all GSK registered products for the 5th year of sales up to 2027 in the EU 
+ UK has been revised for this submission giving a total of 61.79 kg of VI.  
Therefore: 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
PECSURFACEWATER [µg/L] = 61.79 x 109 / 365 x (5.14 x 108) x 200 x 10

In this estimate it has been assumed that all the drug substance taken by patients is excreted unchanged 
into the sewage treatment plant (STP). Furthermore, this calculation is based on the assumption that there 
is no removal of FF in the STP, thus 100% of drug substance enters the sewage treatment plant unchanged 
and passes through into the aquatic environment.  
In the above equation, based on the predicted worst possible case of VI entering the environment (61.79 
kg/year), the calculated PECSURFACEWATER would be 0.00017 µg/L.  
This PEC is used to inform a more realistic – compared with the Fpen default (dose dependent) derived PEC 
- evaluation of risk characterisation ratios (PEC/PNEC) further.  
As VI is currently on the EU market a total PEC has also being calculated for total market volumes of this 
API sold in the EU in 2021 (IQVIA data).  
In 2021 the total sales of VI in all medical products in the EU was 33.10 kg (IQVIA 2021).  
PECSURFACEWATER [µg/L] = 33.10 x 109 / 365 x (5.14 x 108) x 200 x 10 
PECSURFACEWATER = 0.000088 µg/L 
Fluticasone  furoate  Phase  II  Tailored  Environmental  Risk  Assessment.  PECSURFACEWATER/ 
PNECWATER 
The PNECWATER is based on the lowest NOEC result from the base set of aquatic toxicity tests. In accordance 
with  EU  Guidance,  the  PNEC  for  aquatic  organisms  is  calculated  by  applying  an  AF  of  10  to  the  values 
resulting from tests on the environmental compartment of concern.  
PNECWATER = 0.058 µg/L  
For the PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER ratio calculated using the worst case Phase I PEC value (0.001 µg/L):  
PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER = 0.001/0.058 = 0.017 
For a more realistic PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER ratio calculated using the refined CONai based on marketing 
sales (IQVIA) in 2021 (0.00035 µg/L):  
PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER = 0.00035/0.058 = 6.03E-3 
For a more realistic PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER ratio calculated using the refined CONai based on marketing 
sales forecast in 2027 (0.00055 µg/L):  
PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER = 0.00055/0.058 = 9.50E-3 
The PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER ratio is below 1, therefore further testing in the aquatic compartment will 
not be necessary and it can be concluded that the drug substance and/or its metabolites are unlikely to 
represent a risk to the aquatic environment. 
6.6.  Discussion on nonclinical aspects 
According to the current Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), an update of the evaluation of the environmental impact should 
be made if there is an increase in the environmental exposure. Therefore, in the current type II variation, 
the MAH intention was to extend the asthma indication from 12 years of age down to 5 years; therefore, 
an  updated  ERA  has  been  submitted.  Nevertheless,  the  pivotal  study  HZA107116  that  supports  the 
indication extension did not reach statistical significance and an asthma indication extension from 12 years 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 15/72 
 
 
 
 
of  age  down  to  5  years  is  not  being  proposed.  Therefore,  submitting  an  updated  ERA  is  not  deemed 
necessary. 
Relative  to  the  updated  ERA,  according  to  the  Question  n4  of  the  document  Questions  and  answers  on 
'Guideline  on 
the  environmental 
risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use' 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1), 'market research data cannot be used for the refinement of Fpen 
as  they  take  into  account  competitive  products  and  therefore  do  not  assume  treatment  of  100%  of  the 
patients in the relevant disease'. Therefore, the refinement of the Fpen and the calculated PECSURFACEWATER 
and  PECSURFACEWATER/PNECWATER  ratios  are  not  accepted,since  the  Fpen  should  have  been  refined  using 
disease prevalence data or taking the worst-case treatment regime and worst-case number of treatment 
repetitions into consideration

8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted  
Clinical study number HZA106855 titled “A dose-ranging study of fluticasone furoate (FF) 
inhalation powder in children aged 5-11 years with asthma”. 
Study HZA106855. Overview of Design 
HZA106855 was a phase IIb, multicentre, stratified, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-
group, placebo- and active-controlled study (with rescue medication)  to evaluate the dose-response, 
efficacy and safety of three doses of FF inhalation powder administered once daily (OD) in the evening 
(PM) to children aged 5 to 11 years with persistent uncontrolled asthma over a 12-week treatment 
period. 
Study HZA106855 was designed to show a statistically significant difference between FF (ICS 
monotherapy) and placebo for the endpoint of interest. 
Total duration of study participation was up to a maximum of 17 weeks: a 4-week run-in period, a 12-
week treatment period and a follow-up period. 
Subjects meeting all of the entry criteria at screening (Visit 1) entered a 4-week run-in period during 
which they continued their existing asthma medication. Baseline safety evaluations and measures of 
asthma status were completed during the run-in period. All subjects were provided with 
albuterol/salbutamol to be used as needed for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during both the 
run-in and treatment periods. A review of compliance with daily diary and run-in medication was 
performed during the run-in period (Visit 2). At randomisation (Visit 3), subjects who met the eligibility 
criteria and remained uncontrolled despite baseline therapy were stratified based on pre-screening 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use (had used ICS/had not used ICS) and randomised to one of five 
treatments for the duration of the 12-week treatment period: FF 25 OD, FF 50 OD, FF 100 OD, fluticasone 
propionate (FP) 100 twice daily (BD) or placebo. Subjects attended 4 on-treatment visits, Visits 4, 5, 6

and 7 (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, respectively). A follow-up contact was performed 1 week after completing 
study medication. 
An overview of the study design is provided in Figure 01. 
Figure 01. Schematic Diagram - Study HZA106855 
It was calculated that a total of 575 randomised subjects (115 subjects per arm) would ensure 90% 
power, assuming a difference of 12 L/min in AM PEF in the gatekeeper comparison between the average 
of the two higher FF doses (FF 100 and FF 50) and placebo or in the comparisons between any active 
dose and placebo. This assumed a standard deviation (SD) of 28 L/min and significance declared at the 
two-sided 5% level. 
Study HZA106855. Subject Population 
Inclusion criteria 
Eligible subjects for this study were male and pre-menarchial females with uncontrolled asthma, aged 
between 5 and 11 years, with at least a 6-month history of asthma and who had been receiving stable 
asthma therapy (short-acting beta2-agonist [SABA] alone, SABA with leukotriene modifying agent or 
SABA with ICS [total daily dose ≤FP 250 mcg or equivalent]) for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 
(Screening). Subjects had to have a pre-bronchodilator peak expiratory volume (PEF) of ≥60% to ≤90% 
of their best post-bronchodilator value and, in subjects able to perform the manoeuvre, demonstrate a 
≥12% reversibility of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) within approximately 10 to 40 minutes 
following 2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol. Subjects were required to 
demonstrate the ability to use the study provided inhalers under supervision of their parent/carer. 
At the end of the run-in period (Visit 3), subjects eligible for randomisatio≤≤n had to have a pre-
bronchodilator PEF of ≥60% to ≤90% of their best post-bronchodilator value, have demonstrated 
symptoms of asthma (a score of ≥1 on the daytime or nighttime asthma symptom scores) and/or daily 
use of albuterol/salbutamol on at least 3 of the last 7 consecutive days of the run-in period, have 
demonstrated compliance with daily controller run-in medication on at least 4 of the last 7 consecutive 
days of the run-in period (not applicable for subjects on SABA alone) and have demonstrated compliance

with completion of the Daily Diary reporting, defined as completion of all questions on 4 out of the last 7 
days during the run-in period. 
Exclusion criteria

asthma within 6 months prior to screening, have had evidence of concurrent respiratory disease, or have 
had any other clinically significant medical conditions. 
Subjects could not have had any changes in asthma medication since screening (Visit 1), have 
experienced an exacerbation, defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic 
corticosteroids (tablets, parental, or depot) for at least 3 days or requiring hospitalisation or emergency 
department visit for asthma between screening (Visit 1) and randomisation (Visit 3), have evidence of 
concurrent respiratory disease, have had any unresolved clinically significant laboratory results from 
screening (Visit 1), or have had other clinically significant medical conditions (including candidiasis).

Analysis Sets 
Total Population 
The Total Population comprised all subjects screened and for whom a record existed on the study 
database and was used for the tabulation of reasons for withdrawal before randomisation. 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 20/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population comprised all subjects randomised to treatment and who received at 
least one dose of study medication. Randomised subjects were assumed to have received study 
medication unless definitive evidence to the contrary existed. This constituted the primary population for 
all analyses of efficacy and safety measures (excluding urinary cortisol analyses). Outcomes were 
reported according to the randomised treatment allocation. 
Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population consisted of all subjects in the ITT Population who did not have any full 
protocol deviations. Protocol deviations were either full or partial. 
Subjects with only partial deviations were considered part of the PP Population but from the date of their 
deviation onwards, their data was excluded. The decision to exclude a subject or part of their data from 
the PP Population was made prior to breaking the blind. The primary comparisons for the primary 
endpoint were supported by the PP Population. 
Methods 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in daily pre-dose AM PEF averaged 
over the 12-week treatment period was performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
allowing for the effects due to baseline AM PEF, region, pre-screening ICS use, sex, age, and treatment 
group. In order to account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, a step-down closed  testing procedure was applied whereby inference for FF 100 versus placebo 
and for FF 50 versus placebo was dependent upon statistical significance having first been achieved for 
the average of the two higher doses versus placebo. Similarly, inference for FF 25 versus placebo was 
dependent upon statistical significance having first been achieved for both the FF 100 versus placebo and 
the FF 50 versus placebo. 
Statistical analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of change from baseline in trough FEV1, change 
from baseline in PM PEF averaged over the 12-week treatment period, change from baseline in AM and 
PM PEF at Week 12 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]), percentage of symptom-free 24-hour 
periods and percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods were performed using an ANCOVA model with 
effects due to baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group. The secondary endpoint of withdrawals 
due to lack of efficacy was analysed using Fisher’s Exact test. Statistical analysis of log transformed 24 
hour urinary cortisol excretion was performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline, 
region, actual pre-screening ICS use, sex, age and treatment group. No formal statistical hypothesis 
testing was performed for the other safety parameters. Summary statistics were provided for AEs, 
laboratory tests, severe asthma exacerbations and vital signs. 
Clinical study number HZA106853 titled “A dose-ranging study of vilanterol (VI) inhalation 
powder in children aged 5-11 years with asthma on a background of inhaled corticosteroid 
therapy”. 
Study HZA106853. Overview of Design 
HZA106853 was a phase IIb, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
(with rescue medication) study to evaluate the dose-response, efficacy and safety of three doses of VI 
inhalation powder administered once daily (OD) in the evening (PM) in children aged 5 to 11 years with 
persistent uncontrolled asthma who were symptomatic on ICS.  
Study HZA106853 was designed to show a statistically significant difference between VI (LABA 
monotherapy) and placebo for the endpoint of interest.

Total duration of study participation was up to a maximum of 9 weeks: a 4-week open-label run-in 
period, a 4-week double-blind treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up period. 
Subjects meeting all of the entry criteria at screening (Visit 1) entered a 4-week run-in period for 
completion of baseline safety evaluations and to obtain baseline measures of asthma status. Subjects 
replaced their current short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) asthma therapy 
with open-label fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice daily (FP 100 BD) for the run-in period and the 
duration of the treatment period. All subjects were provided with albuterol/salbutamol to be used as 
needed for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during both the run-in and treatment periods. A 12-
lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and a review of compliance with daily diary and run-in medication were 
performed during the run-in period (Visit 2).  
At randomisation (Visit 3), subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive 
(1:1:1:1) one of placebo OD, VI 6.25 OD, VI 12.5 OD or VI 25 OD as double-blind treatment in addition 
to continuing open-label FP 100 BD for the duration of the 4-week treatment period. Subjects attended 2 
on-treatment visits, Visits 4 and 5 (Weeks 2 and 4, respectively). Morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak 
expiratory flow (PEF) were measured daily using an electronic Peak Flow Meter issued to subjects at 
screening (Visit 1).  
A follow-up contact was performed 1 week after completing study medication.  
An overview of the study design is provided in Figure 02. 
Figure 02. Schematic Diagram - Study HZA106853 
The sample size calculation for the randomised subjects was based on the primary efficacy endpoint of PM 
PEF. The planned 460 randomised subjects (115 subjects per arm) would ensure 90% power assuming a 
difference of 12 L/min between VI and placebo in PM PEF. This assumed a standard deviation (SD) of 28 
L/min and significance declared at the two-sided 5% level.

Study HZA106853. Efficacy Analyses 
Analysis Sets 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations were defined: 
Total Population 
The Total Population comprised all subjects screened and for whom a record existed on the study 
database and was used for the tabulation of reasons for withdrawal before randomisation. 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population 
The ITT Population comprised all subjects randomised to treatment and who had received at least one 
dose of study medication. Randomised subjects were assumed to have received study medication unless 
definitive evidence to the contrary existed. This was the primary population for all analyses of efficacy 
and safety measures. 
Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population consisted of all subjects in the ITT Population who did not have any full 
protocol deviations. Protocol deviations were either full or partial. 
Subjects with only partial deviations were considered part of the PP Population but from the date of their 
deviation onwards, their data was excluded. The decision to exclude a subject or part of their data from 
the PP Population was made prior to breaking the blind. 
This population was used for confirmatory analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint only. 
Methods 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in daily pre-dose PM PEF averaged 
over the 4-week treatment period was performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
allowing for the effects due to baseline PM PEF, region, sex, age, and treatment group. In order to 
account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons for the primary efficacy endpoint, a step-down 
closed testing procedure was applied whereby inference for VI 12.5 versus placebo was dependent upon 
statistical significance having first been achieved for VI 25 versus placebo. Similarly, inference for VI 6.25 
versus placebo was dependent upon statistical significance having first been achieved for the VI 12.5 
versus placebo. 
Statistical analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints of change from baseline in trough FEV1, change 
from baseline in AM PEF over Weeks 1 to 4, change from baseline in PM and AM PEF at Week 4 (last 
observation carried forward [LOCF]), percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods and percentage of

rescue-free 24-hour periods were performed using an ANCOVA model with effects due to baseline, region, 
sex, age, and treatment group. 
Clinical study number HZA107116 titled “A randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 
multicentre, stratified, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once daily fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation 
powder in the treatment of asthma in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently 
uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids”. 
Study HZA107116. Overview of Design 
HZA107116 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily (OD) fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder 
(FF/VI) compared to once daily fluticasone furoate inhalation powder (FF) in the treatment of asthma in 
participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids. Study 
randomisation was stratified by age (5 to 11 and 12 to 17). 
Study HZA107116 was designed to show a statistically significant difference between FF/VI (ICS/LABA 
combination therapy) and FF alone (ICS monotherapy) for the endpoint(s) of interest. 
This study was conducted over a total duration of approximately 29 weeks: a 4-week open-label run-in 
period where all participants received fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 micrograms twice daily as 
momotherapy, a 24-week double-blind treatment period where participants received FF/VI or FF as 
described above, and a 1-week follow-up period. Participants received a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) 
(i.e., salbuterol/salbutamol) as needed throughout the entire study period as rescue medication for 
symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms.   
Eligible participants for randomisation aged 5 to 11 years were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 
50/25 micrograms or FF 50 micrograms whereas eligible participants from 12 to 17 years were randomly 
(1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 100/25 micrograms or FF 100 micrograms. The doses of each of the 
components of FF/VI were selected from the results of 2 Phase IIb dose ranging studies (HZA106853 for 
VI and HZA106855 for FF) in asthmatic participants aged 5 to 11 years of age (inclusive). In participants 
aged 12 to 17 years of age, FF 100 μg was selected for this study as this is the starting dose currently 
approved by the FDA for FF monotherapy in asthmatic participants aged 12 years of age and older. FF/VI 
100/25 mcg is the approved starting dose in all EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK).

Study HZA107116 was designed to meet different requirements for the EMA and the FDA. For the EMA, 
the population of interest included participants aged 5 to 11 years old. To meet the requirements for the 
FDA, the study also included a cohort of patients aged 12 to 17 years old. Each population of interest (5 
to 11 years old and 5 to 17 years old) had a different list of endpoints (see sub-section “Study 
HZA107116. Efficacy Endpoints”). 
Approximately 2900 participants, enrolled in clinical sites located worldwide, were to be screened to 
achieve a total of 870 participants to be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 giving 435 randomised participants 
per arm in the 5 to 17 years old population. There were to be 652 randomised participants who were 11 
years old or less at screening (and at least 163/652 [25%] were to be aged 5 to less than 8 years), 
giving 326 randomised participants per arm in the 5 to 11 years old population, and 218 participants in 
the 12 to 17 years old population. A 70% screening failure rate was expected. 
The sample size calculation for the 5 to 11 years old population was based on the primary efficacy 
endpoint of AM PEF and on the nominated powered secondary endpoint of change from baseline in 
rescue-free 24-hour periods. The planned 652 randomized participants allowed for up to 4% of 
participants to not contribute to the primary endpoint giving a minimum of 312 evaluable participants per 
arm. The planned sample size had 91% power for the primary endpoint of AM PEF, based on a true 
population difference of 8 L/min and significance declared at the two-sided 5% significance level. There 
was 99% power for the powered secondary endpoint of change from baseline in rescue-free 24-hour 
periods, based on a true population difference of 10% and significance declared at the two-sided 5% 
significance level. The overall power across both endpoints was 90%. 
Study HZA107116. Subject Population  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria ensured selection of participants that were representative of the intended 
population who will receive FF/VI in clinical practice.  
Inclusion criteria 
Participants were males and females, aged 5 to 17 years (inclusive), with a history of symptoms 
consistent with a diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 (-4 Wk) and a pre-
bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Visit 1 (-4 Wk) of >50% to ≤100% of

predicted normal value. Participants were required to demonstrate lung function reversibility, defined as 
an increase of ≥12% FEV1 within 15 to 40 minutes following 2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol 
aerosol (or 1 nebulised treatment with albuterol/salbutamol solution), and must have had a Childhood 
Asthma Control Test (cACT) or Asthma Control Test (ACT) score of ≤19. 
To be eligible for the study, participants were required to have been receiving stable asthma therapy 
(short-acting beta agonist [SABA] or short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) inhaler plus inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS; total daily dose ≤fluticasone propionate ([FP]) 250 mcg or equivalent) for at least 4 
weeks prior to Visit 1 (-4 Wk) and must have been able to replace their current SABA/SAMA treatment 
with salbutamol/albuterol aerosol inhaler at Visit 1 (-4 Wk) for use as needed for the duration of the 
study. Patients must have been symptomatic (i.e., remain uncontrolled) on their existing asthma 
treatment as a main inclusion criterion. Written consent had to be provided from at least 1 parent/care 
giver and an accompanying assent from the participant (where the participant was able to provide 
assent) prior to study admission. 
Exclusion criteria 
A participant was not eligible for inclusion in this study if they had a history of lifethreatening asthma. The 
participant was not eligible for inclusion if he/she had any asthma exacerbation requiring the use of oral 
steroids within 6 weeks of Visit 1 (-4 Wk), systemic or depot corticosteroids within 3 months of Visit 1 (-4 
Wk), emergency room attendance within 3 months of Visit 1 (-4 Wk) or hospitalisation within 6 months of 
Visit 1 (-4 Wk). The participant was not eligible for inclusion if he/she had a culture-documented or 
suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, not resolved within 4 weeks 
of Visit 1 (-4 Wk) and led to a change in asthma management, clinical visual evidence of oropharyngeal 
candidiasis at Visit 1 (-4 Wk), a fasting blood glucose (FBG) >100 mg/dL, BMI above 99th percentile or 
any significant abnormalities or medical condition identified at Visit 1 (-4 Wk). The participant with 
evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the 12-lead ECG was not eligible. 
Administration of other asthma leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), ketotifen, nedocromil sodium, 
orally inhaled sodium cromoglycate, SABA/SAMA combinations, and inhaled corticosteroids (except for 
fluticasone propionate [FP], which was given during the run-in) was prohibited during the study. 
Administration of theophyllines, oral or inhaled long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs), combination 
products containing inhaled LABAs, inhaled long-acting anticholinergics potent cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) inhibitors or prescription or over-the-counter medication that would significantly affect the 
course of asthma or interact with study drug were prohibited within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (-4 Wk) and 
during the study). Administration of oral corticosteroids was prohibited within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (-4 
Wk) and during the study. Administration of systemic or depot corticosteroids, anti-immunoglobulin E 
(IgE) and anti-interleukin (IL)5 immunosuppressive medications was prohibited within 12 weeks prior to 
Visit 1 (-4 Wk) and during the study (immunotherapy for the treatment of allergies was allowed during 
the study provided it was initiated at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (-4 Wk) and the participant remained 
in the maintenance phase throughout the study). 
Study HZA107116. Efficacy Endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints from the study HZA107116 presented in this report are those defined to the EMA 
population of interest (5 to 11 years old).  
Primary Endpoint 
The EMA-specific primary endpoint for the 5 to 11 years old population was:  
•  Change from baseline, averaged over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, in pre-dose (i.e., 
trough) morning peak expiratory flow (AM PEF), captured daily via electronic patient diary.

Secondary Endpoints 
The EMA-specific secondary efficacy endpoints for the 5 to 11 years old population were: 
•  Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of the 
treatment period, captured daily via electronic patient diary. This was a powered secondary 
endpoint for 5 to 11 years population. 
•  Change from baseline in the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of 
the treatment period, captured daily via electronic patient diary. 
•  Change from baseline in AM FEV1 in participants who can perform the manoeuvre at Week 12. 
•  Change from baseline in ACQ-5 at Week 24. 
•  Weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12.  
This was the primary endpoint for the population of interest for the FDA (5 to 17 years old). 
• 
Incidence of exacerbations over the 24-week treatment period. 
Other endpoint 
•  Change from baseline, averaged over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period in PM PEF, captured 
daily via electronic patient diary. 
Study HZA107116. Efficacy Analyses 
Analysis Sets 
For purposes of analysis of the EMA population of interest, the following populations were defined: 
Total Population 
The Total Population comprised all participants screened and for whom a record existed on the study 
database and was used for the tabulation and listings of reasons for withdrawal before randomization. 
ITT (5 to 11 Years Old) Population 
The ITT (5 to 11 Years Old) Population consisted of all randomized participants 11 years old or younger at 
screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) who received at least one dose of study treatment. Outcomes were reported 
according to the randomized treatment allocation. This constituted one of the 2 primary populations for 
all efficacy measures and safety measures. 
Methods 
Demonstration of efficacy was based on a hypothesis testing approach, whereby the null hypothesis was 
that there is no difference between treatment groups for the endpoint of interest and the alternative 
hypothesis was that there is a difference between treatment groups (FF/VI versus FF alone).  
A 2-sided 5% risk associated with incorrectly rejecting any of the null hypotheses (significance level) was 
considered acceptable for this study. As the comparisons on the 5 to 17 years old population and the 5 to 
11 years old population were being made for different purposes, they each had distinct multiple testing 
strategies which were assessed separately. 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 28/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to account for multiplicity across the key endpoints, a step-down closed-testing procedure was 
applied to the inequality comparison of FF/VI versus FF, whereby this comparison was required to be 
significant at the 0.05 level for the primary endpoint in order to infer on the secondary endpoints and 
inference for a test in the predefined hierarchy of secondary endpoints was dependent upon statistical 
significance having been achieved for the previous comparison in the hierarchy of secondary endpoints. If 
a given statistical test failed to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment difference at the significance 
level of 0.05, then all tests lower down in the hierarchy were interpreted as descriptive only.  
The treatment comparisons defined as part of the multiple testing strategy were limited to the specified 
key comparisons shown in Table 01. Analyses of other efficacy measures in either population for the 
FF/VI versus FF treatment comparison were nested under the secondary efficacy measures and no 
multiplicity adjustment was planned for these other efficacy endpoints. 
Table 01.

To address the primary effectiveness-type estimand, the primary analysis on the ITT (5 to11 years old) 
population included all available AM PEF data from Weeks 1 to 12, regardless of whether the participant 
had been still on-treatment at the time of the measurement. Missing data was assumed to be missing at 
random (MAR) in the primary analysis. 
To address the secondary efficacy-type estimand, the analysis was repeated using only on-treatment 
data. 
The primary endpoint of change from baseline in AM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 12 was calculated for 
each participant using only data that were from the first 84 calendar days after randomisation. 
The primary analysis as performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects due to 
baseline AM PEF, region, sex, age and treatment group. The adjusted means for each treatment and the 
estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparison were presented together with 95% CIs for 
the difference and a p-value for the treatment comparison. 
To address the secondary efficacy-type estimand, the analysis was repeated using only on-treatment 
data. 
The baseline values for the PEF, symptom and rescue-use related endpoints were derived from the last 7 
days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. The baseline value for the FEV1 
related endpoints was the Visit 2 clinic visit assessment (run-in). The baseline value for the ACQ-5 
endpoint was the Visit 3 clinic visit assessment (Day 0).

Subject Disposition and Exposure  
Study HZA106855 
The majority of subjects (71%) completed the study (Table E04). Subject withdrawal was higher in the 
placebo group (45%) than the FF treatment groups (20% to 28%) and the active control group, FP 100 
BD (25%).  
In a Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to withdrawal, withdrawals occurred slightly earlier in the study for 
subjects in the placebo and FF 100 OD groups compared with subjects in the other FF treatment groups 
and the active control group, FP 100 BD. The most common primary reason for withdrawal was lack of 
efficacy (20% overall), which was reported for a greater proportion of subjects in the placebo group 
(35%) than the FF groups (range: 14% to 19%) and the active control group, FP 100 BD (16%).

Study HZA106853 
The majority of subjects (375/456 [82%]) in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population completed the study. 
Withdrawals during the study were lower in the VI 12.5 group (14/113 [12%]) than in the placebo group 
(22/115 [19%]) and the other VI treatment groups (21/114 [18%] and 24/114 [21%] in the VI 6.25 and 
VI 25 groups, respectively); the main reason for withdrawal during the study was lack of efficacy (62/456 
[14%] overall, 16% in the placebo group compared with 11% to 15% in the VI treatment groups).

Study HZA106855. Completion rates and treatment compliance. 
For randomised subjects included in the ITT Population, mean overall compliance with the double-blind 
ELLIPTA inhaler treatment was high (101.0%) and similar for the placebo group (100.8%) and VI 
treatment groups (range: 99.0% to 102.3%) (Table 10). Mean overall compliance with the open-label 
DISKUS treatment was also high (94.7%), but lower than the ELLIPTA inhaler treatment (101.0%). 
Compliance with the DISKUS treatment was similar for the placebo group (93.9%) and the VI treatment 
groups (range: 93.3% to 95.9%) .

Study HZA107116. Completion rates and treatment compliance. 
Mean (SD) overall treatment compliance was 97.0 (8.69) and similar in both groups. The majority of the 
participants showed a treatment compliance between ≥95% to ≤105%; treatment compliance below 
80% was reported for 8 (2%) in the FF/VI group and for 16 (5%) in the FF group; treatment compliance 
>120% was reported for each 1 participant in both groups. 
Study HZA106855. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics were generally similar between treatment groups. The mean age was 8.0 years, and 39% 
of subjects were aged between 5 and 7 years. The majority of subjects were male (62%) with a slightly 
higher proportion of male subjects in the FF 25 OD treatment group and the active control group, FP 100

The majority of subjects participating in the study had a duration of asthma of 2 or more years (81% in 
total). Prior to screening and during the run-in period, a little over half of subjects (54%) were receiving 
SABA therapy with a concomitant ICS. 
Screening lung function tests showed a mean pre-bronchodilator PEF of 187.69 L/min, mean post-
bronchodilator PEF of 241.27 L/min and mean percentage of pre- to post-bronchodilator PEF of 77.91%. 
In subjects who were able to perform a technically acceptable FEV1 measurement at screening, mean 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was 1.402 L, mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 1.767 L, mean percent 
reversibility was 26.88%, mean absolute reversibility was 358.3 mL and mean pre-bronchodilator percent

Alaska Native (89/456 [20%]) and American Indian or Alaska Native (72/456 [16%]). No other racial 
group contributed more than 10% of subjects to the ITT Population. African American/African Heritage 
subjects comprised 4% of the ITT Population (18/456 subjects). There was high enrolment at Latin 
American sites (70% of subjects) and the majority of subjects were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (327/456 
[72%]).

The majority of subjects participating in the study had a duration of asthma of 2 or more years (82% in 
total). A greater proportion of subjects in the placebo group had a duration of asthma of 2 or more years 
(88%) than in the VI treatment groups (range: 80% to 81%). 
Screening lung function tests showed a mean pre-bronchodilator PEF of 179.94 L/min, mean post-
bronchodilator PEF of 233.51 L/min and mean percentage of pre- to postbronchodilator PEF of 76.93%. In

Latino (477/673 [71%]) with a mean BMI (SD) of 17.78 (2.946) kg/m2. As shown in Table E10, the 
demographic data were comparable between both groups with more male participants in the FF/VI group 
than in the FF group (214/337 [64%] versus 188/336 [56%], respectively).  
Table E10. Summary of Demographic Characteristics (ITT Population, 5 to 11 Years Old) (Study HZA107116) 
Most participants (500/673 [74%]) were White and 7% (47/673), 6% (42/673), 5% (37/673), and 7% 
(47/673) were African American/African Heritage, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Multiple 
races, respectively. The 2 treatment groups were similar with respect to race and racial combinations. 
Both groups were comparable with regard to mean [SD] duration of asthma (FF/VI 4.91 [2.840] years 
versus FF 4.36 [2.782] years). The majority of participants (517/673 [77%]) had no asthma exacerbation 
in the last 12 months. All participants never smoked. 
There was no difference between the treatment groups in the lung function parameters (FEV1 [L] and 
FEV1 percent predicted [%]) at screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, Table 30] 
and at baseline (Visit 2) (run-in).  
The mean (SD) cACT scores at screening  (-4 Wk) were similar between the treatment groups (15.7 
[2.64] for the FF/VI group and 15.6 [2.57] for the FF group). Similarly, at randomization (Visit 3) (Day

0), the cACT scores were similar between the groups (15.7 [2.63] for the FF/VI group and 15.5 [2.61] for 
the FF group). 
Study HZA106855. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For the primary comparison of the primary endpoint analysis of AM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 12, a 
statistically significant difference from placebo was observed for the average of the two higher doses of FF 
(FF 50 OD and FF 100 OD). In accordance with the planned step-down closed testing procedure, a 
statistically significant difference detected in the gatekeeper comparison of the two higher doses of FF 
allowed for statistical inference to be made for the comparisons of FF 100 OD versus placebo and FF 50 
OD versus placebo. For the primary endpoint analysis of the individual doses of FF 100 OD and FF 50 OD 
against placebo for AM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 12, statistically significant differences from placebo 
were observed for both the FF 100 OD and FF 50 OD treatment groups. Since both treatment 
comparisons of FF 100 OD versus placebo and FF 50 OD versus placebo were statistically significant, 
inference could be made on the treatment comparison of FF 25 OD versus placebo. A statistically 
significant difference from placebo was observed for the treatment comparison of FF 25 OD versus 
placebo. There was no apparent FF dose-ordering in the AM PEF treatment difference values and it was 
not possible to fit an appropriate dose-response model to the data. A statistically significant difference 
from placebo in AM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 12 was also observed for the active control group, FP 
100 BD (14.0 L/min, 95% CI: 6.7, 21.4; p<0.001). 
Table E11. Study HZA106855 Primary Efficacy Endpoint (ITT Population) 
Study HZA106853. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For the primary endpoint analysis of PM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 4, the least squares (LS) mean 
change from baseline in PM PEF was slightly greater for the VI treatment groups (range: 8.9 L/min to 
11.0 L/min) than for the placebo group (4.5 L/min)VI treatment did not show a statistically significant 
improvement compared with placebo at any of the doses investigated and no dose-response was 
apparent.

Because statistical significance was not achieved for the analysis of the primary endpoint for the 
treatment comparison of VI 25 with placebo and in accordance with the step-down closed testing 
procedure described above, no statistical inference could be made for the statistical inference will not be 
drawn for the remaining efficacy analyses. 
Study HZA107116. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in morning PEF over Weeks 1 to 12, captured daily 
via electronic patient diary. The mean (SD) change from baseline to Weeks 1 to 12 was larger for the 
FF/VI treatment (11.9 [37.63]) than for the FF treatment (8.9 [35.62]) as shown in Table E13. 
Table E13. Summary of Change from Baseline in AM PEF (L/min) Over Weeks 1 to 12 On- and Post-Treatment Data (ITT 
Population, 5 to 11 Years Old) (Study HZA107116) 
The LS means change from baseline was 12.0 (Std Err: 1.86) L/min for the FF/VI treatment and 8.8 (Std 
Err 1.86) L/min for the FF treatment (Table E14). For the primary comparison of the primary endpoint 
analysis of morning PEF (L/min) over Weeks 1 to 12 on- and post-treatment, using ANCOVA with 
covariates of baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment, the difference between treatment of 3.2 L/min 
did not reach statistical significance (p=0.228) (Table E14).

Additional statistical analysis, using the repeated measures analysis method adjusted for baseline, region, 
sex, age, treatment, week, week by baseline interaction, and week by treatment group interaction 
method, gave a treatment difference of 2.5 L/min (95% CI: -2.7,7.6) [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, 
Table 2.34], and using Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation method gave a treatment difference of 2.5 
L/min (95% CI: -2.7,7.6) [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.35]. Including only the on-treatment 
data, an ANCOVA-based statistical analysis resulted in a treatment difference of 3.1 L/min (95% CI: -2.1, 
8.3) [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.36].  
The sensitivity analysis that excluded the data from sites with data concerns was consistent with the 
primary analysis giving a treatment difference of 3.7 L/min (95% CI -1.6, 8.9) [see m5.3.5.1, 
HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.80]. 
Study HZA106855. Analyses of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints.  
Statistically significant treatment differences for all doses of FF and the active control, FP 100 BD, 
compared with placebo were also observed for the secondary endpoints of PM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 
to 12 and AM PEF at Week 12 (LOCF). In the analysis of PM PEF at Week 12 (LOCF), a statistically 
significant treatment difference was observed for FF 25 OD and FF 50 OD compared with placebo, but not 
for FF 100 OD or the active control, FP 100 BD. As with the primary endpoint, there was no apparent dose 
ordering in the secondary PEF endpoints. The analysis of change from baseline in FEV1 at Week 12 
(LOCF) included the 86% of subjects who provided Best Test Review (BTR) grade spirometry data of 
Acceptable or Borderline Acceptable at baseline and at least one Acceptable or Borderline Acceptable 
post-baseline assessment. A statistically significant treatment difference was observed for trough FEV1 at 
Week 12 (LOCF) compared with placebo for FF 25 OD, but not FF 50 OD, FF 100 OD or the active control, 
FP 100 BD. Statistically significant treatment differences from placebo in rescue-free 24-hour periods 
were observed for FF 50 OD and FF 100 OD but not FF 25 OD or the active control, FP 100 BD. Smaller 
treatment differences were observed in the analysis of symptomfree 24-hour periods, and no statistically 
significant differences from placebo were detected. Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were statistically 
significantly greater in the placebo group compared with the FF treatment groups and the active control, 
FP 100 BD, group. No dose ordering in the proportion of subjects withdrawn was observed.

Small numeric increases over placebo were also shown for the secondary PEF endpoints when PM PEF was 
analysed at the end of the treatment period (Week 4), and when AM PEF was analysed both as an 
average across Weeks 1 to 4 and at the end of the treatment period (Week 4), although, as with the 
primary endpoint, there was no apparent dose ordering in the treatment differences. The analysis of 
change from baseline in FEV1 at Week 4 (LOCF) included the 75% of subjects who provided technically 
acceptable spirometry data at baseline and at least one technically acceptable post-baseline assessment. 
Similar increases in trough FEV1 from baseline were observed for placebo (223 mL) and all VI treatments

(166 mL to 240 mL) at Week 4. For rescue-free 24-hour periods, a notable difference was observed for VI 
25 treatment compared with placebo (difference: 8.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4, 17.0) which 
equated to an LS mean increase of 0.6 rescue-free days per week. This finding was supported by notable 
differences compared with placebo in symptom-free 24-hour periods for both VI 12.5 (difference: 8.3%, 
95% CI: 1.0, 15.7) and VI 25 (difference: 9.8%, 95% CI: 2.3, 17.2) which equated to an LS mean 
increase of 0.6 and 0.7 symptom-free days per week.

Rescue-free 24-hour Periods  
The mean (SE) change from baseline percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of 
the treatment period was similar between both treatments. 
The LS means change from baseline was similar between both treatments, i.e., 27.1 (Std Err 1.75) for 
the FF/VI treatment and 25.8 (Std Err 1.75) for the FF treatment. The treatment difference observed 
using the ANCOVA with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment was: 1.3 (95% CI: -3.6, 
6.2) (Table E17).  
Consistent results were seen when using the repeated measures analysis method (1.4 [95% CI: -3.5, 
6.3]), [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.40].) and the Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation 
method (1.4 [95% CI: -3.5, 6.3], [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.41].). Also, regarding the on-
treatment data only the treatment difference observed was 1.2 (95% CI: -3.7, 6.1), ([see m5.3.5.1, 
HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.42]).  
The sensitivity analysis that excluded the data from sites with data concerns was consistent with the 
primary analysis giving a treatment difference of 1.5 (95% CI: -3.5, 6.4) ([see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 
CSR, Table 2.81]). 
Symptom-free 24-hour Periods  
The mean (SE) change from baseline percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of 
the treatment period was similar between both treatments.  
The treatment difference observed using the ANCOVA with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age, and 
treatment was 1.3% (95% CI: -3.6, 6.3). See Table E17. 
AM FEV1  
At Visit 4 (Week 4), the difference between FF/VI treatment and FF treatment, using the repeated 
measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, visit, visitby-baseline interaction 
and visit-by-treatment group interaction, was 0.060 L (95% CI: [0.020, 0.099]). At Visit 5 (Week 8), the 
difference between treatments using the repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, 
age, treatment, visit, visit-by-baseline interaction, and visit-by-treatment group interaction, decreased to 
0.037 L (95% CI: (-0.010, 0.084). At Visit 6 (Week 12), the difference between treatments using the 
repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, visit, visit-by-baseline 
interaction and visit-by-treatment group interaction, was 0.028 L (95% CI: -0.017, 0.073) (Table E17). 
ACQ-5  
At Visit 6 (Week 12) and Visit 9 (Week 24), the changes from baseline were slightly larger for the FF/VI 
treatment than for the FF treatment. The treatment difference at Visit 9 (Week 24), using the repeated 
measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, visit, visit-by-baseline interaction, 
and visit-bytreatment interaction analysis method, was -0.02 (95% CI: -0.13, 0.09) (Table E17). 
Weighted mean FEV1 (0-4 hours)  
The individual serial FEV1 assessments at pre-dose and from 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose at Week 12 on-
treatment were also analyzed based on their planned time in order to visually represent the changes over 
the first 4 hours post-dose for each treatment.

Using the ANCOVA method for statistical analysis of weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12 on- 
and post-treatment, with covariates of baseline, region, sex, age and treatment, a treatment difference of 
0.073 L (95% CI: 0.028, 0.118) was observed (Table E17). 
PM PEF  
The change from baseline of the PM PEF, measured every evening over Week 1 to 12, was larger in the 
FF/VI treatment than in the FF treatment. The LS mean change (Std Err) was 13.7 (1.80) L/min for the 
FF/VI treatment and 8.1 (1.80) L/min for the FF treatment. The ANCOVA-based statistical analysis with 
covariates of baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment showed a treatment difference of 5.6 L/min (95% 
CI: 0.6, 10.6) (Table E17). 
Additional statistical analysis using the repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline, region, sex, 
age, treatment, week, week by baseline method, and Jump to Reference Multiple Imputation method 
were consistent with the main analysis [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 CSR, Table 2.60 and Table 2.61,

Exacerbations  
Any asthma exacerbation was reported for 27/337 (8%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 32/336 
(10%) participants of the FF group on- and post-treatment. Most of these participants in both groups 
experienced 1 asthma exacerbation in total. Two asthma exacerbations were reported for 2/337 (<1%) 
participants in the FF/VI group and for 5/336 (1%) participants in the FF group. None of the participants 
in either group experienced more than 2 asthma exacerbations on- and post-treatment.  
In the FF group only, 1/336 participant permanently discontinued the study intervention due to an 
asthma exacerbation.  
All participants in both treatment groups who had an asthma exacerbation received treatment with 
systemic or oral corticosteroids. One participant in the FF/VI group and 2 (<1%) participants in the FF 
group were hospitalized, and none were intubated due to an asthma exacerbation. Three participants in 
the FF/VI group and one in the FF group were reported as visiting the emergency room due to their 
asthma exacerbation.

This grouped variation application intends to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC with available 
paediatric data based on final results from the study number HZA107116. This study addresses the EU 
PIP [EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12; PIP clinical study 12] requirement to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of once daily treatment of FF/VI combination in children 5 to 11 years old with asthma. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to submit the final reports from the phase 2b study HZA106855 (dose ranging 
of FF alone) and the phase 2b study HZA106853 (dose ranging of VI alone) which give information 
regarding the dose selection for FF and VI combination in study HZA107116, based on the obtained dose-
responses. Both dose-ranging studies are also included in PIP No EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12 (PIP 
clinical study 8 for HZA106855 and PIP clinical study 10 for HZA106853). 
HZA106855 was a phase IIb, multicentre, stratified, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-
group, placebo- and active-controlled study (with rescue medication) to evaluate the dose-response, 
efficacy and safety of three doses of FF (25 OD, FF 50 OD, FF 100 OD) inhalation powder administered 
once daily (OD) in the evening (PM) to children aged 5 to 11 years with persistent uncontrolled asthma 
over a 12-week treatment period. Two control arms (fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 twice daily (BD) or 
placebo) were included. All subjects were provided with albuterol/salbutamol to be used as needed for 
symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during both the run-in and treatment periods. A total of 596 
subjects were randomised into the study, of which 593 subjects took at least one dose of study 
medication (ITT Population: 119 participants in the placebo group, 118 participants in the FF 25 OD 
group, 120 participants in the FF OD group, 118 participants in the FF 100 OD group and 118 participants 
in the FP 100 BD group). Obtained sample size (at least 115 subjects per arm) is considered enough to 
ensure 90% power and a significance declared at the two-sided 5% level. Clinically and statistically 
significant improvements were observed compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (change 
from baseline in daily pre-dose AM PEF averaged over the 12-week treatment period) for all three doses 
of FF (FF 25 OD, FF 50 OD and FF 100 OD). However no dose-response was observed in change from 
baseline in AM PEF with the three doses of FF investigated in this study. As regards of the secondary 
efficacy endpoints, small improvements were also seen for all three doses of FF versus placebo for change 
from baseline in trough FEV1 although the difference versus placebo only reached statistically significance 
for the FF 25 OD dose. Statistically significant improvements over placebo were observed for FF 50 OD 
and FF 100 OD in the percentage of rescue-free periods, although little treatment difference was 
observed in the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour periods, or the patient reported health outcomes 
questionnaires (cACT and PAQLQ(S)). The study design is considered acceptable. However, the study 
failed to show a dose response. Taking the totality of the efficacy and safety data into consideration, the 
applicant selected the FF 50 microgram dose (half of the dose used in adults and adolescents) for the 
phase 3 study performed in asthmatic participants from 5 to 11 years. 
HZA106853 was a phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
(with rescue medication) study to evaluate the dose-response, efficacy and safety of three doses of VI 
inhalation powder (VI 6.25 OD, VI 12.5 OD or VI 25 OD) administered in the evening versus placebo in 
addition to continuing open-label FP 100 BD, and a 1-week follow-up period, in children aged 5 to 11 
years with persistent uncontrolled asthma who were symptomatic on ICS. Total duration of study 
participation was up to a maximum of 9 weeks: a 4-week open-label run-in period where subjects 
replaced their current short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) asthma therapy 
with open-label fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice daily (FP 100 BD), a 4-week double-blind treatment 
period where subjects were randomly (1:1:1:1) assigned to receive one of the VI doses or placebo OD. 
All subjects were provided with albuterol/salbutamol to be used as needed for symptomatic relief of 
asthma symptoms during both the run-in and treatment periods. A total of 463 subjects were randomised 
into the study, of which 456 subjects took at least one dose of study medication (ITT Population: 115 
participants in the placebo group, 114 participants in the VI 6.25 group, 113 participants in the VI 12.5 
group and 114 participants in the VI 25 group). Obtained sample size is considered slightly minor than 
that planned (at least 115 subjects per arm) to ensure 90% power and a significance declared at the two-

sided 5% level. For the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in daily pre-dose PM PEF 
averaged over the 4-week treatment period), all treatment groups showed an increase from baseline in 
least squares (LS) mean PM PEF averaged over Weeks 1 to 4 (placebo: 4.5 L/min; VI treatment: 8.9 to 
11.0 L/min). VI treatment did not show a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo at 
any of the doses investigated (6.25, 12.5 and 25 mcg) and no dose-response was apparent. In 
accordance with the established step-down closed testing procedure, statistical inference will not be 
drawn for the remaining efficacy analyses because statistical significance was not achieved for the 
analysis of the primary endpoint for the treatment comparison of VI 25 with placebo. Nevertheless, 
notable improvements over placebo were seen for VI 25 treatment in the percentage of rescue-free and 
symptom-free 24-hour periods, although little treatment difference was observed in the patient reported 
health outcomes questionnaire (cACT) in the overall ITT Population. The study design is considered 
acceptable. However, the study failed to show a dose response. Taking the totality of the efficacy and 
safety data into consideration, the applicant selected the VI 25 microgram dose (half of the dose used in 
adults and adolescents) for the phase 3 study performed in asthmatic participants from 5 to 11 years. 
HZA107116 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, multicentre study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of once daily (OD) FF/VI compared to OD FF in the treatment of asthma 
in participants aged 5 to 17 years old (inclusive) currently uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids. Study 
randomisation was stratified by age as follows: participants from 5 to 11 years were randomly (1:1) 
allocated to receive FF/VI 50/25 micrograms or FF 50 micrograms whereas participants from 12 to 17 
years were randomly (1:1) allocated to receive FF/VI 100/25 micrograms or FF 100 micrograms. This 
study was conducted over a total duration of approximately 29 weeks: a 4- week open-label run-in period 
where all participants received fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 micrograms twice daily, a 24-week 
double-blind treatment period where participants received FF/VI or FF as described above, and a 1-week 
follow-up period. Participants received a short-acting beta agonist (SABA; i.e. albuterol/salbutamol) as 
needed throughout the entire study period as rescue medication for symptomatic relief of asthma 
symptoms. Study HZA107116 was designed to meet different requirements for the EMA and the FDA, as 
regards of the population of interest (5 to 11 years old for the EMA and 5 to 17 years old for the FDA) 
and their list of endpoints. The study design, which was based on advice received from the EMA SAWP 
and subsequently agreed with the PDCO via a modification to the PIP, is considered acceptable for a 
phase 3 study intended to show a statistically significant difference between FF/VI and FF alone (at the 
same dose [50 mcg] than that used in the combination [50/25 mcg]), thereby demonstrating the 
contribution of VI.  
HZA107116 primary objective was to compare the efficacy of OD FF/VI with OD FF in participants with 
asthma, being the secondary objective the safety assessment of OD FF/VI. In this application, the 
primary endpoint for the 5 to 11 years population (required by EMA) was change from baseline, averaged 
over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, in pre-dose (i.e., trough) morning peak expiratory flow (AM 
PEF), captured daily via electronic patient diary (eDiary). Weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) at Week 12 
was a secondary endpoint for the 5 to 11 years population, and the primary endpoint for the 5 to 17 
years population required by the FDA for the 5 to 17 years population. The primary endpoint selection is 
considered acceptable for a phase 3 study performed in asthmatic participants from 5 to 11 years. 
Although spirometry (FEV1) is considered a robust objective test to assess the severity of asthma in 
adults and children [Gaillard, 2021], using PEF instead of FEV1 in younger children could be more 
feasible, as it is a less burdensome technique.  
Efficacy secondary endpoints to 5 to 11 years population also included change from baseline in: rescue-
free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period (the powered secondary endpoint for 5 
to 11 years population), symptom-free 24-hour periods over Weeks 1 to 12 of the treatment period, AM 
FEV1 at Week 12, ACQ-5 at Week 24, and incidence of exacerbations over the 24-week treatment period. 
Secondary safety endpoints common to both 5 to 11- and 5 to 17 years population included incidence of 
Assessment report

AEs, evaluation of fasting blood glucose pre- and post-treatment, evaluation of ECG at screening and end 
of treatment. To account for multiplicity across key endpoints, a step-down closed-testing procedure was 
applied whereby inference for a test in the pre-defined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical 
significance having been achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy. The submitted study methodology 
appears adequate for its primary objective (required by the EMA). Proposed secondary efficacy and safety 
endpoints appear to be relevant to develop a medicinal product for the treatment of asthma in paediatric 
subjects from 5 years of age and older.  
A total of 2402 participants were screened, of whom 1187/2402 (49%) participants failed screening and 
309/2402 (13%) participants failed in the run-in period. Of all 906 participants randomised, a total of 902 
participants were randomised and received study intervention (454 in the FF/VI group and 448 in the FF 
group) with 673/906 (74%) participants included into the ITT population of the 5 to 11 years old (337 
participants in the FF/VI group and 336 participants in the FF group). The number of screened and 
randomised subjects as well as the number of subjects per treatment arm, are in agreement with the 
planned sample size (326 randomised participants per arm). 
The majority of the participants included into the ITT population of the 5 to 11 years old were between 8 
and 11 years old (471/673 [70%]) (mean age 8.6 [1.84] years), male (402/673 [60%]), not Hispanic or 
Latino (477/673 [71%]) with a mean BMI (SD) of 17.78 (2.946) kg/m2. The demographic and baseline 
data with respect to age, race, ethnicity, medical conditions, asthma history, and lung function were 
comparable between both groups, with more male participants in the FF/VI group than in the FF group 
(214/337 [64%] versus 188/336 [56%], respectively). Participants in this study appear to be 
representative of the intended population who would receive FF/VI in clinical practice.  
At baseline, mean AM PEF was 209.3 in the FF/VI 50/25 microgram experimental group and 206.1 in the 
FF 50 microgram control group. Mean change (SE) in the primary endpoint of AM PEF (L/min) at week 12 
was 12 (1.86) L/min in the FF/VI 50/25 vs. 8.8 (1.86) L/min in the FF 50 microgram control group 
(Difference: 3.2; 95%CI: -2.0 to 8.4; p = 0.228). Therefore, the study failed to achieve its primary 
objective. There no significant differences between treatments for the secondary endpoints of change 
from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods, the percentage of symptom-free 24-hour 
periods, change from baseline in morning FEV1, change from baseline in ACQ-5 score, weighted mean 
FEVI, and change from baseline in evening PEF. Numerical trends in favour of FF/VI were seen for the 
endpoints of weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) and change from baseline in evening PEF. Any asthma 
exacerbation was reported for 27/337 (8%) participants in the FF/VI group and for 32/336 (10%) 
participants of the FF group on- and post-treatment.  
ICS/LABA combination products currently available for children include fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, 
mometasone/formoterol and budesonide/formoterol. Therefore, it could be concluded that these patients 
are covered by several treatment alternatives in the EU. In addition, neither the FF 50 microgram nor VI 
25 microgram monocomponents are currently available for children of less than 12 years in the EU. 
Therefore, the lack of the FF/VI combination for these children will not pose a major concern.  
In summary, the performed phase 2b studies (HZA106853 and HZA106855) failed to show a dose-
response for the FF and VI doses tested. The applicant selected the FF 50 microgram and VI 25 
microgram OD dose for the pivotal study taking the totality of the efficacy and safety data into 
consideration. The pivotal study HZA107116 failed to accomplish its primary objective as no significant 
difference between FF/VI 50/25 micrograms and FF 50 micrograms in the 5 to 11 years old population for 
AM PEF was demonstrated. The majority of secondary endpoints also showed no meaningful differences 
between FF/VI  50/25 micrograms OD and FF 50 micrograms OD in the 5 to 11 years population.

9.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Safety Analyses 
Study HZA106855 
Safety and tolerability endpoints in study HZA106855 included 24-hour cortisol excretion at baseline (Visit 
3) and Week 12 (Visit 7), laboratory assessments at screening (Visit 1) and Week 12 (Visit 7) or Early 
Withdrawal, the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations during the 12-week treatment period, vital 
signs (including pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), and the incidence of adverse events 
(AEs) during the 12-week treatment period. 
Statistical analysis of log transformed 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion was performed using an ANCOVA 
model with effects due to baseline, region, actual pre-screening ICS use, sex, age and treatment group. 
No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed for the other safety parameters. Summary 
statistics were provided for AEs, laboratory tests, severe asthma exacerbations and vital signs. 
Study HZA106853  
Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring, the incidence of asthma 
exacerbations, vital signs, ECG and laboratory assessments throughout the 4-week treatment period. 
Vital signs, 12-lead ECG parameters (QT interval using Fridericia’s correction [QTc(F)] and ECG heart 
rate) and change from baseline in potassium and glucose values were analysed using an ANCOVA model 
allowing for the effects due to baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group. No formal statistical 
hypothesis testing was performed for the other safety parameters. Summary statistics were provided for 
AEs, laboratory tests, severe asthma exacerbations, vital signs and 12-lead ECGs. 
Study HZA107116 
The safety assessments in study HZA107116 included the monitoring of AEs, clinical laboratory tests 
(including fasting blood glucose), ECGs, and oropharyngeal examinations. 
AESIs for FF and/or VI in study HZA107116 were prespecified. These categories included known class 
effects associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs. The prespecified special interest 
terms for the study were: adrenal suppression, asthma/bronchospasm, cardiovascular effects, decreased 
bone mineral density and associated fractures, effects on glucose, effects on potassium, growth 
retardation in children, hypersensitivity, infective pneumonia, LRTI excluding infective pneumonia, local 
steroid effects, ocular effects, and tremor.  
In study HZA107116, asthma exacerbations were an efficacy endpoint and were defined as deterioration 
of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 
days or a single depot corticosteroid injection or an in-patient hospitalization or emergency department 
visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Asthma exacerbations were also recorded as 
AESIs and/or SAEs, when those criteria were met. 
For the safety endpoints (ECG and glucose), the baseline was taken from the screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) 
assessments.

of interest (5 to 11 years old).  
9.2.  Results 
Extent of Exposure  
Study HZA106855 
The planned duration of treatment was 12 weeks (84 days). Median exposure was similar across all 
treatment groups (range: 83.0 to 85.0 days for both ELLIPTA and DISKUS), although due to the 
differences in the incidence of early withdrawal between the treatment groups, a greater proportion of 
subjects had an exposure of 56 days or less in the placebo group (34% and 32% for ELLIPTA and 
DISKUS, respectively) and the FF 100 OD group (24% and 22% for ELLIPTA and DISKUS, respectively) 
than in the other treatment groups (range: 14% to 18% for ELLIPTA and 13% to 17% for DISKUS) 
(Table S01). 
Table S01. Summary of Exposure (Study HZA106855, ITT Population) 
Study HZA106853 
The planned duration of treatment was 4 weeks (28 days). The mean duration of treatment was similar 
across the treatment groups and the median duration of exposure for each treatment was 29 days (Table 
S02).

In study HZA107116, exposure and study duration were comparable between both groups as shown in 
Table S03. The mean (SD) number of exposure days was 165.3 (20.22) days for the FF/VI group and 
164.0 (22.98) days for the FF groups. The majority of the participants had a range of exposure of 141 to 
168 days.

Adverse Events 
Study HZA106855 
The overall incidence of subjects experiencing AEs during treatment was slightly higher in the FF 
treatment groups (range: 32% to 36%) than in the placebo group (29%), but there was no apparent 
dose-ordering between treatment groups. 
Table S04. Overview of Adverse Events Study HZA106855 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
Drug-related AEs were reported by few subjects (2 subjects, 2%, in the placebo group, 1 subject, <1%, 
in the FF 25 OD group and 1 subject, <1%, in the FF 100 OD group). All drug-related AEs were of mild or 
moderate intensity; two drug-related AEs (cough in one subject in the placebo group and stomatitis in 
one subject in the FF 100 OD group) led to withdrawal from the study. No drug-related serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were reported. 
Most Common Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported AEs during the treatment period were cough, nasopharyngitis and 
rhinorrhoea. AEs were reported for 31% of subjects in the active control group, FP 100 BD. 
Four subjects (<1%) experienced post-treatment AEs: 2 subjects (2%) in the placebo group (bronchitis 
and pharyngotonsillitis), 1 subject (<1%) in the FF 25 OD group (nasopharyngitis) and one subject 
(<1%) in the FF 50 OD group (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increased). None of the events were 
considered related to study treatment by the investigator. There were no post-treatment SAEs reported.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
Seven subjects experienced AEs or SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study: 3 subjects in the FF 100 
OD group (seasonal allergy/nasopharyngitis, stomatitis, and hepatitis A), 2 subjects in the placebo group 
(nasopharyngitis and cough/dyspnoea), and one subject in each of the FF 50 OD group (syncope) and the 
active control group, FP 100 BD (upper respiratory tract infection). 
Serious Adverse Events 
No pre-treatment SAEs were reported. 
Two on-treatment non-fatal SAEs were reported, syncope for a subject in the FF 50 OD group and 
hepatitis A for a subject in the FF 100 OD group. Neither SAE was considered related to study treatment. 
There were no fatal SAEs reported during the study. 
Deaths 
No subjects died during the conduct of this study. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Few on-treatment and post-treatment AEs of special interest related to the known pharmacological 
effects of ICS treatment (hypersensitivity, effects on glucose, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection 
[excl. pneumonia], decreased bone mineral density and associated fractures, adrenal suppression, 
corticosteroid associated eye disorders, local steroid effects, and growth retardation in children) were 
reported during the study. Cough was the most commonly reported AE of special interest (6 subjects, 
5%, in the placebo group, between 1 subject, <1%, and 10 subjects, 8% in the FF treatment groups, and 
5 subjects, 4%, in the active control, FP 100 BD, group), followed by nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhoea and 
pharyngitis. AEs of special interest considered related to study treatment in the opinion of the 
investigator were reported for 2 subjects: cough (with concurrent unrelated dyspnoea) for one subject in 
the placebo group which resulted in withdrawal from the study and cough in one subject in the FF 25 OD 
group. No asthma related hospitalisations, intubations or deaths were reported during the study.

The overall incidence of subjects experiencing AEs during treatment was higher in the VI treatment 
groups (range: 28% to 33%) than in the placebo group (22%), but there was no apparent dose-ordering 
between treatment groups (Table S06). 
Table S06. Overview of Adverse Events (Study HZA106853, ITT Population) 
Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
Five subjects (1%) experienced seven AEs considered to be related to study treatment in the opinion of 
the investigator: 3 subjects (3%) in the VI 6.25 treatment group (oral candidiasis in 2 subjects and 
headache in 1 subject) and 2 subjects (2%) in the VI 12.5 treatment group (abdominal pain, arthralgia 
and lip oedema in one subject and epistaxis in a second subject). No drug-related serious adverse events 
(SAEs) were reported. 
Most Common Adverse Events 
The proportion of subjects reporting one or more of the on-treatment AE which occurred at an incidence 
of ≥3% in the ITT Population was higher in the VI treatment groups (range: 16% to 24%) than the 
placebo group (13%), although the proportion of subjects reporting individual PTs was broadly similar 
between groups and there was no apparent dose-ordering in the reporting frequency. The most 
frequently reported AEs during the treatment period were nasopharyngitis, headache and rhinitis. 
Post-treatment AEs were reported for 6 subjects (1%), 3 subjects (3%) in the placebo group, 1 subject 
(<1%) in the VI 6.25 group and 2 subjects (2%) in the VI 12.5 group. 
No post-treatment AEs were considered related to study treatment by the investigator.

Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
Only one SAE was reported, appendicitis in a subject in the VI 25 treatment group, which was considered 
unrelated to study treatment by the Investigator and led to withdrawal from the study. One other AE

leading to withdrawal, viral respiratory tract infection, occurred in a subject in VI 6.25 treatment group, 
and was not considered related to study treatment. 
Serious Adverse Events 
No pre-treatment SAEs were reported. One on-treatment non-fatal SAE of appendicitis was reported for a 
subject in the VI 25 treatment group. This SAE was not considered related to study treatment. 
No other on-treatment non-fatal SAEs were reported.

Few on-treatment and post-treatment AEs of special interest related to the known pharmacological 
effects of long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) treatment (cardiovascular effects, effects on glucose and 
potassium, tremor, asthma related intubations and deaths, and hypersensitivity reactions) were reported 
during the study. 
In the summary of AEs of special interest identified using standardised medical dictionary for regulatory 
activities (MedDRA) queries (SMQs), two subjects were reported with allergic bronchitis, one subject in 
the placebo group and one subject in the VI 12.5 treatment group. Where no suitable SMQs were 
available and Sponsor defined special interest terms were used, AEs of special interest were reported for 
a total of 12 subjects. The most frequently reported event was cough (2 subjects in the VI 6.25 treatment 
group and one subject in each of the VI 12.5 and VI 25 treatment groups). Lip oedema, in one subject in 
the VI 12.5 treatment group, was the only AE of special interest considered related to study treatment in 
the opinion of the investigator. No asthma related hospitalisations, intubations or deaths were reported. 
Study HZA107116 
Overall, 131/337 (39%) participants in the FF/VI group and 121/336 (36%) participants in the FF group 
experienced at least 1 AE (Table S08).

Treatment-Related Adverse Events 
In 4/337 (1%) participants in the FF/VI group and 4/336 (1%) participants in the FF group experienced 
at least 1 AE, which was considered by the investigator to be drug-related (Table S08). 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023

The majority of the drug-related AEs occurring were reported at maximum for 1 participant per group, 
only dysphonia was reported for 2/336 (<1%) participants in the FF group. 
Adrenergic stimulation was not an AESI in this study but is a known effect of LABAs. In the drug-related 
AEs, there were no trends in the FF/VI group versus the FF group suggesting participants in the FF/VI 
group had signs or symptoms of adrenergic stimulation. 
Most Common Adverse Events by Preferred Term 
In the FF/VI group the most commonly reported on-treatment AEs were nasopharyngitis in 37/337 (11%) 
participants, upper respiratory tract infection in 23/337 (7%) participants, allergic rhinitis in 14/337 (4%) 
participants, headache in 9/337 (3%) participants, and rhinitis in 11/337 (3%) participants (Table 3). 
In the FF group the number of participants were smaller regarding all of the most commonly reported AEs 
than in the FF/VI group. Nasopharyngitis was reported in 27/336 (8%) participants, upper respiratory 
tract infection in 18/336 (5%) participants, allergic rhinitis in 4/336 (1%) participants, headache in 8/336 
(2%) participants, and rhinitis in 4/336 (1%) participants. 
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
The number of participants with AEs leading to permanent discontinuation is very small in both groups 
(Table S08). For 2/337 (<1%) participants in the FF/VI group, the AEs of intestinal obstruction and of 
insomnia led to permanent discontinuation, and for 1 participant in the FF group the AE of dysphonia led 
to discontinuation. 
Fot the FF/VI group, the participant with the AE of intestinal obstruction was a female, Black or Afro-
American 5-year-old participant (Participant ID: HZA107116/001522). The AE started 34 days after 
dosing and was resolved 13 days later. The investigator considered the intensity to be severe and the AE 
not to be drug-related. The AE occurred on-treatment. The participant with the AE of insomnia was a 
male, White 10-year-old participant (Participant ID: HZA107116/008009). The AE started 60 days after 
dosing and was resolved 11 days later. The investigator considered the intensity to be moderate and the 
AE not to be drug-related. The AE occurred on-treatment. 
For the FF group, the participant with the AE of dysphonia was a male, White 7-year-old participant 
(Participant ID: HZA107116/008507). The AE started 115 days after dosing and was resolved 6 days 
later. The investigator considered the intensity to be mild and the AE to be drug-related. The AE occurred 
on-treatment. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The number of participants experiencing a SAE was similar in each treatment group (Table 5). Overall, at 
least 1 SAE was reported for 4/337 participants in the FF/VI group and 4/336 participants in the FF 
group. None of the SAEs occurring were considered by the investigator to be drug-related [see m5.3.5.1, 
HZA107116 CSR, Listing 17]. 
In both groups, at least 1 SAE was reported for 4 (1%) participants in each group. No drug-related SAE, 
no fatal AE and no drug-related fatal AE were reported. 
One of the SAEs, an intestinal obstruction, caused the participant (FF/VI treatment group) to discontinue 
study treatment and this event is summarized in Section 2.1.4. The following are brief summaries of the 
other 7 SAEs: 
• In the FF/VI 50/25 mcg once daily group, a 10-year-old White male had a SAE of gastroenteritis 
rotavirus 125 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity was severe and the 
participant recovered after 30 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 56/72 
 
 
 
• In the FF/VI 50/25 mcg once daily group, a 7-year-old male (multiple races), had a SAE of appendicitis 
169 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity was severe and the participant 
recovered after 6 days. 
• In the FF/VI 50/25 mcg once daily group, an 8-year-old White male had a SAE of asthma (verbatim 
text: asthma exacerbation) with onset 20 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum 
intensity was severe and the event resolved after 10 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, an 8-year-old White female had a SAE of asthma (verbatim text: 
asthma exacerbation) with onset 86 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity 
was severe and the event resolved after 34 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, a 11-year-old White male had a SAE of helicobacter gastritis with 
onset 52 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity was severe and the event 
resolved after 10 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, a 7-year-old White female had a SAE of asthma (verbatim text: 
asthma exacerbation) with onset 58 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity 
was severe and the event resolved after 5 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, a 5-year-old Black or African American male had a SAE of asthma 
(verbatim text: asthma exacerbation) with onset 21 days after the first dose of study treatment. The 
maximum intensity was severe and the event resolved after 5 days. 
No drug-related SAE was reported.  
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during the study (Table SXX). 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The number of participants experiencing a SAE was similar in each treatment group (Table 5). Overall, 
4/337 participants in the FF/VI group and 4/336 participants in the FF group experienced a SAE. None of 
the SAEs occurring were considered by the investigator to be drug-related [see m5.3.5.1, HZA107116 
CSR, Listing 17]. 
One of the SAEs, an intestinal obstruction, caused the participant (FF/VI treatment group) to discontinue 
study treatment and this event is summarized in Section 2.1.4. The following are brief summaries of the 
other 7 SAEs: 
• In the FF/VI 50/25 mcg once daily group, a 10-year-old White male had a SAE of gastroenteritis 
rotavirus 125 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity was severe and the 
participant recovered after 30 days. 
• In the FF/VI 50/25 mcg once daily group, a 7-year-old male (multiple races), had a SAE of appendicitis 
169 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity was severe and the participant 
recovered after 6 days. 
• In the FF/VI 50/25 mcg once daily group, an 8-year-old White male had a SAE of asthma (verbatim 
text: asthma exacerbation) with onset 20 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum 
intensity was severe and the event resolved after 10 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, an 8-year-old White female had a SAE of asthma (verbatim text: 
asthma exacerbation) with onset 86 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity 
was severe and the event resolved after 34 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 57/72 
 
 
 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, a 11-year-old White male had a SAE of helicobacter gastritis with 
onset 52 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity was severe and the event 
resolved after 10 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, a 7-year-old White female had a SAE of asthma (verbatim text: 
asthma exacerbation) with onset 58 days after the first dose of study treatment. The maximum intensity 
was severe and the event resolved after 5 days. 
• In the FF 50 mcg once daily group, a 5-year-old Black or African American male had a SAE of asthma 
(verbatim text: asthma exacerbation) with onset 21 days after the first dose of study treatment. The 
maximum intensity was severe and the event resolved after 5 days. 
FF/VI Group 
The participant with the AE of intestinal obstruction was a female, Black or Afro-American 5-year-old 
participant (Participant ID: HZA107116/001522). The AE started 34 days after dosing and was resolved 
13 days later. The investigator considered the intensity to be severe and the AE not to be drug-related. 
The AE occurred on-treatment. 
The participant with the AE of insomnia was a male, White 10-year-old participant (Participant ID: 
HZA107116/008009). The AE started 60 days after dosing and was resolved 11 days later. The 
investigator considered the intensity to be moderate and the AE not to be drug-related. The AE occurred 
on-treatment. 
FF Group 
The participant with the AE of dysphonia was a male, White 7-year-old participant (Participant ID: 
HZA107116/008507). The AE started 115 days after dosing and was resolved 6 days later. The 
investigator considered the intensity to be mild and the AE to be drug-related. The AE occurred on-
treatment. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Slightly more participants (31/337 [9%] participants) in the FF/VI group experienced at least 1 AESI than 
in the FF group (27/336 [8%]). The majority of AESIs reported were similar in type and frequency in both 
groups, with the exception of hypersensitivity events (FF/VI: 18/336 [5%] participants versus 9/336 
[3%] participants in the FF group). This difference was driven by AEs of rhinitis allergic in the FF/VI group 
that were assessed as not drug-related. 
There were no events reported for the following AESIs: adrenal suppression, effects on potassium, growth 
retardation in children, ocular effects, or tremor.  
Asthma Exacerbations 
Study HZA106855 
Twelve subjects experienced asthma exacerbations during the treatment period (7 subjects, 6%, in the 
placebo group, 2 subjects, 2%, in each of the FF 25 OD and FF 50 OD groups, and 1 subject, <1%, in the 
FF 100 OD group). All 12 subjects took systemic/oral corticosteroids for their severe asthma 
exacerbation. None of the subjects visited an emergency room, were hospitalised or were intubated for 
their asthma exacerbation. All 12 subjects were withdrawn from the study due to their asthma 
exacerbation. 
Study HZA106853 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 58/72 
 
 
 
 
Nine subjects experienced asthma exacerbations during the treatment period (1 subject in the placebo 
group, 3 subjects in the VI 6.25 treatment group, 1 subject in the VI 12.5 treatment group and 4 
subjects in the VI 25 treatment group). Eight subjects were withdrawn from the study due to their 
asthma exacerbation. One subject in the VI 6.25 treatment group, experienced an asthma exacerbation 
on Day 19, but was not withdrawn from the study. One subject in the VI 25 treatment group reported an 
asthma exacerbation during the follow-up period. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Study HZA106855 
Clinical chemistry and haematology parameters  
Shifts (≥5% incidence in any treatment group) to high were noted for albumin, chloride and glucose; 
shifts to low were noted for carbon dioxide. There was no apparent dose ordering in the shifts from 
baseline between the treatment groups. 
Shifts (≥5% incidence in any treatment group) to high or low were noted in eosinophils, haematocrit, 
haemoglobin, lymphocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets. There was no apparent dose ordering in 
the shifts from normal between the treatment groups. 
Overall, shifts in clinical chemistry and haematology parameters were mostly small and were not 
considered of clinical significance. No clinical chemistry or haematology findings were reported as an AE. 
No clinical significantly urinary cortisol suppression was observed at Week 12. 
Study HZA106853 
Clinical chemistry and haematology parameters  
Shifts in clinical chemistry and haematology parameters were mostly small and were not considered of 
clinical significance. No clinical chemistry or haematology findings were reported as an AE. No statistically 
significant differences were observed between placebo and VI treatment in the analysis of potassium 
values. At Week 4 post-dose, small decreases from baseline in glucose levels were observed to be 
statistically significantly greater for placebo (LS mean change: -0.38 mmol/L) compared with VI 6.25 (LS 
mean change: 0.15 mmol/L; treatment difference: 0.24 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.45, p=0.030) and VI 
25 (LS mean change: 0.00 mmol/L; treatment difference: 0.39 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.61, p<0.001), 
but these were not considered to be clinically relevant. 
No statistically significant difference was observed between placebo and any VI dose in the maximum 
change from baseline in glucose at any time post-baseline. 
Study HZA107116 
Glucose 
In study HZA107116, there were no significant changes between baseline and after 24 weeks of 
treatment (FF/VI or FF) in fasting blood glucose, and no difference between the treatment groups. Fasting 
blood glucose was assessed at screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) and at Visit 9 (Week 24).  
For both treatments, a slight decrease of the fasting blood glucose can be observed (Table S09). The LS 
mean change (Std Err) was similar in both treatments (FF/VI: -0.14 [0.027] mmol/L; FF: -0.16 [0.026]

mmol/L). There was also no statistically relevant difference for the changes from baseline between both 
treatments (p=0.616) (Table S10).

Vital Signs, Physical Findings, And Other Observations Related To Safety 
Study HZA106853 
Electrocardiograms 
Abnormal ECG findings at any time post-baseline were considered to be of potential clinical importance 
for 12 subjects (3%): 2 subjects (2%) in the placebo group, 6 subjects (5%) in the VI 6.25 treatment 
group and 2 subjects (2%) in each of the VI 12.5 and VI 25 treatment groups). The only finding of 
potential clinical importance reported for more subjects in a VI treatment group than the placebo group 
was ectopic supraventricular rhythm, reported for no subjects in the placebo group, 5 subjects (4%) in 
the VI 6.25 group and 1 subject (<1%) in each of the VI 12.5 and VI 25 groups. A statistically significant 
increase in ECG heart rate was observed on Day 0 at 5 and 30 minutes post-treatment for the highest 
dose of VI (25 mcg) compared with placebo (3.4 bpm, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.3, p<0.001 and 3.5 bpm, 95% CI: 
1.3, 5.7, p=0.002, respectively). 
However, this was not observed at the end of treatment (Week 4) and there were no reports of AEs of 
increased heart rate or tachycardia during the study. A dose-response analysis of ECG heart rate did not 
show a significant correlation with VI dose. Shifts in QTc(F) interval values were small and no clinically 
relevant trend was apparent. Overall, the ECG data was not considered to raise any safety concerns.

During the study, ECG recordings were taken at screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) and at Visit 9 (Week 24). 
Overall, there was no clear trend or effect in the ECGs during the course of the study with no clinically 
meaningful differences observed between the FF/VI group and the FF group. 
-  Mean Changes from Baseline in ECG Values 
The mean changes from screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) to Visit 9 (Week 24) in ECG values were generally 
similar between the treatment groups. 
Statistical analysis of heart rate at Week 24 did not show a difference between both treatments. 
-  Shift Analyses for ECG Values 
In the FF/VI group, the number of participants with abnormal ECG recordings were similar at screening 
(Visit 1) (-4 Wk) and Visit 9 (Week 24), 55/337 (16%) participants versus 53/337 (17%) participants 
(Table S11). In the FF group, 49/336 (15%) participants showed an abnormal ECG result at screening (-4 
Wk), and at Visit 9 (Week 24), number of participants with abnormal ECG results decreased to 40/336 
(13%). 
Table S11. Summary of ECG Results Interpretations Intent-to-Treat Population (5 to 11 Years Old) (Study 
HZA107116) 
-  Changes in Individual ECG Values from Baseline with Potential Clinical Importance 
The ECG findings of clinical importance at screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk), Visit 9 (Week 24), and any time 
post-baseline are summarized in Table S12. 
At screening (-4 Wk), any abnormality of potential clinical importance was reported in 9% (30/336) and 
10% (32/336) of participants in the FF/VI and FF groups, respectively. Sinus bradycardia was the most 
common abnormality at screening (-4 Wk), reported for 8% (28/336) and 9% (30/336) of participants in 
the FF/VI and FF groups, respectively. 
From screening (-4 Wk) to Visit 9 (Week 24), the number and proportion of participants in the FF/VI 
group with sinus bradycardia increased to 15% (46/303) of participants. In the FF group, the number of 
participants with sinus bradycardia remained the same from screening (-4 Wk) to Visit 9 (Week 24), 9% 
(28/298) of participants in the FF group had sinus bradycardia.

-  QTc(F) 
At screening (Visit 1) (-4 Wk) all participants in both groups showed QTc(F) values of ≤450 ms. At Visit 9 
(Week 24), 1 participant in the FF/VI showed a QTc(F) value within >450 to ≤480 ms. None of the 
participants in the FF group showed a QTc(F) value above 450 ms at any timepoint. 
Maximum changes from baseline in QTc(F) ≥30 ms were observed in 7/337 (2%) and 21/336 (7%) 
participants in the FF/VI group and the FF group, respectively. No participant had a change from baseline 
≥60 ms. 
The statistical analyses of the change from baseline for the QTc(F) data at Week 24 showed an LS mean 
change (SE) for FF/VI of -1.1 (0.86) ms, and for FF of 0.4 (0.86) ms. There was no statistically relevant 
difference between treatments (p=0.210). 
Immunosuppression 
In study HZA107116, there was no indication according to the AEs observed or any safety analyses 
performed, that participants had any unusual or unexpected effects of immunosuppression from the study 
treatment. 
Post-Marketing Data 
Globally, the FF/VI 50/25 mcg strength is only registered for asthma in children 5-11 years old in the US, 
following approval on 12 May 2023, but it is not marketed in any country as of date of this report. 
Administration of FF/VI in this age group, reported to GSK Safety Database from post-marketing sources 
outside of the US, is considered as an off-label use of the product.  
Post-marketing data for FF/VI for all usages and all age groups in the GSK Safety Database are 
continuously reviewed with periodic safety reviews conducted every 3 months. The most recent review of 
spontaneous and post-market surveillance safety data was performed in December 2022. The outcome of 
the review was consistent with the known safety profile for FF/VI and did not indicate any new safety 
signals.

9.3.  Discussion 
This grouped variation application intends to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC with available 
paediatric data based on final results from the study number HZA107116. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to submit the final reports from the phase 2b study HZA106855 (dose ranging of FF alone) 
and the phase 2b study HZA106853 (dose ranging of VI alone) which gives information regarding the 
dose selection for FF and VI combination in study HZA107116, based on the obtained dose-responses.  
In the phase 2b study HZA106855 performed in asthmatic participants from 5 years of age and older 
(n=593), the incidence of overall adverse events was similar across the FF treatment groups (43/118 
[36%] participants for FF 25, 38/120 [32%] participants for FF 50 and 39/118 [33%] participants for FF 
100) and slightly higher than placebo treatment (35/119 [29%] participants). All treatments were well 
tolerated and no new safety concerns were identified during the study. In the active treatment groups, 
few subjects experienced drug-related adverse events (2 subjects; 1 subject in the FF 25 OD group and 1 
subject in the FF 100 OD group), or AEs leading to withdrawal of study drug (5 subjects; 3 subjects in the 
FF 100 OD group and 1 subject in each of the FF 50 OD group and the active control group, FP 100 BD). 
There were two SAEs reported (syncope for a subject in the FF 50 OD group and hepatitis A for a subject 
in the FF 100 OD group), both considered unrelated to study medication. There was no significant effect 
on 24-hour urinary cortisol levels for any of the three strengths of FF). No deaths occurred during the 
study. All FF administered doses were considered well tolerated and no new safety concerns were 
identified during the study. 
In the phase 2b study HZA106853 performed in asthmatic participants from 5 years of age and older 
(n=456), the incidence of overall adverse events was similar across the VI treatment groups (33/114 
[29%] participants for VI 6.25, for 37/113 [33%] participants for VI 12.5 and 32/114 [28%] participants 
for VI 25) and slightly higher than placebo treatment (25/115 [22%] participants). The reporting of drug 
related adverse events was low (5 subjects; 3 subjects in the VI 6.25 treatment group and 2 subjects in 
the VI 12.5 treatment group). There was only one SAE reported (appendicitis in a subject in the VI 25 
treatment group) and one AE leading to withdrawal (appendicitis in a subject in the VI 25 treatment 
group). No deaths occurred during the study. All treatments were considered well tolerated and no new 
safety concerns were identified during the study. 
For 5 to 11 years population in the phase 3 study HZA107116 (n=673), 133/337 (39%) participants in 
the FF/VI group and 122/336 (36%) participants in the FF group experienced at least 1 AE. In 4 (1%) 
participants of the FF/VI group and 4 (1%) participants of the FF group, the investigator considered the 
AEs to be drug-related. In the drug-related AEs, there were no trends in the FF/VI group versus the FF 
group suggesting participants in the FF/VI group had signs or symptoms of adrenergic stimulation.  
In 2 (<1%) participants of the FF/VI group and 1 participant of the FF group, at least 1 AE led to 
permanent discontinuation from study intervention or to premature withdrawal from the study. In both 
groups, at least 1 SAE was reported for 4 (1%) participants in each group. No drug-related SAE, no fatal 
AE and no drug-related fatal AE were reported. The majority of the drug-related AEs occurring were 
reported at maximum for 1 participant per group, only dysphonia was reported for 2 (<1%) participants 
in the FF group. However, FF/VI was well tolerated for both populations and no new safety concerns were 
identified during the study.  
In the phase 2b study HZA106855, effects on glucose were considered as AEs of special interest related 
to the known pharmacological effects of ICS treatment. Shifts to high (≥5% incidence in any treatment 
group) were noted for glucose, but they were not considered of clinical significance and were not even 
reported as an AE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/499751/2023 
Page 63/72 
 
 
 
 
In the phase 2b study HZA106853, no statistically significant difference was observed between placebo 
and any VI dose in the maximum change from baseline in glucose at any time post-baseline.  
In study HZA107116, there were no significant changes between baseline and after 24 weeks of 
treatment (FF/VI or FF) in fasting blood glucose, and no difference between the treatment groups. 
Obtained results for this phase 3 study (FF/VI vs. FF) are consistent with those obtained in phase 2b 
study HZA106853 (VI vs. placebo).  
Overall, taking together the safety obtained results from the submitted clinical studies (two phase 2b 
studies [HZA106855 and HZA106853] and a phase 3 study [HZA107116] performed in asthmatic 
participants from 5 years of age and older, it can be deemed that the administration of FF alone, FF/VI 
combination, at the assayed doses, did not indicate any new safety signals for the studied population. 
This is in line with P46 for FF/VI.

An updated RMP has been submitted to reflect the completion of Phase 3 pivotal paediatric study 
HZA107116, required in the FF/VI Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M12).  
The objective of this post-approval commitment in the EU was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once 
daily FF/VI compared to once daily FF (both via inhalation) in the treatment of asthma in participants 
aged 5 to 11 years old.  
This study did not show a statistically significant improvement in its primary efficacy endpoint of morning 
PEF in the 5-11 years-old population and therefore, no extension of indication in this population has been 
submitted within this procedure.

PRAC Rapporteur’s comment: 
The proposed updates are endorsed. A summary of the changes endorsed is provided below: 
- Modules SI.1 and SI.2 concerning epidemiology information about COPD and asthma have been updated 
using recent publications (i.e, IHME, 2020; GOLD, 2023; GINA 2022). This is endorsed.  
- With regards to module SIII, regarding clinical trials exposure, the MAH has grouped information regarding 
the both indications (COPD and asthma) and the data has been simplified. This is in line with GVP V.B.5.4. 
RMP  part  II,  module  SIII  “Clinical  trial  exposure”  which  states  “(…)  data  should  not  be  presented  by 
individual trial but pooled”. This is endorsed.

completion of study HZA107116 is endorsed. 
- Changes and updates in the text and tables of Modules SIV (regarding both COPD and asthma indications) 
are endorsed. 
- No relevant changes have been performed in module SV. The addition of tables concerning a breakdown 
of patient exposure by indication, sex, age, formulation and region is acceptable.

12.  Changes to the Product Information 
In light of the paediatric data described in the dossier for oral inhalation of FF/VI 50/25 mcg in asthmatic 
children  from  5  to  11  years  old,  the  MAH  proposes  updates  to  sections  4.2  and  5.1  of  the  Summary  of 
Product Characteristics of FF/VI (200/25 mcg and 100/25 mcg) as follows: 
•  Section 4.2:  
This section has been updated to confirm that FF/VI should not be used in children aged under 12 years. 
•  Section 4.8:  
This section has been updated to include a brief description of the study HZA107116 to finally conclude 
that no new safety concerns were identified during this study. Please take into account that this section 
was not planned to be updated as regards of the obtained data from study HZA107116. 
•  Section 5.1:  
This section has been updated to implement a summary of available efficacy and safety results from 
the phase 3 study HZA107116. 
•  Section 5.2:  
This section has been updated to state that the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of FF/VI has been 
also studied in children from 5 to 11 years old. 
Additionally, the MAH has took the opportunity to implement editorial changes to the SmPC, the Package 
Leaflet and Labelling. 
Assessor’s comments: According to the obtained data from the phase 3 study, the MAH is not seeking 
an indication for FF/VI in asthmatics aged 5 to 11 years old in the EU. This approach is endorsed. However, 
the initially proposed changes to the product information were rather extensive and some of them were not 
directly related to this WS. The applicant amended the PI according to Rapporteur’s suggestions. Following 
comments received, the Rapporteur recommended to clarify that FF/VI should not be used in children under 
12 years of age. This wording is justified because there is no added efficacy with the combination compared 
to the FF monocomponent (see final product information attached, which is acceptable for the Rapporteur).

Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The applicant has revised the labelling according to Rapporteur’s suggestions and additional comments 
received (see the product information document attached with track changes). 
The wording for section 4.2 “’should not be used in children’’ is considered more adequate than a 
posology can not be recommended. The Applicant agreed with the updated proposal detailed below:  
Relvar Ellipta should not be used in children under 12 years of age. Currently available data are described 
in sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 3. The position of the applicant not claiming for an extension of indication in this paediatric 
population is acknowledged. However, the applicant should clarify whether a future development is

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for rivaroxaban, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of the available cumulative evaluation of overdose information that was performed during this 
report interval, new information on the highest ingested rivaroxaban dosages that have been reported, 
and as the risk of bleeding related to overdose is warranting clinical surveillance (which has been 
incorporated in the CCDS overdose section), the PRAC considers that such information is of value for 
prescribers. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing rivaroxaban should 
be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for rivaroxaban the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing rivaroxaban is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriasis (PSO) is a common, chronic inflammatory disease characterized by a series of linked cellular 
changes in the skin: hyperplasia of epidermal keratinocytes, vascular hyperplasia and ectasia, and 
infiltration of T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and other types of leucocytes in affected skin. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
The reported prevalence of PSO in countries ranges between 0.09% and 11.43%, with at least 100 
million individuals affected worldwide (WHO report on psoriasis, 2016). PSO affects approximately 3% 
of the adult US population (Rachakonda et al, 2014; Kurd and Gelfand, 2009). Prevalence varies in 
Europe, due in part to different study populations and variability in ascertainment methods, with rates 
ranging between 2% and 6% (Danielsen et al, 2013). 
Individuals with PSO are at an increased risk of developing other chronic and serious health diseases. 
These comorbid diseases include psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome or components of the 
syndrome, cardiovascular disorders, and several other diseases such as anxiety and depression, non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, Crohn’s disease, and lymphoma. 
Risk factors for the development of psoriasis include genetic, environmental, and behavioural factors, 
with genetic factors being the largest contributor. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The hallmark of psoriasis is sustained inflammation that leads to uncontrolled keratinocyte proliferation 
and dysfunctional differentiation. The histology of the psoriatic plaque shows acanthosis (epidermal 
hyperplasia), which overlies inflammatory infiltrates composed of dermal dendritic cells, macrophages, 
T cells, and neutrophils. Neovascularization is also a prominent feature. The inflammatory pathways 
active in plaque psoriasis and the rest of the clinical variants overlap, but also display discrete 
differences that account for the different phenotype and treatment outcomes (Rendon and Schäkel, 
2019).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
There are a variety of forms of PSO including plaque, guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic. 
Plaque PSO (PSO vulgaris) is the most common, comprising approximately 80% to 90% of all cases. It 
is estimated that approximately 80% of patients with plaque PSO have mild to moderate disease while 
20% of patients have more severe disease, which affects either greater than 5% of body surface area 
or is located on high impact areas including scalp, genitals, hands, and nails (Boehncke and Schon, 
2015; Menter et al, 2008). 
The disease usually manifests as raised, well-demarcated, erythematous oval plaques with adherent 
silvery scales (Nestle et al, 2009), commonly presents on the elbows, knees and scalp, and may 
remain localized or become generalized (Lowes et al, 2007). The scalp is the most frequently and 
earliest affected area of the body in both paediatric and adult patients with PSO (Merola et al, 2018). 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 9/220 
 
 
 
Nail involvement is also common, with an estimated prevalence of 50% in patients with plaque PSO. 
Clinical characteristics can range from pits, being the most typical and frequent signs, to complete nail 
destruction with crumbling of the nail plate, resulting in pain and restrictions in daily activities 
(Haneke, 2017; Jiaravuthiasan et al, 2007; de Jong et al, 1996). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Therapy for patients with PSO varies per the severity of disease. Limited or mild disease is often 
treated with topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs, fumarates, and retinoids. 
Patients with more severe disease are often treated with photochemotherapy, ciclosporin, MTX, or 
biologic agents. Each therapy has unique characteristics that contribute to benefits and risks of 
treatment (Stiff et al, 2018; Armstrong et al, 2017; Nast et al, 2015). 
Biologics including, but not limited to, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors and interleukin (IL) 
inhibitors (eg, IL-17 and IL-23), are available treatment options for patients with moderate to severe 
plaque PSO who are candidates for systemic therapy. The effectiveness of TNFα inhibitors in the 
treatment of PSO has been demonstrated in many Phase 3 clinical studies and has led to the approval 
of multiple TNFα inhibitors for use in patients with moderate to severe plaque PSO. Interleukin 
inhibitors approved for PSO include the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, the IL-17A inhibitors 
secukinumab and ixekizumab, the IL-17 receptor antagonist brodalumab, and the IL-23p19 inhibitors 
guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab. These products are injected subcutaneously (sc) or 
delivered via intravenous (iv) infusion. Key safety concerns associated with the use of these biologic 
treatments include an increased risk of developing serious infections and malignancies; however, the 
associated risks vary across the different classes of biologic treatments (Piaserico et al, 2014; Menter 
et al, 2011). 
These agents provide therapeutic options for many patients with moderate to severe plaque PSO, 
allowing achievement of at least a 75% reduction on the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index 
(PASI75). However, fewer patients experience greater improvement (PASI90) or complete clearance 
(PASI100), and as PSO affects all aspects of a patient’s life, an inability to achieve clear skin also 
negatively impacts their QOL. Furthermore, not all patients respond to current therapies and loss of 
response often occurs over time, which leads to patients switching to another medication for symptom 
relief (Kragballe et al, 2014; Piaserico et al, 2014; Menter et al, 2011). Thus, despite the number of 
currently available therapies, there remains an unmet need in the PSO treatment landscape for 
therapeutic agents that can provide more meaningful improvement in the extent and severity of plaque 
PSO.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The application was submitted under the legal basis 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC which corresponds to 
a complete and independent application.  
The development program for bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
(PSO) was discussed with CHMP in two Scientific Advice procedures in May 2016 
(EMEA/H/SA/3306/1/2016/III) and in September 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3306/1/FU/1/2017/III). See 
section 1.1. ‘Scientific advice’. 
Two formulations, three device presentations have been used during the development of bimekizumab. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Bimzelx is presented as a solution for subcutaneous injection in single use pre-filled syringe (PFS) or 
pre-filled pen (PFP). The active substance bimekizumab is formulated with glycine, sodium acetate 
trihydrate, glacial acetic acid, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. Each PFS or PFP contains 160 
mg of bimekizumab in 1 mL solution. 
Bimekizumab is a humanised IgG1/κ monoclonal antibody produced in a genetically engineered 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line by recombinant DNA technology 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Bimekizumab is an engineered, humanised full length IgG1 antibody (approximately 149.9 kDa) which 
is manufactured in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cell.   
Bimekizumab has a high affinity for human interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and human interleukin 17F (IL-17F) 
and selectively and potently binds and inhibits the activity of both isoforms. IL-17A and IL-17F are soluble 
targets  and  key  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  believed  to  play  important  roles  in  autoimmune  and 
inflammatory diseases. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The sites for manufacture, quality control and storage of the active substance are listed in the dossier. 
Active substance manufacture occurs at Rentschler Biopharma (Germany). 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  process  steps  are  divided  in  an  upstream  (cell  culture)  and 
downstream processing (purification). 
Active  substance  production  starts  with  thawing  of  a  vial  of  the  working  cell  bank  (WCB).  Cells  are 
expanded  in  flasks  and  bioreactors  before  being  transferred  to  the  production  bioreactor.  After  the 
production phase, the harvest is collected and clarified. 
After  clarification  of  the  harvest,  further  purification  is  performed  via  several  chromatography  and 
filtration steps. To remove/inactivate possible viruses, a low-pH step and a nanofiltration are performed. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 11/220 
 
 
 
After purification the active substance is formulated. At the end, the active substance is filtered (0.2µm) 
and filled into bottles. The active substance is stored frozen at ≤-600C. 
Reprocessing  procedures  are  established  Examples  of  events  that  could  lead  to  reprocessing  are 
specified. 
Control of materials 
Information is provided on all compendial and non-compendial materials used in the active substance 
manufacturing process. For non-Ph. Eur. materials, quality controls (specifications and acceptance) are 
described  in  detail.  No  raw  materials  were  used  from  animal  or  human  origin.  All  raw  materials  and 
component  materials  used  in  the  production  of  the  active  substance  (except  for  the  production  cells) 
originate  from  non-animal  and  non-human  sources  or  are  compliant  to  the  effective  version  of 
EMA/410/01  (European  Commission:  Note  for  guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal 
spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products), and thus pose no risk 
for transmission of TSE/BSE. 
Porcine  trypsin  and  bovine  serum  were  used  early  in  the  cell  line  development.  However,  a  risk 
assessment and testing showed that there is no risk for BSE/TSE or viral contamination. The qualitative 
composition of media components has been provided along with a confirmation that a quality agreement 
is in place with the vendor to notify the marketing authorisation holder in case of qualitative changes to 
the media composition.  
The  source,  history  and  generation  of  the  cell  banking  system  (master  cell  bank  (MCB)  and  WCB)  is 
adequately  described  and  the  cell  banks  have  been  qualified.  In  addition,  characterisation  of  end-of-
production-cells (EOPC) has also been addressed and genetic stability beyond end-of production stage 
has been demonstrated. The applicant has also provided a release testing programme for future WCBs. 
The cell bank system tested negative for mycobacteria. The applicant has demonstrated (via PCR) that 
the cell banks tested negative for porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus and hepatitis E virus. In line with 
the 3R principles and ICH Q5A, virology testing is not performed in animals on future WCBs and extended 
cell banks.    
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The Applicant provided an overview of critical and key process parameters (KPPs), as well as of all IPCs. 
Overall, the control strategy is deemed sufficient. 
Process validation 
The validation of the bimekizumab active substance manufacturing process was successfully completed 
using three consecutive batches from three independent thaws of the WCB according to the proposed 
commercial active substance process. Results from CPPs and in-process monitoring were provided. All 
process verification results presented for CPPs and KPPs as well as in-process quality controls met the 
predefined acceptance criteria. In addition, the active substance manufacturing process showed sufficient 
capacity for removal of process-related impurities, such as residual host cell proteins (HCP), DNA and 
Protein A. Furthermore, hold times and hold conditions for processed intermediates in the purification 
process  have  been  justified  based  on  supportive  data.  The  proposed  maximum  hold  times  for  the 
intermediates are therefore acceptable. Hold times will be extended through additional validation studies. 
Adequate  detail  is  provided  on  how  these  additional  studies  will  be  performed.  Also  reuse  of 
chromatography resins and the shipping of the active substance to the finished product manufacturing 
site has been adequately validated.  
For  the  0.22  μm  filter  microbial  retention  study,  the  test  microorganism  has  been  specified  and  its 
appropriateness justified.

Based on the process validation results presented, it can be concluded that in general the commercial 
active  substance  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  consistently  and  reproducibly  producing  active 
substance that meets relevant specifications. 
Manufacturing process development 
There were versions of the active substance manufacturing process throughout the process development 
history.  
Comparability  studies  have  been  performed  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  ICH  Q5E.  Analytical 
comparability was assessed using various protein characterisation methods, batch release results, and 
a  comparison  of  accelerated  and  stressed  stability  results.  The  data  demonstrate  that  the  active 
substance  used  throughout  development  and  proposed  for  commercialisation  is  comparable.  The 
comparability  analysis  included  evaluation  of  fucosylated  glycans,  but  not  afucosylation  which  is 
acceptable as it has been demonstrated that Fc-mediated functions do not contribute to the mechanism 
of action of bimekizumab.   
Fc-mediated functions were also not included in the comparability, which is acceptable as it has been 
demonstrated that Fc-mediated functions do not contribute to the mechanism of action of bimekizumab.    
An overview of all the active substance lots produced thus far has been provided. 
Risk assessments to identify the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of bimekizumab were performed using 
an approach aligned with quality by design (QbD) principles described in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, and Q11. 
Quality attributes were identified based on the quality target product profile (QTPP), knowledge of the 
bimekizumab molecule, and information gained during process development and manufacture. No design 
space is claimed. 
Process evaluation studies using scale-down models, which were verified as representative of the large-
scale manufacturing process, have been performed for the bimekizumab active substance manufacturing 
process, to increase process understanding, define the acceptable range for process parameters and to 
identify CPPs that have a significant impact on the CQAs of the product. 
A  summary  has  been  provided  for  the  data  from  the  extractables  &  leachables  (E&L)  assessment  of 
contact materials during the active substance process. The levels and a justification for the levels of any 
E&Ls were provided and are acceptable.   
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure 
Bimekizumab was characterised using a range of biochemical, biophysical and biological techniques. Also 
forced  degradation  studies  were  performed.  Studies  were  performed  using  samples  of  bimekizumab 
selected as representative of the commercial process and/or used in Phase III clinical studies. 
Peptide mapping and molecular weight analysis were performed. Bimekizumab is structurally composed 
of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. The heavy chain contains 455 amino acids 
and the light chain contains 214 amino acids. There are sixteen disulfide bonds in total in bimekizumab: 
twelve  intra-molecular  bonds  and  four  inter-molecular  bonds.  Each  heavy  chain  contains  an  N-linked 
glycan  with  a  biantennary  oligosaccharide  structure at  the  consensus  glycosylation  site  at  asparagine 
305. As bimekizumab is a monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass expressed in a CHO cell line, the 
predominant  glycans  expected  are  asialylated  biantennary  core-fucosylated  structures  differing  in 
terminal  galactose  content.  As  is  typical  with  mammalian  cell  culture  processes,  the  heavy  chain  C-
terminal lysine 455 is mostly removed by carboxypeptidases as a post-translational change.

EMA/393532/2021  
Page 13/220 
 
 
 
The  secondary  and  tertiary  structure  of  bimekizumab  were  evaluated  with  circular  dichroism,  Fourier 
Transform  infrared  (FTIR)  spectroscopy,  intrinsic  fluorescence  analysis  and  differential  scanning 
calorimetry. These analyses confirmed the correct higher-order structures of the molecule. 
Product-related variants were analysed using various techniques. Size-exclusion high-performance liquid 
chromatography  (SEC-HPLC),  analytical  ultra-centrifugation  (AUC)  and  non-reducing  capillary  gel 
electrophoresis (NR-CGE) demonstrated the high monomer purity, with only low amounts of aggregates 
and  low  molecular  weight  species  (LMWS).  Imaged  capillary  electrophoresis  demonstrated  consistent 
charge  variant  profiles  among  bimekizumab  lots.  Liquid  chromatography  electrospray  ionisation  mass 
spectrometry  (LC-ESI-MS)  showed  consistent  and  low  levels  of  deamidation  and  oxidation.  N-glycans 
analysis was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and LC-ESI-MS analysis. 
Also sialic acid content was measured; only low levels of N-acteylneuraminic acid (NANA) were detected 
(no  N-glycolylneuraminic  acid  (NGNA)  was  detected).  N-glycan  analysis  assay  will  be  retained  as  a 
characterisation test in case of relevant future variations related to the upstream process.   
Biological activity analyses of bimekizumab were performed for Il-17A and Il-17F.   
Impurities 
Removal of process-related impurities was adequately evaluated. During process validation, removal of 
residual HCP, DNA and Protein A has been successfully demonstrated. All process-related impurities were 
shown to be removed to very low levels (much lower than the toxicological threshold) which do not raise 
any concern for safety. 
Product-related impurities were characterised and shown to be consistent between batches. 
Specification 
The specification for the active substance includes control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and 
other general tests. 
The  acceptance  criteria  of  the  specifications  are  based  on  batches  that  have  been  utilised  in  clinical 
studies  and  batches  manufactured  with  the  commercial  process  to  define  the  release  and  shelf  life 
acceptance criteria for the commercial active substance. The acceptance criteria for the compendial tests 
are based on pharmacopoeial standards. 
The proposed active substance specifications for purity are deemed sufficient. 
A  test  for  HCP  is  included  in  the  active  substance  specifications.  The  HCP  antigen  has  been  properly 
qualified. In addition, the polyclonal antiserum used in the HCP assay was shown to have coverage that 
was  deemed  sufficient  and  adequate  for  its  use  in  the  HCP  assay.  The  HCP  assay  was  adequately 
validated. 
The  cell-based  assay  (see  below)  is  capable  to  accurately  monitor  batch  consistency  with  regard  to 
potency as well as to detect sub-potent batches. As such, Il-17A/Il-17F binding assays do not need to 
be  included  in  the  active substance  specifications.  The  proposed  acceptance  criteria  for  potency  have 
been sufficiently justified and are deemed acceptable.    
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions are provided for the analytical procedures used in the testing of bimekizumab active 
substance. Analytical procedures were validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1) and USP<1033> for the 
relative potency assay. Compendial procedures have been qualified or validated for testing bimekizumab 
in accordance with applicable pharmacopeia requirements. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 14/220 
 
 
 
Potency assay 
Bimekizumab  binds  and  neutralises  both  IL-17A  and  IL-17F.  This  binding  and  neutralising  activity 
(expressed in % relative potency) of bimekizumab to IL-17A and IL-17F is quantitatively measured by 
cell-based  assay,  which  is  suitable  and  properly  validated  for  release  and  stability  testing  of  active 
substance and finished product.   
Batch analysis 
An  overview  of  all  batches  (28)  and  full  release  testing  data  were  provided,  including  the  process 
verification batches manufactured according to the final commercial process. All results were compliant 
with the specifications. 
Reference material 
Five consecutive reference standards derived from different manufacturing processes were used during 
the  development  of  bimekizumab.  Each  reference  standard  was  prepared  according  to  an  approved 
protocol and qualified to the active substance specification in place at the time of testing. 
Reference  standard  was  prepared.  The  reference  standard  has  been  utilised  in  release  and  stability 
testing of bimekizumab active substance and finished product batches. Reference standard was prepared 
from commercial process. Qualification data for reference standard are provided. All acceptance criteria 
were met. 
Future  reference  standards  will  be  prepared  from  active  substance  batches  manufactured  from  an 
approved  commercial  process.  Each  new  reference  standard  will  be  qualified  against  the  current 
reference  standard  to  ensure  consistency.  The  initial  qualification  of  the  reference  standard  will  be 
performed against the current active substance release specifications. Additional characterisation tests 
will also be performed. Periodic qualification of the reference standard will be performed every 2 years 
by testing against the current active substance shelf life specification. 
Container closure 
The  bimekizumab  active  substance  is  stored  in  sterile  bottles  with  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE) 
screw cap closures. The sterile primary packaging material elements (bottle and screw cap) are received 
as ‘ready-to-use’ container components. The compatibility of bimekizumab with the primary container 
closure  system  is  confirmed  through  leachable/extractable  studies.  The  containers  and  closures  are 
tested  by  the  manufacturers  of  the  container  closure  system  to  pharmacopoeial  standards,  where 
applicable. They are USP class VI compliant and meet the requirements of USP <85> and Ph.Eur. 2.6.14 
for bacterial endotoxins. The bottles additionally comply with USP <661> Plastic Packaging Systems and 
their Materials of Construction. 
Stability 
A shelf life of 42 months when stored at ≤-60°C is claimed for the active substance. 
The Applicant has performed long term stability studies (≤-60°C), accelerated stability studies (5°C±3°C) 
and stressed stability studies (25°C±2°C/60%±5% relative humidity) in accordance with applicable ICH 
guidelines. 
48-month data has been provided from long term stability studies (for 4 lots). All results comply with 
the specifications. No trends are observed. Even under accelerated and stressed conditions, the active 
substance is relatively stable; only a slight increase in HMWS is observed. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 15/220 
 
 
 
Based  on  the  available  results,  the  Applicant  proposes  a  shelf  life  of  42  months  (≤-600C)  which  is 
acceptably supported by the data provided.   
The Applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies in accordance with the testing protocol.  
Post-approval,  1  batch  will  be  placed  on  annual  stability.  Appropriate  stability-indicating  tests  are 
included. In addition, testing for appearance, content, pH and potency are also included.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the finished product 
Bimekizumab finished product is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free 1 mL solution in PFS and PFP 
(clear to slightly opalescent and pale brownish-yellow): 
Pre-filled Syringe (safety syringe) – Type I glass with a fluoropolymer-laminated bromobutyl rubber 
stopper, staked 27G, ½” thin wall needle, and a polypropylene rigid needle shield assembled in a 
passive safety device. 
Pre-filled pen (auto-injector) – containing a pre-filled syringe (Type I glass) with a fluoropolymer-
laminated bromobutyl rubber stopper, staked 27G, ½” thin wall needle, and a polypropylene rigid 
needle shield. 
Commercial bimekizumab is formulated as a nominal formulation at 160 mg/mL bimekizumab in 
sodium acetate trihydrate, glycine, glacial acetic acid, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. All the 
excipients are of compendial grade. None of the excipients used in the finished product are of human 
or animal origin.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Full details of the formulation history throughout clinical development is presented in the dossier. Two 
different formulations and two container closure systems (vial and PFS) have been used in non-clinical 
and clinical studies. The commercial formulation was used in phase III clinical trials. The selection of 
excipients and their concentrations are based on internal knowledge/experience with sodium 
acetate/acetic acid buffer systems and glycine as excipients, development studies, including 
formulation robustness studies (two design of experiments (DoE) studies) and shipping and 
freeze/thaw studies. Overall, the Applicant has presented a good understanding of each component 
used in the commercial formulation and justified their inclusion. 
No preservatives are included in the Bimekizumab PFS. Bioburden and endotoxins are routinely tested 
as IPCs. Sterility and endotoxins are tested at release and over shelf life. 
The parameters identified as influencing the long-term stability of the finished product are pH and 
concentration of the finished product, which are suitably controlled by the manufacturing process and 
included in the release specifications (P.5.1) hence no queries are raised.  
The finished product does not contain an overage of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The PFSs are 
filled with a volume in slight excess (overfill). Clinically relevant physico-chemical and biological 
parameters have been identified. Osmolality and pH adequately controlled at release of finished 
product. While viscosity is not specifically controlled, it is deemed acceptable as any clinically 
significant deviations in viscosity would be detected on release testing for break loose / glide force. 
Manufacturing History 
Manufacturing process development from the early development phase to the commercial production is 
clearly described. Early manufacturing processes (active substance /finished product were carried out. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 16/220 
 
 
 
Subsequently, there were two changes during the active substance manufacturing history – a site 
change which also resulted in a change of container closure (vial to PFS), and then minor changes for 
finished product process improvement Comparability is presented for the site change. 
Process evaluation 
The approach used for process evaluation for the finished product includes prior knowledge from other 
platform therapeutic protein processes. Specific bimekizumab finished product manufacturing steps 
were characterised to optimise process parameters for the following steps: active substance thaw, 
transfer through bioburden reduction filter in process tank and active substance pooling, sterile 
filtration and aseptic filling and stoppering. Details of the studies carried out are described in the 
dossier and considered acceptable. Batches and process verification batches were included in these 
studies. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and normal operating ranges (NORs) were identified for each 
of these steps and demonstrated that the finished product manufacturing process is robust and can 
deliver the required product quality and process consistency when operated within acceptable ranges. 
No negative impact on product quality (size variants, protein concentration, charge heterogeneity, 
subvisible particles, reducing/non-reducing bioanalyser, pH, visible particles, appearance) is observed. 
Filtration was shown to have no impact on the polysorbate 80 content or protein concentration 
(measured before and after filtration).  
Comparability 
Comparability data between the 160 mg/mL vial and PFS presentation is presented and supports 
comparability. PFS batches contains higher levels of particles than vials. No trends were observed with 
time at the recommended storage condition (5±3°C), although the overall levels of subvisible particles 
are higher in the PFS compared to the finished product in the vial.  
Overall, the results presented confirm that quality of the finished product was consistently maintained 
or improved during development and that relocation of manufacturing sites had no negative impact on 
PFS-finished product.  
Batch History 
Details of the lot history of all clinical batches is listed in several tables in the dossier. Pivotal studies 
(PS008, PS009 and PS0013) were carried out. All phase III clinical studies were conducted using the 
commercial PFS assembled into the True North functional secondary packaging. Long-term safety 
studies are conducted using batches manufactured from finished product /commercial process. While 
none of the pivotal studies were carried out in the commercial safety syringe/auto-injector (SS/AI) 
device, supportive clinical studies (UP0033 – phase I bioequivalence study and DV002/DV006 
participant self-injection phase III studies) were conducted using the final assembled devices and 
deemed supportive.  
Finished product commercial safety syringe/auto-injector device 
Details on the manufacturing history of the safety syringe and auto-injector devices, including 
identification of the CQAs, CPPs and critical materials is provided and considered acceptable. The same 
assembly process has been used throughout development. The control strategy is based on the 
relevant medicinal product guidance (ICH quality guidelines Q8, Q9, Q10) as well as medical device 
standards (ISO 13485 and ISO 14971). 
Container closure 
The primary packaging for the bimekizumab finished product consists of a long Type I glass PFS fitted 
with a staked 27G, ½” special thin wall needle. In general, adequate descriptions have been provided 
for the container closure system components, including supplier specifications, technical drawings and 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

dimensions. The components of bimekizumab primary packaging comply with the requirements of the 
relevant Ph. Eur. monographs and ISO 10993. The glass barrel used complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 
(Glass Containers For Pharmaceutical Use), the stopper and shield comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 (Rubber 
Closures For Containers For Aqueous Parenteral Preparations); this is endorsed. The silicone oil used as 
lubricant for the PFS barrel, plunger stopper, and the outside surface of the needle complies with the 
Ph. Eur. 3.1.8 monograph.  
The choice of container closure system for bimekizumab quality and safety has been demonstrated and 
is supported by functionality (break-loose and gliding force, optimal fill volume) and compatibility 
studies (silicone oil analysis including interaction with polysorbate 80, tungsten spike studies). 
Controlled extraction studies were also performed on each component of the container closure. No 
extractables were found above the safety threshold or permitted daily exposure.  
The Applicant notes that the staked needle and rigid needle shield is supplied pre-assembled and 
sterilised with ethylene oxide and the plunger stoppers are supplied sterilised by gamma radiation. 
Further details on the sterilisation methods are provided in the certificates of analysis for each 
component provided in P.2.4, which confirm sterilisation can achieve a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 
10-6. The names and address of the site of sterilisation for the pre-sterilised container closure system 
components are provided.    
Notified Body Opinions (NBOps) in relation to Article 117 of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 
2017/745 have been provided for the safety syringe and auto-injector. The NBOps were issued by BSI 
and confirm compliance with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs). No 
issue in relation to these NBOps has been identified. 
Details on the design, risk management and development of the safety syringe and auto-injector final 
device presentations (conducted in collaboration with the device manufacturers) have also been 
provided and are considered acceptable. Both are single use, with a sharp protection feature for self-
administration by subcutaneous injection and do not have any contact with the finished product 
contained within the PFS. Data is provided showing that a reproducible and accurate dose of the 
product is delivered and that all other CQAs for each device presentation are reproducible.  
The final safety syringe and auto-injector device presentations do not have any contact with the 
finished product hence no compatibility studies were conducted. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The finished product manufacturer is UCB Pharma (Belgium). sites have valid GMP certificates for the 
concerned  activities.  The  bimekizumab  finished  product  composition  is  identical  to  that  of  the  active 
substance, as no further compounding or dilution is performed during the finished product manufacturing 
process. 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  steps:  active  substance  thaw, 
bioburden  reduction  filtration  and  pooling,  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling,  stoppering  and  visual 
inspection and storage.  
 Up  to  three  active  substance  batches  can  be  pooled  for  the  manufacture  of  a  bimekizumab  finished 
product batch.  
The assembly steps of the two devices occur under controlled conditions (18-25°C) and are conducted 
at the assembly site in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 18/220 
 
 
 
CPPs have been identified. An overview of the in-process controls is provided. The control strategy is 
considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
Process verification of the finished product manufacturing process was demonstrated by the successful 
completion of four consecutive process verification batches according to a pre-approved protocol. All four 
process  verification  batches  met  the  pre-determined  acceptance  criteria  for  the  study,  demonstrating 
that  all  steps  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  produced  pre-filled  syringes  meeting  the 
pre-determined quality  attributes.  Also,  the  hold  times  of  the  finished product  manufacturing  process 
have been properly validated. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The specification for the finished product includes control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and 
other general tests, including tests for the safety syringe and auto-injector. 
The proposed specifications are deemed suitable for the control of the finished product. The acceptance 
ranges of the specifications were justified based on the available batch data including those of the clinical 
batches.  For  quality  attributes  that  show  trends  during  shelf  life,  also  stability  data  were  taken  into 
account  to  set  and  justify  the  specification  limits.  Any  impurities  present  in  the  finished  product  are 
carried over from the active substance.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the active substance and finished product has been 
assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D guideline for elemental impurities. Four 
finished product lots were screened by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). No 
elemental impurities were detected above 30% of the permitted daily exposure. The risk of carryover 
of elemental impurities from reagents and materials used for manufacture is considered negligible and 
no additional control is required. 
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/Applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004 - Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is 
accepted  that  no  risk  was  identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance or finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical methods 
Details of the analytical procedures applied to test bimekizumab finished product are provided. Many of 
the analytical procedures are common to testing both active substance and finished product. Analytical 
procedures were validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1). Compendial procedures were verified and 
confirmed suitable for their intended use. 
Batch analysis 
An overview of all batches and full release testing data were provided, including the 4 finished product 
process  validation  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  final  commercial  process.  All  results  were 
compliant with the specifications. 
Reference material 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

As the active substance and finished product have the same composition, the same reference standards 
are used for both active substance and finished product testing. 
Container closure 
The primary packaging for the bimekizumab finished product consists of a long Type I glass PFS fitted 
with a staked 27G, ½” special thin wall needle (see above). In general, adequate descriptions have 
been provided for the container closure system components, including supplier specifications, technical 
drawings and dimensions.     
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months when stored at 5°C±3°C is claimed for the finished product. 
The  Applicant  has  performed  long-term  stability  studies  (5°C±3°C),  accelerated  stability  studies 
(25±2°C/60±5%RH)  and  stressed  stability  studies  (30±2°C/75±5%RH  or  40±2°C/75±5%RH)  in 
accordance with the applicable ICH guidelines.  
Currently data up to 36 months are available (six batches of real time data for the 36 month time point. 
All results comply with the specifications. A thermal-cycling stability study, using one batch of finished 
product, demonstrated no impact to the finished product over 3 cycles alternating between -5±3°C and 
5±3°C. 
Based on the data presented, the proposed shelf life of 36 months (5°C±3°C) for the finished product is 
considered acceptable. Bimzelx may be stored at room temperature (up to 25°C) for a single period of 
maximum 25 days with protection from light. Once removed from the refrigerator and stored under these 
conditions,  the  PFS  or  PFP  should  be  discarded  after  25  days  or  by  the  expiry  date  printed  on  the 
container, whichever occurs first. 
A  photostability  study,  performed  according to ICH Q1B  light source option 2 conditions on 1  batch of 
PFS, demonstrated that bimekizumab PFS is sensitive to light exposure. Therefore, the PFS and PFP should 
be kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
The device components do not have any fluid path and do not have any contact with the bimekizumab 
solution contained within the PFS. Therefore, the stability of the bimekizumab FP in the PFS is not impacted 
by assembly into the bimekizumab-safety syringe device or bimekizumab-auto-injector device. 
The Applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies in accordance with the testing protocol. 
Adventitious agents 
The  Applicant  has  taken  adequate  and  sufficient  measures  to  avoid  possible  contamination  by 
adventitious agents. The cell bank system has been thoroughly screened for possible viral contaminants. 
During manufacture the combination of IPC (bioburden, mycoplasma, in vitro adventitious agents) and 
release testing (bioburden sterility, endotoxin) guarantees the absence of contaminating agents. 
A viral clearance study in accordance with ICH Q5A was performed using a representative small-scale 
process. The choice of the 4 model viruses (MLV, PRV, Reo3 and MVM) is deemed acceptable. Four active 
substance  process  steps  were  shown  and  validated  to  remove  or  inactivate  viruses.  The  scaled-down 
process steps were qualified to be representative of the full-scale process.  
Overall, high clearance/inactivation factors were observed for all 4 model viruses. The results support 
the claimed viral clearance throughout the resin lifetime.  
As such, the viral risk associated with bimekizumab is negligible.

The transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)/bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status for 
the raw materials used in the manufacture of bimekizumab active substance have been assessed and 
confirmed to be compliant with EMA/410/01 (current version): Note for guidance on minimizing the risk 
of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products. 
The risk of transmitting TSE/BSE agents is considered very low. 
Overall, the adventious agents safety is considered sufficiently assured. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the bimekizumab quality dossier is of high quality. The active substance manufacturing 
process is adequately controlled to ensure routine production of material that meets the intended 
quality and that is representative of material used in the clinical development programme. Therefore, 
the batches used in clinical trials are representative with regards to the commercial product to 
guarantee that the latter will be the same as the clinical batches. The active substance and impurities 
have been adequately characterised. The control strategy sufficiently guarantees consistent and 
satisfactory quality of the product. The release testing and methods will ensure material of adequate 
quality. The proposed shelf life of the active substance is adequately supported by stability data. The 
material is acceptably safe from an adventitious agents and viral safety perspective.  
The documentation provided for the manufacture, control and stability of the finished product is 
sufficiently detailed. The product is formulated using commonly used excipients. Sufficient details are 
provided detailing the pharmaceutical development of the product from early formulations in a vial 
through to the commercial product. Data presented throughout the process development confirm that 
quality of the finished product was consistently maintained or improved during development and that 
the commercial product is the same as batches used in clinical studies. The process is well 
characterised and process validation data supports the proposed process. Release and stability 
specifications ensure adequate control of the finished product. The methods are suitably validated. The 
product is stable and safe for use for the proposed shelf life.   
All issues raised during the procedure have been resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Bimzelx is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in 
the SmPC. Physico-chemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the 
product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation 
application for Bimzelx is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None.

The non-clinical evaluation has been conducted in the Cynomolgus monkey only since bimekizumab 
has no or very low affinity for mouse IL-17A, IL-17F or IL-17AF. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of bimekizumab was investigated after single and multiple intravenous (iv) 
and subcutaneous (sc) injections in the Cynomolgus monkey. 
Toxicology studies included a single-dose study and repeat dose studies in the Cynomolgus monkey 
with dose levels up to 200mg/kg/week for up to 26 weeks of duration in support to chronic human 
dosing.  Assessments included effects on cardiovascular variables (repeat-dose studies), clinical 
observations, laboratory safety variables, immunophenotyping, T cell-dependent response to 
immunization, reproductive endpoints (26-week study) and histopathological changes. Intravenous and 
subcutaneous routes of administration were explored. 
No evaluation of the genotoxic potential was performed and no standard carcinogenicity bioassays 
were conducted since the standard tests used were considered inappropriate for a monoclonal 
antibody. A Carcinogenicity Assessment was presented based on literature review and an evaluation of 
the applicant own non-clinical and clinical data. 
General toxicity studies were all conducted in accordance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamics studies with bimekizumab were conducted in vitro.  
Pharmacodynamic activity of bimekizumab was investigated in primary cultures of normal human 
dermal fibroblasts (NHEK) and epithelial keratinocytes (NHDF). Bimekizumab prevented CXCL-1 
(chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1) secretion in NHEKs and NHDFs incubated with activated Th17 cell 
serum. PCR analysis identified that bimekizumab altered gene expression responses with greater 
activity than inhibition of IL-17A only. Inhibition of IL-17F had minimal to no effect on gene expression 
responses). The presence of IL-17A/F expression on normal epidermal tissue and inflammatory cells in 
the lesioned psoriatic skin was qualitatively presented by the applicant.  
Affinity studies were performed by surface plasmon resonance on BIAcore and using a cell-based assay 
with stimulated NIH-373 cells. BIAcore data identified Kd values for IL-17A, IL-17F and the 
heterodimer IL-17AF. Affinity for IL-17F was 8-fold lower than Il-17A and comparable to the affinity for 
the heterodimer AF.

In the NIH-3T3 assay, which used IL-6 secretion as the readout, cells were stimulated with human IL- 
17A or IL-17F (in combination with recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)). Bimekizumab 
inhibited both secretion of IL-6 elicited by IL-17A or IL-17F; again, bimekizumab had higher affinity for

EMA/393532/2021  
Page 22/220 
 
 
 
 
IL-17A, ~39-fold higher than IL-17F. A separate NIH-3T3 assay was conducted with UCB mAbs specific 
for IL-17A or a commercial IL-17F antibody; again bimekizumab inhibited Il-6 to a greater extent than 
the IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitors alone. A third type of potency assay was performed in NHDF however 
values could not be determined in this experimental system. A transwell assay with NHDFs 
investigated neutrophil and monocyte migration where bimekizumab demonstrated the greatest 
capacity to inhibit migratory activity, indicating that total IL-17 inhibition is important for this effect. In 
this setting, selective inhibition of IL-17F had minimal impact, whereas anti-IL-17A antibody notably 
suppressed the migratory capacity of human neutrophils and monocytes. Interestingly, dual blockade 
of both IL-7A and IL-17F with bimekizumab showed the greatest capacity to inhibit neutrophil and 
monocyte migration, indicating that to fully inhibit IL-17 mediated inflammation, both IL-17A and IL-
17F must be neutralized. 
A comparison of affinity and potency of bimekizumab in Cynomolgus monkeys was investigated using 
surface plasmon resonance in BIAcore and an NIH-3T3 bioassay. In the BIAcore analysis the affinity of 
bimekizumab for cynomolgus IL-17A and IL-17F was lower 3.5-fold and 12-fold, respectively compared 
to human. The capacity of bimekizumab to cross react with Cynomolgus monkey IL-17A and IL-17F 
was also determined in the NIH-3T3 cell bioassay, where affinity of bimekizumab for IL-17A was ~1.6-
fold higher in monkeys, and ~2-fold lower for monkey IL-17F.  
No in vitro data is available with regards to the binding of bimekizumab to other unrelated cytokines. 
This was justified by the selectivity of bimekizumab and by the lack of sequence homology across 
those cytokines as compared to the target ligands IL-17A and IL-17F. Furthermore, no cytokine 
mediated effect and no change in cytokine levels were noted in non-human primates (NHP) 
administered bimekizumab. 
No in vivo pharmacodynamics assessment has been conducted given the low expression of IL- 17A and 
IL-17F in normal tissues, as no direct pharmacodynamics markers are available, and as no appropriate 
and relevant animal model of PSO is available. Furthermore, mice models of inflammation involving IL-
17 do not seem appropriate since murine IL-17F has shown a different physiological role and 
regulation. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies investigated the potential for antibody-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) in NHDFs co-cultured with hIL-17A or hIL-17F, with cetuximab as a positive 
control. There was no evidence of reduced cell viability indicating bimekizmab does not mediate ADCC. 
Similarly, the potential for complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was investigated in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) pre-stimulated with hIL-17A or hIL-17F. There was no effect of 
bimekizumab on PBMC viability at any dose level, compared to control and positive control 
alemtuzumab. The applicant states that Bimekizumab is devoid of Fc effector functions since its targets 
are soluble. An in vitro study (study 40001929) assessing the cell depletive potential of bimekizumab 
via ADCC or CDC on IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells was conducted. Activated PBMCs from two 
independent human donors were cultured with varying concentrations up to 100 µg/mL of either 
bimekizumab or secukinumab (IgG1 anti-IL-17A), and changes in IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells were 
monitored by flow cytometry after 24h. Rituximab and ocrelizumab, which are known B cell depletors 
active by ADCC and CDC mechanisms, were used as a positive control in this assay. The results 
indicated that both bimekizumab and secukinumab did not alter the number of CD4+ IL-17+ T cells 
whereas in the same assay rituximab, and ocrelizumab efficiently ablated CD20+ B cells. These results 
indicate a ligand (Class III IgGs)-mediated effect rather than an ADCC/CDC-related effect as the 
underlying mechanism of action of bimekizumab to inhibit IL-17A/IL-17F signalling. The absence of 
relevant toxicity in non-clinical studies supports these conclusions.  
In vivo treatment with an anti-IL-17 antibody may be associated with neutropenia. Administration of 
anti-IL-17 antibodies in humans indicated that this potential risk was low and reversible. Furthermore, 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 23/220 
 
 
 
no effects on circulating levels of neutrophils were observed in toxicity studies performed in 
Cynomolgus monkey. See section 2.6 on clinical safety.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies were conducted, instead safety endpoints were included in 
GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicology studies. No effects on the central nervous system were noted 
and clinical observations in repeat-dose studies suggest bimekizumab did not alter respiration. 
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology was investigated in the 8-week and 26-week repeat dose studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys. No changes in cardiovascular variables (systemic arterial blood pressure 
[systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure] or heart rate), and no significant effects on 
electrocardiogram (ECG) Lead II parameters (PR, RR, QT, QTc intervals, and QRS duration) were 
produced at any dose. There were no abnormalities in the ECG waveform or morphology that could be 
directly attributed to administration of bimekizumab. Exposure to bimekizumab was adequate to 
ensure neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F at levels sufficiently in excess of the KD of bimekizumab (in 
the picomolar range). No renal pharmacology studies have been conducted. The applicant considered 
that since antibodies are degraded by non-specific cell uptake followed by lysosomal degradation, the 
renal function is not expected to be impacted by their catabolism.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) drug interactions are not expected with monoclonal antibodies, thus, no non-
clinical PD drug interactions studies were conducted. Cytokines e.g. Il-6, can alter activity of CYP450, 
thus inhibition of IL-17A/F by bimekizumab could circumvent this in the psoriatic patient.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the non-clinical development of bimekizumab, several PK assays were developed and 
validated (see table below).

No dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with bimekizumab. The toxicokinetics of 
bimekizumab were characterised in single and repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Doses of up to 200 mg/kg/week were administered i.v. or s.c., the latter reflecting the intended clinical 
route of administration. Dose proportionality was generally demonstrated; bimekizumab had a slow 
elimination and extended terminal half-life. Steady-state concentrations was reached after 7-9 weekly

doses in most animals. Following i.v. administration the mean volume of distribution (Vz) ranged 
between 93.7mL/kg and 109mL/kg, independently of the dose, and the mean clearance (CL) ranged 
between 4.5mL/day/kg and 5.5mL/day/kg. No sex differences in bimekizumab exposure were noted in 
repeat-dose studies. In the enhanced peri- and postnatal development (ePPND) study, bimekizumab 
exposure was evident in infants confirming significant in utero exposure, persisting into the postnatal 
period at concentrations considered sufficient to fully inhibit IL-17A and IL-17F.   
Sustained exposure to bimekizumab is reported in all the toxicity studies conducted in the NHP 
administered monotherapy, including for high dose levels. Therefore, detection of ADA was not 
systematically evaluated. ADAs were measured in the 8-week study with adalimumab and the ePPND 
study. In the 8-week study with adalimumab, only co-treated animals displayed reduced bimekizumab 
exposure after repeated doses and select animals in 2 mg/kg/week and 20 mg/kg/week groups were 
positive for anti-bimekizumab antibodies. The presence of ADAs to bimekizumab was also evident in all 
mothers and infants in the ePPND study in the postnatal period, after cessation of treatment. However, 
the applicant considered that production of ADA in those studies does not represent a concern for the 
interpretation of the pivotal toxicity studies where sustained exposure was achieved.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant submitted a toxicology package consisting of a single dose toxicity study, an 8-week 
repeat dose study, an 8-week repeat dose study with adalimumab, a 26-week repeat dose study and 
an ePPND toxicity study. All studies were in compliance with GLP and investigated the clinical route of 
administration (subcutaneous). A once weekly dosing regimen was employed in all studies (except for 
the single dose study) to achieve exposures in excess of those anticipated with the proposed clinical 
regimen. Cynomolgus monkeys were used in all studies as they were considered to be the only 
relevant non-clinical species by the applicant.   
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
The main finding in single and repeat dose studies was the increased risk of infection due to reduced 
muco-epidermal immunity. In the single dose and 8-week study with bimekizumab, the applicant 
concluded that Balantidium coli was the causative pathogen, considered to be species-specific and not 
relevant to humans. In the 8-week study, gastrointestinal (GI) lesions were noted as pathological 
correlate of Balantidium coli infection and resolved during the 12-week recovery period. To circumvent 
the issue of Balantidium coli infection, animals in the 26-week repeat dose study were pre-treated with 
metronidazole to reduce the balantidium coli load. Superficial dermatitis was the most prevalent 
finding in the 26-week study, likely resulting from on-target pharmacology and/ or hypersecretion of 
IL-21, IL-22, and/or IL-17C. This finding was generally considered to be low grade and improved in 
recovery phase but the effect was not completely reversible. While this finding was not observed in the 
8-week study, despite significant bimekizumab exposure in the recovery period due to the extended 
half-life of the active substance, external factors that may have influenced this difference between the 
studies which were conducted at different facilities, including differences in the genetic background, 
housing conditions and age of the monkeys.  
The no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was the highest dose tested in the 8-week studies 
(200mg/kg/week and 20mg/kg/week, respectively, for Study NCD2260 and Study NCD2384). 
Due to the severity of skin findings in some high-dose animals and mortalities in the low dose group 
consecutive to GI infection, no NOAEL could be determined in the 26-week study. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 25/220 
 
 
 
However, if it is considered that infections and microorganism-related changes are not directly 
translatable from NHP to humans, the safety ratio can be calculated using the exposure at the high 
dose in this study (corresponding to AUC0-7days of 23967 day.μg/mL and Cmax of 4303μg/mL). 
One animal was euthanized at Day 115 of the treatment phase due to repeated enteritis in the 26-
week study. A second animal was euthanized in the recovery phase due to the same issue. No 
causative pathogen was identified in either case. A NOAEL was not defined in this study. The applicant 
postulates that reduced mucosal immune surveillance as a consequence of on-target pharmacology of 
bimekizumab, and similar to marketed IL-17A inhibitors could underlie these findings.  
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted with bimekizumab in line with ICH S6 (R1) guideline. 
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant submitted a carcinogenicity assessment document (CAD) reviewing the weight-of-
evidence for IL-17A and IL-17F in carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Although the information 
published on the role of IL-17 in tumour promotion is still confusing, based on the weight of the 
evidence available to date, neutralizing IL-17A does not suggest an increased tumour promoting risk. 
Bimekizumab is also pharmacologically active in the inhibition of IL-17F. There is minimal evidence on 
the potential tumorigenic role of IL-17F. Generally, IL-17F functions are less potent than IL-17A and 
have not been reported to recruit leukocytes or promote angiogenesis. In addition, no pre-neoplastic 
or neoplastic lesions are reported from the chronic repeat-dose toxicity study monkeys, following 26 
weeks of sc dosing up to 200mg/kg/week, with exposure at the high dose in this study (corresponding 
to AUC0-7days of 23967 day.μg/mL and Cmax of 4303μg/mL) 109 times the human exposure at 
320 mg every 4 weeks. Malignancy is identified as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are supported by an evaluation of fertility in sexually 
mature animals used in the 26-week repeat dose toxicology study and an enhanced peri- and postnatal 
development (ePPND) study. There was no evidence of impaired fertility parameters in either sex in 
the 26-week study (i.e. no effects were observed on semen quality, testicular size, and spermatic 
staging in males and menstrual cycle duration in females following bimekizumab treatment.). The 
ePPND study was carried out in cynomolgus monkeys; female animals were dosed weekly from GD20 
to parturition. No effects on survival rate, external or internal morphology, or skeletal formation were 
noted. Steady state concentrations of bimekizumab was achieved in maternal animals between GD83 
and GD139. Comparable bimekizumab concentrations were detected in mothers and infants at PND7 
indicating significant in utero exposure via placental transfer and pharmacologically-relevant 
concentrations persisted for a minimum of 2 months in post-natal period. In maternal animals, the 
main finding was dose-related mild non-adverse skin changes representative of superficial dermatitis. 
In infants, the main finding was transient discolouration of the lips; this was considered non-adverse. 
Exposure achieved in this study represents a 27-fold safety margin to the anticipated clinical exposure. 
No juvenile toxicity studies were conducted as the ePPND study was considered sufficient to cover the 
developmental period of the immune system and no effects were observed. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 26/220 
 
 
 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic analysis was performed in all pivotal studies. Exposure-based safety margins were 
derived on the basis of exposure at the maximum dose (200 mg/kg/week) in the 26-week repeat dose 
study and the NOAEL in ePPND study. Exposures were significantly in excess of anticipated clinical 
exposure.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance after iv and sc administration of bimekizumab was investigated as part of the 8- week- 
and 26-week repeat dose toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. There was no evidence of 
macroscopic changes at the injection site after treatment.  
Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity was investigated using a panel of 37 tissues from human and cynomolgus 
monkey. There was no evidence of specific or non-specific staining in any tissues from human and 
Cynomolgus monkey. Bimekizumab did not demonstrate haemolytic potential on human or cynomolgus 
monkey blood in vitro.  
Immunotoxicity was investigated as part of repeat dose toxicity studies (Studies NCD2260, NCD2384 
and NCD2450). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bimekizumab does not contain non-natural amino acids or modifications. It is expected to be subject to 
the same in vivo degradation pathways as natural proteins and to have the same environmental 
impact as naturally occurring human antibodies. According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment on Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides 
and proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Consequently, no Environmental Risk Assessment for bimekizumab is required. The CHMP considered 
this acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package for bimekizumab includes in vitro pharmacology studies demonstrating the 
affinity of the active substance for Il-17A and Il-17F and neutralizing activity against human and 
cynomolgus Il-17A, IL-17F and the heterodimer IL-17A/F. No dedicated PK studies were conducted in 
line with ICH S6 (R1). PK was characterised as part of toxicokinetic assessment in single and repeat-
dose toxicology studies. The toxicology package is composed of a single dose study, an 8-week repeat-
dose study, another 8-week repeat-dose study in combination with adalimumab, a 26-week repeat-
dose study and an ePPND in cynomolgus monkeys. The non-clinical package is in line with 
requirements set out in relevant guidance including ICH M3 (R2) and ICH S6 (R1). 
All pivotal studies were performed in compliance with GLP. 
Pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic studies indicated that bimekizumab is a potent inhibitor of IL-17A and to a much 
lesser extent, of IL-17F. Studies illustrated that dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F elicited greater 
reductions in IL-6 release and inhibitory migratory activity compared to proprietary IL-17A- and IL-
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 27/220 
 
 
 
17F-inhibitors. Bimekizumab binding affinity was approximately 12-fold and 3.5-fold lower for IL-17F 
and IL-17A, respectively in cynomolgus monkeys compared to humans, but in vitro efficacy in 
inhibiting IL-6 secretion was similar between the species, suggesting that this difference in binding 
affinity is not clinically relevant. The binding profile of bimekizumab to other IL-17 family members and 
other cytokines has not been evaluated thus, no in vitro data is available with regards to the binding of 
bimekizumab to other unrelated cytokines. This is acceptable to the CHMP based on the lack of 
sequence homology with other cytokines as compared to the target ligands IL-17A and IL-17F. 
Furthermore, no cytokine mediated effect and no change in cytokine levels were noted in NHP 
administered bimekizumab. Therefore, the applicant’s justification for not performing binding studies 
with other unrelated cytokines is agreed by the CHMP. There is no evidence of ADCC or CDC, data 
suggested that bimekizumab is mediating its biological and therapeutic effects solely through the 
inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F signalling, without involvement of a depleting effect on IL-17-producing 
cells. There was no evidence of non-specific binding of bimekizumab in a range of human tissues.  
Safety pharmacology evaluation is in line with relevant guidance for monoclonal antibodies. CNS and 
respiratory safety pharmacology endpoints were included in GLP-compliant repeat-dose studies; no 
overt findings were observed. Cardiovascular safety was also investigated in the studies and no 
abnormalities in blood pressure or ECG waveform were noted. The exposure achieved in the studies is 
considered significantly in excess of anticipated clinical exposure and thus the safety pharmacology 
investigation is considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of bimekizumab were investigated in repeat-dose and ePPND toxicity studies. Intravenous and 
subcutaneous administration were employed, the latter reflecting the proposed clinical route of 
administration. Exposure to bimekizumab was generally dose-proportional, with slow elimination and a 
long terminal half-life. Steady state concentrations were typically achieved after 7-9 weekly doses. 
There was no sex difference in bimekizumab exposure across the studies. ADAs were measured only in 
studies were decreased exposure indicated ADA measurement was warranted. This included the 8-
week study with adalimumab; reduced bimekizumab exposure in co-treated animals was associated 
with anti-bimekizumab antibodies. In the ePPND study, ADAs were present in the postnatal period for 
maternal and infant animals, after the cessation of treatment. However, the production of ADA in these 
studies does not represent a concern for the interpretation of the pivotal toxicity studies where 
sustained exposure was achieved. In addition, the maintained exposure of bimekizumab during the 
treatment phase was associated in some animals with signs of exaggerated pharmacodynamics but not 
with toxicities related to immune-complex formation. Therefore, the lack of further investigation on 
ADAs with regards to their neutralising potential, timing of occurrence and relationship with the dose of 
bimekizumab is acceptable, in particular since the occurrence of ADA in animal species is not predictive 
for the human. 
Toxicology 
The toxicology package for bimekizumab is comprised of a single-dose toxicity study, and repeat dose 
toxicity studies including two 8-week studies (one with adalimumab, 12-week recovery in both), a 26-
week study (21-week recovery) and an ePPND study. Reduced muco-epidermal immunity was a 
common observation in all studies, due to exaggerated pharmacological action of bimekizumab. 
Findings of note include GI lesions in the 8-week study (attributed to balantidium coli infection) and 
superficial dermatitis was the predominant finding in the 26-week study, emerging at a treatment 
timepoint that achieved bimekizumab exposure that was likely to be present in the recovery period of 
the 8-week study due to the long-terminal half-life of bimekizumab. This differential finding of 
superficial dermatitis in the 8-week and 26-week studies is likely the result of external factors 
(including differences in the genetic background, housing conditions and age of the monkeys) due to 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 28/220 
 
 
 
the conduct of the studies in different testing facilities. The definition of a NOAEL in the 26-week study 
was confounded by the finding of repeated enteritis (requiring euthanasia of 2 animals) in the 50 
mg/kg/week dose group. The applicant’s position is that this finding is representative of reduced muco-
epidermal immunity due to exaggerated pharmacology of bimekizumab. While a causative pathogen 
has not been identified, given the high GI sensitivity of the monkey as compared to human, together 
with the fact that the GI tract was not identified as a target organ in humans with inborn errors of IL-
17 immunity, the translation of the severe GI toxicity findings noted in the monkey to the human 
situation is considered of limited relevance.  
No genotoxicity studies were conducted for bimekizumab in line with ICH S6 (R1). A carcinogenetic 
assessment has been submitted in lieu of formal carcinogenicity studies reviewing the potential pro- 
and anti-tumorigenic effects of IL-17A and IL-17F inhibition; this is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. The evidence on the carcinogenic potential of IL-17F is minimal. There is conflicting evidence for 
IL-17A and dual IL-17/IL-17F inhibition in tumorigenesis carcinogenic potential. Malignancy has been 
identified as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be further followed-up as part of ongoing 
studies (PS0014 and PS0015) and planned PASS study (see sections 2.6 on Clinical Safety and 2.7 on 
Risk Management Plan). This is considered appropriate by the CHMP.  
The ePPND study did not identify any effects in maternal or infant animals. At birth, serum 
bimekizumab concentrations in infant monkeys were comparable to those of mothers. Adequate 
exposure was achieved and in utero exposure was thus confirmed. Superficial dermatitis (maternal) 
and transient discolouration of the lips (infants) were the notable observations in this study. ADAs 
were present in maternal and infant animals. The safety margin to the anticipated clinical exposure 
was 27-fold (based on AUC). No other toxicology studies were performed. Local tolerance and 
immunotoxicity were assessed as part of repeat-dose studies which is acceptable. 
Bimekizumab is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, bimekizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
The results of the toxicity studies are reflected in section 5.3 ‘Pre-clinical safety data’ of the SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data is sufficient for authorisation of bimekizumab in adult patients with 
psoriasis. Malignancy is an important potential risk and additional pharmacovigilance activities is 
expected to address this safety concern in the post marketing setting.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The bimekizumab clinical pharmacology programme characterized the PK, PD, immunogenicity, dose-
exposure-response, and dose-exposure-safety properties of bimekizumab based on data from Phase 1, 
2, and 3 studies in healthy study participants and study participants with moderate to severe plaque 
PSO. Clinical responses (PASI and IGA) were used as PD assessments throughout the development of 
bimekizumab. No other PD or PD biomarker analyses outside of efficacy assessments were conducted.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 16 clinical studies provided data to characterise the PK and PD of bimekizumab in patients 
with psoriasis. These included 4 clinical pharmacology studies and 12 studies (biopharmaceutics, 
efficacy and safety studies) providing supportive data including PK, PD, and immunogenicity of 
bimekizumab. In addition, three population PK and PK/PD analyses have been completed. 
Analytical methods 
Three PK methods were used throughout the clinical programme. Method #1 was an ECLIA assay used 
in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (except the BE study UP0033 and vaccine study UP0034). Method #2 
was used in Phase 3 studies and employed a similar platform to Method #1 but used an anti-
bimekizumab idiotypic antibody for detection rather than an anti-human IgG in order to achieve a 
higher assay passing rate. Method #3 was only used for study UP0034. It is the same as Method #2 
but conducted at a different CRO.  
The methods covered a suitable range and were validated for accuracy, precision, dilution linearity, 
parallelism and selectivity. Target interference was studied by spiking samples with IL-17A and IL-17F; 
the serum levels of IL-17 are below the levels shown to interfere with the assay. Cross-validation 
performed between method 1 and 2 was successfully demonstrated. Finally, PK Method 2 was 
transferred successfully to another vendor and validated as PK Method 3. Long term sample stability 
data covered the storage period of all the study samples. 
The presence of ADAs in human plasma was determined using solution-ligand binding assays utilizing 
the MSD platform. A tiered-based assay approach was used, involving screening, confirmatory, and 
titre assays. Only samples that were positive in the screening assay were taken forward to a 
confirmatory assay. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was detected using a competitive ligand 
binding assays (CLBAs) for both IL-17A and IL-17F. The evaluation of the neutralizing capacity of the 
confirmed ADA positive samples has been investigated in the phase III clinical studies (PS0008, 
PS0009 and PS0013).  
The ADA assay has been developed and progressively optimized to improve target and drug tolerance 
up to the ADAb-5 assay used in the phase 3 clinical studies. ADAb against UCB4940 in human plasma 
are detected using an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay. In this assay, the samples are 
incubated in acetic acid and then neutralized with Master Mix containing Biotin-UCB4940, Sulfo-Tag-
UCB4940, the anti-human IL-17A, and rabbit anti-human IL-17F. Any ADA present in the human 
plasma will form a bridge between the Biotin-UCB4940 and Sulfo-Tag-UCB4940 molecules, with the 
anti-human IL-17A and anti-human IL-17F mitigating any target interference. This complex is then 
bound to a blocked MSD-Streptavidin plate and detected by a chemiluminescent signal that is 
generated when voltage is applied. The resulting electrochemiluminescent signal (ECL or relative light 
units, RLU) is directly proportional to the amount of ADA present in the human plasma. 
A competitive ligand binding (CLB) assay format has been used to investigate the neutralizing potential 
of binding anti-drug antibodies. The CLBA method comprises 2 NAb assays, with specificity for IL-17AA 
and IL-17FF, respectively. In these NAb assays, ADAb compete with labeled target to bind to the drug. 
Neutralization of IL-17AA and IL-17FF binding to the drug is assessed in each respective assay 
separately. Both NAb assays are electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based assays using solid-phase 
extraction with acid dissociation (SPEAD) sample pre-treatment.

Population PK analyses 
CL0453 
A population PK analysis to estimate the absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous bimekizumab 
administration. Data collected from four single-dose bimekizumab clinical studies [UP0008 (IV), 
UP0031 (SC), UP0042 (SC) and RA0124 (SC and IV)] were pooled and analysed. 
The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption after SC administration, 
bioavailability of SC administration and first-order elimination. Weight was included as a covariate on 
both CL and V2. The absolute bioavailability was estimated to 70.1%. Parameter estimates for the final 
2-compartment model are provided in Table 4. Visual predictive checks (VPCs) are presented in 
Figure 1 (IV administration and SC administration).

bimekizumab administration 
CL0466 
The popPK model was developed using combined data from the Phase 2B study PS0010 and the Phase 
2A study PS0016. The model was initially developed using a pre-final dataset including data up to 
Week 16. The pre-final model was then rerun with the final dataset once the data after Week 16 from 
PS0016 became available. 
The structural model was a one compartment model with first order absorption and first order 
elimination. At the end of the stepwise covariate modelling procedure, the only covariate kept in the 
model was WT on CL/F and V/F. The parameters characterising the pre-final population PK model are 
listed in Table 5. VPCs by dose of the pre-final model is shown in Figure 2. Similar results were 
obtained when the model was re-run once data after Week 16 became available; the final model.

The population PK model was developed based on data from three Phase 2 studies (PS0010, PS0011, 
and PS0016) and interim data from two Phase 3 studies (PS0008 and PS0009). 
The final popPK model was a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. 
Covariate effects included in the final model were body weight (WT), sex, race and anti-drug-
antibodies (ADAbs) status on apparent clearance (CL/F), and WT on apparent volume of distribution 
(V/F). Parameter estimates for the final popPK model are provided in table below.

Absorption  
Peak plasma concentrations (tmax) were achieved between 4 to 7 days following SC administration of 
bimekizumab to healthy volunteers. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a single subcutaneous dose of 320 mg in 
plaque psoriasis patients, bimekizumab reached a median (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) peak plasma 
concentration of 25 (12 -50) μg/mL, between 3- and 4-days post dose. 
Based on simulated data, the median (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) peak and trough concentration at 
steady-state following subcutaneous administration of 320 mg every 4 weeks are 43 (20-91) µg/mL 
and 20 (7-50) µg/mL respectively and steady-state is reached after approximately 16 weeks with 
every 4 weeks dosing regimen. Compared with exposure after a single dose, the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis showed that patients exhibited a 1.74-fold increase in peak plasma 
concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) following repeated four weekly dosing. 
After switching from the 320 mg every 4 weeks dosing regimen to 320 mg every 8 weeks dosing 
regimen at week 16, steady-state is achieved approximately 16 weeks after the switch. Median (2.5th 
and 97.5th percentile) peak and trough plasma concentrations are 30 (14 -60) μg/mL and 5 (1-16) 
μg/mL respectively. 
•  Bioavailability  
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 49/220 
 
 
 
 
Study RA0124 was an open-label, parallel-group, single-dose absolute bioavailability study 30 
healthy subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (10 subjects per group): bimekizumab 
80mg SC, 160mg SC, and 160mg IV. 
When compared with the parenteral bimekizumab 160mg IV dose, the bimekizumab 80mg and 160mg 
SC doses had absolute bioavailabilities of 0.656 (95% CI: 0.539, 0.798) and 0.631 (95% CI: 0.511, 
0.780), respectively. This is consistent with the result of the popPK analysis CL0453 (bioavailability of 
70.1%).  
•  Bioequivalence 
In  early  Phase  1  studies,  an  formulation  was  used  instead  of  the  formulation  used  in  the  remaining 
studies. 
Study UP0031 
This was an open-label, parallel group, single-dose study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 
bimekizumab 160 mg SC in healthy study participants administered as 2x80 mg (N=6) or 1x160 mg 
(N=6). 
The GeoMeans for AUC were similar between the bimekizumab 2x80mg (Formulation A) and 1x160mg 
(Formulation B) treatment groups (653.8day*μg/mL and 628.3 day*μg/mL, respectively). A similar 
Cmax was observed between the bimekizumab 2x80mg and 1x160mg treatment groups (GeoMeans of 
21.29μg/mL and 18.20μg/mL, respectively). The relative BA of bimekizumab Formulation B vs 
Formulation A was 96.1% (95% CI: 72.7, 127.0%); suggesting no clinically relevant differences 
between both formulations and processes. 
The population PK analysis that combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 data (CL0485) included data collected 
from  studies  that  used  and  studies  that  used.  However,  the  process  was  not  specifically  tested  as  a 
covariate in the analysis. In its response to the day 120 LOQ, the Applicant provided additional data that 
demonstrated  similar  PK  across  the  investigational  medicinal  product  used  in  Phase  2  and  Phase  3 
studies. 
In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the bimekizumab-True North (TN) device presentation was used 
for  administration.  For  commercial  use,  the  applicant  developed  2  different  device  presentations: 
bimekizumab-SS-1mL  (safety  syringe)  and  bimekizumab-AI-1mL  (auto-injector).  The  conduct  of  a 
bridging BE study UP0033, as part of the applicant‘s comparability strategy, was previously agreed in 
CHMP  scientific  advices.  UP0033  was  a  three-arm  single  dose  study  in  healthy  volunteers  comparing 
exposure  after  subcutaneous  administration  of  320  mg  bimekizumab  with  3  different  devices.  Both 
bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL were bioequivalent to bimekizumab-TN, as the 95% CI 
for the ratios of AUC, AUC(0-t), and Cmax were fully included within the acceptance range of 80% to 
125%.  
Studies DV0002 and DV0006 (see section 2.5.2) investigated the impact of self-injection and 
injection sites (thigh, abdomen) on the bimekizumab PK and did not suggest clinically relevant 
differences. Dose administration was allowed in the thigh, abdomen, or the upper arm in the pivotal 
phase 3 studies.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (V) ranged from 4.2 to 5.8 L following single dose IV administration of 
8-640 mg bimekizumab in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis (study UP0008). The apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F) following a single SC dose of 80mg or 160 mg bimekizumab to healthy 
subjects was 8.655 L and 10.15 L, respectively (study RA0124). In the population PK analysis 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 50/220 
 
 
 
(CL0485), V/F was estimated to 11.2 L (IIV 30.5%) for a typical subject with psoriasis weighing ~90 
kg. 
Elimination 
Terminal elimination half-life ranged from 19 to 26 days (median values) in healthy study participants. 
In the population PK analysis (CL0485), apparent clearance (CL/F) was estimated to 0.337 L/day (IIV 
32.7%) and the model-predicted half-life was 23 days. 
As a monoclonal antibody, bimekizumab is not expected to undergo significant renal or hepatic 
elimination. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Phase 1 studies 
Bimekizumab exhibited linear PK with dose-proportional or approximately dose-proportional increases 
in systemic exposure in the following Phase 1 clinical trials: UP0008, PA0007, RA0124 and UP0042. 
In Study UP0008, 26 subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis were randomized to single IV doses of 
bimekizumab (8, 40, 160, 480, or 640mg). Exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax increased with 
increasing dose in a linear fashion and was dose proportional between 8mg and 640mg (Table 7). 
Table 7 – Dose proportionality for PK parameters of UCB4940 (Analysis Set: PK Per protocol 
Set) 
Phase 2 studies 
In the Phase 2b study (PS0010), bimekizumab was administered SC Q4W for 12 weeks at doses of 
64mg, 160mg, 320mg loading dose at baseline followed by 160mg, 320mg, and 480mg. The observed 
plasma concentrations of bimekizumab at Week 1 and Week 12 at different doses are shown in Table 
8. These data indicate a dose proportional increase in plasma concentrations following SC 
administration in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Table 8 – Summary of bimekizumab plasma concentrations at Week 1 and Week 12 in 
PS0010 (PK-PPS) 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

Time dependency 
Phase 3 clinical studies 
In the Phase 3 studies (PS0008, PS0009 and PS0013) bimekizumab trough concentrations increased in 
a linear fashion and appeared to achieve steady state between Week 12 and Week 16. Trough plasma 
concentration accumulations between Week 4 and Week 16 were 1.57-1.65 and 1.54 for bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W and Q4W/Q8W, respectively. 
Population PK analysis (CL0485) 
Based on simulated data, steady-state is achieved by Week 16 on a Q4W regimen and subjects on 
320mg Q4W followed by a 320mg Q8W regimen achieved a new steady-state 16 weeks after the 
switch. The mean accumulation ratio for Q4W dosing in a typical patient with psoriasis was 1.74. The 
overall accumulation ratio for all simulated subpopulations receiving 320mg Q4W was 1.67. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
No information was provided on intra-individual variability. In the population PK analysis (CL0485), the 
estimated inter-individual variabilities of apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution 
(V/F) were moderate, with a CV% of 32.7% for CL/F and 30.5% for V/F. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
A comparison of PK following single doses of bimekizumab indicated no apparent differences between 
healthy subjects and subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis (Table 9).

healthy study participants and study participants with moderate to severe PSO 
Immunogenicity 
Phase 2 clinical studies 
In the Phase 2 studies (PS0010, PS0011, PS0016, and PS0018), the overall incidence of ADAb was 
between 1.9% and 38.8%. The earliest time point at which ADAb were observed was 4 weeks post first 
dose, which was the first post-baseline time point at which ADAb were measured. The majority of 
ADAb were seen at 1 time point. In PS0010 and PS0016, only 2 study participants had their PK 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

impacted by the presence of ADAb. In a population PK analysis (CL0466), combining data from PS0010 
and PS0016, ADAb status was not included as a covariate on clearance in the final model. The 
immunogenicity results from PS0018 suggested no risk for increased immunogenicity upon 
retreatment with bimekizumab. 
Phase 3 clinical studies 
Treatment-emergent ADAb occurred as early as 4 weeks post first dose at the earliest sampling time 
point, and cumulative counts increased over time. There was a tendency for higher incidences of ADAb 
in study participants receiving lower doses of bimekizumab (i.e., <160mg) and in study participants 
who switched from receiving bimekizumab 320mg Q4W to Q8W at Week 16 compared with study 
participants receiving bimekizumab 320mg Q4W continuously. 
The overall incidence of ADAb in the pooled Phase 3 studies was 22.6% during the Initial Treatment 
Period and 37.6% and 45.1% following 1 year of treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W switching to Q8W at Week 16, respectively. The PK of bimekizumab was 
impacted in the presence of ADAb, with slightly lower bimekizumab plasma concentrations observed in 
ADAb-positive study participants. This is in line with an 8% higher apparent clearance of bimekizumab 
in ADAb-positive compared with ADAb-negative study participants, as shown by population PK analysis 
(CL0485). Simulations based on the final population PK/PD model (CL0485) indicated that ADAb status 
had negligible impact on PASI100 and IGA0/1 response rates. 
The overall incidence of NAb-positive study participants in the pooled Phase 3 studies following 1 year 
of treatment was 14.6% in the group receiving bimekizumab 320mg Q4W throughout and 15.6% in 
the group switching from bimekizumab 320mg Q4W to bimekizumab 320mg Q8W at Week 16. In all 
studies, the majority of participants were positive for both IL-17AA and IL-17FF. The PK of 
bimekizumab was impacted in the presence of NAb, and this impact was larger than the impact of 
ADAb positivity on PK. 
Special populations 
•  Renal and hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the 
PK of bimekizumab. As a mAb, the renal elimination and metabolism of bimekizumab is expected to be 
low and of minor importance. Hence, no dose adjustments are proposed in renally or hepatically 
impaired patients. 
•  Gender 
In the population PK analysis (CL0485), gender was found to be a statistically significant covariate on 
CL/F, with females predicted to have approximately 10% greater CL/F compared to males. This 
difference was not considered to be clinically meaningful. Hence, no dose adjustment is proposed. 
•  Race 
Study UP0042 
This  study  evaluated  the  PK  of  bimekizumab  following  single  SC  doses  of  80mg,  160mg,  320mg 
bimekizumab in healthy Japanese (N=24; 6 study participants per dose) and Caucasian (N=24; 6 study 
participants per dose) subjects. 
The results indicated that the PK of bimekizumab was linear and dose proportional in Japanese and 
Caucasian healthy study participants in the tested dose range. The dose- and body weight-normalized 
PK of bimekizumab was generally similar between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The point 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 53/220 
 
 
 
estimates of the Geo LSMean ratios of dose-normalized AUC and Cmax were approximately 1 (1.014 
and 1.140, respectively) [90% CI ranged from 0.91-1.25). The point estimates of the Geo LSMean 
ratios of dose-normalized and body-weight normalized AUC and Cmax were both approximately 1 
(0.9017 and 1.014) [90% CI ranged from 0.81-1.1). 
Population PK and PKPD analysis (CL0485) 
The popPK model found that race was a statistically significant covariate on CL/F (Asian/Japanese 
study participants had 22% higher CL/F than non-Asian/Japanese study participants). However, 
Asian/Japanese subjects had typically lower body weights compared to non-Asian/Japanese, which is 
likely to compensate for faster clearance in this group. 
Based on simulations using the popPK model, the impact of race on exposure was not considered to be 
clinically meaningful. The impact of race on clinical response (PASI and IGA), based on simulations 
using the PK/PD model, was also not considered to be clinically meaningful (Figure 4 and Figure 8).

Figure 5 – Boxplots of the simulated IGA response rate versus race categories at Week 56 
Based on the overall data, no dose adjustment is proposed in terms of race. 
•  Weight 
The population PK analysis (CL0485) indicated that both CL/F and V/F of bimekizumab change with 
bodyweight (median of 87.0kg [range: 40.1-237kg]). Compared to a typical patient (~90 kg kg), 
patients weighing 120kg are expected to have Cav which is 30% lower and patients weighing 200 kg 
are expected to have Cav which is 60% lower. Similarly, a 60kg subject is expected to have 50% 
higher Cav and 40% higher Cmax, compared to a typical subject. 
Figure 6 and Figure 7 present the results of the simulations based on the population PKPD model 
(CL0485) for PASI and IGA, respectively, with 2 dose regimens (i.e. continuous 320mg Q4W and 
320mg Q4W up to Week 16 followed by Q8W) for non-Asian male patients, stratified by different 
weight categories. These show that the median model-predicted PASI90, PASI100 and IGA0/1 
responder rates overlap at body weights lower than 120kg and then start diverging. This indicates that 
some patients with body weight ≥120kg may benefit from the Q4W regimen in the Maintenance Phase.

•  Elderly 
In the population PK analysis (CL0485), bimekizumab CL/F and V/F were not impacted by age. The 
median age of the subjects was 44 years (ranging from 18–83 years). 110 of the 1348 patients 
included in the analysis were ≥65 years (8.2%) and 14 were ≥75 years (1.0%). No dose adjustment is 
proposed. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Interactions

No DDI studies were conducted. Although direct DDIs between therapeutic proteins and small 
molecules have not been reported, there is the possibility that cytokines or cytokine modulators may 
indirectly modify the metabolism of small molecules that are substrates for CYP enzymes and/or 
transporters. 
A limited effect on the exposure of CYP substrates following treatment with bimekizumab is 
anticipated. Therefore, the applicant considered that current diligence to monitor the exposure of 
narrow therapeutic index drugs such as warfarin should suffice. This has been reflected in section 4.5 
of the SmPC. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Based on simulated data, median (2.5th and 97.5th percentile) peak and trough concentrations at 
steady-state following sc administration of 320mg Q4W are 43μg/mL (20-91μg/mL) and 20μg/mL (7-
50μg/mL), respectively, and steady-state is reached after approximately 16 weeks with Q4W dosing 
regimens. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Clinical responses (PASI and IGA) were used as PD assessments throughout the development of 
bimekizumab (no other PD or PD biomarker analyses outside of efficacy assessments were conducted). 
Mechanism of action 
Bimekizumab is a humanized, full-length monoclonal antibody (mAb) of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
subclass with 2 identical antigen binding regions that potently and selectively bind and neutralize IL-
17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF cytokines. 
Primary pharmacology 
PS0010 
A statistically significant and clinically relevant difference in PASI90 responder rate at Week 12 was 
observed for bimekizumab-treated study participants compared with placebo-treated study 
participants. Maximum clinical response on PASI90 responder rate was achieved at 320mg Q4W. A 
further increase in dose would not be expected to provide additional clinical benefit. No clinically 
relevant difference was observed in the PASI90 responder rate at Week 12 between the bimekizumab 
160mg and 160mg w/LD groups. 
PS0011 
Week 12 PASI90 non-responders in the placebo group quickly achieved improvements with 
bimekizumab treatment in PS0011, which were maintained over 48 weeks. Week 12 PASI90 non-
responders in the bimekizumab group who continued to receive bimekizumab experienced 
improvements. Week 12 PASI90 responders in the bimekizumab group maintained improvements 
throughout the study. 
PS0016 
Bimekizumab was administered to study participants as follows: 
•  Bimekizumab 320mg+placebo: bimekizumab 320mg administered sc at Baseline and Week 4, 
and placebo administered at Week 16 (N=32) 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 57/220 
 
 
 
•  Bimekizumab 320mg: bimekizumab 320mg administered sc at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 16 
(N=17) 
Maximum PASI100 responder rates were achieved across all study participants at Week 12 (ie, 8 
weeks after the second dose in the study) and loss of response had begun by Week 16 (ie, 12 weeks 
after the second dose in the study) indicating dosing intervals greater than Q8W would result in loss of 
PASI response. 
PS0018 
The PASI responder rates (PASI100, PASI90, PASI75, and PASI50) steadily increased from Week 0, 
followed by a plateau through Week 48/Withdrawal (WD) Visit, and a decrease at the SFU Visit. 
PASI100 responder rates reached 46.5% at Week 12, PASI90 responder rates reached 79.1% at Week 
8, PASI75 responder rates reached 88.4% at Week 4, and PASI50 responder rates reached 95.3% at 
Week 4. The IGA responder rates steadily increased from Week 0 (18.6%) through Week 4 (62.8%) 
and Week 8 (79.1%), then plateaued through Week 48/WD Visit (79.1%), followed by a decrease at 
the SFU Visit (51.2%). 
No PD analyses (outside of efficacy analyses) were conducted in PS0008, PS0009 and PS0013. Please 
see Clinical Efficacy section for details. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Bimekizumab is a mAb and is not expected to interact with the hERG channel. A thorough QT/QT 
interval corrected (QTc) clinical study has therefore not been conducted. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Study UP0034  
This was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, single-dose study to evaluate the 
effectiveness of influenza vaccination following concomitant exposure to a single dose of bimekizumab 
(320mg) administered SC in healthy subjects (18-55 years of age). After measurement of antibody 
titers at Baseline, study participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either bimekizumab 
320mg (N=28) or no treatment (N=28). Inactivated influenza vaccine was administered 
intramuscularly 2 weeks after the dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP)/no treatment. 
There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants exhibiting a seroconversion 
response between the bimekizumab 320mg group and the group of participants who received no 
treatment prior to their vaccination.

Table 10 – Primary analysis: Proportion of participants exhibiting a seroconversion response 
4 weeks post vaccination (PD-PPS) 
There were no observed differences between the 2 groups for any of the 4 influenza serotypes of 
vaccine-specific antibodies. Within each individual influenza serotype, the influenza antibody geometric 
mean titers were generally similar between the 2 groups at all time points. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Population PK/PD analysis CL0466  
The population PKPD model was developed using combined data from 2 Phase 2 studies (PS0010 and 
PS0016) in adult subjects with moderate to severe adult plaque psoriasis. The aim was to perform 
simulations to inform the dose and dosing regimen/s to use in the Phase 3 clinical studies. 
All data up to Week 16 were used to develop the “pre-final” PKPD model that was used to perform the 
dosing simulations. The parameters characterising the pre-final model are listed in Table 11. Results of 
the VPC from the pre-final PKPD model by dose level are shown in Figure 8Figure 9.

Figure 10 – Visual predictive check by dosing regimen 
Simulations indicated that doses above 320mg Q4W may not provide a clinically relevant increase 
(>10 percentage points) in PASI90 or PASI100 responder rates at Week 16 (Figure 5:22). However, 
the 320 mg dose provides a greater than 10 percentage points benefit on PASI90 and PASI100 
compared to 160 mg dose. The simulations also indicated that a loading dose at baseline may not 
impact PASI90 or PASI100 response at Week 16. For the maintenance period, simulations indicated 
that a Q4W regimen is likely to maintain PASI75, PASI90 and PASI100 response, whilst patients on 
both Q8W and Q12W are likely to lose PASI90 and PASI100 response. 
Population PKPD analysis CL0485 
This analysis was based on the data from three Phase 2 studies (PS0010, PS0011, and PS0016), and 
interim data from two Phase 3 studies (PS0008 and PS0009). Population PKPD models were developed 
to describe the bimekizumab exposure-response relationships for PASI and IGA. 
PASI model 
The final population PKPD model for PASI was a bounded integer model with a placebo effect model, 
described with maximum placebo effect (PLmax), and a treatment effect maximum effect (Emax) 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 60/220 
 
 
 
 
model of bimekizumab average concentration (Cav) over the dosing intervals. Covariates included in 
the model were baseline body weight (WT), region and baseline PASI score on Emax, and age and 
region on EFhalf. However, body weight was the only clinically relevant covariate that impacts PASI90 
and PASI100 response rates.  
The parameter estimates of the final exposure-response model for PASI are presented in Table 12. 
Figures below present the categorical VPC for PASI response rate versus Cav deciles at Week 16 and 
Week 56, respectively.

IGA model 
The final population PKPD model for IGA was a bounded integer model with a mono-exponential time-
dependent placebo effect described by PLmax and time to reach half maximum placebo effect (PLhalf). 
Bimekizumab exposure response was described with an indirect response model with stimulation of 
zero-order production rate constant (Kin) using an Emax effect model of bimekizumab Cav over the

dosing intervals. Covariates in the model were baseline IGA score on first-order removal rate constant 
(Kout), and baseline WT and Asian/Japanese race on concentration at half maximum effect (EC50). 
The parameter estimates of the final PKPD model for IGA are presented in Table 13.  
Figures below present the categorical VPC for IGA response rate versus Cav deciles at Week 16 and

majority of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis subjects.

Q4W and 320mg Q4W up to Week 16 followed by Q8W) with regards to PASI75, PASI90 and IGA0/1 
were negligible at Week 56 for a typical patient. The differences were slightly larger for PASI100 and 
IGA0 response (Figure 17 and Figure 18).

Dose-exposure-safety of bimekizumab 
This analysis was based on pooled safety data collected while on blinded bimekizumab from Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies. TEAEs by bimekizumab trough concentrations quartiles at Week 52 or 56 are 
summarised in Table 14. A trend was observed towards higher Candida infection rates in the higher 
plasma concentration quartiles. 
Table 14 – TEAEs during the combined initial and maintenance treatment period by week 
52/56 bimekizumab trough concentration quartile (Pool S2A) 
An inverse relationship for the risk of Candida infections with body weight was observed, particularly 
for oral candidiasis, with higher incidences reported in the lower weight categories. The applicant 
considered that this could potentially be due to lower concentrations of bimekizumab in heavier 
subjects compared to lower body weight subjects.  
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 66/220 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional analyses demonstrated that, while a higher exposure is expected in lower-weight patients, 
this has minimal clinical relevance as any concentration-driven effect on oral candidiasis is weak 
(Figure 18). Further, the vast majority of oral candidiasis cases were mild or moderate and did not 
lead to discontinuation. This observation includes oral candidiasis cases experienced by study 
participants <70kg. While the overall impact of dose adjustment on the risk profile is limited, a dose 
lower than the current proposed posology may result in loss of benefit in lower-weight patients. Hence, 
the current proposed posology provides the most favourable benefit/risk profile across the broadest 
range of the target population of adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (PSO), including 
lower-weight patients. 
This is further discussed in section 2.4.4 ‘Discussion on clinical pharmacology’.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
The three PK methods are considered validated in accordance with the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical 
method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1).  
The overall approach to measuring immunogenicity is in line with the recommendations of EMA 
Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 
1) and EMA Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo 
clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010). For both the ADA and NAb assays, sufficient details have 
been provided on the cut-point determinations. Details of assay precision, sensitivity, range, 
selectivity, and drug tolerance have been provided and are considered acceptable to the CHMP. The 
drug tolerance of the assays was investigated and the serum concentration of bimekizumab was below 
the assay tolerances. No effect from target interference on the detection of anti-drug antibodies 
(ADAb) and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (Nab) was observed. The validated target concentrations 
in the ADAb and Nab assays are expected to cover anticipated IL-17AA and IL-17FF levels in study 
participant samples from the reported clinical studies.

Population PK analyses 
In each of the three population PK analyses (CL0453, CL0466 and CL0485), the methods used for 
model development and evaluation are considered acceptable to the CHMP.  
CL0453 
Bimekizumab PK were adequately described by a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination. The absolute bioavailability of SC administration was estimated to be 70.1% (CV 45.9%), 
which is comparable to that estimated from RA0124 data based on non-compartmental analysis. 
CL0466 
This popPK model was developed using pooled data from two Phase 2 clinical studies (Phase 2B study 
PS0010 and the Phase 2A study PS0016). The final model was a one-compartment model with linear 
absorption and elimination. Weight was found to be a significant covariate on CL/F and V/F, indicating 
that patients with higher body weight may have reduced bimekizumab exposure. No other significant 
covariates were identified including race (Japanese vs Caucasian).  
All PK parameters of the pre-final model were estimated with good precision (Relative standard error 
(RSE) <23%). Shrinkage was acceptably low for CL/F and V/F (6.7% and 7.4%, respectively), but high 
for Ka (81.8%). Inter-individual variability (IIV) estimates were reduced compared to the base model. 
All Goodness of fits plots (GOF) plots showed that the model adequately described the observed 
bimekizumab concentrations. The Visual Predictive Check (VPCs) showed that the model captured the 
global trend and the variability of the concentration vs time data reasonably well. Therefore, the pre-
final population PK model is deemed adequate for simulations. 
The final model, based on all available data, is also deemed adequate, with similar parameter 
estimates to pre-final model. GOF and VPCs further support the adequacy of the model.  
CL0485 
This popPK model was developed using pooled data from three Phase 2 (PS0010, PS0011, and 
PS0016) and two Phase 3 studies (PS0008 and PS0009). The final model was a one-compartment 
model with first-order absorption and elimination. The applicant considered that the PK of 
bimekizumab in the target patient population was well characterised by a 1-compartment PK model 
with linear absorption and that all the model parameters were well estimated with adequate precision. 
Further, the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment could not be adequately estimated 
(RSE > 50%) with the 2-compartment model. The choice of a one-compartment rather than a two-
compartment model was considered to be adequately justified by the applicant. 
All PK parameters, both fixed and random effects, were estimated with good precision (all RSEs 
<25%). IIV shrinkage was low for both CL/F and V/F (2.6% and 11.5%, respectively). The GOF plots 
show that the model describes the observed data well. The VPCs suggest that the predictive 
performance of the model is adequate.  
Among the tested covariates, baseline body weight, sex, race and ADAb status were statistically 
significant covariates on CL/F, and body weight was a statistically significant covariate on V/F.   
Absorption 
•  Bioavailability 
The bioavailability of bimekizumab administered sc was assessed in healthy subjects in study RA0124 
using non-compartmental methods. The absolute bioavailability of the 80mg and 160mg dose of 
bimekizumab reported was similar with values of 0.656 (95% CI: 0.539, 0.798) and 0.631 (95% CI: 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 68/220 
 
 
 
0.511, 0.780), respectively. These values are comparable to the absolute bioavailability of SC 
administration (70.1%) estimated by population PK analysis.  
•  Bioequivalence 
Two formulations and three device presentations have been used during the development of 
bimekizumab. The relative bioavailability study UP0031 showed no clinically relevant difference 
between the early formulation and the formulation used in most of the studies. In addition, 
bioequivalence was demonstrated in study UP0033 between processes and devices used in the pivotal 
phase 3 studies (TN device) and those planned for commercialisation (bimekizumab safety syringe or 
auto-injector).  
No clinically relevant differences are expected after administration in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm. 
Rotated use of these injections sites as indicated in the SmPC section 4.2 is therefore endorsed by 
CHMP. 
Distribution 
The population estimate for the apparent V/F in patients with psoriasis is 11.2L, which is similar to V/F 
estimated in healthy subjects (8.7-10.2 L). The relatively small volume of distribution is typical of 
monoclonal antibodies, which are largely confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces due to their 
large molecular size and poor lipophilicity. 
Elimination 
The terminal elimination half-life of bimekizumab ranged from 19-26 days and was independent of 
dose. This half-life is consistent with non-specific (not target-mediated) elimination of human IgG by 
the reticuloendothelial system. 
The lack of specific excretion or metabolism studies is acceptable because bimekizumab is a protein 
which is primarily cleared by proteolytic catabolism and broken down into small peptides and individual 
amino acids. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In single-dose and multiple-dose studies, bimekizumab exhibited dose-independent linear PK. 
Simulated data based on the final popPK model indicated that steady-state is achieved by Week 16 and 
the accumulation ratio is ~1.7, which is consistent with the results of the Phase 3 studies. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
There were no apparent differences observed in bimekizumab PK between healthy subjects and 
subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity data were collected throughout the clinical development programme and the results 
were generally consistent across studies. 
The overall approach to measuring immunogenicity is in line with the recommendations of the EMA 
Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 
1) and the EMA Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo 
clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010).  
For both the ADA and NAb assays, sufficient details have been provided on the cut-point 
determinations. Details of assay precision, sensitivity, range, and selectivity have been provided and 
are considered acceptable to the CHMP. The drug tolerance of the assays was investigated and the 
serum concentration of bimekizumab was below the assay tolerances. Target interference levels were 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 69/220 
 
 
 
validated up to a 1:1 combined concentration of 4000pg/mL of IL-17AA and IL-17FF, respectively. No 
effect from target interference on the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) was observed. The 
validated target concentrations in the ADAb assay are therefore expected to cover all anticipated IL-
17AA and IL-17FF levels in study participant samples from the reported clinical studies. 
The PK of bimekizumab was altered by the presence of ADAb, with slightly lower bimekizumab plasma 
concentrations observed in ADAb-positive study participants. This is in line with an 8% higher apparent 
clearance of bimekizumab in ADAb-positive compared with ADAb-negative study participants 
determined in the population PK analysis (CL0485). Despite the impact on bimekizumab PK, ADAb 
positive status appears to have a very minor impact on clinical response rates (PASI100 and IGA0/1) 
according to simulations based on the final PKPD model (CL0485). 
The PK of bimekizumab was also impacted in the presence of NAb, and this impact was larger than the 
impact of ADAb positivity on PK. The Applicant assessed the impact of NAb as a covariate on CL/F in 
the final population PK model based on the final Phase 3 dataset. NAb status for IL-17FF binding was 
statistically significant. The model predicted NAb-positive subjects to have 16% higher CL/F. This 
increase in clearance was not considered to be clinically relevant since only 9% of the total population 
were both NAb positive for the IL-17FF binding. Further, model-predicted Cav using the legacy model 
(without NAb covariate) and the final model (with NAb covariate) were similar, suggesting minimal 
differences in efficacy. 
The ADAb and NAb analyses were updated with the immunogenicity data for the safety follow-up (SFU) 
Periods of PS0008, PS0009, and PS0013, which were ongoing at the time of the data cut-off date. 
When SFU samples were included, the overall incidences of ADAb- and NAb-positive subjects were 
similar to those reported in the initial submission.  
In summary, there were 2 additional ADAb-positive study participants (1 only positive at SFU) and 1 
additional NAb-positive study participant in the updated analyses compared with the initial submission. 
For all Phase 3 studies combined, the overall incidence of ADAb in study participants who switched 
from bimekizumab 320mg Q4W to Q8W after Week 16 was 45.1% with and without SFU samples. For 
all Phase 3 studies combined, the overall incidence of NAb-positive study participants in the group who 
switched from bimekizumab 320mg Q4W to Q8W at Week 16 was 15.6%, with and without SFU 
samples; corresponding to 34.2% (40 of 117) of ADAb-positive participants. 
The below information included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Immunogenicity 
Approximately 45% of plaque psoriasis patients treated with bimekizumab up to 56 weeks at the 
recommended dosing regimen (320 mg every 4 weeks up to Week 16 and 320 mg every 8 weeks 
thereafter) developed anti-drug antibodies. Of the patients who developed anti-drug antibodies, 
approximately 34% (16% of all patients treated with bimekizumab) had antibodies that were classified 
as neutralizing. No evidence of altered clinical response, or safety profile was associated with anti-
bimekizumab antibodies development. 
Special populations 
The conclusions on special populations are largely based on the testing of covariates (body weight, sex, 
race and ADAb status) in the popPK analysis.  
•  Renal and hepatic impairment 
The lack of dedicated studies in subjects with renal and hepatic impairment is justified. It is agreed that 
a dose adjustment in these patient populations is not warranted. 
•  Gender 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 70/220 
 
 
 
Despite a 10% higher CL/F in females compared to males determined in the population PK analysis, the 
difference  did  not  translate  into  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on  bimekizumab  exposure.  Therefore,  it  is 
agreed that no dosage adjustment is warranted in terms of gender. 
•  Race 
It  is  agreed  that  there  was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  bimekizumab  exposures  between 
Asian/Japanese and non-Asian/Japanese subjects after accounting for body weight. Simulations based 
on  the  final  PK/PD  model (CL0485)  indicated that  there  may  be  some  differences  in  clinical  response 
rates  particularly  for  IGA  response.  However,  upon  request  by  the  CHMP,  the  applicant  adequately 
justified  that the  apparent  effect  of  race  on  clinical response  is  not  clinically  relevant.  Therefore,  it  is 
agreed that a dose adjustment is not necessary in Asian/Japanese patients.  
•  Weight 
A strong impact of body weight (BW) on drug distribution and elimination was observed in the popPK 
model in addition to a strong effect on the two PD endpoints (PASI and IGA) according to the PK/PD 
models. Therefore, the applicant proposed that some patients (with an incomplete skin clearance at 
week 16) with BW ≥120kg may benefit from the Q4W regimen in the Maintenance Phase. This is 
supported by the PK/PD simulations. The recommendation for overweight patients in SmPC section 4.2 
is agreed by CHMP.  
The applicant did not propose a dose adjustment for patients of low BW (40-60 kg), despite an 
expected ≥50% higher Cav and ≥40% higher Cmax compared to a typical subject of ~90 kg. An 
inverse relationship between BW and oral candidiasis was observed with a higher incidence in the lower 
BW groups. However, the applicant conducted additional analyses in support of the current proposed 
dose regimen for lower weight patients. These showed that any concentration-driven effect on oral 
candidiasis is weak and a dose adjustment in lower weight patients will likely have a limited effect on 
the incidence of oral candidiasis. Further, efficacy data suggest that using a lower dose in lower weight 
patients may result in reduced efficacy. Finally, the majority of oral candidiasis cases were mild or 
moderate and did not result in treatment discontinuation. Therefore, the applicant’s position that the 
current proposed posology for bimekizumab (i.e. 320mg at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks 
thereafter) provides the most favourable benefit/risk profile in adult patients with moderate to severe 
psoriasis, including lower-weight patients, is supported by CHMP. The SmPC - Section 4.8 informs the 
prescriber about the slightly higher incidences of oral candidiasis in patients weighing <70kg (8.5% 
versus 7.0% in patients ≥70 kg). This is agreed by CHMP.  
•  Elderly 
It is agreed with the applicant that a dosage adjustment is not warranted in older patients. This has 
been adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.2. 
Interactions 
The lack of non-clinical DDI studies is acceptable to the CHMP. It is not expected that bimekizumab will 
directly interact with other drugs. The expected consequence of metabolism of biological products is 
degradation to small peptides and amino acids. As these processes typically have high capacity, they 
are not likely to be impacted by other co-administered medications. Further, any potential small 
molecule co-dosed with bimekizumab is unlikely to share the same elimination mechanisms as this 
antibody. 
As a cytokine modulator, however, bimekizumab may indirectly modify the metabolism of drugs by 
altering CYP expression. The applicant considers that bimekizumab would not be expected to have an 
impact on the exposure of drugs metabolized by the CYP system. It is agreed that the recommendation 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 71/220 
 
 
 
in Section 4.5 of the SmPC, to monitor the exposure of narrow therapeutic index drugs, is sufficient to 
mitigate any risk of a DDI.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
In the Phase 2b study PS0010, 5 sc doses of bimekizumab at Q4W for 12 weeks were studied: 64mg, 
160mg, 320mg loading dose at Baseline followed by 160mg thereafter, 320mg, and 480mg. The 64mg 
dose showed the lowest PASI90 response, and the response increased with increasing doses up to 
320mg Q4W. The 480mg dose did not result in a higher response rate than 320mg. Also, the loading 
dose did not show a clinically meaningful impact on PASI90 response at Week 12 compared to 160mg 
with no loading dose. 
The results from study PS0016 indicated that dosing intervals greater than Q8W would result in loss of 
PASI response. This was further supported by PASI90 data from the bimekizumab 320mg group 
(where a dose was received at Week 16), where maintenance of PASI90 response was achieved for a 
further 8 weeks following the Week 16 dose but reduced 12 weeks after dosing. 
These results support the selection of dosage regimens for the Phase 3 studies; 320mg Q4W up to 
Week 16 followed by either 320mg Q4W or 320mg Q8W as the maintenance regimen. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No secondary clinical pharmacology studies were conducted with bimekizumab. This is acceptable to 
the CHMP.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Study UP0034 aimed to verify the lack of interference of IL-17 blockade on the ability to produce 
clinically relevant influenza titers (defined as a ≥4 times Baseline levels) following a therapeutic dose 
of bimekizumab. The design and conduct of the study is acceptable. The results demonstrated non-
inferiority of bimekizumab versus placebo with respect to the immunogenic response to the influenza 
vaccine, based on the predefined non-inferiority margin of -40%. The conclusion that bimekizumab 
showed no effect on the immunogenic response to the influenza vaccine is agreed. The information 
included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC is considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect - Population PKPD analyses 
CL0466 
The aim of this PK/PD analysis, using pooled data from two phase 2 clinical studies (the Phase 2B 
study PS0010 and the Phase 2A study PS0016), was to determine a dose and dosing regimen for the 
Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with psoriasis.  
The methods used for development and evaluation of both the prefinal and final PK/PD models are 
acceptable. The pre-final model is deemed adequate for dosing simulations.  
The simulations indicated that for the initial dosing phase up to Week 16, a 320mg dose Q4W is likely 
to be the optimal dose. A loading dose did not appear to improve the clinical response. Between week 
16 and week 52, simulations suggested that a Q4W regimen should maintain response rates, while 
Q8W and Q12W regimens may lead to a loss of response. Nevertheless, both Q4W and Q8W regimens 
were selected for Phase 3 trials. Simulations also suggested that body weight does not have a 
significant impact on PASI response rate and, therefore, weight-based dosing was not selected for the 
phase 3 studies. The dose and dosing regimens selected for the Phase 3 studies appear reasonable. 
CL0485 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 72/220 
 
 
 
This population PKPD analysis was based on the data from three Phase 2 studies (PS0010, PS0011, 
and PS0016), and interim data from two Phase 3 studies (PS0008 and PS0009). 
A bounded integer model was used to describe the relationship between bimekizumab plasma 
concentration (Cav) and PASI and IGA over time. The model structures were different for PASI and 
IGA. The estimated half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) for PASI and IGA were higher when 
estimated over the first 16 weeks compared to over 56 weeks.  
Simulated PASI90, PASI100 and IGA0/1 response rates versus bimekizumab Cav deciles at Weeks 16 
and 56, respectively, support the proposed dosing regimen of 320 mg Q4W for the first 16 weeks 
followed by 320 mg Q8W thereafter for the majority of patients with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
Exposure-safety analysis 
The exposure-safety analysis suggested a positive relationship between Candida infection rates and 
bimekizumab exposure, which may explain the higher incidence of Candida infections observed in 
subjects in the lower body weight categories. However, additional analyses showed that any 
concentration-driven effect on oral candidiasis is weak and a dose adjustment in lower weight patients 
will likely have a limited effect on the incidence of oral candidiasis. This is accepted by the CHMP. Thus, 
no dose adjustment is deemed necessary for psoriasis patients with a lower body weight.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD profile of bimekizumab has been adequately characterised. Based on the PK-PD data 
presented in this application, the proposed posology of 320 mg (two 160 mg injections) Q4W followed 
by 320 mg administered every eight weeks for the majority of patients with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis as SC injection is agreed. For some patients with a body weight ≥ 120 kg who did not achieve 
complete skin clearance at week 16, 320 mg every 4 weeks after week 16 may further improve 
treatment response. Appropriate information relevant for the prescribers and patients has been 
included in the SmPC and package leaflet accordingly.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development programme included four Phase 2 studies to investigate dose-response, long-
term safety, PK, and PD: PS0010, PS0011, PS0016, and PS0018. The doses of bimekizumab studied in 
Phase 2 (ranging from 64mg to 480mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]), as well as the PK/PD modelling of the 
Phase 2 data, were used to support the decision for the initial and maintenance dosing regimens 
studied in the Phase 3 programme.  
Furthermore, three pivotal Phase 3 studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of 
bimekizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque PSO: PS0008 (BE SURE), PS0009 (BE 
VIVID), and PS0013 (BE READY). An interim safety cut of the ongoing Phase 3 open-label extension 
(OLE) study (PS0014) also contributed to the body of evidence supporting the safety evaluation for 
bimekizumab in this population.

Table 15: Studies evaluating efficacy of bimekizumab in adult study participants with 
moderate to severe plaque PSO 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The bimekizumab dose and dosing regimens tested in the Phase 3 studies were selected based on 
safety, efficacy, and PK data from the two Phase 2 studies (PS0010 and PS0016) in study participants 
with plaque psoriasis (PSO), as well as PK/PD analyses performed at the end of Phase 2b. 
The population investigated in the phase 2 dose finding studies was similar to those investigated in 
pivotal studies. The study enrolled adults patients with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score 
≥12 and Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by PSO ≥10%, an Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) 
score ≥3 on a 5-point scale, who were candidates for systemic psoriasis therapy and/or phototherapy.

In the study PS0010, 8-fold dose range was tested. Patients received either 64, 160, 320 and 480mg 
of bimekizumab administered subcutaneously (sc) at Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. The arm with an 
initial loading dose of 320mg followed by 160mg Q4W was also introduced in this study to investigate 
whether a loading dose may lead to a faster and/or increased efficacy. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 75/220 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PASI 90 at Week 12. The secondary efficacy variables were IGA 
response (Clear or Almost Clear with at least 2 category improvement from Baseline) at Week 12 and 
Week 8, PASI 90 response at Week 8, PASI 75 response at Week 12 and PASI 100 response at Week 
12.  
A total of 250 subjects were randomized to this study. The mean age of subjects was 44.3 years and 
similar as in the pivotal studies the majority of the subjects enrolled were white male. The mean body 
weight and mean BMI were 88.13kg and 29.531kg/m2, respectively.  
Based on the results of this study, the320mg dose Q4W is likely to be the optimal dose for the initial 
treatment period. For this dose the highest percentage of responses were reported for the primary 
endpoint (PASI 90-79.1% responders) as well as for the majority of secondary endpoints. The increase 
in the dose to 480 mg was not associated with increased efficacy.  
In addition, a loading dose did not appear to improve significantly clinical response. No clinically 
relevant differences between the bimekizumab 160mg and 160mg with Loading Dose groups were 
observed for PASI and IGA responder rates investigated in the study (with the exception of PASI100 at 
Week 12). 
In the study PS0016, subjects received either Bimekizumab 320mg administered sc at Baseline and 
Week 4, and placebo administered at Week 16 (in arm A) or Bimekizumab 320mg administered sc at 
Baseline and Weeks 4 and 16 (in arm B). The primary endpoint of this study was change from Baseline 
in PASI at Week 28. The percentage PASI and IGA responses at week 16 and changes over time in the 
percentage of responders (week 2- 36) were assessed as secondary endpoints in this study.  
At Week 28, mean changes and mean percentage changes from Baseline in PASI score were larger for 
the bimekizumab 320mg group (-19.74 points and -86.68%, respectively) compared with the 
bimekizumab 320mg+PBO group (-10.76 points and -62.07%, respectively). At week 16 there was no 
significant differences in the percentage of responses which was expected taking into consideration 
that up to week 16 the treatment in both groups was the same.  
In the study, patients received their treatment at baseline and at week 4 but not at week 8 and 12. For 
PASI 90, PASI 75 a loss of response had begun by Week 16 (i.e., 12 weeks after the second 320mg 
dose at Week 4 in the study). For PASI 100 and IGA score a loss of response was started earlier 
(around 8 weeks after the second 320mg dose at Week 4 in the study). Q4W and Q8W regimens were 
selected for Phase 3 trials, which according to the applicant is considered justified based on the 
presented results of PS0016 study.  
The dose selection is further supported by the PK/PD analysis which was performed using combined 
data from PS0010 and PS0016.  
The performed simulations indicated that in the Initial Treatment Period a 320mg Q4W was predicted 
to have a clinically meaningful benefit (≥10%) on both the PASI 90 and PASI 100 response compared 
to the 160mg dose with or without a loading dose. Doses greater than 320mg did not provide 
additional benefit indicating plateauing of efficacy at 320mg. 
Three different maintenance treatment regimens were evaluated using simulations, 320mg Q4W, 
320mg Q8W, and 320mg every 12 weeks (Q12W). Simulations from the PK/PD model showed that a 
Q8W regimen would maintain PASI 90 response in a majority of patients (85%) and a Q4W regimen 
would maintain response in all the study participants. A longer duration between the doses such as 
Q12W, would lead to study participants losing PASI 90 response. Thus, the recommended dose for 
adult patients with PSO is, as proposed by the applicant, 320 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections 
of 160 mg each) at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter. For some patients with a body

EMA/393532/2021  
Page 76/220 
 
 
 
weight ≥ 120 kg who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16, 320 mg every 4 weeks after 
week 16 may further improve treatment response.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The clinical development programme consisted in three randomised phase 3 studies to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of bimekizumab (PS0008, PS0009 and PS0013) in subjects with moderate to severe 
PSO. In this assessment report, Studies PS0008 and PS0009 will be presented together as many 
similarities between these two studies exist. Study PS0013 will be presented separately. Pooled results 
and results in pooled subgroups for the three main Phase 3 pivotal studies (PS0008, PS0009, PS0013) 
are discussed in the “Analysis performed across trials” sub-section.

Sample size 
Study PS0008 
A total of 450 subjects were to be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following treatment 
groups: 
•  Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W throughout the study (150 subjects) 
•  Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W (ie, bimekizumab 320mg Q4W until Week 16, then 
bimekizumab 320mg Q8W from Week 16 through Week 52 (150 subjects) 
•  Adalimumab 80mg administered as an initial dose, followed by 40mg Q2W starting 1 week 
after the initial dose until Week 24, then bimekizumab 320mg Q4W from Week 24 to Week 52 
(150 subjects) 
Study PS0009 
A total of 560 subjects were to be randomly assigned in a 4:2:1 ratio to the following treatment 
groups: 
•  Bimekizumab 320mg (320 subjects) 
•  Ustekinumab (160 subjects)

Placebo (80 subjects) 
Randomisation / Blinding (masking) 
An interactive response technology (IRT) was used for assigning eligible study participants to a 
treatment regimen based on a predetermined production randomization and/or packaging schedule 
provided by the applicant (or designee). The randomization schedule was produced by the IRT vendor.  
Study participant treatment assignment was stratified by region (North America, Western Europe, 
Central/Eastern Europe and Asia/Australia) and prior biologic exposure (yes/no). The IRT generated 
individual assignments for study participant kits of IMP, as appropriate, according to the visit schedule.  
These studies were double-blinded. Due to differences in presentation between the bimekizumab and 
the  active  comparators,  special  precautions  were  taken  to  ensure  study  blinding  and  study  sites  had 
blinded  and  unblinded  personnel.  Study  sites  were  required  to  have  a  written  blinding  plan  in  place, 
signed by the Principal Investigator, to ensure that the double-blind nature of the study is maintained. 
Sites were instructed to keep study subjects blind to the IMP as detailed in the site blinding plan. 
Due to obvious differences in schedule of IMPs administration and number of injections received at each 
visit patients were receiving also PBO injections so the blind could be preserved.

Analysis Populations 
PS0008 
The Enrolled Set (ES) consisted of all subjects who gave informed consent. 
The Randomized Set (RS) consisted of all randomized subjects. 
The Safety Set (SS) consisted of all subjects that received at least 1 dose of the IMP. Subjects in the 
SS were to be analysed according to the treatment they actually received. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of the 
IMP and had a valid measurement of each of the co-primary efficacy variables at Baseline. 
The Bimekizumab Set (BKZ Set) consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
bimekizumab in this study. 
The BKZ Week 24 Set consisted of all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of BKZ on or after 
Week 24. 
The Maintenance Set (MS) consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of active IMP 
(bimekizumab or adalimumab) in the Maintenance Treatment Period (at Week 16 or later). 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consisted of all subjects in the RS who had no important protocol 
deviations affecting the primary efficacy variables. Important protocol deviations were predefined and 
subjects with important protocol deviations were evaluated during ongoing data cleaning meetings 
prior to unblinding of the data. 
The Pharmacokinetics Per-Protocol Set (PK-PPS) consisted of all randomized subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of the IMP and provided at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration post-dose 
without important protocol deviations that would affect the concentration. 
Efficacy analyses were performed according to randomized treatment and not actual treatment 
received. 
PS0009 
As for PS0008, except the BKZ Set and BKZ Week 24 Set were not defined for this study. The following 
analysis population was additionally defined for study PS0009: 
The Active Medication Set (AMS) consisted of all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of active 
IMP (bimekizumab or ustekinumab). The AMS was to be used for summaries of safety that include all 
data from the initial Treatment Period and/or Maintenance Treatment Period. 
Analysis of co-primary endpoints – PASI 90 & IGA 0/1 at week 16 
PS0008 
The co-primary efficacy variables for this study were PASI 90 response and IGA response at Week 16, 
and the corresponding analyses were based on the RS. A subject was classified as a PASI90 responder 
if the PASI score at Week 16 had improved at least 90% from Baseline. An IGA responder was any 
subject with a score of 0 or 1 (Clear or Almost Clear) with at least a 2-category improvement from 
Baseline to Week 16 in IGA score. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 84/220 
 
 
 
The primary analysis used the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test where region and prior 
biologic exposure (yes/no) were used as stratification variables. 
For the assessment of non-inferiority, a non-inferiority margin of 10% was used and evaluated based 
on the confidence interval for the stratified Cochran Mantel-Haenszel risk difference between 
bimekizumab and adalimumab. To calculate the stratified Mantel-Haenszel risk difference, the method 
of Greenland and Robins (1985) was used. The Wald method was used to calculate the confidence 
interval. A non-inferiority margin of 10% was selected as this was considered to be a clinically relevant 
difference that could influence the choice of interventions used to treat chronic plaque PSO.  
The evaluation of superiority used pairwise treatment comparisons based on the CMH test using the p-
value for the general association. The odds ratio and associated confidence interval (CI) based on the 
Wald test were presented. If one of the treatment groups has 0 or very low response where CMH can 
no longer be used, the logit method was to be applied instead.  
For the assessment of non-inferiority of bimekizumab to adalimumab, the lower 97.5% confidence limit 
for the stratified Mantel-Haenszel risk difference was considered. If that value was greater than -10%, 
then non-inferiority would have been established. 
Non-responder imputation was used to account for missing data in the primary analysis. Specifically, 
any subject who withdrew from IMP prior to Week 16 or who had missing data for the co-primary 
efficacy variables at the Week 16 time point was considered as a non-responder. 
A number of sensitivity analyses for the co-primary efficacy variables were performed to evaluate the 
assumptions related to the handling of missing data, including: 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 85/220 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analysis 1 
Missing data were addressed using MI (Markov-Chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] method for intermittent 
missing data, followed by monotone regression for monotone missing data) to evaluate the effect of 
the method for handling missing data on the analysis. 
The actual PASI/IGA scores were imputed and then dichotomized to obtain the response status. The 
treatment differences for each imputed data set were subsequently evaluated using the stratified CMH 
test as used in the primary analysis. The results from each of the imputed data sets were combined for 
overall inference using Rubin’s rules.  
This procedure assumes a missing at random (MAR) pattern of missingness and corresponds to an 
estimand of the difference in outcome improvement if all subjects tolerated or adhered to treatment 
(Mallinckrodt et al, 2012). This is an estimand of efficacy to evaluate the de jure hypothesis. 
Sensitivity analysis 2 
This sensitivity analysis was based on observed data at Week 16. Subjects with missing data or who 
had prematurely discontinued IMP were to be treated as missing. The same stratified CMH test as in 
the primary efficacy analysis was to be used. 
PS0009 
As for PS0008, except the active comparator is ustekinumab rather than adalimumab. The following 
additional sensitivity analysis was conducted: 
Deviations from the MAR pattern assumed in sensitivity analysis 1 were evaluated. Intermittent 
missing data was imputed using MI based on the MCMC method but the remaining monotone missing 
data was assumed to follow a missing not at random (MNAR) pattern. These data were imputed using 
reference-based imputation in which the imputation model was based on data from placebo group, 
thereby assuming that monotone missing data follow a trajectory similar to the placebo group 
(Mallinckrodt et al, 2012). As in sensitivity analysis 1, actual PASI/IGA scores were imputed and then 
dichotomized to get the response status. The treatment differences for each imputed data set were 
subsequently evaluated using the stratified CMH test as used in the primary analysis.  
The estimand in this procedure is the difference in outcome improvement in all randomized subjects at 
the planned endpoint of the study attributable to the initially randomized medication (Mallinckrodt et 
al, 2012). This is an estimand of effectiveness to evaluate the de facto hypothesis. 
Analysis of ranked secondary endpoints  
PASI and IGA responses (PS0008 & PS0009) 
A stratified CMH test similar to the primary endpoint analysis was implemented. Missing data were 
imputed using NRI in the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses 1 and 2 above were conducted. 
For the assessment of non-inferiority in PS0009, a non-inferiority margin of 10% was used and 
evaluated based on the confidence interval for the stratified Mantel-Haenszel risk difference between 
bimekizumab and ustekinumab. 
Scalp IGA response (PS0009) 
Scalp IGA response at Week 16 was defined as clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a two 
category improvement from Baseline to Week 16. A stratified CMH test similar to the primary endpoint 
analysis was applied. Missing data were imputed using NRI in the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis 
1 and 2 above were performed. 
Patient Symptom Diary responses (PS0009) 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 86/220 
 
 
 
The PSD consists of 14 different items, each measuring an aspect of the psoriasis and its impact on the 
subject’s quality of life. Each item was scored separately on a 0-10 scale with 0 for no symptom and 
10 for very severe or worst symptom. Weekly averages were derived for each of the 14 items of the 
Psoriasis Diary up to Week 16. The weekly average was the sum of the scored item over the course of 
the study week divided by the number of days on which the item was completed. The weekly average 
value for each item was set to missing if four or more daily assessments (irrespective of whether these 
are consecutive or not) of that item were missing. The Baseline value was computed in the same 
manner. 
The PSD was computed based on the responder definition. 3 PSD items were included in the 
hierarchical testing procedure: itch, pain, and scaling. The response thresholds used for itch, pain, and 
scaling at week 16 were 2.39, 1.98, and 2.86, respectively. The responder analysis was limited to 
subjects with a Baseline PSD response score at or above the applicable threshold score. Stratified CMH 
test, similar to the primary efficacy analysis was applied for each of these responder analyses. Missing 
data for PSD responder variables were imputed using an MI procedure similar to sensitivity analysis 1 
for the co-primary efficacy variables. 
Subgroup analyses 
For both PS0008 and PS0009 
Subgroup analyses were performed on PASI75/90/100 response rates and IGA, using by visit 
summaries only. The following subgroups for analysis were determined using baseline data: 
•  Age (<40 years, 40 to <65 years, ≥65 years) 
•  Gender (male, female) 
•  Disease duration (<median, ≥median) 
•  Region (North America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Asia/Australia) 
•  Weight (≤100 kg, >100 kg) 
•  BMI (<25 kg/m2, 25 to <30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2) 
• 
• 
• 
Prior systemic therapy of any kind (yes, no) 
•  Baseline disease severity (PASI<20, PASI≥20) 
•  Antibody positivity (negative, positive) 
Prior systemic phototherapy or chemotherapy (yes, no) 
Prior biologic exposure (yes, no) 
Antibody positivity was the only subgroup that is not determined by Baseline data. It was presented in 
a separate table. 
Note: The definition of prior systemic therapy of any kind is that if a subject received previous biologic 
therapy, previous systemic therapy (non-biologic), or previous systemic chemotherapy or 
phototherapy. Subjects who never received previous biologic therapy, previous systemic therapy (non-
biologic), or previous systemic photochemotherapy or phototherapy were classified as not receiving 
prior systemic treatment for psoriasis.

In addition, in order to assess whether an early response to treatment is predictive of response at later 
time points, subgroup analyses were performed for the RS on PASI90/100 and IGA over time using the 
following early response subgroups: 
• 
• 
PASI75 responders (OC) at Week 4 (yes, no) to predict PASI90/100 and IGA (NRI) through 
initial and maintenance treatment period 
PASI90 responders (OC) at Week 16 (yes, no) to predict PASI100 (NRI) through 
maintenance treatment period 
All summaries were based on imputed data as appropriate and included descriptive statistics only. 
Multicentre study 
PS0008 and PS0009 
The centre-by-treatment interaction was tested by replacing region with centre in the logistic 
regression model used for the sensitivity analysis and adding a centre-by-treatment interaction term. 
In the model, centre was based on the original centres prior to pooling. However, if the model was 
unable to converge due to a low number of subjects at a given centre, a pooling by centre was to be 
applied in order to allow the model to converge. If convergence still cannot be achieved, this analysis 
was not to be performed. 
Type I error control 
In each of studies PS0008 and PS0009, the statistical analysis of the co-primary efficacy variables and 
selected secondary efficacy variables accounted for multiplicity and controlled the familywise Type I 
error rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 by using a fixed sequence testing procedure. 
PS0008 
The hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11 and H12) comparing bimekizumab vs. 
adalimumab were tested at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05. 
The first 2 hypotheses (H1 and H2) tested whether bimekizumab is non-inferior to adalimumab for the 
co-primary efficacy variables, PASI90 response at Week 16 and IGA response at Week 16. This 
evaluation of non-inferiority was tested at a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 based on a 1-sided 97.5% CI 
and a non-inferiority margin of 10%. If non-inferiority was achieved, the alpha was to be passed to the 
next test in the sequence, allowing the testing procedure to proceed. The co-primary efficacy variables 
of PASI90 response at Week 16 and IGA response at Week 16 were then to be evaluated for 
superiority relative to adalimumab at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, and testing was to proceed only if 
superiority was achieved for both endpoints. 
The hypotheses associated with the subsequent secondary efficacy endpoints were based on testing for 
superiority relative to adalimumab. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 88/220 
 
 
 
 
 
PS0009 
The hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, H16, H17 and 
H18) comparing bimekizumab vs. placebo or bimekizumab vs. ustekinumab were tested at a 2-sided 
alpha level of 0.05.  
The first 2 hypotheses (H1 and H2) were to test whether bimekizumab is superior to placebo for 
PASI90 response and IGA response at Week 16. These are the hypothesis tests corresponding to the 
co-primary endpoints. If both were rejected at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, that alpha was to be 
passed to the next test in the sequence, allowing the testing procedure to proceed. 
The hypotheses associated with the subsequent secondary efficacy endpoints were based on testing for 
non-inferiority/superiority relative to ustekinumab or for superiority relative to placebo. 
Note that while subjects randomized to ustekinumab may receive either the 45mg or 90mg dose 
(according to weight at Baseline), all subjects randomized to ustekinumab were analyzed as a single 
group (and not broken out by dose) since this strategy is consistent with the recommended weight-
based dosing for ustekinumab.

treatment for PSO to reflect changes in labeling and approved countries; removed references to PD 
assessments as they were not conducted in this study; updated the schedule of study assessments 
(Table 3-3) to include a hematology and biochemistry sample at Week 28, and to modify the visits at 
which the TB questionnaire, body weight, physical examination, and ECG were assessed; clarified that 
all visits from first dose to Week 24 would have a ±3 day visit window, while all visits from Week 28 to 
end of study would have a ±7 day window; modified exclusion criteria to exclude use of prohibited PSO 
medications; modified exclusion criteria pertaining to history of malignancy, systemic disease, and 
major depression; added new withdrawal criteria for non-responders and for study participants with 
newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); clarified withdrawal criteria for study participants 
with depression or suicidal ideation or behaviour; updated prohibited concomitant medications to 
include tildrakizumab and risankizumab; updated laboratory measurements to be performed; provided 
additional details for requirements for IMP rechallenge in the event of PDILI;dDefined a Bimekizumab 
Set as an analysis population; updated the sequence testing and analysis of secondary efficacy 
variables.  
Study PS0009 
The original PS0009 protocol (dated 15 August 2017) has undergone 4 global protocol amendments.  
Protocol Amendment 1 (19 September 2017) was implemented to remove the escape arm to allow for 
a 1-year comparison of bimekizumab versus ustekinumab that was not confounded by an escape arm 
at Week 16 and to remove the mandatory withdrawal at Week 28 or later. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (15 October 2017) added a new other efficacy variable (absolue and percent 
change from Baseline for IGAxBSA. It also removed the 30% enrolment limit for study participants 
with prior biologic exposure. 
Protocol Amendment 3 (06 April 2018) included the following modifications: updated the schedule of 
study assessments to include a hematology and biochemistry sample at Week 20, to modify the visits 
at which the TB questionnaire, body weight, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were 
assessed, and to modify the visits at which photographs were taken; clarified that all visits from first 
dose to Week 24 were to have a ±3 day visit window, whileall visits from Week 28 to end of study 
were to have a ±7 day window; added new withdrawal criteria for non-responders and for study 
participants with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease; provided additional details for 
requirements for IMP rechallenge in the event of potential drug-induced liver injury (PDILI); updated 
the sequence testing.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study PS0008: Co-primary endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints were met. The bimekizumab total group was superior compared with the 
adalimumab group for the co-primary endpoints of PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response rates at Week 16. 
The differences were statistically significant and clinically meaningful for both co-primary endpoints, 
with odds ratios versus adalimumab of 7.459 (p<0.001) and 4.341 (p<0.001), respectively.

Study PS0008: Co-primary endpoints at Week 16: Randomised set (NRI) 
Study PS0008: Key secondary endpoints 
The bimekizumab total group had a higher PASI100 response rate compared with the adalimumab 
group at Week 16 (60.8% vs 23.9%, respectively; p<0.001) and Week 24 (66.8% vs 29.6%, 
respectively; p<0.001), a difference that was statistically significant and clinically meaningful at both 
time points. In addition, the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group demonstrated a statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful superior PASI100 response rate compared to the adalimumab group at Week 
24 (67.7% vs 29.6%, respectively; p<0.001).

PASI75 at Week 4 
The bimekizumab total group had a higher PASI75 response rate compared with the adalimumab group 
at Week 4 after one dose of bimekizumab (76.5% vs 31.4%, respectively; p<0.001), which was a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference. 
In the BE SURE study at week 24, a significantly higher percentage of patients treated with 
bimekizumab (Q4W/Q4W and Q4W/Q8W combined dosing arms) achieved PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 
responses as compared with adalimumab (85.6% and 86.5% respectively vs 51.6% and 57.9% 
respectively, p<0.001). At week 56, 70.2% of patients treated with bimekizumab Q8W achieved a 
PASI 100 response. Among the 65 adalimumab non-responders at week 24 (< PASI 90), 78.5% 
achieved a PASI 90 response after 16 weeks of treatment with bimekizumab. The safety profile 
observed in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab without a wash-out period was 
similar to patients who initiated bimekizumab after wash out of prior systemic therapies. 
Study PS0009: Co-primary endpoints 
Treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically superior 
response rates for the co-primary efficacy variables (PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response at Week 16), and 
all secondary efficacy variables in the statistical hierarchy compared with both placebo and 
ustekinumab.

Study PS0009: Key secondary endpoints 
PASI 100 and IGA 0 at Week 16 
The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group also had a higher PASI100 response rate compared with the 
ustekinumab group at Week 16 (58.6% vs 20.9%, respectively; nominal p<0.001) and a higher IGA 0 
response rate compared with the ustekinumab group at Week 16 (58.6% vs 22.1%, respectively; 
nominal p<0.001) which were statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences.  
PASI75 at Week 4 
The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group had a higher PASI75 response rate compared with the placebo 
and ustekinumab groups at Week 4 after only a single dose of bimekizumab (76.9% vs 2.4% and 
15.3%, respectively; p<0.001 for both comparisons), differences that were statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful. 
The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group had higher PSD response rates based on pain, itch, and scaling 
item scores compared with the placebo group at Week 16, differences that were statistically significant 
(77.3% vs 16.7%, 76.6% vs 13.1%, and 78.5% vs 12.7% respectively; p<0.001 for all comparisons).  
The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group also had slightly higher PSD response rates based on pain, itch, 
and scaling item scores compared with the ustekinumab group at Week 16 (77.3% vs 68.2%; nominal 
p=0.053; 76.6% vs 65.8%; nominal p=0.035, and 78.5% vs 59.5%; nominal p<0.001, respectively)

PS0013 
Methods  
PS0013 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a 
16-week Initial Treatment Period followed by a 40-week Randomized-Withdrawal Period to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with moderate to severe chronic 
plaque PSO. 
Study participants initially randomized to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W were re-randomized 1:1:1 to 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W, bimekizumab 320mg Q8W, or placebo (ie, treatment withdrawal).

All study participants initially randomized to placebo who achieved a PASI90 response at Week 16 
continued to receive placebo (Q4W). 
All study participants who relapsed at Week 20 or later during the Randomized-Withdrawal Period (up 
to Week 56) were allocated to the escape arm.  Relapse was defined as not achieving a PASI75 
response. Study participants who achieved a PASI50 response at Week 12 of the open-label escape 
arm were allowed to enroll in PS0014.

Sample size 
Approximately 400 study participants were to be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to the following 
treatment groups: 
•  Bimekizumab 320mg (approximately 320 study participants) 
• 
Placebo (approximately 80 study participants) 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the comparison of bimekizumab to placebo for the co-
primary efficacy variables of PASI90 response and IGA 0/1 response at Week 16. The assumed 
response rates for PASI90 at Week 16 were 75% and 2% for bimekizumab and placebo, respectively.  
Additionally, the assumed response rates for IGA 0/1 response were 85% and 5% for bimekizumab 
and placebo, respectively. The assumed response rates for bimekizumab were based on the Phase 2b 
PS0010 data. The power to show statistical superiority of bimekizumab relative to placebo under these 
assumptions was >99% for the co-primary endpoints. 
A total of 435 study participants were randomized and started the study as follows: 349 study 
participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and 86 study participants in the placebo group. 
An interim analysis after final week 56 visit was performed, and the final updated CSR was provided 
once all of the SFU visits were collected. 
At the Week 16 study visit, study participants who achieved a PASI90 response entered into the 
Randomized-Withdrawal Period. Study participants initially randomized to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
were re-randomized 1:1:1 to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W, bimekizumab 320mg Q8W, or placebo (ie, 
treatment withdrawal). All study participants initially randomized to placebo who achieved a PASI90 
response at Week 16 continued to receive placebo Q4W. A total of 312 study participants included in 
the Week 16 Responder Set (WK16Res) started the Randomized-Withdrawal Period, including 106 
study participants in the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W/Q4W group, 100 study participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W group, 105 study 
participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/placebo group, and 1 study participant in the 
placebo/placebo group. 
Study participants who did not achieve a PASI90 response at the Week 16 study visit and all study 
participants who relapsed at Week 20 or later during the Randomized-Withdrawal Period (up to Week 
56) were allocated to the escape arm. A total of 182 study participants included in the Escape Study 
Participant Set (ESS) started the Escape Treatment Period. Three study participants in the Escape 
Treatment Period were ongoing in the study as of the clinical cutoff date. 
Duration of treatment: For each study participant not entering escape treatment, the study was 
planned to last a maximum of up to 77 weeks, as follows: 
-Screening Period: 2 to 5 weeks 
-Double-blind, placebo-controlled Initial Treatment Period: 16 weeks 
-Double-blind, placebo-controlled Randomized-Withdrawal Period: 40 weeks 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 123/220 
 
 
 
-Escape treatment (if required): 12 weeks 
Safety Follow-Up Period: an SFU Visit is planned 20 weeks after the final dose of IMP (for study 
participants not enrolling in the open-label study) 
Randomisation 
Essentially the same as for studies PS0008 and PS0009  
At Week 16, subjects who received bimekizumab Q4W during the Initial Treatment Period may be re-
randomized to a new treatment group based on their PASI response.  
Blinding (masking) 
Essentially identical as for studies PS0008 and PS0009. 
Statistical methods: 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The original SAP, dated 30 August 2018, was amended once. Amendment 1 of the SAP, dated 16 
September 2019, was implemented to align the SAP with both Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 06 April 
2018) and Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 21 May 2019), as well as to achieve consistency with other 
SAPs of the bimekizumab PSO development program. Amendment 1 also clarified the handling of 
participants who entered the Escape Treatment Period without meeting the escape criteria, or who met 
the criteria but did not enter the Escape Treatment Period prior to study unblinding. 
The interim CSR is a complete analysis of the first 56 weeks of the study (including the 16-week Initial 
Treatment Period and 40-week Randomized-Withdrawal Period) based on a clinical cut-off date of 18 
October 2019. The date of database lock and unblinding was 18 October 2019. 
The results presented in the PS0013 final CSR provide a complete analysis of data collected through 
Week 56 of the study, including the 16-week Initial Treatment Period, the 40-week Randomized-
Withdrawal Period, the 12-week Escape Treatment Period, and the complete 20-week SFU Period. After 
the data cutoff date for the interim CSR, an additional 6 study participants completed unscheduled or 
SFU visits and 3 study participants were ongoing in the Escape Treatment Period, and these data were 
included in the final CSR. 
Analysis Populations 
As for PS0008, except the BKZ Set, BKZ Week 24 Set and MS Set were not defined for this study. The 
following analysis populations were additionally defined for study PS0013: 
The Escape Subject Set (ESS) consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of escape 
bimekizumab 320mg treatment either due to not achieving a PASI90 response at Week 16 or 
experiencing a relapse after entering the Randomized-Withdrawal Period. Summaries based on the ESS 
were split between subjects who enter the escape arm: 1) due to PASI90 non-response at Week 16 or 
2) due to relapse during the Randomized-Withdrawal Period (after achieving PASI90 response at Week 
16). 
The Week 16 Responder Set (WK16ResS) consisted of all subjects who achieved a PASI90 
response at Week 16 and had received at least 1 dose of the IMP during the Randomized-Withdrawal 
Period at Week 16 or later. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 124/220 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Active Medication Set (AMS) consisted of all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of active 
IMP (bimekizumab). The AMS was used for summaries of safety that included all data from the Initial 
Treatment Period and/or Randomized-Withdrawal Period. 
Analysis of co-primary endpoints – PASI 90 & IGA 0/1 at week 16 
As for PS0008, except there was no active comparator in this study and consequently no testing for 
non-inferiority. 
The additional sensitivity analysis described for PS0009 was also conducted for PS0013. 
Analysis of ranked secondary endpoints  
As for PS0009. 
Subgroup analyses 
As for PS0008. 
Multicentre study 
As for PS0008, except a pooling by region was to be applied if convergence was not achieved when 
pooling by center.

Type I error control 
The statistical analysis of the co-primary efficacy variables and selected secondary efficacy variables 
accounted for multiplicity and controlled the familywise Type I error rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 
0.05 by using a fixed sequence testing procedure. 
The hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9 and H10) comparing bimekizumab vs. placebo 
were tested at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05. 
The first 2 hypotheses (H1 and H2) tested whether bimekizumab is superior to placebo for PASI90 
response and IGA response at Week 16. These are the hypothesis tests corresponding to the coprimary 
endpoints. If both were rejected at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, that alpha was to be passed to the 
next test in the sequence, allowing the testing procedure to proceed. 
The hypotheses associated with the subsequent secondary efficacy endpoints were based on testing for 
superiority relative to placebo.

Study participants who did not achieve a PASI90 response at Week 16 of the Initial Treatment Period 
and all study participants who relapsed at Week 20 or later during the Randomized-Withdrawal Period 
(up to Week 56) received open-label bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for 12 weeks (ie, escape treatment). A 
total of 182 study participants started the Escape Treatment Period  
Table 25 - Disposition and discontinuation reasons while on BKZ 320mg Q4W by treatment 
sequence before Escape Treatment Period entry – Escape Treatment Period (ESS) 
Protocol violations 
In the initial treatment period most study participants (97.9%) had no important protocol deviations. 
The incidence of important protocol deviations during the Initial Treatment Period was low overall and 
similar between the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (2.0%) and the placebo group (2.3%). The most 
common important protocol deviation was procedural non-compliance (1.1%), and the most common 
reason for procedural noncompliance was having a Week 16 Visit outside of the ±7-day window. 
Overall, few study participants (1.6%) were excluded from the PPS due to protocol deviations during 
the Initial Treatment Period, and the incidence of study participants excluded from the PPS was similar 
between treatment groups. Overall, few study participants (0.5%) were excluded from the PK-PPS due 
to protocol deviations during the Initial Treatment Period, and the incidence of study participants 
excluded from the PK-PPS was similar between treatment groups.

In the randomised withdrawal period, one study participant in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W 
group had an important protocol deviation of prohibited concomitant medication use.  
There were no important protocol deviations during the Escape Treatment Period. 
Recruitment 
First study participant enrolled: 05 Feb 2018. Last study participant completed: 18 Oct 2019 (based on 
the clinical cut-off date for this interim Clinical Study Report [CSR]) 
Data from the Safety Follow-Up (SFU) Period (20 weeks after the final dose of investigational medicinal 
product [IMP]) was provided upon request from CHMP (with the clinical cut-off date: 5 March 2020). 
As of the clinical cut-off date for this interim CSR, the RS, SS, and FAS each consisted of 435 study 
participants, including 349 study participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and 86 study 
participants in the placebo group. The majority of study participants were included in the PPS and PK-
PPS (98.4% each). 
Table 26 - Disposition of analysis sets (RS) 
Conduct of the study 
The original PS0013 protocol (dated 14 August 2017) has undergone 3 global amendments.  
Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 15 Oct 2017) was implemented before any study participants were 
enrolled. The withdrawal criterion that study participants who did not achieve a PASI50 response by 
Week 28 or later be withdrawn from the study was removed and the same assessor should have 
evaluated the study participant at each efficacy assessment.  
Protocol Amendment 2 (dated 06 Apr 2018) included: Modified exclusion criterion to clarify 
exclusion of study participants who participated in other studies of bimekizumab, other medications 
(systemic or topical), or devices; Modified exclusion criteria pertaining to history of malignancy, 
systemic disease, and major Depression; Added new withdrawal criteria for study participants with 
newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), participants with depression or suicidal ideation; 
Updated prohibited concomitant medications to include tildrakizumab and risankizumab; Provided 
additional details for requirements for IMP rechallenge in the event of potential drug-induced liver 
injury (PDILI). Clarified regions for analyses. 
Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 21 May 2019): Clarified that IGA 0/1 response was clear or almost 
clear with at least a 2-category improvement from Baseline; Updated the definition of PSD responder 
and clarified that the PSD response item scores included in the statistical testing procedure (pain, itch,

and scaling) were to be characterized in terms of the cumulative percent of study participants 
demonstrating a prespecified point improvement at Week 16. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and other Baseline characteristics are summarised in below tables.  
Table 27 - Baseline disease characteristics (RS) 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

The baseline characteristics were generally similar for study participants entering the Randomized-
Withdrawal Period (WK16ResS) and the Escape Treatment Period (ESS) compared with Baseline 
disease characteristics for the Initial Treatment Period (RS). 
Prior and concomitant diseases 
The majority (82.1%) of study participants in the SS reported a previous and ongoing medical 
condition at Baseline (Table 3.1.3.1). The most frequently reported conditions/diseases at Baseline 
were in the SOCs of Metabolism and nutrition disorders (32.9%), Vascular disorders (30.8%), and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (28.0%). The incidences of any previous and ongoing 
medical history conditions at Baseline by SOC were generally similar between the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W group and the placebo group. 
Overall, the most frequently reported medical history conditions at Baseline by PT were hypertension 
(28.7%), obesity (11.3%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (9.2%). The incidences of previous or ongoing 
medical history conditions at Baseline by PT were generally similar between the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W group and the placebo group. 
The incidence of prior corticosteroid use was lower in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (23.5%) 
compared with the placebo group (29.1%). 
The use of any past PSO medications and biological treatment was generally similar between the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (98.0%) and the placebo group (100%).

The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group was superior compared with the placebo group for the co-primary 
endpoint  of  PASI90  response  rate  at  Week  16  (90.8%  vs  1.2%,  respectively).  This  difference  was 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful, with an odds ratio of 496.318 (p<0.001). 
A summary of the co-primary analysis of PASI90 response at Week 16 is presented for the RS (NRI) in 
table below.

IGA 0/1 response rate at Week 16 
The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group was superior compared with the placebo group for the co-primary 
endpoint  of  IGA  0/1  response  rate  at  Week  16  (92.6%  vs  1.2%,  respectively).  This  difference  was 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful, with an odds ratio of 657.255 (p<0.001)

Sensitivity analyses of the co-primary efficacy variables 
The  results of  the  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  co-primary  efficacy  variables  were  supportive  of  the  co-
primary  efficacy  results.  When  PASI90  and  IGA  0/1  response  rates  were  analyzed  with  alternative 
missing data assumptions (MI using MCMC monotone or reference-based regression, OC, or LOCF), with 
additional  analysis  sets  (FAS  or  PPS),  and  an  additional  analysis  method  (logistic  regression),  the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group maintained higher PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response rates compared with 
the placebo group (nominal p<0.001 for all comparisons). 
Additionally, there was no evidence that specific sites or regions were contributing disproportionately to 
the co-primary efficacy results.

When compared by individual treatment groups, a clinically meaningful difference in the PASI90 response 
rate was observed in study participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W/Q8W groups compared with study participants in bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/placebo group at Week 
56 (86.8% and 91.0% vs 16.2%, respectively; nominal p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Sensitivity analyses of the secondary efficacy variables 
The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  supportive  of  the 
secondary  efficacy  results.  When  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  analyzed  with  alternative  missing 
data  assumptions  (MI  using  MCMC  monotone  regression  or  OC),  the  bimekizumab  group  had  higher 
response rates for all secondary variables compared with the placebo group (nominal p<0.001 for all 
comparisons). 
Other efficacy analyses – Randomized-Withdrawal Period  
Across the spectrum of other efficacy endpoints measuring disease symptoms and severity 
(PASI, IGA, scalp IGA, BSA affected by PSO, IGAxBSA, pp-IGA, mNAPSI), study participants who 
remained on bimekizumab 320mg Q4W or Q8W maintained clinically meaningful improvements from 
Week 16 to Week 56 compared with study participants who were re-randomized to withdrawal from 
bimekizumab. Loss of clinical improvements generally became evident after 12 weeks of withdrawal 
from bimekizumab treatment (ie, after Week 24). 
Few study participants receiving bimekizumab relapsed during the study. Overall, there were no 
notable, consistent differences in the efficacy profile of maintenance treatment (ie, from Week 16 
through Week 56) with bimekizumab 320mg administered Q4W versus Q8W. 
No study participants experienced a rebound (defined as when a study participant experienced a ≥
25% increase from Initial Treatment Period Baseline in PASI score occurring within 2 months [60 days] 
of stopping therapy [ie, being re-randomized to placebo]). 
At Week 56, all subgroups had a clinically meaningful difference in the bimekizumab groups compared 
with the placebo group in PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response rates. It should be noted that the sample sizes 
for many of the subgroup categories in the subgroup analyses were relatively small; therefore, 
interpretation of these data should be made with caution. 
Patient-reported outcomes 
Consistent with treatment effect on clinical disease manifestations, at Week 16 of the Initial Treatment 
Period, the DLQI 0 or 1 rate was higher in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group compared with the 
placebo group (75.6% vs 5.8%, respectively; nominal p<0.001). 
During the Randomized-Withdrawal Period, the DLQI 0 or 1 rates were maintained from Week 16 to 
Week 56 in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W (83.0% to 76.4%, respectively) and bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W/Q8W groups (73.0% to 86.0%, respectively) but declined from Week 16 to Week 56 in 
the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/placebo group (79.0% to 19.0%, respectively).

Immunologic conclusions 
During the Combined Initial and Randomized-Withdrawal Period, the incidence of study participants 
who were ADAb positive at 1 visit or more was similar between the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W 
and bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W groups (52.1% vs 49.5%, respectively). 
In the bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/Q4W and bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/Q8W groups, the incidence of 
Baseline ADAb was low (3.2% each [3/94 and 3/93 study participants in the bimekizumab 320 mg 
Q4W/Q4W and bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/Q8W groups, respectively]). 
One study participant (1.1%) in the bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W/Q4W group and 2 study participants 
(2.2%) in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W group had boosted ADAb titers during the Combined 
Initial and Randomized-Withdrawal Period. 
The plasma concentration levels of bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and Q8W were reduced slightly at Week 
16 through Week 56 in study participants who were ADAb positive compared with those who were 
ADAb negative. 
Overall, ADAb status had no clear impact on efficacy in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group at Week 
16, or the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W groups at Week 56, as 
measured by PASI90, and IGA 0/1, and PASI100 response rates. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were conducted for PASI90 response, IGA 0/1 response, and PASI100 response 
across the following subgroups: age (<40 years, 40 to <65 years, ≥65 years); gender (male, female); 
duration of disease (<median [17.22] years, ≥ median [17.22] years); geographic region (North 
America, Western Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Asia/Australia); body weight (≤100kg, >100kg), 
BMI (<25kg/m2, ≥25 to <30kg/m2, ≥30kg/m2); prior systemic phototherapy or chemophototherapy 
(yes, no); prior systemic therapy (yes, no); prior biologic therapy (yes, no); Baseline PASI score (<20, 
≥20) and ADAb status (negative, positive). 
Due to the small sample size of some subgroups, results should be interpreted with caution. 
Consistent, clinically meaningful improvements in PASI90 response were observed for the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 16 across all subgroups. 
PASI90 response rates at Week 16 were generally similar across subgroups. Response rates in the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group were higher in Central/Eastern Europe (98.1%) compared with the 
remaining regions (range: 84.3% to 85.7%). 
Response rates in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group were higher in study participants weighing ≤
100kg (93.5%) compared with study participants weighing >100kg (83.0%).

Pooled efficacy results 
Pool E1 (Placebo controlled) 
Pool E1 (placebo-controlled) combined efficacy data from PS0009 and PS0013 to assess the response 
through Week 16. Results demonstrated that: 
-  Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated superior response rates compared with placebo for 
PASI90, IGA 0/1, PASI100, and IGA 0 at Week 16. Similar results were observed for all other 
efficacy outcome measures analyzed. 
- 
PASI90, IGA 0/1, and PASI100 response rates in the bimekizumab group at Week 16 were 
generally similar across subgroups. There were no notable differences in PASI90 or IGA 0/1 
responder rates in the key subgroups of disease severity (baseline PASI<20, PASI≥20) or weight, 
and no notable difference in PASI100 responder rates with disease severity (PASI<20, PASI≥20). 
The neutralizing antibody (NAb) status showed some differences at Week 16; however, no impact 
on efficacy was observed after longer exposure.

Pool E1 (Placebo controlled data to Week 16: Secondary endpoints (NRI) 
Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated higher response rates compared with placebo for PASI75 
response rate at Week 4 (76.4% versus 1.8%, respectively; nominal p<0.001. A clinically meaningful 
difference in PASI75 response rate was observed as early as Week 2. 
Treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W resulted in higher PSD response rates at Week 16 (nominal 
p<0.001) for pain, itch and scaling compared to placebo, based on the pre-specified response 
thresholds (pain ≥1.98, itch ≥2.39, and scaling ≥2.86. Results were consistent with data for the 
underlying individual studies (PS0009 and PS0013.  
A supportive sensitivity analysis for PSD response using a more stringent threshold of ≥4 in the 3 PSD 
items performed for Pool E1 confirmed the results of the prespecified main analysis (nominal p<0.001 
for all comparisons). Of note: PSD compliance was slightly higher in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
group.  
The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group had a higher scalp IGA 0/1 response rate compared with the 
placebo group at Week 16 (88.4% versus 11.0%, nominal p<0.001), differences that were clinically 
meaningful. A clinically meaningful difference in scalp IGA 0/1 response rate was observed as early as 
Week 1

Pool E1 (Study PS0009 & PS0013): Sensitivity analysis PSD results at Week 16 (NRI) 
In Pool E1, in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, the DLQI 0 or 1 rate increased rapidly through 
Week 8 and continued to increase steadily through Week 16. The DLQI 0 or 1 rate was higher in the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 1 through Week 16; with a 
clinically meaningful difference at Week 16 (nominal p<0.001). 
Mean Baseline PSD scores for pain, itch, and scaling were similar between the treatment groups. In the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, consistent improvements in the PSD item scores of pain, itch, and 
scaling were observed from Week 1 to Week 16, while no change was observed in the placebo group. 
In both Phase 3 studies that comprise Pool E1 (PS0009 and PS0013), treatment with bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W demonstrated marked improvements for both physician-assessed and patient-assessed 
signs and symptoms of PSO, which were rapid and sustained over time for the other efficacy variables. 
In Pool E1, bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated superior response rates compared with placebo 
for the efficacy endpoint of BSA ≤1 response rate at Week 16 (76.4% versus 0.6%, respectively; 
nominal p<0.001). A difference in the BSA response rate began as early as Week 2 (6.1% versus 0.6% 
for bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and placebo, respectively; nominal p=0.003) and a clinically meaningful 
difference was observed as early as Week 4 (25.7% versus 1.2% for bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and 
placebo, respectively; nominal p<0.001), consistent with other efficacy endpoints.

Pool E3 (Efficacy through Week 52 of Q4W bimekizumab dosing) 
Pool E3 combined data for study participants in PS0008 and PS0009 to investigate the efficacy of over 
1 year of continuous treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W. In Pool E3, there were 479 study 
participants. Overall, the Baseline characteristics in Pool E3 were similar to Pool E1 and Pool E2. The 
majority of study participants (88.9%) in Pool E3 completed Week 52 of the Maintenance Treatment 
Period. The primary reason for discontinuation was adverse event (5.2%). 
− Study participants rapidly achieved response for all primary (PASI90 and IGA 0/1) and secondary 
outcomes, and the response was sustained through Week 52.

Efficacy Pool E3: PASI90 response rate during the Initial and Maintenance Treatment Periods 
Efficacy Pool E3: IGA 0/1 response rate during the Initial and Maintenance Treatment Periods 
In Pool E3, DLQI 0 or 1 response rate increased quickly through Week 8 (57.0%) and continued to 
increase through Week 16 (65.6%). At Week 28 the response rate reached 74.8% and response was 
sustained at Week 52 (74.5%). 
Comparison of results in Pool E3 Subgroups 
Notable differences between subgroups included: 
•  PASI90, IGA 0/1, and PASI100 response rates were higher in Central/Eastern Europe 
compared with the other regions. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

Supportive studies 
Study PS0011 
A Multicenter, 48-Week, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Extension Study to 
Assess the Long-Term Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Bimekizumab in Adult Subjects with 
Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis. 
The PS0011 Extension Study to Assess the Long-Term Safety and enrolled patients who completed 
study PS0010 i.e. dose-response study. The primary objective of PS0011 study was to assess the long-
term safety and tolerability of bimekizumab. The assessment of efficacy was secondary and included 
investigation of changes in the PASI and IGA response over time. 
Subjects who were randomized to receive placebo or bimekizumab 64mg, 160mg, or 320mg loading 
dose + 160mg Q4W in PS0010 must have achieved PASI90 response at Week 12 in PS0010 to enter 
the PS0011 extension study on the same treatment dose. Subjects who did not achieve PASI90 
response at Week 12 in PS0010 while on these treatments were assigned to receive bimekizumab 160 
or 320mg Q4W at Baseline in PS0011 as follows: 
-  Subjects who were randomized to receive placebo and bimekizumab 64mg Q4W in PS001 were 
assigned to bimekizumab 160mg Q4W in PS0011. 
-  Subjects who were randomized to receive bimekizumab 160mg Q4W and 320mg loading dose 
+ 160mg Q4W in PS0010 were assigned to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W in PS0011. 
Subjects who were randomized to receive bimekizumab 320 or 480mg Q4W in PS0010 were assigned 
to receive bimekizumab 320mg Q4W on entering PS0011, regardless of their PASI90 response at Week 
12 in PS0010.  
217 patients were enrolled to this study.  As discussed above, PS0010 Week 12 non-responders were 
transferred to the higher dose of bimekizumab in this study. Subsequently the majority of these 
patients responded to treatment. The response was also seen in the initial non-responders who 
continue to receive the same dose in the extension study (320mg) or who were transferred from 480 
mg to 320 mg.  
It is noted that the majority of PS0010 Week 12 responses maintained their response throughout 
PS0011 study. It is noted however, that a small percentage of patients with the initial response to

Upon request from CHMP, the applicant provided a summary of the efficacy maintenance data available 
for PASI90 and IGA 0/1, including further data regarding effects on psoriatic nail disease, palmoplantar 
PSO, and effects on psoriatic scalp disease over time for the entire PS0014 study population as well as 
the subset of study participants previously treated with ustekinumab. In addition, a summary of 
antidrug antibody data over time was also provided. Those are presented below. 
PS0014 is an ongoing multicenter, open-label study to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of bimekizumab in eligible adult participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque PSO who 
completed one of the Phase 3 pivotal studies (PS0008, PS0009 or PS0013).  
The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of bimekizumab in study 
participants with moderate to severe plaque PSO. Secondary efficacy objectives included assessment 
of PASI 90 and IGA 0/1 responses over time.

As of the 01 June 2020 data cut-off, a total of 1286 participants were enrolled in study PS0014 and 
received bimekizumab treatment through Week 24 during the Treatment Period as follows: 903 
participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and 383 participants in the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q8W group. 
At Week 24, for participants receiving bimekizumab 320mg Q4W, if PASI90 was achieved, the 
Investigator was able to change the participant’s dosing interval from 320mg Q4W to 320mg Q8W 
(optional). A total of 131 participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group switched to bimekizumab 
320mg Q8W treatment at Week 24. 
As of the data cut-off, a total of 386 participants (30.0%) completed Week 48. The majority of 
participants remained ongoing in the study between Week 24 and Week 48 in the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W/Q4W group (60.8%), the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W group (67.2%), and the bimekizumab 
320mg Q8W/Q8W group (70.8%). 
Across the spectrum of efficacy endpoints, efficacy responses in participants treated with bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W reached similar levels to those treated with bimekizumab 320mg Q8W at approximately 
Week 12. These clinically relevant improvements from pivotal study Baseline and high levels of 
response were sustained on bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg Q8W treatment 
through Week 24 of PS0014. 
PASI90 response rate over time 
At PS0014 Baseline, the proportion of participants who had achieved PASI90 in the pivotal studies was 
lower in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (86.0%) compared with the bimekizumab 320mg Q8W 
group (99.2%) as a result of the study enrolment scheme. 
In the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, PASI90 response rates increased up to Week 12 (91.2%) and 
were sustained through Week 24 (89.2%). In the bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group, the high level of 
PS0014 Baseline PASI90 response rate was sustained at Week 12 (91.4%) and Week 24 (90.1%). 
IGA 0/1 response rate over time 
At PS0014 Baseline, the proportion of participants who achieved IGA 0/1 compared to pivotal study 
baseline was lower in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (87.5%) compared with the bimekizumab 
320mg Q8W group (96.9%). In the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, IGA 0/1 response rates were 
sustained from PS0014 Baseline up to Week 12 (89.1%) and were sustained at high levels through 
Week 24 (87.5%). In the bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group, the high level of PS0014 Baseline IGA 0/1 
response rate was sustained at Week 12 (90.6%) and Week 24 (88.3%). 
Other efficacy endpoints 
mNAPSI90 response rate over time 
Across all pivotal study / PS0014 treatment groups, the mNAPSI90 response rate at PS0014 Baseline 
(range: 23.1% to 78.2%) was either increased or sustained through Week 24 (range: 64.3% to 
89.5%). 
pp-IGA 0/1 response rate over time 
Across all pivotal study / PS0014 treatment groups, the pp-IGA 0/1 response rate at PS0014 Baseline 
(range: 66.7% to 100%) was either increased or sustained through Week 24 (range: 80.0% to 100%). 
Scalp-IGA 0/1 response rate over time 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 157/220 
 
 
 
Across all pivotal study / PS0014 treatment groups, the scalp-IGA 0/1 response rate at PS0014 
Baseline (range: 66.7% to 97.6%) was either increased or sustained through Week 24 (range: 72.0% 
to 96.0%). 
Across the spectrum of physician-assessed signs, symptoms, and impact of PSO efficacy endpoints, 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and Q8W treatment resulted in maintenance of clinically meaningful 
response rates up to Week 24 and Week 48. 
Efficacy in study participants previously treated with ustekinumab 
Study participants who received ustekinumab in the feeder study PS0009 were switched to 
bimekizumab treatment in PS0014; treatment allocation was based on PASI response as follows: 
•  Study participants who did not achieve PASI90 at the end of the feeder study received 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W in PS0014 
•  Study participants who achieved PASI90 at the end of the feeder study were randomized 1:1 to 
receive bimekizumab 320mg Q4W or bimekizumab 320mg Q8W 
There were 136 study participants treated with ustekinumab that completed study PS0009 and 
switched to bimekizumab treatment in PS0014. Of these, 39 study participants were allocated to 
receive bimekizumab 320mg Q8W and 97 study participants received bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
PASI90 response rate over time 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (n=96), the PASI90 response rate increased 
from PS0014 Baseline (55.2%) up to Week 12 (94.8%) and was sustained through Week 24 (90.6%). 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group (n=39), the PASI90 response rate was sustained 
from PS0014 Baseline (94.9%) up to Week 12 (97.4%) and through Week 24 (94.9%). 
IGA 0/1 response rate over time 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (n=96), the IGA 0/1 response rate increased 
from PS0014 Baseline (64.6%) to Week 12 (93.8%) and was sustained through Week 24 (87.5%). 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group (n=39), the high level of PS0014 Baseline IGA 
0/1 response rate (92.3%) was sustained at Week 12 (97.4%) and Week 24 (89.7%). 
Other efficacy endpoints 
mNAPSI90 response rate over time 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (n=63), the mNAPSI90 response rate increased 
from PS0014 Baseline (42.9%) through Week 24 (76.2%). 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group (n=19), the mNAPSI90 response rate increased 
from PS0014 Baseline (73.7%) through Week 24 (89.5%) 
pp-IGA 0/1 response rate over time 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (n=20), the pp-IGA 0/1 response rate was 
sustained from PS0014 Baseline (85.0%) through Week 24 (80.0%). 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group (n=11), the pp-IGA 0/1 response rate was 
sustained from PS0014 Baseline (100%) through Week 24 (100%). 
Scalp-IGA 0/1 response rate over time 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (n=76), the scalp-IGA 0/1 response rate 
increased from PS0014 Baseline (77.6%) to Week 24 (89.5%). 
In the ustekinumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group (n=29), the scalp-IGA 0/1 response rate was 
sustained from PS0014 Baseline (89.7%) through Week 24 (86.2%). 
Study participants who switched from ustekinumab to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W showed rapid 
improvement as early as the next assessment after PS0014 Baseline. Sustained responses were 
observed up to Week 24 at similar levels and over similar time courses compared with participants 
randomized to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W at Baseline. 
Self-administration of bimekizumab – Studies DV0002 and DV0006 
DV0002 and DV0006 are clinical use (study participant self-injection) studies conducted as part of the 
overall device presentation program to provide patients with flexible dosing options for bimekizumab. 
In DV0002 and DV0006, the safe and effective use of the bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-
1mL device presentations by study participants was evaluated at Baseline and at Week 8. Safe and 
effective self-injection was evaluated by the study personnel and was defined as complete dose 
delivery (confirmed by a visual inspection of the investigational device presentation), and no adverse 
device effects that precluded continued use of the investigational device presentation for self-injection 
(ie, no serious adverse device effects and/or adverse device effects [ADEs] that led to withdrawal).  
Both DV0002 and DV0006 met the primary and secondary objectives, and demonstrated that after the 
initial training at Baseline, study participants with moderate to severe plaque PSO could continue to 
safely and effectively self-inject bimekizumab using the bimekizumab SS 1mL or the bimekizumab AI 
1mL 8 weeks after training in the self-injection technique. 
Study participants reported positive self-injection experiences with the investigational device 
presentations, as assessed by the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire and scores on the visual 
analog scale for injection
site related pain were low following injection at Baseline and Week 8 with 
either the bimekizumab SS 1mL or bimekizumab AI 1mL device presentation. 
‑
In both substudies, the structural and functional integrity of the bimekizumab SS 1mL and the 
bimekizumab-AI-1mL was maintained post-injection and both device presentations performed as 
intended. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Bimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass with 2 identical 
antigen binding regions that bind and neutralize interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF cytokines.  
The applicant developed bimekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque PSO. 
The indication being sought is “Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
In support of the efficacy data for this application, the applicant presented data from three pivotal 
Phase 3 studies of bimekizumab use in adults who have plaque psoriasis (PS0008, PS0009 and 
PS0013).  
The development programme for bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque PSO was 
discussed with CHMP in two Scientific Advice procedures in May 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3306/1/2016/III) 
and in September 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3306/1/FU/1/2017/III).  
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 159/220 
 
 
 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal phase 3 studies recruited adult subjects who had a diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque 
PSO for at least 6 months. Subjects were required to be candidates for systemic therapy with a PASI 
score of ≥12 and an affected body surface area (BSA) of ≥10%. Subjects with other chronic 
inflammatory conditions (with the exception of psoriatic arthritis) were excluded.  
1480 subjects comprise the pooled Phase 3 randomised data set. The median age of subjects overall 
was 45 years (18 years, 83 years), 70.7% were male and 84.1% were white. 12.1% of subjects were 
Asian and 1.6% were black. The median weight was 87 kg (40.10 kg, 237.00 kg). 129 subjects (8.7%) 
weighed >120 kg. The median BMI was 28.730 (15.92, 73.15). The Median PSO disease duration was 
15.64 years (0.45, 67.45). 77.6% of subjects had a prior systemic treatment. 38.2% of subjects had a 
previous biological treatment exposure and 23% had a previous anti-IL-17 exposure. Just 0.3% had a 
prior primary failure to a biologic. 50% of subjects were recruited in Europe. The median BSA affected 
was 20% (10, 97). The median baseline PASI was 18.40 (11.7, 58.5). 66.4% of subjects were 
documented as having moderate PSO and 33.4% of subjects documented as having severe disease.  
Review of the baseline demographics revealed that the pivotal studies enrolled mostly male white 
subjects who were of higher weights. The patient demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
were, however, generally well-balanced across the various arms of trial. Approximately one third of the 
subjects were classified as having severe psoriasis and two thirds as having moderate psoriasis. The 
majority of patients were <65 years of age. Much lower numbers were between 65 to 84 years. The 
pivotal studies did not recruit any children or elderly (≥85 years) subjects. This is consistent with the 
disease profile and other similar PSO centralised applications. 
The bimekizumab dose and dosing regimens tested in the Phase 3 studies were selected based on 
safety, efficacy, and PK data from the 2 Phase 2 studies (PS0010 and PS0016) in participants with 
plaque PSO, as well as PK/PD analyses performed at the end of Phase 2. Based on this combination of 
clinical data and PK/PD analysis, a bimekizumab 320mg Q4W regimen was selected as the dose in the 
Initial Treatment Period up to Week 16 in all three Phase 3 pivotal studies.  
Both bimekizumab 320mg Q4W (all 3 pivotal studies) and bimekizumab 320mg Q8W (Studies PS0008 
& PS0013 only) were selected as the maintenance treatment regimens during the Maintenance 
Treatment Period/Randomized Withdrawal Period (Week 16 to Week 52/56).  
Study PS0008 was not placebo-controlled and adalimumab (a TNF inhibitor) was the active comparator 
however both Study PS0009 and Study PS0013 were placebo controlled. Study PS0009 also had an 
active comparator, ustekinumab (IL-23 inhibitor). The active comparators were administered according 
to their EU-authorised posologies in moderate-severe psoriasis. Study participants could have 
continued to use topical moisturizers or emollients, bath oils, or oatmeal bath preparations for skin 
conditions during the study, as needed. Mild and low potency topical steroids were permitted for use 
limited to the face, axilla, and/or genitalia, as needed. These topical medicines should not have been 
used within approximately 24 hours prior to study visits requiring IGA and PASI measures. 
All of the Phase 3 studies had the same co-primary efficacy endpoints, i.e. the proportion of 
participants who achieved a PASI90 response at Week 16 and the proportion of participants who 
achieved an IGA 0/1 response at Week 16. The Initial Treatment Phase for all 3 Phase 3 studies was 
16 weeks with a follow-up Maintenance Treatment Period to Week 56/52, respectively (Studies PS0008 
and PS0009) or a Randomized Withdrawal Period to Week 56 (Study PS0013). There were minor 
differences between the three pivotal studies with respect to secondary and other endpoints but all 
were considered appropriate.  
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 160/220 
 
 
 
The sample size calculations for the pivotal studies were based on the co-primary efficacy endpoints 
measured at week 16. The underlying assumptions of the sample size calculation is reasonable. The 
planned enrolment targets were achieved for the three pivotal studies. 
Upon request by the CHMP, the applicant provided further details on GCP findings. FDA inspections 
took place at two sites in studies PS0008 and PS0013. No findings were issued according to the 
Applicant. Health Canada conducted an inspection of PS0008; 12 findings were issued and corrective 
actions were implemented. Therefore, the CHMP concluded unlikely that the GCP findings would have 
had any significant impact on the efficacy or safety results submitted. 
The pivotal studies had a high completion rate, 95.6% of subjects completed the primary endpoint 
assessment of Study PS0008 with 0.2% discontinuing due to lack of efficacy. 94.7% of subjects 
completed the primary endpoint assessment of Study PS0009 with 0.5% discontinuing due to lack of 
efficacy. In Study PS0013, 97.0% of subjects completed Week 16 with 0.7% of subjects discontinuing 
due to lack of efficacy. 93.1% and 91.8% of subjects completed the Maintenance Treatment Period in 
Studies PS0008 and PS0009 respectively. In the Randomised Withdrawal Study (PS0013), 4.2% of 
subjects discontinued the study during the withdrawal period, none of these discontinuations were due 
to lack of efficacy. 
The Patient Symptom Diary (PSD), investigating symptoms of pain, itch and scaling as reported by 
patients, was developed by the applicant and discussed in a CHMP SA. The PSD consists of 14 items, 
which are scored on a 0 to 10 scale, with a higher score meaning greater severity or impact and with 
verbal anchors at the extreme responses and has a recall period of the last 24 hours. It was not 
submitted yet for regulatory acceptance but, according to the applicant, has undergone thorough 
development and psychometric validation. The PSD was assessed as an ‘other endpoint’ in study 
PS0008 and as a secondary endpoint in studies PS0009 and PS0013, and results are presented in the 
SmPC. Upon request by the CHMP, the applicant submitted an extensive PRO dossier detailing the 
progressive development of the PSD starting in phase 2 studies through phase 3 studies. Based on the 
information provided by the applicant, the CHMP agrees that PSD is a relevant patient reported 
outcome measure in the context of the assessment of bimekizumab effects in PSO patients on specific 
PSO symptoms of pain, itch and scaling affecting the quality of life of most patients. Although not a 
general assessment of health related quality of life in treated patients, it is less generic than the DLQI 
and in accordance with the EMA PSO guideline, the assessment of HRQL scales specific for PSO, in 
conjunction with the investigator’s assessed efficacy measures, is considered to represent an added 
value for a new medicine in comparative clinical trials. In follow up analyses on phase 3 trial data using 
a more conservative approach and mainly based on anchor based methods (different from the anchors 
used for the phase 2 study data), a more stringent responder definition of 4 points for all PSD items 
(on a 10 point scale) was selected to represent marked clinically meaningful improvement. Based on 
the totality of data presented by the applicant, the more stringent 4 point responder definition is 
agreed by the CHMP and found clinically meaningful to patients and healthcare providers. 
Overall, the design of the studies and endpoints chosen are in line with EMA guidelines and previous 
centralised authorisations for biological therapies for use in plaque psoriasis. Overall, the design of the 
Phase 3 studies is adequate and in line with the CHMP scientific advices received. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All three pivotal studies met their co-primary endpoints at Week 16. Integrated efficacy analyses were 
conducted for 3 distinct efficacy pools. 
Study PS0008 was designed to demonstrate superiority over Adalimumab.  
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 161/220 
 
 
 
PASI 90 at week 16 was 39% higher compared to Adalimumab and IGA 0/1 at week 16 was 28.1% 
higher versus Adalimumab. Both co-primary endpoints at Week 16 were highly statistically significant 
demonstrating superiority over adalimumab with p<0.001. Additionally, superiority was demonstrated 
on all secondary endpoints at week 24 (PASI 90, IGA0/1, PASI 75, PASI 100) and at week 56 for PASI 
90 and IGA 0/1, p<0.001. 
Study PSO009 was designed to demonstrate superiority over Placebo and Ustekinumab. 
PASI 90 response at week 16 for Bimekizumab was superior to both placebo (80.2% difference) and 
versus Ustekinumab (35.3% difference). Also, for IGA 0/1 response superiority was demonstrated 
79.3% better than placebo and 30.7% better than Ustekinumab. 
Similar to Study PS0008 both co-primary endpoints at Week 16 were highly statistically significantly 
better p<0.001. Additionally, superiority was demonstrated on all secondary endpoints at week 16 
(PASI 100, IGA 0, PSD responses for pain, Itch and scaling, Scalp IGA 0/1) and at week 52 for PASI 90 
and IGA 0/1, p<0.001. 
Study PS0013 was designed to demonstrate superiority over Placebo. 
PASI 90 at week 16 was 89.6 % better and IGA 0/1 was 91.4% better versus placebo. 
Similar to previous studies PS0008 and PSO009 both co-primary endpoints at Week 16 were highly 
statistically significantly better (p<0.001). 
Additionally, superiority was demonstrated on all secondary endpoints at week 16 (PASI 100, IGA 0, 
PSD responses for pain, Itch and scaling, Scalp IGA 0/1) and at week 52 for PASI 90 and IGA 0/1, 
p<0.001. 
Maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated at week 56, PASI 90 was 88.8% at week 56, (90.1% at week 
16). Difference from placebo was 72.6% p<0.001. 
Regarding anti-drug antibody positivity following retreatment, within the range of dose regimens 
studied, retreatment did not appear to impact efficacy. For multiple retreatments, the only data 
available are from PS0016 and PS0018, which suggest that efficacy is not impacted if bimekizumab 
treatment is interrupted more than once. 
In addition, a post-hoc analysis of PS0013 data showed that only 4 study participants became ADAb 
positive for the first-time following retreatment with bimekizumab, out of the 67 who were retreated. 
The applicant considered that these data demonstrate a very low increase in observed ADAb positive 
study participants following retreatment with no observed impact on efficacy. Nevertheless, it cannot 
be excluded that lower efficacy may become an issue over time if a higher number of patients became 
anti-drug antibody (ADAb) positive. Thus, this will be followed up in the post marketing setting as part 
of ongoing study PS0014 where their impact on safety will be further investigated. 
Overall the studies showed a consistent effect in IGA0/1 response and PASI 90, 100 response with 
treatment. Also, superiority was demonstrated over both Adalimumab and Ustekinumab.  
The applicant pooled the efficacy results in 3 separate pooled analyses. 
Pool E1 reflected a placebo-controlled Initial Treatment Period to Week 16 (Studies PS0009 & PS0013). 
Pool E2 reflected the Maintenance Treatment Period (Studies PS0008, PS0009 & PS0013). Pool E3 
reflected the Initial & Maintenance Treatment Periods for a Q4W regime (ITT) and included data from 
Studies PS0008 & PS0009.   
Results from these studies/pools demonstrated that: 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 162/220 
 
 
 
- 
Treatment with bimekizumab demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically superior 
response rates compared with placebo, adalimumab, and ustekinumab for the co-primary 
efficacy variables, 90% or greater improvement from Baseline in the PASI score (PASI90) and 
IGA of clear or almost clear (IGA 0/1) response at Week 16. 
-  Bimekizumab treatment was superior to placebo or comparator across all ranked secondary 
endpoints. Following treatment with bimekizumab, improvements for both physician-assessed 
and patient-assessed signs, symptoms, and impact of PSO were rapid and sustained over time. 
- 
Initial bimekizumab 320mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) treatment effects were rapid (75% or greater 
improvement from Baseline in the PASI score [PASI75] achieved after a single dose) and 
profound (complete PSO clearance demonstrated by PASI100 and IGA 0). 
- 
Initial treatment responses achieved at Week 16 were well maintained in the bimekizumab 
groups across all efficacy outcome measures compared with placebo and ustekinumab through 
1 year. 
- 
In the Maintenance Treatment Period, efficacy results through Week 56 were similar for both 
the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) treatment 
groups following initial treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for 16 weeks. 
-  Statistically significant differences in symptom relief were observed by subjects (PSD responses 
based on pain, itch, and scaling item scores at Week 16). 
-  Study participants who switched from placebo to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W at Week 16 
showed rapid improvement as early as the next assessment after Week 16 across the spectrum 
of other efficacy endpoints. Sustained responses were observed up to Week 52 at similar levels 
and over similar time courses compared with study participants randomized to bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W at Baseline. 
-  Consistency of treatment effect for the primary efficacy variables across the three studies was 
seen. 
-  Some geographical differences in response to bimekizumab were noted but these relate to 
differences in clinical practice, rather than reflecting a true difference in efficacy. 
- 
Placebo responses in Studies PS0009 and PS0013 were consistent with other psoriasis trials. 
Pooled efficacy data - Subgroup analyses 
E1 pool subgroup analyses - (placebo-controlled data to Week 16) 
In the E1 subgroup analyses presented, some inconsistency in certain subgroups (age, gender and 
baseline PASI ≥20) when PASI90 and IGA 0/1 responses are compared were noted. The applicant 
considered the subgroups of age, gender and Baseline PASI ≥20 to be consistent when PASI90 and 
IGA Clear (0) or almost clear (1) (IGA 0/1) response rates are compared. When comparing the PASI90 
and IGA0/1 response rates across the categories within each subgroup, no differences >3% were 
observed. Thus, CHMP agreed that the responses across the identified sub-groups are generally 
consistent. No subgroup analysis has been presented for subjects weighing <120 kg or ≥120 kg for the 
Initial Treatment Phase (placebo-controlled data to Week 16). The posology in patients ≥120 kg is 
discussed below. 
Further, CHMP considers that it is difficult to form any concrete conclusions regarding the “previous 
PSO treatment” subgroup data presented by the applicant. Previous treatment with phototherapy or 
chemotherapy may imply a more favourable response to bimekizumab, whereas previous treatment 
with an anti-TNF agent may not. However, examination of the “prior biologic exposure” subgroup 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 163/220 
 
 
 
suggested no difference in response to bimekizumab. Efficacy would be expected in patients who were 
not previously treated with a therapy which have a similar mechanism of action.  
Upon request by CHMP, the applicant presented a post-hoc subgroup analysis with regards to prior 
biologic failure. Across the key endpoints (PASI90, IGA 0/1, and PASI100), similar Week 16 responses 
were observed in study participants with or without prior biologic failure. Although similar results are 
seen, it is noted that the information is limited with a small number of subjects in the “Prior biologic 
failure” sub-group of the combined pool and is derived from a post-hoc analysis. Nevertheless, this 
issue was no longer pursued by CHMP. The following information has been added in SmPC section 5.1: 
Efficacy in patients with primary failure to anti-IL17 has not been investigated. 
The subgroup analyses also suggested that subjects from Western Europe had less favourable results 
than those from Central and Eastern Europe, however, it is unclear if this is a true effect or reflects 
differences in regional medical practice. This is acknowledged however it was considered that it is 
unlikely that different effect would be expected and therefore was not further pursued.  
Analysis of pool E1 data at week 16 showed a lower treatment response in the NAb+ population 
(n=30) compared to the overall ADAb- population (n=607) for PASI90, IGA 0/1 and PASI100 
responses (e.g. PASI90; 70% vs 89%). Upon request by CHMP, post-hoc analysis of treatment 
response at Week 52 was performed on the 30 study participants from Pool E1 who were positive for 
neutralizing antibodies (NAb-positive) at Week 16, compared to the anti-drug antibody (ADAb)-
negative population in Pool E1 for the PASI90, IGA0/1, PASI100 and IGA0 endpoints. Overall, the 
analysis indicated that NAb-positive study participants do not lose response over time. 
E2 pool subgroup analyses - (Maintenance Treatment Group, all 3 pivotal studies) 
In the E2 pooled analysis group, maintenance of response through Week 52 was similar for the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg Q8W maintenance treatment groups, with better 
results obtained using the Q8W regimen in many subgroups. These findings support the proposed Q8W 
maintenance regime. Overall, there were no notable differences in maintenance of effect seen in the 
key subgroups of Baseline disease severity (PASI<20, PASI≥20) or age. For race, geographical region, 
and prior systemic therapy for PSO, some differences were noted, either between subgroup categories 
within the maintenance treatment regimen or between maintenance treatment regimens. The 
subgroup findings in the Maintenance Treatment Group support the use of bimekizumab in patients 
who require systemic treatment. 
In Pool E2 Week 16 responders, NAb status had no impact on efficacy. Higher PASI90 and IGA 0/1 
response rates at Week 52 were noted in NAb-positive study participants compared to NAb-negative 
participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, whereas a smaller opposite trend was observed in 
the bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group. There were no notable differences noted in the PASI100 NAb 
subgroup analyses. 
An additional analysis of week 16 responders of pool E2, who were type ADAb-negative or NAb+ at week 
16, showed that treatment response for the PASI90, PASI100 and IGA0/1 endpoints was maintained up 
to week 52 at levels that were highly similar between groups, suggesting that NAb antibody status at 
week 16 does not impact maintenance of response in treatment responders.  
Overall, antibody positivity did not appear to have an impact on efficacy in the pivotal trials, however 
numbers of subjects in the antibody positive subgroups were small. It is also noted that neutralizing 
antibodies were not assessed as a covariate in the population PK and PKPD analyses.  
A post-hoc analysis of the impact of NAb status on the efficacy of bimekizumab was performed for all 
study participants who were anti-drug antibody (ADAb)-positive at 2 timepoints and received 
bimekizumab in the Initial and Maintenance Treatment Periods in the Phase 3 studies. Both at week 16 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 164/220 
 
 
 
and week 52, the efficacy response was lower in the NAb+ group compared to the ADAb negative 
population but limited to about 10% difference at most. The reported numbers for the NAb+ group 
have to be interpreted with caution as the number of subjects in this group is limited (n=34). 
Altogether, this analysis does not indicate a long-term negative impact of NAb-positive antibody status 
on efficacy outcomes. Appropriate information has been added to SmPC – section 4.8. 
In the Maintenance Treatment Phase Subgroup analysis (Pool E2), results suggested that a 
bimekizumab Q8W treatment schedule in subjects weighing >120 kg may be preferable, however total 
numbers of subjects in the >120 kg subgroup were low overall. Population PK simulations indicated 
that there may be lower bimekizumab exposure in persons of higher weights. Similarly, persons of 
lower weights may have higher exposures (See PK section of AR for further discussion). The applicant 
presented additional data in patients weighing 120 kg or more from ongoing study PS0015 to 
complement the limited patient numbers that were considered previously. In the phase 3 clinical 
program, 116 patients have now been identified with a body weight of minimum 120 kg at baseline.  
In the initial treatment period, the efficacy outcomes reported at week 16 for the subgroup of patients 
weighing 120 kg or more (n=116) are consistent with those reported previously in this patient group 
(n=86). Especially for the more stringent endpoints PASI100 and IGA 0, there remains a significant 
lower response compared to patients that weigh less than 120 kg.  
For the maintenance treatment period, the applicant conducted post-hoc subgroup analyses (<120kg 
vs ≥120kg) for the key efficacy endpoints PASI90, IGA 0/1, PASI100, and IGA 0 for the pooled data 
across studies PS0008, PS0009, and PS0015. Study participants in the ≥120kg group (N=88 
[Q4W/Q8W=37; Q4W=51]) on the Q4W maintenance regimen showed greater improvement in 
PASI100 between Week 16 (39.2%) and Week 48 (68.6%), compared with those on the Q8W 
maintenance regimen (Week 16: 45.9% vs Week 48: 51.4%). As such, Q4W maintenance appears 
more effective at week 48 compared to Q8W maintenance therapy in patients weighing 120 kg or more 
in the most stringent endpoints, with the new data set on the expanded patient group confirming the 
previously reported outcomes.  
A posology recommendation of bimekizumab Q4W in the Maintenance Phase has been made in the 
SmPC for patients weighing ≥120 kg who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16, this has 
been accepted by CHMP.  
E3 pool subgroup analyses (Study PS0008 & PS0009 Q4W dosing data from Screening onwards) 
Notable differences between subgroups included the finding that PASI90, IGA 0/1, and PASI100 
response rates were higher in Central/Eastern Europe compared with the other regions. PASI90 
response rates were also higher for study participants with prior exposure to systemic therapy for PSO 
compared with no prior exposure. A general Q4W bimekizumab dose in plaque psoriasis is not being 
pursued by the applicant. However, the applicant proposes a Q4W maintenance treatment dose in 
patients weighing ≥120 kg and this has been accepted by the CHMP. 
PS0014 study with patients previously treated with ustekinumab 
The applicant provided updated results from the ongoing PS0014 study. The high-level results show 
that IGA0/1 and PASI 90 over time was consistent with the pivotal studies and also demonstrated 
efficacy on nail, scalp psoriasis as well as on patients switched from Ustekinumab. 
Studies DV0002 and DV0006 
The applicant demonstrated that patients were able to self-administer safe and effective injections 8 
weeks after training in self-injection technique or immediately after training in self-injection technique 
using the bimekizumab-SS-1mL or the bimekizumab-AI-1mL.  
Bimzelx - Assessment report

Upon request from CHMP, the applicant added a statement in the SmPC – section 4.2 regarding non-
responders after 16 weeks of treatment as follows:  
 “Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no 
improvement by 16 weeks of treatment.” 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data demonstrated superiority of bimekizumab 320 mg s.c. compared to placebo, 
adalimumab and ustekinumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study 
population included both systemic treatment naïve patients as well as those previously exposed to 
systemic therapies including biologic therapies. The efficacy of bimekizumab 320 mg s.c. is clinically 
highly relevant, with fast onset of action and a maintenance of effect was demonstrated. Therefore, 
the CHMP considers that the available efficacy data support the following therapeutic indication: 
Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In the initial application, safety data from 8 phase 2, phase 3 and OLE studies, in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PS0010, PS0011, PS0016, PS0018, PS0008, PS0009, PS0013, 
and PS0014) were pooled to summarize the safety of bimekizumab. In these 8 studies, 1789 patients 
were treated with bimekizumab with a total time at risk of 1830.4 participant-years. This included 
exposure up to the data cut-off for the PS0014 study (01 November 2019) which was ongoing. A total 
of 1495 study participants (1461.5 participant-years) were treated with bimekizumab in the pivotal 
phase 3 studies (PS0008, PS0009 and PS0013). A total of 1399 study participants (78.2%) and 1073 
participants (60.0%) were exposed to bimekizumab in Phase 2 and 3 studies for at least 8 months and 
12 months, respectively. A total 237 (13.2%) were exposed for >16 months with no patients treated 
for greater than 2 years.  
The Applicant issued on 19 October 2020 a 120-Day Safety Update report, complementing the initial 
Summary of Clinical Safety with 5.5 months of additional safety data. The update primarily consisted 
of additional long-term safety data from the open-label extension (OLE) study (PS0014). As of the 
120-Day Safety Update clinical cut-off date (15 April 2020), the total time at risk was 2055.7 
participant-years in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group compared with 1461.5 participant-years in 
the initial submission. A total of 1172 study participants were exposed to bimekizumab for ≥12 months 
during the phase 3 studies, out of which 214 study participants were treated with the maintenance 
dose of bimekizumab 320mg Q8W for ≥12 months. 
In addition, two device presentation studies DV0002 and DV0006 evaluating self-injection technique 
and 3 formative human factors evaluations were conducted during the development of the 
bimekizumab-AI-1mL and bimekizumab-SS-1mL. In addition, Study UP0033 a phase I study conducted 
in healthy subjects demonstrated the bioequivalence of the drug substance formulation administered in 
the PFS (with true north secondary packaging) utilised in phase III studies in the PSO population, 
relative to the (commercial scale) drug substance to be administered in a safety syringe (SS) device 
and auto-injector (AI) (i.e. pre-filled pen) presentations proposed for marketing.

Table 39 - Study medication duration and participant-years of time at risk (Pool S2) 
The full safety analysis for the bimekizumab PSO program included a review of safety data from 5 
integrated safety pools (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5).  
Pool S1 included 670 study participants who received bimekizumab 320mg Q4W compared with 
placebo, in Studies PS0009 and PS0013, of which 646 study participants (96.4%) completed these 
studies. This was the Primary safety pool and was used to summarize safety of bimekizumab versus 
PBO through Week 16 and to investigate subgroups. 
In response to concerns regarding the completeness of Pool S1 (including only Week 16 data from 
placebo-controlled periods of studies PS0009 and PS0013), the applicant included additional exposure 
and safety data from the 16-week Treatment Period of PS0008 (active-comparator-controlled study 
with adalimumab) and from the 12-week Treatment Period of PS0010 (placebo and bimekizumab 
320mg every 4 weeks [Q4W] treatment arms) to create a new post hoc Pool S1C. 
Pool S1C included 211 study participants in the placebo group (original Pool S1: N=169) and 1032 
participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (original Pool S1: N=670) and contained 
comparative data with adalimumab (N=159) and ustekinumab (N=163). 
Pool S2, including all Phase 2 and Phase 3 data from studies in PSO, included 1789 study participants. 
Safety data from the Initial Treatment Period, Maintenance Treatment Period, and OLE data were 
combined. Four safety treatment groups were included in this analysis defined as “Phase 3 BKZ 320mg 
Q4W”, “Phase 3 BKZ 320mg Q8W”, “Phase 3 BKZ Total”, and “Phase 2/3 BKZ Total”, reflecting the 
several different doses administered across these studies. The “Phase 2/3 BKZ Total” summary 
combined all bimekizumab doses. A total of 841 patients with PSO have been exposed to the highest 
dose (bimekizumab 320mg Q4W) for a period of ≥ 1 year. 214 study subjects have been treated with 
the maintenance dose of (bimekizumab 320mg Q8W) treatment for ≥12 months. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 167/220 
 
 
 
 
 
Data for active comparators (ustekinumab N=163, adalimumab N=159) were only included in a subset 
of outputs (Adverse Events of Special Interest and Deaths) produced for Pool S2. 
Pool S2 had 4 additional sub pools: S2A (data collected while on blinded bimekizumab); S2B (Data 
from PS0009 and PS0013 during the Maintenance Period only to evaluate whether the AE profile 
changes with prolonged exposure); S2C (Data from PS0008 and PS0013 during the Initial and 
Maintenance Period comparing the safety of both maintenance treatment regimens tested 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W or Q8W) after an Initial Treatment Period of 320mg Q4W for 16 weeks.); 
and S2D (Pool S2 data in which study participants with ≤4 weeks of bimekizumab 320mg Q8W dosing 
after treatment switched in PS0014 had their Q8W data excluded.) 
Safety Pool S3 and Pool S4 summarized plasma concentrations and ADAb, and NAb data including data 
from device sub studies DV0002 and DV0006 to allow for pooled assessment by dose regimen and 
device type (autoinjector and safety syringe).  
Bimekizumab has also been studied in clinical trials of psoriasis and other indications). Safety Pool S5 
combines PSO data with data from other indications in the bimekizumab program. A total of 2178 
patients were exposed to bimekizumab in this analysis. 
Pool 5 did not include exposure from ongoing studies in these indications. Two complete studies were 
not included in the analysis on the basis that the applicant was no longer developing bimekizumab for 
these indications and the dosing regimens and patient populations studied differ substantially from 
those in the PSO program.  
Adverse events 
The overall risk of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) decreased with longer exposure to 
bimekizumab based on a comparison of exposure-adjusted safety data derived from Pool S1 and Pool 
S2. The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation, severe TEAEs, and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) in Pool S1 and Pool S2 was low. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity 
(>90%). There was a trend towards increased severe TEAEs and SAEs in pool S2 compared to Pool S1. 
When adjusting for exposure, exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIRs) of severe TEAEs in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab Total group were slightly higher in Pool S2 (5.8/100 PYs) compared with the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group in Pool S1 (3.9/100 PYs); however EAIRs were still lower compared to 
the placebo group in Pool S1 (7.8/100 PYs). Similarly, for SAES, in Pool S1, EAIR was 5.3/100 PYs in 
the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and EAIR was 7.8/100 PYs in the placebo group. For Pool S2, 
EAIR was 6.8/100 PYs for SAEs.  
In the new Pool S1C, 42.2% of placebo treated patients (n=89/211) and 60% (n=619/1032) of 
bimekizumab Q4W treated patients reported TEAEs.

Common Adverse events 
Initial 16-week treatment period (Pool S1 and Pool S1C) 
In both analyses, the most commonly reported AEs on bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis, oral 
candidiasis and headache. Upper respiratory tract infection (UTI) and arthralgia, psoriatic arthropathy, 
psoriasis were reported at a higher incidence in the placebo group compared with the bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W group.

In the S1 pool the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of severe TEAEs 
was 1.2% in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and 2.4% in the placebo group. No severe TEAEs, by 
PT, were reported by more than 1 study participant.  
The commonest drug related TEAEs in Pool S1 were oral candidiasis (5.8%), and oropharyngeal 
candidiasis and pruritus generalised (1.2% each). 
Longer-term treatment (Pool S2) 
In Pool S2, during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and OLE Treatment Period, TEAEs were reported 
by  80.8%  (EAIR:  231.4/100  participant-years)  in  the  Phase  3  bimekizumab  Total  groups.  In  the  S2 
Safety  Update,  TEAEs  were  reported  by  86.9%  (EAIR:  210.9/100  participant-years)  in  the  Phase  3 
bimekizumab Total groups. 
Table 42 - Overview of TEAEs (Pool S2) original MAA submission and Safety Update 
The most frequently reported SOCs  were ‘Infections and infestations’ (EAIR 120.4/100 participant-
years), ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (EAIR 23.7/100 participant-years), ‘Gastrointestinal 
disorders’ (EAIR 21.1/100 participant-years), ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’ (EAIR 
16.8/100 participant-years), and ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ (EAIR 9.0/100 
participant-years). In the S2 Safety Update, the EAIRs for these SOCs were similar to or lower than 
those in the original application. (EAIR for gastroenteritis (1.9 vs 2.1) influenza (1.8 vs 2.0) bronchitis 
(2.5 vs 2.7) and UTI (3.8 vs 4.2)). 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 171/220 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (21.2%), oral candidiasis (15.7%), and 
upper respiratory tract infection (9.6%). All other TEAEs were reported in <5% of participants. 
Psoriasis was reported by 1.9% of study participants. In the S2 Safety Update, the most frequently 
reported TEAEs were the same with similar to or lower incidences than those in the original application.  
The incidence of severe TEAEs was 5.5%. The following severe TEAEs by PT were reported by more 
than 1 study participant: acute myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction (0.2% each) cellulitis, 
oral candidiasis, hepatic enzyme increased (0.2% each), type 2 diabetes mellitus, duodenal ulcer 
haemorrhage, back pain, abortion spontaneous, and eczema (0.1% each). The EAIRs of severe TEAEs 
in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group in the S2 safety update analysis were slightly lower (5.2/100 
participant-years) compared with the original MAA submission (5.8/100 participant-years).

Drug-related  TEAEs  by  PT  (as  assessed  by  the  Investigator)  were  reported  primarily  for  the  SOC  of 
‘Infections  and infestations’  (Pool  S1:  BKZ  Q4W  13.9%  vs  PLB  3.6%  and  Pool  S2:  Phase  3  BKZ  total 
29.3%;  S2  Safety  Update  Phase  3  BKZ  total  33.9%).  The  EAIR  for  related  TEAEs  in  the  Phase  3 
bimekizumab Total group (42.9/100 PYs; 120-Day SU) was lower than that in the original submission 
(Pool S2 50.5/100 participant-years). 
The commonest drug related TEAEs in pool S2  were Oral candidiasis (13.2%), nasopharyngitis (5.1%), 
folliculitis (1.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.5%), oral fungal infection (1.3%), oropharyngeal 
candidiasis  (1.2%),  tinea  pedis  (1.1%),  pharyngitis  (1.1%),  conjunctivitis  (1.1%),  sinusitis  (1.0%), 
urinary tract infection (1.0%), and eczema (1.0%) in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 173/220 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In the S2 Safety Update the most frequently reported drug-related TEAE was oral candidiasis. The 
EAIR for drug-related oral candidiasis (13.1/100 PYs; 120-Day SU) was lower than that in the original 
PoolS2 submission (14.8/100 PYs). 
An evaluation by duration of treatment showed that the incidence of TEAEs in the Phase 2/3  
bimekizumab Total group was highest in the earliest > 0 to 16-week time interval (60.4%) and 
subsequently decreased to 53.8% in the >16 to 32-week and to 47.1% in the >32 to 48-week time 
intervals, respectively. A similar picture was seen for the BKZ 320mg Q4W and BKZ 320mg Q8W 
analyses over the same time intervals. 
In a comparison of the safety of Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and 320mg Q8W dosing regimens 
during the maintenance period, the incidence rate of TEAEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab was higher in 
320mg Q8W group (76.7%) compared with the Q4W group (73.9%) with slightly higher incidences of 
SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation and severe TEAEs. Drug-related TEAEs were slightly higher in 
the 320mg Q4W treated group compared to the 320mg Q8W for the following TEAEs potentially linked 
to the mode of action: Candida infections (15.3% vs 10.9%), Dermatitis and eczema (5.7% vs 2.7%), 
and Bacterial infections NEC (5.4% vs 2.7%). 
Analysis of adverse device effects 
Different versions of the IMP were used across the clinical development programme. The devices 
proposed for marketing (bimekizumab-SS-1mL and bimekizumab-AI-1mL (used in DV0002 and 
DV0006)) were not used in the pivotal studies. The applicant has undertaken a drug comparability 
exercise and demonstrated that the change in process at both the drug product and drug substance 
level is minor and is well supported by comparability data. In addition Study UP0033 a phase I study 
conducted in healthy subjects demonstrated the bioequivalence of the drug substance formulation used 
in phase III studies, relative to the drug substance to be administered in a safety syringe (SS) device 
and on an auto-injection (AI) (i.e. pre-filled pen) presentations proposed for marketing. 
Two device presentation studies (DV0002 and DV0006) evaluating self-injection technique and 3 
formative human factors evaluations were conducted during the development of the bimekizumab-AI-
1mL and bimekizumab-SS-1mL. The device presentation studies (DV0002 andDV0006) were conducted 
as sub-studies of the ongoing OLE study PS00014.  A total of 134 study participants from PS0014 were 
enrolled in the DV0002 sub study and 88 study participants from PS0014 were enrolled in the DV0006 
sub study. Overall, the incidence of TEAEs by SOC from both DV0002 and DV0006 for device type (SS 
and AI) are comparable (43.2% vs 42.7%). There were no ADEs (adverse device effect) reported; in 
particular, there were no treatment-emergent ADEs, nor serious ADEs. Further, there was no study 
participant discontinuations due to treatment-emergent ADEs, and no deaths reported with either 
investigational device presentation (bimekizumab-SS-1mL or bimekizumab-AI-1mL) or dosing regimen 
(bimekizumab 320mg Q8W or bimekizumab 320mg Q4W).   
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In Pool S1, incidences of SAEs were low and similar to placebo in the first 16 weeks of treatment 
(1.6% and 2.4% in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and placebo groups, respectively). Serious AEs 
(bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group vs placebo) were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ (0.4% vs 0 study participants), ‘Infections and infestations’ (0.3% vs 0 
study participants) and ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’ (0.3% vs 0 study 
participants). No SAE was reported by >1 study participant in any treatment group. One case of 
Retinal detachment, Colitis Ulcerative, enteritis, diverticular perforation, enterovirus, pneumonia, 
intracranial haemorrhage, cardiac arrest, and myocardial infarction was reported in subjects treated 
with bimekizumab.

In Pool S2, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 4% for study participants (EAIR: 
6.8/100 participant-years) in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group. Incidences of SAEs in the 
ustekinumab group and adalimumab group were 7.4% and 3.1% respectively. In the Phase 3 
bimekizumab Total group, SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of ‘Infections and 
infestations’ (1.5% EAIR: 1.6/100 participant-years), ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ (0.9% EAIR: 0.9/100 
participant-years), ‘Cardiac disorders’ (0.7% EAIR: 0.7/100 participant-years), ‘Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders’ (0.6% EAIR: 0.6/100 participant-years), ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications’ and ‘Nervous system disorders’ (0.5% each EAIR: 0.5/100 participant-years). Acute 
myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, cellulitis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were reported by 3 
study participants (0.2% each) and humerus fracture by 2 study participants (0.1%) in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab Total group. 
The incidence rates of SAE were similar across doses, with 3.1% in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W group and 11 study participants and 4.3% in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group 
reporting SAEs. 
S2 Safety update  
The EAIR for SAEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group (6.2/100 participant-years) was lower than 
that in the original MAA submission (6.8/100 participant-years). Similar to the original S2 analysis, 
serious AEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group were most frequently reported in the SOCs of 
‘Infections and infestations’, ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’, ‘Cardiac disorders’, ‘Nervous system 
disorders’, ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’, and ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications disorders’. A total of 36 additional SAEs were reported in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total 
group. The most frequently reported additional SAEs were colon cancer, and Coronary artery stenosis 
reported by 2 participants each. All other additional SAEs were reported by 1 study participant each.

2/3 bimekizumab total group (Pool S2) 
Deaths 
Of 8 deaths, 5 were reported in bimekizumab-treated study participants. One TEAE leading to death 
occurred in each of the placebo, ustekinumab, and adalimumab treatment groups. The Cardiovascular

Clinical Event Adjudication Committee (CV-CAC) and the Neuropsychiatric Adjudication Committee 
adjudicated all TEAEs with a fatal outcome. All of the deaths occurred in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
group. Two fatal events in the bimekizumab group were adjudicated as MACE: one was adjudicated as 
sudden cardiac death (PT: cardiac arrest) and 1 was adjudicated as other CV death (PT: 
cardiopulmonary failure); both occurred in study participants with significant CV risk factors. Both 
events were considered not related to bimekizumab by Investigators. 
S2 Safety update  
One additional death has been reported. This additional fatal TEAE (myocardial infarction) was 
adjudicated as MACE (sudden cardiac death) by the CV-CAC; a brief summary is provided below. 
•  a patient in the bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group experienced a TEAE of myocardial infarction 
during the OLE study PS0014; the event was serious, severe, assessed by the investigator as 
not related to investigational medicinal product (IMP), and fatal. The event occurred 437 days 
after first bimekizumab dose and 36 days after the most recent bimekizumab injection. Cardiac 
risk factors included body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m2, hypertension, cerebrovascular 
accident (10 years prior to death), and alcohol use within the past 6 months (2 units/week). 
Other significant treatment-emergent adverse events 
Infections, malignancies, MACE, neutropenia, suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB), inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD), anaphylactic, hypersensitivity, and injection site reactions, and hepatic TEAEs and 
liver function test (LFT) elevations were prespecified as being of special interest and were further 
evaluated.

Table 45 – Overview of adverse events (Pool S1 and S2) 
Infections 
Overall, infections were the most frequently reported TEAEs. The vast majority >98% were non-
serious, mild to moderate in intensity, and did not lead to study drug discontinuation. In Pool S1, 36% 
of bimekizumab treated patients versus 22.5% of placebo treated patients reported any infection. In 
Pool S2, 63.2% of bimekizumab Phase 2/3 BKZ Total population reported any infection. The EAIR in 
Pool S2 was 117.8/100 participant-years and 141.7/100 participant-years in S1. In the S2 Safety 
update EAIRs were lower (108.5/100 participant-years; 120-Day SU) than those in the original MAA 
submission (117.8/100 participant years). 
In Pool S1, the incidence of serious infections was 0.3%; EAIR: 1.0/100 PYs in the bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W group. No study participant experienced a serious infection while receiving placebo. 
In Pool S2, the incidence of serious infections was 1.4%; EAIR: 1.4/100 PYs in the Phase 2/3 
bimekizumab Total group and 2.5%; EAIR: 2.6/100 PYs in the ustekinumab and 0.6%; EAIR: 1.4/100 
PYs in the adalimumab groups. There was no evidence of an increase in infection with increased 
duration of treatment, the incidences of serious infections across time intervals were (>0 to 16 weeks 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021

[0.3%] ;> 16 to 32 weeks [0.5%]; and >32 to 48 weeks [0.3%]). BY High Level Term (HLT) infections 
were most commonly reported in the gastrointestinal infections, Bacterial infections not elsewhere 
classified (NEC), Muscle and soft tissue infections, Upper respiratory tract infections subcategories. Of 
the 25 serious infections observed on bimekizumab, 9 were moderate in intensity and 16 were severe. 
None of the serious infections led to a fatal outcome. Cellulitis (3 study participants,) appendicitis and 
staphylococcal abscess (2 study participants) were the only PTs reported in more than 1 study 
participant. Study drug was permanently discontinued in 2 study participants due to TEAEs of 
oesophageal candidiasis and anal abscess. All serious infections were resolved at the time of reporting. 
The EAIR for serious infections in Pool S2 Safety update Group was 1.2/100 PYs, compared with 
1.4/100 PYs in the original MAA submission. Events were mostly related to skin (cellulitis, abscess), 
ear infections, and the gastrointestinal tract. A total of 3 additional serious infections (abscess limb, 
erysipelas, and ophthalmic herpes zoster) were reported. All 3 of these additional serious infections 
were resolved. None of the participants had a recurrence of serious infections. 
There were no opportunistic infections reported with bimekizumab in the PSO studies other than 
localized mucocutaneous fungal events. In Pool S2, the proportion of study participants reporting a 
fungal infection TEAE was 22.6%; EAIR: 26.0/100 PY) in the bimekizumab Total group compared to 
ustekinumab and adalimumab groups (2.5%; EAIR: 2.6/100 PYs and 0.6%; EAIR: 1.4/100 PYs, 
respectively). Fungal infection TEAEs were observed in the 3 HLTs of Candida infections, Fungal 
infections NEC, and Tinea infections. Within the HLTs, TEAEs (≥2%) were observed for PTs oral 
candidiasis (15.1%, 0.6%, and 0%, respectively) and tinea pedis (2.0%, 0.6%, and 0%, respectively). 
One study participant had a serious fungal infection (oesophageal candidiasis) that resulted in 
discontinuation from the study. Seven study participants discontinued due to a fungal infection: oral 
candidiasis (3 participants), oesophageal candidiasis (2 participants), oropharyngitis fungal and 
oropharyngeal candidiasis (1 participant each). There were no cases of active tuberculosis (TB) among 
bimekizumab-treated study participants. 
The EAIR for opportunistic infections in Pool S2 Safety update Group was 2.2/100 PYs, compared with 
2.3/100 PYs in the original MAA submission. In Pool S2 Safety update group, the proportion of study 
participants reporting a fungal infection TEAE was 23.4%; EAIR: 37.2/100 PY compared with 22.6%; 
EAIR: 26.0/100 PY in the original MAA. opportunistic infections were localized fungal events classified 
as opportunistic by internal company convention, with the exception of one ophthalmic herpes zoster. 
The reported event of ophthalmic herpes zoster was serious, severe, related to IMP, resolved, and did 
not lead to discontinuation. 
There were no cases of active TB or reactivation of TB in study participants with a history of latent TB 
among bimekizumab-treated study participants. A QuantiFERON TB test laboratory reporting error 
impacted on 5 samples from pivotal psoriasis (PSO) studies (PS0009 and PS0013) was reported. All 5 
study participants rolled over into the PS0014 Open Label Extension (OLE) study. A review of all 
adverse events reported for these subjects during the feeder studies (PS0009 and PS0013) and the 
OLE study revealed no cases of active TB.  
Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions 
In Pool S1, there were no serious hypersensitivity reactions. In Pool S2, in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab 
Total group, 3 study participants (0.2%; EAIR 0.2/100 PY [95% CI: 0.0, 0.5]) experienced a serious 
hypersensitivity reaction: anaphylactic shock, dermatitis atopic, and circulatory collapse in 1 study 
participant each. The TEAE of anaphylactic shock was reported as ‘anaphylactic shock due to insect 
sting’ and considered unrelated to bimekizumab. The TEAE of circulatory collapse was not related to 
hypersensitivity but an unrelated post-surgical complication. This event was fatal. The event atopic 
dermatitis was attributed to an environmental factor. TEAEs of hypersensitivity and drug 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 178/220 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity were reported only in study participants who were ADAb-negative throughout the 
studies. 
In Pool S2 safety update, the EAIR for hypersensitivity (10.3/100 PYs; 120-Day SU) was lower than 
that in the original MAA submission (10.9/100 PYs). No additional serious hypersensitivity reactions 
were reported during this Safety Update. The majority of hypersensitivity reactions in the Phase 2/3 
bimekizumab Total group were reported in the SOC of ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (EAIR: 
8.3/100 PYs compared with EAIR: 8.8/100 PYs in the original MAA submission); mainly from the HLT 
Dermatitis and eczema. One additional severe TEAE (PT: dermatitis contact) and 1 additional TEAE 
leading to discontinuation (PT: dermatitis contact) were reported in the updated S2 analysis. 
Injection Site Reactions 
In Pool S1 the incidence of injection site reactions (ISR) was 2.8% in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
group and 1.2% in the placebo group. In Pool S2, the incidence of ISR overall was 3.1%; EAIR: 
3.1/100 PYs in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group). Incidences in the ustekinumab and 
adalimumab groups were 1.8% [EAIR: 1.9/100 PYs] and 3.1% [EAIR: 7.0/100 PYs], respectively). All 
ISRwere non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and did not lead to study discontinuation. All ISR 
started before the first ADAb-positive result was observed or occurred in study participants who were 
always ADAb-negative. 
The EAIR ISR in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group was lower (2.6/100 PYs) in the S2 safety 
update analysis compared to the original MAA submission (3.1/100 PYs). All ISR were non-serious, 
mild or moderate in intensity, and did not lead to study discontinuation. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 
In Pool S1, one study participant (0.1%; EAIR 0.5/100py) in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group 
reported a TEAE of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (PT: Ulcerative colitis). No study participants in 
the placebo group reported an IBD TEAE. In Pool S2, no additional TEAEs of IBD were reported in any 
treatment group.  
The EAIR for IBD events was 0.041/100 participant-years in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group 
(S2 Safety update), compared with 0.055/100 participant-years in the original MAA submission. No 
additional events of IBD were reported; however, a case of gastrointestinal inflammation was reported 
3.5 months after the first dose of bimekizumab 320mg Q4W in PS0013. The event was serious, 
moderate, related to IMP, resulted in temporary interruption of IMP, and had an outcome of resolved. 
Treatment with IMP was re-introduced. A diagnosis of non-infectious gastroenteritis and colitis 
suggestive of a very early stage of Crohn's disease was made.

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
In Pool S1, the incidence of any adjudicated MACE in the Initial Treatment Period was low in the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (cardiac arrest in 1 study participant [0.1%]; EAIR: 0.5/100 PY). This 
event was fatal. No adjudicated MACE TEAE was reported in the placebo group. 
In Pool S2, MACE TEAEs were reported in 12 study participants (0.7%; EAIR 0.7/100PYs) in the Phase 
2/3 bimekizumab Total group. No MACE was observed for active comparator groups in Pool S2 
analysis. MACE TEAEs reported for 2 or more study participants were myocardial infarction (4 study 
participants, 0.2%), acute myocardial infarction (3 study participants, 0.2%), and cerebral infarction 
(2 study participants, 0.1%). There was one additional fatal event of cardiopulmonary failure, and an 
event of myocardial infarction which resolved with sequelae. The remaining TEAEs were reported as 
resolved. 
In the S2 safety update, the EAIRs for adjudicated MACE, extended MACE, and adjudicated CV events 
in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group were similar to or lower than those in the original MAA 
submission. In the Pool S2 update, MACE TEAEs were reported in 14 study participants (0.8%; EAIR 
0.6/100PYs) in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group compared with 12 study participants (0.7%; 
EAIR 0.7/100PYs) in the original MAA. Two additional adjudicated MACE (1 sudden cardiac death and 1 
nonfatal ischemic stroke) were reported. A patient experienced a fatal TEAE of myocardial infarction 
(also discussed in Section on Deaths). The second patient experienced a TEAE of cerebral ischemia 
approximately 18 months after first bimekizumab dose; the event was serious, moderate in intensity, 
not related to IMP, resulted in temporary interruption of IMP, and was considered resolved. The patient 
had a history of and its medical history was also significant for migraine headaches and an 
intracerebral developmental venous anomaly. 
No notable trends were observed in the post-baseline ECG outlier values across all treatment groups in 
Pool S1. In Pool S1, no trends in QTcF increases were observed and no study participant had QTcF 
>500ms. In Pool S2, 1 study participant had QTcF >500ms that was asymptomatic and no TEAE 
related to this finding was reported. In addition to TEAEs related to ECG measurements, review was 
performed for TEAEs of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, syncope, and seizures to evaluate 
potential clinical consequences of severe arrhythmias. Overall, the incidences of those TEAEs were low 
and their review did not indicate a safety concern. 
Malignancy 
In Pool S1, one study participant in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group experienced a TEAE of basal 
cell carcinoma. One study participant in the placebo group experienced a TEAE of oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma. In Pool S2, the incidence of malignant tumour TEAEs in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab 
Total group was 0.8% (EAIR: 0.8/100 PY) compared with 0.6% (EAIR: 0.6/100 participant-years) in 
the ustekinumab treatment group and 0.6%; EAIR: 1.4/100 participant-years) in the adalimumab. 
Malignant tumour TEAEs reported in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group are basal cell carcinoma 
(7 study participants (0.4%)), colon cancer (2 study participants (0.1%)), gastric cancer, anal 
squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, squamous cell carcinoma (in 1 participant who 
also experienced basal cell carcinoma), squamous cell carcinoma of lung, squamous cell carcinoma of 
skin, and keratoacanthoma (1 study participant (<0.1%)) each. 
In the Pool S2 safety update analysis, the EAIR for any malignancy (0.8/100 participant-years) is the 
same as that in the original MAA submission. Six additional malignancies (colon cancer (2 cases), colon 
cancer metastatic, squamous cell carcinoma of skin (2 cases], and bronchial carcinoma) were reported. 
No malignancy was considered drug-related by the Investigator. The patients ranged in age from 49 to 
70 yrs, Time to onset ranged from 16 to 22 months after first bimekizumab injection. Two of the 3 
cases of colon cancer occurred in patients <60yrs. Four of the cases resulted in withdrawal from the 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 180/220 
 
 
 
study (colon cancer (2 cases), colon metastatic (1case) and bronchial carcinoma (1 case)). All cases 
had contributing risk factors that confound causality assessment. 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB)  
The incidence rate of adjudicated SIB was 0.1 per 100 participant-years. No completed suicide or 
suicidal attempt was reported in study participants on bimekizumab in the PSO development program. 
One TEAE was adjudicated as suicidal ideation. This case was confounded by a diagnosis of 
schizoaffective disorder- bipolar type and medical history of suicide attempt.  
Three study participants (0.2%) had a PHQ-9 Total Score ≥20 post-Baseline (indicating severe major 
depression). This was also captured as TEAE of psychiatric evaluation abnormal. The TEAEs were 
assessed as related to bimekizumab by the Investigator and the patients were withdrawn from the 
study. 
In the Pool S2 updated safety analysis, no additional adjudicated SIB was reported. The EAIR of SIB as 
adjudicated by the Neuropsychiatric Adjudication Committee under bimekizumab was 0.0/100 
participant-years, compared with 0.1/100 participant-years in the original MAA submission. The EAIR 
of TEAEs in the Psychiatric disorders SOC was 2.7/100 PYs, which is lower than that in the original MAA 
submission (3.4/100 PYs). 
Hepatic TEAEs and LFT elevations 
In Pool S1, the incidences of hepatic TEAEs were 2.1%; (EAIR: 6.8/100 PY) in the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W group and 1.2%; (EAIR: 3.9/100 participant-years) in the placebo group. Most of the TEAEs in 
the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group were reports of isolated laboratory abnormalities (MedDRA HLT 
Liver function analyses). None of the hepatic TEAEs reported in Pool S1 was serious or severe in 
intensity. The rate of abnormal LFTs (ALT elevation >3xULN and AST elevation >3xULN) was 6% of 
placebo group and 1% of BKZ 320mg Q4W. One case of AST exceeding 20xULN and was attributed to 
gallstones. 
In Pool S2, 5.5% (EAIR: 5.6/100 PYs) in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group experienced hepatic 
TEAEs, which was slightly higher than on ustekinumab (2.5%; EAIR: 2.6/100 PYs). Compared to 
adalimumab, the EAIR was lower (6.9%; EAIR: 15.8/100 PYs). The majority of reported hepatic TEAEs 
across all 3 groups were reports of laboratory abnormalities (HLT Liver function analyses). In the BKZ 
treated patients there were 8 cases (0.4%) of non-alcoholic fatty liver ,3 (0.2%) each of drug-induced 
liver injury and hepatic function abnormal, 2 (0.1%) each hepatic steatosis in non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis and steatohepatitis. Hepatomegaly, autoimmune hepatitis, liver injury, and blood 
alkaline phosphatase increased were reported in 1 study participant (0.1% each). The incidence of 
hepatic TEAEs reporting laboratory abnormalities with bimekizumab (4.8%; EAIR: 4.8/100 participant-
years), was higher than with ustekinumab (2.5%; EAIR: 2.6/100 participant-years), but lower than 
with adalimumab (6.9%; EAIR: 15.8/100 participant-years). Hepatic disorders (n=24), was the most 
frequent cause of discontinuation of study drug and included the 3 reports of drug-induced liver injury 
reported in Pool S2. The incidence rates of hepatic TEAEs in Phase 3 studies were similar between the 
Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and Q8W dose regimens. 
In the Pool S2 Safety Update analysis, the EAIR for hepatic TEAEs (4.8/100 participant-years) was 
lower than that in the original MAA submission (5.6/100 participant-years). No new serious or severe 
hepatic TEAEs were reported, and no new hepatic TEAEs led to study discontinuation.  
In terms of treatment-emergent markedly abnormal liver function (Pool S2), either AST or ALT 
elevations >3xULN were observed in 2.8% of the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group in Pool S2. Two 
bimekizumab-treated study participants reached the threshold of Hy’s Law based on laboratory values. 
However, in both cases non-drug-related causes for the observed LFT abnormalities were reported. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 181/220 
 
 
 
Three study participants experienced hepatic TEAEs reported as serious. Five additional study 
participants had LFT elevations with ≥8xULN, with no reported SAE.  
In the Pool S2 Safety Update analysis, the EAIR for the HLT Liver function analyses (4.1/100 PYs) was 
lower than that in the original MAA submission (4.8/100 participant-years) There were no new study 
participants meeting Hy’s Law laboratory criteria during this Safety Update. In this Safety Update, no 
new TEMA (>5xULN) of ALT increased were reported. One study participant experienced an AST 
elevation >5xULN and ≤8xULN. Also reported as TEAE of hepatic enzyme increased and a TEAE of fatty 
liver alcoholic, both were reported as nonserious, not leading to discontinuation, and resolving.  
Neutropenia 
The percentage of study participants with shifts from normal at baseline to low post-baseline minimum 
values was generally small across all treatment groups with no dose related trend. In the BKZ 320mg 
Q4W 5.2% reported Grade 1, 1.3% Grade 2 and 0.6% Grade 4 reduction in neutrophils. 5.1% shifted 
from Baseline 0 to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1, 1.0% shifted to 
Grade 2 and 0.3% shifted to grade 3. In the placebo group 1.2% reported a CTCAE Grade 1 and 1.2% 
Grade 2 reduction in neutrophils. In Pool S2, 5.7% reported CTCAE Grade 1, 4.7% Grade 2, 0.8% 
Grade 3 and 0.1% Grade 4 decreases in neutrophils. 
In Pool S1, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs reported in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group was 
0.7%; (EAIR: 2.4/100 PYs). In Pool S2, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs in the Phase 2/3 
bimekizumab Total group was 1.2%; (EAIR: 1.2/100 participant-years). Of these, 3 participants had 
Grade 3 and 2 participants had neutrophil Grade 4 value. There were no SAEs. One TEAE was reported 
as severe. None of the patients with Grade 3 neutropenia had reports of concurrent serious infections.  
In the Pool S2 Safety Update the EAIR for neutropenia TEAEs (1.0/100 PYs) was lower than that in the 
original MAA submission (1.2/100 PYs). The 2 additional neutropenia TEAEs reported were for two 
study participants. Both events were non-serious and transient. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Haemoglobin and platelets  
The majority of Shift from Baselines in Pool S1 were to CTCAE Grade 1 and Grade 2. The changes in 
values in both haematology parameters were similar in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W compared to the 
placebo groups. In Pool S2 Phase 2/3 BKZ Total (N=1789) there were 6 (0.3%) Grade 3 and 1 
(<0.1%) grade 4 reductions in haemoglobin (Hb). There were no markedly abnormal haemoglobin 
values in Pool S1. In Pool S2 there were 2 report of Hb <8.0g/dl and 1 report of platelet low 
(<50x109/L). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs related to abnormal haematology values within the ‘Investigations 
and Blood and lymphatic system disorders’ SOCs were related to neutropenia (see Adverse Event of 
Special Interest) 
The  results  from  the  Pool  S2  Safety  Update  were  similar  to  those  of  Pool  S2  in  the  original  MAA 
submission. The majority of the shifts from Baseline values were small, transient and not considered to 
be clinically relevant.

Biochemistry laboratory values 
In Pool S1, mean and median changes in biochemistry laboratory values (Observed and Change from 
Baseline)  for Calcium (mmol/L), Chloride (mmol/L) and Sodium (mmol/L) for BKZ 320mg Q4W 
(N=670) were generally small and similar to placebo; and not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Similarly, for Creatinine, (umol/L) mean and median changes in biochemistry laboratory values 
(Observed and Change from Baseline) were small and similar between BKZ 320mg Q4W and placebo 
treated groups.  
In Pool S2 in general, the percentage of study participants with shifts from Baseline to 
minimum/maximum post-Baseline values in any biochemistry parameter was similar between 
treatment groups.  
In the Pool S2 Safety update, the results were similar to those in the original MAA submission. 6.4% of 
study participants in Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group reported any treatment-emergent markedly 
abnormal (TEMA) biochemistry laboratory value compared with 5.6% in the original MAA submission. 
Glucose (mmol/L) 
In the BKZ 320mg Q4W (N=670) group, 165 (24.6%) recorded high glucose values. Of these 30 
(4.5%) shifted from normal to high values during the study. A total of 38 (22.5%) of the placebo 
treated group reported high glucose levels. Of these 3.6% developed high readings during treatment. 
In the BKZ 320mg Q4W (N=670) group there was a very modest increasing trend from the baseline in 
blood glucose level apart from week 16 when a slight decrease from mean baseline was reported. A 
similar picture was seen in the placebo group. 
In Pool S1, in terms of markedly abnormal biochemistry values, the most frequently reported 
biochemistry value was high glucose (bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group [3.9%] and the placebo group 
[3.6%], respectively.  In Pool S2 the most frequently reported TEMA biochemistry value was high 
glucose (4.0%). In The updated Pool S2 safety analysis the TEMA value for Glucose was 4.8%. 
Potassium (mmol/L) 
Potassium high (>6.0 mmol/L) was reported in Pool S1 bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group [0.7%] and 
the placebo group [0%], respectively) and S2 (0.8%). 
Lipid profile  
The impact of bimekizumab on lipid profile during the induction and maintenance periods has been 
provided by the applicant. Total cholesterol levels were measured only in Phase 2 studies PS0010, 
PS0011, PS0016, and PS0018 (total cholesterol was not fractionated into low density lipoprotein [LDL] 
or very low density lipoprotein [VLDL]). No study participants had markedly abnormal (Grade 3 or 4) 
total cholesterol values at any point in time up to 76 weeks. In Pool S2 the number of TEAEs of blood 
cholesterol increased and hypercholesterolaemia were low: 8 (0.4%) reported blood cholesterol 
increased and 10 (0.6%) reported hypercholesterolaemia. None of these events were serious or 
severe, and none led to study discontinuation. 
Safety in special populations 
The safety analysis of intrinsic factors included an evaluation of TEAEs by age, gender, race, and body 
weight. Extrinsic factors included evaluations by geographic region. The subgroups assessed were age, 
gender, and race (for Pool S1 and Pool S2), and body weight (Pool S2 only). Within the body weight 
category, an additional analysis by dosing regimen (Pool S2C) was presented.

Age 
In Pool S1 in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, the older age group (≥65 years: (70.9%)) had a 
higher incidence of TEAEs compared with the younger groups <40 yrs: (59.8%) and >=40-64 yrs: 
(56.3%). This trend was not observed in the placebo group. The highest difference (≥5%) in 
bimekizumab-treated study participants was observed in the SOC of ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders’ (<40 years), 40 to <65 years, and ≥65 years: 9.2%, 11.7%, 20.0%) which was mainly 
driven by the HLT Dermatitis and eczema (<40 years), 40 to <65 years, and ≥65 years: 1.6%, 3.6%, 
7.3%). Although there was no clear pattern of an increase in TEAES across age groups in the SOC of 
Infections and infestations 40.6%, 32.0%, 41.8%) Candida infections (7.6%; 8.5%; 18.2% 
respectively) mainly driven by the increase in oral candidiasis were increased in the ≥65 years group. 
In the longer term S2 Pool, there was a trend towards increase in TEAES with increasing age. In Pool 
S2, in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group, the overall incidence of TEAEs was 80.6% and 82.1%, 
respectively in the <40 years and 40 to <65 year age group and slightly higher in the ≥65 years group 
(86.3%). There was a higher overall incidence of TEAEs (≥5%) in the ≥65 years group compared to 
<40 yrs and >=40-64 yrs, in the SOCs of ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (32.7%, 16.4% and 
20.5% respectively) and ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’ (22.2%, 10.9% and 16.0% 
respectively). These differences were driven by the HLTs Dermatitis and eczema (17.0%, 5.5%, 10.7% 
and respectively) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain and discomfort (7.8%, 3.8% and 
5.4% respectively). 
In the Pool S2 Safety Update a higher incidence of TEAEs was also observed in the elderly age group 
≥65 years group compared to <40 yrs and >=40-64 yrs age groups, in the SOCs of ‘Eye disorders’, 
‘Metabolism and nutrition disorders’, ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’, ‘Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)’, ‘Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders’, and ‘Vascular disorders’. These differences were driven by HLTs cataract conditions, 
diabetes mellitus (incl subtypes), joint related signs and symptoms, musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue pain and discomfort, osteoarthropathies, dermatitis and eczema, pruritus NEC, rosaceas, skin 
preneoplastic conditions NEC and vascular hypertensive disorders NEC. Incidences of TEAEs were 
higher in the updated Pool S2 analysis compared to the original S2 analysis due to the longer 
exposure. 
Study participants ≥65 years of age in Pool S2 were further stratified using age categories of <65 
years, 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and ≥85 years. There 18 participants>75 years of age and none 
above 85 years of age. There was a trend towards an increase in serious cases across age groups 
(5.9% <65 yrs, 14.1% 65 to 74 years and 11.1% 75 to 84yrs respectively).  
Gender 
The majority of bimekizumab-treated study participants were male (72.2% in Pool S1 and 70.0% in 
Pool S2.) In Pool S1, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in females than in males in both bimekizumab 
and placebo study participants. Treatment-emergent AEs with a notably higher incidence in females 
were observed in the ‘Infections and infestations’ SOC: 71.5% vs 59.6% respectively. ‘Upper 
respiratory tract infections’ (40.8% vs 34.3%), ‘Urinary tract infections’ (11.4% vs 2%),  ‘Candida 
infections’ (19.2% vs 16.1%) and ‘Injection site reactions’ were more commonly reported in females 
(5.4%) than men (2.2%). In the Pool S2 safety update the trends for TEAEs by gender were consistent 
with those observed in the original MAA submission. 
Race 
Most study participants treated with bimekizumab were White (82%), 2% were Black and 16% were 
classified as other. The most frequently reported TEAEs in White and other study participants were in 
the SOCs of Infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
Bimzelx - Assessment report

Page 184/220 
 
 
 
disorders. Noticeable differences were noted in the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC for the 
HLT Dermatitis and eczema (≥5%) where the incidence was higher in the other study participants 
compared with White study participants. In the Pool S2 safety update the trends for TEAEs by race 
were consistent with those observed in the original MAA submission. 
Body Weight 
In Pool S2, (Phase 2/3 BKZ population) the incidence of TEAEs by body weight for the categories: 
<70kg, ≥70 to <95kg, ≥95 to <115kg, and ≥115kg was 83.6%, 80.1%, 80% and 89.8% respectively. 
Heavier study participants had a higher incidence of TEAEs (≥5%) compared with participants of lower 
body weights particularly in the 4 SOCs of Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (11.7%, 
11.2%, 9.1%, and 21.4%,respectively), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (0.8%, 4.9%, 7.0%, and 
8.7%, respectively), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (12.3%, 15.1%, 14.2%, and 
18.0%, respectively, and Vascular disorders (2.2%, 5.4%, 7.5%, and 12.1%, respectively). Lower 
body weight patients had more Candida infections than higher body weight patients did. The incidence 
of SAEs by body weight for the categories: <70kg, ≥70 to <95kg, ≥95 to <115kg, and ≥115kg was 
5.0%, 4.9% 9.6% and 9.7% respectively 
The incidence of severe TEAEs by body weight for the categories: <70kg, ≥70 to <95kg, ≥95 to 
<115kg, and ≥115kg was 5.0%, 5.4%, 7.2% and 10.2% respectively. 
Table 46 - Overview of TEAEs by body weight during the combined Initial, Maintenance, and 
OLE Treatment Period (Pool S2) 
The increase in serious and severe TEAEs in heavier study participants was most marked in the 
Infections and infestations SOC without any clear pattern.  
Further analyses by body weight based on Pool S2C were presented using weight categories of ≤120kg 
and >120kg.  
Some differences between the Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and the Q8W group were noted for 
the ≤120kg and >120kg weight categories. The incidence of TEAEs was slightly lower in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (73.0%) compared with the Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group 
(76.7%) in the ≤120kg weight category and higher in the >120kg weight category (85.0% vs 76.0%, 
respectively). Slightly higher incidences of drug-related TEAEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W group (28.6%) compared to the Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q8W group (25.9%) were 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 185/220 
 
 
 
 
observed in the ≤120kg weight category, while the incidence was similar in the >120kg weight 
category (35.0% and 36.0%, respectively). 
In the Q4W dosing regimen, the incidence of TEAEs were similar in both body weight groups (≤120kg 
and >120kg) for the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, and Vascular disorders and for HLTs of Candida infections and Bacterial infections NEC. In 
the ≤120kg body weight group, a higher incidence of TEAEs (≥5%) was observed in the SOC of 
Investigations. The HLT Dermatitis and eczema was also higher in the lower weight group.  
In the heavier body weight (>120kg) group, a difference of ≥10% was observed in SOCs of Infections 
and infestations, Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, and a difference ≥2.5% was 
observed in the SOCs of Metabolism and nutrition disorders, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders. 
In the Q8W dosing regimen, study participants in the higher body weight group (>120kg) tended to 
have a higher incidence (≥5%) at SOC level for TEAEs in Metabolism and nutrition disorders, 
Gastrointestinal disorders, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Vascular disorders, and 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. At HLT level, incidences were higher (≥5%) for the 
heavy weight group for Candida infections, Bacterial infections NEC, and Dermatitis and eczema. The 
≤120kg body weight group had more TEAEs (≥5%) in the SOC of Infections and infestations and 
Investigations, as well as a higher incidence (≥2.5%) of events related to Injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications. 
In S2 Pool Safety Update, similar to the original S2 analysis, heavier study participants had a higher 
incidence of TEAEs (≥5%) compared with participants of lower body weights particularly in the 4 SOCs 
of Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders, and Vascular disorders. These differences (≥5%) were most 
noticeable in the HLT Vascular hypertensive disorders NEC. 
Of note, lower body weight study participants had more Candida infections than higher body weight 
participants did. There was a tendency for more serious and severe TEAEs in heavier study participants 
driven by the Infections and infestations SOC without any clear pattern, and more drug-related TEAEs 
in lower body weight participants driven by the HLT Candida infections.  
Pregnancy 
A total of 11 maternal bimekizumab exposure pregnancies have been reported in the studies included 
in Pool S2. Five pregnancies resulted in the live birth of a healthy baby, 2 pregnancies ended due to 
spontaneous abortion during the first trimester, 1 induced abortion was performed during the first 
trimester, and 3 pregnancies were ongoing. No congenital anomalies were reported. One new serious 
TEAE of haemorrhage in pregnancy was reported in one subject, but outcome was unknown and no 
further information could be obtained. There are no safety data regarding exposure during lactation 
available. 
Immunological events 
The number of study participants who became ADAb positive for the first time increased with duration 
of treatment and repeat dosing with bimekizumab in both of the tested dosing regimens.  
During the Initial Treatment Period (Pool S3), the overall incidence of ADAb was 22.6%. During the 
combined Initial and Maintenance Treatment Period (Pool S2A), the incidence of ADAb was 37.6% 
following a year of treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and 45.1% (116 of 257 participants) 
following a year of treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 186/220 
 
 
 
The total number of study participants who were ADAb positive for the first time seemed to saturate by 
Week 28 in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and by Week 36 in the bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W/Q8W group, with few study participants becoming positive after these time points. 
TEAEs were most frequently reported in ADAb-positive (EAIR 12.4/100 PYs) study participants 
compared to first those who had an ADAb-positive result starting before the AE (9.8/100 PYs) and 
ADAb-negative patients (EAIR 7.8/100PYs). In all groups, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the 
SOCs of Infections, infestations, Skin, and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Dermatitis and eczema were 
slightly higher for AEs starting on/after the first ADAb-positive result (7.0%) compared with AEs 
starting before the first ADAb-positive result (3.5%), and similar to the group who was always ADAb 
negative (6.3%). The EAIR of TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was highest in the groups 
whose AEs started before the first ADAb-positive result (EAIR: 152.2/100 PYs) and on/after the first 
ADAb-positive result EAIR 142.6/100PY compared with always negative ADAb and EAIR: 120.5/100 
PYs. 
Across the Phase 3 studies in Pool S2A, 14.6% (91 of 625 participants) on bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
throughout and 15.6% (40 of 257 participants) on bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W were positive for 
antibodies that neutralize the binding of bimekizumab to its IL-17 target. The overall incidence of 
TEAEs and EAIRs were higher in study participants who were overall NAb-positive: 87.3% (N=150 
study participants; EAIR: 277.6/100-participant-years) compared with 82.1% (N=262 study 
participants; EAIR: 229.0/100-participant-years) in study participants who were overall NAb-negative. 
Treatment-emergent AEs in overall NAb-negative and overall NAb-positive participants were most 
frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders. Study participants who were overall NAb-negative had a greater incidence of TEAEs in the 
HLT of Candida infections compared with study participants who were overall NAb-positive (21.0% 
[EAIR: 25.1/100 PYs] vs 14.0% [EAIR: 16.5/100 PYs]).   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction study with bimekizumab has been conducted.  
In PS0008, study participants switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab treatment without a washout 
period as per study design. Overall, there appeared to be a generally similar safety profile and no 
unexpected safety findings in study participants who switched directly from adalimumab to 
bimekizumab at Week 24 relative to study participants who received continuous bimekizumab 
treatment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Pool S1, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was 1.6%; EAIR: 5.3/100 PYs in the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group compared with 4.1%; EAIR: 13.8/100 PYs the placebo group. TEAEs 
leading to study discontinuation reported by >1 study participant in any treatment group, were eczema 
in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (0.3%) and psoriasis in the placebo group (1.8%). In Pool S2, 
the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was low overall (4.1%; EAIR: 4.3/100 PYs) and were 
most frequently reported in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (1.0%), Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (0.9%), and Investigations (0.7%). The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation by PT were hepatic enzyme increased and psoriasis in 4 study participants (0.3%) 
each. 
In the Pool S2 Safety Update, the EAIRs for TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab Total group (3.8/100 participant-years) was lower than that in the original MAA 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 187/220 
 
 
 
submission (4.3/100 participant-years). A total of 16 additional TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 
reported. The most common additional TEAEs leading to discontinuation were psoriasis and colon 
cancer, each reported by 2 study participants in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group.

Not applicable.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data from 8 phase 2, phase 3 and OLE studies in PSO (PS0010, PS0011, PS0016, PS0018, 
PS0008, PS0009, PS0013, and PS0014) were pooled to summarize the safety of bimekizumab. For 
studies PS0008, PS0009, and PS0013 treatment periods up to Week 52 or Week 56 were completed. A 
small number of study participants were still in the safety follow up (SFU) period at the time of the cut-
off date for the individual studies. Regarding the open-label study PS0014, safety data were included 
through the cut-off date for the submission (01 November 2019). Upon request by CHMP, the 
Applicant issued on 19 October 2020, the 120-Day Safety Update report which provided 5.5 months of 
additional long-term safety data from the open-label extension (OLE) study (PS0014) up to the 
designated clinical cut-off date (15 April 2020).  
Patient Exposure 
1789 patients were treated with bimekizumab. As of the 120-Day Safety Update clinical cut-off date, 
the total time at risk was 2424.7 participant-years (PY) in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group 
compared with 1830.4 PY in the original MAA submission. A total of 1371 study participants (compared 
with 1073 study participants in the original MAA submission) were exposed to bimekizumab for ≥12 
months at any dose, out of which 214 study participants (compared with 59 in the original MAA 
submission) were treated with the maintenance dose of bimekizumab 320mg Q8W for ≥12 months 
which helps further characterise the long term safety of the 320mg Q8W maintenance regimen. The 
study duration for active comparators was 52 weeks for ustekinumab and 24 weeks for adalimumab 
and included a total of 163 and 159 study participants (156.4 and 72.6 participant-years respectively). 
A total of 2178 subjects have been exposed to bimekizumab across all indications accounting for a 
total of 1932.7 participant-years of exposure. Overall exposure exceeded the ICH E1 safety exposure 
requirements of >1500 patients exposed, 300 to 600 for 6 months, > 100 for 1 year and is considered 
adequate to characterize more frequently reported ADRs.  
Safety pools 
The safety of bimekizumab was assessed using 5 main integrated datasets (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5). 
The focus was primarily based on the 8 Studies in participants with moderate to severe PSO included in 
the S1 and S2 integrated safety sets.  
In pool S1, evaluating safety over the 16 weeks initial treatment period, only 2 of the pivotal phase 3 
studies were pooled (P0009 and P00013) on the basis that they had similar study designs and were 
placebo-controlled through Week 16. In the original pool S1, 670 study participants received 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W compared with placebo (n=169). In response to a concern regarding the 
completeness of Pool S1 (including only Week 16 data from placebo-controlled periods of studies 
PS0009 and PS0013), the applicant included additional exposure and safety data from the 16-week 
Treatment Period of PS0008 (active-comparator-controlled study with adalimumab) and from the 12-
week Treatment Period of PS0010 (placebo and bimekizumab 320mg every 4 weeks [Q4W] treatment 
arms) to create a new Pool S1C across PS008, PS0009, PS0010/11 and PS0013.  
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 188/220 
 
 
 
Pool S2 which included data from all blinded phase 2 and 3 studies and their respective extension 
studies investigated long-term exposure. The “Phase 2/3” treatment group included data from all study 
participants while treated with bimekizumab during PS0010, PS0011, PS0016, PS0018, PS0008, 
PS0009, PS0013, and PS0014 up to a cut-off point of the 20th April 2020. Comparative data with 
ustekinumab and adalimumab were also provided in this analysis. However, the duration of exposure 
varied considerably. The duration of exposure for comparators was limited to Week 52 for ustekinumab 
and to Week 24 for adalimumab which led to a large imbalance in PYs of exposure between 
bimekizumab and these comparators.  Safety data collected during the randomized withdrawal from 
bimekizumab in Study PS0013 was not included in Pool S2. No new safety concerns were identified 
with maintenance of response (through Week 56) on continued bimekizumab dosing versus withdrawal 
of bimekizumab (placebo) as outlined in the CSR for Study PS0013. 
In Safety Pool S5 which combines PSO data with data from other indications in the bimekizumab 
programme, no new safety concerns were identified.  
Overall, the patients recruited to the phase 2 and 3 studies included in Pool S1 and Pool S2 had 
moderate to severe plaque PSO, poorly controlled by topical treatments and or systemic treatments. 
Patients recruited had high levels of background morbidity. Over 80% reported a previous or ongoing 
medical condition at baseline. As expected, hypertension, obesity hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus were the most commonly reported conditions. Baseline morbidity and co-morbidity, as well as 
use of concomitant medications were generally well balanced between the study groups, throughout 
the studies. There was some slight variability in baseline rates of hypertension and gastro-oesophageal 
reflux in bimekizumab patients compared to placebo. However, these imbalances are unlikely to have 
any impact on the interpretation of safety findings. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAES) 
The most frequently reported AEs (at least 1% higher than the placebo group) were infections and 
infestations and were more common in the bimekizumab treated patients compared to placebo (20.4% 
vs 6.6%), with nasopharyngitis (9.4%), oral candidiasis (7.6%) being the most common events in BKZ 
treated patients in this SOC.  
The short term safety profile is in line with the expected safety profile for a medication targeting IL-
17A and IL-17F and its impact on muco-epidermal immunity resulting in impaired host defences 
against extracellular bacteria and fungi at mucosal surfaces with small imbalances in incidence by HLT 
observed for Upper respiratory tract infections, Candida infections, Skin structures and soft tissue 
infections, Fungal Infections NEC, Abdominal and gastrointestinal infections, bacterial infection NEC, 
Viral infections NEC, Herpes viral infections, Dental and oral soft tissue infections, Ear infections, and 
Tinea infections. 
The most common TEAEs reported ≥1% Higher than the Placebo Group were Nasopharyngitis, Oral 
candidiasis, Pharyngitis, Folliculitis, Tinea Pedis, Oropharyngeal candidiasis, Headache. 
The long-term safety of bimekizumab (Pool S2 updated), over 48 weeks of treatment, was mainly 
similar to the 16 week initial treatment period (Pool S1C). There was no evidence of a clinically 
relevant increase in TEAEs with increased exposure. 
The most frequently reported SOCs over longer term use were SOCs of Infections and infestations, 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and Gastrointestinal disorders. At the PT level, the most 
frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, and upper respiratory tract infection.  
Upon request by CHMP, long term safety data collected during the randomised withdrawal from 
bimekizumab (bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/placebo group re-randomized to withdrawal from 
bimekizumab) were provided. No new safety concerns were identified with maintenance of response 
(through Week 56) on continued bimekizumab dosing versus withdrawal of bimekizumab (placebo).

Devices related side effects 
No unexpected events were observed in the safety profile of the study participants that received across 
both device sub studies. The overall safety profile was consistent with the Phase 3 pivotal studies, 
which used the bimekizumab-TN syringe. In DV0002, a total of 8 injection site reaction (ISR) AEs (4 
with bimekizumab-SS-1mL and 4 with bimekizumab-AI-1mL) were reported across 6 study 
participants. All were assessed as not device-related, not serious, not severe, and did not lead to 
discontinuation. There was some variability in the reporting of ISR, with increased reports for subjects 
administered the Q8W regimen. Nevertheless, the differences between treatment Q4W and Q8W 
groups are difficult to interpret due to the small numbers. Although self-injection of bimekizumab using 
the bimekizumab-SS-1mL or the bimekizumab-AI-1mL was well-tolerated, the applicant was requested 
by CHMP to continue monitoring AE reporting rates by device with particular emphasis on ISR, in 
future PSURs. No further update to the SmPC or RMP was deemed necessary by CHMP.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
The incidence of any SAE in bimekizumab treated patients was lower than placebo (1.6% vs 2.4%) in 
Pool S1. No particular pattern of concern was identified for Pool S1C. For Pool S2, the incidence of 
SAEs was higher at 6.4%. This was lower than the ustekinumab group (7.3%) but higher than 
adalimumab group (3.1%).  
SAEs were most commonly reported in GI, infections and infestations, Musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications and Nervous system disorders SOCs. Most SAEs were 
single occurrences of SAEs apart from acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, cellulitis, and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus were reported by 3 study participants (0.2% each) in the Phase 3 
bimekizumab Total group. The previously described heavy co-morbidity at baseline is likely to have 
contributed to many of the SAEs. Overall the safety profile is similar to other similar products in the 
same class. The EAIR for SAEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group (6.2/100 PY) was lower than 
that in the original MAA submission (6.8/100 PY) and therefore does not indicate an increase in risk 
with longer exposure to bimekizumab. 
Of 8 deaths, 5 were reported in bimekizumab-treated study participants. All of the deaths occurred in 
the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group. Two fatal events in the bimekizumab group were adjudicated as 
MACE: one was adjudicated as sudden cardiac death (PT: cardiac arrest) and 1 was adjudicated as 
other CV death (PT: cardiopulmonary failure); both occurred in study participants with significant CV 
risk factors. Both events were considered not related to bimekizumab by Investigators. One additional 
death was reported in the Pool S2 safety update and was adjudicated as MACE. None of the deaths 
were considered to be related to study medication. Overall the mortality rate with bimekizumab has 
been shown to be similar to the background rate in PSO and to mortality rates in the general 
populations of the EU and the US.  
There was no clear pattern of SAE distribution across SOCs for either of the 2 maintenance treatment 
regimens. 
Safety topics of interest  
Infections 
Increased risk of infections is an identified risk associated with IL-17 inhibitors. Despite a higher rate of 
infection-related  TEAEs  in  bimekizumab  treatment  group  compared  with  placebo  within  the  pivotal 
studies initial treatment period (16 weeks) the majority of infections were non-serious, mild to moderate 
in  intensity,  and  did  not  lead  to  study  drug  discontinuation.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increase  in 
infections with greater exposure. 
Serious Infections 
In Pool S1, the incidence rate of serious infections in bimekizumab-treated study participants was low 
and no study participant experienced a serious infection while receiving placebo. However, populations 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 190/220 
 
 
 
with a current or recent history of serious infection were excluded from trials. In Pool S2, the incidence 
of serious infections remained low in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group and was comparable to 
ustekinumab and adalimumab treated patients.  
Skin infections 
Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections under different HLTs and SOCs that are likely to be staphylococcal 
in origin were reviewed. There was no evidence of an increased risk of skin infections.  
Opportunistic infections (including TB) 
No reactivation of TB in study participants with a history of latent TB was observed in the PSO 
development programme and no study participant developed active TB. Overall, there was no evidence 
of any patients converting to active TB infection in the studies. The proposed warnings in section 4.3 
and 4.4 of the SmPC and further follow up in studies PS0014 and PS0015 and the planned 
Bimekizumab real-world outcomes study is endorsed by CHMP as agreed in the RMP. 
Opportunistic infections were mainly localized fungal events classified as opportunistic. In Pool S2, the 
proportion of study participants reporting a fungal infection TEAE was noticeably higher in the 
bimekizumab Total group (EAIR: 26.0/100 PY) compared to ustekinumab (EAIR: 2.6) and adalimumab 
(EAIR: 1.4) groups. In particular, oral candidiasis and tinea pedis were more commonly reported for 
bimekizumab compared to ustekinumab or adalimumab. However, the different extent of exposure 
across the treatment groups need to be taken into consideration. These cases were generally mild to 
moderate in severity and resolved, however 7 study participants all of whom developed oro-mucosal 
candidiasis (oral candidiasis (3 participants), oesophageal candidiasis (2 participants), oropharyngitis 
fungal and oropharyngeal candidiasis (1 participant each) did discontinue treatment due to the fungal 
infection. One serious, opportunistic fungal infection (oesophageal candidiasis) was reported with 
bimekizumab in the original analysis and a further serious event of ophthalmic herpes zoster was 
reported in the S2 safety follow up analysis. This case was severe, related to IMP, resolved, but did not 
lead to discontinuation. From the clinical studies, no clearly defined subgroup could be identified that 
would benefit from prophylactic antifungal use. 
An increased susceptibility to candida infections in particular for oropharyngeal forms of candidiasis has 
been  identified  with  a  trend  towards  higher  Candida  infection  rates  in  the  higher  plasma  exposure 
associated  with  bimekizumab  320mg  Q4W  group.  Section  4.8  includes  oral  candidiasis  and  tinea 
infections as ADRs. Warnings in section 4.4 regarding the risk of infections and monitoring of infections 
are considered adequate. Section 4.3 has been updated to include clinically important active infections 
(e.g. active tuberculosis) as a contraindication. Serious infections is included as an important identified 
risk in the RMP and will be further evaluated as part of ongoing studies PS0014 and PS0015 and as part 
of  the  planned  Bimekizumab  real  world  outcomes  PASS  study  as  agreed  in  the  RMP.  Furthermore, 
additional  information  have  been  included  in  section  4.8  regarding  increased  reports  of  candida  in 
patients with a lower body weight and the elderly. This is endorsed by CHMP. 
Malignancies 
Incidences of malignant tumour TEAEs were low in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group (0.8%; 
EAIR: 0.8/100 PY) similar to low incidences reported in the ustekinumab (0.6%; EAIR: 0.6/100 PY) 
and adalimumab (0.6%; EAIR: 1.4/100 PY) treatment groups. However, it is difficult to compare 
across groups as the extent of exposure in terms of 100 PY varied significantly across the three 
groups. Limited duration of exposure in the Pool S2 studies does not permit an accurate assessment of 
any effect of duration of treatment with bimekizumab on the risk of malignancy. 
The most commonly reported cases were non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Eight cases of NMSC 
were reported (7 events of Basal cell, 1 event each squamous cell carcinoma and Keratoacanthoma.) 
An increased background risk of NMSC has been previously reported in patients with PSO and 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 191/220 
 
 
 
especially in patients who have received psoralen and UV-A (PUV-A) therapy. Nevertheless, it is agreed 
with the applicant that there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of malignancy overall in 
bimekizumab-treated study participants or evidence that bimekizumab-treated participants with prior 
phototherapy are at higher risk of skin malignancies in the safety data presented as part of this 
application. 
Four of the TEAEs for a specific malignant tumour reported with bimekizumab treatment were in the 
gastrointestinal tract: colon cancer, gastric cancer and anal squamous cell carcinoma. The majority of 
cases (3/4 cases) were reported with a time to onset of a few days or months or presented with 
metastatic disease which suggests that such malignancies were likely to be pre-existing. Six additional 
malignancies (colon cancer (2 participants), colon cancer metastatic, squamous cell carcinoma of skin 
(2 participants), and bronchial carcinoma) were reported in the S2 Safety follow up analysis. Despite 
these additional reports, the EAIR for any malignancy (0.8/100 PY) is the same as that in the original 
MAA submission, however within this there is a small increase in malignancies (excluding Non-
melanomic Skin Cancers): EAIR increased from 0.4 to 0.5. This is driven by an increase in colon cancer 
TEAEs (EAIR increased from 0.1 to 0.2) and possibly indicates an increase in risk with longer exposure 
to bimekizumab. Nevertheless, the observed time is still limited considering the length of tumour 
induction. Causality assessment is confounded by the overall increased risk for cancer development in 
PSO and underlying risk factors in all cases. It is agreed that there is currently insufficient information 
to support inclusion of a warning regarding malignancy in the SmPC. In order to further characterise 
this risk, Malignancy is included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be carefully 
evaluated in the category 3 Bimekizumab Real-World Outcomes PASS study and in ongoing safety 
studies (PS0014 and PS0015). In addition, Malignancy, with particular reference to colon cancer will be 
monitored carefully as an item of special interest in future PSURs.  
MACE 
In Pool S1 the overall incidence of MACE, extended MACE and other CV events were low. In Pool S2 
the overall incidence of MACE and extended MACE remained low. In the S2 Safety Update, although 2 
additional adjudicated MACE were reported, the EAIR was lower compared with the original MAA 
submission. There was no increase in risk with the additional 5.5 months exposure to bimekizumab. 
The most frequently reported MACE was myocardial infarction. No MACE was observed in the placebo 
group in the Pool S1 analysis or for active comparator groups in Pool S2 analysis. Differences in 
incidence of MACE between BKZ and active comparator groups are difficult to interpret due large 
imbalances in patient-years of exposure. The overall rate of MACE with bimekizumab was comparable 
to rates observed with other 1L-17 inhibitors approved for treatment of PSO published in the literature.  
Mean changes from Baseline in ECG variables were generally small and similar between treatment 
groups. No notable trends were observed in the post-baseline ECG outlier values across all treatment 
groups in Pool S1. In addition to TEAEs related to ECG measurements, review was performed for TEAEs 
of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, syncope, and seizures to evaluate potential clinical 
consequences of severe arrhythmias. Overall, the incidences of those TEAEs were low and their review 
did not indicate a safety concern. 
Taking into consideration the background cardiovascular morbidity in this group, there is no indication 
of an increase in MACE that could be attributed to treatment with bimekizumab. MACE is included as 
an important potential risk in the RMP and will be further assessed as part of ongoing studies (PS0014 
and PS0015) and Bimekizumab Real-World Outcomes PASS study. This is endorsed by the CHMP. 
Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) 
An increased prevalence of IBD among PSO patients compared with the general population is well-
established. One study participant who was treated with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group in the 
induction period reported an IBD TEAE (colitis ulcerative). Cases of new or exacerbations of IBD have 
been reported with IL-17 inhibitors. A case of gastrointestinal inflammation that was thought to 
possibly be early Crohn’s disease was reported in the S2 Safety update report. A revised warning 
regarding IBD has been included in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. IBD (Crohn’s disease and 
ulcerative colitis) will continue to be monitored as important potential risk in the RMP and will be 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 192/220 
 
 
 
further evaluated as part of ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015) and Bimekizumab Real-World 
Outcomes PASS study. 
Suicide and Depression 
Overall, despite these 4 cases (1SIB and 3 severe depression) being considered to be related to study 
medication and three subjects being withdrawn from the study, taking into consideration the higher 
background rates of suicidal ideation and depression in patients with PSO, there was no clear indication 
of an increased risk of development or worsening depression and anxiety or suicidality (thoughts or 
behaviours) following treatment with bimekizumab.  
Neutropenia 
In Pool S1, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs reported in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group was 
(0.7%; EAIR: 2.4/100 PY) and included the PT neutrophil count decreased (0.4%; EAIR: 1.4/100 PY). 
No neutropenia cases were reported in placebo group. 
In Pool S2, the incidence of neutropenia TEAEs in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group was 1.2%; 
EAIR: 1.2/100 PYs. In general, neutropenia was transient, and was not associated with an increased 
frequency of infections. There were no SAEs associated with neutropenia. One severe case resulted in 
discontinuation of bimekizumab. There is a slight increase in neutropenia TEAEs with longer duration of 
treatment (Pool S1 EAIR 0.7 vs Pool S2 1.2) however in the S2 safety follow up analysis, the EAIR for 
neutropenia TEAEs (1.0/100 PYs) was lower than that in the original MAA submission (1.2/100 PYs). 
No serious infections emerged within 30 days of a CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4 low neutrophil value. The 
incidence of TEAES observed in bimekizumab treated patients neutrophil counts were similar to the 
adalimumab and ustekinumab groups in Pool S2. Neutropenia is included as an uncommon side effect 
in section 4.8 and will be followed-up as part of ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015) and 
Bimekizumab Real-World Outcomes PASS study as part of the safety concern ‘serious infection’ 
included as an important identified risk in the RMP.  
Hepatic Function 
Six TEAEs (5 in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and 1 in placebo group) were assessed as drug-related 
by the Investigator. All TEAEs resolved. Only one study participant in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
group discontinued the study due to hepatic enzyme increased. 
In Pool S2, 5.5% of study participants in the Phase 2/3 bimekizumab Total group experienced hepatic 
TEAEs. The majority were reports of laboratory abnormalities (HLT Liver function analyses 4.8%). Most 
other reports related to Non-alcoholic fatty liver (0.4%) but there was 3 reports of drug-induced liver 
injury, and 2 reports of liver injury, reported in BKZ treated patients. The percentage of patients 
treated with BKZ Q4W reporting markedly abnormal liver function results was low (2.7%). A total of 24 
reports linked to abnormal liver function that resulted in pts discontinuing from the phase 2/3 studies. 
The majority of the TEAEs leading to discontinuation (15/24 events) occurred in the Phase 2b study 
PS0010 and its extension study PS0011, where due stringent withdrawal criteria in the phase 2 clinical 
trials.  
The incidence of TEAEs (HLT Liver function analyses) was slightly higher in the Phase 3 bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W group (2.9%) compared to 320mg Q8W group (1.6%). Three patients experienced an 
SAE (liver function test increased).  
Upon request from the CHMP, the applicant conducted a review of all cases of potential drug-induced 
liver injury (DILI) identified in Pool S2. In total, twenty cases were identified as potential drug-induced 
liver damage (ALT or AST elevation >5xULN at any point in time, cases meeting Hy’s Law laboratory 
criteria, and cases with a reported term of “drug-induced liver injury). Of these, two met Hy’s Law 
laboratory criteria and it is agreed that following alternative diagnoses (cholelithiasis with possibly a 
migrating gallstone and autoimmune hepatitis) neither case are likely to be related to study drug. The 
remaining events had significant confounding factors or alternative diagnoses. Of note two of the cases 
were associated with concomitant treatment with fluconazole. Overall no signal of hepatoxicity 
associated with treatment with Bimekizumab and no hepatotoxic effect with IL-17 AF inhibition has 
been identified in the literature.

Biochemistry values 
A significant proportion of participant reported high glucose values at baseline and reported high 
maximum values during the study. This is likely to reflect the increased incidence of metabolic 
syndrome and Type 2 diabetes as co-morbidities in PSO.  
The impact of bimekizumab on total cholesterol measured only in Phase 2 studies has been provided 
for review. No TEMA ≥Grade 3 cholesterol values were reported in any of the studies. In a review of 
TEAEs for raised cholesterol in the S2 safety population, 8 cases (0.4%) of blood cholesterol increased 
and 10 (0.6%) of hypercholesterolaemia were reported. It is acknowledged that increased cholesterol 
or increases in pro-atherogenic components of the lipid panel have not been identified as side effects 
for other marketed IL-17 inhibitors. Despite the limitation of the dataset, there was no evidence from 
the data presented of increased total cholesterol levels following treatment with bimekizumab. 
Nevertheless, the applicant will continue to monitor pro-atherogenic components of the lipid panel low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) or very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in study PS0015 which is ongoing and 
in which lipid panel, including LDL levels is being measured. Complete results will be provided when 
the final clinical study report will be available (i.e. by 30 May 2023).   
Blood Pressure 
Markedly abnormal increases in SBP and DBP were reported at comparable rates in the bimekizumab 
320mg Q4W and placebo treatment groups (0.9% and 1.8%, respectively). Markedly abnormal SBP 
and DBP rates were <3% in Pool S2. Normal SBP and DBP values were maintained in >98% of study 
participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group and >96% of study participants in the placebo 
group despite the fact that more than 30% of study participants had a medical history of hypertension. 
Hypertension was reported as a TEAE in 4.4% of Phase 3 BKZ Total population. Small increases in BP, 
particularly in the patients with other underlying cardiac risk factors can be significant. However, there 
does appear to be a trend towards a greater increase in Stage 1 or 2 hypertension in patients with 
normal BP at baseline treated with BKZ which was identified across the initial 16 week treatment 
period for S1 and is also evident across the longer term S2 analysis. The clinical relevance of this 
overall trend towards elevation of BP particularly in patients with normal BP at baseline is unclear. 
Elevation of BP in patients who are normotensive at baseline will be monitored as a topic of special 
interest/discussed in future PSURs.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In the initial treatment period (Pool S1), hypersensitivity reactions were reported at a higher incidence 
in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group (4.2%) compared with the placebo group (0.6%). The majority 
of hypersensitivity reaction were in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2.8% in the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group vs 0 in the placebo group), mainly from the HLT Dermatitis and 
eczema (eczema (0.9%) and dermatitis contact (0.6%). These were mostly mild to moderate in 
severity and 66.8 % resolved.  
Other hypersensitivity reactions included events in the SOCs of Eye disorders and Respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders and appeared to be mainly linked to seasonal allergies. Drug hypersensitivity 
(7.6%), seasonal allergy (7.6%) were among the most frequently reported medical history conditions 
in the Phase 3 bimekizumab Total group.   
In Pool S2 the majority of hypersensitivity reaction were also in the SOC of Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (8.5%); mainly from the HLT Dermatitis and eczema (6.7%). These were mostly mild 
to moderate in intensity. There was no evidence of an increase in incidence of events reported under 
the HLT of Dermatitis and eczema with time. A significant proportion were considered related to study 
medication. There was only one TEAE of serious atopic dermatitis which occurred >1yr after starting 
treatment. There were three serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic shock, dermatitis atopic, 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 194/220 
 
 
 
and circulatory collapse, respectively). There was no clear evidence of causality with bimekizumab with 
any of the three cases reported. The case of anaphylactic shock was related to a bee-sting.  
Although it is acknowledged that urticaria, conjunctivitis allergic, and rhinitis allergic were the most 
commonly reported TEAES in the overview of hypersensitivity-related TEAEs in Pool S2 (excluding PTs 
from HLT Dermatitis and eczema), there were individual reports of angioedema, swelling face, 
pharyngeal oedema, lip swelling, laryngeal oedema which are suggestive of a more systemic type of 
allergic reaction. 
The increased incidence of cases of eczematous/dermatitic eruptions in PSO patients, particularly 
elderly patients, was further discussed by the applicant upon request by CHMP. Th applicant considered 
that this observation was in line with data from bimekizumab non-clinical studies and related molecules 
from the class. Several hypotheses are discussed exploring possible mechanisms (Th1/Th2 immune 
response, impact on skin microbiome homeostasis, Potential for IL-17C or IL-22 overexpression) for 
the occurrence of eczematous eruptions with anti-IL-17 treatment. The higher incidence in elderly may 
be associated with an age-related decline in skin barrier function. Development of atopic eczema in 
patients with a history of PSO is a potential source of diagnostic confusion.  
Dermatitis and eczema are included as common side effects in section 4.8. Serious hypersensitivity 
reactions are included as an important potential risk with additional wording in SmPC Section 4.3 
(Contraindication). The warning regarding hypersensitivity in section 4.4 has been updated to indicate 
that there have been reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions with other similar type agents. A 
warning, related to serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions observed with 
IL-17 inhibitors, has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. This is agreed by CHMP. 
Injection site reactions (ISR) 
Overall, number of reported ISR was low (3.1%). Furthermore, none were assessed as device-related, 
serious, severe, or led to discontinuation. No association between ISR and ADAbs or NAbs has been 
established. ISR are included as common ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Incidence rates for ISRs 
were similar between the bimekizumab 320 mg Q4W and Q8W treatment regimens (1.1% vs 1.9%). 
Some differences between studies and between treatment Q4W and Q8W groups were noted in the 
device sub studies in Study PS0014.These are difficult to interpret due to the small numbers. 
Nevertheless, the applicant agreed to monitor adverse event reporting rates by device type with 
particular emphasis on ISR, in future PSURs. This is considered adequate by the CHMP.  
Immunogenicity 
The exposure adjusted incidence of TEAEs were higher in study participants who were overall ADAb 
negative. However, the exposure adjusted incidence of infection TEAEs was higher in the ADAb positive 
group. This was due to an increase in folliculitis, oral candidiasis and nasopharyngitis. 
In patients who were Nab positive the overall EAIR of TEAEs were higher than in study participants 
who were overall NAb-negative (EAIR 277.6 vs 229). Exposure adjusted incidence of infection TEAEs 
was higher in the NAb-positive group. This was driven by increases in, otitis externa (4% vs 1.5%), 
URTI (12.7%vs 8.8%), and UTI (6.7% vs 3.8%) in the NAb-positive compared to the NAb-negative 
group. Study participants who were overall NAb-negative had a greater incidence of candidiasis and 
folliculitis compared with study participants who were overall NAb-positive (17.9% vs 12.0% and 5.0% 
vs 3.3% respectively). The applicant suggested that this may be due to incomplete IL-17A and IL-17F 
blockade in NAb-positive study participants. A higher proportion of study participants who were NAb-
positive experienced ISR (3.3% vs 1.5%). Overall, immunogenicity had no direct impact in terms of 
hypersensitivity or allergic type local reactions at injection site but may indirectly pact the side effect 
profile through incomplete IL-17A and IL-17F blockade.  
Upon request from CHMP, the Applicant provided additional data that showed that ADAb titer values 
did not tend to increase with multiple administrations and the variability in titers was generally 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 195/220 
 
 
 
consistent across time. The pooled Phase 3 studies (Pool S2A [combined data from Initial and 
Maintenance Treatment Periods]) indicated that ADAb titer had a limited impact on efficacy at both 
Week 16 and Week 52/56. However, there were a low number of study participants in the antibody 
positive groups at these time points, results are thus difficult to interpret, and no firm conclusions can 
be drawn. As the safety impact of ADAb status on safety is limited, the applicant confirmed that 
samples for anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) will be collected in PS0014 
and their impact on safety and on the SmPC will be further investigated. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
The update of Pool S1 to Pool S1C provided >50% additional data to characterize the safety during the 
initial treatment period (Pool S1C BKZ n=1032 vs n= 670 in original pool S1). No important differences 
compared with the previous Pool S1 analysis were identified. No new ADRs were identified, and there 
was no impact on the proposed ADR frequency categories. Some ADR terms identified in the original 
Pool S1, no longer met the criteria of being at least 1% higher than placebo (toothache, fatigue, 
gastroenteritis, oral herpes, acne, and dry skin). The proposal to maintain these terms (except for 
toothache and dry skin which were considered not relevant for labelling as an ADR) on the basis of 
biological plausibility and being causally related is endorsed by CHMP. The applicant has adequately 
justified the rational for omitting staphylococcal skin infections from Section 4.8. The applicant 
provided an overview of serious skin infections. All of the cases presented were confounded by risk 
factors that predispose towards serious infection. The increased background risk of serious skin and 
soft tissue infections in moderate to severe PSO population is also acknowledged. The CHMP agreed 
that no additional risk has been identified for bimekizumab. Further, clinically important active 
infections is included as a contraindication in Section 4.3 and a warning and precaution is also included 
to minimize the risk of serious infections in Section 4.4 along with an entry in section 4.8. Serious 
infections which includes serious skin infections is also included as an important identified risk in the 
RMP and will also be further evaluated in ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015) and as part of the 
planned Bimekizumab real world outcomes study (see RMP).  
Although the number of non-skin related hypersensitivity reports is low, hypersensitivity is biologically 
plausible and is included in the product information of all of the other 1L-17 inhibitors approved for the 
treatment  of  PSO.  Taking  into  account  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  for  an  association  between 
bimekizumab and hypersensitivity-related TEAEs; the applicant’s rationale for excluding hypersensitivity 
reactions  as  an  ADR  is  accepted.  However,  a  warning  in  SmPC  section  4.4  regarding  serious 
hypersensitivity  reactions is  included.    A  similar  warning  is included under  the  description of  selected 
events  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  highlight  that  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  including 
anaphylactic reactions are a class side effect for IL-17 inhibitors. 
TEAES in Renal and urinary disorders, Psychiatric disorders and Eye disorders SOCS were further 
reviewed by the applicant. CHMP agreed that there is insufficient information to include any of the 
TEAEs as ADRs to bimekizumab. However renal side effects, Psychiatric disorders and Eye disorders, in 
particular eyelid disorders and cataract will continue to be monitored and reviewed in the future 
PSURs. In addition, the applicant considered that conjunctivitis could potentially be a consequence of 
impaired muco-epithelial immunity to infectious agents induced by IL-17 inhibition. The proposal to 
include Conjunctivitis (listed in the SOC of Infections and infestations) as an uncommon ADR in SmPC 
section 4.8 is endorsed by CHMP. Further, upon detailed review, the applicant did not consider TEAEs 
under the HLT of Urinary tract infections as ADRs to bimekizumab. In Pool S1, TEAEs in the HLT of 
Urinary tract infections were indeed reported at a numerically higher incidence in the placebo group 
(3.6%; EAIR: 11.9/100 PY) than in the bimekizumab group (2.1%; EAIR: 6.8/100 PY). Also, based on 
the data in Pool S2, the incidence decreased over time. Therefore, it is accepted not to include Urinary 
tract infection as an ADR. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The majority (>90%) of bimekizumab-treated study participants were <65 years of age. Over the 
initial treatment period, there was an age-related increase in TEAEs overall and in cases of eczema and 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 196/220 
 
 
 
dermatitis and candida infections (oromucosal) in subjects treated with bimekizumab. This has been 
adequately reflected in SmPC – section 4.8.  
In the longer term S2 Pool, there was a trend towards overall increase in TEAES with increasing age. 
These differences were mainly driven by the HLTs Dermatitis and eczema and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue pain and discomfort and oromucosal candida infections. Increases in Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue pain and discomfort HLT could be due to a higher prevalence in the elderly 
population however higher rates of eczema and dermatitis are not necessarily readily explained by 
older age.  
Small increases in TEAEs across the age groups <65 Years to 75-84 Years were noted in Psychiatric 
disorders (3.4-5.6%), Cardiac disorders (2.1-5.6%) Infections and infestations  SOCs (63.5% -72.2%) 
and any TEAE coding to Postural hypotension, Fall, Blackout, Syncope, Dizziness, Ataxia, or Fracture 
PTs (3.4%- 11.1%). However, there were a very small number of study participants >75 years of age 
(N=18) and none above 85 years of age making it difficult to interpret comparative safety datasets 
across the difference age groups. 
Race 
Most  study  participants  treated  with  bimekizumab  were  White  >80%.  The  most  frequently  reported 
TEAEs  in  White  and  other  study  participants  were  in  the  SOCs  of  Infections  and  infestations, 
Gastrointestinal  disorders,  and  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders.  Noticeable  differences  were 
noted  in  the  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  SOC  for  the  HLT  Dermatitis  and  eczema  (≥5%) 
where the incidence was higher in the other study participants compared with White study participants. 
Weight 
The TEAE profiles in both weight subgroups (≤120kg and >120kg) were generally similar to the overall 
bimekizumab Phase 2/3 PSO study population safety profile insofar as no new safety concerns were 
identified but there was some variability in the reporting rates of TEAEs across both regimens with a 
trend towards increased TEAEs, SAEs and drug related AEs in >120KG group. There was some 
evidence of an increased overall incidence of infection TEAEs in the >120kg group treated with the 
maintenance dose of Q4W but the rates of the commonest TEAEs, oral candidiasis and Bacterial 
infection NEC were comparable to the other wt groups.  
Regarding safety, in the ≥120kg subgroup, a slightly higher incidence of any TEAEs was noted in the 
Q4W treatment group compared with the Q8W group, although incidences and exposure-adjusted 
incidence rates were comparable to what was observed in participants weighing <120kg. No pattern 
was observed in the serious and severe TEAE terms reported for either treatment regimen. Altogether, 
no safety concerns were identified that indicate that patients weighing 120 kg or more who continue 
bimekizumab Q4W are more at risk than patients weighing less than 120 kg using bimekizumab Q8W 
in the maintenance treatment phase. 
Taking into account that women, those of lower body weights, and those of non-white race accounted 
for a lower % of the study population; the applicant agreed to closely monitor safety in those patients 
in the post marketing setting i.e. in future PSURs. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
There is limited amount of data from the use of bimekizumab in pregnant women. Furthermore, there 
are no safety data regarding exposure during lactation available. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/foetal development, parturition or 
postnatal development. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Bimzelx during 
pregnancy (SmPC – section 4.6). Use in pregnant and lactating women has been added as a missing 
information in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. The safety of bimekizumab use in pregnant and 
lactating women will be monitored in observational PASS and a pregnancy outcome registry; listed as 
category 3 in the RMP.

Prior systemic therapy 
75.9% of study participants were treated with prior systemic therapy of any kind. The incidence of 
TEAEs was higher in participants with prior systemic therapy compared with those who didn’t receive 
prior systemic therapy. This was mainly driven by increased reports in Gastrointestinal and Skin and 
Subcutaneous tissue disorder SOC. It is agreed with the applicant that there were no notable 
differences across the 2 SOCs. A higher rate of TEAEs in pre-treated patients could be expected on the 
basis that these patients are likely to have more severe disease and be more medically complex.  
However, TEAEs in the Investigations SOC was lower in participants with prior systemic therapy 
(9.8%) compared with participants with no prior systemic therapy (16.2%). There were no notable 
differences across the 2 groups within any HLT under the Investigations SOC. Overall no new safety 
concerns have been identified and no additional warnings are required for the SmPC. 
Overall, the safety data base although considerable, is smaller than that presented for similar type IL-
17 inhibitors. Nevertheless, it is sufficient to support the evaluation of the safety bimekizumab in the 
proposed indications taking into consideration the known safety profile of other similar products 
authorised in the treatment of PSO. ‘Long-term safety’ is included as missing information in the RMP. 
Ongoing studies PS0014 and PS0015, listed as category 3 in the RMP, are expected to provide further 
safety data on the long term (final CSR are expected to be submitted by 31 Jan 2024 and 30 May 
2023, respectively).  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data base is sufficient to support evaluation of the safety bimekizumab in the proposed 
indication. As expected with this class of medicines, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC 
of Infections and infestations. The most frequently reported TEAEs in bimekizumab-treated study 
participants were nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, and upper respiratory tract infections. 
Furthermore, eczema and dermatitis were reported following treatment with bimekizumab particularly 
in patients over 65. This information is adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.8. A slightly higher 
incidence of oral candidiasis was reported in patients <70 kg, this is also reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
Long term safety data and exposure during pregnancy and lactation are included as missing data in the 
RMP and will be further assessed in the post-marketing setting – see RMP. Reporting rates of adverse 
events particularly those considered to be of special interest will be further monitored with routine 
pharmacovigilance, in ongoing safety studies (PS0014 and PS0015) and in the planned Bimekizumab 
real world outcomes study.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that bimekizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers bimekizumab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Bimzelx (bimekizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Bimekizumab is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients 
who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
PSO is predominantly a skin disease, which can manifest as various phenotypes of which plaque PSO is 
by far the most common form. Symptoms that are shared by all phenotypes can include itching, 
burning and soreness. Most types of PSO have a cyclic evolution, flaring for a few weeks or months, 
then subsiding for some time or even going into a period of remission. Plaque PSO has a 
disproportionate effect on quality of life when it involves certain regions such as the face, palms and 
soles, nails, or intertriginous areas. 
Individuals with PSO are at increased risk of developing other chronic and serious health diseases. 
Comorbidities in patients with psoriasis include PsA, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, 
chronic pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease, IBD, depression, suicidality, 
hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes. There is a small increased risk of certain malignancies, 
including non-melanoma skin cancers among patients with PSO which is believed to be due to 
conventional PSO treatments including methotrexate, phototherapy, and immunosuppressants, 
including cyclosporine. The burden of comorbidities increases with increasing disease severity. Some 
comorbidities including cardiovascular disease are thought to have shared inflammatory pathways, 
cellular mediators, genetic susceptibility, and common risk factors to psoriasis. 
Current biologic therapies target the inflammatory process responsible for development of the clinical 
features of psoriasis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Therapy for patients with PSO varies per the severity of disease. Limited or mild disease is often 
treated with topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues, fumarates, and 
retinoids. Patients with more severe disease are often treated with photochemotherapy, ciclosporin, 
MTX, or biologic agents. Each therapy has unique characteristics that contribute to benefits and risks of 
treatment. 
Biologics including, but not limited to, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors and interleukin 
(IL) inhibitors (e.g., IL-17 and IL-23), are available treatment options for patients with moderate to 
severe plaque PSO who are candidates for systemic therapy. The effectiveness of TNFα inhibitors in the 
treatment of PSO has been demonstrated in many Phase 3 clinical studies and has led to the approval 
of multiple TNFα inhibitors for use in patients with moderate to severe plaque PSO. Interleukin 
inhibitors approved for PSO include the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, the IL-17A inhibitors 
secukinumab and ixekizumab, the IL-17 receptor antagonist brodalumab, and the IL-23p19 inhibitors 
guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab. These products are injected subcutaneously (s.c.) or 
delivered via intravenous (iv) infusion. Key safety concerns associated with the use of these biologic 
treatments include an increased risk of developing serious infections and malignancies; however, the 
associated risks vary across the different classes of biologic treatments. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 204/220 
 
 
 
These agents provide therapeutic options for many patients with moderate to severe plaque PSO, 
allowing achievement of at least a 75% reduction on the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index 
(PASI75). However, fewer patients experience greater improvement (PASI90) or complete clearance 
(PASI100), and as PSO affects all aspects of a patient’s life, an inability to achieve clear skin also 
negatively impacts their QOL. Furthermore, not all patients respond to current therapies and loss of 
response often occurs over time, which leads to patients switching to another medication for symptom 
relief. Thus, despite the number of currently available therapies, there remains an unmet need in the 
PSO treatment landscape for therapeutic agents that can provide more meaningful improvement in the 
extent and severity of plaque PSO. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The bimekizumab PSO clinical development programme consists of 3 pivotal Phase 3 studies designed 
to provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of bimekizumab through 52 weeks (PS0009) or 56 weeks 
(PS0008 and PS0013) in adults with moderate to severe plaque PSO ≥6 months, defined as PASI ≥12, 
body surface area (BSA) affected by PSO ≥10%, and Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 
(on a 5-point scale). 
Study PS0008 – “BE SURE” 
PS0008 is a Phase 3, multicenter study consisting of a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-
group, active comparator-controlled Initial Treatment Period followed by a 40-week Maintenance 
Treatment Period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult subjects with moderate 
to severe chronic plaque PSO. The active comparator was adalimumab. 
Study PS0009 – “BE VIVID” 
Study PS0009 is a Phase 3, multicenter study consisting of a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo- and active comparator-controlled Initial Treatment Period followed by a 36-week Maintenance 
Treatment Period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque PSO. The active comparator was ustekinumab. 
Study PS0013 – “BE READY” 
PS0013 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a 
16-week Initial Treatment Period followed by a 40-week Randomized-Withdrawal Period to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adult study participants with moderate to severe chronic 
plaque PSO. 
All of the Phase 3 studies had the same co-primary efficacy endpoints, i.e. the proportion of 
participants who achieved a PASI90 response at Week 16 and the proportion of participants who 
achieved an IGA 0/1 response at Week 16. The Initial Treatment Phase for all 3 Phase 3 studies was 
16 weeks with a follow-up Maintenance Treatment Period to Week 56/52, respectively (Studies PS0008 
and PS0009) or a Randomized Withdrawal Period to Week 56 (Study PS0013). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Clinical efficacy: Individual pivotal studies 
Co Primary response at week 16 (PASI 90 and IGA0/1) 
In Study PS0008, the bimekizumab total group was superior compared with the adalimumab group 
for the co-primary endpoints of PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response rates at Week 16. The differences were 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 205/220 
 
 
 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful for both co-primary endpoints, with odds ratios versus 
adalimumab of 7.459 (p<0.001) and 4.341 (p<0.001), respectively.  
Bimekizumab total group had a higher PASI100 response rate compared with the adalimumab group at 
Week 16 (60.8% vs 23.9%, respectively; p<0.001) and Week 24 (66.8% vs 29.6%, respectively; 
p<0.001), a difference that was statistically significant and clinically meaningful at both time points. 
A higher PASI75 response rate compared with the adalimumab group was seen at Week 4 after only a 
single dose of bimekizumab (76.5% vs 31.4%, respectively; p<0.001), which was a statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful difference. 
Bimekizumab total group had a higher PASI90 response rate compared with the adalimumab group at 
Week 24 (85.6% vs 51.6%, respectively; p<0.001) and had a higher IGA 0/1 response rate compared 
with the adalimumab group at Week 24 (86.5% vs 57.9%, respectively; p<0.001). These differences 
were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. For the bimekizumab total group, the PASI90 
and IGA 0/1 response rates observed at Week 24 were sustained through Week 56 (83.7% and 
82.8%, respectively). 
Quality of life scores showed the DLQI 0 or 1 rate was higher in the bimekizumab total group 
compared with the adalimumab group from Week 1 through Week 24 (nominal p<0.001 for Week 16). 
PSD response rates in the bimekizumab total group were higher than response rates in the 
adalimumab group from Week 1 through Week 16 (nominal p=0.010, nominal p<0.001, and nominal 
p<0.001 for Week 16 comparisons for pain, itch, and scaling, respectively) and at Week 24. 
Study participants who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab at Week 24 in Study PS0008, 
achieved and maintained similar response levels across endpoints to those study participants that were 
randomized to bimekizumab from the start of the study. The PASI90 response rates for study 
participants who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W at Week 24 (55.0%) rapidly 
increased after 1 bimekizumab dose at Week 28 (78.5%). After 16 weeks of bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
treatment (ie, by Week 40), the PASI90 response rates in the adalimumab/bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
group were similar to the rates observed in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W/Q8W groups (87.2%, 89.5%, and 88.6%, respectively), and the similar response rates were 
sustained across treatment groups through Week 56 (87.2%, 88.2%, and 89.3%, respectively). In 
addition, among study participants on adalimumab treatment who failed to achieve a PASI90 response 
at Week 24, after switching to bimekizumab 320mg Q4W, 78.5% achieved a PASI90 response at Week 
40 and 83.1% achieved a PASI90 response at Week 56 (after 32 weeks of treatment with 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W). 
In Study PS0009, the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group PASI90 (Odds ratio 6.056, p-value <0.001) 
and IGA 0/1 (Odds ratio 4.809, p-value <0.001) response rates were also superior compared to the 
ustekinumab group at Week 16. 
In Study PS0009, the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group also had a higher PASI100 response rate 
compared with the ustekinumab group at Week 16 (58.6% vs 20.9%, respectively; nominal p<0.001) 
and a higher IGA 0 response rate compared with the ustekinumab group at Week 16 (58.6% vs 
22.1%, respectively; nominal p<0.001). The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group had a higher PASI75 
response rate compared with the placebo and ustekinumab groups at Week 4 after one dose of 
bimekizumab (76.9% vs 2.4% and 15.3%, respectively; p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
In Study PS0009, the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group also had higher PSD response rates based on 
pain, itch, and scaling item scores compared with the ustekinumab group at Week 16 (77.3% vs 
68.2%; nominal p=0.053; 76.6% vs 65.8%; nominal p=0.035, and 78.5% vs 59.5%; nominal 
p<0.001, respectively).

Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W treatment demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically superior 
response rates compared to placebo for the co-primary efficacy variables, PASI90 and IGA 0/1 
response at Week 16 (Initial Treatment Period) in the individual placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 
studies (PS0009, PS0013). Superiority was also demonstrated compared to active comparators 
Adalimumab and Ustekinumab. 
In Study PS0013, the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group was superior compared with the placebo 
group for the co-primary endpoint of PASI90 response rate at Week 16 (90.8% vs 1.2%, respectively). 
This difference was statistically significant and clinically meaningful, with an odds ratio of 496.318 
(p<0.001). The bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group was superior compared with the placebo group for 
the co-primary endpoint of IGA 0/1 response rate at Week 16 (92.6% vs 1.2%, respectively). This 
difference was statistically significant and clinically meaningful, with an odds ratio of 657.255 
(p<0.001). The results of the sensitivity analyses of the co-primary efficacy variables were supportive 
of the co-primary efficacy results. When PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response rates were analyzed with 
alternative missing data assumptions (MI using MCMC monotone or reference-based regression, OC, or 
LOCF), with additional analysis sets (FAS or PPS), and an additional analysis method (logistic 
regression), the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group maintained higher PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response 
rates compared with the placebo group (nominal p<0.001 for all comparisons). 
Among Week 16 PASI90 responders, the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W + Q8W group had a higher 
PASI90 response rate compared with the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/placebo group at Week 56, a 
difference that was statistically significant and clinically meaningful (88.8% vs 16.2%, respectively; 
p<0.001). When compared by individual treatment groups, a clinically meaningful difference in the 
PASI90 response rate was observed in study participants in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q4W and 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W/Q8W groups compared with study participants in bimekizumab 320mg 
Q4W/placebo group at Week 56 (86.8% and 91.0% vs 16.2%, respectively; nominal p<0.001 for both 
comparisons). The results of the sensitivity analyses of the secondary efficacy variables were 
supportive of the secondary efficacy results. When secondary efficacy variables were analyzed with 
alternative missing data assumptions (MI using MCMC monotone regression or OC), the bimekizumab 
group had higher response rates for all secondary variables compared with the placebo group (nominal 
p<0.001 for all comparisons).  
Across the spectrum of other efficacy endpoints measuring disease symptoms and severity (PASI, IGA, 
scalp IGA, BSA affected by PSO, IGAxBSA, pp-IGA, mNAPSI), study participants who remained on 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W or Q8W maintained clinically meaningful improvements from Week 16 to 
Week 56 compared with study participants who were re-randomized to withdrawal from bimekizumab. 
Loss of clinical improvements generally became evident after 12 weeks of withdrawal from 
bimekizumab treatment (ie, after Week 24). Few study participants receiving bimekizumab relapsed 
during the study. No study participants experienced a rebound (defined as when a study participant 
experienced a ≥25% increase from Initial Treatment Period Baseline in PASI score occurring within 2 
months [60 days] of stopping therapy [i.e., being re-randomized to placebo]). 
Pooled Phase 3 data 
Initial treatment response up to week 16 
Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W was superior compared with placebo for PASI90, IGA 0/1, PASI100, IGA 0, 
and DLQI response rates at Week 16 (Initial Treatment Period).  
Clinically meaningful differences in PASI90 and IGA 0/1 response rates were observed by Week 2. 
Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated higher response rates (nominal p<0.001) at Week 16 
compared with placebo for PASI100 and IGA 0 response rates. For both PASI100 and IGA 0, a 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 207/220 
 
 
 
difference in the response rate began at Week 2 and clinically meaningful difference was observed by 
Week 4. 
Bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated higher response rates compared with placebo for PASI75 
response rate at Week 4 (76.4% versus 1.8%, respectively; nominal p<0.001). A clinically meaningful 
difference in PASI75 response rate was observed by Week 2. 
Treatment with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W resulted in higher PSD response rates at Week 16 (nominal 
p<0.001) for pain, itch and scaling compared to placebo, based on the pre-specified response 
thresholds. 
A supportive sensitivity analysis for PSD response using a more stringent threshold of ≥4 in the 3 PSD 
items performed for placebo-controlled data up to Week 16 (Placebo controlled data to Week 16) 
confirmed the results of the pre-specified main analysis (Nominal p<0.001 for all comparisons). 
In Pool E1, in the bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group, the DLQI 0 or 1 rate increased rapidly through 
Week 8 and continued to increase steadily through Week 16. The DLQI 0 or 1 rate was higher in the 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group compared with the placebo group at Week 1 through Week 16; with a 
clinically meaningful difference at Week 16 (nominal p<0.001). 
In Pool E1, bimekizumab 320mg Q4W demonstrated superior response rates compared with placebo 
for the efficacy endpoint of BSA ≤1 response rate at Week 16 (76.4% versus 0.6%, respectively; 
nominal p<0.001). A clinically meaningful response in BSA affected was observed by Week 4 (25.7% 
versus 1.2% for bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and placebo, respectively; nominal p<0.001). 
Maintenance of response up to week 52 
Maintenance of response in week 16 responders treated with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W or Q8W up to 
week 52 was demonstrated in both treatment arms and no particular numerical differences in response 
rate were observed between maintenance treatment arms. Response rates at week 52 for 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W and Q8W maintenance treatment in week 16 responders were 90% (both 
dosings, PASI90), 88% and 92% (IGA 0/1), 83% and 89% (PASI100) and 83% and 89% (IGA 0), 
respectively.  
Consistent, clinically meaningful improvements were observed for all the subgroups analysed for 
PASI90, IGA 0/1, and PASI100 response rates. Overall, there were no notable differences in the key 
subgroups of baseline disease severity, age, weight or prior treatment with biologics. NAb antibody 
status had no effect on the maintenance of response in week 16 responders up to week 52. 
In about 50% of patients not having a PASI90 or IGA 0/1 response at week 16 (61 and 68, 
respectively) but further receiving bimekizumab in the maintenance treatment period, a treatment 
response was observed at week 28, regardless of whether patients received bimekizumab 320mg Q4W 
or Q8W, and this response was maintained until week 52. 
Persistence of response up to week 52 
Persistence of response was demonstrated in all three main trials and in the analysis of the E3 pool 
data, independent of the bimekizumab maintenance dose. Pool E3 study participants (n=479, 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W only) achieved a rapid response for all primary (PASI90 and IGA 0/1) and 
secondary (PASI100, IGA 0, scalp IGA 0/1) outcomes which was sustained through Week 52. Response 
rates at week 16 and 52 were 86% and 83% (PASI90), 85% and 80% (IGA 0/1), 59% and 67% 
(PASI100) and 60% and 67% (IGA 0). Scalp IGA 0/1 was >73% from week 4 on through week 52. 
For study participants treated with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W for 1 year, consistent, clinically 
meaningful improvements in PASI90, IGA 0/1, and PASI100 responses were maintained at Week 52 for 
the subgroups analysed. There were no notable differences in PASI90 or IGA 0/1 response rates in the 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 208/220 
 
 
 
key subgroups of baseline disease severity, age, or weight. Neutralizing antibody status had no impact 
on efficacy. 
The analysis of the pooled data further demonstrated that whether or not a patient had received prior 
biologic treatment did not affect treatment response, and this was confirmed when prior exposure was 
narrowed down to either anti-TNF or anti-IL17 biologic response modifiers, the latter group being 
composed of patients with secondary failure to anti-IL17 products. 
Withdrawal, relapse, re-treatment and rebound 
In study PS0013, a randomized withdrawal was implemented on week 16 responders, of which 105 
were re-randomised to placebo, 100 received bimekizumab 320mg Q8W and 106 received 
bimekizumab 320mg Q4W in the maintenance treatment period. The median time to relapse was 197 
days for the BKZ/PBO arm, while median time to relapse could not be determined for the BKZ Q4W 
and BKZ Q8W maintenance arms. At week 56, about 10% of patients had relapsed in the BKZ arms 
compared to 73% in the placebo arm. No cases of rebound occurred in study participants who were re-
randomized to placebo. Retreatment of study participants who relapsed after withdrawal of 
bimekizumab was successful: in patients receiving bimekizumab escape treatment an 88% PASI90 
response rate was observed after 12 weeks which is similar to the response rate in the initial treatment 
period. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A strong impact of body weight on drug distribution and elimination was observed in the popPK model 
in addition to a strong effect on the two PD endpoints (PASI and IGA) according to the PK/PD models.  
The applicant presented additional data in patients weighing 120 kg or more from ongoing study 
PS0015 to complement the limited patient numbers that were considered previously. In the phase 3 
clinical program, 116 patients have now been identified with a body weight of minimum 120 kg at 
baseline (in previous analysis 86).  
In the initial treatment period, the efficacy outcomes reported at week 16 for the subgroup of patients 
weighing 120 kg or more are consistent with those reported previously in this patient group. Especially 
for the more stringent endpoints PASI100 and IGA 0, there remains a significant lower response 
compared to patients that weigh less than 120 kg.  
For the maintenance treatment period, the applicant conducted post-hoc subgroup analyses (<120kg 
vs ≥120kg) for the key efficacy endpoints PASI90, IGA 0/1, PASI100, and IGA 0 for the pooled data 
across studies PS0008, PS0009, and PS0015. Study participants in the ≥120kg group (N=88 
[Q4W/Q8W=37; Q4W=51]) on the Q4W maintenance regimen showed greater improvement in 
PASI100 between Week 16 (39.2%) and Week 48 (68.6%), compared with those on the Q8W 
maintenance regimen (Week 16: 45.9% vs Week 48: 51.4%). As such, Q4W maintenance appears 
more effective at week 48 compared to Q8W maintenance therapy in patients weighing 120 kg or more 
in the most stringent endpoints, with the new data set on the expanded patient group confirming the 
previously reported outcomes. Thus, SmPC – section 4.2 highlights that for some patients with a body 
weight ≥ 120 kg who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16, 320 mg every 4 weeks after 
week 16 may further improve treatment response. 
No subjects aged ≥85 years were recruited to the pivotal studies and thus empirical clinical data for 
this age group are not available.  
Long-term treatment effect is unknown at present, ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015) are expected 
to  provide  additional  information  on  long  term  effect.  Additionally,  the  potential  for  development  of 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 209/220 
 
 
 
neutralizing antibodies following long-term treatment is also unknown as yet. It cannot be excluded that 
lower efficacy may become an issue over time if a higher number of patients became anti-drug antibody 
(ADAb) positive. This will be closely followed up in the post marketing setting as part of ongoing study 
PS0014 
Information with regards to prior biologic failure is limited. The following information has been reflected 
in SmPC – Section 5.1: ‘Efficacy in patients with primary failure to anti-IL17 has not been investigated’. 
The subgroup analyses also suggested that subjects from Western Europe had less favourable results 
than those from Central and Eastern Europe, however, it is unclear if this is a true effect or reflects 
differences in regional medical practice. This is acknowledged however it was considered that it is 
unlikely that different effect would be expected and therefore was not further pursued.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Infections were more commonly reported in bimekizumab treated patients compared to placebo. The 
rate of reporting of infections did not increase with increased duration of exposure. The vast majority 
of infections (>98%) were nonserious, mild to moderate in intensity, and did not lead to study drug 
discontinuation. This imbalance was mainly due to an increase in nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, and 
upper respiratory tract infection. The incidence rate of events was generally similar across placebo or 
active comparator groups, with the exception of oral candidiasis which was higher in bimekizumab-
treated study participants. In general, fungal infections were reported more frequently in the 
bimekizumab treated patients. Fungal infection TEAEs were observed in the 3 HLTs of Candida 
infections, Fungal infections NEC, and Tinea infections. The majority were nonserious and mild to 
moderate in severity. Rates of discontinuation were very low (7 patients in total discontinued including 
one patient who reported a SAE for oesophageal candidiasis). The incidence rate of fungal infections 
during the Maintenance Treatment Period was numerically lower for the 320mg Q8W compared to the 
Q4W dosing regimen. Fungal infections were more commonly reported in older patients and in females 
compared with males.  Serious infections were more commonly reported in Phase 3 BKZ 320mg Q4W 
compared with Phase 3 BKZ 320mg Q8W treated groups. There was no clear pattern in SAEs, which 
were reported across gastrointestinal infections (n=5), Bacterial infections NEC (n=5), Muscle and soft 
tissue infections (n=3) and, Staphylococcal infections (n=2) Upper respiratory tract infections (n=2) 
HLTs. The majority of participants continued on study drug and no further serious infections were 
reported. Although 8 of these patients did have their treatment temporarily stopped, the majority 
(n=6) had their treatment re-introduced (after TEAEs of erysipelas, cellulitis, soft tissue infection, 
sinusitis, appendicitis, and pneumonia). There was no recurrence of serious infections.  
The incidence of hypersensitivity AEs in bimekizumab treated patients was higher than with placebo, 
driven by higher rates of dermatitis and eczema. Other hypersensitivity reactions included events in 
the SOCs of Eye disorders and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and appeared to be 
linked to seasonal allergies. There was no evidence of an increase in incidence of events reported 
under the HLT of Dermatitis and eczema with time. A significant proportion were considered related to 
study medication. TEAEs other than those in the HLT of Dermatitis and eczema, were assessed as not 
drug related. There were higher rates of eczema and dermatitis with increasing age. There was only 
one TEAE of serious dermatitis atopic which occurred >1yr after starting treatment. There were three 
serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic shock, dermatitis atopic, and circulatory collapse, 
respectively). There was no clear evidence of causality with bimekizumab with any of the three cases 
reported. There were slightly increased reports of TEAEs in Dermatitis and eczema in ADA b-positive 
patients compared to ADAb-negative patients. 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 210/220 
 
 
 
Although the EAIR for any malignancy (0.8/100 participant-years) in the S2 safety update was the 
same as that in the original submission, when non-melanomic skin cancers are excluded, the EAIR for 
malignancy increases slightly. This is due to an increase in cases of colon cancer. Events related to 
colon cancer (4 events of colon cancer, 1 event of colon cancer metastatic) were the second most 
frequently reported malignancy after basal cell carcinoma. While it is agreed that these cases are 
confounded by past medical history and had a short time to onset, the clustering of these cases is a 
concern. This will be further followed-up in the post marketing setting as part of ongoing studies, 
planned PASS and future PSURs. 
Neutropenia was more commonly reported in bimekizumab patients compared to placebo. The 
incidence was lower compared to adalimumab but slightly higher than ustekinumab. In general, 
neutropenia was transient, and was not associated with an increased frequency of infections. There 
were no SAEs associated with neutropenia. One severe case resulted in discontinuation of 
bimekizumab. The incidence of markedly abnormal low neutrophil counts (<1x109/L) were similar 
between placebo (0.6%) and 320mg Q4W group (0.6%). 14 (0.8%) Grade 3 and 2 (0.1%) Grade 4 
decreases in neutrophils were reported. None of the Grade 3 or 4 neutropenias were associated with 
severe or serious infections. 8 nonserious infection TEAEs were reported. Most of the events resolved 
except 1 event of folliculitis. 
An increased prevalence of IBD among PSO patients compared with the general population is well-
established. One study participant who was treated with bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group in the 
induction period reported an IBD TEAE (colitis ulcerative). Cases of new or exacerbations of IBD have 
been reported with IL-17 inhibitors. Of note a case of gastrointestinal inflammation that was thought to 
possibly be early Crohn’s disease was reported in the S2 Safety update report. A revised warning 
regarding IBD has been included in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  IBD (Crohn’s disease and 
ulcerative colitis) will continue to be monitored as potential important risk in the safety specification of 
the RMP and will be further evaluated as part of ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015) and planned 
PASS. 
Overall, the incidence rate of TEAEs in the Phase 3 bimekizumab was higher in 320mg Q8W group 
(76.7%) compared with the Q4W group (73.9%) with slightly higher incidences of SAEs, TEAEs leading 
to discontinuation and severe TEAEs. Drug-related TEAEs were slightly higher in the 320mg Q4W 
treated group. The incidence rate of TEAEs potentially linked to the mode of action was higher in the 
Phase 3 bimekizumab 320mg Q4W group.  The incidence of TEAEs was higher in participants with prior 
systemic therapy compared with those who didn’t receive prior systemic therapy. 
Over the initial treatment period there was an age-related increase in subjects treated with BKZ Q4W 
which was attributed to higher rates of eczema and dermatitis and candida skin infections. In the 
longer term S2 Pool there was some evidence of a trend towards overall increase in TEAES with 
increasing age including increases in SAEs. These increases were mainly driven by the HLTs Dermatitis 
and eczema and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain and discomfort. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall safety data base although considerably smaller than that presented for similar type IL-17 
inhibitors is sufficient to support evaluation of the safety bimekizumab in the proposed indications 
taking into consideration the known safety profile of other similar type  products such as ixekizumab 
and secukinumab licensed for use in treatment of psoriasis. The ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015) 
are expected to provide further data on long term safety.  
For the serious identified and potential risks, serious infections, serious hypersensitivity, malignancies, 
MACE, long-term surveillance in larger and real-world patient populations is planned, to detect late 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 211/220 
 
 
 
developing ADRs, increased incidences to an already increased background rate of comorbidities and 
low-frequency adverse drug reactions.  
A single case of IBD (new onset colitis ulcerative [EAIR 0.055/100py]) was reported in the PSO clinical 
development program. A further case of possible early Crohn’s disease was reported in the Pool S2 
safety follow up period. Although there was no clear evidence of an increased risk of IBD with 
bimekizumab in the PSO development program, exacerbation or new onset of CD and UC were 
observed in bimekizumab treated patients during clinical studies in other diseases and IBD has been 
reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors. Section 4.4 and 4.8 include warnings regarding IBD. 
IBD is included as a potential risk in the safety specification. 
The overall event rate for malignancy is low. There is no clear evidence of an increased risk of 
malignancy with bimekizumab but there was a slight increase in EAIR for colon cancer in the updated 
safety analysis. Overall rates of malignancy are similar to other IL-17 –inhibitors. Malignancy will be 
followed up as a potential identified risk in the RMP and as part of ongoing studies (PS0014 and 
PS0015), planned PASS and in future PSURs. 
So far, the impact of ADAb status on safety is considered to be limited. ADA/NAb and safety data will 
be further investigated in the ongoing study PS0014. 
Some differences between studies and between BKZ Q4W and Q8W treatment groups in the incidence 
of ISRs were noted in DV002 and DV006 substudies. These are difficult to interpret due to the small 
numbers. The applicant has committed to monitoring adverse event reporting rates by device with 
particular emphasis on injection site reactions in future PSURs.  
Review of Hypersensitivity-related treatment-emergent adverse events other than Dermatitis identified   
urticaria, conjunctivitis allergic, and rhinitis allergic, the most commonly reported hypersensitivity 
TEAEs and that TEAEs’ other than those in the HLT of Dermatitis and eczema, as not drug related. In 
the Hypersensitivity SOC individual reports of angioedema, swelling face, pharyngeal oedema, lip 
swelling, laryngeal oedema which are suggestive of a more systemic type of allergic reaction were also 
identified. Hypersensitivity events other than skin-related reactions are a well described class side 
effect for IL-17 inhibitors and are included as side effects for all of the other the IL-17 inhibitors 
currently approved in the EU (secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab). Serious hypersensitivity 
reactions are included as an ‘Important potential risk’ in the RMP. The warning regarding 
hypersensitivity in section 4.4 has been updated to indicate that that there have been reports of 
hypersensitivity reactions with IL-17 inhibitors. No cases of acute or delayed anaphylactic reactions 
associated with bimekizumab treatment have been reported in the PSO development program to date. 
A general statement in section 4.4 regarding the risk of serious hypersensitivity reaction is acceptable. 
A statement has also been included in section 4.8 regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions such as 
anaphylactic reactions.  
The increased incidence of cases of eczematous eruptions in psoriasis patients has been further 
discussed. No clear mechanism of action has been identified but several hypotheses were discussed 
exploring possible mechanisms (Th1/Th2 immune response, impact on skin microbiome homeostasis, 
Potential for IL-17C or IL-22 overexpression) for the occurrence of eczematous eruptions with anti-IL-
17 treatment. The higher incidence in elderly may be associated with an age-related decline in skin 
barrier function. Development of atopic eczema in patients with a history of psoriasis is a potential 
source of diagnostic confusion. In a systematic review by Al-Jabani et al of 92 patients who developed 
eczema following treatment of psoriasis with biologic agents including IL-17 inhibitors, the implicated 
biologic was discontinued in the majority of cases. In patients treated with bimekizumab who 
developed eczema most eczema events resolved, very few events led to bimekizumab interruption or 
discontinuation, although the majority required treatment. Elderly patients are special populations at 
Bimzelx - Assessment report  
EMA/393532/2021  
Page 212/220 
 
 
 
increased risk of experiencing these product related adverse reactions. This information has been 
adequately included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The impact of bimekizumab on lipid profile (total cholesterol) has been provided for review during the 
phase 2 study only. No data has been provided for the phase 3 studies in the induction and 
maintenance periods Pro-atherogenic components of the lipid panel have only been partially evaluated. 
Data is only available for total cholesterol results from phase 2 studies. The review of interim analysis 
of PS0015 data through Week 48 did not identify any safety concerns in terms of change from baseline 
in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels 
during bimekizumab exposure. There is no evidence that that bimekizumab impacts total or LDL 
cholesterol in a clinically meaningful way. The applicant will continue to monitor these indices in Study 
PS0015.  
The clinical relevance of the trend towards elevation of BP particularly in patients with normal BP at 
baseline is unclear. The applicant has committed to monitoring elevation of BP, in particular new onset 
in normotensive patients, in ongoing studies as well as relevant cases of elevation of BP in future 
PSURs. 
There is still some uncertainty regarding renal, psychiatric and eye disorders in particular eyelid 
disorders and cataracts. These should continue to be monitored. The applicant has committed to 
reviewing these adverse events as topics of special interest in the future PSURs. 
Although the incidence of Serious Infections  is low the incidence rate for bimekizumab (EAIR 1.4/100 
subjects years)  was comparable with the rate of these events reported for  other IL-17 inhibitors used 
to treat psoriasis (ixekizumab 1.5 /100 subject years and brodalumab 1.91/100 subj-yrs) both of 
which include serious infection or in the case of brodalumab, infections, as important identified risks in 
their respective RMPs. Section 4.3 and 4.8 include similar risk minimisation measures advising on 
specific clinical actions to be taken to minimise the risk of infection. Serious infection will be further 
evaluated as part of the planned PASS study. Serious infection has been included as an important 
identified risk in the safety specification of the RMP. 
Bimekizumab has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women, and no information on the 
excretion of bimekizumab in human milk or effects on the nursing infant is available. There is currently 
insufficient clinical data available to draw conclusions about the safety of using bimekizumab during 
pregnancy. Animal studies have not shown any effects on male and female reproductive organs and on 
sperm count, motility, and morphology. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
bimekizumab during pregnancy. Use in pregnant and lactating women has been added as a missing 
information in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. The safety of bimekizumab us in pregnant and 
lactating women will be monitored in observational PASS and pregnancy outcome registry.

Pool S2C is an update to Pool S2. It includes 5.5 months of additional data.  The update primarily consists of additional 
long-term safety data from the open-label extension (OLE) study (PS0014) as of the designated clinical cut-off date 
(15  Apr  2020).  In  addition,  safety  follow-up  (SFU)  information  from  completed  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  PS0008, 
PS0009.  No  new  study  participants  were  included  in  this  Safety  Update.  A  total  of  1371  study  participants  were 
exposed to BKZ in Phase 2 and 3 studies for at least 12 months, compared with 1073 study participants in the original 
MAA submission.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The onset of response to bimekizumab treatment is rapid and the magnitude of the effects are 
considered highly clinically relevant. The absolute response rates observed for all endpoints overall are 
high, even for the most stringent endpoints PASI100 or IGA 0, and initial responses are maintained up 
to 52 weeks. The results were both statistically and clinically significant. Both physician assessed and 
patient reported outcomes favoured bimekizumab over comparators. Consistency of treatment effect 
for the primary efficacy variables across the three pivotal studies was seen. Maintenance of effect was 
demonstrated for up to 1 year. During the Maintenance Treatment Phase, the Q8W dose was 
demonstrated to be as effective as the Q4W dose in the majority of subjects. This finding provides an 
advantage to patients due to fewer required administrations to maintain control of their psoriasis. In 
the Randomized Withdrawal Phase of Study PS0013, response rates declined, which was evident after 
12 weeks after bimekizumab withdrawal.  
Several other biologics are approved at present for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, 
including several anti-IL17 molecules: ixekizumab (Taltz, anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-17A/F), secukinumab 
(Cosentyx, anti-IL17A) and brodalumab (Kyntheum, anti-IL17RA). Bimzelx is superior to adalimumab 
and ustekinumab for the investigated endpoints. 
In patients weighing 120kg or more, who did not achieve complete skin clearance at week 16, 320 mg 
every 4 weeks after week 16 may further improve treatment response. 
Each adult dose requires subcutaneous administration of two 160 mg injections as no 320 mg 
containing bimekizumab presentation is available, which is not most convenient for the patients. Other 
formulations may be developed in future. 
The most notable safety concern identified related to infections, the majority of which were upper 
respiratory and mucocutaneous candida and tinea infections. These were mainly resolvable and did not 
impact on treatment compliance. The incidence rate of serious infections in bimekizumab-treated study 
participants was low and was comparable to ustekinumab and adalimumab treated patients. No 
particular patterns of serious infection were identified. In addition, no major concerns have been 
identified of serious hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, inflammatory bowel disease, 
malignancies, major cerebro-cardiovascular events, and neutropenia. 
 Warnings are included in the SmPC regarding hypersensitivity reactions, eczema in elderly patients 
and oral candidiasis in elderly patients and patients with lower body weight. 
Further data on long term safety of bimekizumab in plaque PSO will be provided through the post-
marketing setting.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The pivotal studies have demonstrated efficacy for bimekizumab use in moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis in adults, up to one year of treatment. More frequent maintenance dosing may be required in 
some patients weighing ≥120 kg who have not achieved clear skin after 16 weeks of initial treatment. 
The most significant safety concern associated with bimekizumab treatment is infection which is 
expected for this class of product. No safety concerns have been identified in a review of malignancies, 
MACE, neutropenia, SIB, IBD, anaphylactic hypersensitivity, injection site reactions, and hepatic TEAEs 
and LFT. The safety profile is similar to other IL-17 inhibitors. There were no clinically relevant 
differences between the safety profile of the 320 mg Q4W and Q8W doses. The safety profile is 
favourable based on the current safety dataset. Serious infections, serious hypersensitivity reactions, 
MACE, malignancy and IBD will be further evaluated in a PASS (Bimekizumab real-world outcomes 
study) and as part of ongoing studies (PS0014 and PS0015). Overall, the favourable effects outweigh 
the unfavourable effects.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bimzelx in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

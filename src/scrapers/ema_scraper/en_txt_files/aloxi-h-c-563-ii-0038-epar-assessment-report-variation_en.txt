2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Palonosetron hydrochloride is a potent and selective serotonin (5 hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) receptor 
antagonist, which has a high affinity for 5-HT3 receptors in a variety of experimental models. It is 
structurally unrelated to other currently available 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Nausea and vomiting are 
triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and 
the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic 
response, thus providing a physiological explanation for the antiemetic effects of 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonists.  
Palonosetron 250 mcg solution for injection (Aloxi EU/1/04/306/001) was approved in Europe via the 
Centralised Procedure on the 22nd of March 2005 and it is indicated for the prevention of acute 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) associated with HEC and for prevention of CINV 
associated with MEC. Palonosetron 500 mcg oral soft capsules were approved as a line extension application 
on the 5th of May 2010 for the prevention of CINV associated with MEC (Aloxi EU/1/04/306/002-003).  
The claimed additional indication is as follows: 
Aloxi is indicated in paediatric patients 1 month of age and older for 
• 
the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately and highly emetogenic cancer 
chemotherapy 
In support of this application the results of two Phase 3 studies (PALO-10-20 conducted in paediatric patients 
for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and PALO-10-14 conducted in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 5/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
paediatric patients to investigate the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)) are 
provided but only an indication in CINV is being sought. 
The entire clinical development of Aloxi for paediatric use is based on four paediatric clinical trials: CINV 
trials PALO-10-20 and PALO-99-07 and PONV trials PALO-10-14 and PALO-07-29. The data and analyses for 
PALO-99-07  (CINV)  and  PALO-07-29  (PONV)  CSRs  were  assessed  and  included  into  the  SmPC  in  2010 
(Variation EMEA/H/C/000563/II/0025). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data except environmental risk assessment have been submitted in this application, which 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted to support a Type II variation for Aloxi 250 
micrograms solution for injection to include an indication for use in paediatric patients. The ERA has been 
prepared in accordance with CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1; EMA, 2006) and further guidance obtained in Questions 
and  Answers  on  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010; EMA,2011). 
The environmental risk of palonosetron was assessed as part of the initial MA application for Aloxi 250 mcg 
solution for injection (as indicated in adults), and more recently, during the line extension application for 
Aloxi 500 mcg soft capsules. In both cases, the dose of palonosetron was sufficiently low that it passed the 
Phase I screening level ERA. Therefore, this simplified ERA for palonosetron for paediatric use refers to the 
approved ERA for Aloxi 500 mcg soft capsules. The Environmental Risk Assessment for Palonosetron in Aloxi 
500 mcg soft capsules can be summarised as follows: 
Phase I assessment 
Persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity 
The  octanol/water  partition  coefficient  of  palonosetron  has  been  determined  using  the  HPLC  method  at 
neutral  pH  and  pH  11.5  and  using  test  solutions  of  Palonosetron.HCl.  This  assay  has  been  performed 
according to OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals no. 117: "Partition Coefficient (n-octanol/water), 
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Method", April 13, 2004 and European Community (EC), 
EC  no.  440/2008,  Part  A:  Methods  for  the  Determination  of  Physico-Chemical  Properties,  Guideline  A.8: 
“Partition Coefficient”, Official Journal of the European Union no. L142, May 31, 2008.

Calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) 
The predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECSURFACEWATER) has been calculated following 
the formula required by the current CHMP guidance document as follows. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 6/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where: 
DOSEai: 
Fpen: 
WASTEWinhab:  
DILUTION: 
Maximum daily dose of active ingredient consumed per inhabitant 
Percentage of market penetration 
Volume of waste water per inhabitant per day 
 Factor of dilution for wastewater into surface water 
Thus, the values chosen for parameters were  
DOSEai = 0.5mg, the maximum daily dose. 
Fpen = 0.01, the recommended default value. 
WASTEWinhab = 200 litres/inhabitant/day, the recommended default value. 
DILUTION = 10, the recommended default value. 
The justification for the values used is the following:  Although the guidance indicates that DOSEai is ‘per 
inhabitant’,  implying  adjustment  for  the  proportion  of  patients  in  the  population,  it  also  states  that  the 
highest recommended dose should be used. Adjustment of this value for population is not permitted as this 
is  already  computed  into  the  default  Fpen  value.  The  maximum  daily  oral  dose,  0.5mg  (500mcg),  is 
therefore used as the DOSEai. 
Accordingly, the  PECSURFACEWATER in the worst case scenario is:  
The worst case calculation of PECSURFACEWATER for palonosetron hydrochloride is 0.0025μg/L, and is less than 
the specified action limit of 0.01μg/L. It is therefore assumed that palonosetron does not represent a risk for 
the environment. 
On this basis it is concluded that a Phase II assessment of palonosetron hydrochloride is not required. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  nonclinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data  have  been  submitted  in  this 
application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted to support a Type II variation for Aloxi 250 
micrograms  solution  for  injection  to include  an  indication  for  use  in  paediatric  patients.  In  this  way,  the 
results  of  the  log  KOW  of  palonosetron  is  <4.5.  Therefore,  according  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the 
Environmental Risk Assessment, a persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity assessment is not required. 
On other hand, as the PECSURFACEWATER for palonosetron hydrochloride is 0.0025μg/L, i.e, it is less than 
the specified action limit of 0.01μg/L, and no other environmental concern are apparent, it is assumed that 
palonosetron is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment and a phase II environmental assessment is 
not required for this medicinal product. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of palonosetron.  
Considering the above data, palonosetron is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This application only concerns the intravenous route of administration; no bioavailability or bioequivalence 
studies are required. Two LC-MS/MS methods were used for the analytical determination of palonosetron in 
the  pharmacokinetic  studies  carried  out  in  paediatrics.  Both  methods  were  validated  and  met  standard 
criteria. 
The PK objectives of study PALO-10-20 included the evaluation of palonosetron concentration at the end of 
the 15-minute infusion (CT) in all patients, and a PK sub-study in a subset of patients who underwent PK 
sampling at multiple time points. The PK of palonosetron and its metabolite M9, administered by IV bolus 
over  30  seconds,  have  been  characterised  in  paediatric  CINV  patients  receiving  HEC  or  MEC  in  the  first 
clinical study PALO-99-07. Palonosetron plasma concentrations from PALO-10-20 were pooled with those 
from  PALO-99-07  to  provide  a  population  PK  analysis  (PALO-10-35)  across  all  paediatric  CINV  patients. 
Lastly, a population PK/PD analysis (PALO-11-20) to evaluate exposure/response with data deriving only 
from PALO-10-20 was also conducted. 
Study PALO-10-20 PK part 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 different doses of IV palonosetron in the 
prevention  of  CINV  in  paediatric  patients  receiving  MEC  or  HEC  through  120  hours  after  start  of 
chemotherapy in single and repeated chemotherapy cycles. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of IV palonosetron in paediatric patients and to evaluate the PK of IV palonosetron in 
a subset of paediatric patients receiving MEC or HEC.  
During the first study cycle, a single PK sample was obtained at TT (end of infusion) from all patients, if 
clinically feasible. In addition, a subgroup of patients was selected for a PK sub-study. Patients selected for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 9/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the PK sub-study had PK samplings at each regular visit and had 1 additional visit specific for the collection 
of PK samples. The number of PK samples for each patient depended upon the patient’s weight and the 
number and volume of blood samples. Patients weighing 7.5 kg or more were randomised to 1 of 2 different 
groups (Group A, Group  B),  for collection of PK samples at up to 8 predefined time points. For patients 
weighing  <7.5  kg,  predefined  PK  samples  were  eliminated,  with  more  samples  omitted  as  body  weight 
decreased  so  the  total  volume  of  blood  collected  did  not  exceed  3%  of  the  total  blood  volume. 
Non-compartmental methods were used to calculate the PK parameters for palonosetron. 
Results  
PK Population  
The PK population was comprised of 281 patients for whom at least one evaluable palonosetron sample was 
available:  144  patients  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group  and  137  patients  in  the  palonosetron  20 
mcg/kg group. The PK sub study population was comprised of 61 patients 32 in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg 
group and 29 patients in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group 
The  percentage  of  female  patients  contributing  samples  to  the  PK  sub-study  was  slightly  higher  in  the 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group than in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group (51.7% vs. 46.9%). Distribution 
of patients by age group was similar between treatment arms for three of the four age groups, with about 
30% of patients in the 2 to <6 years and 12 to <17 years age groups and about 10% of patients in the <2 
years age group. The proportion of patients in the 6 to <12 years age group was higher in the palonosetron 
20 mcg/kg group than in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group (27.6% vs. 18.8%). The majority of patients 
were White and not Hispanic.

The median PK profiles for the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and 20 mcg/kg doses followed the same pattern with 
the maximum palonosetron concentration corresponding to the end of infusion. A bi-exponential decrease of 
plasma  palonosetron  concentrations  with  a  short  distribution  phase  and  a  slow  elimination  phase  was 
evident. The decrease was roughly parallel for the two profiles suggesting that T½ is comparable among 
dose levels. For 12 individual PK profiles, Cmax was observed 15 to 60 minutes after the end of infusion.  
When comparing the median PK profiles by both dose levels and age ranges, no differences between the 
overall concentration versus time pattern were evident except for the youngest patients (aged <2 years) 
receiving the lowest dose level (10 mcg/kg). Because the <2 years age group included only 4 patients, and 
the absolute dose delivered in this group was very low, one can assume that the palonosetron elimination 
phase in the concentration-time profile was not shown because the plasma concentrations in this age group 
were below the lower limit of quantification. 
Overall and by age groups, the GM of nominal dose-normalised AUCs were quite close for the 10 and 20 
mcg/kg  doses  with  inter-individual  variability  ranging  from  26.7%  (AUC0-t  in  the  20  mcg  /kg  group  in 
patients aged 12 to <17 years) to 81.3% (AUC0-t in the 10 mcg /kg group in patients aged 2 to <6 years). 
Similar  results  were  observed  when  total  dose-adjusted  AUC  values  were  compared.  These  results 
demonstrate that AUC increased with increasing dose across the four age groups. Moreover, a trend toward 
increased AUC values with increasing age was observed, with statistical significance assessed by ANOVA for 
the nominal dose-normalised AUC0-∞ (p = 0.0027). 
Overall, the GM of total dose-normalised Cmax was about 1.41-fold higher in the 20 mcg/kg group. The 
opposite  trend  was  observed  for  Cmax  in  the  individual  age  groups.  A  possible  explanation  for  the 
differences in results could be the high inter-individual variability, as expressed by CV%, that was 100% or 
higher in nearly all cases. The wide distribution of palonosetron plasma concentrations at the end of infusion 
could  be  explained  by  fluctuations  in  the  rate  of  infusion,  the  real  PK  blood  sampling  time,  or  possibly 
Assessment report

Page 11/69 
 
  
  
  
 
unreported  deviations  from  the  protocol  instructions  aimed  at  avoiding  sample  contamination  during 
collections obtained immediately after dosing.  
Median Tmax values correspond as expected to the end of infusion although, as previously mentioned, some 
individual Cmax values were observed up to 1 h after the end of infusion.  
Median T½ values were around 20 to 30 h, and were generally comparable between the two dose levels with 
the  exception  of  results  obtained  for  the  youngest  patients  administered  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg.  As 
previously described, for this small group of patients, no terminal phase was observed in the PK profiles and 
thus  determination  of  corresponding  T½  is  likely  underestimated.  Nonetheless,  an  apparent  slight  trend 
towards a T½ increase with age is evident when single patient data are plotted. 
Population PK Analyses 
PALO-10-35 was a pooled population PK analysis, conducted on palonosetron plasma concentration data 
from PALO-99-07 and PALO-10-20 clinical studies. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  PK  parameters  in  the  full  range  of  paediatric  ages,  for  the  3 
palonosetron doses administered during the 2 paediatric trials performed in the CINV indication. 
Methods 
Population  PK  models  were  built  using  a  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling  technique  with  NONMEM® 
software (double precision, version VII, level 7.20), NM-TRAN version III level 1.0, and PREDPP version IV 
level  1.0  or  greater  (ICON  Development  Solutions)  and  PDx-Pop  software.  The  first  order  conditional 
estimation  (FOCE)  method  with  interaction  was  used  for  model  development.  The  potential  significant 
covariates were screened using exploratory graphical techniques within the Xpose 4 software package.  
Various covariate models were compared and assessed. A step-wise forward additional procedure was used 
to evaluate the covariates. The following criteria were used for assessing significance of covariates in each 
adding-on step:  
•  Decrease in objective function value of at least 6.64 (Δ6.64, χ2<0.01) points using FOCE or 10.83 
(Δ10.83, χ2<0.001) points using FO;  
•  Decrease in the inter-individual variability and residual error;  
•  Decrease in the standard error of the model parameter estimates;  
•  Randomness of the individual weighted residual plots (stratified by the covariate values);  
•  Correlation  between  the  observed  concentrations  versus  individual  predicted  concentrations 
(stratified by the covariate values).  
The model selection was based on both the objective function and the qualitative evaluation of all the other 
above mentioned criteria.  
After the full model was defined, the significance of each covariate was tested individually by removing one 
at a time from the full model. The least non-significant covariate was excluded from the model first and the 
elimination steps were repeated until all non-significant covariates were excluded.  
The final model with non-correlated random effects (the diagonal OMEGA matrix) was refined by testing 
correlations between random effects.  
A  visual  predictive  check  was  performed  and  the  original  data  was  compared  to  the  median  (50th 
percentile), 10th, and 90th percentiles for the pooled, simulated data and the observations outside 90% CI

were calculated. This was used to provide evidence of whether the derived model and associated parameters 
are consistent with the data.  
A proportional plus additive residual error model was used to describe the residual error and values were 
estimated to  be  25.9%  (proportional)  and  the  fixed  50  ng/L  (SD,  additive  error  that  was  approximately 
equivalent to the lowest measurable concentration of 48ng/L). The proportional error was estimated with 
good precision as the relative standard error was low (%RSE=6.38). During the base model development, it 
was noted that if the additive error parameter was estimated, it resulted in significant model instability. 
Therefore, the additive error was fixed to a value of SD=50 and this enabled improved model stability. This 
model instability may be related to the difference between the very high concentrations at the early time 
points (0.25 to 0.32 hours), where a cluster of concentrations were greater than 10-fold the median of the 
concentrations during this time period.  
Following covariate evaluation the final model (Run# 096a) was determined to include: WT on CL; WT on 
V1; WT on V2; and WT on Q.  
Results 
The final model (Model 096a) resulted in a reduction of 271 points in the OFV when compared with that of 
base model (Model 004). Inter-subject variability of the estimated PK parameters decreased by 15.7% for 
CL, by 25% for Q, and by 51.8% for V2. The final model was found to have a slightly increased IIV for V1, 
by 4%.  
The final model for palonosetron was evaluated by performing a predictive check (PPC). The PPC estimated 
5.24% of the observed concentrations fell outside the 90% PIs for palonosetron. This confirms that the final 
PK model provides a good description of the observed data.  
The palonosetron PK parameters CL, V1 and V2 increased with increasing age and were comparable across 
the dose groups. However, since palonosetron was dosed on a weight basis and since the weights across the 
age groups overlapped, weight normalised PK parameters were also determined. 
These parameters show a similar range across the different age groups and demonstrate that once patient 
body weight is taken into consideration, palonosetron clearance and volume of distribution (CL, V1, and V2) 
across the age groups are comparable. Although there is a slight decreasing trend of palonosetron CL with 
increasing  patient  age,  this  analysis  demonstrates  that  no  further  adjustment  of  dosing  beyond  dosing 
palonosetron on a body weight basis, is required for paediatric patients. 
Study PALO-10-35 PK data showed consistent pharmacokinetic results with those previously reported for 
palonosetron in adult patients: there were no significant effects of BMI, age, race, gender, ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine clearance and concurrently administered medications, including CYP2D6 
inducers  or  inhibitors,  CYP3A4  inducers  or  inhibitors,  cyclophosphamide,  dexamethasone,  cytarabine, 
doxorubicin, fluconazole, or ranitidine, on the disposition of palonosetron. These results are consistent with 
what has previously been reported for palonosetron for adult patients. 
The analysis of model independent parameters (T½, Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-∞, dose-normalized 
Cmax,  dose-normalised  AUC0-last,  and  dose-normalised  AUC0-∞)  demonstrated  that  maximum 
palonosetron  concentrations  and  exposures  increased  with  increasing  dose.  A  consistent  trend  when 
comparing AUCs across age groups was not evident, although it appears that dose-normalised AUCs may 
increase with age.  
Palonosetron half-life appeared to be independent of dose. Patient age also does not impact palonosetron 
half-life despite a slight increase with age. In general palonosetron median Cmax estimates increased with 
increasing dose for each study, despite variability likely due to the small sample size by age group.

Pharmacokinetics in children across phase III studies 
After single-dose IV administration of palonosetron (3, 10 and 20 mcg/kg), PK profiles across both studies 
(PALO-99-07  and  PALO-10-20)  were  widely  comparable  for  all  age  groups  and  dose  levels.  Peak 
concentrations were generally achieved after the IV bolus in PALO-99-07 and at the end of the infusion for 
PALO-10-20. Main PK parameters appear to be consistent between the two studies, providing an overall 
understanding of PK results across all doses and age groups. Increases in systemic exposure (AUC values) 
were clearly related to palonosetron dose across the three dose levels tested. The exposure of palonosetron 
was similar across age groups after the single dose, although a slight trend toward increased AUC values 
with age was observed in study PALO-10-20.  
A  direct  comparison  of  Cmax  between  the  two  studies  was  not  feasible  due  to  the  different  methods  of 
administration used (30-second IV bolus vs. 15-minute IV infusion). However, across the three dose levels, 
peak exposure as reported by Cmax or CT showed a relationship to palonosetron dose in the range of 3 to 
20 mcg/kg.  
Terminal elimination half-life (T½) values from the two studies appeared to be independent of the dose 
administered, ranging between 12 and 34 hours. A slight trend toward longer half-life for older patients was 
observed, consistent with half-life values of approximately 40 hours reported in adults. In both PALO-99-07 
and  PALO-10-20  studies,  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  appeared  to  increase  with  age.  These 
increases are essentially due to the fact that palonosetron dose was adjusted based on the individual body 
weight. When Vss is expressed as L/kg, there are no apparent differences across the four age groups and 
among the three dose levels evaluated. When normalised for body weight, CL ranged between 0.14 and 0.32 
L/h/kg and appeared to be independent of the dose administered. A slight trend toward reduced clearance 
values in older patients was observed, particularly at the two higher doses tested, consistent with lower CL 
values  of  approximately  0.16  L/h/kg  reported  in  adults.  In  both  studies,  no  relevant  differences  were 
observed in any of the PK parameters between genders or types of chemotherapy. 
PALO-99-07 and PALO-07-29 were reviewed previously within a type II variation. 
The CHMP conclusions on PALO-07-29 in November 2010 were as follows: 
The report on this study performed in Russia and the Ukraine, in 7 patients aged over 28 days and up to 23 
months, 96 patients between 2 years and 11 years, and 47 patients between the ages of 12 and 16 years, 
suggests no safety issue and also suggests efficacy up to 72 hours post operatively. 
The CHMP conclusions on PALO-99-07, also in November 2010, were as follows: 
This study suggests better efficacy in treatment with palonosetron 10.0 µg/kg compared to palonosetron 
3.0 µg/kg. There was also higher efficacy in open-label, than in randomised patients (2 to 17 year olds).  
Efficacy  was  not  assessed  for  delayed  onset  nausea  and  vomiting    and  comparative  efficacy  in  multiple 
cycles was not demonstrated.    
Exposure to palonosetron was generally dose proportional, for the 3.0 µg/kg and 10.0 µg/kg dose levels, 
across  all  age  groups  evaluated.  Both  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution  appear  to  increase  with 
increasing age. These increases are largely due to the expected increase in body weight among the three 
age groups. Mean terminal elimination half-life values ranged from 21-37 hours across the three age groups 
and did not change with dose or age. There was no effect of gender on clearance, volume of distribution or 
half-life.  M9  metabolite  concentrations  increased  with  increasing  dose.  There  were  no  differences  in 
exposure  observed  between  age  groups.  Exposure  to  the  metabolite  M9  was  less  than  10%  of  the 
palonosetron exposure. There was no correlation between palonosetron concentrations and ECG findings. 
The PK data along with safety and efficacy data obtained in this study indicate that, as for most paediatric 
dosing regimens, palonosetron dosing will need to be weight -based up to a maximum total dose of 0.75 mg.

At that time CHMP agreed that the following information, based on these studies be included in the SmPC, 
section 5.1 
Paediatric population  
Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV):  
The safety and efficacy of Palonosetron i.v at single doses of 3μg/kg and 10μg/kg was investigated in a 
clinical study in 72 patients in the following age groups, >28 days to 23 months (12 patients), 2 to 11 years 
(31  patients),  and  12  to  17  years  of  age  (29  patients),  receiving  highly  or  moderately  emetogenic 
chemotherapy. No safety concerns were raised at either dose level. The primary efficacy variable was the 
proportion  of  patients  with  a  complete  response  (CR,  defined  as  no  emetic  episode  and  no  rescue 
medication)  during  the  first  24  hours  after  the  start  of  chemotherapy  administration.  Efficacy  after 
palonosetron  10  μg/kg  compared  to  palonosetron  3μg/kg  was  54.1%  and  37.1%  respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic information is provided in section 5.2.  
Prevention of Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV):  
The safety and efficacy of Palonosetron i.v at single doses of 1μg/kg and 3μg/kg was compared in a clinical 
study in 150 patients in the following age groups, >28 days to 23 months (7 patients), 2 to 11 years (96 
patients), and 12 to 16 years of age (47 patients) undergoing elective surgery. No safety concerns were 
raised  in  either  treatment  group.  The  proportion  of  patients  without  emesis  during  0-72  hours 
post-operatively was similar after palonosetron 1 μg/kg or 3 μg/kg (88% vs 84%). 
And in section 5.2 
Paediatric patients  
Across all age groups, (>28 days to 23 months (11 patients), 2 to 11 years (30 patients), and 12 to 17 years 
of age (29 patients)) of CINV paediatric patients, exposure to palonosetron was generally dose proportional 
for the 3μg/kg and 10μg/kg dose levels. Both clearance and volume of distribution appear to increase with 
increasing age largely due to the expected increase in body weight among the age groups. Mean terminal 
elimination half-life values ranged from 21-37 hours and did not change with dose or age. There was no 
effect of gender on clearance, volume of distribution or half-life. Please see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nausea and vomiting are triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the 
central  nervous  system  and  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  The  5-HT3  receptor  has  been  demonstrated  to 
selectively participate in the emetic response. Palonosetron is a selective high-affinity receptor antagonist of 
the 5HT3 receptor. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
A PK/PD analysis using data from PALO-10-20 was undertaken to assess the possible relationship between 
plasma exposure parameters versus response.  
The primary objective was to correlate exposure metrics including Cmax, CT and AUCs with the complete 
response (CR) outcome.  
Methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 15/69 
 
  
  
 
 
A  logistic  regression  analysis  was  used  to  link  exposure  metrics  (Cmax,  CT,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞)  to 
response (CR in the acute, 0-24 hours post-dose, or delayed, >24-120 hours post-dose, phases.  
This analysis also explored other covariates besides exposure that may have had an effect (predictors) of 
response. These covariates included the following:  
• Patient demographics (age, weight, gender)  
• HEC or MEC treatment  
• Total palonosetron dose administered 
Results 
A total of 279 subjects from Study PALO-10-20 were available for this analysis. This dataset includes all 
patients  analysed  in  Study  PALO-10-20  as  part  of  the  PK  sub-study  analyses  and/or  of  statistics  on 
end-of-infusion palonosetron (TT) concentrations, and with available CR data.  
Displays of PK endpoints versus PD endpoints were prepared to evaluate the relationship between exposure 
and response. The box plots of complete response in the acute phase (CRA) and complete response in the 
delayed phase (CRD) versus PK parameters showing the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles and 
outliers and the scatterplots revealed the distribution of the PK parameters by clinical response (CRA and 
CRD).  From  visual  inspection,  the  PK  parameters  are  similar  between  responders  and  non-responders, 
indicating that drug response was independent of drug exposure.  
Selected palonosetron PK parameters, i.e., Cmax, CT, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf, were used as predictors for 
the response variables of CRA and CRD. The PK parameters were log-transformed as they were found, upon 
visual inspection of the plots, not to be normally distributed. In addition, selected covariates (demographic 
factors, HEC or MEC treatment, and the palonosetron total dose) were incorporated into the model to test 
their impact on the estimates of the probability of response.  
The base model started with one PK parameter (Cmax, CT,  AUC0-last or  AUC0-inf) at a time used as a 
predictor to estimate the probability of response (CRA or CRD). The models show that the slopes of the 
regression lines were very small, indicating no real change over the exposure parameters, for both CRA and 
CRD. This indicated that no correlation between the PK parameters and response was evident.  
Several covariates were tested to determine if they would have a potential further impact on the regression. 
Patient age, weight, gender, chemotherapy regimen (HEC or MEC) and palonosetron dose were evaluated. 
The  objective  function  (OFV)  of  each  of  the  full  models  was  compared  with  that  from  each  of  the 
corresponding base models. If the decrease in OFV of the full model was >15.1 (p=0.01, df=5), then the 
model was found to be statistically different from the base model.  
For the logistic regression models of Cmax, CT, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf, versus CRA, the OFV of the full 
models were slightly decreased when compared to their respective base models (PALO-11-20,). None of the 
OFV for the full models reached the statistically significant value of >15.1 for the change in the OFV (p=0.01, 
df=5),  therefore  indicating  that  none  of  the  covariates  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  models  tested. 
Therefore, for Cmax, CT, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf, versus CRA, the base model was retained as the final 
model.  
For the logistic regression models of Cmax, CT, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf, versus CRD, the OFV of the full 
models were slightly decreased when compared to their respective base models (PALO-11-20). None of the 
OFV for the full models reached the statistically significant value of >15.1 for the change in the OFV (p=0.01, 
df=5),  therefore  indicating  that  none  of  the  covariates  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  models  tested. 
Therefore, also for Cmax, CT, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf, versus CRD, the base model was retained as the final 
model. In addition, the 95% CI for the OR included 1, indicating that there is no relationship between the 
palonosetron PK parameters and response.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Single-dose  i.v.  Aloxi  pharmacokinetic  data  was  obtained  from  a  subset  of  paediatric  cancer  patients 
(n=280)  that received 10 µg/kg or 20 µg/kg. After a 15 min infusion, palonosetron PK profiles appear widely 
comparable for all age groups and both dose levels, with a peak generally reported immediately at the end 
of infusion, followed by a first rapid palonosetron concentration decrease and a much slower elimination 
phase, with a terminal elimination T½ of about 20 to 30 h. 
AUC values, as well as concentrations at the end of infusion, were clearly related to the palonosetron dose 
level. Relation of Cmax values with dose levels could not be clearly shown. For 12 individual PK profiles, 
Cmax was observed 15 to 60 minutes after the end of infusion. The high intra- and inter-subject variability 
observed could explain in part the delay in these 12 subjects. Fluctuations in the rate of infusion and in the 
sampling time could have contributed to some extent as well.  
Both, clearance and volume of distribution appear to increase with increasing age; however, no apparent 
differences in the distribution of individual patient values across the age groups and between the two dose 
levels  could  be  detected  following  normalisation  by  body  weight.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  were 
observed in any of the PK parameters reported between genders or types of chemotherapy.  
The data do not indicate that the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron is strictly dependent on patient age. 
Whereas a few slight trends were reported for some PK parameters (including T½ and CL) among age groups 
and peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion were highly variable in 
all age groups and tended to be lower in patients < 6 years ranges remained within the parameter variability 
observed and were mostly overlapping between age groups. No further adjustment of dosing, beyond dosing 
palonosetron on an individual patient weight basis, is required for paediatric patients. 
As labelled in the product information the number of children under the age of 2 is small. However, the 
efficacy data from study PALO-10-20 does not indicate a lesser effect of palonosetron in this younger patient 
subgroup and supports the proposed dose of 20mcg/kg.  
Acknowledging that different dose levels and modes of administration pose several limitations to perform a 
direct  comparison,  the  observed  PK  results  are  in  line  with  what  has  been  previously  reported  for 
palonosetron in adult patients. Useful information for the prescribing physician on comparability in terms of 
dose-normalised AUC0-∞, CL, T½ and Vss between adult cancer patients and paediatric cancer patients were 
included in section 5.2. of the SPC.  
The logistic regression analysis of CR in the acute phase and CR in the delayed phase, using measures of 
palonosetron exposure as predictors of response, indicated that no clear relationship was evident between 
drug exposure and response in paediatric patients. None of the patient factors tested, including body weight, 
age, gender, chemotherapy regimen, or total dose administered, had an impact on the response variables, 
CR in the acute phase or CR in the delayed phase. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  Pharmacology  of  palonosetron  for  the  proposed  dose  of  20mcg/kg  is  considered  to  be  sufficiently 
characterized. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy

PALO-07-29  (PONV)  and  PALO-99-07  (CINV)  were  early  trials  and  both  are  considered  pilot 
(proof-of-concept)  studies.  As  the  designated paediatric  age groups  in  these pilot  studies were  different 
from  those  subsequently  specified  by  the  FDA,  addenda  to  these  study  reports  were  prepared  and  are 
provided.  Since  the  data  and  analyses  for  PALO-99-07  (CINV)  and  PALO-07-29  (PONV)  CSRs  were 
submitted  and  assessed  by  the  EMA  in  2010,  in  this  application  only  the  above  mentioned  study  report 
addenda are included. Two larger studies PALO-10-14 (PONV) and PALO-10-20 (CINV) are provided. As the 
MAH is only seeking an indication in CINV, efficacy assessment concentrates on PALO-10-20. 
PALO-99-07 and PALO-10-20 were conducted to investigate the efficacy of palonosetron IV in the prevention 
of CINV in paediatric cancer patients. A total of 585 paediatric patients were enrolled or randomised in the 
2 Phase 3 studies of IV palonosetron for the prevention of CINV. The studies were conducted in paediatric 
cancer patients receiving MEC or HEC chemotherapy. Of the 585 patients, 577 were randomised/assigned to 
treatment and 565 were part of the evaluable population for efficacy during the first cycle (patients treated 
by  HEC/MEC  chemotherapy  and  by  study  drug).  A  total  of  403  patients  were  assigned/randomised  to 
palonosetron (35 to the 3 mcg/kg dose, 203 to the 10 mcg/kg dose, and 165 to the 20 mcg/kg dose) and 162 
were randomised to ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg 3 times every 4 hours) as standard therapy. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No specific dose finding study was performed in the paediatric population. 
The MAH indicates that the dose selection of palonosetron to be administered to paediatric patients in this 
study was based on:  
•  Clinical and PK data for palonosetron in paediatric oncology patients  
•  Clinical and PK data for palonosetron in adult oncology patients  
•  Metabolism and ontogeny considerations (including CYP 450 enzymes involved in the disposition of 
palonosetron)  
A study (PALO-99-07) in preventing CINV in paediatric patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy demonstrated that the proportion of patients with complete response was higher in patients 
treated with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg than in patients treated with palonosetron 3 mcg/kg. The PK portion of 
the  study  demonstrated  that  paediatric  patients  require  higher  weight-based (mcg/kg)  doses  than  adult 
patients due to greater clearance in children than in adults.  
The efficacy of palonosetron in preventing CINV in adult oncology patients was demonstrated by three Phase 
3 studies (PALO-99-03, PALO-99-04, and PALO-99-95) with IV palonosetron at doses of 0.25 mg and 0.75 
mg (corresponding to 3 mcg/kg and 10 mcg/kg) in patient populations receiving MEC or HEC. These studies 
demonstrated that the 0.25 mg dose was the lowest effective dose, with no significant difference in safety 
profile between the doses.  
In adults, approximately 50% of a dose of palonosetron is eliminated by hepatic metabolism, primarily by 
CYP2D6 (with minor contribution of other CYP enzymes) and 40% via renal clearance. Therefore, ontogenic 
factors were to be considered for both routes of elimination.  
It appears that renal clearance (based on glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) of palonosetron may be close to 
adult levels after 1 year of age, when normalised for body surface area.  
Literature sources suggest that hepatic metabolism of palonosetron between 1 and 5 years, primarily driven 
by CYP2D6, would be expected to be close to adult capacity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 18/69 
 
  
  
 
In addition, PK evidence from Study PALO-99-07 indicates that clearance of palonosetron in paediatric CINV 
patients (age >1 month) is higher compared to adults, but no age changes are shown when clearance is 
adjusted for weight. Therefore after one month of age, an adult dose (adjusted for weight) appeared to be 
appropriate.

PALO-10-20 
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Two 
Different Doses of Palonosetron Compared to Ondansetron in the Prevention of CINV in Pediatric Patients 
Undergoing Single and Repeated Cycles of MEC or HEC 
Methods 
Study participants  
Diagnosis  and  Main  Criteria  for  Inclusion: The target population was paediatric patients aged from 
full-term  neonates  to  <17  years  scheduled  to  receive  at  least  one  moderately  or  highly  emetogenic 
chemotherapeutic agent for histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant disease. For patients aged 
≥10 years ECOG PS ≤2 was requested.  
Main  exclusion  criteria The main exclusion criteria were patients suffering from ongoing vomiting from 
any organic aetiology (including patients with history of gastric outlet obstruction or intestinal obstruction 
due  to  adhesions  or  volvulus)  or  patients  with  hydrocephalus;  patients  who  experienced  any  vomiting, 
retching, or nausea within 24 hours prior to the administration of the study drug; patients who received any 
drug with potential antiemetic effect within 24 hours prior to administration of study treatment; patients 
who  had  received  total  body  irradiation,  upper  abdomen  radiotherapy,  radiotherapy  of  the  cranium, 
craniospinal regions or the pelvis within 1 week prior to study entry (screening) or were expected to receive 
any  of  these  treatments  less  than  24  hours  after  study  drug  administration;  patients  with  baseline 
prolongation of QTc interval (>460ms); patients with known allergies to components or contraindications to 
5-HT3 receptor antagonists; patients with active infection or uncontrolled medical condition.  
Overall,  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  similar  between  the  two  Phase  3  PALO-99-07  and 
PALO-10-20 studies and the ITT and FAS populations were similar in terms of age, gender, and ethnic origin. 
The ages of patients were well balanced across treatment groups in both studies; the mean age of patients 
in each treatment group in both studies ranged between 8 and 9 years old. The distribution of genders was 
well balanced across treatment groups in PALO-99-07 with approximately 60% enrolment of male patients 
compared with approximately 40% enrolment of female patients. There were some minor differences in 
gender between treatment groups in PALO-10-20 with the overall distribution of about 53% male and 46% 
female patients. The majority of patients in both studies were White and of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin. 
The 2 studies differed with regard to the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents received by most 
patients. In study PALO-99-07, the majority of patients in both treatment groups received HEC (68.0%) 
whereas in study PALO-10-20, the majority of patients in all 3 treatment groups received MEC (69.2%). 
Within each study, the distribution of patients by emetogenicity of the chemotherapy they received was well 
balanced across treatment groups.

Treatments 
A double-dummy design was adopted for this study i.e., each patient received two different medications: an 
active compound and a placebo for the other treatment. Study drugs were administered only to patients who 
participated in the study.  
Palonosetron/matching placebo was administered as either 10 mcg/kg up to a maximum total dose of 0.75 
mg in the lower dose group or 20 mcg/kg up to a maximum total dose of 1.50 mg in the higher dose. In the 
neonate sub-study, sequential cohorts of 3 patients each were to be given palonosetron doses of 3 mcg/kg, 
10 mcg/kg, and 20 mcg/kg, respectively, after the DMC had determined that the preceding dose was safe 
and  well  tolerated.  Open-label  palonosetron  diluted  in  isotonic  saline  was  the  only  study  drug  to  be 
administered to patients in the neonate sub-study.  
All  patients  randomized  to  ondansetron/matching  placebo  received  three  doses  of  0.15  mg/kg  up  to  a 
maximum total dose of 32 mg.  
Palonosetron was administered 30±5 minutes prior to start of chemotherapy as an IV infusion of 15 minutes.  
Study drug was administered on Day 1 for up to four study cycles. The planned duration of the study was a 
maximum of 32 days for the first study cycle, which included screening up to 14 days before randomisation 
(up  to  7  days  for  patients  aged  <2  years),  the  day  of  randomisation,  administration  of  study  drug  and 
chemotherapy (Study Day 1), and the control visits (Study Days 2 to 6). The final Visit was between Day 7 
and Day 10, and a follow up telephone contact between Day 15 and Day 18. The maximum duration of each 
of the subsequent cycles was 21 days. For patients undergoing multiple cycles the total study duration could 
be up to 16.5 weeks.  
The  active  comparator  in  study  PALO-10-20  was  selected  to  be  ondansetron  (Zofran®),  since  it  is 
considered  to  be  the  current  standard  of  care  in  the  US  for  the  prevention  of  CINV  in  paediatric  cancer 
patients. 
Medications for Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting  
Medication  for  the  prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  or  any  other  medication  with  potential  antiemetic 
properties  within  the  24  hours  prior  to  the  start of  chemotherapy  or  during  the  120  hours  after  T0  was 
prohibited. Any medication with potential antiemetic properties taken during the 120 hours after start of 
chemotherapy was considered as a rescue medication. Use of metoclopramide as rescue medication was not 
permitted.  
If a specific chemotherapy regimen also required MEC or HEC on Days 2 to 6, antiemetic therapy could be 
given on these days as per standard of care. Antiemetic treatment was prohibited until 24 hours after start 
of chemotherapy on Day 1.  
Medication for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting used in the 14 days preceding Day 1 was 
to be recorded. Systemic corticosteroid therapy at any dose within 24 hours prior to Day 1 was permitted 
only  if  part  of  the  chemotherapy  to  reduce  intracranial  pressure  or  in  case  of  topical  and  inhaled 
corticosteroids with dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone daily or its equivalent. 
Medication for Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting (Antiemetic Rescue Medication)  
Rescue medication was administered to alleviate established, refractory or persistent nausea or vomiting 
and was permitted on an as-needed basis, not as prevention or to increase the expected antiemetic effects 
of the study medication.

Rescue medication was defined as any drug taken for nausea or vomiting symptoms at any time during the 
120-hours after administration of chemotherapy. The choice of antiemetic rescue medication was at the 
discretion of the Investigator and was made available to patients whenever needed.  
Antiemetics considered as rescue medication included, but were not limited to, the following:  
5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g. ondansetron);  
•  Benzamides (alizapride);  
•  Phenothiazine  antiemetics 
(e.g.,  promethazine,  prochlorperazine, 
thiethylperazine  and 
perphenazine);  
•  Dimenhydrinate;  
•  Corticosteroids;  
•  Over the counter (OTC) antiemetics;  
•  Non-pharmacologic methods (e.g., Relief Band, P6 Acupressure).  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of intravenous (IV) 
palonosetron, compared to ondansetron, in the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
(CINV)  in  paediatric  patients  receiving  moderately  emetogenic  (MEC)  or  highly  emetogenic    (HEC) 
chemotherapy through 120 hours after start of chemotherapy in single and repeated chemotherapy cycles.  
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV palonosetron in 
paediatric patients and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of IV palonosetron in a subset of paediatric patients 
receiving MEC or HEC.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients showing CR from 0 to 24 hours (acute phase) 
after the first chemotherapy dose was administered in the first chemotherapy cycle. The efficacy evaluation 
was based on the comparison between palonosetron and ondansetron according to a non-inferiority test.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with CR from > 24 to 120 hours (delayed 
phase)  during  the  first  cycle  of  chemotherapy.  Moreover  CR  from  0  to  120  hours  (overall  period)  was 
evaluated. In addition these secondary efficacy parameters were analysed for each period (acute, delayed, 
and  overall):  proportion  of  patients  without  vomiting;  proportion  of  patients  without  emetic  episodes; 
proportion of patients without antiemetic rescue medication; proportion of patients without nausea (patients 
aged ≥ 6 years). Finally, time to first vomiting, time to first emetic episode, time to first administration of 
rescue medication and the time to treatment failure (either the time to first emetic episode or the time to 
first  administration  of  rescue  medication,  whichever  occurred  first)  were  also  analysed.  Supplementary 
exploratory sensitivity analyses were added to the analysis plan after the protocol completed in order to 
evaluate the impact on the CR of prophylactic antiemetic medication given for further administration of HEC 
or MEC on Days 2-6.  
For  Cycles  2,  3  and  4  the  following  secondary  efficacy  parameters  were  defined  for  each  period  (acute, 
delayed,  and  overall):  proportion  of  patients  showing  CR;  proportion  of  patients  without  vomiting; 
proportion of patients without emetic episodes; proportion of patients without antiemetic rescue medication 
and proportion of patients without nausea (patients aged ≥ 6 years).

The FAS including all randomised patients who have received the active study drug and highly or moderately 
emetogenic chemotherapy was the primary population for efficacy analyses. All efficacy assessments were 
summarised for the first 24 hours after T0 (time of start of administration of the most emetogenic agent on 
day 1 of each cycle) for all patients and for subgroups based on age stratification criteria. For the primary 
efficacy analysis, the CI was built on the FAS using the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method with 
correction of continuity and was compared to the non-inferiority margin. The co-primary efficacy analyses 
were based on the CI from the stratum adjusted MH method with correction of continuity computed on the 
“as-treated” population and the probability of the chi-square calculated with the stratum adjusted Miettinen 
and  Nurminen  method  on  the  FAS  and  the  “as-treated”  population.  Additional  sensitivity  analyses  were 
conducted to assess the robustness of the conclusion. Secondary efficacy analyses were performed for the 
FAS, and subgroup analyses were performed for the stratification criteria.  
Sample size 
PALO-10-20  (planned  and  analysed):  The  protocol  planned  to  enrol  492  evaluable  patients  (i.e.  164 
patients/group)  undergoing  MEC  or  HEC  in  the  double-blind  portion  of  the  study.  Eligible  patients  were 
randomised to one of three treatment groups, stratified by emetogenicity (HEC/MEC) and by age (<2 years, 
2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <17 years). The study also planned to include a small sample of 
neonates (full term [≥37 weeks gestation] infants <28 days old) in a preliminary open-label sub-study, to 
assess exposure and tolerability of palonosetron in these patients. Despite reasonable and diligent efforts, 
the Investigators were unable to enrol neonates.  
The sample size of 492 evaluable patients (164 per treatment arm) was based on the assumption of a CR 
rate in the time interval 0-24 hours of 60% in the palonosetron and ondansetron arms. For a non-inferiority 
test using a type I error equal to 0.05 (two- sided), a sample size of 164 evaluable patients per treatment 
arm  provided  a  power  of  80%  to  show  that  the  lower  bound  of  the  CI  of  the  difference  (CR0-24  hr 
palonosetron - CR0-24 hr comparator) is superior to the pre-fixed threshold of -15%. 
Randomisation 
Patients  meeting  all  inclusion  and  none  of  the  exclusion  criteria  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  three 
treatment  groups  using  the  IWRS,  which  assigned  patients  to  treatment  using  a  computer-generated 
randomisation schedule stratified by emetogenicity (HEC, MEC) and age groups (<2 years; 2 years up to <6 
years; 6 years up to <12 years; 12 years up to <17 years) through static central permuted blocks.  
The  study  was  conducted  in  a  double-blind,  double-dummy  manner  except  for  the  open-label  neonate 
sub-study. Each study kit contained either ondansetron and placebo to palonosetron, or palonosetron and 
placebo to ondansetron.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in a double-blind, double-dummy manner except for the open-label neonate 
sub-study. Each study kit contained either ondansetron and placebo to palonosetron, or palonosetron and 
placebo to ondansetron.

Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was based on the subset of patients evaluable for the 
efficacy. The Per Protocol (PP) Population included all patients in the FAS that did not have major protocol 
deviations, i.e. deviations that interfered with assessments of the primary efficacy endpoint. The Safety 
Population  (SAF) included all randomized patients receiving at least one study treatment and having at 
least one post-treatment safety assessment. For analysis, patients were assigned to study treatment groups 
according  to  the  randomised  treatment  for  the  FAS  and  PP  populations,  and  according  to  the  actual 
treatment  received  for  the  SAF  and  the  As-treated  population  (the  latter  corresponding  to  the  FAS  but 
analysed according to the actual treatment received).  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  to  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  palonosetron  compared  to 
ondansetron in terms of proportion of patients reporting CR in the time interval 0-24 hours after the start of 
chemotherapy (T0) in the first study cycle.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the CR from 24 to 120 hours (Delayed period) after T0 during the 
first cycle. The difference in CR for the Delayed period between treatment groups was analyzed using the 
Mantel-Haenszel method and the Miettinen and Nurminen method on the FAS population and the As-treated 
population at a type I error of 5% (accepted type I error for non-primary analyses) and at a type I error of 
2.5% (for informative purpose to be consistent with the primary efficacy analysis).  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety assessments were summarized descriptively for the SAF. The incidence of AEs was summarized by 
treatment, MedDRA (v. 14.0) primary System Organ Class and MedDRA Preferred Term for all TEAEs, drug 
related  TEAEs,  serious  TEAEs,  drug  related  serious  TEAEs,  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  and  drug 
related  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation.  All  TEAEs  were  summarized  by  maximum  intensity,  maximum 
severity,  and  most  conservative  degree  of  relationship  to  study  drug.  Drug  related  TEAEs  were  also 
summarized by maximum intensity.  
Haematology and blood chemistry parameters were categorised with respect to normal ranges (low, normal, 
high,  missing).  Urinalysis  parameters  were  categorised  as  negative,  positive  or  missing.  Shift  tables 
summarised changes from baseline with respect to normal ranges to the final visit of each cycle and the last 
study visit.  
Vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations were summarised descriptively for continuous and categorical 
variables.  
Efficacy and safety assessments were performed for the overall study population as well as for subgroups of 
patients based on emetogenicity (MEC, HEC), age group (<2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 12 to <17 
years), gender, race, ethnicity, and sponsor-defined geographic regions (US, Russia and Ukraine, Europe, 
Latin America).  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis:  
The following PK parameters were determined for each palonosetron dose and for each age group within 
dose: CT (concentration at the end of infusion of palonosetron), Cmax, Tmax.

Results 
Participant flow 
The percentage of randomised patients completing at least one study cycle was 98.2% for palonosetron 10 
mcg/kg, 96.4% for palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 97.6% for ondansetron. Death was the reason for study 
discontinuation  in  1  patient  in  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  and  1  in  the  ondansetron  group. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) led to discontinuation of 3 patients in the palonosetron 20 
mcg/kg group and 2 patients in the ondansetron group (1 in each group was not treated with study drug). 
The Investigators considered the relationship to study drug unlikely or not related for all AEs that led to 
premature discontinuation or had fatal outcomes. Consent was withdrawn for 1 patient in the ondansetron 
group.

Recruitment 
The study was performed at 59 sites, including 11 sites in the United States, 7 in Russia and 5 in Poland, 4 
sites each in Chile, Czech Republic, Romania and Ukraine, 3 sites each in Bulgaria, France, Hungary, and 
Peru, and 2 sites each in Argentina, Austria, and Serbia as well as 1 site in Estonia and Germany. 
Date of First Patient Enrollment: 12 September 2011 
Date of Last Patient Completed: 26 October 2012  
Conduct of the study 
Country-specific  modifications  to  the  protocol  were  implemented  at  the  request  of  Competent 
Authorities  and/or  Ethics  Committees.  As  the  SAP  was  finalised  after  the  protocol,  some  analyses  not 
originally foreseen in the protocol were added. These analyses are additional descriptive analyses by age 
group, gender, race and ethnicity. 
Many paediatric chemotherapy protocols foresee multiday chemotherapy with HEC or MEC. The protocol 
allowed such regimens and also the intake of antiemetic medications for prevention of CINV during Days 
2-6, as long as they were administered >24 hours after T0. In the analysis of CR in the Delayed phase (which 
was defined as a key secondary endpoint in this study) these patients were accounted as failures since they 
received antiemetic medication. Two additional analyses were performed, in order to study the impact of the 
study medication on CR:  
•  A sensitivity analysis was performed by creating a new endpoint (Sensitivity CR). The Sensitivity 
CR is defined as the CR except that the intake of an antiemetic medication during the 60 minutes 
before  intake  of  a  HEC/MEC  chemotherapy  was  not  accounted  as  use  of  an  antiemetic  rescue 
medication.  
•  A  further  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  on  patients  receiving  HEC/MEC  only  on  Day  1  and 
excluding all patients receiving HEC/MEC on Days 2-6.  
Protocol Deviations 
Overall, 124/502 (24.7%) randomised patients had at least one major protocol deviation and 
were  excluded  from  the  PP  population.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  major  protocol  deviations 
ranged from 23.1% in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group to 26.6% in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group, 
with  24.4%  in  the  ondansetron  group.  The  most  frequent  major  deviations  were  antiemetic 
medications  given  less  than  24  hours  before  T0  (Exclusion  criterion  #11  -  62  patients),  incorrect 
administration of study drug (39 patients) and antiemetic medication given between 0 and 24 hours after T0 
and within 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Day 2.  
Incorrect administration of study drug was mostly due to incorrect duration of infusion (<12 minutes or > 18 
minutes) or to incorrect timing of administration in respect to start of chemotherapy. All patients received 
the foreseen dose of study drug as described in the protocol.  
Minor  protocol  deviations  were  recorded  at  every  cycle  for  the  randomised  population.  A  total  of  106 
(21.1%) patients had at least one minor deviation. Minor deviations occurring for >10 patients (2% of 
the  overall  study  population)  were  incorrect  assignment  of  emetogenicity  (38  patients),  incorrect 
administration of study drug (duration of infusion or start time not correct – 29 patients), date of treatment 
different from date of randomisation (18 patients), and marked prolongation of the QTc interval at baseline 
(exclusion criterion #8 - 13 patients). The percentage of patients with minor deviations was comparable 
across treatments.

Three patients did not receive study treatment as randomised during Cycle 1 and were therefore considered 
as major deviations.  
Baseline data 
A total of 502 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment at 59 sites. Of the 494 patients 
that received study drug, 167 were included in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 165 in the palonosetron 
20  mcg/kg  group  and  162  in  the  ondansetron  group.  Study  drug  was  not  administered  to  8  (1.6%) 
randomised patients due to vomiting (4 patients: A patient was considered to have completed the study if 
he/she  completed  Visit  8  of  the  last  initiated  cycle.  A  total  of  485  patients  completed  all  initiated  study 
cycles, while 17 patients terminated the study during one of the cycles. 
Overall, at randomisation the age ranged from 64 days to 16.9 years. The FAS included 53.1% of males and 
46.9% of females. Most patients were White/not Hispanic (86.2%). Other patients were White/ Hispanic 
(8.9%),  Mixed:  White  and  native  Indian/  Hispanic  (3.9%),  Asian/  not  Hispanic  (0.4%),  Black  or  African 
American/ not Hispanic (0.4%) and Latino /Hispanic (0.2%). 
The  most  frequent  diagnoses  were  Acute  lymphocytic  leukaemia  (12.6%),  Nephroblastoma  (7.9%), 
Rhabdomyosarcoma  (7.7%),  Neuroblastoma  (6.9%),  Medulloblastoma  (6.7%),  B  precursor  type  acute 
leukaemia (6.3%) and Ewing’s sarcoma (5.1%). While the individual diagnoses were not evenly distributed 
across the three treatment groups, the combined diagnoses accounted for 50.3% to 56.9% of patients in 
each treatment group.

Overall, 78.5% of patients were non-naïve to chemotherapy (76.0% in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg 
group, 78.5% in palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 81.1% in ondansetron group). In each of the three 
groups, 51.5% to 55.1% of patients experienced nausea in previous chemotherapy, and 50.3% 
to 54.5% of patients experienced vomiting/retching in previous chemotherapy. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall, 502 patients were randomised in the study, with 169 in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 169 in 
the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 164 in the ondansetron group.  
Of the 502 randomized patients, 8 patients (2 palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 4 palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 2 
ondansetron) did not receive the study drug and, therefore, were excluded from the FAS and the SAF. One 
additional patient (623/5311; palonosetron 10 mcg/kg) received study drug but received neither HEC nor 
MEC (the patient was treated with Low Emetogenic Chemotherapy [LEC]) and was excluded from the FAS, 
but was included in the SAF (and in the PK population). Therefore, the FAS included 493 patients, and the 
SAF included 494 patients. 
One hundred and twenty-four (124) patients had major protocol deviations and were excluded from the PP 
population. The PP population consisted of 378 patients: 130 in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 124 in 
the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 124 in the ondansetron group. These patients are those from the FAS 
who did not experience any major protocol deviations.  
Patients who did not receive study treatment as randomised were included with the randomised treatment 
in the FAS and with the actual treatment for the SAF, the As-treated population and the PK population. The 
As-treated population has the same number of patients as the FAS (493 patients). The patient who received 
study  drug  but  did  not  receive  HEC  or  MEC  was  excluded  from  the  FAS,  and  thus  from  the  As-treated 
population.  
A  total  of  281  patients  were  included  in  the  PK  Population.  For  280  of  these  patients  the  plasma 
concentration value at TT was available, while 61 patients were included into the PK sub-study. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The analysis of the efficacy endpoint of CR (no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication) is 
presented  for  PALO-10-20  study  followed  by  subgroup  analyses  of  CR  by  age  group,  gender  and 
emetogenicity. Selected analyses include no vomiting, no emetic episodes, no use of rescue medication and 
no nausea (patients aged ≥ 6 years).

Complete Response (Cycle 1)  
The primary efficacy population of the pivotal phase 3 HEC/MEC study PALO-10-20 was the FAS population 
and was comprised of 493 paediatric evaluable patients. Demographics and baselines characteristics were 
representative of subjects undergoing HEC and MEC, all treatments and age groups were well balanced. The 
proportions of patients with CR in the acute, delayed and overall phases during Cycle 1 in study PALO-10-20 
are summarised below. 
In  the  acute  phase,  a  lower  number  of  patients  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group  reported  CR 
compared with the ondansetron control group (54.2% versus 58.6%) and a similar number of patients had 
CR in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group compared with ondansetron (59.4% versus 58.6%). The stratum 
adjusted MH primary efficacy analyses used to evaluate the difference in proportions of patients with CR in 
the acute, delayed and overall phases during Cycle 1 for the FAS is summarised in Table 4. 
As noted above, CR was reported for 54.2% of patients treated with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 59.4% of 
patients  treated  with  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  and  58.6%  of  patients  treated  with  ondansetron.  Similar 
results were obtained in the As-treated and PP populations, with the latter showing a numerically higher, but 
still comparable, effect of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg compared to that of the other treatment groups (see 
tables 24 and 27 on the next pages).  
The primary statistical analysis of MH (stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel test) on the FAS indicated that the 
97.5% CI of the difference in CR between palonosetron and ondansetron was of [-16.4; 7.6] and [-11.7; 
12.4] for patients treated with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and palonosetron 20 mcg/kg, respectively. The null

hypothesis (H0)  was composite, therefore two separate tests were conducted comparing these intervals 
with the non-inferiority margin of δ =-15%. As the H0 10 mcg/kg was not rejected, while H0 20 mcg/kg was 
rejected, the null hypothesis was rejected but the non-inferiority was achieved only for the dose 
of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg.

CR in the Acute Phase during the First Cycle by Age Group  
Analysis of CR rates by age group revealed different rates for the overall population among treatment arms. 
Whereas  CR  rates  in  the  ondansetron  group  remained  around  60%  in  the  four  age  groups,  rates  after 
palonosetron  administration  ranged  between  41.3%  and  74.1%,  with  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  always 
showing numerically higher CR rates compared to palonosetron 10 mcg/kg.  
Nevertheless, the 95% CIs were broadly overlapping, showing no significant differences.

CR in the Acute Phase during the First Cycle by Emetogenicity  
Patients were randomised by the Investigators to HEC or MEC at study entry according to instructions given 
in the study protocol. Nonetheless, it appeared that some Investigators assigned an incorrect emetogenicity. 
In order to standardise the emetogenicity, the sponsor re-assigned the emetogenicity group based on the 
actual chemotherapy received during Day 1.  
In  patients  receiving  HEC,  42.6%  of  patients  treated  with  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg,  51.0%  of  patients 
treated with palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 41.2% of patients treated with ondansetron showed CR in the 
Acute phase of the first cycle. These results indicated an effect of palonosetron 10 mcg/kg that was similar 
to  that  of  ondansetron  and  an  effect  of  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  that  was  numerically  higher  to  that  of 
ondansetron.  
In  patients  receiving  MEC,  59.8%  of  patients  treated  with  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg,  62.9%  of  patients 
treated with palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 66.7% of patients treated with ondansetron showed CR in the 
Acute phase of the first cycle. These results indicated that the effect of both palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg was numerically lower but comparable to that of ondansetron.

Key Secondary Endpoint: CR in the Delayed Phase during the First Cycle 
The key secondary endpoint of this study was CR in the Delayed phase (>24-120 hours after T0) of the first 
cycle,  and  was  achieved  by  28.9  %  of  patients  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group,  38.8%  in  the 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 28.4% in the ondansetron group. These results indicated an effect of 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg that was comparable to that of ondansetron. The proportion of patients with CR in 
the Delayed phase was numerically higher in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group than in the other two groups 
by approximately 10%. 
 In the age strata, the CR rate in the Delayed phase was much higher in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group 
than in the ondansetron group in patients <2 years old (40.0% vs. 13.3%, respectively) and in patients of 
12 to <17 years (40.0% vs. 16.3%, respectively). CR rate in the Delayed phase in palonosetron 20 mcg/kg 
group was slightly higher than in ondansetron group (46.3% vs. 37.0%) in the 2 to <6 years group, and 
slightly lower (28.3% vs. 36.4%) in the 6 to <12 years age group. 
For patients receiving HEC, the CR rate in the Delayed phase was notably higher in the palonosetron 20 
mcg/kg  group  (44.9%)  than  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group  (20.4%)  or  the  ondansetron  group 
(19.6%), while for patients receiving MEC, the CR rates were comparable across treatment groups, ranging 
from 32.4% to 36.2%.

Complete Response in the Overall Phase during the First Cycle  
Results in the Overall phase (0-120 hours after T0) of the first cycle were similar to those obtained in the 
Delayed  phase  with  numeric  values  of  CR  slightly  lower  than  the  ones  in  the  Delayed  phase.  CR  was 
observed  in  the  Overall  phase  (0-120  hours)  during  the  first  cycle  in  23.5%  of  patients  treated  with 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 32.7% of patients treated with palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 24.1% of patients 
treated with ondansetron. These results indicated that the treatment effect of both palonosetron 10 mcg/kg 
and  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  was  comparable  to  that  of  ondansetron,  with  numerical  superiority  of 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg in the Overall phase. With respect to emetogenicity subgroups, the CR rate in the 
Overall phase in patients receiving HEC was higher in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group (32.7%) than in the 
other two treatment groups (13.0% and 13.7%), whereas it was comparable across treatments for patients 
receiving MEC (28.6% to 32.8%). 
During Cycle 1, the proportion of patients reporting no vomiting, or no emetic episode was constantly higher 
in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group compared to the two other groups. Analysis of 95% CI for the MH (not 
Assessment report

Page 33/69 
 
  
  
 
powered, not adjusted for multiplicity) showed superiority of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg versus ondansetron in 
all phases.  
Use of antiemetic rescue medication during Cycle 1 showed numerical differences in rates but the CIs were 
overlapping and similarly MH did not show statistical differences.  
Assessment of nausea was only performed on patients aged 6 years or more. During Cycle 1, the frequency 
of  absence  of  nausea  in  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  was  consistently  numerically  higher  than 
ondansetron across all phases. This was supported for the Delayed and Overall phases by 95% CI for the MH 
(not  powered,  not  adjusted  for  multiplicity)  showing  superiority,  despite  a  reduced  population  due  to 
selection of a subset of FAS based on age.  
In line with results observed at Cycle 1, throughout study Cycles 2 to 4, and across all phases, palonosetron 
20 mcg/kg treatment group most of the time reported the highest CR  
To  establish  the  impact  of  concomitant  antiemetic  medications  during  the  0-120  hrs  period,  the  two 
secondary efficacy parameters of Emesis and Nausea were analysed in the delayed phase for the group of 
patients with or without rescue medication. 
The results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 34/69 
 
  
  
 
 
These analyses are based on the Unconditional Exact Method (non-stratified) test, as for some values the 
stratum adjusted test could not be computed due to low number of patients in strata. Nausea was assessed 
only in patients aged 6 years or more, leading to a smaller sample size. 
Comparing these results to those for the full analysis set (FAS) population reported in PALO-10-20 CSR Table 
41  and  Table  45,  it  appears  that  in  the  sub-population  of  patients  treated  with  rescue  medication  the 
outcome is in favour of palonosetron, while in the subpopulation not treated with antiemetics, comparison is 
more frequently in favour of ondansetron. As expected, results on the overall phase reported in Tables 3 and 
Table 4 below are similar to those of the delayed phase.

Time to Treatment Failure during the First Cycle  
Similarly  to  the  CR,  the  composite  endpoint  time  to  treatment  failure  is  defined  as  time  to  first  emetic 
episode or time to first administration of antiemetic rescue medication, whichever occurred first. Time to 
treatment  failure  in  the  Acute  phase  of  Cycle  1  was  summarized  by  treatment  groups,  overall,  by 
emetogenicity  and  by  age-emetogenicity  stratum  for  the  FAS.  In  the  Acute  phase  of  the  first  cycle, 
treatment failure was observed for 76 (45.8%) patients in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 67 (40.6%) 
patients in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 67 (41.4%) patients in the ondansetron group. Due to the 
low rate of events, the median time to treatment failure and third quartile could not be evaluated. 
Figure 3 shows the time to treatment failure for all patients, regardless of emetogenicity. The curves of the 
probability of treatment failure for palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and ondansetron are extremely similar, while 
the one for palonosetron 20 mcg/kg is very slightly separated after approximately 5 hours. 
Figure 4 shows the treatment failure curve in the Acute phase of Cycle 1 for HEC patients. There is a modest 
separation  between  treatment  groups  during  the  Acute  phase  with  a  small  incremental  benefit  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 36/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and a somewhat larger benefit of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg in patients receiving 
HEC, with only few points in common at the beginning of the curve and then a complete disjunction. 
There is quite no separation among treatments in the graph of CR in patients receiving MEC. In conclusion, 
for the Acute phase, Figure 5 (MEC) showed quite no separation between the treatments, while Figure 4 
(HEC) was partially in favour of a difference between treatments, indicating that the overall separation of 
treatments observed in Figure 3 (HEC and MEC) was due mostly to the incremental benefit by palonosetron 
20 mcg/kg in the HEC subgroup. 
Sensitivity Complete Response  
As described above, in order to explore the impact of multi-day chemotherapies, the Sensitivity CR was 
defined as a new endpoint. This parameter was defined as the CR except that any intake of an antiemetic 
medication within 60 minutes before intake of a HEC/MEC chemotherapy (i.e., antiemetic likely given as a 
prophylaxis) was not accounted as a use of rescue medication. This endpoint was defined only at Cycle 1 and 
only for the Delayed phase, since use of prophylactic antiemetics for chemotherapies during Day 2-6 was 
allowed by the protocol.  
The value of the crude rates and the CIs as defined by Wilson for Sensitivity CR are presented in Table 56. 
As expected Sensitivity CR rates were generally higher than those observed for the key secondary endpoint 
of CR in the Delayed phase. Comparing the Sensitivity CR and the CR, it appears that Sensitivity CR is higher 
by  6.6%,  9.1%,  and  3.1%  for  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg,  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg,  and  ondansetron 
treatment groups, respectively. These differences indicate that more patients in the palonosetron 20 and 10 
mcg/kg  groups  than  in  the  ondansetron  group  received  chemotherapy  with  antiemetic  prophylactic 
medication during the Delayed phase,  
Differences in proportions of patients with Sensitivity CR were higher for palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and even 
more so for palonosetron 20 mcg/kg versus ondansetron then they were for patients with CR. For the latter 
95% CI did not overlap.

Notes 
The  stratum-adjusted  MH  analysis  provided  a  confidence  interval  of  the 
difference  in  rates  (Delta  defined  as  palonosetron  rate  minus  ondansetron 
rate). The statistical analysis was not powered and was not adjusted to take 
into account the multiplicity of the non-primary efficacy analyses. The ranges 
of the CIs were produced for information only 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The efficacy results from the two phase 3 studies were not integrated by the MAH because of the difference 
in population sizes in the pilot study (PALO-99-07; n=72) versus the pivotal study (PALO-10-20; n=493), 
the use of different IV palonosetron doses in the pilot versus the pivotal study, and the use of an active 
comparator in the pivotal study but not in the pilot study. This in principle is considered adequate. 
In any case, results from both studies are presented by the MAH in comparative summaries. The proportion 
of patients achieving CR 0-24 h was comparable across studies for the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg dose (54.1% 
and 54.2% for PALO-99-07 and PALO-10-20, respectively); and also similar between the studies in each 
group for patients who received palonosetron 10 mcg/kg.

Among patients who received palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and MEC, the CR rates were comparable in study 
PALO-99-07 (61.5%) and study PALO-10-20 (62.5%). In the HEC setting, the CR rates were slightly higher 
in study PALO-99-07 (50.0%) compared with study PALO-10 20 (42.6%).  
Supportive studies 
PALO 10-14 
Study  PALO-10-14  was  performed  to  assess  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  intravenous  palonosetron  in  the 
prevention of PONV over 24 hour postoperative period in children from 0 up to less than 17 years. Patients 
were randomized to palonosetron 1 mcg/kg or ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg administered immediately before 
induction of general intravenous anaesthesia.  
The  main  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  showing  Complete  Response  (defined  as  no 
vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively, starting at 
T0 (when the patient woke up and was able to show any active reaction. The choice of this primary variable 
is acceptable and is the normally used for this type of products.  
As  secondary  parameters  were  evaluated  the  proportion  of  patients  with  no  vomiting,  without  emetic 
episode, without antiemetic rescue medication, without nausea (patients aged ≥6 years), the time to first 
vomiting, to first emetic episode, to first administration of rescue medication, to treatment failure.  
A total of 670 paediatric patients were randomised and 661 subjects received treatment (60.5% males and 
39.5% females): 331 patients in the palonosetron treatment group and 330 patients in the ondansetron 
treatment group. A greater number of patients of 2 to <6 years and 6 to< 12 years were included: 247 
(37.3%) and 234 (35.4%), respectively. The 12 to <17 years age group included 134 (20.3%) patients. 
Only a 7% of patients (n=46) included belong to <2 years group.  
The proportion of patients with CR was 78.2% in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron 
group. The difference between treatments was -4.4% [-10.5%; 1.7%]. As the lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the difference between both treatments was not above the non-inferiority margin (-10%), non-inferiority of 
palonosetron  compared  to  ondansetron  was  not  demonstrated.  Results  of  secondary  variables  were 
consistent with primary efficacy analysis. No main concerns of safety were raised from this study (PONV). 
The type of AEs were common in a PONV setting. 
ADDEMDUM PALO-99-07  
Study  PALO-99-07  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomised,  balanced,  double-blind,  parallel  group, 
stratified study to assess the safety and tolerability, PK, and efficacy of single IV doses of palonosetron, 3.0 
mcg/kg or 10.0 mcg/kg, in paediatric patients receiving MEC or HEC. In addition, 12 patients, aged at least 
28 days up to 23 months, were treated in an open-label fashion with the same doses of palonosetron. Data 
from study PALO-99-07 which served as proof of concept are considered only supportive.  
This  study  was  already  submitted  as  a  Follow-up  Measure  to  the  EMA  in  September  2006  (Ref. 
EMEA/467342/2006) and in September 2010 as support of a Type II variation to update Aloxi SmPC sections 
4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 (Ref. EMEA/H/C/000563/II/0025). An Addendum of this study is submitted now. 
The  objective  of  this  Addendum  was  to  re-analyze  original  PALO-99-07  efficacy,  safety  and  PK  data 
according to WR-defined pediatric age groups and other population subsets and criteria which differ from 
those designated and evaluated in the original PALO-99-07 study protocol. Safety and PK data were also 
presented by WR-defined age group, gender, and race/ethnicity. The main efficacy endpoint evaluated in the 
original Study was re-assessed in this Addendum

Main Results:  
CR  by  age:  Overall,  CR  was  higher  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  than  in  the  palonosetron  3  mcg/kg 
treatment  arm,  with  54.1%  and  37.1%  of  patients  showing  CR,  respectively.  CR  was  higher  in  the 
palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  than  in  the  palonosetron  3  mcg/kg  arm  also  in  most  of  the  age  subgroups.  A 
tendency to higher CR rates in the younger age groups was observed in both treatment arms. The following 
table summarises the Proportion of patients with CR 0-24 hours by age group - ITT 
Table 3.17: Proportion of patients with CR 0-24 hours by age group - ITT 
CR by gender. The percentage of both female and male patients with CR seemed higher in the palonosetron 
10 mcg/kg group than in the palonosetron 3 mcg/kg arm for most of the age groups. Response rates in both 
genders were similar in the palonosetron 3 mcg/kg treatment arm, but in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg arm, 
a higher response rate was found in male patients showing a CR of 63.6% as compared to female patients 
with a CR of 40.0%. 
CR by race and ethnicity. White patients had CR results that showed no particular trend in the dose-age 
comparison. Hispanic patients had similar results to those observed in White patients. 
CR by emetogenicity. Regardless of the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agent, the percentage of 
patients with CR was higher in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg arm than in the palonosetron 3 mcg/kg arm. 
Overall, higher CR rates were consistently observed in patients administered with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 
also when results were presented by gender, by race/ethnicity and by emetogenicity. Given the low number 
of patients in most of the subgroups, however, significance of the results may be questionable. 
ADDEMDUM PALO-07-29  
Study PALO07-29 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, stratified, parallel group, phase 3 study to 
assess the safety and efficacy of two doses of IV palonosetron each administered as a single dose for the 
prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting through 72 hours postoperatively in children aged >28 
days  up  to  16  year  undergoing  surgical  elective  procedures  requiring  general  endotracheal  inhalation

anesthesia. The low dose was 1 mcg/kg up to a maximum of 0.075 mg, and the high dose was 3 mcg/kg up 
to a maximum of 0.25 mg. 
It was already submitted as a FUM in January 2010 (Ref: EMA/333705/2010) and in September 2010 as 
Type II variation to update Aloxi SmPC sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 (Ref. EMEA/H/C/000563/II/0025). It has 
been  re-analysed  according  to  the  different  age  groups  proposed  by  FDA  WR,  and  it  is  provided  in  this 
application as a report addendum. 
The objective of this Addendum to the PALO-07-29 study was to describe and discuss results of Complete 
Response from 0 to 24 hours and safety data reanalyzed according to Written Request (WR) required age 
groups, gender and race/ethnicity 
Main Results 
CR by ages 
Overall,  the  proportion  of  patients  [Wilson  95%  CI]  showing  CR  was  88.0%  [78.0%-94.0%]  in  the 
palonosetron  1  mcg/kg  dose  group  and  84%  [73.3%-91.1%]  in  the  palonosetron  3mcg/kg  dose  group. 
Results were comparable between treatment arms and no clinically significant differences were observed. 
CR 0-24 hour efficacy results for the <2 year, 2 to <6 year, 6 to <12 year and 12 to <17 year WR age groups 
were  100%,  83.3%,  79.3%  and  100%,  and  100%,  87.5%,  78.8%  and  86.4%  for  the  1  mcg/kg  and  3 
mcg/kg dose groups, respectively The following table summarises the Proportion of patients with CR 0-24 
hours by age group - FAS 
All patients included in the <2 years age group were complete responders in both treatment arms. However 
only 7 patients were enrolled in this age group hence the low number of patients precluded any meaningful 
interpretation of data.

CR by race and ethnicity. All patients in the study PALO-07-29 were white, so assessment of efficacy by race 
was not feasible 
Sample sizes for each WR age group and for each gender within each age group for both dose groups were 
small to allow for definitive conclusions regarding differences in efficacy. However, in general, no clinically 
significant difference was observed within treatment group, age group or gender 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has submitted this type II variation to request a new indication for Aloxi IV:  Prevention of nausea 
and vomiting associated with moderate and highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in paediatric patients 
(1 month of age and older). 
The main data relevant to this variation are based on one pivotal Phase 3 study performed in paediatric 
patients (study PALO-10-20) to investigate the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
(CINV). The study was a multicentre, active-controlled, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, stratified 
(by  age  and  by  HEC/MEC),  non-inferiority  phase  3  trial  involving  patients  receiving  palonosetron  in  two 
different doses or ondansetron for the prevention of CINV.  
Data  from  the  study  in  PONV  (PALO-10-14)  are  considered  as  supportive  only,  as  no  indication  in 
postoperative nausea and vomiting is being sought. This study formally failed to show non-inferiority over 
standard  comparator  in  PONV.  Additionally, two  addenda  to the  CSRs  from  the  proof-of-concept  studies 
PALO-99-07 (CINV) and PALO-07-29 (PONV) are included in the dossier. The addenda are considered as 
supportive data as well. 
No formal dose-response clinical studies have been carried out in the paediatric population. Regarding CINV 
development, the selected doses to be tested in the proof-of-concept study PALO-99-07 were based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 44/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
knowledge  gained  from  the  adult  development  (PK  data  and  dose-ranging  studies).  The  results  of  the 
mentioned study supported the 10 mcg/kg dose as the lowest effective dose without safety concerns. This 
dose and a higher dose (20 mcg/kg), were chosen and tested in the pivotal study PALO-10-20 in order to 
detect a dose/exposure response relationship. The rational for dose selection seems reasonable as well as 
the proposal to test two doses, although it is noted that these doses were not supported by PK/PD modelling 
results; in any case, the suitability of one or another regimen was assessed in the pivotal study. 
Most  of  the  key  design  features  of  pivotal  study  follow  the  current  recommendations  displayed  in  the 
CPMP/EWP/4937/03  guideline  on  non-clinical  and  clinical  development  of  medicinal  products  for  the 
prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  cancer  chemotherapy.  Although  the  scope  of  this 
guideline is adult populations, it might well be also applicable to children. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients showing complete response (CR; defined as 
no vomiting, no retching, and no use of antiemetic rescue medication) from 0 to 24 hours (Acute phase) 
after T0 (start of most emetogenic chemotherapy) during first cycle in the FAS population. This endpoint is 
appropriate to assess an effect on nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron, the currently most common used 
5-HT3 receptor antagonist for the prevention of CINV in paediatric patients is considered an appropriate 
comparator. 
Secondary endpoints included as key secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients with CR from >24 to 
120 hours (Delayed phase) after T0. Additionally, CR from 0 to 120 hours (Overall period) after T0 was 
evaluated.  Other  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  to  be  determined  for  each  period  (Acute,  Delayed,  and 
Overall)  were:  Proportion  of  patients  without  vomiting;  proportion  of  patients  without  emetic  episodes; 
proportion of patients without antiemetic rescue medication; proportion of patients without nausea (patients 
aged ≥6 years); time to first vomiting; time to first emetic episode; time to first administration of antiemetic 
rescue medication and time to treatment failure was either the time to first emetic episode or the time to first 
administration of antiemetic rescue medication, whichever occurred first. These endpoints, which a priori 
facilitate  a  full  characterisation  of  antiemetic  efficacy  during  the  whole  period  at  risk  after  receiving 
chemotherapy, (usually lasts 4-7 days) are considered usual and are acceptable. 
The  posology  of  ondansetron  as  the  standard  therapy  for  acute  emesis  was  selected  in  line  with  the 
recommended dosing regimen and clinical practice in the paediatric population (3 doses of 0.1 mg/kg). The 
use of rescue medication (including Ondansetron as decided by the investigator) was permitted to control 
nausea and vomiting during the delayed period. Considering that the main objective of study PALO-10-20 
was to investigate CR in the acute phase this is considered acceptable to show non inferiority for the acute 
phase. 
The efficacy of palonosetron was evaluated during subsequent cycles as secondary end-points. Even though 
patients were not re-randomized in order to provide non-confounded data on sustained activity, such as it is 
pointed out in the CPMP/EWP/4937/03 guideline, it is acceptable hence palonosetron is not a new medicine. 
In addition, safety data from multiple cycles in children result of special interest in order to support the use 
in this population. 
For the secondary endpoints, the tests of Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and Miettinen and Nurminen (MN) were 
performed. The stratum-adjusted MH analysis provided a confidence interval of the difference in rates (Delta 
defined as palonosetron rate minus ondansetron rate), while the stratum-adjusted MN analysis provided a 
p-value for the comparison between the difference in rates and a predefined value (-15% in PALO-10-20 
study). However, -15% cannot be considered as a valid non-inferiority margin for the secondary endpoint 
analyses since it was established in the protocol only for a specific period, the Acute phase, and a specific 
parameter, the CR. For the other analyses, -15% should be seen as a subjective benchmark.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 45/69 
 
  
  
Additionally, the secondary endpoints are presented with a type I error of 5% for each arm, and without 
adjustment  for  multiplicity,  so  the  statistical  significance  of  the  test  cannot  be  seen  as  proof  of 
non-inferiority or difference between the treatment groups. 
The PALO-10-20 study was planned to control multiplicity only for the primary efficacy endpoints and not for 
the  secondary  endpoints.  As  the  study  permitted  enrolment  of  patients  treated  with  multiple  days  of 
chemotherapy,  it  is  clear  that  there  will  be  an  impact  on  the  evaluation  of  the  delayed  phase,  and  that 
evaluation of the drug effect will be confounded by other effects. 
There is no option to change the study analysis after study completion without disregarding the validity of 
the methodology but these considerations limit the statistical validity for CR over 24 to 120 hours. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 502 patients were randomized. Of the 494 patients that received the study drug, 167 were included 
in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 165 in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 162 in the ondansetron 
group.  
The treatment groups were for the most part similar. Overall, at randomisation the age ranged from 64 days 
to  16.9  years.  The  FAS  included  53.1%  of  males  and  46.9%  of  females.  Most  patients  were  White/not 
Hispanic (86.2%). Other patients were White/ Hispanic (8.9%), Mixed: White and native Indian/ Hispanic 
(3.9%), Asian/ not Hispanic (0.4%), Black or African American/ not Hispanic (0.4%) and Latino /Hispanic 
(0.2%). The most frequent diagnoses were Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (12.6%), Nephroblastoma (7.9%), 
Rhabdomyosarcoma  (7.7%),  Neuroblastoma  (6.9%),  Medulloblastoma  (6.7%),  B  precursor  type  acute 
leukaemia (6.3%) and Ewing’s sarcoma (5.1%). While the individual diagnoses were not evenly distributed 
across the three treatment groups, the combined diagnoses accounted for 50.3% to 56.9% of patients in 
each  treatment  group.  Overall,  78.5%  of  patients  were  non-naïve  to  chemotherapy  (76.0%  in  the 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 78.5% in palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 81.1% in ondansetron group). 
In each of the three groups, 51.5% to 55.1% of patients experienced nausea in previous chemotherapy, and 
50.3% to 54.5% of patients experienced vomiting/retching in previous chemotherapy. 
The majority of patients in all 3 treatment groups received MEC (69.2%). Within each study, the distribution 
of patients by emetogenicity of the chemotherapy they received was well balanced across treatment groups. 
The use of rescue antiemetic and concomitant medication had a similar distribution among 3 treatments 
groups. The distribution according to age and emetogenicity of the chemotherapy was well balanced for both 
criteria. 
CR was reported for 54.2% of patients treated with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 59.4% of patients treated with 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 58.6% of patients treated with ondansetron. Similar results were obtained in 
the As-treated and PP populations, with the latter showing a numerically higher, but still comparable, effect 
of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg compared to that of the other treatment groups.  
The primary statistical analysis of MH (stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel test) on the FAS indicated that the 
97.5% CI of the difference in CR between palonosetron and ondansetron was of [-16.4; 7.6] and [-11.7; 
12.4] for patients treated with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and palonosetron 20 mcg/kg, respectively. The null 
hypothesis (H0)  was composite, therefore two separate tests were conducted comparing these intervals 
with the non-inferiority margin of δ =-15%. As the H0 10 mcg/kg was not rejected, while H0 20 mcg/kg was 
rejected,  the  null  hypothesis  was  rejected  but  the  non-inferiority  was  achieved  only  for  the  dose  of 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg. As non-inferiority with the lower dose has not been shown use of the higher dose 
is claimed and supported by the CHMP.

The three co-primary statistical analyses (MH on the As-treated population, stratum adjusted Miettinen and 
Nurminen test on FAS and As-treated populations), and the four planned supportive sensitivity analyses 
were performed on the same endpoint with different populations and/or statistical methods, and they all 
supported conclusions similar to those of the primary efficacy analysis. Additionally, since the emetogenicity 
was revised by the sponsor at the time of blind data review meeting to ensure consistency of classification, 
a sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was also conducted using the emetogenicity as entered 
by  Investigator  at  randomization.  The  results  of  this  analysis  were  in  line  with  the  ones  of  the  primary 
efficacy analysis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, CR in the acute phase, was further analysed by age group, emetogenicity, 
gender, race/ethnicity, and geographic region and the 95% CI of the CR rates were overlapping among the 
treatment groups. In particular, highly variable CR rates were reported by age group by emetogenicity, with 
MEC patients generally reporting higher rates than HEC patients. 
A  higher  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  showed  a  complete  response  on 
delayed phase (key secondary end-point) than those in ondansetron arm (38.8% vs 28.8%); CR results in 
the  overall  phase  (0-120h)  were  similar  to  those  in  delayed  stage  (32.7%  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  vs. 
24.1%).  
Additionally the MAH performed an analysis of emetic episodes and nausea in the delayed phase for the 
group of patients with or without rescue medication. Comparing these results to those for the full analysis 
set (FAS) population, in the sub-population of patients treated with rescue medication the outcome was in 
favour  of  palonosetron,  while  in  the  subpopulation  not  treated  with  antiemetics,  comparison  was  more 
frequently in favour of ondansetron. It can be concluded that use of antiemetics in the delayed phase did 
have an effect leading to an uncertainty related to the assessment of the effect in the delayed phase. 
During Cycle 1, the proportion of patients reporting no vomiting, or no emetic episode was constantly higher 
in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group compared to the two other groups (analysis of 95% CI for the MH not 
adjusted for multiplicity). 
Use of antiemetic rescue medication during Cycle 1 showed numerical differences in rates but the CIs were 
overlapping and similarly MH did not show statistical differences.  
Assessment of nausea was only performed on patients aged 6 years or more. During Cycle 1, the frequency 
of  absence  of  nausea  in  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  was  consistently  numerically  higher  than 
ondansetron across all phases. This was supported for the Delayed and Overall phases by 95% CI for the MH 
(not powered, not adjusted for multiplicity), despite a reduced population due to selection of a subset of FAS 
based on age. 
The Kaplan-Meyer curves of time to treatment failure and time to first administration of antiemetic rescue 
medication showed similar shapes. In particular, for the Overall period these curves were S-shaped. It is 
suggested  that  use  of  antiemetic  medication  at  about  24  hours  showing  a  major  impact  on  the  time  to 
treatment failure so that the curve for time to first emetic episode in the Overall period did not show such an 
S-shaped curve.  
Differences in proportions of patients with Sensitivity CR were higher for palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and even 
more so for palonosetron 20 mcg/kg versus ondansetron then they were for patients with CR. For the latter 
95% CI did not overlap. 
For the Acute phase, the results of the CR for the PP population and for the subset of patients treated by 
HEC/MEC only on Day 1, confirm the conclusion of the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 47/69 
 
  
  
For the Delayed phase, the results of the CR for the subset of patients treated by HEC/MEC only on Day 1 
confirm the outcome of the key secondary endpoint. The additional data obtained with the Sensitivity CR are 
also in line with those results.  
In line with results observed at Cycle 1, throughout study Cycles 2 to 4, palonosetron 20 mcg/kg treatment 
group most often reported the highest CR rate, the highest proportions of patients with no vomiting, patients 
with no emetic episodes and patients with no use of antiemetic rescue medications. Overall, rates were not 
constant within the cycles, which is not surprising also in consideration of the relevant patient drop-out rate 
between consecutive cycles, approximately halving sample size at each consecutive cycle. Possibly because 
of the progressively lower number of patients, different response rates were reported across the cycles, and 
statistical significance could not be ascertained for these comparisons as indicated by overlapping 95% CIs.  
All  results  for  the  delayed  or  overall  phase  suggest  efficacy  of  palonosetron  but  considering  the  use  of 
anti-emetics  in  themselves  or  specifically  in  association  with  further  chemotherapy  after  day1,  and 
considering  that  from  a  statistical  point  of  view,  the  secondary  endpoints  were  not  powered  to  confirm 
statistical  effects,  non-inferiority  to  ondansetron  cannot  be  concluded  beyond  the  first  24  hours  after 
chemotherapy. 
The applicant provided different subgroups analyses by age, emetogenicity, gender, race, concomitant use 
of corticosteroids. Overall, although large variability is detected among treatment groups in the different sub 
analyses, response rates are generally consistent with overall population in the main efficacy analysis.  
The analysis of the primary end-point by age group and emetogenicity is worth highlighting.  
Similarly to the overall population, in the HEC strata CR rate for palonosetron 20 mcg/kg were higher than 
ondansetron in each age group. In contrast, in the MEC setting, the CR rate was higher in the ondansetron 
group than in either palonosetron groups in the 0 to <2, 6 to <12 and 12 to <17 years age strata (only in the 
2 to <6 years age stratum CR response was higher in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg than in ondansetron). 
These inhomogeneous results might be attributed to the limited sample size. 
The number of patients under 2 years included in the study was very limited (9.1% overall, 15 patients per 
treatment arm, with even smaller number when broken down by MEC/HEC). To give further assurance on 
the  youngest  patients  the  applicant  provided  results  in  the  subset  of  patients  <4  years  from  study 
PALO-10-20  indicating  that  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  and  10  mcg/kg  were  at  least  as  effective  as 
ondansetron for preventing CINV in this subset in the acute phase during the first cycle. Furthermore the 
safety  data  reported  in  the  subset  of  patients  <4  years  of  age  were  consistent  with  the  profile  of 
palonosetron in the four age groups evaluated in PALO-10-20 study. Nevertheless it is outlined in 4.2 of the 
SmPC that there is limited data on the use of Aloxi in the prevention of nausea and vomiting in children under 
2 years of age. 
Poorly controlled nausea and vomiting in previous chemotherapy cycles increases the likelihood of CINV. 
Most  patients  were  non-naïve  to  chemotherapy  (78.5%)  with  a  similar  distribution  among  the  three 
treatment groups. For the chemotherapy naïve subgroup of patients, the rates of response during the acute 
phase  were  substantially  higher  for  the  ondansetron  group  compared  to  both  palonosetron  treatment 
groups. Whereas results need to be taken cautiously given the limited number of patients in this subgroup, 
information about the percentage of non-naïve patients in the pivotal trial is considered relevant for the 
prescriber and was included in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
With regards to the submitted addendum to study PALO-10-14 the applicant doesn’t request an indication in 
PONV. The efficacy results of this study, although negative for palonosetron, along with safety data from this 
study constitute relevant information for healthcare professionals and were included in 5.1 of the the SPC.

With regards to the submitted Addendum to study PALO-99-07 containing a post-hoc analysis where the CR 
in the acute phase for subgroups of patients based on WR-specified age groups and as well as by gender, 
race/ethnicity, and emetogenicity was re-analysed the age groups for this Post-hoc analysis are the same 
defined in the pivotal study. Only data on acute response has been submitted. The response data by age 
group support those obtained in the pivotal study (in the sub-group analyses by age) with a higher rates of 
response  in  youngest  patients.  Analyses  by  subgroups  (age  and  gender)  in  the  Addendum  PALO-07-29 
display that there aren’t differences among treatment groups by age or gender, and data are consistent with 
results from the original study previously evaluated. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The data provided support the efficacy of palonosetron 20mg in the treatment of acute CINV. The primary 
efficacy endpoint, representing the proportion of patients showing complete response (CR; defined as no 
vomiting, no retching, and no use of antiemetic rescue medication) from 0 to 24 hours (Acute phase) after 
T0  (start  of  most  emetogenic  chemotherapy)  during  first  cycle  showed  significant  benefit  which  was 
considered  non  inferior  to  ondansetron.  Although  not  statistically  significant,  possibly  due  to  the 
progressively  lower  number  of  patients  and  despite  the  absence  of  re-randomisation,  the  benefit  of 
palonosetron was maintained in repeat cycles of chemotherapy. 
However, it is not possible to conclude on the effectiveness of palonosetron in the prevention of delayed 
CINV, due to the potential confounding effect of concomitant antiemetics during the study period and the 
dosing regimen used for the comparator drug. As nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy is showing multiphasic emetic time courses the indication statement will specify the use of 
Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in HEC in the acute setting. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety assessments were based on reports of adverse events (AEs), findings of routine physical examination 
(PE),  vital  signs,  electrocardiograms  (ECG),  laboratory  tests,  pregnancy  tests,  patient  diary  on  emetic 
episodes and concomitant and antiemetic rescue medication consumption, as well as unexpected outcomes. 
Monitoring for AEs was performed at each visit and during follow-up telephone contact at each cycle.  
Safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  safety  population  (SAF),  which  allocated  patients  to  treatment 
groups based on the treatment they actually received. The SAF included one patient who received study 
drug  (palonosetron  10  mcg/kg)  but  received  neither  the  highly  emetogenic  (HEC)  nor  the  moderately 
emetogenic (MEC) chemotherapeutic agents and was therefore excluded from the full analysis set (FAS) and 
the As-treated populations at Cycle 1. 
Patient exposure 
The two Integrated Safety Populations for PONV and CINV studies in the overall palonosetron programme is 
comprised of 1377 paediatric patients including 566 paediatric cancer patients and 811 surgical patients. 
Among  these  patients,  883  received  a  single  palonosetron  dose  and  494  were  treated  with 
ondansetron. Of the 883 patients who received palonosetron in the phase 3 studies, 481 (54.5 %) patients 
were treated in PONV studies and 402 (45.5%) were treated in CINV studies while for ondansetron, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 49/69 
 
  
  
 
 
330 (66.8%) patients were treated in PONV studies and 164 (33.2%) were treated in CINV studies. The 
proportion  of  patients  completing  the  studies  was  high,  with  872  of  883  (98.8%)  patients  receiving 
palonosetron and 490 of 494 (99.2%) patients receiving ondansetron. The distribution of patients by age 
group (< 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years) was generally well balanced across 
treatments in the Integrated Safety Populations for PONV and CINV indications. Overall, more male (58.0%) 
than female (42.0%) patients were treated in the PONV and CINV studies. The distribution of patients by 
gender was generally balanced across treatments with 56.7% of male patients treated with palonosetron 
and  60.3%  with  ondansetron,  compared  with  43.3%  of  female  patients  treated  with  palonosetron  and 
39.7% with ondansetron 
CINV  
A total of 577 paediatric cancer patients receiving MEC or HEC were included in the two phase 3 studies of 
IV palonosetron for the prevention of CINV. Of these patients, 566 received IV study medication with MEC or 
HEC chemotherapy. Overall, 402 patients received palonosetron (35 received 3 mcg/kg, 204 received 10 
mcg/kg, and 163 received 20 mcg/kg), and 164 patients received ondansetron in Cycle 1. Nearly all (98.4%) 
of the patients who received palonosetron or ondansetron in the phase 3 studies completed the study. Of the 
402 patients treated with a single dose of palonosetron, 6 (1.5%) patients discontinued from the study: 3 
patients (0.7%) for other reasons, 2 patients (0.5%) for AE and 1 patient (0.2%) died. Of the 164 patients 
who received ondansetron, 3 (1.8%) patients discontinued from the study because of withdrawal of consent, 
AE, and death (1 patient each, 0.6%) 
PALO-10-20 
Patients were scheduled to receive study treatment on Study Day 1 of each cycle for up to 4 cycles if they 
were to receive at least one MEC or HEC agent.  
Data are included for 494 patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication: 167 patients received 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 163 received palonosetron 20 mcg/kg, and 164 received ondansetron. It is to be 
noted that in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group, the number of patients remaining on study through the 4 
cycles was numerically higher than in the other treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
PALO-10-20 
Adverse events that occurred after signature of the informed consent and those that started before follow-up 
visit of the last cycle were recorded on the Adverse Events pages of the eCRF. For all Treatment Emergent

Adverse Events (TEAEs),  either non-serious AEs,  SAEs or Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), their severity 
(mild, moderate, or severe), intensity (CTC grade) and the Investigator’s opinion on the relationship to the 
study  treatment  were  recorded.  AEs  included  illnesses  with  onset  during  the  study  and  exacerbation  of 
previous  illnesses.  Additionally,  the  Investigator  recorded  as  AEs  any  clinically  significant  changes  in 
physical  examination  (PE)  findings  and  abnormal  objective  test  findings  (e.g.  electrocardiogram  [ECG], 
laboratory, etc.). For all AEs, the Investigator pursued and obtained information adequate to determine both 
the outcome of the AEs and whether they met the criteria for classification as SAEs. If the AE or its sequelae 
persisted, follow-up was performed until resolution or until the patient was lost to follow-up.  
Summary  of  TEAEs  by  patient  overall  (through  all  cycles),  showed  that  the  percentage  of 
patients with at least one TEAE was slightly higher in the ondansetron group (88.4%) than in 
the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg (85.6%) and palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (79.8%) groups (Table 83 on 
the next page). The percent of patients with at least one TEAE was comparable between palonosetron 10 
mcg/kg  group  and  ondansetron  group,  and  lower  in  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg.  Only  for  27  of  these 
patients, TEAEs were judged as drug-related: for 9 patients (5.4%) in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group, 
for 8 patients (4.9%) in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group and for 10 patients (6.1%) in the ondansetron 
group.  
Distribution of patients with SAEs was also similar between treatment groups with 68 patients (40.7%) in 
the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group,  62  patients  (38.0%)  in  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  and  70 
patients (42.7%) in the ondansetron group. Only for one of these patients two SAEs were judged as possibly 
drug-related.  
The majority of AEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity. Overall TEAEs of severe intensity were 
reported  for  52  (31.1%)  patients  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group,  46  (28.2%)  patients  in  the 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group, and 53 (32.3%) of patients in the ondansetron group. 
TEAEs  with  TEAEs  with  CTC  grade  ≥3  were  reported  for  111  (66.5%),  108  (66.3%),  and  124  (75.6%) 
patients in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, palonosetron 20 mcg/kg, and ondansetron groups, respectively. 
However,  only  5  TEAEs  (1  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg,  3  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg,  1  ondansetron])  in  this 
category were considered to be drug related. No patient died in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, while 
AEs with fatal outcome occurred in 3 (1.8%) patients in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and in 3 (1.8%) 
patients in the ondansetron group. One additional patient in the ondansetron group died after the reporting 
period. All deaths were considered to be unrelated to study drug.  
Three patients (2 in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 1 in the ondansetron group) experienced TEAEs 
that led to withdrawal from the study. All of these TEAEs were considered to be serious but unrelated to 
study drug.

TEAEs in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders were represented by 105 (62.9%), 101 
(62.0%),  and  111  (67.7%)  patients  treated  with  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg,  palonosetron  20 
mcg/kg  and  ondansetron,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  PTs  were  Anaemia, 
Thrombocytopenia,  Leukopenia  and  Neutropenia,  all  representing  expected  events  after 
chemotherapy. All of these PTs were reported for ≥20% of patients in at least one treatment group and all 
represent  PTs  typically  observed  in  cancer  patients,  being  expected  cytotoxic  effects  of  chemotherapy. 
Moreover, those events were all assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to the study drug. In general, the 
AEs noted for Blood and lymphatic disorders were balanced across treatment groups, with few exceptions for 
Leukopenia, Pancytopenia and Lymphopenia occurring at a lower frequency in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg, 
while the percent of patients with Neutropenia and Febrile neutropenia was lower in the ondansetron group.  
Regarding the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders, the most frequently reported PTs were Vomiting, 
Abdominal pain, Stomatitis and Diarrhoea, all reported for <15% in each treatment group. In the 
SOC  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  the  most  frequently  reported  PT  was  Pyrexia, 
reported by 34 (20.4%), 22 (13.5%), and 25 (15.2%) of patients treated with palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and ondansetron, respectively.  
No clinically significant differences were observed between the three treatment groups.

Looking  at  TEAEs  in  each  cycle,  the  most  frequently  reported  PTs  were  Anaemia,  Thrombocytopenia, 
Leukopenia,  Neutropenia,  Febrile  neutropenia,  and  Pyrexia.  All  of  these  PTs  were  reported  for  ≥20%  of 
patients in at least one treatment group. In general, the percentage of patients experiencing these TEAEs 
was comparable across treatment groups overall and within each cycle. 
Progression into subsequent cycles did not appear to induce worsening of TEAEs in any SOC, and rather a 
slight trend toward reduction in the incidence of TEAEs during progression through cycles was noted. 
To assess adverse events per age group, patients were stratified in four groups of <2 years, 2 to <6 years, 
6 to <12 years, and 12 to <17 years. Except in the youngest age group where only 15 patients were treated 
in each treatment group, in the other strata the patients were distributed almost equally, with a minimum of 
45 to a maximum of 55 patients in each stratum, the percentages of patients with at least one TEAE were 
similar across treatments within age strata and across age strata within treatment. Only a slightly higher 
frequency (not statistically significant) of TEAEs was observed in the ondansetron treatment arm, compared 
to that of each palonosetron treatment for all age groups, except in the 2 to <6 years age stratum, where the 
frequency was comparable across treatment groups.  
The percentage of patients with TEAEs of severe intensity or CTC grade ≥3 did not appear to be influenced 
by age either.  
In  general,  it  was  observed  that  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  and 
General disorders and administration site conditions were the MedDRA SOC with the most frequent TEAEs in 
all age groups.  
The  very  low  incidence  and  absolute  numbers  of  related  TEAEs  did  not  permit  the  identification  of  any 
differential trends between HEC- and MEC-treated patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015

The overall number of TEAEs by gender was comparable between male and female patients, although there 
were some particularities, differences highlighted are considered of unlikely clinical relevance, particularly 
for  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group,  since  opposite  or  no  differences  could  be  observed  in  the  same 
categories for the higher palonosetron 20 mcg/kg dose group. 
Due to the small number of patients in race categories other than white, a clear assessment of the effect of 
race on the AE profile was not possible. In each ethnicity category, the percentages were comparable across 
treatment, with palonosetron 20 mcg/kg showing slightly lower percentages. Enrolment of non-White or 
Hispanic patients was low and there was therefore a limited assessment of any potential impact of these 
demographic characteristics. 
The vast majority of patients had only TEAEs evaluated as not related. TEAEs considered to be drug related 
were  reported  for  9  (5.4%)  patients  in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group,  8  (4.9%)  patients  in  the 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group, and 10 (6.1%) patients in the ondansetron group. In the whole study, there 
was only one patient in the ondansetron arm who reported a TEAE with definite relationship to the study 
drug. The incidence of related TEAEs was very low across the three treatment groups, and no clear difference 
could be identified in any of the SOC/PTs, either between palonosetron and ondansetron arms, or between 
the two palonosetron dose levels. Overall, the  number of patients with related TEAEs in each treatment 
group was similar. 
Injection site reactions related to the study drug were reported in 2 patients, for a total of 3 related TEAEs 
(all non-serious). Infusion site reaction and Infusion site erythema were reported for 1 (0.6%) 5 year-old 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 55/69 
 
  
  
 
female patient [] in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group who received MEC. The onset of Infusion site reaction 
was on the day of treatment of the first cycle, while the onset of Infusion site erythema was on the day of 
treatment of the second cycle. Both TEAEs resolved within one day. Both TEAEs were considered by the 
Investigator to be of mild intensity and possibly related to study drug. Neither TEAE was an SAE.  
Infusion site pain was reported for 1 (0.6%) 3 year-old male patient [] in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group. 
Overall TEAEs of severe intensity were reported for 52 (31.1%) patients in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg 
group,  46  (28.2%)  patients  in  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group,  and  53  (32.3%)  of  patients  in  the 
ondansetron group The vast majority of patients with TEAEs of severe intensity was reported during Cycle 1, 
with 41 (24.6%) patients in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 34 (20.9%) patients in the palonosetron 20 
mcg/kg group, and 41 (25.0%) of patients in the ondansetron group. There was a gradual reduction in the 
number of patients with severe events from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4, largely corresponding to the overall decrease 
of patients enrolled in subsequent cycles. Indeed, a small decrease in percentage values could be observed 
across  cycles.  A  trend  of  reduced  number  of  severe  events  for  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  in 
comparison to the other two arms can be observed for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 that also enrolled a higher number 
of patients. 
CINV 
In the integrated CINV safety population for palonosetron all doses (N=402) a lower proportion of patients 
receiving palonosetron (77.4%) than ondansetron (81.7%) had at least 1 TEAE. In the palonosetron dose 
groups, there was no apparent dose-effect on the frequency of TEAEs, with the lowest proportion of patients 
with at least 1 TEAE reported in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group (69.3%) compared with the palonosetron 
10 mcg/kg (83.3%) and 3 mcg/kg groups (80.0%).  
The incidences of TEAEs (including severe, leading to withdrawal, serious, and fatal) were comparable or 
lower in patients receiving palonosetron compared with those receiving ondansetron. There was no apparent 
effect of palonosetron dose, with the lowest proportions of patients with serious TEAEs and severe TEAEs 
reported in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group compared with the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and 3 mcg/kg 
groups.  
None of the serious or severe TEAEs were assessed by the Investigators as related to study drug during 
Cycle  1.  Similarly,  among  the  3  patients  withdrawn  from  the  studies because  of  TEAEs,  no  events  were 
assessed as drug related. Overall, 1 (0.6%) patient in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 2 (1.2%) 
patients in the ondansetron group died during Cycle 1 of the study PALO-10-20 and one patient died after 
the follow-up period. No death was reported in study PALO-99-07. The Investigators considered all AEs that 
led to fatal outcomes to be unrelated or unlikely related to study drug.  
The proportion of patients reported with at least 1 TEAE was similar across all age groups for both study 
medications. With the exception of patients aged 2 to < 6 years, the incidence of TEAEs was lower in patients 
receiving palonosetron compared with those receiving ondansetron. In children aged 2 to < 6 years, 391 
events were reported in 98 (83.8%) patients who received palonosetron compared with 154 events in 41 
(74.5%) patients who received ondansetron. There was no apparent effect of palonosetron dose in any age 
group in patients who were reported with at least 1 TEAE.  
The incidence of TEAEs reported as drug-related was very low in the palonosetron group with 23 events in 
17  (4.2%)  patients  and  9  events  in  7  (4.3%)  patients  in  the  ondansetron  group  and  precluded  any 
meaningful  comparison  of  drug-related  events  across  age  groups.  Headache  was  the  most  commonly 
reported drug-related TEAE overall, with 5 events reported in 4 patients (1.0%) in the palonosetron group 
and 2 events reported in 2 patients (1.2%) in the ondansetron group. There does not appear to be any 
dose-relationship; however, the low number of patients with drug-related TEAEs in each palonosetron dose 
group precludes any meaningful interpretation of the data by palonosetron dose. Moreover the incidence of 
Assessment report

drug-related  TEAEs  was  not  notably  different  in  the  three  palonosetron  dose  groups.    Although  small 
differences were observed across age groups and between treatments, no consistent trends were identified. 
There  were  no  drug-related  events  reported  in  patients  aged  <  2  years.  The  incidences  of  drug-related 
TEAEs were higher in patients aged 2 to < 6 years and 6 to < 12 years in the palonosetron group (6.0% and 
7.1%, respectively) compared with the ondansetron group (1.8% and 4.4%, respectively). The incidence of 
drug-related TEAEs in patients aged 12 to < 18 years was higher in the ondansetron group (8.2%) compared 
with the palonosetron group (1.5%). The small differences observed between age groups are not likely to be 
of  clinical  significance.  More  female  (4.7%)  than  male  (3.8%)  patients  had  drug-related  TEAEs  for 
palonosetron compared to 9.1% and 1% in the ondansetron control group. Similar results were observed 
within  each  palonosetron  dose  group.  Headache  was  reported  in  more  female  patients  receiving 
ondansetron  (3.0%)  than  palonosetron  (1.6%).  Drug-related  TEAEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in 
Hispanic patients receiving ondansetron (15.4%) than those receiving palonosetron (7.1%). Overall, the 
incidences  of  all  categories  of  TEAEs  were  comparable  in  patients  receiving  MEC  and  HEC,  although 
differences were observed between treatment groups,  no clear trend was identified for either treatment 
group.  
The incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly lower in patients who received palonosetron (30.3%) compared 
with  patients  who  received  ondansetron  (33.5%).  At  the  SOC  level,  serious  TEAEs  in  the  Blood  and 
lymphatic  system  disorder  SOC  were  the  most  common  overall  (22.3%)  and  in  both  treatment  groups 
(21.4% for palonosetron and 24.4% for ondansetron). The serious TEAE febrile neutropenia was the most 
commonly  reported  PT  overall  (11.1%),  with  10.9%  in  the  palonosetron  and  11.6%  in  the  ondansetron 
treatment groups. None of the serious TEAEs reported in the studies during Cycle 1 was assessed by the 
Investigator as drug-related. There was no apparent effect of palonosetron dose on the types or incidences 
of serious TEAEs.  
Only  3  paediatric  patients  withdrew  from  the  studies  because  of  a  TEAE;  2  (0.5%)  patients  in  the 
palonosetron group and 1 (0.6%) patient in the ondansetron group. In the palonosetron group one patient 
was discontinued due to febrile neutropenia and one due to a haemorrhagic stroke while in the ondansetron 
treatment group one patient was withdrawn due to febrile neutropenia. 
Common AEs CINV 
The most common TEAEs across the two paediatric trials were as expected in the context of cancer patients 
receiving  chemotherapy.  There  were  no  apparent  effects  of  palonosetron  dose,  and  no  meaningful 
differences  in  the  palonosetron  and  ondansetron  treatment  groups.  TEAEs  in  the  Blood  and  lymphatic 
system disorders SOC were the most common in both palonosetron and ondansetron groups, followed by 
TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, Investigations, 
Infections and infestations, Nervous system disorders and Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOCs. TEAEs 
belonging to other SOCs occurred in the overall database at a frequency <10% [Module 2.7.4 CINV, Table 
2-5].  
TEAEs in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC were the most common in both treatment groups 
(51.2% for palonosetron and 59.1% for ondansetron). Anaemia was the most commonly reported TEAE in 
the  palonosetron  (33.1%)  and  ondansetron  (33.5%)  treatment  groups  followed  by  thrombocytopenia 
(18.2%  palonosetron,  20.1%  ondansetron),  neutropenia  (7.4%  palonosetron,  14.0%  ondansetron)  and 
leukopenia (14.4% palonosetron, 20.7% ondansetron).  
TEAEs in the  Gastro-intestinal disorders SOC were reported in 30.1% of patients receiving palonosetron 
compared  to  34.1%  of  patients  receiving  ondansetron.  With  the  exception  of  constipation  (6.2%  of 
palonosetron  patients  compared  with  4.3%  of  patients  in  the  ondansetron  group),  TEAEs  in  the 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were generally reported with similar or lower frequencies in the palonosetron 
treatment  groups  compared  with  the  ondansetron  group.  None  of  the  25  constipations  reported  in  25 
patients receiving palonosetron were assessed by the Investigators as related to study drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 57/69 
 
  
  
TEAEs  in  the  General  disorders  SOC  occurred  in  25.9%  of  patients  in  the  palonosetron  and  19.5%  in 
ondansetron treatment groups. Events in this SOC included pyrexia, mucosal inflammation and fatigue. The 
frequency for all of these events was higher in the palonosetron group compared to ondansetron. There was 
no apparent effect of palonosetron dose on the frequency of these events.  
TEAEs in the Investigations SOC were 17.2% of patients in the palonosetron and 16.5% in the ondansetron 
treatment groups. The most common events within this SOC were decreases in white blood cells, platelets, 
neutrophils  and  lymphocytes.  There  were  no  differences  between  treatment  groups  and  no  effect  of 
palonosetron dose on the frequency of events.  
TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC occurred in 16.2% of patients in the palonosetron and 18.3% 
in the ondansetron groups. There was no individual PT that occurred in greater than 2% of patients.  
TEAEs  in  the  Nervous  system  disorders  SOC  were  11.7%  in  the  palonosetron  group  and  13.4%  in  the 
ondansetron  group.  Headache  was  reported  with  a  higher  incidence  in  patients  receiving  ondansetron 
(10.4%) compared with patients receiving palonosetron (6.5%). Headache assessed by the Investigators as 
drug-related  was  reported  for  3  (1.5%)  patients  receiving  10  mcg/kg  palonosetron,  1  (0.6%)  patient 
receiving 20 mcg/kg palonosetron, and 2 (1.2%) patients receiving ondansetron. All other TEAEs in this SOC 
were reported in less than 2% of patients.  
TEAEs in the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC occurred in 12.4% of patients in the palonosetron and 
10.4% in the ondansetron groups. The only events that occurred in greater than 2% of patients overall were 
hypoalbuminaemia,  hypokalaemia  and  hyponatraemia.  There  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  event 
frequencies between treatment groups or between palonosetron doses.  
By age group the most common TEAEs across age groups were those reflected in the overall population. 
There  were  no  notable  differences  between  age  groups  in  the  frequency  of  the  most  common  TEAEs 
including anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. The frequency of pyrexia was also similar 
across  the  age  groups  although  it  was  slightly  lower  in  the  ondansetron  2  to  <6  year  age  group.  For 
Gastrointestinal  disorders,  frequencies  were  similar  between  palonosetron  and  ondansetron-treated 
patients  except  in  the  oldest  age  group  where  31.5%  of  palonosetron  patients  reported  GI  disorders 
compared to 42.9 % of ondansetron-treated patients. Constipation was not reported for any patient <2 
years old; the relevant frequencies in the palonosetron-treated age groups ranged from 6.0% to 7.7% while 
in the ondansetron age groups they ranged from 3.6% to 8.9%. For Nervous system disorders TEAEs, there 
were some differences in the incidence by age group between palonosetron and ondansetron, however there 
was no pattern. This finding is considered to be due to the small numbers of patients reporting nervous 
system events in each age group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths PALO-10-20 
All deaths occurred during the study, including the post treatment follow-up period, and deaths that resulted 
from a process that began during the study, were considered in this section. The deaths of the patients 
deceased during the study or after the observational period, were all considered by the Investigators to be 
unrelated to study drug and are briefly described here below.  
Patient  (palonosetron  20  mcg/kg)  was  an  11-year-old  male  patient  who  received  MEC.  TEAEs  with  fatal 
outcome included Cardiac arrest, Respiratory arrest, and Loss of consciousness.  
Patient  (ondansetron)  was  a  2-year-old  female  patient  who  received  MEC.  She  died  in  the 
post-observational period (89 days after study drug administration) due to Respiratory failure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 58/69 
 
  
  
 
Patient (ondansetron) was a 15-year-old male patient who received MEC. The TEAE with fatal outcome was 
Respiratory failure.  
Patient  (ondansetron)  was  a  15-year-old  female  patient  who  received  HEC.  TEAEs  with  fatal  outcome 
included Multi-organ failure, Pulmonary haemorrhage and Staphylococcal sepsis.  
Patient (palonosetron 20 mcg/kg) was a 2-year-old male who received HEC. The TEAE with fatal outcome 
was Neoplasm progression.  
Patient  (palonosetron  20  mcg/kg)  was  a  9-year-old  male  patient  who  received  MEC.  TEAEs  with  fatal 
outcome included Brain oedema, Haemorrhagic stroke and Multi-organ failure; this last event started after 
the observational period (40 days after study drug administration).  
Patient  (ondansetron)  was  a  13-year-old  female  patient  who  received  MEC.  TEAEs  with  fatal  outcome 
included Febrile neutropenia, Candidiasis, and Multi-organ failure. 
SAEs PALO-10-20 
Overall, SAEs were reported for 68 (40.7%) patients in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group, 62 (38.0%) 
patients in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 70 (42.7%) in the ondansetron group (Table 102).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 59/69 
 
  
  
 
The  overall  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  SAEs  was  comparable  across  treatment  groups  within 
subgroup categories and generally was similar for subgroup categories within treatment. Most of the SAEs 
observed in this study are in the SOCs of Blood and lymphatic system disorders, followed by Infections and 
infestations as expected in the context of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Drug-related SAEs were 
reported for only 1 patient, with positive outcome.  
Patient was a 9-month-old, white, non-Hispanic male with rhabdomyosarcoma. Relevant medical history 
included radical tumour resection, cystectomy with prostatectomy, and bilateral uretero-cutaneous fistulae. 
He  was  administered  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  on  4  April  2012  (Cycle  2)  and  developed  Diarrhoea  (CTC 
Grade 4/severe) on 12 April 2012 (29 days after the first administration of study drug) and Dehydration 
(CTC Grade 3/severe) on 17 April 2012 (34 days after the first administration of study drug). These SAEs 
prolonged  his  hospitalisation  and  then  resolved  after  treatment.  Both  SAEs  were  considered  by  the 
Investigator to be possibly related to study drug.  
CINV 
The incidence of serious TEAEs was slightly lower in patients who received palonosetron (30.3%) compared 
with  patients  who  received  ondansetron  (33.5%).  At  the  SOC  level,  serious  TEAEs  in  the  Blood  and 
lymphatic  system  disorder  SOC  were  the  most  common  overall  (22.3%)  and  in  both  treatment  groups 
(21.4% for palonosetron and 24.4% for ondansetron). The serious TEAE febrile neutropenia was the most 
commonly  reported  PT  overall  (11.1%),  with  10.9%  in  the  palonosetron  and  11.6%  in  the  ondansetron 
treatment groups. None of the serious TEAEs reported in the studies during Cycle 1 was assessed by the 
Investigator as drug-related. There was no apparent effect of palonosetron dose on the types or incidences 
of serious TEAEs 
Laboratory findings 
PALO-10-20  
Clinical laboratory evaluations were performed at baseline and at  Visit 7 of each cycle for haematology, 
serum chemistry and urinalysis. An additional sample for serum chemistry was taken immediately after the 
end of the first study drug infusion. Hepatic and renal functions were monitored through measurements of 
AST,  ALT, bilirubin and creatinine levels, whereas impact of EDTA was evaluated by measuring levels of 
ionised calcium. 
The percentages of patients with abnormal haematology parameters reported as TEAEs was comparable 
across treatment groups. The only abnormal haematology parameter considered by the Investigator to be 
drug related was reported for Patient (palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, HEC), a 4-year-old female who developed 
Thrombocytopenia 7 days after administration of study drug during Cycle 2. This TEAE was non serious and 
resolved 3 days later. SAEs relevant to haematology abnormalities were all judged as not related to study 
drug, being effects of chemotherapy administration. 
Values  of  AST,  ALT,  bilirubin  and  creatinine  showed  no  concerns  regarding  hepatic  or  renal  functions  in 
patients of  all  treatment  groups.  SAEs  relevant  to  blood  chemistry  abnormalities  were  all  judged  as  not 
related to study drug and their incidence was very low (<2% of patients). 
No drug-related TEAEs were reported for urinalysis parameters.  
SAEs relevant to urinalysis abnormalities were all judged as not related to study drug and their incidence was 
very low (<2% of patients). 
Integrated CINV 
The incidences of laboratory shifts were generally comparable across doses and between treatment groups, 
and were consistent with shifts that would be expected in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Vital Signs: PALO-10-20  
Changes  from  baseline  in  SBP,  DBP,  and  PR  were  generally  similar  across  treatment  group,  overall  and 
within age strata. The small number of patients in the <2 years old age group and progressively decreasing 
numbers of patients in study Cycles 2, 3 and 4 precluded robust assessment of these results. The only drug 
related TEAE regarding vital signs was Hypertension reported for 1 (0.6%) patient in the ondansetron group 
PALO-10-20: ECG  
ECG abnormalities that the Investigators considered to be drug-related TEAEs were Electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged (0.6% in palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 1.2% in ondansetron arms), Sinus tachycardia (0.6% in 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and 1.2% in ondansetron arms), and Conduction disorder (0.6% in palonosetron 
10 mcg/kg and 1.2% in ondansetron arms) 
ECG outliers reported as AEs were Electrocardiogram QT prolonged for 1 patient treated with palonosetron 
20mcg/kg and for 2 patients treated with ondansetron. 
Integrated CINV: ECG 
The most common ECG abnormalities, occurring in ≥ 10% of patients in the Integrated Safety Population for 
palonosetron and/or ondansetron treatment groups were increases from baseline in heart rate ≥ 25% and 
heart  rate  values  >  100  beats/min  (9.5%  and  12.2%  for  palonosetron  and  ondansetron,  respectively), 
changes in QTcB values from ≤ 450 msec at baseline to > 450 msec post-baseline (14.9% and 22.6% for 
palonosetron and ondansetron, respectively), and changes from baseline in QTcB values of > 30 msec to ≤ 
60 msec (9.7% and 12.8% for palonosetron and ondansetron, respectively). 
 The most frequently reported ECG abnormalities occurred with lower frequencies in the palonosetron group 
compared with ondansetron control group. In general, ECG findings were reported with similar frequencies 
in the palonosetron 10 mcg/kg and 20 mcg/kg groups. When evaluated by age group, small differences were 
observed between treatment groups that are not likely to be of clinical importance. There was no apparent 
effect of treatment or dose on the 3 most commonly reported ECG abnormalities when evaluated by age 
groups

Three  patients  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  due  to  SAEs.  Febrile  neutropenia  led  to  withdrawal  of  1 
patient in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 1 patient in the ondansetron group. Haemorrhagic stroke 
led to withdrawal of 1 patient in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group [ patient died]. All of these SAEs were 
considered to be unrelated to study drug. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  general  safety  profile  observed  in  PALO-10-20  was  as  expected  considering  the  context  of  cancer 
paediatric patients receiving MEC or HEC chemotherapy. Clinically relevant differences between treatments 
in the safety profile were not observed in the overall study population or in subgroups of patients based on 
age (although a limited number of patients under 2 years of age were included), gender, race, ethnicity or 
emetogenicity of chemotherapy.  
The type and  frequency of TEAEs  was similar for palonosetron 10 mcg/kg, palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 
ondansetron. In particular, when compared to the 10 mcg/kg palonosetron lower dose level, there was no 
obvious increase in toxicity following treatment with the higher 20 mcg/kg palonosetron dosage. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  those  commonly  observed  following  chemotherapy  in  cancer 
patients and belonged to MedDRA SOCs of Blood and lymphatic disorders (most frequently reported PTs: 
Anaemia,  Thrombocytopenia,  Leukopenia  and  Neutropenia),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (most  frequently 
reported  PTs:  Vomiting,  Abdominal  pain,  Stomatitis  and  Diarrhoea)  and  General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions (most frequently reported PT: Pyrexia).  
There was no SOC or PT in which any treatment was less well tolerated than the others; progression into 
subsequent cycles did not appear to induce worsening of TEAEs in any SOC. With repeated cycles, the safety 
profile was not worse.  
Most TEAEs in each treatment group was evaluated by the Investigators as not related. Drug-related TEAEs 
were reported only during the first and second cycles of treatment for the three groups. Only 5.4% patients 
in  the  palonosetron  10  mcg/kg  group,  4.9%  in  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  and  6.1%  in  the 
ondansetron  group  reported  TEAEs  considered  to  be  drug  related.  All  related  TEAEs  were  assessed  as 
‘possibly related’ with the exception of one TEAE in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and one TEAE in the 
ondansetron  group  considered  ‘probable  related’  and  only  one  TEAE  from  the  ondansetron  group  with  a 
definite relationship to the study drug.  
The most frequently drug-related TEAEs belong to MedDRA SOC Nervous system disorders (most frequently 
reported PTs: Headache, Dizziness and Dyskinesia), which were reported in Cycle 1 in 1.8% patients in both 
the palonosetron groups and 1.2% patients in the ondansetron group, and in Cycle 2 in 1.2% patient in 
palonosetron 10 mcg/kg group and ondansetron group (none in palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group). In Cycle 1 
only, there were 0.6% patients in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group and 1.2% patients in the ondansetron 
group presenting Cardiac disorders (reported PTs: Sinus tachycardia and Conduction disorder). Events of 
the  SOC  Investigations  (reported  PT:  Electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged)  occurred  in  0.6%  and  1.1%  of 
patients in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group, and in 1.2% and 1.2% of patients in the ondansetron group 
during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, respectively.

Most  ECG  abnormalities  were  not  considered  as  drug-related  TEAEs  by  the  Investigators.  None  of  these 
abnormalities was considered as serious with one exception: a Sinus tachycardia in the ondansetron group. 
Treatment-emergent  abnormalities  were observed most  frequently  for  rhythm  and  conduction  but  these 
abnormalities should be considered in a setting of cancer paediatric patients with confounding factors and 
chemotherapy  administration.  The  DMC,  after  evaluating  all  cardiac  abnormalities  and  performing  a 
thorough review of the ECG outliers, concluded that no increased risks in children receiving palonosetron 
were found.  
In  the  whole  study,  no  patients  had  drug-related  TEAEs  with  fatal  outcome  or  discontinued  the  study 
because of drug-related TEAEs. Study treatment was not unblinded for any patient due to SUSAR.  
The  overall  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  SAEs  was  comparable  across  treatment  groups  within 
subgroup categories and generally was similar for subgroup categories within each treatment arm.  
SAEs in the SOCs of Blood and lymphatic system disorders and Infections and infestations are commonly 
observed  following  chemotherapy.  Only  one  patient  in  the  palonosetron  20  mcg/kg  group  had  SAEs 
(Diarrhoea, Dehydration) considered by the Investigator to be possibly drug-related and whose outcome 
was recovered.  
The percentages of patients with abnormal haematology parameters reported as TEAEs were comparable 
across treatment groups. There were no safety concerns for haematology and blood chemistry parameters 
in this study. Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory tests observed during the study are typical side 
effects of chemotherapy. The only abnormal haematology parameter considered by the Investigator to be 
drug-related  was  reported  as  Thrombocytopenia.  This  TEAE  was  non  serious  and  resolved  3  days  later. 
Values  of  AST,  ALT,  bilirubin  and  creatinine  showed  no  concerns  regarding  hepatic  or  renal  functions  in 
patients of all treatment groups, confirming the safety profile similar to the one seen in adults. 
The applicant considered significant AEs, regardless of seriousness: Cardiac disorders, Renal and urinary 
disorders, Hepatobiliary disorders, and Vascular disorders. Additionally, any reported event indicating 
seizures/convulsion, constipation or infusion site reaction (including thrombophlebitis) or events leading to 
withdrawal were also considered as significant. A total of 173 significant AEs were reported by 110 patients; 
only a small number of TEAEs were considered related to palonosetron (2 patients in each treatment arm) or 
ondansetron (4 cases). The three treatment groups can be considered comparable and no safety signal was 
detected. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Adverse reactions were for the most part those expected in the context of the illnesses and chemotherapy. 
There  were  no  new  safety  issues  in  the  paediatric  population  in  this  study,  and  no  clinically  relevant 
differences  between  treatments  in  the  safety  profile  in  the  overall  study  population  or  in  subgroups  of 
patients  based  on  age, gender,  race,  ethnicity  or  the  emetogenicity  of  chemotherapy.  Regarding  age,  a 
limited number of patients under 2 years of age were included (9%). This information has been included in 
section 4.2  for the consideration of the prescriber. Taking into account that safety data reported in patients 
<4 years of age were consistent with the profile of palonosetron in the four age groups evaluated in the 
PALO-10-20 study this is considered acceptable (see also discussion on efficacy).

2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Safety concerns 
Summary of safety concerns 
Important identified risks 
Important potential risks 
Missing information 
Severe constipation 
Severe hypersensitivity reactions 
QT/QTc prolongation 
Convulsive events 
Serotonin syndrome 
Effect in pregnancy 
Effect in lactating women 
Effects on fertility 
Effect in children aged less than 1 month (potential off-label use for CINV 
prevention) 
Effects in patients with end stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis 
The table above has been updated from Version 5 to Version 6 of the RMP. 
The following changes have occurred: 
1.  Under Important Identified Risks, the terms “constipation related complications” and “Anaphylaxis, 
anaphylactoid  reactions  and  shock”  were  renamed  to  “severe  constipation”  and  “severe 
hypersensitivity reactions”. 
2.  Under Important Potential Risks, the additional risk of Serotonin Syndrome was added. 
3.  Under Missing Information, the risk of “Effect in children (potential off label use)” was renamed as 
“Effect in children aged less than 1 month (potential off label use for CINV prevention)”.  
No clinically relevant differences between treatments in the safety profile were observed in the overall study 
population  or  in  subgroups  of  patients  based  on  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity  or  the  emetogenicity  of 
chemotherapy. Regarding age, a limited number of patients under 2 years of age were included (9%), so no 
firm conclusions can be drawn for this subset of patients. On the basis of the available data (and in the 
absence  of  a  formal  comparison),  the  safety  profile  of  palonosetron  in  children  seems  in  line  with  the 
established  safety  profile  in  adults  and  to  other  anti-emetics  belonging  to  same  pharmacological  class. 
Having considered the updated data in the safety specification, the PRAC agrees that the safety concerns 
listed by the MAH are appropriate.

The additional safety concern of Serotonin Syndrome was added and the related routine RMMs 
outlined. 
The PRAC, having considered the updated data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures remain sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this application, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline 
and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], which were 
reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The changes proposed to the package leaflet within this variation do not involve the addition of a large 
amount of text to the previously approved leaflet and do not require user consultation. 
As the package leaflet has undergone many changes since the original user testing was performed the 
Applicant is recommended to perform and submit user consultation on the Aloxi package leaflet with the 
next variation that involves amendments to the package leaflet. 
2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies 
Article 8 of the Paediatric Regulation does not apply to this application, since the authorised medicinal 
product is not protected by a supplementary protection certificate under Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 or by 
a patent which qualifies for the granting of the supplementary protection. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  main  proof  of  efficacy  of  palonosetron  in  paediatric  patients  in  the  indication  of  prevention  of  CINV 
comes  from  study  PALO-10-20  which  was  a  large  (502  cancer  patients)  comparative,  randomised 
double-blind  trial  for  assessment  of  palonosetron  non-inferiority  with  ondansetron,  the  currently  most 
common used 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for the prevention of CINV in paediatric patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 66/69 
 
  
  
 
For the primary efficacy endpoint complete response during first cycle CR was reported for 54.2% of patients 
treated with palonosetron 10mcg/kg, 59.4% of patients treated with palonosetron 20 mcg/kg and 58.6% of 
patients treated with ondansetron showing non-inferiority to ondansetron for the higher dose. 
In the key secondary endpoint a higher proportion of patients treated with palonosetron 20 mcg/kg showed 
a complete response on delayed phase (key secondary end-point) than those in ondansetron arm (38.8% vs 
28.8%);  CR  results  in  the  overall  phase  (0-120h)  were  similar  to  those  in  delayed  stage  (32.7% 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg vs. 24.1%).  
During  Cycle  1,  the  proportion  of  patients  reporting  no  vomiting,  or  no  emetic  episode  was  numerically 
higher in the palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group compared to the two other groups (analysis of 95% CI for the 
MH not adjusted for multiplicity). The frequency of absence of nausea in patients aged 6 years or more in 
palonosetron 20 mcg/kg group was consistently numerically higher than ondansetron across all phases. 
In line with results observed at Cycle 1, throughout study Cycles 2 to 4, palonosetron 20 mcg/kg treatment 
group most often reported the highest CR rate, the highest proportions of patients with no vomiting, patients 
with no emetic episodes and patients with no use of antiemetic rescue medications. Although not statistically 
significant,  possibly  due  to  the  progressively  lower  number  of  patients  and  despite  the  absence  of 
re-randomisation,  the  benefit  of  palonosetron  can  be  considered  maintained  in  repeat  cycles  of 
chemotherapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although the CR rates in the delayed phase were numerically higher for palonosetron 20 mcg/kg than for 
ondansetron, the efficacy of palonosetron for the prevention of delayed CINV after receiving chemotherapy 
(until 120 hours) could not be confirmed. 
Around 85% of patients in the 3 treatment arms used concomitant antiemetic as allowed if they received 
additional  MEC  or  HEC  during  day  2  to  day  6  of  the  cycle.  Therefore,  the  activity  of  these  concomitant 
antiemetic  agents  on  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  and  its  contribution  to  the  observed  effect  of 
palonosetron during the overall period cannot be ruled out.  
Furthermore the dosing of the comparator Ondansetron in order to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting did 
not follow SPC recommendation as the 3 initial IV doses should be usually followed by oral doses during the 
first 5 days after chemotherapy. Consequently, efficacy of palonosetron in delayed phase was compared 
with a weak regimen of comparator. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Adverse reactions were for the most part those expected in the context of the illnesses and chemotherapy. 
There  were  no  new  safety  issues  in  the  paediatric  population  in  this  study,  and  no  clinically  relevant 
differences  between  treatments  in  the  safety  profile  in  the  overall  study  population  or  in  subgroups  of 
patients based on age, gender, race, ethnicity or the emetogenicity of chemotherapy. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As  labelled  in  the  SmPC  data  on  Efficacy  and  safety  in  children  less  than  2  years  are  relatively  limited. 
Whereas for the youngest children covered by the indication (<4 years of age and older than one month) the 
safety data were consistent with the profile of palonosetron in the four age groups evaluated in the pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/138512/2015 
Page 67/69 
 
  
  
study no children aged less than one month were enrolled. The RMP includes potential off label use for CINV 
prevention in these latter patients as missing information. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Nausea and vomiting are distressing side effects of chemotherapy in adult and paediatric patients and may 
lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, poor nutrition anorexia imbalances, renal failure, oesophageal 
tears,  mental  deterioration,  the  discontinuation  of  potentially  beneficial  therapies  and  prolonged 
hospitalisation if inadequately controlled. Palonosetron has demonstrated patient benefit from treatment 
because it prevents and/or control incapacitating nausea and vomiting.  
Adverse reactions were for the most part those expected in the context of the illnesses and chemotherapy. 
The favourable and unfavourable effects in these studies did not differ significantly from those seen in the 
adult population. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Palonosetron 20 mcg/kg could be shown to be as effective as ondansetron in the acute phase for preventing 
CINV  in  children  aged  1  month  and  older.  In  repeat  cycles  of  chemotherapy,  although  not  statistically 
significant  possibly  due  to  the  progressively  lower  number  of  patients  and  despite  the  absence  of 
re-randomisation, the benefit of palonosetron was maintained. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
CINV  are  amongst  the  most  frequently  and  distressing  adverse  events  associated  with  the  treatment  of 
cancer.  5-HT3  receptor  antagonist  are  the  first-line  treatment  for  moderately  and  highly  emetogenic 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens in adults and children.  
Palonosetron  is  a  selective  serotonin  receptor  subtype  3  (5-HT3)  antagonists  that  was  approved  for  the 
prevention of CINV in HEC and MEC in adults.  
According to the provided information the effect of palonosetron for the prevention of acute CINV can be 
regarded  as  non-inferior  to  ondansetron  in  the  overall  paediatric  population.  However,  the  efficacy  of 
palonosetron in the prevention of delayed CINV in paediatric patients could not be confirmed in the pivotal 
trial  due  to  the  potential  confounding  effect  of  concomitant  antiemetics  (associated  with  use  of  further 
chemotherapy) during the study period and the dosing regimen used for the comparator drug.  
The SmPC already mentions in 4.4 that Aloxi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in 
the days following chemotherapy if not associated with another chemotherapy administration.  
It  is  also  noted  that  palonosetron  has  a  prolonged  half-life  in  comparison  to  ondansetron  making  it 
reasonable to understand that palonosetron could have activity beyond the acute phase of CINV. On the 
other hand in highly emetogenic CINV the emesis has a multiphasic time course whereas, in moderately 
emetogenic settings, emesis is described as a continuous phenomenon lasting for days after chemotherapy 
and fading off in days 4 to 5.  
Therefore, in accordance with the adult indication statement, the indication states that palonosetron is to be 
used  for  the  prevention  of  acute  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Janssen-Cilag International N.V. 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 10 July 2015 an application for a variation.  
The following changes were proposed:

Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include information from paediatric study 
AALL07P1.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The rationale for this Type II variation is submission of results from a phase 2 pilot trial of bortezomib in 
combination with intensive re-induction therapy for children with relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
(ALL) and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL) (Study AALL07P1). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Velcade is a reversible proteasome inhibitor indicated in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with 
Multiple Myeloma (MM), either newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory (R/R), and for newly 
diagnosed patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma, as a component of the VcR-CAP combination. At present, 
Velcade has not been approved for the treatment of paediatric patients. 
Preliminary in-vitro data suggested the potential efficacy of proteasome inhibition in paediatric ALL. 
Lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were reported to be sensitive to proteasome inhibition, and in the 
Paediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP), T-cell ALL xenografts demonstrated sensitivity to Velcade 
in vivo. Further pre-clinical and clinical studies confirmed that Velcade has synergistic anti-leukemia 
interactions when combined with dexamethasone, asparaginase, vincristine, doxorubicin, or cytarabine. 
Considering that, in spite of the significant results obtained in newly diagnosed patients, treatment of 
relapsed ALL in children is unsatisfactory (long-term survival rates ranging from 20% to 50%), further 
clinical studies were conducted with Velcade in this clinical setting. Eventually, encouraging results were 
obtained in children with relapsed ALL by the Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia (TACL) 
consortium adding Velcade to a 4-drug re-induction chemotherapy regimen which included 
dexamethasone, asparaginase, vincristine, and doxorubicin. Therefore, the MAH together with the 
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) initiated a new paediatric study in children with ALL or LL in first relapse 
(study AALL07P1). In this study Velcade (1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 in treatment block 1 and 1, 
4 and 8 in treatment block 2) was combined to a standard backbone polychemotherapy re-induction 
regimen previously tested by the COG in children with relapsed ALL (study AALL01P2).

Initially, the MAH also submitted a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) based on study 26866138PED3001, 
which was extensively discussed with the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP), and supported by 
results from study AALL07P1. However, due to changes in Velcade development plans, the PIP 
submission was withdrawn on 21 December 2011, and Study 26866138PED3001 was never initiated.  
Results from study AALL07P1 are submitted in this type II variation to comply with Article 46 of the 
Paediatric Regulation, and the MAH proposes to update section 4.2 of the SmPC with a statement 
referring the reader to currently available paediatric data in section 5.1, and section 5.1 with a brief 
summary of efficacy and safety data from study AALL07P1.  
These data are considered of interest since, in the absence of effective alternatives, the off-label use of 
bortezomib in advanced settings of paediatric ALL is not uncommon. In fact, following the publication by 
Messinger et al. (Blood, 2012) of the results obtained with a Velcade-including re-induction regimen 
developed by the TACL consortium, the addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy in order to 
overcome drug-resistance in relapsed/refractory ALL has been constantly reported by highly specialized 
centres. 
The full clinical study report (CSR) of study AALL07P1 has been submitted by the MAH for assessment. 
The provided Population PK analysis showed that the PK of bortezomib in paediatric patients was 
adequately described by a 3 compartment model. Clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing 
body surface area (BSA). However, BSA-normalized clearance was similar across age groups. These 
findings indicate that BSA-scaled dosing of bortezomib is appropriate for the paediatric patient population 
over the 2-16 years age range. The changes made to the SmPC section 5.2 are endorsed. 
From an efficacy point of view, the main endpoint of study AALL07P1 was the rate of patients who 
achieved second complete remission (CR2) at the end of the first re-induction block. Even though CR2 
definition in this study is not completely in line with present standard (see NCCN guideline for ALL ver. 
1.2015), it is considered anyhow sufficient to identify an initial clinical benefit in the form of eligibility to 
receive further consolidation through intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT).  
Sample size calculation was based on assumptions on CR rates as observed in previous study AALL01P2 
in very early (<18 months) and “early” (18 -36 months) relapsed paediatric patients with pre-B-cell ALL. 
In study AALL01P2, the same backbone standard re-induction regimen used in study AALL07P1 was 
employed. On this basis, a maximum of 60 patients was determined to be accrued, yet as a consequence 
of Amendment 5, enrollment continued beyond the pre-specified 60 patients to eventually reach 140 
subjects. Patients were stratified across 5 strata according to indication: strata 1 + 2 comprised “very 
early” (<18 months, stratum 1) and “early” (18 -36 months, stratum 2) relapsed paediatric patients with 
pre-B-cell ALL. The vast majority of eligible subjects were enrolled in strata 1+2 (strata 1 n=47 + stratum 
2 n=57), as expected due to ALL epidemiology. Patients aged > 21 years (n=4) were included in stratum 
3, patients with a T-cell phenotype were enrolled in strata 4 and 5. Stratum 4 included first-relapsed T-cell 
ALL patients (n=22), stratum 5 relapsed patients with a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) 
(n=10). 
Overall, results from study AALL07P1 were difficult to interpret, considering the lack of direct comparison 
and the significant limitations of any indirect comparison with previous study AALL01P2. An overall 61% 
CR2 rate was observed, which is lower than the 68% reported by study AALL01P2 without the addition of 
Velcade. Results in stratum 2 (patients with pre-B-ALL relapsed after 18-36 months) were unsatisfactory: 
with the combination therapy containing Velcade 36/57 (63%) patients achieved a CR2, failing to reach 
the pre-specified threshold for efficacy (88%). In comparisons, results from study AALL01P2 showed a 
CR2 rate of 79% without the addition of Velcade in a population similar to that enrolled in stratum 2. 
Interestingly, when only the first 60 evaluable patients enrolled in study AALL07P1 are considered, as for 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 5/41 
 
 
 
 
the original statistical plan, CR2 in stratum 2 is higher (79%), even though lower than the pre-specified 
threshold for efficacy (88%). CR rates observed in patients enrolled before (79%) and after (42%) 
Amendment 5 are indeed significantly different (P=0.004), so a selection bias after enrollment extension 
can be hypothesized. 
In a similar way, in stratum 1 (children with pre-B-cell ALL in very early [< 18 months] relapse), CR2 rate 
(57%), although higher than that observed without bortezomib in study AALL01P2 (45%), was lower than 
the pre-specified threshold for efficacy (60%). However, when only the first 60 evaluable patients are 
considered, the observed CR2 rate is higher (67%) and the primary objective for efficacy would be met. 
EFS rates at 12 months for stratum 1 (21%) and stratum 2 (42%) were also promising, yet, considering 
that the majority of patients relapses within the first 2-3 years after reaching CR2, more meaningful 
results (i.e. 5-year EFS) are needed to confirm efficacy. 
Stratum 4 comprised patients with T-cell ALL (n=22); the CR2 rate (15/22; 68%) in this population can 
be considered promising, since T-cell phenotype has often been considered an independent risk factor for 
treatment failure. In comparison, a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in children and 
adolescents with recurrent or refractory T-ALL treated with nelarabine showed a CR2 rate of 55%. 
Unfortunately, no long-term result form study AALL07P1 is available for this population.  
Results in stratum 5 (LL) and in Philadelphia positive ALL patients cannot be assessed due to the small 
numbers (n=10 and n=2 respectively). Results from stratum 3 (pre-B-cell ALL > 21 years) are not 
relevant to this variation. 
The MAH initially described these results only as “inconclusive” in section 5.1 of the proposed SmPC. 
Considering the possible off-label use of Velcade in this paediatric population, further efficacy details were 
considered useful. The proposed text included in section 5.1 of the SmPC was therefore integrated with all 
available CR2 and EFS data from study AALL07P1, especially with respect to patients in strata 1, 2 and 4. 
From a safety point of view, the MAH provided data for the overall safety population (including pre-B-cell 
and T-cell ALL patients together with LL patients) and for paediatric pre-B-cell ALL patients (strata 1+2) 
separately. Moreover, in order to highlight significant Velcade-related toxicity, the frequency of selected 
AEs was also compared between Velcade-containing study AALL07P1 and previous Velcade-free study 
AALL01P2. According to these data, the addition of Velcade to a standard multi-drug re-induction regimen 
is confirmed to be feasible, taking into account the low rate of Velcade dose modifications, delays and 
interruptions. In fact, only 5 patients out of 140 discontinued Velcade due to AEs and the vast majority of 
patients received all the planned Velcade administrations in block 1 (94% received 4/4 doses) and in 
block 2 (97% received 3/3 doses). 
Toxicity in ALL treatments is expected to be high, due to intensive chemotherapy and the disruption of 
bone marrow and immune system function by leukemic blasts. In fact, nearly all patients across all strata 
(96%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (TEAE), and 114 out of 140 patients (81%) a 
grade ≥  3 TEAE defined as at least possibly related to Velcade. The MAH states that no new safety 
concern was identified when Velcade was added to a standard polychemotherapy re-induction regimen.  
In effect, the higher rates of TEAEs were found in the Investigations, Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders, Infections and infestations, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, General disorders and 
Gastro-intetstinal disorders SOCs, which are known to be influenced by both Velcade and conventional 
chemotherapy toxicity, as well as by leukemia.  
Moreover, the profiles of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs and Velcade-related TEAEs are similar. Furthermore, compared 
to study AALL01P2 in which Velcade was not administered, the incidence of most grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was 
similar. Even with respect to on-treatment deaths, no significant difference in incidence between studies 
AALL07P1 (6%) and AALL01P2 (8%) can be observed.

EMA/419238/2016

However, the MAH also highlighted that, in some blocks of treatment, higher rates of infections with 
neutropenia (24% vs 18% in block1 and 22% vs 11% in block 2), increased ALT, hypokalaemia and 
hyponatraemia were observed in Velcade-including study AALL07P1 compared to Velcade-free study 
AALL01P2.  
Moreover, peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a recognized toxicity of both Vincristine and Velcade, which were 
co-administered in study AALL07P1. Although grade ≥ 3 PN was low in both studies, the rate of peripheral 
sensory neuropathy was 3% in block 1 in study AALL07P1, where 4 doses of Velcade were administered, 
compared with 0% in the Velcade-free study AALL01P2. It should also be pointed out that no information 
on possible sequelae or rates of PN resolution (which are extremely relevant in paediatric patients) were 
available for study AALL07P1.  
Additional safety concerns regard cases of severe ileus (no case of grade ≥ 3 ileus was observed in 
Velcade-free study AALL01P2 vs 3/140 [2.1%] with the Velcade-containing regimen AALL07P1) and 
pulmonary toxicity, in particular the high incidence of hypoxia (8%) observed with the addition of Velcade 
in treatment block 1. 
Considering the overall paucity of Velcade safety data in paediatric populations, the identified safety 
concerns were detailed in the proposed SmPC (integrating the information in section 5.1). 
Following the assessment of study AALL07P1, the benefit-risk balance of VELCADE in the approved 
indications remains positive.  
Scientific summary for the EPAR 
For transplant eligible patients, dose modification recommendations described for monotherapy should 
be followed (for more information, please refer to the SmPC. 
A Phase II, single arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s Oncology 
Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi agent re-induction chemotherapy in 
paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia [ALL] with T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective re-induction 
multi-agent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. VELCADE was administered only in 
Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered drugs in Block 3.  
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 18 
months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% and the 4-month event free survival rate was 44%. In 
B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis (n = 33) the CR rate was 79% and the 4-month 
event free survival rate was 73%. The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% and 
the 4-month event free survival rate was 67%. The reported efficacy data are considered inconclusive.  
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety. No new safety concerns were 
observed when VELCADE was added to the standard paediatric pre B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. 
The following adverse reactions (Grade ≥ 3) were observed at a higher incidence in the VELCADE 
containing treatment regimen as compared with a historical control study in which the backbone regimen 
was given alone: peripheral sensory neuropathy; ileus; hypoxia. No information on possible sequelae or 
rates of peripheral neuropathy resolution was available in this study. Higher incidences were also noted 
for infections with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, increased ALT, hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia. No 
recommendation on a posology can be made considering the currently available data.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Velcade (bortezomib) is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid. The product is provided as a mannitol boronic 
ester, which, in reconstituted form, consists of the mannitol ester in equilibrium with its hydrolysis 
product, the monomeric boronic acid. Velcade is a reversible proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment 
of Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). It is specifically designed to inhibit the 
chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome 
prevents the proteolysis of specific poly-ubiquitinated proteins and affects multiple signalling cascades 
within the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. Specifically, Velcade is thought to be efficacious 
in MM via its inhibition of nuclear factor κB activation, its attenuation of IL-6 mediated cell growth, a direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly through anti-angiogenic and other effects. 
At present, Velcade is indicated in the EU: 
- in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide for the induction 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated MM who are eligible for high-dose chemotherapy 
with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
- in combination with melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously 
untreated MM who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation.  
- as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone for the 
treatment of adult patients with progressive MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have 
already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
- in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated MCL who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation. 
Velcade is not indicated for use in paediatric patients; the SmPC currently states that the safety and 
efficacy of Velcade in children below 18 years of age have not been established.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasms that result from 
monoclonal proliferation and accumulation of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and 
other organs. ALL is divided into subtypes based on the presence of B- or T-cell lineage-specific 
differentiation antigens detected on the surface of leukaemic blast cells. Precursor B-cell ALL (including 
early pre-B and pre-B-cell ALL) is the most common (approximately 70% to 80%) subtype in children. 
T-cell ALL has been diagnosed in 15% to 25% of paediatric patients with ALL. It occurs more commonly 
in older adolescents and young adults than in young children, with an incidence of approximately 25% of 
all ALL in patients 16 to 21 years of age. Overall, ALL is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children 
and represents 25% of cancer diagnoses among children younger than 15 years In absolute terms, 
however, ALL is a very rare disease, even in children. Its incidence has sharp peak among children aged 
2 to 3 years (>90 per million per year), with rates decreasing to 30 per million by age 8 years (NCI at the 
NIH: Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment [PDQ], March 2013).  
Outcomes for children with newly diagnosed ALL have steadily improved over the last 60 years with 
current long-term survival rates of approximately 85%. However, treatment of relapsed disease remains 
unsatisfactory, with long-term survival rates of 20% to 50%.  
First-line treatment for ALL typically consists of a remission-induction phase, an intensification (or 
consolidation) phase and continuation / maintenance therapy to eliminate residual disease. Treatment is 
also directed to the CNS early in the clinical course to prevent relapse attributable to leukaemic cells 
sequestered in this site. All phases of treatment involve combination chemotherapy. Drugs used during 
induction would typically be vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and L-asparaginase. 
Cytarabine and methotrexate are often added during consolidation/intensification. Maintenance therapy 
frequently includes 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, steroids and vincristine.   
The initial approach in treating relapsed patients is to re-induce remission (second complete remission or 
CR2), usually employing multidrug regimens similar to that used in first induction. After remission is 
achieved, patients may proceed to further therapy that includes intensive chemotherapy or stem cell 
transplantation, depending on their risk features and/or availability of a suitable stem cell donor. 
Preliminary data suggested the potential efficacy of proteasome inhibition in paediatric ALL. In fact, 
activation of NF-κB is commonly found in paediatric ALL, and lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were 
reported to be sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. In the Paediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP), 
T-cell ALL xenografts demonstrated sensitivity to Velcade in vivo. In addition, Velcade showed a 
synergistic anti-leukemia interaction in vitro when combined with dexamethasone, asparaginase, 
vincristine, doxorubicin, or cytarabine, which are agents commonly used in ALL treatment. 
A Phase 1 study of Velcade in paediatric patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia (ADVL0317) 
demonstrated a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1.3 mg/m2. PK profiles following the first dose were 
similar to those observed in adults. The Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia (TACL) consortium 
evaluated combining Velcade with a 4-drug re-induction chemotherapy regimen, which included 
dexamethasone, asparaginase, vincristine, and doxorubicin in children with ALL in second or subsequent 
relapse. Seven of the 9 patients evaluable for bone marrow (BM) response achieved a CR; 2 patients had 
mild (Grades 1 and 2) peripheral neuropathy.  
Considering this preliminary results, the MAH agreed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of bortezomib in paediatric patients as part of the Velcade 
paediatric Written Request (WR). In collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), 2 paediatric 
studies were thus initiated: AALL07P1 (in paediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
[ALL]) and AAML1031 (in paediatric patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]). Two 
phase 1 studies previously completed by COG (ADVL0317 and ADVL0015 [in paediatric patients with 
refractory solid tumours]) provided additional supportive data.

Page 9/41 
 
 
 
 
On 16 August 2010, the MAH submitted a request for Scientific Advice regarding the development of 
VELCADE in paediatric patients with B-cell precursor ALL. The proposed study (Study 26866138PED3001) 
was subsequently discussed in a meeting with the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) on 26 October 
2010 and the final advice letter was adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) on 18 November 2010 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/686620/2010). Study AALL07P1 was referred to as 
being supportive of the development plan for Velcade treatment in paediatric patients with relapsed 
pre-B-cell ALL.  
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) based on Study 26866138PED3001 was eventually submitted in the 
EU on 31 March 2011; however due to changes in the development plans for Velcade, the PIP submission 
was subsequently withdrawn on 21 December 2011, and Study 26866138PED3001 was not initiated. 
The purpose of this variation is to submit, as required by with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation, 
study AALL07P1 initiated to address a paediatric written request by FDA.

new additional pharmacovigilance or risk management activities have been considered necessary by the 
MAH. 
4.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
4.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The data used to develop the PK model came from 2 studies in paediatric patients, AALL07P1 and 
AAML1031. PK samples were collected on Day 8 which was the third dose of the treatment block/phase 
where bortezomib was administered. Plasma concentrations of bortezomib were measured using a

validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay with a dynamic range of 0.100 to 25.0 
ng/mL.  
4.2.2.  Results 
The objective of the Population PK analysis was to characterize paediatric PK of bortezomib following 
twice weekly repeat dosing in paediatric patients in the 2-11 years and 12-16 years age groups by 
nonlinear mixed effects population modelling using data from 2 clinical trials (AALL07P1 and AAML1031). 
The population PK analysis included 62 patients in the 2-11 years old age group and 42 patients in the 
12-16 years old age group. The final PK database included 104 patients and 571 concentrations. A sparse 
PK sampling scheme was employed in both studies.  
The plasma concentration-time data collected was analyzed using mixed effects modelling methods as 
implemented by the computer program NONMEM (version 7, level 2), compiled using Intel Fortran 
Parallel Studio 2011, installed on a grid server system running Windows Server 2008 x64-bit. The 
installation of NONMEM has been qualified and all relevant patches and upgrades have been installed. 
Diagnostic graphics, exploratory analyses, and post-processing of NONMEM output were performed using 
R version 3.02 or higher and XPOSE.  
Modelling was performed using the first-order conditional estimation method (FOCE). The parameter 
precision was estimated by the asymptotic standard errors and nonparametric bootstrapped confidence 
interval (CI). There was a successful covariance step at all critical model building steps. The final basic 
structural model was selected on the basis of goodness-of-fit (GOF) as judged by change in objective 
function (OBJ), and various diagnostic plots. 
The population PK structural model employed in this analysis consisted of three basic components: 
1. The structural PK model component, which adequately defines the PK parameters of bortezomib, 
2. The inter-individual error model component, which describes the inter-individual variation in PK 
parameters after correction for fixed effects, and 
3. The residual error model component, which describes the underlying distribution of the error in the 
measured PK observations. 
Decision making during model building was guided by evaluation of the change in OBJ between model 
runs, evaluation of the magnitude of inter-individual and residual variance, and examination of diagnostic 
residual plots. 
The following covariates were assessed for influence on the PK and PK variability of bortezomib: 
The effects of other covariates including disease type/study, gender, background treatment etc. were 
explored graphically and if strong visual trends were evident, they were formally tested as covariates.

Basic model. Visual exploration of the observed bortezomib concentration versus time since last dose 
profile showed that after a 3-5 second IV push dose the concentrations decreased in a multi-exponential 
manner indicative of a multi-compartmental PK model. One, two, three and four compartment linear 
models were tested. The most complex 4 compartment model had the lowest OBJ however based on the 
condition number of 1581, the model was over-parameterized. Therefore the simpler 3 compartment 
linear CL model that had the next lowest OBJ was selected as the base structural model, supported by 
goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots. 
Evaluation of the base model showed that in general there was acceptable concordance between the 
population and individual predicted concentrations with the observed concentrations. 
Final model development included the examination of covariate influences on the parameters with IIV 
terms. Single covariate runs showed that an effect of BSA on CL resulted in the largest decrease (~47 
points) in OBJ. Age and weight also decreased the OBJ by approximately 40 points. Based on BSA on CL 
showing the lowest OBJ value and the observation that many of the trends in covariate versus ETA plots 
were less pronounced with inclusion of this effect, a BSA effect on CL was added to the model. At this 
stage the effect of BSA on V1 and Q3 was evaluated. BSA was added to all parameters and then dropped 
singly to evaluate the impact on the OBJ. The results showed that removing the BSA effect on V1 resulted 
in 1.19 point increase in the OBJ while removing it from Q3 or CL resulted in a 9.9 and 59.9 point increase 
in the OBJ, respectively. Therefore the model used for further covariate effect analysis included BSA on CL 
and Q3 only. The other covariates were tested by a forward selection process where all the covariate 
effects were tested singly and then the statistically significant covariates (p<0.01; OBJ decrease greater 
than 6.6) were included in a full model. There were statistically significant effects of treatment plan for the 
ALL patients that were late relapse on CL and V1 and there was an age effect on Q3. The full model 
included these covariate effects. A backward elimination process was performed on the full model where 
each covariate effect was eliminated singly until removal of the covariate resulted in an increase in the 
OBJ by 10.8 which indicates a statistically significant effect at a p<0.001 level. Three rounds of 
backward elimination steps resulted in all 3 effects dropping out of the model. Therefore the final model 
was the base model which included a BSA effect on CL and Q3 and a study effect on RV. The parameter 
estimates for the final model are shown in the following Table.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 12/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The precision of the parameter estimates were acceptable with standard errors of ~4 to ~23%.  
Model evaluation concluded that the fit of the data was acceptable. These assessments included GOF 
plots, NPDE, plots of IPRED and population PRED overlaid onto the observed concentration and versus 
time since last dose. All these indicated the model adequately describes the data. Notably the final model 
adequately accounted for heterogeneity in age range through incorporation of BSA effects on CL and Q3. 
The following table summarizes the BSA normalized parameters for each age group

These data show little difference by age group for CL and Q3. The nearly identical geometric mean values 
of BSA-normalized clearance (which is the determinant of total systemic exposure [AUC] following 
BSA-scaled dosing) between the two age groups supports the BSA-scaled dosing of bortezomib. 
There was no readily apparent difference in the PK parameters based on risk group in AAML1031 or 
treatment stratum in AALL07P1. 
In conclusion, the results of this population PK analysis support the conclusion that BSA-scaled dosing of 
bortezomib is appropriate for the paediatric patient population over the 2-16 years age range and that 
total systemic exposures following BSA-scaled dosing should be generally comparable in patients with 
ALL or AML administered bortezomib in the contexts of treatment employed in Protocols AALL07P1 and 
AAML1031. 
4.2.3.  Discussion 
The Population PK analysis showed that the PK of bortezomib in paediatric patients was adequately 
described by a 3 compartment model. Clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface 
area (BSA). However, BSA-normalized clearance was similar across age groups. These findings indicate 
that BSA-scaled dosing of bortezomib is appropriate for the paediatric patient population over the 2-16 
years age range. The changes made to the SmPC section 5.2 are endorsed.  
4.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
4.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
An open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study (COG Study AALL07P1) was conducted by COG of the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) with support from the MAH. Seventy-nine centers in the United States (US) and 
Canada enrolled subjects in first relapse between the ages of 1 and 21 years. 
Patients were considered eligible and classified in the following 5 strata based on disease type, age, and 
time from initial diagnosis to relapse: 
- Stratum 1: pre-B-cell ALL patients less than or equal to 21 years old with relapse less than 18 months 
from diagnosis (R<18 months, very early relapse [VER]) 
- Stratum 2: pre-B-cell ALL patients less than or equal to 21 years old with relapse 18 to 36 months from 
diagnosis (R=18-36 months, early relapse ([ER]) 
- Stratum 3: pre-B-cell ALL patients older than 21 years 
- Stratum 4: T-cell ALL in first relapse 
- Stratum 5: T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) in first relapse 
Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL were not eligible unless refractory to at least one 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy or unable to tolerate TKI therapy due to toxicity. Patients with 
mature B-cell ALL, defined as presenting a surface immunoglobulin positive and kappa- or 
lambda-restricted positivity, a French-American- British L3 morphology and/or a myc translocation, were 
not eligible. 
Study treatments 
Velcade was added to a standard backbone re-induction chemotherapy developed by COG in the previous 
study AALL01P2 and administered in three separate blocks, as summarised in figure below: 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 14/41 
 
 
 
 
Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 was administered only in Block 1, together with cytarabine, vincristine, doxorubicin, 
prednisone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate (for CNS-negative patients) or methotrexate 
plus hydrocortisone and cytarabine (for CNS-positive patients), and in Block 2, together with 
methotrexate (for CNS-negative patients) or methotrexate/hydrocortisone/cytarabine (for CNS-positive 
patients) and etoposide, cyclophosphamide, filgrastim, high-dose methotrexate, and leucovorin. Velcade 
was not administered in Block 3 to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with the co-administered drugs 
(especially high-dose cytarabine and L-asparaginase).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Bone  marrow  was  evaluated  at  the  end  of  Block  1.  Criteria  to  determine  response  followed  COG 
convention and were as follows: 
Second Complete remission (CR2) was defined as attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) with 
no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral counts (ANC 
> 750/μL and platelet count > 75.000/μL) before the start of Block 2. 
Partial remission (PR) was defined as complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of M2 
marrow status (≥ 5% or < 25% blast cells and adequate cellularity). 
Stable disease (SD) was determined for a patient who failed to qualify for CR, PR, or PD. 
Progressive disease (PD) was defined as an increase of at least 25%, or an absolute increase of at least 
5000/μL  (whichever  is  greater),  in  the  number  of  circulating  leukemia  cells,  development  of 
extramedullary disease, or other laboratory or clinical evidence of PD. 
Clinical  response  evaluation  of  LL  patients  was  based  on  the  response  criteria  in  adult  Non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma  (NHL)  reported  by  the  “NCCN  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  in  Oncology:  Non-Hodgkin 
Lymphomas” (Version 3, 2011). Accordingly, Second Complete Response (CR2) for these patients was 
defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease from all sites for at least 4 weeks, as determined 
by physical examination and appropriate imaging studies.  
Objectives 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 15/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary objectives of study AALL07P1 were to estimate the toxicity of the combination regimen, the rate 
of second complete remission (CR2) at the end of Block 1, and the overall 4-month event-free survival 
(EFS).  
Secondary objectives included the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) following completion of 
each therapy block, the investigation of biologic pathways associated with response and drug resistance 
and the determination of the bortezomib-induced inhibition of lymphoblast NF-κB activity in leukemia 
patients. 
In the course of the study, the following changes in the planned analyses were implemented:  
- the 12-month EFS was added as a post-hoc secondary endpoint for patients in Strata 1 and 2.  
- efficacy analyses were also conducted using data across all strata. 
Sample size and statistical analysis 
The original overall CR2 rate observed in the previous AALL01P2 study was 68% for pre-B-cell ALL 
patients who relapsed <36 months from diagnosis. For early relapses (< 18 months from diagnosis, 30% 
of relapses), the CR2 rate was reported to be 45% (95%CI: 23%-67%). CR2 rate for patients who 
relapsed from 18 to 36 months of initial diagnosis was 79% (95% CI: 67%-91%). Due to the observed 
difference in CR2 rates relative to the time from initial diagnosis to relapse, a stratified phase 2 design 
was used to determine the needed sample size in Study AALL07P1. In Stratum 1 (relapse < 18 months), 
the null hypothesis was that the CR2 rate is ≤ 40% (inactive) versus the alternative hypothesis that the 
CR2 rate is ≥ 60% (active regimen). In Stratum 2 (relapse 18-36 months), the null hypothesis was that 
the CR2 rate is ≤ 78% (inactive) versus the alternative hypothesis that the CR2 rate is ≥ 88% (active). 
On the basis of these assumptions, a maximum of 60 patients (2 stages, 30 patients for each stage) were 
to be accrued to Strata 1 and 2.  
Accordingly, the original data cut-off for study AALL07P1 was based on the pre-specified accrual target 
that occurred approximately 9.5 months after 60 evaluable pre-B-cell ALL patients were enrolled in Strata 
1 and 2. However, as per Amendment 5 of the study protocol, enrollment remained open beyond the 
originally planned 60 evaluable patients. A snapshot of the study database was taken anyway 
approximately 9.5 months after the 60th evaluable pre-B-cell ALL patient in Strata 1 and 2 was enrolled 
to enable analysis of 4-month EFS.  
Analysis populations 
The following Analysis Populations were defined: 
Safety Population: all enrolled patients across all indications who received at least 1 dose of Velcade. All 
safety analyses were performed using the safety population. 
First 60 evaluable population in Strata 1 and 2: the first 60 patients in Strata 1 and 2, as pre-specified, 
who received at least 1 dose of VELCADE and completed Block 1 of therapy. Patients who failed (PD, toxic 
death) were also evaluable for response.  
All-evaluable population in Strata 1 and 2: all patients in Strata 1 and 2 (including patients enrolled after 
Amendment 5) who were considered response-evaluable on the basis of study chair assessment. 
4.3.2.  Results 
Study patients disposition and protocol deviations 
As of the data cut-off of 31 December 2013, Velcade had been administered to 140 patients across the 5 
strata (see Table below). 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 16/41 
 
 
 
 
 
With respect to the first 60 evaluable patients in Strata 1 and 2, all patients were off protocol therapy at 
the time of data cut-off; no patients were lost to follow-up. One patient (4%) from Stratum 1 was enrolled 
in another COG study for further therapeutic intent. The overall safety population included 140 patients 
across all 5 strata, of whom 135 (96%) were off protocol therapy and 5 patients (4%) were ongoing at the 
time of data cut-off (31 Dec 2013). Four patients (3%) were lost to follow-up, including 2 patients from 
each of Stratum 2 and Stratum 4. Two patients (1%) were enrolled in another COG study for further 
therapeutic treatment and included 1 patient from each of Stratum 1 and Stratum 4. A total of 104 of the 
140 patients had a diagnosis of relapsed pre-B-cell ALL and were ≤ 21 years (Strata 1 and 2). 
Forty-six patients (33%) completed planned therapy, including 10 patients (21%) in Stratum 1 and 22 
patients (39%) in Stratum 2. The most common primary reason for discontinuation of therapy was 
physician’s determination of patient’s best interest (33 patients, 24%), followed by PD (22 patients, 16%) 
and second relapse at any site (17 patients, 12%). Five patients (4%) died, including 2 patients (4%) in 
Stratum 1 and 3 patients (5%) in Stratum 2. Ninety patients (64%) were receiving anti-cancer therapy 
outside of protocol treatment during the study that consisted most commonly of chemotherapy (66 
patients, 47%) and stem cell transplant (HSCT) (47 patients, 34%). Thirty-two patients (31%) in 
Stratum 1 + 2 underwent HSCT, 10 (21%) patients in Stratum 1 and 22 (39%) patients in Stratum 2. 
Data on protocol deviations were not available. 
Baseline characteristics  
Demographic characteristics for all strata are summarised in Table below.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

Median age for the overall population was 10 years (range 1 – 26), while for the overall pre-B-cell 
paediatric population (n=104) was 8 years. Demographics for the first 60 patients in strata 1 + 2 were 
consistent with that of strata 1 + 2 of the overall population. 
Baseline disease characteristics for all strata are summarised in Tables below.

Across all strata, 122 patients (87%) had reported a prior anti-cancer therapy at the time of data cut-off, 
with the majority of those patients (117 patients) receiving systemic multi-agent chemotherapy. Six of 
the 8 patients receiving BM transplants were in Stratum 1 (pre-B-cell pediatric ALL relapsed within 18 
months of initial diagnosis), and 6 of the 8 patients who received limited radiation were in Stratum 4 
(T-cell ALL).  
Primary endpoint 
CR2 rates 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients in Strata 1 and 2 who achieved CR2 at the 
end of Block 1. Clinical responses obtained for all strata in the overall safety population are summarised 
in Table below. 
Forty-four patients (73%) of the pre-specified population which included the first 60 evaluable patients 
achieved CR2 at this time point, 67% in Stratum 1 and 79% in Stratum 2. With respect to the overall 
population, 63/104 (61%) patients in Strata 1+2 (all paediatric patients with pre-B-cell ALL) achieved a 
CR2 27/47 (57%) patients in Stratum 1 and 36/57 (63%) in Stratum 2. Fifteen out of 22 (68%) patients 
with T-cell ALL in first relapse obtained a CR2, and 1/10 (10%) patients with T-cell LL. 
EFS 
The EFS analyses using the safety population of strata 1+2 (n=104) are summarised in table and figures 
below.

Of the first 60 patients in strata 1 + 2 41 (68%) had events, and 19 (32%) were censored at last visit. The 
4-month estimated EFS was 44% for Stratum 1 and 73% for Stratum 2. The 12-month estimated EFS was 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 21/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26% for Stratum 1 and 50% for Stratum 2. At a median follow-up of 308 days, the median EFS was 92 
days for Stratum 1 and 448 days for Stratum 2. 
Bone marrow blasts in pre-B-cell ALL patients 
With  respect  to  the  overall  safety  population,  97  of  104  patients  in  Strata  1  and  2  had  BM  samples 
collected  and  assessed  at  the  end  of  Block  1.  The  majority  of  these  patients  (70;  72%)  had  BM 
classification  M1  that  included  30  patients  (68%)  in  Stratum  1  and  40  patients  (75%)  in  Stratum  2. 
Results from the first 60 evaluable pre-B-cell ALL paediatric patients were consistent with those of the 
overall population, with a M1 BM observed in 18/26 (69%) patients in Stratum 1 and 26/33 (79%) in 
Stratum 2. 
Results for all strata are summarised in Table below. 
Absolute neutrophil and peripheral platelet counts for patients with a CR 
Within the first 60 evaluable pre-B-cell ALL paediatric patients in Strata 1 and 2, 43 of the 44 patients who 
achieved CR2 at the end of Block 1, had median ANC of 1344/μL, with a range of 800 to 9240/μL. At the 
end of Block 3, the median ANC increased to 2500/μL with a range of 988 to 171,000/μL across the 23 
patients with CR. Among 43 of the 44 patients with CR2 at the end of Block 1, the median peripheral 
platelet count was 186,000/μL, with a range of 76,000 to 423,000/μL. At the end of Block 3, the median 
peripheral platelet count increased to 307,000/μL, with a range of 82,000 to 7,320,000/μL across the 23 
patients with CR. In the safety population, similar median values were observed when all the patients in 
Strata 1 and 2 who achieved a CR were included. 
Response at the End of Block 3 
Among the patients in the safety population in Strata 1 and 2, 29 of 104 patients (28%) achieved CR at 
the  end  of  Block  3,  including  9  patients  (19%)  in  Stratum  1  and  20  patients  (35%)  in  Stratum  2.  In 
addition to the 2 patients who were not evaluated for response, 2 patients (1 each in Strata 1 and 2) 
experienced PD. Response at the end of Block 3 was not reported in the remaining 71 patients (68%), 36 
in Stratum 1 and 35 in Stratum 2. Of the first 60 evaluable patients in Strata 1 and 2, 23 patients (38%) 
achieved CR at the end of Block 3, including 8 patients (30%) in Stratum 1 and 15 patients (45%) in 
Stratum 2. Two patients, 1 in each stratum, were not evaluated for response. Response at the end of 
Block 3 was not reported in the remaining 35 patients (58%), 18 in Stratum 1 and 17 in Stratum 2.

4.3.3.  Discussion 
In order to comply with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation, the MAH submitted the results from the 
open-label, phase 2 single-arm study AALL07P1, in which Velcade was used to treat paediatric patients 
with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, Velcade was administered in 
combination with a standard multi-drug chemotherapy induction regimen for relapsed ALL which had 
already been tested by the COG group in previous study AALL01P2. This multi-drug chemotherapy 
backbone was composed by 3 separate treatment blocks. In the first block, in study AALL07P1 Velcade 
was administered at the standard posology employed in the current approved indications in adults (1.3 
mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, in combination with vincristine, peg-asparaginase, doxorubicin and 
prednisone. In block 2, only 3 doses of Velcade were planned (days 1, 4 and 8) to be co-administered with 
cyclophosphamide, etoposide and high dose methotrexate. Velcade was not included in Block 3 to avoid 
potential overlapping toxicities with high dose cytarabine and L-asparaginase. In the light of pre-clinical 
results, the rational of adding Velcade to a standard re-induction regimen to overcome drug resistance is 
shared, and the chosen chemotherapy backbone is considered well representative of then-current 
paediatric treatments in relapsed ALL. 
The main endpoint was the rate of patients who achieved second complete remission (CR2) at the end of 
the first re-induction block. Although the chosen CR definition is not completely in line with the most used 
current response definitions (see NCCN guideline for ALL ver. 1.2015), it can be acceptable since 
encompasses both bone marrow normalisation (blasts < 5%) and the disappearance of any sign of 
leukemia. These criteria are considered in fact sufficient to identify clinical responders who may benefit 
from further consolidation through intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT). 
According to the original study protocol, sample size determination was based only on strata 1+2. 
Considering that, without the addition of Velcade to the re-induction regimen, previous study AALL01P2 
showed a 45% CR2 rate for “very early” relapsed patients and a 79% CR2 rate for “early” relapsed 
patients, a ≥ 60% CR2 rate in stratum 1 and ≥ 88% in stratum 2 were assumed to confirm Velcade clinical 
efficacy. On this basis, a maximum of 60 patients were determined to be accrued, yet as a consequence 
of Amendment 5, enrollment continued beyond the pre-specified 60 patients to eventually reach 140 
patients across all 5 strata (104 in strata 1+2).  
Patients in study AALL07P1 were divided in 5 strata according to indication: strata 1 + 2 comprised “very 
early” (<18 months) and “early” (18 -36 months) relapsed paediatric patients with pre-B-cell ALL. The 
vast majority of eligible subjects were enrolled in strata 1+2 (strata 1 n=47 + stratum 2 n=57), as 
expected due to ALL epidemiology. Patients aged > 21 years (n=4) were included in stratum 3, while 
patients with a T-cell phenotype were enrolled in strata 4 and 5. Stratum 4 was composed by T-cell ALL 
patients (n=22), stratum 5 by patients with a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) (n=10). 
Since patients with Philadelphia-positive ALL could be enrolled in study AALL07P1 only whether 
non-responsive or intolerant to TKIs, only 2 Bcr-Abl + patients were eventually evaluable. Due to such 
small numbers, no efficacy or safety assessment is possible for this population. 
As expected in an early relapsed population, frequently reported adverse prognostic factors (i.e. age > 10 
years at diagnosis, T-cell phenotype and high bone marrow [BM] blast count at relapse), were not 
uncommon at baseline. Median BM blast count across all ALL strata was 70%, approximately 23% of 
patients had a T-cell phenotype, median age was 10 years across all strata, and 32%, 37% and 59% of 
patients in strata 1, 2 and 4 respectively were older than 12 years. Unfortunately, no biologic and 
cytogenetic data were reported. The vast majority of patients were as expected already pretreated with 
intensive chemotherapy at diagnosis, and 8 subjects relapsed after HSCT (6/8 in stratum 1).  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016

Conventional chemotherapy alone in the relapsed setting is often insufficient to achieve long-term 
survival, although most patients are able to achieve an initial CR2. Historical results by the BFM group 1 
showed that patients in early or very early relapse had approximately a 25-30% 5-year overall survival 
(OS) rates. 
Efficacy results from study AALL07P1 are difficult to interpret, considering the lack of direct comparisons 
and the limitations of an indirect comparison with previous study AALL01P2. Overall, a 61% CR2 rate has 
been observed, which is lower than the 68% reported by study AALL01P2 without the addition of Velcade. 
Results in stratum 2 (patients with better prognosis) are unsatisfactory: with the combination therapy 
containing Velcade 36/57 (63%) patients reached a CR2, failing to reach the pre-specified threshold for 
efficacy of 88%. In comparisons, results from study AALL01P2 showed a CR2 rate of 79% without the 
addition of Velcade in a population similar to that enrolled in stratum 2. Interestingly, when only the first 
60 evaluable patients enrolled in study AALL07P1 are considered, as for the original statistical plan, CR2 
in stratum 2 is higher (79%), even though lower than the pre-specified threshold for efficacy (88%). CR 
rates observed in patients enrolled before (79%) and after (42%) Amendment 5 are indeed significantly 
different (P=0.004), so a selection bias after enrollment extension can be hypothesized. 
Stratum 1 comprised the higher risk population: children with pre-B-cell ALL in very early (< 18 months) 
relapse. In this population, the CR2 rate (57%) in study AALL07P1 is higher than that observed without 
bortezomib in study AALL01P2 (45%), yet lower than the pre-specified threshold for efficacy (60%). As 
for stratum 2, when only the first 60 evaluable patients are considered, the observed CR2 rate is higher 
(67%) and the primary objective for efficacy would be met.  
It can be acknowledged that results are heavily influenced by small numbers and high variability, yet a 
possible benefit in the addition of Velcade to standard re-induction chemotherapy in very early relapsed 
pre-B-cell ALL patients cannot be excluded. EFS rates at 12 months for stratum 1 (21%) and stratum 2 
(42%) were also promising, yet, considering that the majority of patients relapse within the first 2-3 
years after reaching CR2, more meaningful results (i.e. 5-year EFS) are needed to confirm efficacy. For 
instance, an updated analysis of longer-term EFS rates from the AALL01P2 study2 showed that the 5-year 
EFS rates for relapses occurring < 18 months and 18-36 months from initial diagnosis were 11% ± 7% 
and 24% ± 9% respectively.  
Stratum 4 comprised patients with T-cell ALL (n=22); the CR2 rate (15/22; 68%) in this population is also 
promising. In the past, T-cell phenotype has been often considered an independent risk factor for 
treatment failure in relapsed ALL patients. In comparison, a phase II open-label, single-arm, multicenter 
study of nelarabine in children and adolescents with recurrent or refractory T-ALL showed that 55% of 
children in first relapse had an objective response (CR + PR) to treatment with nelarabine. No long-term 
result is available for this population. Results in stratum 5 (LL) cannot be assessed due to small numbers 
(n=10), and results from stratum 3 (pre-B-cell ALL > 21 years) are not relevant to this variation. 
The  text  originally  proposed  by  the  MAH  for  the  SmPC  did  not  report  any  data  from  study  AALL07P1 
beyond “efficacy data are considered inconclusive”. Considering the possible off-label use of Velcade in 
this paediatric population and the ongoing research efforts (at least 2 studies3 were ongoing/planned in 
paediatric T-cell ALL), further efficacy details were considered useful. Consequently, the MAH included in 
the SmPC all the requested modifications to section 5.1 of the SmPC (see Section 6 below).

The  proposed  SmPC  is  now  considered  sufficiently  informative  with  respect  to  the  use  of  Velcade  in 
paediatric ALL patients. All efficacy issues are resolved. 
4.4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
In the single-arm study AALL07P1 the safety of Velcade when co-administered with a multiagent 
reinduction chemotherapy was assessed separately in the overall safety population of subjects who had 
received at least 1 dose of study drug by the data cut-off date (N=140) and in the subjects with pre-B-cell 
ALL in Strata 1 and 2 (n=104): 7 infants less than 2 years of age, 61 children between the ages of 2 years 
up to 12 years, 19 adolescents between the ages of 12 years to younger than 17 years, and 17 adults 
between the ages of 17 and 21 years. There are no data in paediatric patients with ALL under 1 year of 
age.  
Since AALL07P1 was a single-arm study, key safety results were compared with data from COG Study 
AALL01P2, in which the backbone chemotherapy regimen also employed in study AALL07P1 was originally 
tested. 
4.4.2.  Results 
Extent of exposure 
Across all strata, all 140 patients in the safety population received at least 1 dose of Velcade in Block 1 of 
treatment and 102 (73%) received at least 1 dose in Block 2. In Block 1, 94% (131 of 140) of patients 
received the maximum of 4 doses of Velcade and in Block 2, 97% (99 of 102) of patients received the 
maximum of 3 doses of Velcade. The median number of doses overall was 7, which was also the 
maximum number of doses to be administered. Median duration of treatment across all strata ranged 
from 67.0 to 84.0 days. Exposure data regarding the first 60 evaluable patients in Strata 1 + 2 are 
consistent with that of the overall population. 
Dose modifications and discontinuation 
Per protocol, known Velcade-related toxicities resulted in planned VELCADE dose modifications. Dose 
reductions were planned for peripheral neuropathy (PN) Grades 1 to 3 with or without pain, Grade 3 
pulmonary toxicities, persistent myelosuppression (neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) following Block 1 
therapy, or hyperbilirubinemia.  
Across all strata in the safety population, the majority of patients did not require a dose modification in 
Block 1 (123 of 140 patients, 88%) or Block 2 (86 of 103 patients, 83%). Twelve of 140 patients (9%) had 
planned dose modifications during Block 1, including 8 patients with paediatric pre-B-cell ALL (5 patients 
[11%] in Stratum 1 and 3 patients [5%] in Stratum 2). In Block 2, 15 of 103 patients (15%) had planned 
dose modifications, including 9 patients with paediatric pre-B-cell ALL (4 [12%] patients in Stratum 1 and 
5 patients [11%] in Stratum 2). Unplanned dose modifications occurred in 5 of 140 patients (4%) in Block 
1 and in 2 of 103 patients (2%) in Block 2.  
Dose delays due to VELCADE-related AEs occurred in 13 of 140 patients (9%) in Block 1 (2 patients [4%] 
and 6 patients [11%] in Strata 1 and 2, respectively) and in 10 of 103 patients (10%) in Block 2 that 
included 4 patients (12%) in Stratum 1 and 5 patients (11%) in Stratum 2. A similar trend was observed 
with respect to the first 60 evaluable patients in Strata 1 + 2.

Five patients in the safety population experienced an AE (including hypoxia, Escherichia infection 
[catheter], caecitis (typhlitis), Pseudomonas infection [catheter], and pancreatitis) that led to 
discontinuation of Velcade, all during Block 1. Two of these events, Escherichia infection in one patient 
and Pseudomonas infection in another patient resulted in modification of the Velcade dose. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
The overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across all strata in the safety 
population is shown in Table below.  
Among the first 60 patients enrolled in Strata 1 and 2, the TEAE profile was overall consistent with that of 
the overall evaluable patients (n=104) in Strata 1 and 2.  
TEAEs reported in ≥ 10% of patients, organized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred 
Terms are summarised in Tables below.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 26/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, a similar profile of TEAEs was observed in the safety population as was seen in the first 60 
evaluable patient population, with 135 of 140 patients (96%) experiencing at least 1 TEAE. The MedDRA 
SOCs in which PTs were reported in ≥ 50% of patients included Investigations (119 patients [85%]); 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders (104 patients [74%]); Infections and infestations (87 patients 
[62%]); and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (74 patients [53%]). Sepsis was the most frequently 
reported PT within the Infections and infestations SOC, occurring in 11 of 135 patients (8%, 4 of 44 
patients [9%] in Stratum 1 and 6 of 55 patients [11%] in Stratum 2). In the overall population (and 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016

consistently in both Stratum 1 and 2) the PTs reported with highest incidence in the safety population 
were platelet count decreased (72%), neutrophil count decreased (68%), anemia (64%), WBC count 
decreased (60%), and febrile neutropenia (43%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in 20 of 
140 patients (14%) in the safety population and with comparable frequency (11%) in patients in Stratum 
1 and Stratum 2. 
AEs were only considered related to Velcade if the investigator indicated a relationship of possible, 
probable, or definite, while any other potential relationship to the backbone chemotherapy has not been 
presented. At least 1 Velcade-related AE was reported in 116 of 140 patients (83%) across all strata in the 
safety population and in 84 of 104 patients (81%) in Strata 1 and 2. The most frequently observed 
Velcade-related AEs in the overall safety population included platelet count decreased (51%), neutrophil 
count decreased (50%), WBC count decreased (45%), anemia (45%), febrile neutropenia (24%), and 
lymphocyte count decreased (22%). Similar resultsts were observed for patients in Stratum 1 and 
Stratum 2, with the exceptions of anemia in 36% and 51%, respectively, and lymphocyte count 
decreased in 28% and 19%, respectively. Velcade-related AEs observed in ≥ 10% of patients by MedDRA 
SOCs in which individual PTs were observed in fewer than 10% of patients included Infections and 
infestations in 50 patients (36%) and Gastrointestinal disorders in 29 patients (21%). Velcade-related 
AEs were similar in the first 60 evaluable patients in Strata 1+2. 
TEAEs with severity Grade ≥ 3 
In the safety population, 134 out of 140 patients (96%) experienced at least 1 Grade ≥ 3 TEAE (see 
Tables below). 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 28/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution of Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were similar between the first 60 evaluable patients in strata 1+2, the 
safety population and the overall 104 patients in Strata 1+2.  
Peripheral neuropathies NEC (HLT) were reported for 7 of 140 patients (5%), which included reports of 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (PT) in 5 patients (4%). In the MedDRA SOC Infections and infestations, 
reported in 62% (87 of 140 patients) of the overall safety population and in 61% (63 of 104 patients) in 
Strata 1 and 2, no individual PT was observed in ≥ 10% of the safety population; however, sepsis was 
reported in 10 of 104 (10%) patients in Strata 1 and 2 that included 4 of 47 (9%) patients in Stratum 1 
and 6 of 57 (11%) patients in Stratum 2.  
Among patients in the safety population, 114 of 140 patients (81%) experienced at least 1 
Velcade-related Grade ≥ 3 TEAE. Within the safety population, the most commonly reported 
VELCADE-related Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs in ≥ 5% of patients were platelet count decreased, 51%; neutrophil 
count decreased, 50%; anemia and WBC count decreased, 45% each; febrile neutropenia, 24%; and 
lymphocyte count decreased, 22%. In the safety population, there were 4 reports of Velcade-related 
Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathies NEC (HLT) of which peripheral sensory neuropathy (PT), was reported 
in 1 patient in each of Strata 2, 3, and 4, and 1 event of peripheral motor neuropathy in a patient in 
Stratum 4. VELCADE-related Grade ≥ 3 events in the MedDRA SOC Infections and infestations were 
reported in 50 of 140 patients (36%) of the overall safety population. Of PTs within this SOC, sepsis was 
observed most often and was reported in 7 of 140 patients (5%), 2 patients in Stratum 1 and 5 patients 
in Stratum 2. 
The most commonly reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs by PTs in Block 1 included platelet count decreased, 61%; 
neutrophil count decreased, 55%; WBC count decreased, 49%; anemia, 41%; febrile neutropenia, 24%; 
and lymphocyte count decreased, 24%. In the 102 patients who received treatment in Block 2, Grade ≥ 
3 events were reported in the same PTs with slightly increased frequencies: 66%, 63%, 56%, 53%, 25%, 
and 25%, respectively. The Grade ≥ 3 PTs reported most commonly in the 57 patients in Block 3 (during 
which Velcade was not administered) were consistent with those in Blocks 1 and 2 as follows: platelet 
count decreased, 74%; neutrophil count decreased, 68%; anemia, 65%; WBC count decreased, 61%; 
febrile neutropenia, 32%; and lymphocyte count decreased, 21%. The most marked change in frequency 
was observed in anemia, which increased from 41% in Block 1 to 53% in Block 2 to 65% in Block 3.

Compared to study AALL01P2 (in which the common chemotherapy backbone was employed, without the 
addition of Velcade), in study AALL07P1, the most commonly reported Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent 
adverse events by block were similar. There was a lower or similar incidence for the majority of Grade ≥3 
adverse events with Velcade, however higher incidences were noted in some blocks for infections, 
decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hypokalemia, and 
hyponatraemia.  
The majority of patients (126 of 140 patients; 90%) also experienced at least 1 Grade ≥ 4 TEAE, including 
41 of 47 patients (87%) in Stratum 1 and 52 of 57 patients (91%) in Stratum 2. The most commonly 
reported Grade ≥ 4 TEAEs by PTs in ≥ 10% of the safety population were platelet count decreased, 69%; 
neutrophil count decreased, 66%; WBC count decreased, 58%, lymphocyte count decreased, 24%; death 
in 24 patients (17%), and hypotension and hypokalemia, each in 11%. Grade ≥ 4 sepsis was reported 
with 10% incidence in the 104 patients in Strata 1 and 2 that included 4 patients (9%) in Stratum 1 and 
6 patients (11%) in Stratum 2. There were no reports of Grade % 4 PN events. 
Deaths 
A summary of deaths for all strata in the safety population is presented in Table below. 
In the safety population 67 of 140 patients (48%) died as of the data cut-off date. On-study deaths, those 
that occurred within 180 days of the last dose of study drug occurred in 41 patients (29%) that included 
16 of 47 patients (34%) in Stratum 1 and 16 of 57 patients (28%) in Stratum 2. Among the on-study 
deaths, the primary cause of death was attributed to disease in 28 patients (10 patients [21%] in Stratum 
1 and 10 patients [18%] in Stratum 2). Six deaths (4%) were considered related to study treatment, 
including 2 deaths (4%) in patients in Stratum 1, both of whom were also reported to have infections (soft 
tissue infection with persistent severe anemia in 1 patient and sepsis in the other) and 4 deaths (7%) in 
Stratum 2. Of these 4 deaths, 3 patients also experienced a respiratory event (respiratory failure, 
respiratory failure and septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], in 1 patient each); 
primary cause of death in the remaining patient was attributed to disease with investigator assessment 
that side effects of protocol therapy were a “major contribution to death.”

The incidence of deaths within 30 days of the last dose in study AALL07P1 (6%) was similar to that in 
study AALL01P2 (8%). Of these deaths, 50% were considered related to study treatment in both studies. 
Adverse events of interest  
Details of the Velcade-related TEAS of interest are shown in Table below: 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 31/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-Peripheral neuropathy: In Study AALL01P2, only peripheral neuropathy events Grade ≥3 were reported 
by COG and are available for comparison with events in Study AALL07P1. Although the incidences of 
peripheral neuropathy events were low in both studies (≤4% per block), the peripheral sensory 
neuropathy rate in Block 1 was 3% with the addition of Velcade compared with 0% in the backbone alone. 
Data on sequelae or resolution of PN events were not collected as part of this study. 
- Ileus: In Study AALL01P2 there were no Grade ≥3 events of ileus. In Study AALL07P1, 3 of 140 subjects 
(2.1%) experienced Grade ≥3 ileus, all reported in Block 1. The event of ileus was Grade 4 in 1 subject. 
- Pulmonary toxicities: The incidence of pulmonary toxicity events Grade ≥3 was low, and there were no 
clinically significant differences between Study AALL07P1 and Study AALL01P2. The incidence of hypoxia 
reported in Block 1 of therapy was 8% in Study AALL07P1 compared with 2% in Study AALL01P2. In 
Blocks 2 and 3, the incidences of hypoxia in these studies were 4% versus 6%, respectively, and 4% 
versus <1%, respectively. 
- Infections: The incidence of Grade ≥3 infections with neutropenia was similar between Study AALL07P1 
and Study AALL01P2, except in Block 2, where it was higher in Study AALL07P1. Incidences of infection 
with neutropenia in Study AALL07P1 versus Study AALL01P2 were 24% versus 19% in Block 1, 22% 
versus 11% in Block 2, and 35% versus 35% in Block 3, respectively. The incidences of febrile 
neutropenia in Study AALL07P1 versus Study AALL01P2 were 24% versus 40% in Block 1, 25% versus 
29% in Block 2, and 32% versus 44% in Block 3, respectively. Bacterial infections were the most common 
cause of deaths related to study treatment in both studies. 
4.4.3.  Discussion 
In the absence of direct comparison in study AALL07P1, the MAH provided safety results for the overall 
safety population (including pre-B-cell and T-cell ALL patients together with LL patients) and for 
paediatric pre-B-cell ALL patients (strata 1+2) separately. In order to highlight significant 
Velcade-related toxicity, the frequency of selected AEs was also compared between Velcade-containing 
study AALL07P1 and previous study AALL01P2, in which Velcade had not been employed. 
The addition of Velcade to a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen appears to be feasible, as it was already 
observed for the VcR-CAP combination in mantle cell lymphoma. This is further demonstrated by the low 
rate of Velcade dose modifications and dose delays registered in blocks 1 and 2. The vast majority of 
patients received in fact all the planned Velcade administrations both in block 1 (94% received all 4 
doses) and in block 2 (97% received all 3 doses). Most significantly, only 5 patients out of 140 
discontinued Velcade due to AEs. 
Identifying a Velcade-related AEs profile in the absence of direct comparison is not an easy task. Toxicity 
in ALL treatments is expected in fact to be significant, due to high-intensity chemotherapy and 
leukemia-related impairment of bone marrow function and immune system integrity. In fact, nearly all 
patients across all strata (96%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (TEAE), and 114 out of 
140 patients (81%) a grade ≥ 3 TEAE defined as at least possibly related to Velcade. A signal for some 
safety concerns in patients with relapsed T-cell ALL could be revealed by the higher rate of 
Velcade-related severe toxicity in this population (14/22; 64%) compared to both pre-B-cell ALL patients 
(31/104; 30%) and the overall safety population (50/140; 36%), yet low numbers in stratum 4 (n=22) 
prevent further speculation.  
The MAH states that no new safety concerns were identified when Velcade was added to a standard 
chemotherapy regimen in this paediatric population. Indeed, the analysis of safety data shows that the 
higher rates of TEAEs were found in the Investigations, Blood and lymphatic system disorders, Infections 
and infestations, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, General disorders and Gastro-intetstinal disorders 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/419238/2016  
Page 32/41 
 
 
 
 
SOCs. Moreover, the profiles of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs and Velcade-related TEAEs are similar. This is 
understandable and can be explained by the already mentioned impact of ALL on bone marrow and 
immune system function, and by the known gastro-intestinal effects of intensive chemotherapy and its  
detrimental consequences on performance status. As confirmation, the most commonly reported grade ≥ 
3 TEAEs by preferred term (PT), both Velcade-related and overall, were peripheral blood cytopenias (i.e. 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutrophil count decreased), febrile neutropenia and hypotension, all 
possible manifestation of disease or known side effects of both chemotherapy and Velcade (as also 
reported in the SmPC for the current approved indications). In particular, in the SOC Infections and 
infestations, only sepsis can be identified as recurrent PT, as expected in such high immune-compromised 
subjects as relapsed ALL patients. Furthermore, compared to study AALL01P2 in which Velcade was not 
administered, the incidence of most grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was similar. Even with respect to on-treatment 
deaths, no significant incidence differences between studies AALL07P1 (6%) and AALL01P2 (8%) can be 
observed.  
However, some signals of Velcade-related toxicity considered relevant to this paediatric population were 
nonetheless identified. Considering the possible off-label use of Velcade in paediatric patients with 
relapsed ALL, the MAH was requested to amend the proposed SmPC (section 5.1) to include further 
details regarding the identified safety concerns. In response to this request of supplementary 
information, the MAH submitted a revised SmPC in which all the available information on the safety issues 
identified in paediatric ALL patients treated with Velcade in study AALL07P1 (compared with study 
AALL01P2) were included (see Section 6 below). 
No additional concern is present, and all safety issues are considered resolved. 
4.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to comply with Article 
46 of the Paediatric Regulation with the inclusion of clinical data on the use of Velcade in combination with 
intensive re-induction therapy in children with relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and 
Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL) (added text in red).  
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Dosage adjustments for transplant eligible patients 
For VELCADE dosage adjustments, dose modification guidelines described for monotherapy should be 
followed for neuropathy refer to Table 1. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in children below 18 years of age have not been established (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.2). Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. No data are available. 
Comment 
The proposed changes in section 4.2 of the SmPC are endorsed.

Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with VELCADE 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell lymphoma (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use).

A Phase II, single arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s Oncology 
Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi agent re induction chemotherapy in 
paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
[ALL]  with  T-cell  ALL,  and  T-cell  lymphoblastic  lymphoma  [LL]).  An  effective  reinduction  multiagent 
chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. VELCADE was administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 
to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered drugs in Block 3. 
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 18 
months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free survival 
rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis (n = 33) the 
CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% (95% CI: 54, 85). 
The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 86) and the 4-month 
event  free  survival  rate  was  67%  (95%  CI:  42,  83).  The  reported  efficacy  data  are  considered 
inconclusive. 
There  were  140  patients with  ALL  or  LL  enrolled  and  evaluated  for  safety;  median  age  was  10  years 
(range  1  to  26).  No  new  safety  concerns  were  observed  when  VELCADE  was  added  to  the  standard 
pediatric  pre  B  cell  ALL  chemotherapy  backbone.  The  following  adverse  reactions  (Grade  ≥  3)  were 
observed  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  VELCADE  containing  treatment  regimen  as  compared  with  a 
historical control study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory 
neuropathy  (3%  versus  0%);  ileus  (2.1%  versus  0%);  hypoxia  (8%  versus  2%).  No  information  on 
possible  sequelae  or  rates  of  peripheral  neuropathy  resolution  were  available  in  this  study.  Higher 
incidences were also noted for infections with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 
22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 6% 
in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 4% versus 
0 in Block 2). 
Comment 
All the proposed changes in section 5.1 of the SmPC are endorsed. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Age 
The pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were characterized following twice weekly intravenous bolus 
administration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 pediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface area (BSA). Geometric mean (%CV) 
clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the 
elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics such 
as age, body weight and sex did not have clinically significant effects on bortezomib 
clearance. BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in 
adults.

Clinical aspects 
PK/PD 
1) In study AALL07P1 PK data were collected when Velcade was administered in combination with a 
multi-drug chemotherapy regimen usually employed in the treatment of paediatric relapsed ALL. 
However, results from this PK population analysis, although mentioned, were not reported. Considering 
the shortage of PK data regarding the use of bortezomib in combination with polichemotherapy in 
relapsed paediatric ALL, all the available PK data in this paediatric population should be submitted by the 
MAH for assessment, and relevant information (i.e. PK differences between paediatric age groups, 
comparisons with PK data in adults, doses producing similar product exposure as in adults) summarised 
in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Efficacy 
2) The text proposed by the MAH for the SmPC (section 5.1) states that efficacy data from study 
AALL07P1 “are considered inconclusive”. Even though it could be agreed that efficacy data from study 
AAL07P1 can be considered inconclusive, taking into account the possible off-label use of Velcade in this 
paediatric population, especially following the publication by Messinger et al. (Blood, 2012) of the results 
regarding the Velcade-including polychemotherapy re-induction regimen developed by the TACL 
consortium, and the ongoing research efforts (at least 2 studies are ongoing/planned in paediatric T-cell 
ALL), further efficacy details are considered useful. The proposed changes to section 5.1 of the SmPC 
should be integrated with all the available data on CR2 rates and EFS from study AALL07P1, especially 
with respect to patients in strata 1, 2 and 4. 
Safety 
3) The MAH highlighted that, in some blocks of treatment, higher incidences of infections with 
neutropenia (24% vs 18% in block1 and 22% vs 11% in block 2), increased ALT, hypokalaemia and 
hyponatraemia were observed in Velcade-including study AALL07P1 compared to Velcade-free study 
AALL01P2. These differences should be further detailed and summarised in section 5.1 (sub-section 
“Paediatric population”) of the proposed SmPC. 
4) Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a well known toxicity for both Vincristine and Velcade, and 
co-administration of these two agents was avoided in the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell 
lymphoma, due to non-acceptable rates of PN. Although grade ≥ 3 PN was low in both studies AALL01P2 
and AALL07P1, peripheral sensory neuropathy rate was 3% in block 1 in study AALL07P1, where 4 doses 
of Velcade were administered, compared with 0% in Velcade-free study AALL01P2. This observation 
should be reflected on section 5.1 of the proposed SmPC. Moreover,  no information on possible sequelae 
or rates of PN resolution was available in study AALL07P1, and considering the possible relevance in 
paediatric patients, this uncertainty due to lack of data should be reported in the proposed SmPC (also 
integrating information in section 5.1). 
5) No case of grade ≥3 ileus was observed in Velcade-free study AALL01P2, while severe (grade ≥3) ileus 
was reported in 3/140 (2.1%) patients treated with the Velcade-containing regimen. This information is 
considered relevant in a paediatric setting, and should be reported in section 5.1 of the proposed SmPC.

6) The possible occurrence of pulmonary toxicity with Velcade is well known and documented on the 
SmPC. In study AALL07P1, the incidence of hypoxia in treatment block 1 was 8% with Velcade compared 
to 2% in study AALL01P2 without Velcade. In block 2, even if slightly more cases of hypoxia were 
observed in Velcade-free study AALL01P2 (4% vs 6%), 3 out of 4 deaths observed in this treatment phase 
in study AALL07P1 were considered related to respiratory failure/distress, and only in 1 case concomitant 
sepsis was reported. The possibility of a higher respiratory toxicity with Velcade cannot be excluded, and 
this safety concern should be mentioned in the proposed SmPC (integrating section 5.1).

PK/PD 
Question 1 
In study AALL07P1 PK data were collected when Velcade was administered in combination 
with  a  multi-drug  chemotherapy  regimen  usually  employed  in  the  treatment  of  paediatric 
relapsed ALL. However, results from this PK population analysis, although mentioned, were 
not  reported.  Considering  the  shortage  of  PK  data  regarding  the  use  of  bortezomib  in 
combination  with  polichemotherapy  in  relapsed  paediatric  ALL,  all  the  available  PK  data  in 
this  paediatric  population  should  be  submitted  by  the  MAH  for  assessment,  and  relevant 
information (i.e. PK differences between paediatric age groups, comparisons with PK data in 
adults, doses producing similar product exposure as in adults) summarised in section 5.2 of 
the SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  requested  PK  population  analysis  from  study  AALL07P1  has  been  provided  by  the  MAH  (see  the 
updated Section 4.3). Section 5.2 of the SmPC was amended as follows: 
Age 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  bortezomib  were  characterized  following  twice  weekly  intravenous  bolus 
administration of 1.3 mg/m2 doses to 104 pediatric patients (2-16 years old) with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia  (ALL)  or  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML).  Based  on  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis, 
clearance  of  bortezomib  increased  with  increasing  body  surface  area  (BSA).  Geometric  mean  (%CV) 
clearance was 7.79 (25%) L/hr/m2, volume of distribution at steady-state was 834 (39%) L/m2, and the 
elimination half-life was 100 (44%) hours. After correcting for the BSA effect, other demographics such 
as  age,  body  weight  and  sex  did  not  have  clinically  significant  effects  on  bortezomib  clearance. 
BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  Population  PK  analysis  showed  that  the  PK  of  bortezomib  in  paediatric  patients  was  adequately 
described by a 3 compartment model. Clearance of bortezomib increased with increasing body surface 
area (BSA). However, BSA-normalized clearance was similar across age groups. These findings indicate 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

that BSA-scaled dosing of bortezomib is appropriate for the paediatric patient population over the 2-16 
years age range.  
Conclusion 
The changes made to the SmPC section 5.2 are endorsed. Issue solved. 
Efficacy 
Question 2 
The text proposed by the MAH for the SmPC (section 5.1) states that efficacy data from study 
AALL07P1 “are considered inconclusive”. Even though it could be agreed that efficacy data 
from  study  AAL07P1  can  be  considered  inconclusive,  taking  into  account  the  possible 
off-label use of Velcade in this paediatric population, especially following the publication by 
Messinger  et  al.  (Blood,  2012)  of  the  results  regarding  the  Velcade-including 
polychemotherapy re-induction regimen developed by the TACL consortium, and the ongoing 
research  efforts  (at  least  2  studies  are  ongoing/planned  in  paediatric  T-cell  ALL),  further 
efficacy  details  are  considered  useful.  The  proposed  changes  to  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC 
should be integrated with all the available data on CR2 rates and EFS from study AALL07P1, 
especially with respect to patients in strata 1, 2 and 4. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH amended the proposed SmPC as requested: 
“Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with VELCADE 
in  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric  population  in  multiple  myeloma  and  in  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
A Phase II, single-arm efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s Oncology 
Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi-agent re-induction chemotherapy in 
paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies ( pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
[ALL] 77%, 16% with T-cell ALL, and 7% T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective reinduction 
multiagent  chemotherapy  regimen  was  administered  in  3 blocks.  Block 1  included  vincristine, 
prednisone,  doxorubicin  and  pegaspargase;  Block 2  included  cyclophosphamide,  etoposide  and 
methotrexate;  Block 3  included  high  dose  cytosine  arabinoside  and  asparaginase.  VELCADE  was 
administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 as a bolus intravenous injection on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of Block 1 
and days 1, 4, and 8 of Block 2. VELCADE was administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 to avoid potential 
overlapping toxicities with coadministered drugs in Block 3. 
Complete response at the end of Block 1 was evaluated in a pre-specified subset of the first 60 evaluable 
patients enrolled in the study with first relapse of pre-B cell ALL ≤ 21 years and relapsed < 36 months 
from  diagnosis;  Stratum 1  included  patients  with  relapse  within  18 months  of  diagnosis  (n = 27)  and 
Stratum 2 included patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis (n = 33). In Stratum 1 the CR 
rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free survival rate was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In 
Stratum 2 the CR rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% 
(95% CI: 54, 85). The CR rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22; median [range] age 14 [3, 26] 
years) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 86 ) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83).”

Safety 
Question 3 
The MAH highlighted that, in some blocks of treatment, higher incidences of infections with 
neutropenia  (24%  vs  18%  in  block1  and  22%  vs  11%  in  block  2),  increased  ALT, 
hypokalaemia  and  hyponatraemia  were  observed  in  Velcade-including  study  AALL07P1 
compared to Velcade-free study AALL01P2. These differences should be further detailed and 
summarised in section 5.1 (sub-section “Paediatric population”) of the proposed SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH amended the proposed SmPC as requested: 
“There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age 10 years (range 
1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when VELCADE was added to the standard pediatric pre 
B  cell  ALL  chemotherapy  backbone  regimen  as  compared  with  a  historical  control  study  in  which  the 
backbone  regimen  was  given  alone.  Although  the  safety  data  arises  from  two  different  studies  with 
differing safety populations, the following comparative safety information is provided for reference. The 
following adverse reactions (Grade ≥  3) were observed at a higher incidence in the VELCADE containing 
treatment  regimen  in  Block  1  in  this  study  as  compared  with  the  backbone  regimen  of  the  historical 
control study: peripheral sensory neuropathy (3% versus 0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% 
versus  2%).  No  information  on  possible  sequelae  or  rates  of  peripheral  neuropathy  resolution  were 
available in this study. Higher incidences were also noted in some Blocks for infections with Grade ≥  3 
neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 22% versus 11% in Block 2), increased ALT (17% versus 
8%  in  Block  2),  hypokalaemia  (18%  versus  6%  in  Block  1  and  21%  versus  12%  in  Block  2)  and 
hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 4% versus 0 in Block 2).” 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
All the requested information were included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Conclusion 
The changes in section 5.1 of the SmPC are endorsed. Issue solved. 
Question 4 
Peripheral  neuropathy  (PN)  is  a  well  known  toxicity  for  both  Vincristine  and  Velcade,  and 
co-administration  of  these  two  agents  was  avoided  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
mantle cell lymphoma, due to non-acceptable rates of PN. Although grade ≥  3 PN was low in 
both studies AALL01P2 and AALL07P1, peripheral sensory neuropathy rate was 3% in block 1 
in  study  AALL07P1,  where  4  doses  of  Velcade  were  administered,  compared  with  0%  in 
Velcade-free  study  AALL01P2.  This  observation  should  be  reflected  on  section  5.1  of  the 
proposed SmPC. Moreover,  no information on possible sequelae or rates of PN resolution was 
available in study AALL07P1, and considering  the possible relevance in paediatric  patients, 
this  uncertainty  due  to  lack  of  data  should  be  reported  in  the  proposed  SmPC  (also

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
All the requested information were included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Conclusion 
The changes in section 5.1 of the SmPC are endorsed. Issue solved. 
Question 5  
No case of grade ≥ 3 ileus was observed in Velcade-free study AALL01P2, while severe (grade 
≥ 3)  ileus  was  reported  in  3/140  (2.1%)  patients  treated  with  the  Velcade-containing 
regimen.  This  information  is  considered  relevant  in  a  paediatric  setting,  and  should  be 
reported in section 5.1 of the proposed SmPC.

The MAH amended the proposed SmPC as requested (see question 3). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
All the requested information were included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Conclusion 
The changes in section 5.1 of the SmPC are endorsed. Issue solved. 
Question 6 
The possible occurrence of pulmonary toxicity with Velcade is well known and documented on 
the  SmPC.  In  study  AALL07P1,  the  incidence of  hypoxia  in  treatment  block  1  was  8%  with 
Velcade compared to 2% in study AALL01P2 without Velcade. In block 2, even if slightly more 
cases  of  hypoxia  were  observed  in  Velcade-free  study  AALL01P2  (4%  vs  6%),  3  out  of  4 
deaths  observed  in  this  treatment  phase  in  study  AALL07P1  were  considered  related  to 
respiratory  failure/distress,  and  only  in  1  case  concomitant  sepsis  was  reported.  The 
possibility of a higher respiratory toxicity with Velcade cannot be excluded, and this safety 
concern should be mentioned in the proposed SmPC (integrating section 5.1).

Further to EMA comments the above indicated wording for section 5.1 has been further modified (new 
text  in  red)  and  endorsed  by  the  rapporteur  and  the  MAH.  Final  wording  endorsed  at  the  end  of  the 
opinion is as reported below and in the updated section 4.6 of this AR: 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with VELCADE 
in all subsets of the paediatric population in multiple myeloma and in mantle cell lymphoma (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
A Phase II, single-arm activity, safety, and pharmacokinetic trial conducted by the Children’s Oncology 
Group assessed the activity of the addition of bortezomib to multi-agent re-induction chemotherapy in 
paediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
[ALL] with T-cell ALL, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma [LL]). An effective reinduction multiagent 
chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. VELCADE was administered only in Blocks 1 and 2 
to avoid potential overlapping toxicities with coadministered drugs in Block 3. 
Complete response (CR) was evaluated at the end of Block 1. In B-ALL patients with relapse within 
18 months of diagnosis (n = 27) the CR rate was 67% (95% CI: 46, 84); the 4-month event free survival rate 
was 44% (95% CI: 26, 62). In B-ALL patients with relapse 18-36 months from diagnosis (n = 33) the CR 
rate was 79% (95% CI: 61, 91) and the 4-month event free survival rate was 73% (95% CI: 54, 85). The CR 
rate in first-relapsed T-cell ALL patients (n = 22) was 68% (95% CI: 45, 86) and the 4-month event free 
survival rate was 67% (95% CI: 42, 83). The reported efficacy data are considered inconclusive (see section 
4.2). 
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety; median age was 10 years (range 
1 to 26). No new safety concerns were observed when VELCADE was added to the standard pediatric 
pre-B cell ALL chemotherapy backbone. The following adverse reactions (Grade ≥ 3) were observed at a 
higher incidence in the VELCADE containing treatment regimen as compared with a historical control 
study in which the backbone regimen was given alone: in Block 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy (3% versus 
0%); ileus (2.1% versus 0%); hypoxia (8% versus 2%). No information on possible sequelae or rates of 
peripheral neuropathy resolution were available in this study. Higher incidences were also noted for 
infections with Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (24% versus 19% in Block 1 and 22% versus 11% in Block 2), 
increased ALT (17% versus 8% in Block 2), hypokalaemia (18% versus 6% in Block 1 and 21% versus 12% 
in Block 2) and hyponatraemia (12% versus 5% in Block 1 and 4% versus 0 in Block 2).

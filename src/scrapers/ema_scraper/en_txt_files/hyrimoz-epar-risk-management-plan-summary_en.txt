Summary of the risk management plan for Hyrimoz (adalimumab)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to 
Humira. The RMP details important risks of Hyrimoz, how these risks can be minimized, 
and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  these  risks  and  uncertainties 
(missing information).
Hyrimoz SmPC and Hyrimoz Labelling and Package Leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hyrimoz should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Hyrimoz  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
the RMP for Hyrimoz.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Hyrimoz is authorized for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(Polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  and  Enthesitis-related  arthritis),  axial 
spondyloarthritis  (Ankylosing  spondylitis  and  Axial  spondyloarthritis  without 
radiographic evidence of AS), Psoriatic arthritis, Psoriasis, Paediatric plaque psoriasis, 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), Crohn’s disease, Paediatric Crohn’s disease, Ulcerative 
colitis, Uveitis, Paediatric uveitis, and Paediatric ulcerative colitis (see SmPC for the 
full  indication).  It  contains  adalimumab  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by 
subcutaneous injection.
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Hyrimoz can be found in 
the  respective  EPARs,  including  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA 
website, under the medicines’ webpages:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/hyrimoz
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimize  or 
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Hyrimoz together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about these risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;

 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
These  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization  measures 
mentioned  under  relevant  important  risks,  below.  In  addition  to  these  measures, 
information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and analyzed regularly, 
including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Hyrimoz is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Hyrimoz are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Hyrimoz. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet 
and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety 
of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on 
the long-term use of the medicine).

II B: Summary of important risks
The safety information in the proposed Product Information is aligned to the reference 
medicinal product.
Important identified risk: Serious infections
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Serious infections are listed in section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions and section 4.8 Undesirable 
effects of the Humira SmPC and considered to be an 
important identified risk of the reference product Humira. 
Serious infections are therefore considered as an 
important identified risk of Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to 
Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
Serious infections were reported in both adult and 
pediatric subjects treated with TNF inhibitors and across 
all indications. Patients concomitantly treated with other 
immunosuppressant medicines are at increased risk as 
well as a past medical history of serious infections, 
glucocorticoid dose, and older age (> 65 years). These 
are important independent predictors of serious infection 
risks in patients treated with TNF inhibitors. Patients with 
RA had a 2-fold increased adjusted risk of hospitalized 
infections compared to those without RA concluded from a 
retrospective cohort. Current prednisone use > 7.5 
mg/day, previous infections and previous hospitalized 
infections increased the risk of hospitalized infections as 
well as probably RA disease activity.
Routine risk minimization measures:
Guidance is provided in the following sections of the 
SmPC: 4.2 Posology and method of administration, 4.3 
Contraindications, 4.4 Special warnings and precautions

Important identified risk: Tuberculosis (TB)
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
TB is listed in section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions and section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the 
Humira SmPC and is considered to be an important 
identified risk of the reference product Humira. TB is 
therefore considered as an important identified risk of 
Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to Humira.

Important identified risk: Malignancies
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Malignancies (including lymphoma, HSTCL, leukemia, 
NMSC, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and other 
malignancies) are listed in section 4.4 Special warnings 
and precautions and section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the 
Humira SmPC and are considered to be an important 
identified risk of the reference product Humira. 
Malignancies are therefore considered as an important 
identified risk of Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Lymphoma
For Hodgkin lymphoma age at diagnosis is a strong risk 
factor for survival, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma gender 
with a higher survival rate in males.
The most commonly used prognostic system for Hodgkin 
lymphoma is the International Prognostic System, which 
uses the following factors: serum albumin less than 4 
g/dL, hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dL, male sex, age ≥45, 
stage IV disease, WBC count >15,000/µL, absolute 
lymphocyte count <600/µL or <8% of the total WBC 
count or both.
HSTCL
A moderate risk factor is immune-mediated disease, 
concomitant azathioprine, and possibly TNF inhibitor 
treatment.
Leukemia
General risk factors are gender and age. Men are more 
likely to develop CML, CLL and AML than women. The risk 
of most leukemias, with the exception of ALL, typically 
increases with age.
Genetics: For most leukemias there is no clear link. First 
degree relatives of CLL patients or identical twins of AML 
or ALL patients are at increased risk.
Lifestyle: Smoking cigarettes increase risks for AML.
Exposures: High-energy radiation, long term exposure to 
chemicals such as pesticides or industrial chemicals like 
benzene are considered a risk.
Previous treatment: Certain types of chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy for other cancers are considered 
leukemia risk factors.
NMSC
BCC: white skin type, male sex, sunlight exposure - 
patient geographic location affects the risk of developing 
skin cancer. A latency period of 20-50 years is typical 
between the time of ultraviolet damage and clinical onset 
of cancer, gene mutations, X-ray, immunosuppressed 
patients, previous non-melanoma skin cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma: Patient related risk factors are 
organ transplantation, hematologic malignancy, long-term 
immunosuppressive therapy, HIV infection or AIDS.
Merkel cell carcinoma
The following factors are associated with increased risks: 
Whites / fair skin, UV radiation, age, long-term 
immunosuppression (risk 15 times increased compared to 
general population), RA, autoimmune disorders, organ 
transplantation, HIV, arsenic exposure, Merkel cell 
polyomavirus.
Melanoma
Important tumor specific risk factors are depth of 
invasion, the presence or absence of ulceration, and the 
nodal status at diagnosis. Patient factors are white skin, 
age, sun exposure.
TNF seems to be a negative prognostic factor in 
melanoma surgery and correlates with chemotherapy 
resistance. However, high intra-tumor levels of TNF might 
be beneficial for immunotherapy.

Other malignancies
No specific risk groups or risk factors are known within 
the population of patients treated with adalimumab.

Important  identified  risk:  Demyelinating  disorders  (including  multiple 
sclerosis (MS), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and optic neuritis (ON))
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Demyelinating disorders are listed in section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions and section 4.8 Undesirable 
effects of the Humira SmPC and considered to be an 
important identified risk of the reference product Humira. 
Demyelinating disorders are therefore considered as an 
important identified risk of Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to 
Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
Potential risk factors may include subjects with pre-
existing or recent onset central demyelinating disorders.
MS: Genetic susceptibility and presumed non-genetic 
trigger such as viral infection or low vitamin D levels.
GBS: Preceding gastrointestinal infection, older age, and 
upper extremity muscle strengths.
ON: Young adults, female, Caucasian.
Routine risk minimization measures:
Guidance is provided in the following sections of the 
SmPC: 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, 
where recommendations are done to perform a neurologic 
evaluation in patients with non-infectious intermediate 
uveitis prior to the initiation, and 4.8 Undesirable effects.

Important  identified  risk:  BCG  disease  following  live  BCG  vaccination  in 
infants with in utero exposure to Hyrimoz 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
BCG disease following live BCG vaccination in infants with 
in utero exposure to Humira is considered to be an 
important identified risk of the reference product Humira 
and is therefore considered as an important identified risk 
of Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
Adalimumab treatment may be required to maintain 
disease stability for women during pregnancy. 
Adalimumab may cross the placenta, leading to in-utero 
exposure, impairing the development of the immune 
system. A prolonged half-life of adalimumab in infants 
may prolong this exposure, and hence lead to a 
compromised immunosystem.
Therefore, the risk is potentially related to the maternal 
dose of adalimumab and how late into the pregnancy 
adalimumab treatment continued. 
The practice for BCG vaccine of neonates also differs 
across countries depending on national guidelines and the 
risk of TB exposure for the infant.
Routine risk minimization measures:
Guidance is provided in the following sections of the 
SmPC: 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use; and 
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
PL sections 2
Legal status: Prescription only
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk: Administration of 
live vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to 
adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months 
following the mother’s last adalimumab injection during 
pregnancy.

Important potential risk: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
PML mainly occurs in immunocompromised individuals, 
and isolated cases were described in association with 
biologic therapy. PML is considered to be an important 
potential risk of the reference product Humira and is 
therefore considered as an important potential risk of 
Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
The development of PML has been most extensively 
studied with natalizumab (1.78 per 1000 for patients 
treated more than 2 years). 
Contributors to the risk to develop PML under 
natalizumab, rituximab or efalizumab and possibly also 
infliximab are the combined application and sequential 
application of immunomodulatory/ immunosuppressive 
compounds and the duration and exposure of treatment.

Important  potential  risk:  Reversible  posterior 
syndrome (RPLS)
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
RPLS mainly occurs in immunocompromised individuals, 
and isolated cases were described in association with 
biologic therapy. RPLS considered to be an important 
potential risk of the reference product Humira and is 
therefore considered as an important potential risk of 
Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to Humira.

Important potential risk: Adenocarcinoma of colon in ulcerative colitis (UC) 
patients
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
It is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the 
risk for adenocarcinoma of the colon. Adenocarcinoma of 
colon in UC patients is considered to be an important 
potential risk of the reference product Humira and is 
therefore considered to be an important potential risk of 
Hyrimoz, a biosimilar to Humira.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
Risk factors for colorectal cancer in UC patients include 
young age at diagnosis, longer duration, greater 
anatomical extent of colonic involvement, the degree of 
inflammation, family history of colorectal cancer, and 
presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Routine risk minimization measures:
Guidance is provided in the section 4.4 Special warnings 
and precautions for use of the SmPC, where it is 
recommended that all patients with UC who are at 
increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for 
example, patients with long-standing UC or primary 
sclerosing cholangitis), or who had a prior history of 
dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for 
dysplasia at regular intervals before therapy and 
throughout their disease course.

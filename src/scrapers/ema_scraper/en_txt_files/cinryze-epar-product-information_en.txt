UTransmissible agents
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from 
human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded.
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and 
for the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19.
Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular/repeated
receipt of human plasma-derived C1-esterase inhibitor product.
UHypersensitivity
As with any biological product hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Hypersensitivity reactions may 
have symptoms similar to angioedema attacks. Patients should be informed of the early signs of 
hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, 
hypotension and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur after administration, they should alert their 
4
physician. In case of anaphylactic reactions or shock, emergency medical treatment should be 
administered.
UHome-treatment and self-administration
There are limited data on the use of this medicinal product in home- or self-administration. Potential 
risks associated with home-treatment are related to the administration itself as well as the handling of 
adverse reactions, particularly hypersensitivity. The decision on the use of home- treatment for an 
individual patient should be made by the treating physician, who should ensure that appropriate 
training is provided, and the use reviewed at intervals.
UPaediatric population
Thrombotic events have been reported in neonatal and infant subjects undergoing cardiac bypass 
procedures while receiving off-label high doses of another C1-esterase inhibitor product (up to 
500 UnitsP
P/kg) to prevent capillary leak syndrome.
()
USodium
This medicinal product contains 11.5 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
UPregnancy
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of Human C1-esterase
inhibitor on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn child. To date, no other relevant 
epidemiological data are available. No maternal or embryofoetal effects of treatment were observed in 
reproductive studies in rats at dose levels up to 28-times the recommended human dose (1000 IU)
based on an average adult body weight of 70 kg. The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Therefore, Cinryze should be given to pregnant women only if clearly indicated.
UBreast-feeding
It is unknown whether Human C1-esterase inhibitor is excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from Cinryze therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
UFertility
No specific studies on fertility, early embryonic and postnatal development, or carcinogenicity studies 
were conducted (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Based upon the clinical data currently available, Cinryze has minor influence on the ability to drive 
and use machines.

4.8 Undesirable effects
USummary of the safety profile
The very common adverse reactions observed following Cinryze infusion in clinical studies were 
headache and nausea.
UTabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reaction frequencies were estimated from 2 pivotal placebo-controlled and 2 open-label
studies in 251 unique subjects. Only frequencies based on reporting rates from clinical trials are used 
to assign frequency category.
Adverse reactions to treatment with Cinryze are classified by MedDRA System Organ Class and 
absolute frequency in Table 1. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in 
order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to
<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

UDescription of selected adverse reactions
Among reports of venous thrombosis, the most common underlying risk factor was presence of an 
indwelling catheter.

Local reactions at the injection site were uncommon. In clinical studies local reactions (described as 
pain, bruising, or rash at the injection/catheter site, venous burning or phlebitis) occurred in 
association with approximately 0.2% of infusions.
UPaediatric population
Across clinical studies, there were 61 unique paediatric subjects enrolled and exposed to over 
2,500 infusions of Cinryze (2-5 years, n=3; 6-11 years, n=32; 12-17 years, n=26). Among these 
children, the only adverse reactions with Cinryze included headache, nausea, pyrexia, and infusion site 
erythema. None of these adverse reactions were severe, and none led to discontinuation of medicinal 
product.
Overall, the safety and tolerability of Cinryze are similar in children, adolescents and adults.
For safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.
UReporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in hereditary angioedema, C1-esterase inhibitor, plasma 
derived, ATC code: B06AC01.
UMechanism of action
C1-esterase inhibitor is a member of the serine protease inhibitor, or serpin, superfamily of proteins. 
The main function of serpins is to regulate the activity of serine proteases. C1-esterase inhibitor is a 
single chain glycoprotein found in plasma which, in its mature state, consists of 478 amino acids with 
an apparent molecular weight of 105 kD.
C1-esterase inhibitor inhibits the complement system by binding C1r and C1s, two of the active 
enzyme subunits of the first component of the complement system (C1) in the classical pathway, as 
well as to mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases in the lectin pathway. The primary 
substrate of the activated C1 enzyme is C4; uninhibited C1 results in diminished C4 levels. C1 is the 
most important inhibitor of contact activation and regulates the contact system and the intrinsic 
coagulation pathway by binding to and inactivating kallikrein and factor XIIa. Because these pathways 
are part of enzyme amplification cascades, without C1-esterase inhibitor, spontaneous or 
trigger-induced activation of these pathways can lead to unopposed activation and swelling.
UPharmacodynamic effects
In clinical studies, the intravenous administration of Cinryze resulted in a significant increase in 
systemic levels of antigenic and functional C1-esterase inhibitor within 1 hour after administration. 
Administration of C1-esterase inhibitor increases serum levels of C1-esterase inhibitor activity and 
temporarily restores the natural regulation of the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems 
thereby controlling the swelling or the propensity to swell.
7
Low serum C4 levels often correlate with HAE attacks. Treatment with Cinryze resulted in elevation 
of C4 levels at 12 hours. There was a statistically significant (p=0.0017) difference in the changes in 
mean values from baseline between treatment groups at 12 hours, demonstrating the association of 
Cinryze treatment with an increase in C4 activity (Cinryze + 2.9 mg/dl versus placebo + 0.1 mg/dl).
UClinical efficacy and safety
Data from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (LEVP 2005-1/A and 
LEVP 2005-1/B), data from two open-label studies (LEVP 2006-1 and LEVP 2006-4) and 2 paediatric 
clinical studies (0624-203 and 0624-301) demonstrated the efficacy of Cinryze for the treatment and 
prevention of angioedema attacks in subjects with HAE.
Cinryze for the treatment of HAE attacks
Study LEVP 2005-1/A used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design; 
71 subjects with acute HAE attacks were randomised (36 Cinryze, 35 placebo). The study 
demonstrated that treatment with Cinryze within 4 hours after the onset of an HAE attack resulted in a 
greater than 2-fold decrease in the time to beginning of unequivocal relief of the defining symptom of 
the HAE attack compared to placebo (median 2 hours for Cinryze vs. >4 hours for placebo, p=0.048). 
Treatment with Cinryze also resulted in a greater than 2-fold decrease in the time to complete 
resolution of the HAE attack compared to placebo (median 12.3 hours vs. 31.6 hours, p=0.001). 
The percentage of subjects with beginning of unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within
4 hours after dosing was 60% for Cinryze and 42% for placebo (p=0.062). Among 15 subjects treated 
with open-label Cinryze for laryngeal HAE attacks, none required intubation.
In open-label study LEVP 2006-1, 101 subjects were treated for a total of 609 acute HAE attacks
(median 3 attacks per subject; range: 1-57). Within 4 hours after Cinryze dosing, 87% of attacks 
achieved unequivocal relief of the defining symptom. For 95% of attacks, clinical relief was observed
and/or subjects were discharged to home within 4 hours. For subjects with >1 attack, the proportion of 
attacks responding within 4 hours after Cinryze dosing and the time to response was comparable 
regardless of the number of attacks treated. Among 84 separate laryngeal HAE attacks, none required 
intubation following treatment with Cinryze.
Cinryze for the routine prevention of HAE attacks
Study LEVP 2005-1/B used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design; 
22 subjects were evaluable for efficacy (randomised and treated in both crossover periods). The study 
demonstrated that prophylaxis with Cinryze resulted in a greater than 2-fold reduction in the number 
of HAE attacks compared to placebo (mean 6.3 attacks for Cinryze vs. 12.8 attacks for placebo, 
p<0.0001). Angioedema attacks were also less severe during prophylactic Cinryze therapy compared 
to placebo (mean severity score 1.3 vs. 1.9 or a 32% reduction, p=0.0008) and of shorter duration 
(mean 2.1 days vs. 3.4 days or a 38% reduction, p=0.0004). The total number of days of swelling 
during prophylactic Cinryze therapy was reduced compared to placebo (mean 10.1 days vs. 29.6 days 
or a 66% reduction, p<0.0001). In addition, fewer open-label Cinryze infusions were required for 
treatment of HAE attacks during therapy with Cinryze compared to placebo (mean 4.7 infusions vs. 
15.4 infusions or 70% reduction, p<0.0001).
In open-label study LEVP 2006-4, 146 subjects received Cinryze as HAE prophylaxis for periods 
ranging from 8 days to approximately 32 months (median 8 months). Prior to enrollment, subjects 
reported a median monthly HAE attack rate of 3.0 (range: 0.08-28.0); during therapy with 
prophylactic Cinryze, this rate was 0.21 (range: 0-4.56), and 86% of subjects experienced an average 
of ≤1 attack per month. For subjects receiving Cinryze prophylaxis for at least 1 year, the monthly 
attack rate per subject remained consistently low (0.34 attacks per month) relative to pre-study rates.
8
Cinryze for the pre-procedure prevention of HAE attacks
Open-label Cinryze was administered within 24 hours prior to a total of 91 medical, dental, or surgical 
procedures across the clinical programme (40 procedures in children and 51 procedures in adults).
For 98% of procedures, no HAE attacks were reported within the 72 hours after the Cinryze dose.
UPaediatric population (age-group 6-11 years)
Cinryze for the treatment of HAE attacks
Study LEVP 2006-1: Twenty-two paediatric subjects were treated for 121 acute HAE attacks. The 
proportion of HAE attacks achieving unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours after 
Cinryze treatment was comparable between the 22 children enrolled (age range: 2-17) and adults, with 
89% and 86% of attacks achieving relief, respectively.

*Historically assigned potency values are expressed in in-house Units (U).
After intravenous administration of a single dose of Cinryze to HAE subjects, the serum concentration 
of functional C1-esterase inhibitor doubled within 1 to 2 hours. The maximum serum concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) appeared to increase from the single 
to double dose, although the increase was not dose-proportional. The mean elimination half-life of 
functional C1-esterase inhibitor after administration of Cinryze was 56 hours for a single dose and 
62 hours for the double dose.
Because C1-esterase inhibitor is an endogenous human plasma protein, it is not subject to metabolism 
by Cytochrome P450 iso-enzymes, excretion, or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions exhibited by 
many low molecular weight compounds. The expected consequence of metabolism of a glycoprotein 
is via degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. As such, the pharmacokinetics and 
excretion of Cinryze are not expected to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment.
UPaediatric population
Functional C1-esterase inhibitor activity was measured in children in the two open label studies (see 
section 5.1). Mean increases from baseline in functional C1-esterase inhibitor activity measured 1 hour 
post-dose in children 2 to <18 years of age ranged from 20% to 88% in Study LEVP 2006-1 
(treatment) and from 22% to 46% in Study LEVP 2006-4 (prevention) compared with 21% to 66% 
and 25% to 32% in adults, respectively. Two additional studies evaluated plasma levels in children (6-
11 years).

Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of general 
toxicity and toxicity to reproduction. No genotoxicity studies were performed as the active substance
is unlikely to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. No studies on fertility, early 
embryonic and post-natal development, or carcinogenicity studies were conducted because chronic 
dosing in animals would be expected to be associated with development of neutralising antibodies to 
the human protein.

Aseptic technique should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Ensure the powder vial and the solvent vial are at room temperature (15ºC - 25ºC).
Release the powder vial label by tearing down the perforated strip indicated by the inverted 
triangle.
Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials.
Cleanse stoppers with a disinfection swab and allow them to dry prior to use.
Remove protective covering from the top of the transfer device package. Do not remove the 
device from the package.
Note: the transfer device must be attached to the solvent vial before being attached to the 
powder vial, so that the vacuum in the powder vial is not lost. Place the solvent vial on a flat 
surface and insert the blue end of the transfer device into the solvent vial, pushing down until 
the spike penetrates through the centre of the solvent vial stopper and the device snaps in place. 
The transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure.
Remove the plastic package from the transfer device and discard it. Take care not to touch the 
exposed end of the transfer device.
Place the powder vial on a flat surface. Invert the transfer device and the solvent vial containing 
water for injections and insert the clear end of the transfer device into the powder vial, pushing 
down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and the transfer device snaps into place. The 
transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure of the powder vial. The

vacuum in the powder vial will draw in the solvent. If there is no vacuum in the vial, do not use 
the product.
11. Gently swirl the powder vial until all powder is dissolved. Do not shake the
powder vial. Make sure all the powder is completely dissolved.
12. Disconnect the solvent vial by turning it anti-clockwise. Do not remove the clear end of the 
transfer device from the powder vial.
One vial of reconstituted Cinryze contains 500 IU of Human C1-esterase inhibitor in 5 ml, resulting in 
a concentration of 100 IU/ml. Proceed to administration process if patients receive a dose of 500 IU.
Two vials of Cinryze powder must be reconstituted to make one dose (1000 IU/10 ml). Therefore,
repeat instructions 1 to 12 above using an additional package containing a transfer device to 
reconstitute the second of two powder vials. Do not reuse the transfer device. Once the two vials are 
reconstituted proceed to administration process for a dose of 1000 IU

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Cinryze is and what it is used for
Cinryze contains the human protein called “C1-esterase inhibitor” as the active substance.
C1-esterase inhibitor is a naturally occurring protein that is normally present in the blood. If you have 
a low amount of C1-esterase inhibitor in your blood or your C1-esterase inhibitor is not working 
properly, this can lead to swelling attacks (called angioedema). Symptoms may include stomach pains 
and swelling of the:
hands and feet

face, eyelids, lips or tongue

voice-box (larynx), which may make breathing difficult

genitals

In adults and children, Cinryze can raise the amount of C1-esterase inhibitor in the blood and either 
prevent (prior to undergoing medical or dental procedures) these swelling attacks from occurring or 
stop swelling attacks once they have begun.
In adults, adolescents and children (aged 6 years and above), Cinryze can raise the amount of C1-
esterase inhibitor in the blood and routinely prevent swelling attacks from occurring.
2. What you need to know before you take Cinryze
Do not take Cinryze

If you are allergic to Human C1-esterase inhibitor or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). It is important to tell your doctor if you think you have ever had 
an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in Cinryze.
27
Warnings and precautions
 Before you start treatment with Cinryze, it is important that you tell your doctor if you have, or 
have had, problems with your blood clotting (thrombotic events). You will be carefully monitored 
if this is the case.
If you begin to suffer from rashes, tightness of the chest, wheezing, or a fast heart beat once you 
have taken Cinryze, you should tell your doctor immediately (see section 4).

 When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to 
prevent infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma 
donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each 
donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also 
include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. 
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, 
the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any 
unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.
 The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, and for the non-enveloped 
hepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses.
 Your doctor may recommend that you consider having vaccinations against hepatitis A and B if 
you regularly or repeatedly receive Human C1-esterase inhibitor products that have been taken 
from human plasma.
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded by your nurse or doctor.

Children
Cinryze is not for use in children below 6 years of age for routine prevention of angioedema attacks.
Other medicines and Cinryze
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking Cinryze. There is limited information on the safety of Cinryze use 
during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss with you the risks and benefits of 
taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Cinryze has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Cinryze contains sodium
This medicine contains 11.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.5% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
3.
How to take Cinryze
Your treatment will be initiated and managed under supervision of a doctor experienced in the care of 
patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE).
A doctor or nurse may prepare and inject Cinryze for you. If your doctor decides you can self-
administer, your doctor or nurse will train you or a family member to prepare and inject Cinryze. Your 
28
doctor will regularly review the preparation and administration process with you or a family member
or carer.
The recommended dose of Cinryze for adults, adolescents, children, the elderly, or patients suffering 
from kidney or liver problems is as follows:

Reconstitution and method of administration
Cinryze is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or your carer 
might also administer Cinryze as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. If you are 
injecting Cinryze yourself, always use it exactly as your doctor has instructed you. Check with your 
doctor if you are not sure. If your doctor decides that you may be suitable for such home-treatment, 
he/she will give you detailed instructions. You will be required to keep a diary in order to document 
each treatment received at home and to bring it to each of your visits to the doctor. Regular review of 
your/your carer’s injection technique will be performed to ensure continued appropriate handling.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Reconstitution and administration of Cinryze
Reconstitution, product administration and handling of the administration set and needles must be 
done with caution. 
Use either the filter transfer device provided with Cinryze or a commercially available double-ended 
needle. 
Only use a silicone-free syringe (provided in the pack) for administration of the product.
Preparation and handling
Cinryze is intended for intravenous administration (into the vein) after reconstitution with water for 
injections.
Cinryze vial is for single use only.
Reconstitution
For a dose of 500 IU: One powder vial, 1 solvent vial, 1 filter transfer device, 1 disposable 10 ml 
syringe, 1 venipuncture set and 1 protective mat are needed. Store the remaining vial and 
administration equipments for the next dose.
For a dose of 1000 IU: Two powder vials, 2 solvent vials, 2 filter transfer devices, 1 disposable 10 ml 
syringe, 1 venipuncture set and 1 protective mat are needed.
Each product vial should be reconstituted with 5 ml water for injections.
One vial of reconstituted Cinryze corresponds to a dose of 500 IU. Therefore only reconstitute one vial 
of Cinryze for one dose of 500 IU.
Two vials of reconstituted Cinryze correspond to a dose of 1000 IU. Therefore two vials are combined 
for one dose of 1000 IU.
1. Work on the mat provided and wash your hands before performing the following procedures.
2.
3.
4.
Aseptic technique should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Ensure the powder vial and the solvent vial are at room temperature (15ºC - 25ºC).
Release the powder vial label by tearing down the perforated strip indicated by the inverted 
triangle.
Remove plastic caps from the powder and solvent vials. 
Cleanse stoppers with a disinfection swab and allow them to dry prior to use.
Remove protective covering from the top of the transfer device package. Do not remove the
device from the package.
5.
6.
7.
8.
Note: the transfer device must be attached to the solvent vial before being attached to the 
powder vial, so that the vacuum in the powder vial is not lost. Place the solvent vial on a flat 
surface and insert the blue end of the transfer device into the solvent vial, pushing down until 
34
the spike penetrates through the centre of the solvent vial stopper and the device snaps in place. 
The transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure.
9.
Remove the plastic package from the transfer device and discard it. Take care not to touch the 
exposed end of the transfer device.
10.
Place the powder vial on a flat surface. Invert the transfer device and the solvent vial containing 
water for injections and insert the clear end of the transfer device into the powder vial, pushing 
down until the spike penetrates the rubber stopper and the transfer device snaps into place. 
The transfer device must be vertical prior to penetrating the stopper closure of the powder vial. 
The vacuum in the powder vial will draw in the solvent. If there is no vacuum in the vial, do not 
use the product.
11. Gently swirl the powder vial until all powder is dissolved. Do not shake the
powder vial. Make sure all the powder is completely dissolved.
35
12. Disconnect the solvent vial by turning it anti-clockwise. Do not remove the clear end of the 
transfer device from the powder vial.
One vial of reconstituted Cinryze contains 500 IU of Human C1-esterase inhibitor in 5 ml, 
resulting in a concentration of 100 IU/ml. Proceed to administration process if patients receive a 
dose of 500 IU.
Two vials of Cinryze powder must be reconstituted to make one dose (1000 IU/10 ml). Therefore 
repeat instructions 1 to 12 above using an additional package containing a transfer device to 
reconstitute the second of two powder vials. Do not reuse the transfer device. Once the two vials are 
reconstituted proceed to administration process for a dose of 1000 IU.
Administration process for a dose of 500 IU
1.
2.
3.
Aseptic technique should be used during the administration procedure.
After reconstitution, the Cinryze solutions are colourless to slightly blue and clear. Do not use 
the product if the solutions are turbid or discoloured.
Using a sterile, disposable 10 ml syringe, draw back the plunger to allow approximately 5 ml of 
air into the syringe.
4.
Attach the syringe onto the top of the clear end of the transfer device by turning it clockwise.
36
5.
Invert the vial gently and inject air into the solution and then slowly withdraw the reconstituted 
Cinryze solution into the syringe. 
6.
Detach the syringe from the vial by turning it anti-clockwise and releasing it from the clear end 
of the transfer device.
7.
8.
Inspect the reconstituted Cinryze solution for particulate matter prior to administration; do not 
use if particles are observed.
Attach the venipuncture set to the syringe containing Cinryze solution and inject intravenously 
(into the vein) into the patient. Administer 500 IU (reconstituted in 5 ml of water for injections) 
of Cinryze by intravenous injection at a rate of 1 ml per minute over 5 minutes.

Using the same syringe, repeat steps 3 to 6 with a second vial of reconstituted Cinryze to make 
one complete 10 ml dose.
Inspect the reconstituted Cinryze solution for particulate matter prior to administration; do not 
use if particles are observed.
Attach the venipuncture set to the syringe containing Cinryze solution and inject intravenously 
(into the vein) into the patient. Administer 1000 IU (reconstituted in 10 ml of water for 
injections) of Cinryze by intravenous injection (into the vein) at a rate of 1 ml per minute over 
10 minutes. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

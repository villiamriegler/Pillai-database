2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for Study MLN0002/CCT-001, a phase 3 study of vedolizumab 
300 mg (powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) in CD conducted in Japan. This study is not 
part of the vedolizumab Paediatic Investigational Plan (PIP) in UC and CD, EMEA-000645-PIP01-09.   
Study MLN0002/CCT-001 in CD is part of the phase 3 clinical program to support registration in Japan, 
along  with  study  MLN0002/CCT-101  which  is  a  phase  3  study  of  vedolizumab  300  mg  (powder  for 
concentrate for solution for infusion) in UC.  
Clinical study 
Study MLN0002/CCT-001  
Description 
A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous MLN0002 (300 mg) infusion in induction and 
maintenance therapy in Japanese subjects (from 15 to 80 years) with moderate or severe CD. 
Methods 
Objectives: 
Primary Objective for the Induction Phase: To evaluate efficacy  
Secondary Objective for the Induction Phase: To evaluate safety  
Primary Objective for the Maintenance Phase: To evaluate efficacy  
Secondary Objective for the Maintenance Phase: To evaluate safety  
Study design 
This study consisted of the screening phase, the induction phase, the maintenance phase, and an 
open-label phase.

Subjects enrolled into the induction phase were randomized 1:1 to placebo or MLN0002 and received 
placebo or 300 mg of MLN0002 at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 in a double-blinded manner. Primary efficacy 
evaluation in the induction phase was performed at Week 10.  
Subjects showing Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) -70 response at Week 10 were enrolled into the 
maintenance phase at Week 14. Subjects who received the placebo in the induction phase continued to 
receive  the  placebo  at  Weeks  14,  22,  30,  38,  46,  and  54  in  a  double-blinded  manner.  Subjects  who 
received MLN0002 in the induction phase were randomized 1:1 to the placebo or MLN0002 and received 
the placebo or 300 mg of MLN0002 at Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, and 54 in a double-blinded manner. 
The primary efficacy evaluation in the maintenance phase was performed at Week 60.  
Subject not showing CDAI-70 response at Week 10 were allowed to be enrolled into the open-label cohort 
at Week 10. In addition, subjects who experienced disease worsening or received rescue medications 
during the maintenance phase, or subjects who completed Week 60 of the maintenance phase were also 
allowed to be enrolled into the open-label cohort. The day individual subject was enrolled into the open-
label cohort was defined as Week 0x, and the subject received 300 mg of MLN0002 at Weeks 0x, 2x, 
and 6x followed by doses every 8 weeks up to Week 46x (minimum) or Week 94x (maximum) in an un-
blinded manner. Administration of MLN0002 was to be terminated in all subjects at Week 46x of the last 
subject enrolled into the open-label cohort. 
The end-of-study examination was performed at 16 weeks after the last dose in all subjects who received 
the study drug. In addition, the follow-up survey was to be performed every 6 months from the last dose 
of the study drug, for up to 2 years thereafter or until the marketing approval date of the study drug, 
whichever comes earlier.

Study population /Sample size 
Study MLN0002/CCT-001 enrolled a total of 157 subjects in the induction phase, of these only 6 were 
aged 15 to 18 years at entry (1 was 15 years old, 2 were 16 years old and 3 were 17 years old): 1 was 
randomized  in vedolizumab and 5 in placebo arm. Subjects enrolled in the maintenance phase were 41 
and subjects enrolled in the open-label cohort were 134. 
Treatments 
Subjects  in  induction  phase  were  randomized  1:1  in  a  double-blinded  manner  to  receive  placebo  or 
vedolizumab  300  mg  at  Weeks  0,  2,  and  6.  Subjects  not  responder  at  Week  10  of  induction  phase, 
subjects  who  experienced  disease  worsening  or  received  rescue  medications  during  the  maintenance 
phase, or subjects who completed Week 60 of the maintenance phase were enrolled in open-label Cohort 
to receive vedolizumab 300 mg at Weeks 0x to 94x in an unblinded manner. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Induction Phase 
Primary Endpoint 
-  CDAI-100 response at Week 10 
Secondary Endpoints 
-  Clinical remission at Week 10 
-  Change in CRP level over time in the subpopulation of subjects with the baseline CRP level of 
>0.30 mg/dL 
Maintenance Phase 
Primary Endpoint 
-  Clinical remission at Week 60 
Secondary Endpoints 
-  CDAI-100 response at Week 60 
-  Durable remission in the maintenance phase 
-  Corticosteroid-free remission at Week 60 
Statistical Methods 
“Full Analysis Set in induction phase,” a primary population for the efficacy analysis in the 
induction phase, was defined as subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
the study drug in the induction phase. 
The superiority of MLN0002 over the placebo on CDAI-100 response at Week 10 in the primary analysis 
of the induction phase was demonstrated when a statistically significant difference was observed between 
the treatment groups.  
For the other efficacy analysis (e.g. CDAI-100 response at Week 60, durable response in the maintenance 
phase  and  corticosteroid-free  remission  at  Week  60)  were  summarized  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
primary analysis in the induction phase.

• Confidence coefficient (CI): 95% (two-sided estimation) 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  157  subjects  entered  into  the  induction  phase  at  60  sites  in  Japan;  these  subjects  were 
randomized to the placebo group (78 subjects) or the MLN0002 group (79 subjects), and received the 
study drug in a double-blinded manner. A total of 139 subjects (88.5%) completed the planned infusions 
of the study drug in the induction phase and 18 subjects (11.5%) prematurely discontinued the study 
drug. The reasons for study drug discontinuation were AE in 14 subjects, lack of efficacy in 2 subjects, 
and voluntary withdrawal in 2 subjects. 
Baseline data 
In overall subjects who entered in the induction phase, the proportion of male subjects was 65.6%. The 
overall mean age was 33.3 years, the majority (61.1%) was less than 35 years, and 2 subjects (1.3%) 
were ≥65 years of age. 
The mean duration of CD was 9.03 years, and the mean CDAI score was 299.5 at Baseline (Week 0). 
No marked differences were observed between treatment groups in Baseline CD characteristics. 
In  the  category  of  “worst  prior  treatment  failures,”  prior  TNF α   antagonist  failure,  prior 
immunomodulators  failure  (excluding  TNFα  antagonist  failure),  and  prior  corticosteroids  failure  only 
were categorized by 121 subjects (77.1%), 21 subjects (13.4%), and 15 subjects (9.6%), respectively. 
The study was projected to have subjects without prior TNFα antagonist use accounting for 25% of the 
planed sample size. As a result, 21.7% (34/157) of subjects who entered in the induction phase had no 
prior TNFα antagonist use.

Summary of change from baseline in CRP level by visit (Full Analysis Set in Induction Phase) 
Paediatric subset  
6 subjects were aged 15 to 18 years at entry (1 was 15 years old, 2 were 16 years old and 3 were 
17 years old): 1 in vedolizumab and 5 in placebo for CD in induction phase. Two subjects in the placebo 
group had response in the induction phase and thus continued on placebo in the maintenance phase. 
The other 4 subjects (1 in vedolizumab and 3 in placebo) had no response in the induction phase. All 6 
subjects continued into the open-label extension cohort. 
The study did not stratify by age and no subgroup analysis was planned or conducted for subjects aged 
15 to 18 years. 
Induction Phase Immunogenicity Results: 
A  total  of  1  subject  (1.6%)  in  the  MLN0002  group  was  AVA  positive  at  any  time  points  during  the 
induction phase, and the subject was positive for both AVA and neutralizing antibodies at Week 10. No 
infusion reactions occurred in this subject. 
Additionally, another 1 subject (1.6%) was AVA positive at Baseline (Week 0) before administration of 
the study drug, and no infusion reactions occurred in this subject.

Paediatric subset: Two subjects in the placebo group had response in the induction phase and thus 
continued on placebo in the maintenance phase. 
Open-Label Cohort 
Of  the  157  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug  in  the  induction  phase  or  the 
maintenance phase, 134 subjects (85.4%) entered into the open-label cohort, and all of them received 
MLN0002 in the open-label cohort. Of the 134 subjects, a total of 77 subjects (57.5%) discontinued the 
study  drug  in  the  open-label  cohort.  The  reasons  for  study  drug  discontinuation  were  PTE/AE  in  43 
subjects, lack of efficacy in 23 subjects, voluntary withdrawal in 7 subjects, lost to follow-up in 1 subject, 
pregnancy in 1 subject and other in 2 subjects. 
All the 134 subjects who entered in the open-label cohort received at least one dose of study drug in the 
open-label cohort and were included in the “Full Analysis Set in open-label cohort” and “Safety Analysis 
Set in open-label cohort.” 
Paediatric  subset:  all  the  six  subjects  aged  15  to  18  years  continued  into  the  open-label  extension 
cohort. 
At Week 94x (LOCF), mean CDAI score was 230.4 and mean change from Baseline in CDAI score was -
63.6 points. The mean CDAI score decreased from Week 0x to Week 46x, and thereafter was generally 
unchanged. 
Overall, the effect of MLN0002 was sustained up to Week 94x. 
Of 109 subjects who underwent proper AVA/neutralizing AVA test out of the “Full Analysis Set in open-
label  cohort,”  4  subjects  (3.7%)  were  AVA  positive  at  least  1  time  point  in  the  induction  phase,  the 
maintenance phase or the open-label cohort. Of these, 3 subjects (2.8%) were persistently positive and 
1 subject (0.9%) was transiently positive. Of these 4 AVA positive subjects, 3 subjects were positive for 
neutralizing antibodies. 
Infusion reactions occurred in 1 subject of AVA positive. This subject received MLN0002 in the induction 
phase and placebo in the maintenance phase, then, experienced throat irritation during the open-label 
cohort. This event was mild in intensity, non-serious, considered related to the study drug and resolved. 
This event was not a TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation.

and 12.7% (10/79 subjects) in the MLN0002 group, and no marked difference was observed between 
the treatment groups. Most of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs were observed 
in 3 subjects (3.8%) in the placebo group and in 1 subject (1.3%) in the MLN0002 group. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was 15.4% (12/78 subjects) in the placebo 
group, and 3.8% (3/79 subjects) in the MLN0002 group, and was higher in the placebo group than in 
the MLN0002 group. The incidence of serious TEAEs was 12.8% (10/78 subjects) in the placebo group, 
and  10.1%  (8/79  subjects)  in  the  MLN0002  group.  Drug-related  serious  TEAEs  were  observed  in  4 
subjects (5.1%) in the placebo group, and 1 subject (1.3%) in the MLN0002 group. No deaths occurred. 
TEAEs by SOC with an incidence of ≥10% in any treatment groups were, “Infections and infestations” 
(23.1%  in  the  placebo  group  and  30.4%  in  the  MLN0002  group,  same  applies  hereafter), 
“Gastrointestinal disorders” (28.2% and 16.5%), “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” (6.4% and 
12.7%), and “General disorders and administration site condition” (3.8% and 10.1%). 
Infusion reactions in the induction phase were observed in 1 subject (1.3%) in the placebo group and in 
4 subjects (5.1%) in the MLN0002 group. All events occurred in only 1 subject each. These events were 
mild in intensity, and were resolved during the study period.  
TEAEs  in  the  “Infections  and  infestations”  SOC  were  observed  in  18  subjects  (23.1%)  in  the  placebo 
group, 24 subjects (30.4%) in the MLN0002 group. Of these TEAEs, the most frequently reported TEAE 
by  PT  was  nasopharyngitis,  that  was  reported  in  11  subjects  (14.1%)  in  the  placebo  group,  and  11 
subjects (13.9%) in the MLN0002 group. 
The  TEAEs  in  the  “Neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified  (incl  cysts  and  polyps)”  SOC  were 
pyogenic granuloma (mild in intensity, nonserious, and related to study drug) in 1 subject in the placebo 
group and thyroid adenoma (moderate in intensity, serious, and related to study drug) in 1 subject in 
the MLN0002 group. 
Maintenance phase 
The incidence of TEAEs was 83.3% (10/12 subjects) in the placebo group, 75.0% (9/12 subjects) in the 
MLN0002 group, and 70.6% (12/17 subjects) in the placebo continuation group. The incidence of drug-
related TEAEs was 8.3% (1/12 subjects) in the placebo group, 16.7% (2/12 subjects) in the MLN0002 
group  and  no  subjects  in  the  placebo  continuation  group,  and  no  marked  difference  was  observed 
between the treatment groups. All of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and no severe TEAEs 
were observed in any treatment groups. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation was 33.3% (4/12 subjects) in the placebo 
group,  16.7%  (2/12  subjects)  in  the  MLN0002  group,  and  11.8%  (2/17  subjects)  in  the  placebo 
continuation group. 
The incidence of serious TEAEs was 33.3% (4/12 subjects) in the placebo group, 16.7% (2/12 subjects) 
in  the  MLN0002  group,  and  11.8%  (2/17  subjects)  in  the  placebo  continuation  group.  Drug-related 
serious TEAEs were observed in 1 subject in the MLN0002 group. No deaths occurred. 
TEAEs by SOC with an incidence of ≥10% in any treatment groups were observed in 1 subject in the 
“Infections  and  infestations”  (50.0%,  50.0%,  and  52.9%  in  the  placebo,  MLN0002,  and  placebo 
continuation  groups,  respectively),  “Gastrointestinal  disorders”  (41.7%,  33.3%,  and  35.3%,

“General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions”  (8.3%,  8.3%,  and  11.8%,  respectively),  and 
“Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (0%, 16.7%, and 0%, respectively). 
TEAEs by PT which occurred in at least 2 subjects in any treatment groups were nasopharyngitis (4, 4, 
and 4 subjects in the placebo, MLN0002, and placebo continuation groups, respectively), Crohn's disease 
(2, 1, and 3 subjects, respectively), and conjunctivitis (0, 0, and 2 subjects, respectively). TEAEs by PT

The trend of TEAEs in the ”Safety Analysis Set in open-label cohort” was not markedly different from 
that in the “Safety Analysis Set in induction phase” or the “Safety Analysis Set in maintenance phase”. 
Paediatric subjects 
Three  pediatric  patients  (15,  16,  and  17  years  old),  experienced  a  serious  TEAEs,  as  reported  in  the 
“Narratives of other Serious Adverse Events”. However, they were considered not treatment related by 
the investigator and the Applicant, as follows: 
1): Japanese Male 15 years old.  
<Aggravation of Crohn's disease> 
Investigator’s comment:  
The  event  is  considered  as  symptomatic  relapse  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  of  the  drugs  for  the  primary 
disease and the study drug. Thus, the event is considered not causally related to the study drug. Since 
the  event  interfered  with  the  patient's  daily  life,  its  intensity  is  moderate.  Since  the  patient  was 
hospitalized for bowel rest, close examination, and treatment, the event is reported as a serious adverse 
event. The event is considered not causally related to study procedures. 
Applicant’s comment: 
Crohn's disease is characterized by repeated recurrence/relapse and remission, and thus the event is 
considered part of the natural course of the primary disease. 
<Abdominal pain> 
Investigator’s comment:  
The patient had an acute onset of abdominal pain after a marathon race, and he had similar episodes of 
exercise-induced abdominal pain in past. Thus, the event is considered not causally related to the study 
drug.  Since  the  patient's  status  including  hyperpnea  interfered  with  his  daily  life,  the  intensity  of  the 
event is moderate. Since the patient was hospitalized for bed rest and observation, the event is reported 
as a serious adverse event. The event is considered not causally related to study procedures. 
Applicant’s comment: 
Crohn's disease is characterized by repeated recurrence/relapse and remission, and thus the event is 
considered part of the natural course of the primary disease. 
2): Japanese Male 17 years old.  
<Crohn's disease> 
Investigator’s comment:  
The patient experienced aggravation of his primary disease, and the event is considered not related to 
the study drug or study procedures. 
Applicant’s comment: 
Crohn’s disease is characterized by repeated recurrence/relapse and remission, and thus the event is 
considered part of the natural course of the primary disease. 
3): Japanese Male 16 years old.  
<Aggravation of Crohn's disease> 
Investigator’s comment: 
Since  the  patient's  Crohn's  disease  worsened  to  the  level  exceeding  his  usual  fluctuations,  it  was 
considered as an adverse event. The patient experienced similar episode prior to study participation, and

thus the event is considered not related to the study drug. The event is considered not causally related 
to study procedures. 
Applicant’s comment: 
Crohn's disease is characterized by repeated recurrence/relapse and remission, and thus the event is 
considered part of the natural course of the primary disease. 
<Aggravation of Crohn's disease> 
Investigator’s comment: 
The event occurred after the dose increase of steroid used as a rescue medication for aggravation of 
Crohn's disease. The event is considered not related to the study drug. 
Applicant’s comment: 
Crohn's disease is characterized by repeated recurrence/relapse and remission, and thus the event is 
considered part of the natural course of the primary disease. 
No  PMLs  were  observed  in  the  open-label  cohort.  In  the  open-label  cohort,  positive  Subjective  PML 
checklist was observed in 4 subjects. Of these subjects, the 2 subjects also having positive Objective 
PML checklist were evaluated by the Independent Adjudication Committee for PML, but PML was ruled 
out. 
There was no new safety signal reported in this study.  
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In order to comply with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation, the MAH submitted a final report(s) for 
Study MLN0002/CCT-001, a phase 3 study of vedolizumab 300 mg (powder for concentrate for solution 
for  infusion)  in  Crohn’s  disease  (CD)  conducted  in  Japan.  This  study  is  not  part  of  the  vedolizumab 
Paediatic Investigational Plan (PIP) EMEA-000645-PIP01-09.   
In this phase 3 program in Japan the age entry criteria was from 15 to 80 years old subjects.  
Six paediatric subjects entered the study for the induction phase (1 randomized in the vedolizumab and 
5 in the placebo arm). Two subjects in the placebo group had response in the induction phase and thus 
continued on placebo in the maintenance phase. The other 4 subjects (1 in vedolizumab and 3 in placebo) 
had no response in the induction phase. All 6 subjects continued into the open-label extension cohort.  
An assessment of efficacy results for the whole study is out of the scope of this AR. Moreover, stratified 
data on pediatric patients have not been provided not allowing any efficacy evaluation of vedolizumab in 
this target population, which is the object of this assessment. 
However,  in  the  overall  population  results  on  both  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  do  not  formally 
support efficacy, as only a limited numerical gain over placebo is seen.   
The number of Japanese pediatric patients included in this Study is considered too low to add important 
efficacy  information  on  the  vedolizumab  treatment  in  this  patient  population.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  a 
subgroup  analysis  does  not  allow  to  draw  firm  conclusion.  Therefore,  the  information  provided  are 
considered not informative and, as consequence, an update of the SmPC is at present not required.  
Overall, from a safety point of view no new signal seems to be occurred in this study. Stratified safety 
data  in  the  six  pediatric  patients  have  not  been  provided,  therefore the  vedolizumab  safety  profile  in 
these very few Japanese pediatric patients remains unknown. Two SAEs were identified in 15-, 16-, and 
17-year old patients from the Narratives of other Serious Adverse Events. They were both considered 
not to be related to study treatment by the investigators (however, lack of efficacy indicates relationship 
with  study  drug).  Overall,  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  regarding  the  safety  profile  in  pediatric 
patients.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In  order  to  comply  with  Article  46  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation,  the  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for 
Study MLN0002/CCT-001, a phase 3 study of vedolizumab 300 mg in CD conducted in Japan, not part 
of the vedolizumab PIP EMEA-000645-PIP01-09.   
Overall, the very low number of Japanese pediatric patients included in this Study (1 randomized in the 
vedolizumab and 5 in the placebo arm) does not add efficacy information on the vedolizumab treatment 
in pediatric patient population and the lack of a subgroup analysis does not allow to draw firm conclusion. 
Moreover,  stratified  safety  data  in  the  six  pediatric  patients  have  not  been  provided,  therefore  the 
vedolizumab safety profile in these very few Japanese pediatric patients remains unknown. Two SAEs 
were identified in 15-, 16-, and 17-year old patients, but they were both considered not to be related to 
study treatment by the investigators (although one was lack of efficacy). 
In conclusion, the information provided are considered not informative and, as consequence, an update 
of the SmPC is at present not required.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

To update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on interim safety and immunogenicity data of a 
third booster dose of Comirnaty (COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BioNTech) from study C4591001, a “Phase 
1/2/3, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, interventional, dose-finding, study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in 
healthy individuals”. Further substantiating data is provided based on published real-world 
effectiveness data from Israel and the US. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
2.  Introduction 
BNT162b2 (Comirnaty), is to be administered intramuscularly (IM) as a series of two doses (0.3 mL 
each) three weeks apart. The MAH proposed to revise the currently approved dosing regimen to 
include a booster dose (third dose), which may be administered at approximately 6 months after Dose 
2. 
This AR summarises the data on immunogenicity and safety for a group of Phase 3 participants in 
Study C4591001 who received a booster (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (30 µg).  
Unblinding Considerations 
Starting 14 December 2020, individuals ≥16 years of age have been progressively unblinded in the 
study to receive BNT162b2 vaccination when eligible per protocol. Since 10 May 2021, adolescents 12 
to 15 years of age have been unblinded in the study to receive BNT162b2 as they became eligible. 
Unblinded participants continue in study follow-up in an open-label manner. 
Participants randomised into Phase 3 booster and variant strain vaccine groups remain blinded to their 
randomisation assignment at this time. Sponsor and site personnel responsible for the ongoing conduct 
of the study remain blinded to individual participants’ randomisation information for any who have not 
been unblinded. Safety evaluation for such participants by the study team remains blinded until a 
decision is made to unblind the entire study. A separate (from study conduct) unblinded submissions 
team is responsible for regulatory submissions.  
All participants continue to be expected to remain in study follow-up for a maximum of approximately 
2 years after Dose 2 of randomised study intervention.

3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591001 
Study C4591001 is the ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 registration study. It 
was started as a Phase 1/2 study in adults in the US, was then amended to expand the study to a 
global Phase 2/3 study planning to enrol enough participants to accrue sufficient COVID-19 cases to 
conduct a timely efficacy assessment; amended to include older adolescents 16 to 17 years of age, 
then later amended to include younger adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. Booster groups were 
subsequently added to evaluate boostability and protection against variant virus strains. 
3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Booster and Variant Strain Evaluation 
Phase 1 
Phase 1 participants who were randomized to either BNT162b1 or BNT162b2 at dose levels of 10, 20, 
or 30 µg were offered booster vaccination (Dose 3) with BNT162b2 at 30 µg, approximately 6 to 12 
months after their second dose of BNT162b1 or BNT162b2. This provided an early assessment of the 
safety and immunogenicity associated with a third vaccine dose.  
Preliminary data from Phase 1 booster study participants who previously received BNT162b2 30 µg and 
then received a third dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, including neutralization of the B.1.351 (Beta) variant of 
SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 are presented in current AR as supporting 
information. Altogether 23 participants received a booster dose, whereas 11 of them were at age 18-
55 and 12 at age 65-85. 
Phase 2/3 
Phase 2/3 of Study C4591001 commenced with the selected vaccine candidate and dose level 
(BNT162b2 at 30 µg) administered to participants randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo.  
Phase 2 was conducted in the US. The Phase 2 portion of the study evaluated reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity for 360 participants 18 to 85 years of age enrolled into the study when the Phase 2/3 
part commenced, balancing younger (≤55 years of age) and older (>55 years of age) strata within 
each group. Phase 2 participants in this blinded part of the study also contribute to the overall efficacy 
and safety assessments in the Phase 3 portion of the study. 
Phase 3 (which is ongoing) included planned interim analyses of the first primary efficacy endpoint, 
ongoing efficacy and safety evaluations including reactogenicity assessment in a subset of participants, 
and exploratory vaccine immunogenicity evaluation in a subset of participants. Phase 3 is being 
conducted at sites in the US, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, South Africa, and Germany. Participants were 
stratified by age group as previously described. The final efficacy analysis was conducted when at least 
the prespecified total number of 164 efficacy events accrued. Safety and long-term persistence of 
efficacy follow-up will continue for at least 2 years and/or end of study. Safety and efficacy analyses 
included the 360 participants who were analysed for Phase 2.  
For further evaluation of booster effects and/or protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of 
concern, approximately 600 existing Phase 3 participants 18 to 55 years of age were randomized 1:1 
to receive a booster (Dose 3) of either 30 µg BNT162b2 or a prototype vaccine based upon the B.1.351 
(Beta) variant that originated in South Africa, BNT162b2SA, approximately 6 months after their second 
dose of BNT162b2. Only data for those receiving BNT162b2 are included in this application.

Immunogenicity evaluation 
Immunogenicity Endpoints in Study C4591001 
BNT162b2 booster (Dose 3) effectiveness is based on immunobridging to the immune response after 
Dose 2 in participants. SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers were compared at 1-month post-Dose 3 to 
those observed at 1-month post-Dose 2, for the same participants for the SARS-CoV-2 reference 
strain.  
Immunogenicity endpoints were: 
i) 
geometric mean titers (GMT) and geometric mean ratio (GMR) of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
titer at 1 month after Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 2  
ii) 
percentages and difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse at 1 month 
after Dose 3 and 1 month after Dose 2, where seroresponse is defined as achieving a 
≥4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1); for baseline measurement <LLOQ, 
postvaccination measure ≥4 × LLOQ is considered seroresponse. 
iii) 
geometric mean-fold rise (GMFR) from before Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3. 
Immunogenicity Analysis Methods 
Assay validation reports were provided in Module 2.7.1. Only a validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization 
assay was used for Phase 3 immunogenicity data. Immunogenicity endpoints are summarized in 
Section 0 and immunogenicity analysis methods are summarized below. 
CHMP’s comment: The MAH states that only validated neutralization assay was used. According to 
the description in Module 2.7.1 mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 Microneutralization Assay is qualified and 
not validated. It was accepted that the neutralization assay is not yet validated in previous procedures 
(e.g. CMA and extension of indication) as vaccine efficacy data were presented and immunogenicity 
data were considered supportive only. However, the current application the validity of the 
neutralisation assay is crucial as no vaccine efficacy data of 3rd dose are presented. Therefore, the MAH 
is asked to submit validation reports for the immunogenicity assays used. Also, it is noted, that there 
is no information about neutralization assay with Beta and Delta strains.  
In response to the preliminary list of questions, the MAH submitted the validation report for Wuhan 
strain dated at 09.02.2021. This document demonstrated the reliability of the assay. The validation 
report did not contain information about Delta and Beta strain validation. As the information in the 
application about these strains was supportive, we hereby do not pursue further this issue. 
The statistical analyses of immunogenicity data from Study C4591001 were based on the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations and all-available immunogenicity populations.

immunogenicity 
All randomized participants who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 at initial 
randomization, received a third dose of BNT162b2 or BNT162b2SA at 
rerandomization, and had at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity 
result after Dose 3. 
Booster safety 
All participants who received at least 1 booster dose of the study intervention. 
Noninferiority was assessed based on the GMR of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers at 1 month after Dose 
3 to 1 month after Dose 2 using a 1.5-fold margin and comparison of the point estimate of the GMR to 
0.8. The GMR was calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed titers for 
each participant (e.g., later time point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean. The 
associated 2-sided 97.5% CIs were obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s t distribution for the 
mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence limits. Noninferiority was 
declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 97.5% CI for the GMR was >0.67 and the point estimate of 
the GMR was ≥0.8. 
Noninferiority was also assessed based on the difference in percentages of participants with a 
seroresponse defined as a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1) at 1 month after Dose 3 and 1 
month after Dose 2 using a 10% margin. If the baseline measurement is below LLOQ, the 
postvaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ is considered seroresponse. The difference in percentages 
(1 month after Dose 3 – 1 month after Dose 2) and the associated 2-sided 97.5% CI calculated using 
the adjusted Wald interval as described by Agresti and Min were provided. Noninferiority was declared 
if the lower limit of the 97.5% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse 
was greater than -10%.  
Noninferiority analyses were conducted for participants without prior serological or virological evidence, 
by N-binding antibody or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), respectively, of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
up to 1 month after Dose 3. 
GMTs and GMFRs were provided with associated 2-sided 95% CIs calculated with reference to 
Student’s t-distribution. Titers/concentrations below the LLOQ or denoted as BLQ were set to 0.5 × 
LLOQ for all analyses except for seroresponse. 
Assuming a 20% non-evaluable rate, approximately 240 evaluable participants in the BNT162b2 
booster group were planned to contribute to immunogenicity evaluation, to provide sufficient power for 
noninferiority evaluation with appropriate multiplicity adjustment for type I error control. The study 
had >99.9% power to demonstrate noninferiority based on GMR for the objectives in vaccine-
experienced individuals using a 1.5-fold margin, and 99% power or 89% power to show noninferiority 
based on seroresponse rate under the assumption of moderate or high discordance in response status 
at 2 comparative timepoints for the objectives in vaccine-experienced individuals using a 10% margin. 
Note that blood samples collected at Visit 1 (before Dose 1), Visit 3 (1 month post Dose 2), Visit 301 
(before booster dose), Visit 302 (1 week after booster dose), and Visit 303 (1 month post booster 
dose) were planned to be tested for the immunogenicity assessment. During clinical testing, due to 
higher repeating rate, the viral reagent for the assay was not sufficient to complete testing of all 
samples. Testing was reprioritized for samples from critical time points for hypothesis testing, which 
resulted smaller number of sample size for the 1 week after booster dose visit.

CHMP´s comment: The immunogenicity endpoints chosen, as well as the non-inferiority margins are 
acceptable. Considering that there is no serological correlate of protection, the non-inferiority margins 
are considered arbitrary, but are commonly used for comparing immune responses in vaccine studies.  
3.2.  Results 
Immunogenicity Populations 
Among the 312 participants who were rerandomized to receive a booster (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 30 
µg, the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population included 268 participants, and those 
without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 include 234 participants (Table 1). The 
most common reason for exclusion (30 [9.6%] participants) from the evaluable immunogenicity 
population was that they had important protocol deviation(s) as determined by the clinician. The 
majority of these protocol deviations included 16 (53.3%) participants with Visit 301 (booster 
[Dose 3] vaccination) conducted outside the protocol-specified window.

The median duration between Dose 2 and Dose 3 was 6.8 months (range: 4.8 to 8.0 months) . 49.7% 
of participants who received booster (Dose 3) administration between 6 and <7 months after receiving 
Dose 2. Fewer than 10% of participants received Dose 3 at <6 months following Dose 2. Dose 3 was 
administered ≥7 months after Dose 2 for 41.0% of participants; this included 16 participants who 
received Dose 3 outside of the protocol defined window (ie, <150 days or >210 days after Dose 2). 
CHMP’s comment: The interval between dose 2 and dose 3 was approximately 6 months. No 
justification for this interval is given.  
Demographics 
The demographic characteristics of the study population are summarised in Table 2. Demographics in 
the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population were generally similar to those without 
evidence of infection up to 1 month after the booster dose in the same population, similar to those in 
the Dose 3 booster all-available immunogenicity population, and similar to the booster safety 
population.

Noninferiority of Booster Response to Initial Regimen Response 
Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) of Neutralization Titers to Reference Strain 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster 
(Dose 3), the immune response to BNT162b2 30 µg at 1 month after the booster (Dose 3) was 
noninferior to that observed at 1 month after Dose 2 in the same participants, based on SARS-CoV-2 
50% neutralizing titers (Table 3). 
The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMT ratio of 1 month after Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 2 was 3.29 (2-
sided 97.5% CI: 2.76, 3.91), which meets the 1.5-fold noninferiority criterion (i.e., lower bound of the 
2-sided 97.5% CI for GMR >0.67) and point estimate of GMR ≥0.8. 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 97.5% CI for the GMR is >1, which indicates a statistically greater 
response following booster (Dose 3) administration than that observed following Dose 2. 
The GMR result for the Dose 3 booster all-available immunogenicity population was similar to those 
observed for the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population. 
CHMP’s comment: The GMTs were clearly superior after dose 3 compared to after dose 2, and the 
non-inferiority margins were clearly met. The seroresponse rates were very high after the second dose 
(98%, and as can be expected were high also after the third dose (99.5%).  
Efficacy has been demonstrated after two doses, although the duration of protection is unknown. The 
role of persisting high antibody titres and the role of immunological memory are currently not 
characterised for protection against covid-19.

Difference in Seroresponse Rate to Reference Strain 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster 
(Dose 3), a high proportion of participants (99.5%) had seroresponse (defined as ≥4-fold rise from 
baseline before Dose 1) at 1 month after Dose 3 compared with 98.0% at 1 month after Dose 2 (Table 
4). 
The difference in proportions of participants with a seroresponse 1 month after the booster (Dose 3) 
and 1 month after Dose 2 (Dose 3 – Dose 2) was 1.5% (2-sided 97.5% CI: -0.7, 3.7%), which meets 
the 10% noninferiority margin (i.e., lower bound of the 2-sided 97.5% CI was greater than -10%). 
The seroresponse result for the Dose 3 booster all-available immunogenicity population was similar to 
those observed for the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Titers  
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to Reference Strain 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster 
(Dose 3), at 1 month after the booster (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 30 µg, SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing 
GMTs increased substantially relative to GMTs observed prior to receipt of Dose 3 (Table 5).  
The median duration between receipt of Dose 2 and the booster with Dose 3 was 6.8 months. GMTs 
had declined by the time the booster (Dose 3) was administered. From Dose 2 up to the day of Dose 3 
administration (before booster vaccination), GMTs were 136.2 (2-sided 95% CI: 121.5, 152.6), which 
represents a 5.59-fold reduction compared to that observed at 1 month after Dose 2. 
Following booster (Dose 3) vaccination, GMTs were increased by 7 days post-Dose 3 to 1418.7 (95% 
CI: 1263.3, 1593.3). By 1 month after Dose 3, GMTs were further elevated to 2374.2 (95% CI: 
2134.1, 2641.3), a level 17.4-fold that observed on the day of booster vaccination (prior to receipt of 
Dose 3). 
Overall, among participants in the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population, 
the neutralizing GMTs at 1 month after Dose 3 were substantially greater than that observed at 
1 month after Dose 2 (ie, 3-fold), showing a strong boost to the neutralizing antibody response.  
The SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMTs for all participants in the Dose 3 booster evaluable 
immunogenicity population regardless of prior infection status and the Dose 3 booster all-available 
immunogenicity population were similar to those observed for the Dose 3 booster evaluable 
immunogenicity population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster 
(Dose 3).

CHMP’s comment: The GMT and seroresponse rate results support the increased immune responses 
after a third dose compared to 1 month after dose 2, and before dose 3. It is noted that about 20% of 
study population had become seronegative at the day for receiving 3rd dose. It is unclear if these 
subjects had longest time period from the last dose or it is related to the demographic characteristics 
such as age and BMI.

third dose (booster) of BNT162b2 30 µg approximately 7 to 9 months after the second dose. Data 
were collected through the cut-off date of 13 May 2021.  
Immunogenicity Endpoints and Analysis Methods 
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralization titers were assessed in sera drawn before BNT162b2 Dose 1 (on 
Day 1); 7 days and 1 month after BNT162b2 Dose 2; before Dose 3; and 7 days and 1 month after 
Dose 3. Neutralization titers were determined as described previously against the designated wild-
type (recombinant USA-WA1/2020) and against the B.1.351 (recombinant USA-WA1/2020 bearing 
the full spike gene from Beta variant) and against B.1.617.2 (recombinant USA-WA1/2020 with the 
full spike gene from the Delta variant) lineage target strains. All samples from each of the time 
points were analysed for this evaluation (i.e., previously tested samples were reanalysed). 
Study population 
The study was conducted at 2 sites in the US. As of the data cut-off date (13 May 2021), 23/24 
original Phase 1 participants who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 30 µg received a third dose (booster) 
of BNT162b2 30 µg. One original participant declined to receive Dose 3.

Immunogenicity results for booster group in Phase I study 
Reference strain and beta strain comparison 
The Dose 3 all-available immunogenicity population included all randomized participants who received 
2 doses of BNT162b2 as initially randomized, received a third BNT162b2 dose, and had at least 1 
valid and determinate immunogenicity result after Dose 3. Valid neutralization titers were obtained 
from all 23 participants. 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization GMTs against the wild-type USA-WA1/2020 strain (a clinical strain isolated 
in January 2020) substantially increased after Dose 3. GMTs at 1 month after Dose 3 were 2119 (95% 
CI:  1229.1,  3653.4)  for  younger  participants 18  to 55  years  of  age,  and  2032  (95%  CI:  1232.6, 
3349.3) for older participants 65 to 85 years of age, which were >5-fold and >7-fold, respectively, 
those of the GMTs observed at 1 month after Dose 2  (Figure 3). 
Geometric mean Fold Rise (GMFRs) 
GMFRs against the wild-type strain from before Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 were 25.7 (95% CI: 
12.4, 53.3) for younger adults, and 49.4 (95% CI: 29.2, 83.3) for older adults (see Table 8). 
A third dose of BNT162b2 administered 7 to 9 months after the original two-dose series also 
increased the neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus (recombinant 
virus was based on the USA-WA1/2020 clinical strain and incorporated the complete spike gene from 
the B.1.351 variant2). At 1 month after Dose 3, GMTs were 1546 (95% CI: 888.1, 2692.4) for 
younger participants, and 1567 (95% CI: 875.2, 2804.7) for older participants, which were >15-fold 
and >20-fold, respectively, those of the GMTs observed at 1 month after Dose 2 (Figure 1). 
GMFRs against B.1.351 from before Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 were 38.7 (95% CI: 19.8, 75.5) 
for younger adults, and 78.3 (95% CI: 40.7, 150.6) for older adults (see Table 6). 
The difference between neutralizing titers against the wild-type virus and the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-
2 lineage observed after Dose 2 narrowed after BNT162b2 Dose 3 (Figure 3). Specifically, at 1 
month after Dose 2, the GMRs of neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 virus to neutralizing titers 
against the wild-type virus were 0.27 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.39) for younger adults and 0.29 (95% CI: 
0.17, 0.49) for older adults; at 1 month after Dose 3, the corresponding GMRs increased to 0.73 
(95% CI: 0.52, 1.02) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.16).  
CHMP’s comment: The phase 1 data support the overall conclusion from the phase 3 data, i.e. 
that neutralising antibody titres are increased to high levels after the third dose, at least as high 
as after the second dose, possibly higher. The sample size is small, and therefore the confidence 
intervals are large. The results of neutralising antibody responses against the beta variant are 
also of interest and the results indicate a broader immune response after a third dose compared 
to the second dose, but as already stated the sample size is small and confidence intervals wide. 
This data needs verification in a larger sample.

Reference strain and delta strain comparison 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) 
Neutralizing GMTs against recombinant virus with the Delta variant spike on a wild-type genetic 
background showed a similar pattern of higher, broader neutralizing titers after Dose 3 as 
compared to after Dose 2 (Figure 2, Table 9). 
GMTs against the wild-type (reference) USA-WA1/2020 strain substantially increased after Dose 
3 compared to GMTs obtained after Dose 2. GMTs at 1 month after Dose 3 were 1748.5 (95% 
CI: 1030.7, 2966.2) for younger participants, and 1595.9 (95% CI: 810.9, 3140.6) for older 
participants, which were approximately 5-fold and 8-fold, respectively, those of the GMTs 
observed at 1 month after Dose 2 (Figure 2, Table 9).

A third dose of BNT162b2 administered 7 to 9 months after the original two-dose series also increased 
the neutralizing titers against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant strain. (Figure 2, Table 9). 
Geometric Mean Ratios (GMRs) 
At 1 month after Dose 2, the GMR of neutralizing titers for younger adults against theB.1.617.2 (Delta) 
variant strain to neutralizing titers against the wild-type strain were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.99); at 1 
month after Dose 3, the GMR increased to 0.87 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.07). Similarly, in older adults at 1 
month after Dose 2, the GMR of neutralizing titers against  the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant strain to 
neutralizing titers against the wild-type strain were 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.84); at 1 month after Dose 
3 increased to 0.88 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.14) (Table 10). 
GMRs for neutralizing titers against the wild-type (reference) strain and against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) 
variant strain at 1 month after Dose 3 compared to neutralizing titers against the wild-type strain at 1 
month after Dose 2 ranged from 4.76 to 7.51, showing substantial increases after the booster (Dose 3) 
of BNT162b2 compared to Dose 2 (Table 11) 
CHMP’s comment: The results for the delta variant are overall in agreement with the results for the 
beta variant and the reference strain. In Table 11, GMR, note that neutralising antibodies against the 
delta variant after dose 3 are compared to the neutralising antibody titres to the reference strain after 
dose 2 and 3. It is not clear if it is appropriate to directly compare titres against different virus strains. 
As above, the sample size is small and confidence intervals wide, precluding conclusions. The 
presented results are considered supportive of a booster response, but further analyses are required, 
i.e. a larger sample size and comparisons relating to the same variant at different time points.

3.3.  Discussion 
Immune Response to Booster (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 30 µg 
The presented interim results for a third dose of BNT162b2 given at approximately 6 months after 
dose 2, show that higher neutralising titres are obtained after the third dose compared to the second 
dose. No justification on why the timepoint was chosen to give 3rd dose, was provided with the initial 
submission package, but was clarified in the responses to the LoQ. The neutralising titres had declined 
before the third dose was given compared to 1 month after dose 2, as can be expected, but were still 
clearly elevated compared to baseline levels. As there is no serological correlate of protection, the 
relevance of the waning titres is currently unknown. It is clear that immunological memory is elicited 
by the initial doses, and that a booster response can be obtained. The role of a third dose for long-
term protection is not known at this stage. 
The presented data were obtained in younger adults, 18-55 years of age, and only very limited data 
from the phase 1 part of study C4591001 (n=12) in subjects 65-85 years of age. It can be anticipated 
that elderly subjects would need of a booster dose within a shorter interval compared to younger 
adults, due to immune senescence with increasing age. It is noted that subjects over 65 years had 
elevated neutralising titres before the third dose compared to baseline. The MAH was asked to present 
any plans to further study the effect of a third dose in elderly subjects and clarified that study 
C4591031 will provide safety and efficacy data for a third dose in elderly (over 55 years) individuals. 
There are no data on a third dose in subjects younger than 18 years of age, and therefore the 
posology section mentioning the use of a third dose should be limited to subjects 18 years of age and 
older. The MAH was asked present any plans to further study the effect of a third dose in adolescents 
and clarified that study C4591031 will provide safety and efficacy data for a third dose in younger (i.e. 
below 18 years of age) individuals. Also, further studies are being planned to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose in participants 12-15 years of age and participants <12 years.  
Preliminary results on neutralising antibody titres to the beta and delta variants were presented from a 
small group of subjects from the phase 1 part of the study. The small sample size limits the 
conclusions that can be drawn and are considered supportive of increased titers following a third dose 
compared to a second dose, and possibly also a broader antibody repertoire, although this would need 
to be confirmed in a larger sample.  
As the efficacy evaluation is based entirely on immunogenicity data, it is crucial that the neutralization 
assay, which was used to measure vaccine induced antibodies, is fully validated. In the initial 
submission package, only the brief qualification report from December 2020 was available, and no 
validation reports were found in the dossier although the MAH stated in the Clinical Overview that the 
method is fully validated. Therefore, the MAH was requested to submit the assay validation report and 
the neutralisation assays for the variant strains. The issue is solved as the MAH submitted 
neutralization assay validation report dated at 09.02.2021 in their responses to the RSI. 
It seems difficult to conclude on an optimal vaccination schedule to ensure long-term protection 
against several variants of SARS-CoV2. There are no data on duration of protection available, and 
there is no comparison of two doses given at least 3 weeks apart compared to three doses with the 
third dose given around 6 months after the second dose. In addition, there are no data on other time 
points for the third dose. Thus, the benefit of a third dose is a potential added duration of immunity 
together with a potential broadening of the antibody repertoire to cover new variants.  
The current data are of course obtained in a clinical trial setting, while the dose interval between dose 
1 and 2 can be considerably longer in a practical use. In fact, several countries have recommended 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/575859/2021 
Page 25/57 
 
 
 
 
longer dose intervals during at least in initial phases of vaccination campaigns. The effect of a longer 
dose interval between dose 1 and 2 and the effect on a third dose is currently unknown. It is possible 
that a longer interval between dose 1 and 2 result in increased responses to dose 2, and thereby also 
opening for an even longer interval to dose 3.  
The MAH stated that further studies of BNT162b2 booster and boosting with vaccine candidates that 
use the same mRNA technology but encode spike glycoproteins from variants of concern, such as 
B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, are ongoing or planned, respectively, including a study with a larger number of 
participants and randomization of participants to booster or placebo. The results of these studies are 
awaited when available. In addition, data on giving an additional dose of Comirnaty to subjects who 
have received one or two doses of other covid-19 vaccines previously would also be of value.  
In conclusion, the benefit of a third dose given at approximately 6 months after the second dose can 
be summarised as potentially resulting in a longer lasting protection and broadened antibody 
repertoire.  
4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
The primary safety objective regarding the third dose was: 
- 
To describe the safety and tolerability profile of BNT162b2 given as a third dose to BNT162b2 
experienced participants by using interim data for BNT162b2 given as a third dose to 
BNT162b2 experienced participants only are reported in this CSR. 
The assessment of boostability was conducted in a subset of Phase 3 participants aged 18-55 years of 
age at selected sites in the US who received a third dose of BNT162b2 at 30 µg at least 6 months after 
their second dose. 
4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The study is observer-blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine candidates 
and the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff are 
blinded. At the study site, only the dispenser(s)/administrator(s) are unblinded. 
Inclusion criteria for the boostability and protection-against-VOCs subset: 
• 
Existing participants enrolled to receive a third dose of BNT162b2 at 30 µg or BNT162b2SA; 
male or female participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive, at 
rerandomization. 
•  Newly enrolled participants enrolled to receive 2 doses of BNT162b2SA; male or female 
participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive, at enrolment. 
• 
Existing participants enrolled to receive a third dose of BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg; male or 
female participants ≥18 years at rerandomization. 
Eligible individuals were those who continued to meet C4591001 inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
met criteria specific to boostability assessments, had completed both Dose 1 and Dose 2 of BNT162b2 
30μg, and consented to be rerandomized to receive 30 µg of either BNT162b2 orBNT162b2SAas a third 
dose.

Table 12. Investigation Product Lot Numbers – Interim – Booster (Dose 3) 
E-diary  
Participants in the subset of BNT162b2-experienced participants evaluated for BNT162b2 30 µg 
boostability were asked to monitor and record local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic 
medication use in the reactogenicity e-diary for 7 days following each administration of the study 
intervention. 
AEs and SAEs 
Participants in the BNT162b2-experienced subset evaluated for BNT162b2 30 μg boostability, AEs were 
collected from the time the participant provided informed consent (for participation in the subset) 
through and including Visit 303 (1-month follow-up visit after Dose 3) for those receiving 1 additional 
dose and Visit 305 (1 month follow-up visit after Dose 4) for those who received 2 additional doses. 
For both schedules, this equated to collection for up to 1 month after the last dose. SAEs were 
collected from the time the participant provided informed consent (for participation in the subset) 
through and including Visit 306 (5 or 6 months after the last dose, depending upon group). Acute 
reactions (immediate AEs) were collected within the first 30 minutes after administration of the study 
intervention. 
AESI  
While AESIs were not prespecified in the protocol, Pfizer utilizes a safety review as part of the signal 
detection processes that highlights specified TMEs of clinical interest. TMEs are specific AE terms 
reviewed on an ongoing basis by routine safety data review procedures throughout the clinical study. 
Although not prespecified in the protocol, TMEs are maintained in a separate list as part of the Safety 
Surveillance Review Plan for the vaccine program. By definition, TMEs are considered to be AESIs 
specific for a product or program's protocol(s). They are based on review of known pharmacology, 
toxicology findings, possible class effects, published literature, and potential signals arising from safety 
data assessments. The list of TMEs is customized for each development program and is dynamic. For 
this study, the list of TMEs includes events of interest because of their association with COVID-19 and 
terms of interest for vaccines in general. Terms are chosen from the MedDRA dictionary and may 
include PTs, high level term, high level group terms, or standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs; all 
evaluated as broad and narrow). 
CHMP´s Comment: 
In total 312 subjects aged 18-55 years from the part of the Phase 3 study executed in US have been 
included in a subset that received a third dose of BNT162b2 at 30 µg ≥5 months after their second 
dose. The participants used an E-diary to record all local reactions, systemic events and antipyretic 
Assessment report

medications for 7 days after the third dose was administered. Adverse events were recorded up to one 
month after the third dose and SAEs were collected up to 5-6 months after the last dose. 
It is endorsed that subjects already included in the phase 3 study were used to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of a third dose, however, number of subjects followed up for AEs and SAEs is very small, 
which clearly limits the possibility to detect any seldom occurring events.

Of the 312 participants who received a third dose, 6 participants who were rerandomized to receive a 
third dose of BNT162b2 30 µg were instead administered BNT162b2SA by error. These participants are 
not included in the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population analyses or safety analyses of 
the BNT162b2 booster group, to avoid confounding the BNT162b2 booster results interpretation

CHMP´s comment: 
Among the 312 initially included subjects that received a third dose, six of them received a dose of 
BNT162b2SA by error instead of BNT162b2 30 µg, therefore the safety population constitutes of 306 
subjects. Most of the subjects (91%) received their third dose ≥6 months after Dose 2. Almost all 
subjects (n=305) had a follow up of 2-4 months after the third dose. Subjects were roughly similarly 
distributed between gender. The majority of the subjects were white (81%), and it is noted that many 
of them (72%) had a BMI suggesting overweight or obesity.

4.2.1.  Safety evaluations 
4.2.1.1.  Local Reactions 
Pain at the injection site was most frequently reported local reaction after booster (Dose3) 
administration, reported by 83.0% of participants out of N=289 with e-diary data, as illustrated in the 
figure below: 
c 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/575859/2021 
Page 32/57 
 
 
 
 
 
The median onset for all local reactions after Dose 3 was Day 1 to Day 2 (Day 1 was the day of 
vaccination) and were resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days. Overall, the pattern of local 
reactions reported in this Phase 3 booster group after Dose 3 was generally similar to that observed in 
prior analyses of Phase 2/3 participants after Dose 2 (refer to C4591001 6-Month Update Interim CSR, 
dated 29 April 2021). 
CHMP´s comment: 
Information regarding reactogenicity was based on data from the E-diary as reported back of 289 
subjects.  
Overall, the local reactogenicity profile shown after the third dose appears to be in line with the 
reactogenicity profile observed after the second dose of the vaccine, with pain at the injection site as 
the most commonly reported reaction. Severe reactions occurred very rarely.

4.2.1.2.  Systemic Events 
Systemic events reported after booster (Dose 3) administration out of N=289 participants with e-diary 
data, of any severity and in decreasing order of frequency, were as illustrated in the figure below: 
Assessment report

Page 35/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After Dose 3, most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe systemic events were 
reported infrequently, in <2 % of participants for all systemic events except for severe fatigue (4.5%). 
Severe muscle pain was reported in 4 participants (1.4%), and severe headache or severe chills were 
reported in 3 participants each (1.0%). Severe joint pain was reported in 1 participant (0.3%). A fever 
of >38.9 °C to 40 °C was reported in 1 participant (0.3%); this individual had oral temperatures of 
39.1 °Con Day 2 and 38.6 °Con Day 3, that returned to normal on Days 4 through 7. No Grade 4 
systemic events were reported after Dose 3. 
The median onset for all systemic events after Dose 3 was Day 2 to Day 4 (Day 1 was the day of 
vaccination), and systemic events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days. Overall, the 
pattern of systemic events reported in this Phase 3 booster group after Dose 3 was generally similar to 
that observed in prior analyses of Phase 2/3 participants after Dose2 (refer to C4591001 6-Month 
Update Interim CSR, dated 29 April 2021). 
CHMP´s comment: 
The most common systemic event was fatigue (64%) of which 40% were moderate or severe. Almost 
half of the study population (n=135) used antipyretic or pain medication after the third dose. One 
subject reported an increased temperature >39oC. 
The limited number of subjects showed a similar pattern of systemic events and use of antipyretic or 
pain medication as what was observed after the second dose in the Phase 2/3 analysis of study 
C4591001.

4.2.1.3.  Adverse Events 
Safety evaluation of AEs is from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, and from Dose 3 to the data cut-off 
date (17 June 2021) which accounts for at least 2 months post-Dose 3 has been provided by the MAH.

After Booster Dose – Phase 3 – BNT162b2 – Experienced Subjects Who Were Rerandomized to Receive 
1 Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) – Booster Safety Population 
From Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (17 June2021), in addition to the participants who reported AEs 
up to 1month after Dose 3 one additional participant reported AE, for a cumulative number of 
participants with any AE of 45/306 (14.7%). As of the cut-off date, events considered by the 
investigator as related to study intervention remained the same as at 1 month after Dose 3, reported 
by 24/306 participants (7.8%). In addition to the participant with a severe AE of lymphadenopathy 
that was reported up to 1 month after Dose 3, as of the data cut-off date there was one additional 
participant who reported a severe AE; this event was considered an unrelated SAE (acute myocardial 
infarction). As of the data cut-off date, no events leading to withdrawal were reported and no study 
participants in this Phase 3 booster group died. 
Adverse Events from Dose 3 to 1 Month after Dose 3 
The most commonly reported AE was lymphadenopathy, in 16/306 participants (5.2%). AE frequencies 
in SOCs for such reactogenicity terms were:

CHMP’s comment: 
AEs presented belonged specifically to the SOCs blood and lymphatic system disorders (PT 
lymphadenopathy), general disorders and administration site conditions (local and systemic 
reactogenicity) and musculoskeletal disorders. 
Related Adverse Events 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 24/306 participants (7.8%) had AEs assessed by the 
investigator as related to study intervention. The most common related events were lymphadenopathy 
cases, in 16/306 participants (5.2%). Most of the other related AEs were reactogenicity events and in 
the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 7/306 participants 
(2.3%). 
All cases of lymphadenopathy had an onset within 1 to 4 days after BNT162b2 booster (Dose3) 
administration, and most were reported as recovered/resolved as of the data cut-off date, most within 
≤5 days after onset. These cases predominantly occurred in female participants and located in axillary 
nodes. One participant who had lymphadenopathy after receiving Dose 3 had also previously 
experienced lymphadenopathy (with onset on the fourth day after Dose 2) during the blinded placebo-
controlled period, as reported in the C4591001 6-Month Update Interim CSR. No participants in the 
booster safety population reported a past medical history of lymphadenopathy. All lymphadenopathy 
cases occurring after Dose 3 were Grade 1, with one exception: One case of lymphadenopathy was 
graded as severe and judged by the investigator as related to study intervention: left axillary 
lymphadenopathy was reported in a study participant 40-49 years of age with onset at 2 days post-
Dose 3, lasting for 5 days, and reported as recovered/resolved. The investigator-judged severity was 
based on the participant reporting that the lymphadenopathy prevented use of the affected arm.  
Overall, the incidence of lymphadenopathy in this Phase 3 booster group was higher than previously 
observed in Phase 2/3 AE analyses. Lymphadenopathy has been identified as a vaccine-related event 
and is more common after a booster (Dose 3) is administered reflecting a potent immune response. 
One event of dysgeusia “with coffee” (verbatim reporting) was reported in a study participant 20-29 
years of age with onset at 2 days after Dose 3, that was reported as recovered/resolved 72 days from 
onset. The event was Grade 1 in severity and considered by the investigator to be related to study 
intervention. This participant also reported nausea “caused by coffee” (verbatim reporting) at 2 days 
Assessment report

after Dose 3 that was recovered/resolved by 7 days after onset. At 3 days after Dose 3, the study 
participant again reported nausea along with headache and injection site pain that were all reported as 
recovered/resolved 6 days after onset. All of these events were considered by the investigator as 
related to study intervention. This participant also had severe fatigue recorded as a systemic event in 
the e-diary on Day 3 after Dose 3. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Cases evaluated as related comprised especially events lymphadenopathy (5.2%), which resolved 
mostly within 5 days after the third dose. One case was graded as severe. 
One case of mild dysgeusia was evaluated as related to study drug and reversible (72 days after dose 
3). 
Immediate Adverse Events 
No immediate events were reported within 30 minutes after booster (Dose 3) vaccination. 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, one severe event (lymphadenopathy) was reported by 1 
participant with an onset at 2 days post-Dose 3 and recovered/resolved 5 days from onset. No life-
threatening (Grade 4) events were reported. 
Adverse Events from Dose 3 to the Data Cut-off Date 
From Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (17 June2021), which represents at least 2 months of post-Dose 
3 follow-up, the cumulative number of participants with any AE included one additional AE beyond the 
1-month post-Dose 3 period of follow-up.  
The additional event was acute myocardial infarction, reported as an unrelated SAE of Grade 3 severity 
that was recovered/resolved with sequelae. The study participant 40-49 years of age with a BMI of 
27.9 kg/m3 received BNT162b2 30 µg Dose 1 on Day 0, Dose 2 on Day 21, and Dose 3 on Day 24. 
Sixty two (62) days after receiving Dose 3 the study participant presented to the emergency 
department with excruciating pain radiating from chest to the left jaw area; an electrocardiogram was 
unremarkable with no significant changes, troponin was elevated at 1.4 ng/mL (normal range not 
reported), a chest x-ray was normal except for mild hyperinflation, and a computerized tomography 
angiogram showed minimal atherosclerotic calcification and a calcified granuloma in the caudate lobe 
of the liver. The study participant was diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction (non-ST 
elevated) and was hospitalized upon cardiac consultation. The event was reported as Grade 3 SAE 
considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention and was reported as 
recovered/resolved with sequelae within 1 day of onset. The study participant had visited the 
emergency department 3 to 4 months prior due the current hospitalisation.  The study participant was 
discharged from the hospital for this episode 64 days after receiving Dose 3. The study participant was 
readmitted to the hospital one day later with dizziness, blurred vision, diaphoresis, chest pain, fatigue, 
and heartburn. The study participant reported that the “heart was racing,” and the heart rate was 
noted to be 51 beats per minute. The troponin levels were elevated but declining (values not 
provided).  
CHMP´s comment: 
Overall, among the 306 subjects that received a third dose, 44 (14%) reported any adverse events up 
to one month after administration of the third dose. No events of death were reported. Twenty-four of 
the adverse events were considered related by the investigator, of which lymphadenopathy (n=16) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/575859/2021 
Page 40/57 
 
 
 
 
 
was most commonly reported. One of the events of left axillary lymphadenopathy was graded as 
severe and lasted for 5 days. It is noted that in this limited study population, the incidence of 
lymphadenopathy was higher after the third dose compared to what was observed after the second 
dose in the Phase 2/3 analysis of study C4591001 (5.2% vs 0.4%). The information regarding different 
frequencies of lymphadenopathy has been included in the SmPC by the MAH. 
Dysgeusia “with coffee” was reported in one study participant, the event was considered related to the 
vaccine by the investigator and resolved 72 days after the third dose.  
One overweight 40-49 year-old study participant, with a confounding medical history reported an acute 
myocardial infarction 3 months after the third dose. The event was not considered related to the study 
treatment by the investigator, which can be agreed. 
It can be concluded that a low number of adverse events have been reported after the third dose. 
However, the sample size is very limited, and it is therefore not possible to draw conclusions regarding 
uncommon or rare adverse events. 
4.2.2.  Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, Safety-Related Participant 
Withdrawals, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population as of the data cut-off 
date (17 June2021). 
Serious Adverse Events 
No SAEs were reported in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population up to 1 month after Dose 3 
and one SAE was reported from Dose 3 to the Data cut-off date. This event was reported in a 40-49-
year-old study participant diagnosed with myocardial infarction, is described above in the section for 
Adverse Events. 
Safety-Related Participant Withdrawals 
No participants in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population were withdrawn due to AEs from 
Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (17 June 2021). 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
AEs of specific clinical interest, such as those in the FDA and CDC list of AESIs for COVID-19, were 
reviewed up to the data cut-off date (17 June 2021) and are summarized below. No cases of 
anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, Bell’s palsy, appendicitis, or myocarditis/pericarditis were reported in the 
Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster group from Dose3 to the data cut-off date. 
CHMP´s Comment: 
No events of death were reported. One event of SAE (myocardial infarction), described in the section 
above, has been reported.  
No cases of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, Bell’s palsy, appendicitis, or myocarditis/pericarditis were 
reported. However, due to the very small number of included subjects, the possibility to draw firm 
conclusion regarding the risk of less common occurring AEs/SAE is limited.

4.2.3.  Other Safety Assessments 
Severe COVID-19 Illness 
No AEs were reported that suggested any potential cases of severe COVID-19 among participants in 
the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster group, from Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (17 June 2021). 
Pregnancy 
No pregnancies were reported in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster group from Dose 3 to the data cut-off 
date (17 June2021). 
CHMP´s Comment: 
No events of severe Covid-19 illness or pregnancies were reported among the subjects included in this 
third dose subset of the phase 3 study (C4591001). 
4.3.  Discussion 
In total 312 subjects aged 18-55 years from the part of the Phase 3 study (C4591001) executed in US 
have been included in a subset that received a third dose of BNT162b2 at 30 µg ≥5 months after their 
second dose. Six individuals received a dose of BNT162b2SA by error instead of BNT162b2 30 µg, 
limiting the finally evaluated safety population to 306 subjects. Local reactions, systemic events and 
antipyretic medications were recorded in an E-diary for 7 days after administration of the third dose. 
Adverse events were recorded up to one month after the third dose and SAEs are collected up to 5-6 
months after the last dose. 305 of the subjects had a follow up of 2-4 months after the third dose. 
The distribution between gender was within similar range. A majority were overweighed or obese 
(72%). 
The most reported local reaction was pain at the injection site (83%), of which the majority were mild 
to moderate. No subjects reported Grade 4 local reaction. The most commonly systemic event was 
fatigue (64%) of which 40% were moderate or severe. Almost half of the study population (n=135) 
used antipyretic or pain medication after the third dose. These results are in line with the reported 
data after the second dose in the Phase 2/3 analysis of study C4591001. 
The MAH has further clarified, why a difference is observed between the number of included individuals 
(306) and the number of individuals that reported local reactions and systemic events (289).  
Among the 306 subjects, 44 (14%) reported any adverse events up to one month after administration 
of the third dose. AEs presented belonged specifically to the SOCs blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (PT lymphadenopathy), general disorders and administration site conditions (local and 
systemic reactogenicity) and musculoskeletal disorders. No events of death were reported. The 
incidence of lymphadenopathy was higher after the third dose compared to what was observed after 
the second dose in the Phase 2/3 analysis of study C4591001 (5.2% vs 0.4%). The MAH has proposed 
an update of the SmPC regarding increased frequency of lymphadenopathy after the third dose, which 
is endorsed. 
One event of dysgeusia “with coffee” was considered related by the physician and of mild and 
reversible (resolved after 72 days). One event of SAE (myocardial infarction) was considered not 
related to vaccination due to confounding risk factors in the medical history. 
It is noted that many individuals have received a third dose in the frame of the vaccination campaign 
in Israel. The MAH has submitted the number and type of post-marketing events that it detected in its 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/575859/2021 
Page 42/57 
 
 
 
 
safety database. Overall, no specific AE pattern is observed in the presented data that may raise a new 
safety concern. 
It can be concluded that the reactogenicity profile of the third dose is in line with the data reported 
after administration of the second dose. However, the submitted data is limited in terms of the 
numbers of vaccinees included in the study and the duration of follow up does therefore not allow any 
firm conclusions regarding the pattern and incidence of uncommon or rare AEs/SAEs.  
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to introduce 
a booster dose (third dose) of Comirnaty for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Package Leaflet 
(PL) is updated accordingly (see Attachment 1). 
6.  Request for supplementary information 
6.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  The MAH is asked to provide any available post-marketing safety information where subjects 
have received a 3rd booster dose. 
2.  Please provide information on plans for further clinical studies of a third dose in elderly (over 
55 years) and younger (i.e. below 18 years of age). 
3.  Validation reports for the neutralization assay for both WT and variant virus strains are 
requested.  
4.  The lower age limit for a third dose should be changed to 18 years in the SmPC.  
5.  A justification for the required interval of 6 months between dose 2 and 3 should be provided. 
In case the timing of the third dose could be considered more flexible the SmPC needs to be 
updated accordingly. 
6.  The MAH is asked to clarify why not all 306 subjects were included in the reactogenicity 
evaluation (n=289).

The MAH is asked to provide any available post-marketing safety information where subjects 
have received a 3rd booster dose. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Pfizer is responsible for the management of post-authorization safety data on behalf of the MAH, 
BioNTech, according to the Pharmacovigilance Agreement. Data from BioNTech are included in the 
report when applicable. 
Pfizer’s safety database contains cases of AEs reported spontaneously to Pfizer, cases reported by 
the health authorities, cases published in the medical literature, cases from Pfizer-sponsored 
marketing programs, noninterventional studies, and cases of serious AEs reported from clinical 
studies regardless of causality assessment. 
The limitations of post-marketing adverse drug event reporting should be considered when interpreting 
these data: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Reports are submitted voluntarily, and the magnitude of underreporting is unknown. Some 
of the factors that may influence whether an event is reported include: length of  time 
since marketing, market share of the drug, publicity about a drug or an AE, seriousness of 
the reaction, regulatory actions, awareness by health professionals and consumers of 
adverse drug event reporting, and litigation. 
Because many external factors influence whether or not an AE is reported, the 
spontaneous reporting system yields reporting proportions not incidence rates. As a 
result, it is generally not appropriate to make between-drug comparisons using these 
proportions; the spontaneous reporting system should be used for signal detection 
rather than hypothesis testing. 
In some reports, clinical information (such as medical history, validation of diagnosis, 
time from drug use to onset of illness, dose, and use of concomitant drugs) is missing or 
incomplete, and follow-up information may not be available. 
An accumulation of AE reports does not necessarily indicate that a particular AE was 
caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other 
factor(s) such as past medical history or concomitant medication. 
A summary of post-authorization or post-approval AE reports received by the Company, from 
19 December 2020 (earliest conditional approval date) through the DLP of 18 June 2021,1 
following a third dose of Comirnaty, is presented below. 
There was a total of 71 case reports involving patients who received 3 doses of Comirnaty 
(53 medically confirmed and 18 nonmedically confirmed), containing 174 events. Out of these 
71,  there  were  12  serious cases  of  which  1  reported  a  fatal  outcome.  All  but  one  of  these 
cases reported that the third dose was administered in a context of medication error/off-label 
use/overdose. 
Table 20 below represents the main characteristics of the 71 cases.

Table 20 – General overview of 71 cases 
The reported PTs by seriousness in the 71 cases are presented in Table 21. There are 50 cases 
coding to at-risk events without associated AEs; in the remaining 21 cases the most frequently co-
reported AEs (>2 occurrences), regardless seriousness, were Pyrexia (8), Fatigue (4), Atrial 
fibrillation and Pain in extremity (3 each).

In the 21 cases reporting AEs following the third dose administration, the interval between the 
second  and  the  third  dose  was  not  provided  in  7  cases;  in  the  remaining  14  cases,  it  was 
reported as: 
•  ≥ 0 ≤10 days: 3 cases 
•  ≥ 11 ≤ 25 days: 5 cases 
•  ≥ 26 days ≤ 112 days: 6 cases 
Out  of  71  cases  reporting  that  the  patients  received  the  third  dose,  8  referred  to 
immunocompromised patients2; 3 of these cases coded to at-risk events, without associated 
AEs; of the remaining 5 cases, all from France reporting clinical AEs, 2 were nonserious and 
3 were serious. 
• 
A case with fatal outcome (PTs: Death, Transplant rejection, Speech disorder, 
Malaise, Overdose) was reported. The available information is provided below. 
A 50-57-year-old patient received 3 doses of BNT162b2 on Day 0, Day 32 and Day 
65. Medical history included, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nonalcoholic 
liver cirrhosis and organ transplant in 2019. Concomitant medications were not 
reported but the patient had been hospitalized a few days prior for suspected acute 
organ rejection. The patient unexpectedly died 2 days after the third dose (cause of 
death was unknown). The report noted that there was no cardiovascular antecedent, 
no hypertension, no kidney damage and normal coronary angiography, and 
ultrasound (dates and details were not specified). The patient had no specific 
complaints immediately after the third dose; per the reporter the patient speech was 
a little inconsistent the day after the third dose and was not feeling well. The patient 
died 2 days after the third dose. It is unknown if an autopsy was done. Follow-up 
attempts were completed, and no further information is expected. 
MAHs comment: There is not a clear cause of death in this patient, however the recent 
hospitalisation for treatment of suspected acute rejection suggests the possibility of underlying 
pathology with respect to his transplanted organs.

• 
The second serious case (PTs: Pulmonary embolism, Off label use, Overdose) referred to a 
60-69-year-old patient with a medical history of dialysis since 2015, kidney transplant in 
2016 for toxic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, arteriovenous fistula thrombosis in 2018, 
permanent closure of the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 2019, dysmorphic liver, splenic 
nodule; small intestine angiodysplasia, obesity and renal failure with baseline creatinine 
130-150 at µM. The patient tolerated very well the first 2 doses of BNT162b2 (interval 
between the 2 doses unknown). Due to the fact that the patient was under 
immunosuppressive treatment (belatacept), the patient received a third dose (interval from 
the second dose unknown) of the vaccine. Four days later, the patient complained of 
dyspnoea (saturation =93%), and bilateral proximal pulmonary embolism was detected. 
• 
• 
• 
The third serious case (PTs: Neutropenia, Incorrect dose administered) involved a 40-49-
year-old patient with a medical history of lymphoma and chemotherapy, who received the 
third dose 85 days after the second dose. The patient experienced neutropenia with an 
unknown outcome, 6 days after the third dose. The patient had experienced neutropenia 
also after the first dose (latency and outcome unknown). 
In a nonserious case, a 60-69-year-old patient (PTs: Off label use, Inappropriate schedule 
of product administration, Vaccination site pain, Extra dose administered) with a medical 
history of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune 
disease, received a third dose of BNT162b2. After the third dose the patient experienced a 
mild pain at injection site. The outcome of the event was unknown. 
In a nonserious case, a 40-49-year-old immunocompromised patient (PTs: Haematoma, 
Peripheral swelling, Pain in extremity, Extra dose administered) with a medical history of 
orphan disease and organ transplant, experienced haematoma of foot and of closed fistula, 
swelling of foot with severe pain, 2 days  after the administration of the third dose of 
BNT162b2. The patient did not recover. 
MAH’s evaluation: The review of the cases included in the safety database did not reveal any safety 
issue. 
Among the publications on the safety information about the administration of the third dose of 
COVID-19 vaccine, a couple of papers reported information about occurrence of COVID disease 
and local/ systemic reactions after the third dose. 
Bar
On et al. published 1-month data (30 July 2021 through 31 August 2021) from the Israeli 
Ministry of Health database regarding 1,137,804 persons 60 years of age and older who had 
‑
received the third dose at least 5 months after the first 2 doses. These data were also presented 
at the VRBPAC meeting on 17 September 2021. The rates of confirmed COVID-19 and severe 
illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster (third) dose of the Comirnaty 
vaccine. 
Hause et al. reported data on third dose collected between 12 August and 19 September 2021, 
through v-safe (a voluntary, smartphone-based surveillance system) on more than 11,000 
recipients receiving Comirnaty and more than 10,000 receiving Spikevax. For both mRNA 
vaccines, local reactions were reported more frequently after third than second dose and systemic 
reactions were reported less frequently after third than second dose, but no new safety issues 
were observed. The interpretations of the results of this paper are limited by the voluntary 
enrolment, the lack of information about the immunocompromised status of the recipients, the 
Assessment report

fact that a causal relationship between a vaccine and clinically serious adverse events reported 
after vaccination cannot be established and insufficient data were available to determine patterns 
of adverse reactions after receipt of an additional dose from a manufacturer different from the 
primary series. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has given a summary of post-marketing AE reports, as collected in the MAH’s safety 
database from 19 December 2020 (earliest conditional approval date) through the DLP of 18 June 
2021, following a third dose of Comirnaty.  
A total of 71 case reports involving patients who received 3 doses of Comirnaty containing 174 
events have been received. 12 cases were serious with 1 reported fatal outcome. Almost all cases 
were labelled as medication error. 
There are 50 cases coding to at-risk events without associated AEs; in the remaining 21 cases the 
most frequently co-reported AEs (>2 occurrences), regardless seriousness, were Pyrexia (8), 
Fatigue (4), Atrial fibrillation and Pain in extremity (3 each). 
The MAH provided descriptions for 5 cases with AEs (3 serious (covering the fatal outcome), 2 non 
serious) observed in immunocompromised individuals.  
Overall, no specific AE pattern is observed in the presented data that may raise a new safety 
concern. 
Issue solved. 
Question 2 
Please provide information on plans for further clinical studies of a third dose in elderly 
(over 55 years) and younger (i.e. below 18 years of age). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Pfizer/BioNTech are currently conducting study C4591031, a Phase 3 randomized, placebo- 
controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a booster dose 
of BNT162b2 30 µg. Participants ≥16 years of age who completed a 2-dose primary series of 
BNT162b2 30 µg at least 6 months prior to randomization were enrolled and randomized at a 
ratio of 1:1 to receive either BNT162b2 30 µg or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age, 
such that approximately 60% of participants enrolled were to be ≥16 to 55 years of age and 
approximately 40% of participants >55 years of age. Approximately 10,000 participants were 
randomized in the study. 
The statistical framework employed for this study is periodic statistical summaries (planned to be 
every 2 months over the scheduled 6-month follow-up period) using statistical guidelines, rather 
than the traditional hypothesis testing framework with strong control of overall type 1 error across 
analysis time points. A descriptive statistical approach will be used with point estimates of VE 
(boosted relative to unboosted) and unadjusted (for multiplicity) 95% CIs at each time point (2, 4, 
and 6 months). In addition, to help put these results into perspective, an inferred VE for the 
unboosted group (relative to an unvaccinated population) will be calculated. Specifically, assuming 
that the newly boosted group has the same VE (relative to an unvaccinated population) over time 
that was observed in the parent C4591001 trial, an inferred unvaccinated (placebo) disease rate 
can be obtained at various time points and used to calculate the inferred VE (relative to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/575859/2021 
Page 49/57 
 
 
 
 
 
unvaccinated) for the unboosted group. The results of the first analysis at 2 months are due to be 
available in Q4 2021. Due to authorizations and recommendations for receipt of a booster dose, 
from 24 September 2021 study participants may be unblinded and receive a booster dose if they 
had been randomized to placebo. Each participant will be included in the 2-month analysis until 
they are unblinded   (if applicable). 
Study C4591031 will therefore provide safety and efficacy data for a third dose in elderly (over 
55 years) and younger (i.e. below 18 years of age) individuals. 
Further studies are being planned to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose in 
participants 12-15 years of age and participants <12 years. The first of these is currently 
planned to start in early 2022. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAHs answer is accepted. 
Issue solved. 
Question 3 
Validation reports for the neutralization assay for both WT and variant virus strains are 
requested. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
For the C4591001 booster study analyses, only the WT mNeonGreen microneutralization assay is 
validated. The plaque reduction assays (PRNT) are exploratory and do not have validation reports. 
MAH submitted validation report dated 9.02.2021.  
SYNOPSIS 
This report describes the validation of the SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralization Assay 
(SARS-CoV-2 mNG NT) used for the detection of serum antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. 
The assay readout of 50% virus neutralization titer was validated per protocol VR-MVP-10074. 
The SARS-CoV-2 mNG NT is a biofunctional assay that measures neutralizing antibodies against SARS-
CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 mNG virus is derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain that had been rescued 
by reverse genetics and engineered to contain a mNeonGreen (mNG) reporter gene in open reading 
frame 7 of the viral genome that produces green fluorescence upon productive infection of cells. This 
reporter virus generates similar plaque morphologies and indistinguishable growth curves from wild-
type virus. 
This assay is described in the test method VR-TM-10298.  
Briefly, serially diluted test serum samples are mixed with SARS-CoV-2 mNG virus in a 96-well plate to 
allow virus-specific antibodies to bind to the virus. This serum-virus mixture is then transferred onto a 
Vero cell monolayer and incubated overnight to allow for infection by non-neutralised virus. Productive 
viral infection is detected by enumerating green-fluorescent viral foci using a cell-imaging reader. The 
total number of cells per well is calculated by enumerating Vero cell nuclei stained blue with Hoechst 
33342. An infection ratio is then calculated for each well, whereby the total number of virus infected 
(green) cells is divided by the total number of cells present (blue nuclei). A sample titer is defined as

the reciprocal serum dilution at which a specific percentage of the virus is neutralised, e.g., 50%, 80% 
or 90% 
(termed “Titer Determining Value”, TDV). 
•  Based on dilutional linearity and assay precision, the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 
determined to be a titer equal to 41 and the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) was determined to 
be a titer equal to 3,187. Samples with titers greater than the ULOQ may be pre-diluted before 
testing to yield titers within the validated assay range.

Intermediate precision assessment demonstrated overall assay variability of 26.5% RSD. 
•  Serum samples are run in replicate in the SARS-CoV-2 mNG NT. Based on the assay performance, 
it was determined that the replicate titer ratio for a sample must be less than or equal to 2.55 
(sample extravariability rule). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH submitted the validation report, which evaluates the test performance using modified Wuhan 
strain of SARS-CoV-2 mNG virus. No validation report using Delta and Beta strains has been received. 
As the current application focuses on the Wuhan strain and only supportive information about Beta and 
Delta strains, the validation report is acceptable. 
The results documented in this validation report for the SARS-CoV-2 mNG NT provide evidence that 
the assay is validated and suitable for its intended use in testing clinical, epidemiological, and non-
clinical study samples. The assay demonstrated dilutional linearity and precision that met predefined 
acceptance criteria.  
The MAH’s answer is accepted. 
Issue solved. 
Question 4 
The lower age limit for a third dose should be changed to 18 years in the SmPC. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges and has accepted the relevant changes in the hereby submitted 
version of the Product Information. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response

Question 5 
A justification for the required interval of 6 months between dose 2 and 3 should be 
provided. In case the timing of the third dose could be considered more flexible the SPC 
needs to be updated accordingly.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
In the study C4591001, a booster dose of 30 μg BNT162b2 was administered in the Phase 1 
participants approximately 7 to 9 months after the primary series. The participants in the Phase 
2/3 part of the study received a booster dose with a median interval of 6.8 months post Dose 2, 
ranging from 4.8 to 8.0 months post Dose 2. 
Per protocol prespecified criteria, the immunogenicity evaluable population received the booster 
dose within a defined window of <150 days (5 months) and >210 days (7 months) after Dose 2. 
The SARS-CoV-2 neutralising GMT ratio of 1 month after Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 2 met the 
noninferiority criteria (3.29; 2-sided 97.5% CI: 2.76, 3.91). 
The immunogenicity all-evaluable population included subjects who received the booster dose 
within a broader interval of 4.8 to 8 months post Dose 2 and resulted in a comparable GMR ratio 
that similarly met the noninferiority criteria (3.11; 2-sided 97.5% CI: 2.63, 3.68) (Supplemental 
Table 14.10 in Interim Report – BNT162b2 Booster). 
Further, Phase 3 data from the C4591001 study showed that a booster (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 30 µg 
was safe and well-tolerated. 
Based on the wider than 6 months (4.8 to 8 months post Dose 2) range of the interval between 
primary vaccination series and a third booster dose in the population studied in the Phase 1 and 
Phase 2/3 part of the study C4591001 and the safety and effectiveness data obtained in this 
study, a booster (third) dose of Comirnaty may be administered intramuscularly approximately 6 
months after the second dose. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAHs answer is accepted. 
Issue solved. 
Question 6 
The MAH is asked to clarify why not all 306 subjects were included in the reactogenicity 
evaluation (n=289). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
In the Phase 3 booster population, all participants were given an e-diary to record prompted local 
reactions and systemic events on Days 1 to 7 post-Dose 3, and the reactogenicity analysis is based 
on all participants who completed the e-diary. The CSR e-diary transmission table (Table 22) shows 
17 participants (5.6%) did not have any transmitted e-diary data post-Dose 3. Hence the 
reactogenicity evaluation was only done on 289 subjects.

8.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit-risk balance 
The present submission is intended to support addition of safety and immunogenicity data after of a 
third dose of BNT162b2 into the SmPC (sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). 
The MAH has submitted immunogenicity and safety data of a third dose of BNT162b2 (30 µg) given to 
a subset of US participants in Phase 3 Study C4591001 who previously received two doses of 
BNT162b2 (30 µg). This group is comprised of approximately 300 adults 18 to 55 years of age who 
received a third dose of BNT162b2 (30 µg) approximately 6 (4.8 to 8.0) months after receipt of Dose

2, with safety and immune response evaluations at 1 month after Dose 3. Immune responses at 1 
month after Dose 3 were compared to immune responses 1 month after Dose 2. 
Supportive data were also provided from Phase 1 participants in study C4591001 (N=23) in the 
younger (18 to 55 years of age, N=11) and older (65 to 85 years of age, N=12) age groups who 
received three doses of BNT162b2 (30 µg), including neutralising serum titres against wild-type 
(reference) and VOC strains Beta and Delta of SARS-CoV-2. 
Immunogenicity  
The presented data on a third dose of BNT162b2 given at approximately 6 months after dose 2, show 
that higher neutralising titres are obtained after the third dose compared to the second dose. The 
neutralising titres had declined before the third dose was given compared to 1 month after dose 2, as 
can be expected, but were still quantifiable. It may be hypothesised that the third dose gives rise to a 
more lasting protection, and possibly also a broader coverage against viral variants with decreased 
vaccine susceptibility.  
Available data mainly pertain to adults aged 18-55 years of age. Very limited data from the phase 1 
part of study C4591001 (n=12) are available in subjects 65-85 years of age. It may be anticipated 
that elderly subjects would be in need of a booster dose within a shorter interval compared to younger 
adults, due to immune senescence with increasing age. There are no data on a third dose in subjects 
younger than 18 years of age. 
Preliminary results on neutralising antibody titres to the beta and delta variants were presented from a 
small group of subjects from the phase 1 part of the study. These showed increased titres, compared 
to one month after two doses only.  
As the efficacy evaluation is based entirely on immunogenicity data, it is crucial that the 
neutralisation assay, which was used to measure vaccine induced antibodies, is fully validated. 
In the initial submission data package, only the brief qualification report from December 2020 
was available, and no validation reports were found in the dossier although the MAH stated in 
the Clinical Overview that the method is fully validated. In addition, the neutralisation assays 
for the variant strains also need validation. Therefore, the assay validation reports were 
requested. As a response, the MAH submitted the neutralisation assay validation report dated 
at 09.02.2021, which was found to be a relevant document, that provided sufficient evidence of 
the validity of the method using modified Wuhan strain of SARS-Cov-2. This validation report 
does not contain validation of Beta and Delta variants, however as information about VOCs in 
phase 1 study was submitted as supportive data, the issue is hereby not pursued further. 
Presently, it does not seem possible to conclude on an optimal vaccination schedule to ensure long-
term protection against several variants of SARS-CoV2; e.g., there is no RCT comparing protection 
with two doses given at least 3 weeks apart and that with three doses, when the third dose given 
around 6 months after the second dose.  
The current data are obtained in a clinical trial setting where the interval between doses is relatively 
fixed. In real life, the interval between dose 1 and 2 can be considerably longer than the three weeks 
used in the pivotal trial for Comirnaty. In fact, several nations have recommended longer dose 
intervals, at least during the initial phases of the vaccination campaigns. The effect of a longer dose 
interval between dose 1 and 2 and the effect on a third dose is currently unknown. It is possible that a 
longer interval between dose 1 and 2 result in increased responses to dose 2, and thereby prolonging 
the time to waning of immunity.

In conclusion, the benefit of a third dose given at approximately 6 months after the second dose, and 
measured one month thereafter, is restoring neutralising titers to a higher level that what was seen 
one month after dose two, when this was given three weeks after dose one. 
Safety 
The safety data set constitutes of 306 subjects aged 18-55 years who received a third dose of 
BNT162b2 30 µg. Half of the subjects received their third dose 6-7 months after Dose 2 and almost 
all subjects (n=305) had a follow up of 2-4 months after the third dose. It was noted that a majority 
(72%) were overweight or obese.  
Information regarding reactogenicity was based on data reported in the E-diary of 289 subjects. The 
most commonly reported local reaction pain at the injection site (83%), of which 60% were mild and 
23% moderate. None of the subjects reported a grade 4 local reaction. The most commonly reported 
systemic event was fatigue (64%) of which 40% were moderate or severe. Almost half of the study 
population (n=135) used antipyretic or pain medication after the third dose. These results are in line 
with what was presented for the subjects aged 18-55 years that received Dose 2 in the phase 2/3 
study (C4591001). 
Among the 306 subjects, 44 (14%) reported any adverse events up to one month after 
administration of the third dose. AEs presented belonged specifically to the SOCs blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (PT lymphadenopathy), general disorders and administration site 
conditions (local and systemic reactogenicity) and musculoskeletal disorders. No deaths were 
reported. Lymphadenopathy (n=16) was the most commonly reported PT deemed related by the 
investigator. The incidence of lymphadenopathy was notably higher after the third dose compared to 
what was observed after the second dose in the Phase 2/3 study (5.2% vs 0.4%). The MAH has 
proposed an update of the SmPC regarding the increased frequency of lymphadenopathy after the 
third dose, which is supported. 
While reasonably similar reactogenicity profile compared to after the second dose, has been shown in 
subjects 18-55 years, no data are available in younger or older subjects. The safety results from dose 
1 and 2 in the large phase 3 study showed that reactogenicity and adverse events were of similar or 
lower frequency and severity in elderly subjects compared to younger adults. Based on previous 
experience and the safety results in younger adults, the safety conclusions can thus be extrapolated 
to older subjects. For subjects under 18 years of age higher reactogenicity is expected, also based on 
experience with two doses. 
The safety dataset is sufficiently large to characterise the reactogenicity of the third dose. However, 
its size does not suffice to characterise the nature and frequency of less common adverse events. 
Particularly, it is not known whether the risk for vaccine induced myo/pericarditis, which has been 
observed to be higher after the second dose compared to the first, increases further after a third 
dose. 
Available post marketing data have indicated that the risk of myo/pericarditis is higher in younger 
adults than older, and highest in young men. For adolescents, estimates of the size of this risk 
remain even more uncertain. The MAH proposed that a third dose be indicated for individuals down 
to the age of 16. However, the lack of characterisation of reactogenicity as well as considerable 
uncertainty regarding the myo/pericarditis risk in adolescents, presently preclude any indication for 
the third dose in non-adults. 
Benefit-risk discussion 
It has been shown that a third dose given approximately 6 months after the primary vaccination 
series more than restores neutralising titres in adults, compared to what was seen one month after 
Assessment report

dose two. However, as there is no serological correlate of protection, the relevance of restoring the 
waning titres is currently unknown. Notably, epidemiological data on vaccine efficacy, and the 
potential waning of the protective effect of Comirnaty against symptomatic covid-19 over time have 
not been evaluated within this procedure. Therefore, while the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of 
a third dose have been sufficiently characterised, the proper timing and impact of a third dose 
across different populations has not been established. Furthermore, the risk of more rare and serious 
side effects such as myocarditis remains uncharacterised. Consequently, the decision whether, when 
and for whom to implement a third dose of Comirnaty needs to be taken based on emerging 
epidemiological vaccine efficacy or effectiveness data in different age groups and given differing 
comorbidities, including immunosuppression. 
Based on the immunological data, it is considered that a third dose could translate into an increased 
duration of protection, and possibly increased protection against variants of concern, which provide a 
substantial potential benefit in some epidemiological situations. However, it should be noted that the 
available data does not allow to draw a definite conclusion. 
In summary, the benefit-risk of a third dose of Comirnaty in adults, given at least six months after 
the second dose, has been shown to be positive, provided that its implementation is appropriately 
guided by vaccine efficacy data supporting its utility, taking into account remaining uncertainties 
about the safety profile. The benefit-risk balance of a third dose for adolescents has not been 
demonstrated to be positive, due to lack of data. 
More information on the safety and immunogenicity of a third dose of Comirnaty will be collected in 
the remit of the ongoing C4591001 study and the MAH will submit an update to the RMP to reflect a 
third booster dose in the first half of November.

Summary 
SmPC new text 
A booster dose (third dose) of Comirnaty may be administered intramuscularly at least 6 months after 
the second dose in individuals 18 years of age and older. The decision when and for whom to 
implement a third dose of Comirnaty should be made based on available vaccine effectiveness data, 
taking into account limited safety data. The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose (third dose) 
of Comirnaty in individuals 65 years of age and older is based on safety and immunogenicity data in 
adults 18 to 55 years of age.  
The interchangeability of Comirnaty with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the primary vaccination 
course or the booster dose (third dose) has not been established. Individuals who have received 1 
dose of Comirnaty should receive a second dose of Comirnaty to complete the primary vaccination 
course and for any additional doses. 
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age, who completed the 
original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose (third dose) of Comirnaty approximately 6 
months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. The overall safety profile for the booster 
dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 
55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 
30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). %). A higher frequency of lymphadenopathy (5.2% vs 0.4%) was 
observed in participants receiving a booster dose (third dose) compared to participants receiving 2 
doses. The risk of myocarditis after a third dose of Comirnaty has not yet been characterised. 
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Comirnaty was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing 
antibody titers (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month 
after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years 
of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after 
the booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 
difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a ≥ 4-fold 
rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series).

Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Adcirca SmPC 
and update of section 5.1 of the Cialis SmPC in order 
to reflect the results of study H6D-MC-LVJJ, a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 
3 trial of tadalafil in the treatment of Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), to fulfil Adcirca P46 
019.1 and Cialis P46 045.1. In addition the MAH took 
the opportunity to update section 6.6 of the SmPC to 
remove the statement ‘no special requirements’ for 
Adcirca and Cialis and to add the standard statement 
about disposal of any unused or waste material for 
Cialis, and to align annex II.C with the latest QRD

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add a 
new warning on the risk of acute non-arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) based on 
the results of observational study NCT00759174 and 
MAH conducted observational study H6D-MC-LVHQ 
(NCT0113110, a category 3 study in the RMP), 
looking at an association between the intermittent 
use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 inhibitors and 
the risk of acute NAION. The RMP (version 8.1) is 
updated accordingly. In addition the Worksharing 
applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to align the 
Package Leaflet with the SmPC of Adcirca and Cialis 
regarding the adverse drug reaction (ADR) ‘priapism’ 
and of Cialis only for the ADR ‘prolonged erection’, to 
make corrections in the German annexes and to 
align the product information with the latest QRD 
template version 10. The Icelandic and the 
Norwegian CHMP members agree with the above-
mentioned recommendation of the CHMP on variation 
to the terms of the marketing authorisation.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add 
the terms haematuria, haematospermia and penile 
haemorrhage at a frequency of uncommon for both 
Cialis and Adcirca. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. This variation was requested by the 
CHMP following a class review of cumulative data on 
urogential bleeding in relation to PDE-5 inhibitors.

penile haemorrhage and haematospermia following the use 
of sildenafil when monitoring the EudraVigilance database. 
After an initial discussion of this signal, the 
Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) requested all 
MAHs of PDE-5 inhibitors to submit a cumulative overview 
of the adverse event (AE) terms penile haemorrhage, 
haematospermia, haematuria and penile hematoma and a 
discussion on background incidence, and possible 
mechanisms, including a possible effect on platelet 
function, time relations, long term outcome, overdose, the 
potential for confounding, and the possibility of a 
pharmacological class effect. After having assessed this 
cumulative review the CHMP concluded that genitourinary 
bleeding events should be considered a class effect shared 
by all PDE-5 inhibitors. In response to the request from the 
CHMP the MAH submitted this type II variation to include 
haematuria, haematospermia and penile haemorrhage in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency of uncommon for 
both Adcirca and Cialis. The package leaflet was updated 
accordingly. Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line

SmPC and PL 
During the reporting periods for PSUR 11 there was a 
PSUR 11, the section 4.4 of the SmPC with regard to 
the concomitant use with other PDE5 inhibitors has 
been amended. 
Following conclusions from the assessment of RMP 
version 4, the section 4.8 of the SmPC with regard to 
frequencies of adverse drug reactions and section 4 
of the PL were amended accordingly.  
The fifth level of the ATC code has been added in 
section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties. 
Furthermore, the SmPC is updated in line with the 
revised SmPC Guideline (sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, 
4.8, 5.1). Revisions to the list of local 
representatives in the PL were also made. 
spontaneous report of deafness (PT) in a patient who was 
taking tadalafil concomitantly with another PDE5 inhibitor, 
sildenafil. Sudden hearing loss has been identified as an 
event of potential risk in association with all PDE5 
inhibitors, despite the absence of a postulated probable 
mechanism for a role of PDE5 inhibitors in the occurrence 
of this event. Hence, "PDE5 Inhibitors" has been added to 
the statement that discusses concomitant use of tadalafil 
with other treatments for erectile dysfunction in the section 
4.4 of the SmPC. 
The frequencies of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 
Section 4.8 have been updated based on an analysis of the 
results of 36 placebo-controlled clinical trials on erectile 
dysfunction in the currently approved indication and 
dosage. This update also addresses that during the 
reporting of RMP version 4 a higher incidence of sudden

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC based on 
the results of four clinical pharmacology studies 
which evaluated the interaction between tadalafil and 
various alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agents. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
studies which evaluated the interaction between tadalafil 
(TDF) and three  -adrenergic antagonists (doxazosin, 
tamsulosin and alfuzosin):  
Two studies evaluated the effects on blood pressure of 
doxazosin in combination with tadalafil. One study 
evaluated the interaction between three different dosing 
regimens of a single dose of 20 mg TDF and doxasozin 4 
mg or 8 mg daily. Another study included TDF 5 mg and 
concomitant increasing doses of doxazosin up to 4 mg 
daily. 
A third study evaluated the effects on blood pressure with 
the coadministration of alfuzosin 10 mg and a single dose 
of tadalafil 20 mg. 
Finally, another study evaluated the effects on blood 
pressure of a single dose of tamusolin 0.4 mg in 
combination with tadalafil 5 mg daily. 
These studies showed that in patients who are taking alpha 
blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead 
to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. When 
taldalafil is co-administered with doxazosin, hypotension 
lasts at least twelve hours, may be symptomatic, including 
syncope. Therefore this combination is not recommended. 
Hypotension was not reported with alfuzosin or tamsulosin, 
although, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil

in patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in

this information is unknown and the other two experienced 
seizures the second day after the last tadalafil dose), 
strongly suggesting a causal relationship. Additionally, 
twenty-four post-marketing reports of amnesia were 
identified. Some of these patients had other risk factors. 
However, the CHMP considered that temporal sequence in 
the other patients strongly suggested  a causal relationship. 
Overall, the CHMP considered that these data supported 
the inclusion of 'seizures' and transient amnesia' in section 
4.8 of the SPC. The Package Leaflet was amended

granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Cialis remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored due to the limited use of the new treatment 
scheme of Cialis 2.5 and 5 mg to be taken once daily.  
Based upon the safety profile of Cialis, which requires the 
submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the 
MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 
years time.

factors, the close temporal relationship and the 
reoccurrence of epistaxis strongly suggest a causal 
relationship. The MAH was requested to submit a type II 
variation to include epistaxis in the SPC section 4.8 of 
tadalafil (TDF).The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
also took the opportunity to review all cases of migraine 
reported in association with TDF use in PSURs 5/6. There 
were several cases reported by health care professionals 
plus cases from consumers. Two cases were reported as 
migraine without aura, one case as migraine with aura, and 
the remaining  were reported as migraine. Two of the cases 
were considered serious. In some of the cases the 
diagnosis of migraine was supported by additional reported 
events (aphasia, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbance, 
ocular headache, dysesthesia, paresthesia). Section 4.8 
was therefore updated following CHMP evaluation.

in other parameters such as motility, morphology and FSH. 
In the study of 10 mg CIALIS for 6 months and the study of 
20 mg CIALIS for 9 months, results showed a decrease in 
mean sperm concentrations relative to placebo. This effect 
was not seen in the study where the higher dose of 20 mg. 
CIALIS was taken daily for 6 months. In the 9-month 
study, decreases in sperm concentration were associated 
with higher ejaculatory frequency. Ejaculation frequency 
was not assessed in the 6-month studies. In addition there

In the context of the ongoing evaluation of the NAION issue 
of Product Characteristics (SPC) section 4.3 
(Contraindications) to include a statement that PDE5 
inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with a 
previous episode of Non-arteritic anterior ischemic 
optic neuropathy (NAION).  
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product

information with regard to non-arteritic anterior

sections of the Package Leaflet are updated 
(see II-20) and considering the data available and new

causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitors and NAION. 
The CHMP agreed with the proposal to contraindicate the 
use of PDE5 inhibitors in patients with a previous episode of 
NAION as a class labelling and to continue investigating this 
issue.   
Therefore, section 4.3 of the SPC has been updated to

disease. It is a vascular event that is presumed to occur 
due to a decrease in blood flow to the small penetrating 
arteries that supply the optic nerve as it enters the eyeball 
or globe. In NAION vascular disease and arteriolosclerosis 
are assumed to cause infarction of the short posterior 
ciliary arteries supplying the anterior optic nerve. NAION is 
the most common acute optic nerve disease in adults over 
age 50. Reported incidence rates range from 
2.5/100,000/year in adults over 50 from two counties in 
the U.S. (Johnson et al., 1994) to a rate adjusted for age 
and sex distribution of 10.2/100,000 (95% CI: 6.5-15.6) 
from the Ohmstead County study (Hattenhauer, 1997). 
Although the aetiology of NAION is unknown, many of its 
risk factors are similar to those for erectile dysfunction such 
as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, 
Page 20/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and increased age 
(Hayreh, 1995). 
NAION has been an issue of concern with PDE5 inhibitors. 
However, the fact that some of the risk factors for NAION 
are likely to be present in the population exposed to these 
drugs have made difficult to draw any firm conclusion 
about the association. Pomeranz et al (2005) describe 
seven patients, aged between 50 and 69 years, who had 
typical features of NAION within 36 hours after ingestion of 
PDE5 inhibitors.  
Other articles describe cases of NAION after use of PDE5 
inhibitors. Articles by Pomeranz et al (2002), Egan et al 
(2000), Boshier et al (2002), Cunningham et al (2001) and 
Gruhn et al (2005) describe additional 9 cases. However, 
these cases do not clarify whether the association is 
causally related. There is an additional publication by Dheer 
et al (2002). 
The CHMP conducted a review of cases of NAION for all 
authorisied PDE5 inhibitors.Although the reporting rate of 
NAION for the PDE5 inhibitors is below the background 
incidence of NAION in the general population older than 50 
years of age, the temporal s

but no cases of syncope were reported. The combination of 
tadalafil and alpha blockers is therefore not recommended. 
Information on the interaction between tadalafil and alpha 
blockers has been added to section 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.  
A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg 
daily), increased tadalafil (10-mg dose) exposure (AUC) 2-
fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax 
values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) 
increased tadalafil (20-mg dose) exposure (AUC) 4-fold and 
Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg dose 
given twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20-mg dose) 
exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax. This 
information was added to section 4.5 of the SPC and a 
warning was added to section 4.4 recommending caution to 
be exercised when prescribing Cialis to patients using 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole and erythromicin). 
Section 4.5 had been updated to include information on 
coadministration of tadalafil 20 mg and warfarin and of 
tadalafil 20 mg and aspirin. 
Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 
subjects receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days 
and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at

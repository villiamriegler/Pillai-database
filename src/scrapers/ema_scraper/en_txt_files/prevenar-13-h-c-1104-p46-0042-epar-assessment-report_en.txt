6096A-3016;  FINAL  REPORT:  PILOT:  Characterization  of  the  Prevnar  Infant  Long-Term  Immune 
Response Versus a Prevnar-Naive Cohort  
  Description 
Study  6096A1-3016  is  part  of  the  global  clinical  development  program  for  the  use  of  Prevenar  13  in 
infants  and  children.  Study  6096A1-3016  was  conducted  in  United  States  in  subjects  who  were 
originally  enrolled  in  the  pivotal  phase  3  safety,  immunogenicity,  and  efficacy  study  for  7vPnC 
(protocol  D118-P8).  Subjects  in  the  study  6096A1-3016  were  11  to  14  years  of  age  at  the  time  of 
vaccination. This study was designed to characterize the “late” immune response to an additional dose 
of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnC) more than 10 years after primary vaccination with 7vPnC in 
infancy versus a 7vPnC-naïve cohort. 
  Methods 
  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  characterize  the  “late”  immune  response  to  an  additional 
dose  of  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  more  than  10  years  after  primary  vaccination  with  7-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) in infancy versus a 7vPnCnaïve cohort. 
The  exploratory  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  kinetics  of  secondary  immune  responses  in 
order to measure serotype-specific anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and opsonophagocytic 
assay (OPA) titer. 
The  safety  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine 
(13vPnC)  as  measured  by  the  rate  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  adverse  events  (AEs),  and 
solicited local reactions and systemic events in the 2 groups. 
  Study design 
This was a single-center open-label, nonrandomized study in which all children received a single dose 
of 13vPnC.

  Study population /Sample size 
Children  were  recruited  based  on  their  prior  participation  in  a  pneumococcal  conjugate  versus 
meningococcal C conjugate (MnCC) clinical study conducted at Northern California Kaiser Permanente 
(NCKP)  in  California,  United  States,  between  1995  and  1998  (protocol  D118-P8).  More  than  38,000 
subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  original  study  and  were  randomized  to  receive  a  primary  series  of  the 
Wyeth  investigational  7vPnC  (now  licensed  and  marketed  in  the  United  States  as  Prevnar)  or  MnCC 
(now licensed and marketed outside the United States as Meningitec) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months 
of  age.  Subjects  from  both  vaccine  groups  were  recruited  in  the  current  study  to  return  to  receive  a 
single dose of 13vPnC at visit 1. 
A  sufficient  number  of  subjects  (approximately  75)  was  to  be  enrolled  within  6  months  to  ensure  at 
least 50 evaluable subjects (25 per group): 
  25  fully  vaccinated  per-protocol  subjects  (4  doses  of  vaccine  given  at  2,  4,  6,  and  12  to  15 
months of age) originally enrolled in the 7vPnC group of the study, and 
  25  fully  vaccinated  per-protocol  subjects  originally  enrolled  in  the  control  group  of  the  study 
(who received MnCC) who did not receive 7vPnC after the close of the study. 
 
Treatments 
All subjects received a single dose of Prevenar 13. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Blood samples (approximately 30 mL total, 10 mL each at visits 1, 4, and 5) were collected from every 
subject prior to vaccination, on day 7 to 10, and on day 28 to 42 after vaccination. 
Serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 
6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in all subjects for each blood sample using a 
standardized ELISA and expressed as μg/mL.  
Serotype  specific  opsonophagocytic  activity  was  determined  using  a  modified  microcolony 
opsonophagocytic assay (mcOPA) and expressed as a titer.  
The  co-primary  endpoints  specified  in  the  protocol  were  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a 
serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL by ELISA and the proportion of subjects achieving a 
titer  ≥1:8  by  OPA  for  each  of  the  pneumococcal  serotypes  at  visit  5  (28  to  42  days  after  vaccine 
administration).  These  endpoints  were  selected  based  on  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) 
guideline for evaluation of pneumococcal serotypes. 
However, based on the use of the microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay instead of the planned dribble OPA 
(dOAP)  assay,  an  OPA  responder  was  defined  as  a  subject  with  an  OPA  titer  ≥lower  limit  of 
quantitation  (LLOQ).  Analyses  using  an  OPA  ≥1:8  were  also  reported.  In  addition,  the  proportion  of 
subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥1.0 μg/mL by ELISA was calculated. 
  Statistical Methods 
For each serotype, exact, unconditional, 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the proportions of 
subjects  achieving  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL,  OPA  titers  ≥1:8,  IgG  concentration  ≥1.0  μg/mL 
and OPA titers ≥LLOQ were calculated. To assess treatment differences, exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 
95% CIs on the difference in proportions (7vPnC/13vPnC – MnCC/13vPnC) were calculated. 
Within  each  vaccine  group  and  for  each  antibody  concentration  or  titer,  geometric  mean 
concentrations/titers  (GMCs/GMTs)  were  calculated.  Each  concentration/titer  was  logarithmically 
transformed for analysis. Two (2)-sided, 95% CIs were  constructed  by  back  transformation of the CI 
for  the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results  computed  using  the  Student  t 
distribution.  The  geometric  mean 
concentration/titers 
rises 
(postvaccination/prevaccination) were summarized  by geometric means and 95% CIs, also computed 
using  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results.  To  assess  differences  between  the  2  vaccine 
groups, 2-sided, 95% CIs for the ratio [(7vPnC/13vPnC)/(MnCC/13vPnC)] of the GMCs and the GMTs 
were  constructed.  In  addition,  the  ratio  of  the  GMFRs  and  corresponding  2-sided,  95%  CIs  were 
calculated.  The  CIs  were  computed  using  the  Student  t  distribution  for  the  mean  difference  of  the 
measures on the logarithmic scale (7vPnC/13vPnC relative to MnCC/13vPnC).

Reverse  cumulative  distribution  curves  (RCDCs)  were  presented  graphically  by  vaccination  group  for 
each serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG concentration and OPA titer before and after vaccination. 
The kinetics of the immune response were described by graphical representations of summary values 
over time for the immunogenicity endpoints. 
The safety variables were AEs, local reactions, systemic events including fever, and vital signs. Fever 
was defined as an oral temperature ≥38.0°C (100.4°F). The proportion of subjects with local reactions 
and systemic events reported on any day within the 4-day period after vaccination was summarized for 
each type of event. Use of antipyretic medication was reported with systemic  events, but these  were 
analyzed separately. 
AEs  were  categorized  according to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA)  and the 
incidence of each type of event (MedDRA preferred term) was summarized.  
Comparisons  between  the  vaccine  groups  were  performed  using  a  2-sided  Fisher’s  exact  test.  All 
summaries  show  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  at  least  1  event  and  the  number  of 
events. Additional summaries by AE severity or by vaccine relationship were also produced. 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of  the  75  enrolled  subjects,  74  (98.7%)  subjects  were  included  in  the  all-available  immunogenicity 
population  and  73  (97.3%)  subjects  were  included  in  both  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population 
and the evaluable kinetic population. 
One  (1)  subject  (1.3%)  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group  did  not  receive  the  13vPnC  vaccination  and  was 
excluded  from  the  all-available  immunogenicity  population  because  no  assay  results  for  any 
pneumococcal  serotypes  were  available.  Two  (2)  subjects  (2.7%)  were  excluded  from  both  the 
evaluable immunogenicity population and the evaluable kinetic population: 1 subject was not in the all-
available  immunogenicity  population  (above  mentioned  subject),  and  1  subject  received  prohibited 
concomitant vaccines.  
 
Efficacy results 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving IgG Concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL 
The proportions of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population achieving a pneumococcal IgG 
concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  before  vaccination  with  13vPnC  (visit  1)  were  generally  similar  for  the 
assessed  serotypes  between  the  2  groups  and  greater  than  or  equal  to  62.9%  with  the  exception  of 
serotype 4 (≥28.0%). 
For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, the  proportion  of subjects achieving IgG concentrations ≥0.35 
μg/mL at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after 13vPnC) was 100% for each serotype in both vaccine groups of 
the evaluable immunogenicity population, except for serotype 14 (97.1%) in the MnCC/13vPnC group 
(Table 9-3). 
For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC the proportion of responders in both groups 
was 100% except for serotype 3 (94.7% and 97.0% in the 7vPnC/13vPnC and MnCC/13vPnC groups, 
respectively; Table 9-3). 
Results for the all-available immunogenicity population  were  overall  similar to those  observed for the 
evaluable immunogenicity population.

Proportion of Subjects Achieving OPA Titers ≥LLOQ 
The  proportions  of  subjects  in  the evaluable  immunogenicity  population  achieving  pneumococcal  OPA 
titers ≥LLOQ before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1) were generally similar for the 2 groups. For the 7 
serotypes present in 7vPnC, the proportion of subjects achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ ranged from 21.4% 
(serotype 23F) to 90.6% (serotype 6B). For the 6 additional serotypes included in 13vPnC but not in 
7vPnC, the proportion of responders ranged from 2.8% (serotype 5) to 72.7% (serotype 19A). 
For  the  7  serotypes  present  in  7vPnC,  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity 
population achieving OPA titers ≥LLOQ at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after vaccination) was 100% for each 
serotype in both vaccine groups except for serotype 19F (Table 9-4). 
For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, 100% of subjects in both groups achieved 
OPA titers ≥LLOQ for each serotype, with the exception of serotype 1, serotype 5 and serotype 19A.  
Results for the all-available immunogenicity  population were  overall  similar  to those  observed for the 
evaluable immunogenicity population.

IgG Concentrations ≥1.0 μg/mL 
The  proportions  of  subjects  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  achieving  pneumococcal  IgG 
concentrations ≥1.0 μg/mL before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1) were generally similar between the 
2 groups and greater than or equal to 31.6% with the exception of serotype 4 (≥16.0%).  
For  the  7  serotypes  present  in  7vPnC,  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  IgG  concentrations  ≥1.0 
μg/mL at visit 5 (28 to 42 days after 13vPnC) was 100% for each serotype in both vaccine groups of 
the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population,  except  for  serotype  9V,  serotype  14  and  serotype  18C; 
(Table 9-5). 
For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC the proportion of responders in both groups 
was  100%  for  each  serotype  except  for  serotype  1,  serotype  3  (81.6%  and  66.7%  in  the 
7vPnC/13vPnC and MnCC/13vPnC groups, respectively), serotype 5 and serotype 7F (Table 9-5). None 
of the differences between the 2 groups were considered clinically relevant. 
Results for the all-available immunogenicity population  were  overall  similar to those  observed for the 
evaluable immunogenicity population.

IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations 
Before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1), IgG GMCs in the evaluable immunogenicity population for all 
13 serotypes were generally similar for the 2 vaccine groups (Table 9-7).  
For  the  7  serotypes  present  in  7vPnC,  IgG  GMCs  at  visit  5  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  ranged  from 
5.72  μg/mL  (serotype  18C)  to  66.72  μg/mL  (serotype  6B;  Table  9-6).  In  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group, 
GMCs  ranged  from  2.92  μg/mL  (serotype  4)  to  22.62  μg/mL  (serotype  6B).  The  GMC  ratios 
(7vPnC/13vPnC  to  MnCC/13vPnC)  ranged  from  0.63  (serotype  18C)  to  2.95  (serotype  6B)  and  were 
>1.0 for 4 of the 7 serotypes; the lower limit of the 95% CI was >1.0 for serotypes 4, 6B, 9V and 14. 
For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, the GMCs were generally similar between 
the  2  vaccine  groups.  In  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  GMCs  ranged  from  2.13  μg/mL  (serotype  3)  to 
29.11 μg/mL (serotype 6A). In the MnCC/13vPnC group, GMCs ranged from 1.71 μg/mL (serotype 3) 
to  20.17  μg/mL  (for  serotype  19A).  The  GMC  ratios  (7vPnC/13vPnC  to  MnCC/13vPnC)  ranged  from 
0.90  (serotype  5)  to  1.81  (serotype  6A);  the  95%  CIs  included  1.0  for  all  serotypes  except  for 
serotype 7F where the lower limit was >1.0. 
Table  9-7  presents  the  pneumococcal  IgG  GMFRs  from  predose  to  visit  5  (28  through  42  days  after 
13vPnC)  for  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population.  For  all  serotypes,  the  GMCs  increased  from 
predose to Visit 5. 
Results for the all-available immunogenicity population  were  overall  similar to those  observed for the 
evaluable immunogenicity population.

OPA Geometric Mean Titers 
Before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 1), OPA GMTs in the evaluable immunogenicity population for all 
13  serotypes  were,  with  some  exceptions,  generally  similar  between  the  2  vaccine  groups  (Table  9-
11).  For  the  7  serotypes  present  in  7vPnC,  the  GMT  ratios  (7vPnC/13vPnC  to  MnCC/13vPnC)  ranged 
from 0.3 (serotype 9V) to 7.4 (serotype 23F).  
For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC the GMT ratios ranged from 0.7 (serotypes 
6A and 7F) to 1.9 (serotype 19A). 
For the 7 serotypes present in 7vPnC, OPA GMTs at visit 5 were also generally similar in the 2 vaccine 
groups  (Table  9-10).  The  GMT  ratios  (7vPnC/13vPnC  to  MnCC/13vPnC)  ranged  from  0.6  (serotypes 
19F  and  23F)  to  1.1  (serotype  6B).  The  upper  limit  of  95%  CI  was  <1.0  for  serotype  23F;  all  other 
95% CIs for the ratios included 1.0. 
For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC but not in 7vPnC, the GMTs were also generally similar for the 
2 vaccine groups. The GMT ratios (7vPnC/13vPnC to MnCC/13vPnC) ranged from 0.9 (serotypes 5, 6A 
and 19A) to 1.3 (serotype 1); the 95% CIs for the ratios included 1.0 for all serotypes. 
Results for the all-available immunogenicity population  were  overall  similar to those  observed for the 
evaluable immunogenicity population.

Table 9-11 presents a summary of the pneumococcal OPA GMFRs from predose to visit 5 (28 through 
42  days  after  13vPnC)  for  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population.  For  all  serotypes,  the  GMTs 
increased from predose to Visit 5.

Kinetics 
IgG Geometric Mean Concentrations 
IgG concentrations over time for each of the serotypes in 13vPnC before vaccination with 13vPnC (visit 
1)  and  after  vaccination  at  visits  4  and  5  were  presented  for  the  evaluable  kinetic  population. 
Representative examples ar shown in Figures 16-27 and 16-29.  
The pneumococcal IgG GMCs in the evaluable kinetic population  at  the  prevaccination visit  1  and the 
postvaccination visits 4 and 5 are summarized in Table 9-14. 
For all the 13 serotypes, GMCs increased from visit 1 to visit 4, and further increased to visit 5 in both 
vaccine groups.

OPA GMTs over time for each of the serotypes in 13vPnC at visit 1 and after vaccination at visits 4 and 
5 were presented for the evaluable kinetic population. Representative examples are shown in Figures 
16.40  and  16.42.  The  pneumococcal  OPA  GMTs  in  the  evaluable  kinetic  population  at  the 
prevaccination visit 1 and the postvaccination visits 4 and 5 are summarized in Table 9-15. 
In general, GMTs increased in both vaccine groups over time, the exception being serotypes 3, 4 and 
9V  for  both  vaccine  groups,  serotype  18C  for  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  serotype  1  for  the 
MnCC/13vPnC group.

  Safety results 
Safety  was  evaluated  by  the  incidence  of  reactogenicity,  adverse  events  (AEs),  and  serious  adverse 
events (SAEs). The safety population (n=74) included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the 
study vaccine (38 in the 7vPnC/13vPnC and 36 in the MnCC/13vPnC groups). 
Reactogenicity  (local  reactions  included  redness,  swelling,  and  tenderness  at  the  site  of  the  injection 
and  systemic  events  included  decreased  appetite,  irritability,  increased  sleep,  decreased  sleep,  rash, 
fever, and use of antipyretic medications) were monitored daily for 4 days after vaccination. AEs and 
SAEs were collected for all subjects from the day of consent until the last visit (6-month follow-up). 
Local Reactions 
A total of 92.1% (n=35) of subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group and 86.1% (n=31) of subjects in the 
MnCC/13vPnC group reported at least 1 local  reaction during the 4 days after vaccination. Generally, 
the percentages of subjects with any local reactions were similar in both groups. Local reactions were 
mostly mild or moderate in severity. 
The  most  frequently  reported  local  reaction  was  tenderness;  92.1%  (n=35)  of  subjects  in  the 
7vPnC/13vPnC group and 86.1% (n=31) of subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group. 
Significant tenderness (ie, interfered with limb movement) was reported by 4 (10.5%) subjects in the 
7vPnC/13vPnC group and 7 (19.4%) subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group. 
Systemic Events 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  1  or  more  systemic  events  was  38.9%  (n=14)  in  the 
7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  42.9%  (n=15)  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group.  The  percentages  of  subjects 
reporting  any  individual  systemic  event  were  generally  similar  between  the  2  groups  except  for 
decreased  appetite  (7.9%  [n=3]  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  16.7%  [n=6]  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC 
group).  The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  events  were  increased  sleep  (26.3%  [n=10])  and 
irritability  (18.4%  [n=7])  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  and  increased  sleep  (33.3%  [n=12])  and 
decreased  appetite  (16.7%  [n=6])  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC  group.  Most  subjects  did  not  report  fever. 
Fever  was  reported  in  1  (2.9%)  subject  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  only;  this  was  mild  (≥38°C  but 
≤39°C)  in  severity.  Overall,  most  subjects  did  not  receive  antipyretic  medication  to  treat  or  prevent 
symptoms. Medication was used to treat symptoms in  3 (7.9%) subjects in the 7vPnC/13vPnC group 
only; no subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group used medication to treat symptoms. None of the subjects 
in either group used medication to prevent symptoms. 
Adverse Events 
At  least  1  AE  was  reported  in  57.9%  (n=22)  of  subjects  in  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group  and  55.6% 
(n=20) of subjects in the MnCC/13vPnC group. Nearly all AEs reported were characterized as mild or 
moderate in severity; 1 AE (increased sleep) was assessed as severe. This event started on day 2 as 
moderate,  then  severe  on  day  3,  and  mild  on  days  4  to  6.  In  the  7vPnC/13vPnC  group,  the  system 
organ  classes  most  frequently  reported  were  “general  and  administration  site  disorders”  and 
“respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders”  (each  21.1%,  n=8)  whereas  in  the  MnCC/13vPnC 
group,  “injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications”  and  “nervous  system  disorders”  were  most 
frequently reported (22.2%, n=8 and 16.7%, n=6, respectively). 
  MAH’s conclusions 
A  single  dose  of  13vPnC  was  immunogenic  in  children  aged  11  to  14  years,  regardless  of  previous 
vaccination with 7vPnC or MnCC. 
A subsequent childhood dose of 13vPnC showed a satisfactory safety and tolerability profile in subjects 
who were vaccinated with a primary series of 7vPnC or MnCC. 
The  data  presented  here  add  to  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  database  for  this  vaccine  in  older 
children, and do not change the risk-benefit assessment for Prevenar 13. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The current study presents results of a single dose of Prevenar 13 in subjects 11-14 years of age who 
received  either  Prevenar  or  a  MnCC  vaccine  as  infants.  The  results  show  that  the  vaccine  is  clearly 
immunogenic  in  both  groups,  and  there  were  no  major  difference  between  the  groups.  The  study 
population,  healthy  children  11-14  years,  is  not  currently  included  in  the  indication  for  Prevenar  13,

but  is  generally  not  considered  a  risk  group  for  pneumococcal  infections,  and  therefore  is  not 
considered  to  benefit  from  vaccination.  No  safety  issues  were  detected  in  this  study.  However,  two 
questions regarding the lack of difference between the immune responses between the two groups are 
raised that needs clarification before the procedure can be considered fulfilled.  
III.  RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The data provided indicate that the vaccine is clearly immunogenic in both groups, but , two questions 
regarding  the  lack  of  difference  between  the  immune  responses  between  the  two  groups  are  raised 
that needs clarification before the procedure can be considered fulfilled. 
  Recommendation  
Fulfilled:  
No further action required 
Not fulfilled: X 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide responses to the questions below as part of this 
procedure P46 042. (see section IV “Additional clarifications requested”). 
IV. 
ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide responses to the questions below as part of this 
procedure P46 041. 
Question 1: With regard to the pre-challenge serological data: From the supportive tables (Section 15, 
tables  12/15,  23/25,  41/43)  it  appears  that  OPA  antibody  titres  and  GMTs  are  very  similar  between 
both groups on visit 1 (prior to vaccination), except for serotypes 6B, 18C and 23F. For the latter three 
the  7vPnC  group  consistently  shows  better  protective  values.  The  company  is  asked  to  comment  on 
this and on the fact that there is no apparent difference  in protection between groups with regard to 
the serotypes 4, 9V, 14 and 19F. 
Question 2: There appears very little difference in quality and quantity of the immune response upon 
vaccination of both groups with Prevenar 13. The company is asked to comment on the apparent lack 
of anamnestic response, with regard to the 7vPnC serotypes, upon vaccination of the 7vPnC group with 
Prevenar 13. 
The timetable as proposed by the Rapporteur is as follows: 
 a 30 day response timetable without clock stop will apply.

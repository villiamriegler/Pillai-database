Annex II and PL  The benefit/risk profile of Ammonaps remains favourable. 
After having re-assessed the data submitted by the MAH the 
CPMP recommended that the Community Marketing 
Authorisation under exceptional circumstances should be 
lifted, as there were no remaining chemical/pharmaceutical 
and clinical Specific Obligations to be fulfilled.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
information on overdose: One case of overdose occurred in a 
5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g 
(1370 mg/kg). He developed diarrhoea, irritability, metabolic 
acidosis with hypokalaemia and recovered within 48 hours

after symptomatic treatment. These symptoms are 
consistent with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which 
showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity when administered 
intravenously at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Manifestations 
were predominantly somnolence, fatigue and 
light-headedness; less frequent were: confusion, headache, 
dysgeusia, hypacusis, disorientation, impaired memory and 
exacerbation of a pre-existing neuropathy.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tolvaptan is indicated in adults for the treatment of hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of 
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Due to the need for a dose titration phase with close monitoring of serum sodium and volume status 
(see section 4.4), treatment with tolvaptan has to be initiated in hospital. 
Posology 
Tolvaptan has to be initiated at a dose of 15 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum 
of 60 mg once daily as tolerated to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. 
For patients at risk of overly rapid correction of sodium e.g., patients with oncological conditions, very 
low baseline serum sodium, taking diuretics, or taking sodium supplementation a dose of 7.5 mg 
should be considered (see section 4.4). 
During titration, patients must be monitored for serum sodium and volume status (see section 4.4). In 
case of inadequate improvement in serum sodium levels, other treatment options have to be 
considered, either in place of or in addition to tolvaptan. Use of tolvaptan in combination with other 
options may increase the risk of overly rapid correction of serum sodium (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
For patients with an appropriate increase in serum sodium, the underlying disease and serum sodium 
levels must be monitored at regular intervals to evaluate further need of tolvaptan treatment. In the 
setting of hyponatremia, the treatment duration is determined by the underlying disease and its 
treatment. Tolvaptan treatment is expected to last until the underlying disease is adequately treated or 
until such time that hyponatremia is no longer a clinical issue. 
Tolvaptan must not be taken with grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Tolvaptan is contraindicated in anuric patients (see section 4.3). 
Tolvaptan has not been studied in patients with severe renal failure. The efficacy and safety in this 
population is not well established. 
Based on the data available, no dose adjustment is required in those with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No information is available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). In these 
patients dosing has to be managed cautiously and electrolytes and volume status must be monitored 
(see section 4.4). No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh classes A and B). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of tolvaptan in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not yet 
been established. Tolvaptan is not recommended in the paediatric age group. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Administration preferably in the morning, without regard to meals. Tablets must be swallowed without 
chewing with a glass of water.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Urgent need to raise serum sodium acutely 
Tolvaptan has not been studied in a setting of urgent need to raise serum sodium acutely. For such 
patients, alternative treatment has to be considered. 
Access to water 
Tolvaptan may cause adverse reactions related to water loss such as thirst, dry mouth and dehydration 
(see section 4.8). Therefore, patients must have access to water and be able to drink sufficient amounts 
of water. If fluid restricted patients are treated with tolvaptan, extra caution has to be exercised to 
ensure that patients do not become overly dehydrated. 
Dehydration 
Volume status must be monitored in patients taking tolvaptan because treatment with tolvaptan may 
result in severe dehydration, which constitutes a risk factor for renal dysfunction. If dehydration 
becomes evident, take appropriate action which may include the need to interrupt or reduce the dose of 
tolvaptan and increase fluid intake. 
Urinary outflow obstruction 
Urinary output must be secured. Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example 
patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing 
acute retention. 
Fluid and electrolyte balance 
Fluid and electrolyte status has to be monitored in all patients and particularly in those with renal and 
hepatic impairment. Administration of tolvaptan may cause too rapid increases in serum sodium (
≥ 12 mmol/L per 24 hours, please see below); therefore, monitoring of serum sodium in all patients 
must start no later than 4 to 6 hours after treatment initiation. During the first 1 to 2 days and until the 
tolvaptan dose is stabilised serum sodium and volume status must be monitored at least every 6 hours. 
Too rapid correction of serum sodium 
Patients with very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too rapid 
correction of serum sodium. 
Too rapid correction of hyponatremia (increase ≥ 12 mmol/L/24 hours) can cause osmotic 
demyelination resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic 
quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. Therefore, after initiation of treatment, patients have to be 
closely monitored for serum sodium and volume status (see above). 
In order to minimise the risk of too rapid correction of hyponatremia the increase of serum sodium 
should be less than 10 mmol/L/24 hours to 12 mmol/L/24 hours and less than 18 mmol/L/48 hours. 
Therefore, more precautionary limits apply during the early treatment phase. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If sodium correction exceeds 6 mmol/L during the first 6 hours of administration or 8 mmol/L during 
the first 6 to 12 hours, respectively, the possibility that serum sodium correction may be overly rapid 
should be considered. These patients should be monitored more frequently regarding their serum 
sodium and administration of hypotonic fluid is recommended. In case serum sodium increases 
≥ 12 mmol/L within 24 hours or ≥ 18 mmol/L within 48 hours, tolvaptan treatment is to be 
interrupted or discontinued followed by administration of hypotonic fluid. 
In patients at higher risk of demyelination syndromes, for example those with hypoxia, alcoholism or 
malnutrition, the appropriate rate of sodium correction may be lower than that in patients without risk 
factors; these patients should be very carefully managed. 
Patients who received other treatment for hyponatremia or medicinal products which increase serum 
sodium concentration (see section 4.5) prior to initiation of treatment with tolvaptan must be managed 
very cautiously. These patients may be at higher risk for developing rapid correction of serum sodium 
during the first 1 to 2 days of treatment due to potential additive effects. 
Co-administration of tolvaptan with other treatments for hyponatremia, and medicinal products that 
increase serum sodium concentration, is not recommended during initial treatment or for other patients 
with very low baseline serum sodium concentrations (see section 4.5). 
Diabetes mellitus 
Diabetic patients with an elevated glucose concentration (e.g., in excess of 300 mg/dL) may present 
with pseudo-hyponatremia. This condition should be excluded prior and during treatment with 
tolvaptan. 
Tolvaptan may cause hyperglycemia (see section 4.8). Therefore, diabetic patients treated with 
tolvaptan should be managed cautiously. In particular this applies to patients with inadequately 
controlled type II diabetes. 
Idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity 
Liver injury induced by tolvaptan was observed in clinical trials investigating a different indication 
(autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [ADPKD]) with long-term use of tolvaptan at higher 
doses than for the approved indication (see section 4.8). 
In post-marketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute liver failure requiring liver 
transplantation has been reported (see section 4.8). 
In these clinical trials, clinically significant increases (greater than 3 × Upper Limit of Normal [ULN]) 
in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), along with clinically significant increases (greater than 
2 × ULN) in serum total bilirubin were observed in 3 patients treated with tolvaptan. In addition, an 
increased incidence of significant elevations of ALT was observed in patients treated with tolvaptan 
[4.4 % (42/958)] compared to those receiving placebo [1.0 % (5/484)]. Elevation (> 3 × ULN) of 
serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was observed in 3.1 % (30/958) of patients on tolvaptan and 
0.8 % (4/484) patients on placebo. Most of the liver enzyme abnormalities were observed during the 
first 18 months of treatment. The elevations gradually improved after discontinuation of tolvaptan. 
These findings may suggest that tolvaptan has the potential to cause irreversible and potentially fatal 
liver injury. 
In a post-authorisation safety study of tolvaptan in hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, several cases 
of hepatic disorders and elevated transaminases were observed (see section 4.8). 
Liver function tests must be promptly performed in patients taking tolvaptan who report symptoms 
that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark 
urine or jaundice. If liver injury is suspected, tolvaptan must be promptly discontinued, appropriate 
treatment has to be instituted, and investigations have to be performed to determine the probable 
cause. Tolvaptan must not be re-initiated in patients unless the cause for the observed liver injury is 
definitively established to be unrelated to treatment with tolvaptan. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anaphylaxis 
In post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock and generalised rash) has 
been reported very rarely following administration of tolvaptan. Patients have to be carefully 
monitored during treatment. Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to benzazepine or 
benzazepine derivatives (e.g., benazepril, conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) may be at 
risk for hypersensitivity reaction to tolvaptan (see section 4.3). 
If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reactions occur, administration of tolvaptan must 
be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Since hypersensitivity is a 
contraindication (see section 4.3) treatment must never be restarted after an anaphylactic reaction or 
other serious allergic reactions. 
Lactose 
Tolvaptan contains lactose as an excipient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Co-administration with other treatments for hyponatremia and medicinal products that increase serum 
sodium concentration 
There is no experience from controlled clinical trials with concomitant use of tolvaptan and other 
treatments for hyponatremia such as hypertonic sodium chloride solution, oral sodium formulations, 
and medicinal products that increase serum sodium concentration. Medicinal products with high 
sodium content such as effervescent analgesic preparations and certain sodium containing treatments 
for dyspepsia may also increase serum sodium concentration. Concomitant use of tolvaptan with other 
treatments for hyponatremia or other medicinal products that increase serum sodium concentration 
may result in a higher risk for developing rapid correction of serum sodium (see section 4.4) and is 
therefore not recommended during initial treatment or for other patients with very low baseline serum 
sodium concentrations where rapid correction may represent a risk for osmotic demyelination (see 
section 4.4). 
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan  
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Tolvaptan plasma concentrations have been increased by up to 5.4-fold area under time-concentration 
curve (AUC) after the administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Caution should be exercised in 
co-administering CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics, diltiazem) with 
tolvaptan (see section 4.4). Co-administration of grapefruit juice and tolvaptan resulted in a 1.8-fold 
increase in exposure to tolvaptan. Patients taking tolvaptan should avoid ingesting grapefruit juice. 
CYP3A4 inducers 
Tolvaptan plasma concentrations have been decreased by up to 87 % (AUC) after the administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. Caution has to be exercised in co-administering CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, 
barbiturates) with tolvaptan. 
Effect of tolvaptan on the pharmacokinetics of other products  
CYP3A4 substrates 
In healthy subjects, tolvaptan, a CYP3A4 substrate, had no effect on the plasma concentrations of 
some other CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., warfarin or amiodarone). Tolvaptan increased plasma levels of 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lovastatin by 1.3-fold to 1.5-fold. Even though this increase has no clinical relevance, it indicates 
tolvaptan can potentially increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates. 
Transporter substrates  
P-glycoprotein substrates 
In-vitro studies indicate that tolvaptan is a substrate and competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). Steady state digoxin concentrations were increased (1.3-fold in maximum observed plasma 
concentration [Cmax] and 1.2-fold in area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing 
interval [AUCτ]) when co-administered with multiple once daily 60 mg doses of tolvaptan. Patients 
receiving digoxin or other narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates (e.g., dabigatran etexilate) must 
therefore be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects when treated with tolvaptan. 
BCRP and OCT1 
Co-administration of tolvaptan (90 mg) with rosuvastatin (5 mg), a BCRP substrate, increased 
rosuvastatin Cmax and AUCt of 54 % and 69 %, respectively. If BCRP substrates (e.g., sulfasalazine) 
are co-administered with tolvaptan, patients must be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive 
effects of these medicinal products. 
If OCT1 substrates (e.g., metformin) are co-administered with tolvaptan, patients must be managed 
cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects of these medicinal products. 
Diuretics 
While there does not appear to be a synergistic or additive effect of concomitant use of tolvaptan with 
loop and thiazide diuretics, each class of agent has the potential to lead to severe dehydration, which 
constitutes a risk factor for renal dysfunction. If dehydration or renal dysfunction becomes evident, 
take appropriate action which may include the need to interrupt or reduce doses of tolvaptan and/or 
diuretics, increase fluid intake, evaluate and address other potential causes of renal dysfunction or 
dehydration. 
Co-administration with vasopressin analogues 
In addition to its renal aquaretic effect, tolvaptan is capable of blocking vascular vasopressin 
V2-receptors involved in the release of coagulation factors (e.g., von Willebrand factor) from 
endothelial cells. Therefore, the effect of vasopressin analogues such as desmopressin may be 
attenuated in patients using such analogues to prevent or control bleeding when co-administered with 
tolvaptan. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of tolvaptan in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Tolvaptan is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential 
have to use effective contraception during tolvaptan treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tolvaptan is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological 
data in animals have shown excretion of tolvaptan in breast milk (for details see 5.3). The potential 
risk for humans is unknown. Tolvaptan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Studies in animals showed effects on fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tolvaptan has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, when 
driving or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness, asthenia or 
syncope may occur. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The adverse reaction profile of tolvaptan in SIADH is based on a clinical trials database of 
3 294 tolvaptan-treated patients and is consistent with the pharmacology of the active substance. The 
pharmaco-dynamically predictable and most commonly reported adverse reactions are thirst, dry 
mouth and pollakiuria occurring in approximately 18 %, 9 % and 6 % of patients. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequencies of the adverse reactions from clinical trials correspond with very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very 
rare (< 1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The frequency of adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use cannot be determined as they 
are derived from spontaneous reports. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse reactions is 
qualified as "not known".

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rapid correction of hyponatremia 
In a post-authorisation safety study of tolvaptan in hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, including a 
high proportion of patients with tumours (especially small cell lung cancer), patients with low baseline 
serum sodium as well as patients with concomitant use of diuretics and/or sodium chloride solution the 
incidence of rapid correction of hyponatremia was found to be higher than in clinical trials. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses up to 480 mg and multiple doses up to 300 mg per day for 5 days have been well 
tolerated in clinical trials in healthy volunteers. There is no specific antidote for tolvaptan intoxication. 
The signs and symptoms of an acute overdose can be anticipated to be those of excessive 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacologic effect: a rise in serum sodium concentration, polyuria, thirst and 
dehydration/hypovolemia (profuse and prolonged aquaresis). 
In patients with suspected tolvaptan overdose, assessment of vital signs, electrolyte concentrations, 
ECG and fluid status is recommended. Appropriate replacement of water and/or electrolytes must 
continue until aquaresis abates. Dialysis may not be effective in removing tolvaptan because of its 
high binding affinity for human plasma protein (> 98 %). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diuretics, vasopressin antagonists, ATC code: C03XA01 
Mechanism of action 
Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist that specifically blocks the binding of 
arginine vasopressin (AVP) at the V2-receptor of the distal portions of the nephron. Tolvaptan affinity 
for the human V2-receptor is 1.8-times that of native AVP. 
In healthy adult subjects, oral administration of 7.5 mg to 120 mg doses of tolvaptan produced an 
increase in urine excretion rate within 2 hours of dosing. Following single oral doses of 7.5 mg to 
60 mg, 24-hour urine volume increased dose dependently with daily volumes ranging from 3 to 
9 litres. For all doses, urine excretion rates returned to baseline levels after 24 hours. For single doses 
60 mg to 480 mg, a mean of about 7 litres was excreted during 0 to 12 hours, independent of dose. 
Markedly higher doses of tolvaptan produce more sustained responses without affecting the magnitude 
of excretion, as active concentrations of tolvaptan are present for longer periods of time. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Hyponatremia 
In 2 pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials, a total of 424 patients with euvolemic or 
hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mEq/L) due to a variety of underlying causes (heart 
failure [HF], liver cirrhosis, SIADH and others) were treated for 30 days with tolvaptan (n = 216) or 
placebo (n = 208) at an initial dose of 15 mg/day. The dose could be increased to 30 mg/day and 
60 mg/day depending on response using a 3-day titration scheme. The mean serum sodium 
concentration at trial entry was 129 mEq/L (range 114 mEq/L to 136 mEq/L). 
The primary endpoint for these trials was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from 
baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30. Tolvaptan was superior to placebo (p < 0.0001) for both 
periods in both studies. This effect was seen in all patients, the severe (serum sodium: < 130 mEq/L) 
and mild (serum sodium: 130 mEq/L to < 135 mEq/L) subsets and for all disease aetiology subsets 
(e.g., HF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other). At 7 days after discontinuing treatment, sodium values decreased 
to levels of placebo treated patients. 
Following 3 days of treatment, the pooled analysis of the two trials revealed 5-fold more tolvaptan 
than placebo patients achieved normalisation of serum sodium concentrations (49 % vs. 11 %). This 
effect continued as on Day 30, when more tolvaptan than placebo patients still had normal 
concentrations (60 % vs. 27 %). These responses were seen in patients independent of the underlying 
disease. The results of self-assessed health status using the SF-12 Health Survey for the mental scores 
showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements for tolvaptan treatment compared 
to placebo. 
Data on the long-term safety and efficacy of tolvaptan were assessed for up to 106 weeks in a clinical 
trial in patients (any aetiology) who had previously completed one of the pivotal hyponatremia trials. 
A total of 111 patients started tolvaptan treatment in an open-label, extension trial, regardless of their 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous randomisation. Improvements in serum sodium levels were observed as early as the first day 
after dosing and continued for on-treatment assessments up to Week 106. When treatment was 
discontinued, serum sodium concentrations decreased to approximately baseline values, despite the 
reinstatement of standard care therapy. 
In a pilot, randomised (1:1:1), double-blind trial in 30 patients with hyponatremia secondary to 
SIADH, the pharmacodynamics of tolvaptan following single doses of 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg and 15 mg 
were assessed. Results were highly variable with large overlap between dose groups; changes were not 
significantly correlated with tolvaptan exposure. Mean maximal changes in serum sodium were 
highest following the 15 mg dose (7.9 mmol/L) but median maximal changes were highest for the 
7.5 mg dose (6.0 mmol/L). Individual maximal increases in serum sodium were negatively correlated 
with fluid balance; mean change in fluid balance showed a dose dependent decrease. Mean change 
from baseline in cumulative urine volume and urine excretion rates was 2-fold higher for the 15 mg 
dose compared to the 7.5 mg and 3.75 mg doses, which showed similar responses. 
Heart failure 
EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan) 
was a long-term outcome, double-blind, controlled clinical trial in patients hospitalised with worsening 
HF and signs and symptoms of volume overload. In the long-term outcome trial, a total of 
2 072 patients received 30 mg tolvaptan with standard of care (SC) and 2 061 received placebo with 
SC. The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of tolvaptan + SC with placebo + 
SC on the time to all-cause mortality and on the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) 
mortality or hospitalisation for HF. Tolvaptan treatment had no statistically significant favourable or 
unfavourable effects on overall survival or the combined endpoint of CV mortality or HF 
hospitalisation, and did not provide convincing evidence for clinically relevant benefit. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
tolvaptan in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of dilutional hyponatremia 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, tolvaptan is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring 
about 2 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of tolvaptan is about 56 %. Co-administration 
of a 60 mg dose with a high-fat meal increases peak concentrations 1.4-fold with no change in AUC 
and no change in urine output. Following single oral doses of 300 mg, peak plasma concentrations 
appear to plateau, possibly due to saturation of absorption. 
Distribution 
Tolvaptan binds reversibly (98 %) to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation  
Tolvaptan is extensively metabolised by the liver. Less than 1 % of intact active substance is excreted 
unchanged in the urine. 
In-vitro studies indicate that tolvaptan or its oxobutyric metabolite may have the potential to inhibit 
OATP1B1, OAT3, BCRP and OCT1 transporters. Administration of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) 
or furosemide (OAT3 substrate) to healthy subjects with elevated oxobutyric acid metabolite (inhibitor 
of OATP1B1 and OAT3) plasma concentrations did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of 
rosuvastatin or furosemide. See also section 4.5.

Elimination 
The terminal elimination half-life is about 8 hours and steady-state concentrations of tolvaptan are 
obtained after the first dose. 
Radio-labelled tolvaptan experiments showed that 40 % of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine 
and 59 % was recovered in the faeces where unchanged tolvaptan accounted for 32 % of radioactivity. 
Tolvaptan is only a minor component in plasma (3 %). 
Linearity 
Tolvaptan has linear pharmacokinetics for doses of 7.5 mg to 60 mg. 
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups 
Age 
Clearance of tolvaptan is not significantly affected by age. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh classes A and B) on the 
pharmacokinetics of tolvaptan was investigated in 87 patients with liver disease of various origins. No 
clinically significant changes have been seen in clearance for doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg. Very 
limited information is available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hepatic oedema, AUC of tolvaptan in severely 
(Child-Pugh class C) and mildly or moderately (Child-Pugh classes A and B) hepatic impaired patients 
were 3.1-times and 2.3-times higher than that in healthy subjects. 
Renal impairment 
In an analysis on population pharmacokinetics for patients with heart failure, tolvaptan concentrations 
of patients with mildly (creatinine clearance [Ccr] 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min) or moderately 
(Ccr 20 mL/min to 50 mL/min) impaired renal function were not significantly different to tolvaptan 
concentrations in patients with normal renal function (Ccr 80 mL/min to 150 mL/min). The efficacy and 
safety of tolvaptan in those with a creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min has not been evaluated and is 
therefore unknown. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential. 
Teratogenicity was noted in rabbits given 1 000 mg/kg/day (3.9-times the exposure in humans at the 
60 mg dose, based on AUC). No teratogenic effects were seen in rabbits at 300 mg/kg/day (up to 
1.9-times the exposure in humans at the 60 mg dose, based on AUC). 
In a peri-and post-natal study in rats, delayed ossification and reduced pup bodyweight were seen at 
the high dose of 1 000 mg/kg/day. 
Two fertility studies in rats showed effects on the parental generation (decreased food consumption 
and body weight gain, salivation), but tolvaptan did not affect reproductive performance in males and 
there were no effects on the foetuses. In females, abnormal oestrus cycles were seen in both studies. 
The no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) for effects on reproduction in females 
(100 mg/kg/day) was about 6.7-times the exposure in humans at the 60 mg dose, based on AUC.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tolvaptan Accord is and what it is used for 
Tolvaptan Accord, which contains the active substance tolvaptan, belongs to a group of medicines 
called vasopressin antagonists. Vasopressin is a hormone that helps prevent the loss of water from the 
body by reducing urine output. Antagonist means that it prevents vasopressin having its effect on 
water retention. This leads to a reduction in the amount of water in the body by increasing urine 
production and as a result it increases the level or concentration of sodium in your blood. 
Tolvaptan Accord is used to treat low serum sodium levels in adults. You have been prescribed this 
medicine because you have a lowered sodium level in your blood as a result of a disease called 
“syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion” (SIADH) where the kidneys retain too 
much water. This disease causes an inappropriate production of the hormone vasopressin which has 
caused the sodium levels in your blood to get too low (hyponatremia). That can lead to difficulties in 
concentration and memory, or in keeping your balance. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Tolvaptan Accord 
Do not take Tolvaptan Accord 
• 
if you are allergic to tolvaptan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) or if you are allergic to benzazepine or benzazepine derivatives (e.g., benazepril, 
conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine) 
if your kidneys do not work (no urine production) 
if you have a condition which increases the salt in your blood (“hypernatremia”) 
if you have a condition which is associated with a very low blood volume 
if you do not realise when you are thirsty 
if you are pregnant 
if you are breast-feeding.

Warnings and precautions 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tolvaptan Accord: 
if you cannot drink enough water or if you are fluid restricted 
• 
if you have difficulties in urination or have an enlarged prostate 
• 
if you suffer from liver disease 
• 
if you had an allergic reaction in the past to benzazepine, tolvaptan or other benzazepine 
• 
derivatives (e.g., benazepril, conivaptan, fenoldopam mesylate or mirtazapine), or to any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you suffer from a kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD) 
if you have diabetes. 
• 
• 
Drinking enough water 
Tolvaptan Accord causes water loss because it increases your urine production. This water loss may 
result in side effects such as dry mouth and thirst or even more severe side effects like kidney 
problems (see Section 4). It is therefore important that you have access to water and that you are able 
to drink sufficient amounts when you feel thirsty. 
Children and adolescents 
Tolvaptan Accord is not suitable for children and adolescents (under age 18). 
Other medicines and Tolvaptan Accord 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes all medicines obtained without a prescription. 
The following medicines may increase the effect of this medicine: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ketoconazole (against fungal infections), 
macrolide antibiotics, 
diltiazem (treatment for high blood pressure and chest pain), 
other products which increase the salt in your blood or which contain large amounts of salt. 
The following medicines may lower the effect of this medicine: 
• 
• 
barbiturates (used to treat epilepsy/seizures and some sleep disorders), 
rifampicin (against tuberculosis). 
This medicine may increase the effect of the following medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
digoxin (used for treatment of irregularities of heartbeat and heart failure), 
dabigatran etexilate (used to thin the blood),  
metformin (used to treat diabetes),  
sulfasalazine (used to treat inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis). 
This medicine may lower the effect of the following medicines: 
• 
desmopressin (used to increase blood clotting factors). 
It may still be alright for you to take these medicines and Tolvaptan Accord together. Your doctor will 
be able to decide what is suitable for you. 
Tolvaptan Accord with food and drink 
Avoid drinking grapefruit juice when taking Tolvaptan Accord.

Driving and using machines 
Tolvaptan Accord is unlikely to adversely affect your ability to drive or to operate machinery. 
However, you may occasionally feel dizzy or weak or you may faint for a short period. 
Tolvaptan Accord contains lactose  
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
3. 
How to take Tolvaptan Accord 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment with Tolvaptan Accord will be initiated in hospital. 
For treatment of your low sodium (hyponatremia), your doctor will start with a dose of 15 mg 
and may then increase it to a maximum of 60 mg to achieve the desired level of serum sodium. 
To monitor the effects of Tolvaptan Accord your doctor will do regular blood tests. To achieve 
the desired level of serum sodium your doctor can give in some instances a lower dose of 
7.5 mg. 
Swallow the tablet without chewing, with a glass of water. 
Take the tablets once a day preferably in the morning with or without food. 
If you take more Tolvaptan Accord than you should 
If you have taken more tablets than your prescribed dose, drink plenty of water and contact your 
doctor or your local hospital immediately. Remember to take the medicine pack with you so that it 
is clear what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Tolvaptan Accord 
If you forget to take your medicine, you have to take the dose as soon as you remember on the same 
day. If you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Tolvaptan Accord 
If you stop taking Tolvaptan Accord this may lead to reoccurrence of your low sodium. Therefore, you 
should only stop taking Tolvaptan Accord if you notice side effects requiring urgent medical attention 
(see section 4) or if your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

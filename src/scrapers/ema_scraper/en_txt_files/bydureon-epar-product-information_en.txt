CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Bydureon is indicated in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products 
including basal insulin, when the therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control.
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is 2 mg exenatide once weekly. 
Patients switching from immediate-release (Byetta) to prolonged-release (Bydureon or Bydureon 
BCise) exenatide, may experience transient elevations in blood glucose concentrations, which 
generally improve within the first two weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients switching between the 
prolonged-release exenatide products (Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may do so, with no expected 
relevant effect on blood glucose concentrations.
When prolonged-release exenatide is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, 
the current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued. When added to 
sulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Combination therapy with thiazolidinedione was only studied 
in adult patients.
Prolonged-release exenatide should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day 
of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered at least 
three days before. Prolonged-release exenatide can be administered at any time of day, with or without 
meals. 
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as practical, provided the next regularly 
scheduled dose is due in 3 days or more. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual once weekly 
dosing schedule. 
2
If a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not 
administer the missed dose, but instead resume prolonged-release exenatide on the next regularly 
scheduled dosing day.
The use of prolonged-release exenatide does not require additional self-monitoring. Blood glucose 
self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and of insulin, particularly when 
prolonged-release exenatide therapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin 
dose reduction is recommended. 
If a different glucose-lowering treatment is started after the discontinuation of prolonged-release 
exenatide, consideration should be given to the prolonged release of the medicinal product (see section 
5.2).
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required based on age. However, as renal function generally declines with age, 
consideration should be given to the patient’s renal function (see Renal impairment) (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Prolonged-release exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or 
severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min) (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
No dose adjustment is required for adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. No data are 
available for children below 10 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Subcutaneous use
Prolonged-release exenatide is for self-administration by the patient. Each kit should be used by one 
person only and is for single use. 
Prior to initiation of prolonged-release exenatide, it is strongly recommended that patients and 
caregivers be trained by their healthcare professional. The “Instructions for the User”, provided in the 
carton, must be followed carefully.
Each dose should be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the back of the upper arm as a 
subcutaneous injection immediately after suspension of the powder in the solvent. 
When used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate 
injections.
For instructions on the suspension of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
the “Instructions for the User”.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
3
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Prolonged-release exenatide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the 
treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Prolonged-release exenatide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in 
insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). 
Prolonged-release exenatide must not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection.
Renal impairment
In patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of immediate-release exenatide 
increased frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions; therefore, prolonged-release 
exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe renal 
impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min).
There have been uncommon events of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum 
creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes 
requiring haemodialysis. Some of these events occurred in patients experiencing events that may affect 
hydration, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and/or receiving medicinal products known to 
affect renal function/hydration status. Concomitant medicinal products included angiotensin 
converting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal 
products and diuretics. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed with supportive 
treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative medicinal products, including exenatide.
Severe gastrointestinal disease
Prolonged-release exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, 
including gastroparesis. Its use is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, 
including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Therefore, the use of prolonged-release exenatide is not 
recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.
Acute pancreatitis
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In 
clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.3% of patients. There 
have been spontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis with prolonged-release exenatide. 
Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment, but very rare cases of 
necrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. Patients should be informed 
of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, prolonged-release exenatide should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, 
prolonged-release exenatide should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a 
history of pancreatitis.
Concomitant medicinal products
The concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide with D-phenylalanine derivatives (meglitinides), 
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor agonists has 
not been studied. The concurrent use of prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide has not
been studied and is not recommended.
Lack of efficacy due to anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in paediatric patients
Paediatric patients are possibly more prone to developing high titers of ADA than adults (see section 
4.8). Patients with higher titre antibodies may have an attenuated HbA1c response.
No commercial testing of anti-drug antibodies is available, but if targeted glycaemic control is not 
achieved despite confirmed patient compliance, regardless of the reason for the lack of efficacy, 
physicians should consider alternative antidiabetic therapy.
4
Interaction with warfarin
There have been spontaneously reported cases of increased INR (International Normalised Ratio), 
sometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant use of warfarin and exenatide (see section 4.5).
Hypoglycaemia
The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in combination 
with a sulphonylurea in clinical studies. Furthermore, in the clinical studies, patients on a 
sulphonylurea combination, with mild renal impairment had an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia 
compared to patients with normal renal function. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with 
the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.
Rapid weight loss
Rapid weight loss at a rate of  > 1.5 kg per week has been reported in patients treated with exenatide. 
Weight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences. Patients with rapid weight loss should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of cholelithiasis.
Discontinuation of treatment
After discontinuation, the effect of prolonged-release exenatide may continue as plasma levels of 
exenatide decline over 10 weeks. Choice of other medicinal products and dose selection should be 
considered accordingly, as adverse reactions may continue and efficacy may, at least partly, persist 
until exenatide levels decline.
Excipients
Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. 
essentially “sodium-free”.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Sulphonylureas
The dose of a sulphonylurea may require adjustment due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia 
associated with sulphonylurea therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Gastric emptying
The results of a study using paracetamol as a marker of gastric emptying suggest that the effect of 
prolonged-release exenatide to slow gastric emptying is minor and not expected to cause clinically 
significant reductions in the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral 
medicinal products. Therefore, no dose adjustments for medicinal products sensitive to delayed gastric 
emptying are required.
When 1,000 mg paracetamol tablets were administered, either with or without a meal, following 
14 weeks of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, no significant changes in paracetamol AUC were 
observed compared to the control period. Paracetamol Cmax decreased by 16% (fasting) and 5% (fed) 
and tmax was increased from approximately 1 hour in the control period to 1.4 hours (fasting) and 
1.3 hours (fed). 
The following interaction studies have been conducted using 10 mcg immediate-release exenatide but 
not prolonged-release exenatide:
Warfarin
A delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed when warfarin was administered 35 min after 
immediate-release exenatide. No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC were observed. Increased 
INR has been spontaneously reported during concomitant use of warfarin and prolonged-release 
exenatide. INR should be monitored during initiation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy in 
patients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
5
Hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors
Lovastatin AUC and Cmax were decreased approximately 40% and 28%, respectively, and tmax was 
delayed about 4 h when immediate-release exenatide was administered concomitantly with a single 
dose of lovastatin (40 mg) compared with lovastatin administered alone. In 30-week 
placebo-controlled clinical studies with immediate-release exenatide, concomitant use of exenatide 
and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles (see 
section 5.1). No predetermined dose adjustment is required; however, lipid profiles should be 
monitored as appropriate.
Digoxin and lisinopril
In interaction studies of the effect of immediate-release exenatide on digoxin and lisinopril there were 
no clinical relevant effects on Cmax or AUC, however, a delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed. 
Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel
Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg 
levonorgestrel) one hour before immediate-release exenatide did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of 
either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 35 minutes after 
exenatide did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and 
Cmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The 
reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is 
required.
Paediatric population
Interaction studies with exenatide have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Due to the long washout period of prolonged-release exenatide, women of childbearing potential 
should use contraception during treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. This medicinal product 
should be discontinued at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of prolonged-release exenatide in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Prolonged-release exenatide should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is 
recommended. 
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether exenatide is excreted in human milk. Prolonged-release exenatide should not be 
used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
No fertility studies in humans have been conducted.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Prolonged-release exenatide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When
prolonged-release exenatide is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, patients should be advised to 
take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions in adults were mainly gastrointestinal related (nausea which was 
the most frequent reaction and associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over time, and 
diarrhoea). In addition, injection site reactions (pruritus, nodules, erythema), hypoglycaemia (with a 
6
sulphonylurea), and headache occurred. Most adverse reactions associated with prolonged-release 
exenatide were mild to moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The frequency of adverse reactions of prolonged-release exenatide identified from clinical studies and 
spontaneous reports in adults (not observed in clinical studies, frequency not known) are summarised 
in Table 1 below.
In the prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies in adults, background therapies included diet and 
exercise, metformin, a sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of oral glucose-lowering 
medicinal products or a basal insulin. 
The reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to  1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) very rare (< 1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia 
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP) with exenatide-dependent anti-platelet antibodies has been 
reported in adults in the postmarketing setting. DITP is an immune-mediated reaction that is caused by 
drug-dependent platelet-reactive antibodies. These antibodies cause destruction of platelets in the 
presence of the sensitizing drug.
Hypoglycaemia
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in adults 
in combination with a sulphonylurea (24.0% versus 5.4%) (see section 4.4). To reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may 
be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Prolonged-release exenatide was associated with a significantly lower incidence of episodes of 
hypoglycaemia than basal insulin in patients also receiving metformin therapy (3% versus 19%) and in 
patients also receiving metformin plus sulphonylurea therapy (20% versus 42%).
Across 12 studies of prolonged-release exenatide most episodes (99.9% n = 649) of hypoglycaemia 
were minor, and resolved with oral administration of carbohydrate. One patient was reported with 
major hypoglycaemia since he had a low blood glucose value (2.2 mmol/L) and requested assistance 
with oral carbohydrate treatment which resolved the event.
When prolonged-release exenatide was added to basal insulin, no initial dose adjustment of insulin 
was required. Prolonged-release exenatide in combination with basal insulin showed no clinically 
significant differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin. There were no 
episodes of major hypoglycaemia in the prolonged-release exenatide with insulin group.
Nausea
The most frequently reported adverse reaction in adults was nausea. In patients treated with 
prolonged-release exenatide, generally 20% reported at least one episode of nausea compared to 34% 
of immediate-release exenatide patients. Most episodes of nausea were mild to moderate. With 
continued therapy, the frequency decreased in most patients who initially experienced nausea. 
The incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events during the 30-week controlled study was 6% for 
prolonged-release exenatide treated patients, 5% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients. The 
most common adverse events leading to withdrawal in either treatment group were nausea and 
vomiting. Withdrawal due to nausea or vomiting each occurred in < 1% for prolonged-release 
exenatide treated patients and 1% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients. 
Injection site reactions
Injection site reactions in adults were observed more frequently in prolonged-release exenatide treated 
patients versus comparator-treated patients (16% versus range of 2-7%) during the 6-month controlled 
phase of studies. These injection site reactions were generally mild and usually did not lead to 
withdrawal from studies. Patients may be treated to relieve symptoms, while continuing treatment. 
Subsequent injections should use a different site of injection each week. In postmarketing experiences, 
cases with injection site abscesses and cellulitis have been reported. 
Small subcutaneous injection site nodules were observed very frequently in clinical studies, consistent 
with the known properties of poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) polymer microsphere formulations. Most 
individual nodules were asymptomatic, did not interfere with study participation and resolved over 4 
to 8 weeks.
9
Immunogenicity
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, 
patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. In 
most patients who develop antibodies, antibody titres diminish over time. 
The presence of antibodies (high or low titres) is not predictive of glycaemic control for an individual 
patient.
In clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide in adults, approximately 45% of patients had low 
titre antibodies to exenatide at study endpoint. Overall, the percentage of antibody positive patients 
was consistent across clinical studies. Overall, the level of glycaemic control (HbA1c) was comparable 
to that observed in those without antibody titres. On average in the phase 3 studies, 12% of the patients 
had higher titre antibodies. In a proportion of these the glycaemic response to prolonged-release 
exenatide was absent at the end of the controlled period of studies; 2.6% of patients showed no 
glucose improvement with higher titre antibodies whereas 1.6% showed no improvement while 
antibody negative.
Patients who developed antibodies to exenatide tend to have more injection site reactions (for 
example: redness of skin and itching), but otherwise similar rates and types of adverse events as those 
with no antibodies to exenatide.
For prolonged-release exenatide treated adult patients, the incidence of potentially immunogenic 
injection site reactions (most commonly pruritus with or without erythema) during the 30-week and 
the two 26-week studies was 9%. These reactions were less commonly observed in antibody-negative 
patients (4%) compared with antibody-positive patients (13%), with a greater incidence in those with 
higher titre antibodies.
Examination of antibody-positive specimens revealed no significant cross-reactivity with similar 
endogenous peptides (glucagon or GLP-1).
Rapid weight loss
In a 30-week study in adults, approximately 3% (n = 4/148) of prolonged-release exenatide treated 
patients experienced at least one time period of rapid weight loss (recorded body weight loss between 
two consecutive study visits of greater than 1.5 kg/week). 
Increased heart rate
A mean increase in heart rate (HR) of 2.6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (74 bpm) was 
observed in pooled prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies in adults. Fifteen percent of 
prolonged-release exenatide treated patients had mean increases in HR of ≥ 10 bpm; approximately 
5% to 10% of subjects within the other treatment groups had mean increases in HR of ≥ 10 bpm.
Paediatric population
The exenatide safety profile in a clinical study with adolescents and children aged 10 years or older
(see section 5.1) was similar to that observed in the studies in adults.
In the paediatric study there were no major hypoglycaemia events. 
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, one patient (1.7%) in the prolonged-release 
exenatide group and one patient (4.3%) in the placebo group had minor hypoglycaemia (defined as a
non-major hypoglycaemia event that had symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and a glucose 
value less than 3 mmol/L [54 mg/dL] prior to treating the episode). Both patients were receiving 
insulin as background therapy.
Other hypoglycaemia events, episodes that did not meet either major or minor criteria, were reported 
by the investigator in 8 patients (13.6%) and 1 patient (4.3%) in the prolonged-release exenatide and 
placebo groups, respectively. Out of these, 6 patients in the prolonged-release exenatide group and
1 patient in the placebo group received insulin as background therapy.
10
In the paediatric study the maximum antibody titre obtained at any time during the study was low 
(<625) for approximately 30% of patients and high (≥625) for approximately 63% of patients. The 
percentage of patients with positive antibody titres peaked at approximately Week 12. As the study 
continued to Week 52 the percentage of patients with high titres had decreased (31%) and percentage 
of the patients with low titres (40%) had increased. Patients with higher titre antibodies may have an 
attenuated HbA1c response (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Effects of overdoses with exenatide (based on immediate-release exenatide clinical studies) included 
severe nausea, severe vomiting and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations. In the event of 
overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs 
and symptoms. 
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC 
code: A10BJ01.
Mechanism of action
Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that exhibits several 
antihyperglycaemic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The amino acid sequence of 
exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate 
the known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, its mechanism of action mediated by cyclic AMP and/or 
other intracellular signalling pathways. 
Exenatide increases, on a glucose-dependent basis, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. 
As blood glucose concentrations decrease, insulin secretion subsides. When exenatide was used in 
combination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, no increase in the incidence of 
hypoglycaemia was observed over that of placebo in combination with metformin and/or a 
thiazolidinedione which may be due to this glucose-dependent insulinotropic mechanism (see section 
4.4).
Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. 
However, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response and other hormone responses to 
hypoglycaemia. 
Exenatide slows gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in 
the circulation.
Administration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake, due to decreased appetite and 
increased satiety.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Exenatide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering both postprandial and 
fasting glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike native GLP-1, prolonged-
11
release exenatide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once 
weekly administration.
A pharmacodynamic study with exenatide demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) a 
restoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to 
an intravenous bolus of glucose.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The results of long-term clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide are presented below; these 
studies comprised 1356 adult subjects treated with prolonged-release exenatide, 52% men and 48% 
women; 230 subjects (17%) were ≥ 65 years of age.
In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (EXSCEL) enrolled 
14,752 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual 
care.
Glycaemic control
In two studies in adults prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly has been compared to 
immediate-release exenatide 5 mcg given twice daily for 4 weeks followed by immediate-release 
exenatide 10 mcg given twice daily. One study was of 24 weeks in duration (n = 252) and the other of 
30 weeks (n = 295) followed by an open labelled extension where all patients were treated with 
prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly, for a further 7 years (n = 258). In both studies, 
decreases in HbA1c were evident in both treatment groups as early as the first post-treatment HbA1c
measurement (Weeks 4 or 6).
Prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to 
patients receiving immediate-release exenatide (Table 2).
A clinically relevant effect of prolonged-release exenatide and immediate-release exenatide treated 
subjects was observed on HbA1c, regardless of the background anti-diabetic therapy in both studies.
Clinically and statistically significantly more subjects on prolonged-release compared to 
immediate-release exenatide patients achieved an HbA1c reduction of ≤ 7% or < 7% in the two studies 
(p < 0.05 and p ≤ 0.0001, respectively). 
Both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight 
compared to baseline, although the difference between the two treatment arms was not significant. 
In the uncontrolled study extension, evaluable patients who switched from immediate release to 
prolonged-release exenatide at Week 30 (n = 121), achieved the same improvement in HbA1c of -2.0% 
at Week 52 compared to baseline as patients treated with prolonged-release exenatide.
For all patients completing the uncontrolled study extension of 7 years (n = 122 of 258 patients 
included in the extension phase), HbA1c gradually increased over time from Week 52 onwards, but 
was still reduced compared to baseline after 7 years (-1.5%). Weight loss was sustained over 7 years in 
these patients.

A study of 26-week duration has been conducted in adults, in which prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg 
is compared to insulin glargine once daily. Compared with insulin glargine treatment, prolonged-
release exenatide demonstrated a superior change in HbA1c, significantly lowered mean body weight 
and was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events (Table 3).

1 Insulin glargine was dosed to a target glucose concentration of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/L (72 to 100 mg/dL).
The mean dose of insulin glargine at the beginning of treatment was 10.1 IU/day rising to 31.1 IU/day 
for insulin glargine-treated patients.
The 156-week results were consistent with those previously reported in the 26-week interim report. 
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide persistently significantly improved glycaemic control and 
weight control, compared to the insulin glargine treatment. Safety findings at 156 weeks were 
consistent with those reported at 26 weeks.
In a 26-week double-blind study prolonged-release exenatide was compared to maximum daily doses 
of sitagliptin and pioglitazone in adult subjects also using metformin. All treatment groups had a
significant reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. Prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated 
superiority to both sitagliptin and pioglitazone with respect to change in HbA1c from baseline. 
Prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly greater weight reductions compared to 
sitagliptin. Patients on pioglitazone gained weight (Table 4).

In a 28-week, double-blind study in adults, the combination of prolonged-release exenatide and 
dapagliflozin was compared to prolonged-release exenatide alone and dapagliflozin alone in subjects 
also using metformin. All treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. The 
prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin treatment group showed superior reductions in HbA1c 
from baseline compared to prolonged-release exenatide alone and dapagliflozin alone (Table 5). 
The combination of prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin demonstrated significantly greater 
weight reductions compared to either medicinal product alone (Table 5).

Cardiovascular evaluation
EXSCEL was a pragmatic cardiovascular (CV) outcome study in adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
and any level of CV risk. A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged-release 
exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 
inhibitors. Patients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a 
median treatment duration of 27.8 months. The vital status was known at the end of the study for 
98.9% and 98.8% of the patients in the prolonged-release exenatide and placebo group, respectively. 
The mean age at study entry was 62 years (with 8.5% of the patients ≥ 75 years). Approximately 62% 
17
of the patients were male. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 
13.1 years. The mean HbA1c was 8.1%. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to ≤ 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, 26.9% of patients did not have any prior 
CV event, 73.1% had at least one prior CV event.
The primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to 
first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV)-related death, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint 
assessed. 
Prolonged-release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; 
P < 0.001 for non-inferiority) see Figure 1. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis in EXSCEL, the HR 
for MACE was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77–0.97) in patients with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
1.01 (95% CI: 0.86–1.19) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The results of the 
primary composite and secondary cardiovascular endpoints are shown in Figure 2.

The need for additional antihyperglycaemic medication was reduced by 33% with the prolonged-
release exenatide group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 10.5 per 100 pt-year) compared to the placebo 
group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 15.7 per 100 pt-year). A reduction in HbA1c was observed over 
the course of the trial with an overall treatment difference of -0.53% (prolonged-release exenatide vs. 
placebo).
Body weight
A reduction in body weight compared to baseline has been observed in all prolonged-release exenatide 
studies. In the 4 comparator-controlled studies, this reduction in body weight was seen in patients 
treated with prolonged-release exenatide irrespective of the occurrence of nausea although the 
reduction was larger in the group with nausea (mean reduction of -2.9 kg to -5.2 kg with nausea 
versus -2.2 kg to -2.9 kg without nausea). 
In the 4 comparator-controlled studies, the proportion of patients who had both a reduction in weight 
and HbA1c ranged from 70 to 79% (the proportion of patients who had a reduction of HbA1c ranged 
from 88 to 96%). 
Plasma/serum glucose
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma/serum 
glucose concentrations, these reductions were observed as early as 4 weeks. In the placebo-controlled
study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in fasting plasma glucose 
was -0.7 mmol/L for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.1 mmol/L for the placebo group. 
Additional reductions in postprandial concentrations were also observed. The improvement in fasting 
plasma glucose concentrations was durable through 52 weeks.
Beta-cell function
Clinical studies with prolonged-release exenatide have indicated improved beta-cell function, using 
measures such as the homeostasis model assessments (HOMA-B). The durability of effect on beta-cell 
function was maintained through 52 weeks.
Blood pressure
A reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the 4 comparator-controlled prolonged-release 
exenatide studies (2.9 mmHg to 4.7 mmHg). In the 30-week immediate-release exenatide comparator 
study both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide significantly reduced systolic blood 
19
pressure from base line (4.7±1.1 mmHg and 3.4±1.1 mmHg, respectively); the difference between the 
treatments was not significant. Improvements in blood pressure were maintained through 52 weeks.
In the placebo-controlled study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in systolic 
blood pressure was -2.6 mmHg for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.7 mmHg for the 
placebo group.
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin combination at Week 28 resulted in a 
significant mean change reduction of -4.3±0.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to 
prolonged-release exenatide alone of -1.2±0.8 mmHg (p < 0.01) or to dapagliflozin alone of -1.8±0.8
mmHg (p < 0.05).
Fasting lipids
Prolonged-release exenatide has shown no negative effects on lipid parameters. 
Paediatric population
The efficacy and safety of prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo was evaluated in
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adolescents and children aged 
10 years and above with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a 
stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. The prolonged-release exenatide was superior to 
placebo in reducing HbA1c after 24 weeks (Table 7).

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The absorption properties of exenatide reflect the extended release properties of the prolonged-release 
exenatide formulation. Once absorbed into the circulation, exenatide is distributed and eliminated 
according to its known systemic pharmacokinetic properties (as described in this section).
Absorption
Following weekly administration of 2 mg prolonged-release exenatide, mean exenatide concentrations 
exceeded minimal efficacious concentrations (~ 50 pg/mL) in 2 weeks with gradual increase in the 
average plasma exenatide concentration over 6 to 7 weeks. Subsequently, exenatide concentrations of 
approximately 151-265 pg/mL were maintained indicating that steady state was achieved. Steady-state 
exenatide concentrations are maintained during the one-week interval between doses with minimal 
peak to trough fluctuation from this average therapeutic concentration.
Distribution
The mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following subcutaneous administration of a 
single dose of exenatide is 28 L.
Biotransformation and elimination
Nonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration 
with subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide is 9 L/h. These 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks 
after discontinuation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, mean plasma exenatide concentrations 
fell below minimal detectable concentrations.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of renal impaired patients receiving 2 mg prolonged-release 
exenatide indicate that there may be an increase in systemic exposure of approximately 74% and 23% 
(median prediction in each group) in moderate (N = 10) and mild (N = 56) renal impaired patients, 
respectively as compared to normal (N = 84) renal function patients. 
Hepatic insufficiency
No pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Exenatide is 
cleared primarily by the kidney; therefore hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood 
concentrations of exenatide.
Gender, race and body weight
Gender, race and body weight have no clinically relevant influence on exenatide pharmacokinetics. 
Elderly
Data in elderly are limited, but suggest no marked changes in exenatide exposure with increased age 
up to about 75 years old.
In a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
administration of exenatide (10 mcg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 
elderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to 
reduced renal function in the older age group (see section 4.2).
21
Paediatric population
The population pharmacokinetic analysis in adolescents and children with low ADA titre aged 
10 years and above with type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated that administration of prolonged-
release exenatide (2 mg) resulted in exposure similar to that observed in adults.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity conducted with immediate-release exenatide or 
prolonged-release exenatide. 
Thyroid tumours have been observed in rats and mice with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a 
2-year rat carcinogenicity study with prolonged-release exenatide, an increased incidence of C-cell 
adenomas and C-cell carcinomas was observed at doses ≥ 2-fold the human systemic exposure based 
on AUC. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown.
Animal studies with exenatide did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility; high doses of 
exenatide caused skeletal effects and reduced foetal and neonatal growth.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Bydureon is indicated in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products 
including basal insulin, when the therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control.
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is 2 mg exenatide once weekly. 
Patients switching from immediate-release (Byetta) to prolonged-release (Bydureon or Bydureon
BCise) exenatide may experience transient elevations in blood glucose concentrations, which 
generally improve within the first two weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients switching between the 
prolonged-release exenatide products (Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may do so, with no expected 
relevant effect on blood glucose concentrations.
When prolonged-release exenatide is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, 
the current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued. When added to 
sulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Combination therapy with thiazolidinedione was only studied 
in adult patients.
Prolonged-release exenatide should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day 
of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered at least 
three days before. Prolonged-release exenatide can be administered at any time of day, with or without 
meals.
24
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as practical, provided the next regularly 
scheduled dose is due in 3 days or more. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual once weekly 
dosing schedule. 
If a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not 
administer the missed dose, but instead resume prolonged-release exenatide on the next regularly 
scheduled dosing day.
The use of prolonged-release exenatide does not require additional self-monitoring. Blood glucose 
self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and of insulin, particularly when 
prolonged-release exenatide therapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin 
dose reduction is recommended.
If a different glucose-lowering treatment is started after the discontinuation of prolonged-release 
exenatide, consideration should be given to the prolonged release of the product (see section 5.2).
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required based on age. However, as renal function generally declines with age, 
consideration should be given to the patient’s renal function (see Renal impairment) (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Prolonged-release exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or 
severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30mL/min) (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
No dose adjustment is required for adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. No data are 
available for children below 10 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Subcutaneous use
Prolonged-release exenatide is for self-administration by the patient. Each pen can only be used by one 
person and is for single use. 
Prior to initiation of prolonged-release exenatide, it is strongly recommended that patients and 
caregivers be trained by their healthcare professional. The “Instructions for the User”, provided in the 
carton, must be followed carefully.
Each dose should be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the back of the upper arm as a 
subcutaneous injection immediately after suspension of the powder in the solvent. 
When used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate 
injections.
For instructions on the suspension of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
the “Instructions for the User”. 
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
25
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Prolonged-release exenatide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the 
treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Prolonged-release exenatide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in 
insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). 
Prolonged-release exenatide must not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection.
Renal impairment
In patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of immediate-release exenatide 
increased frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions; therefore, prolonged-release 
exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe renal 
impairment (GFR < 30mL/min). 
There have been uncommon events of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum 
creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes 
requiring haemodialysis. Some of these events occurred in patients experiencing events that may affect 
hydration, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and/or receiving medicinal products known to 
affect renal function/hydration status. Concomitant medicinal products included angiotensin 
converting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal 
products and diuretics. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed with supportive 
treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative medicinal products, including exenatide.
Severe gastrointestinal disease
Prolonged-release exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, 
including gastroparesis. Its use is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, 
including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Therefore, the use of prolonged-release exenatide is not 
recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.
Acute pancreatitis
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In 
clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.3% of patients. There 
have been spontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis with prolonged-release exenatide. 
Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment, but very rare cases of 
necrotising or haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. Patients should be informed 
of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, prolonged-release exenatide should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, 
prolonged-release exenatide should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a 
history of pancreatitis. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
The concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide with D-phenylalanine derivatives (meglitinides), 
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor agonists has 
not been studied. The concurrent use of prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide has not
been studied and is not recommended.
Lack of efficacy due to anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in paediatric patients
Paediatric patients are possibly more prone to developing high titers of ADA than adults (see section 
4.8). Patients with higher titre antibodies may have an attenuated HbA1c response.
No commercial testing of anti-drug antibodies is available, but if targeted glycaemic control is not 
achieved despite confirmed patient compliance, regardless of the reason for the lack of efficacy, 
physicians should consider alternative antidiabetic therapy.
26
Interaction with warfarin
There have been spontaneously reported cases of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio), 
sometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant use of warfarin and exenatide (see section 4.5).
Hypoglycaemia
The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in combination 
with a sulphonylurea in clinical studies. Furthermore, in the clinical studies, patients on a 
sulphonylurea combination, with mild renal impairment had an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia 
compared to patients with normal renal function. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with 
the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.
Rapid weight loss
Rapid weight loss at a rate of > 1.5 kg per week has been reported in patients treated with exenatide. 
Weight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences. Patients with rapid weight loss should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of cholelithiasis.
Discontinuation of treatment
After discontinuation, the effect of prolonged-release exenatide may continue as plasma levels of 
exenatide decline over 10 weeks. Choice of other medicinal products and dose selection should be 
considered accordingly, as adverse reactions may continue and efficacy may, at least partly, persist 
until exenatide levels decline.
Excipients
Sodium content: This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. 
essentially “sodium-free”.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Sulphonylureas
The dose of a sulphonylurea may require adjustment due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia 
associated with sulphonylurea therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Gastric emptying
The results of a study using paracetamol as a marker of gastric emptying suggest that the effect of 
prolonged-release exenatide to slow gastric emptying is minor and not expected to cause clinically 
significant reductions in the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral 
medicinal products. Therefore, no dose adjustments for medicinal products sensitive to delayed gastric 
emptying are required.
When 1,000 mg paracetamol tablets were administered, either with or without a meal, following 
14 weeks of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, no significant changes in paracetamol AUC were 
observed compared to the control period. Paracetamol Cmax decreased by 16% (fasting) and 5% (fed) 
and tmax was increased from approximately 1 hour in the control period to 1.4 hours (fasting) and 
1.3 hours (fed). 
The following interaction studies have been conducted using 10 mcg immediate-release exenatide but 
not prolonged-release exenatide:
Warfarin
A delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed when warfarin was administered 35 min after 
immediate-release exenatide. No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC were observed. Increased 
INR has been spontaneously reported during concomitant use of warfarin and prolonged-release 
exenatide. INR should be monitored during initiation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy in 
patients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
27
Hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors
Lovastatin AUC and Cmax were decreased approximately 40% and 28%, respectively, and tmax was 
delayed about 4 h when immediate-release exenatide was administered concomitantly with a single 
dose of lovastatin (40 mg) compared with lovastatin administered alone. In 30-week 
placebo-controlled clinical studies with immediate-release exenatide, concomitant use of exenatide 
and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles (see 
section 5.1). No predetermined dose adjustment is required; however, lipid profiles should be 
monitored as appropriate.
Digoxin and lisinopril
In interaction studies of the effect of immediate-release exenatide on digoxin and lisinopril there were 
no clinical relevant effects on Cmax or AUC, however, a delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed.
Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel
Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg 
levonorgestrel) one hour before immediate-release exenatide did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of 
either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 35 minutes after 
exenatide did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and 
Cmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The 
reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is 
required.
Paediatric population
Interaction studies with exenatide have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Due to the long washout period of prolonged-release exenatide, women of childbearing potential 
should use contraception during treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. This medicinal product 
should be discontinued at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of prolonged-release exenatide in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Prolonged-release exenatide should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is 
recommended. 
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether exenatide is excreted in human milk. Prolonged-release exenatide should not be 
used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
No fertility studies in humans have been conducted.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Prolonged-release exenatide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When
prolonged-release exenatide is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, patients should be advised to 
take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions in adults were mainly gastrointestinal related (nausea which was 
the most frequent reaction and associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over time, and 
diarrhoea). In addition, injection site reactions (pruritus, nodules, erythema), hypoglycaemia (with a 
28
sulphonylurea), and headache occurred. Most adverse reactions associated with prolonged-release 
exenatide were mild to moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The frequency of adverse reactions of prolonged-release exenatide identified from clinical studies and 
spontaneous reports in adults (not observed in clinical studies, frequency not known) are summarised 
in Table 1 below. 
In the prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies in adults, background therapies included diet and 
exercise, metformin, a sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of oral glucose-lowering 
medicinal products or a basal insulin. 
The reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to  1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia 
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP) with exenatide-dependent anti-platelet antibodies has been 
reported in adults in the postmarketing setting. DITP is an immune-mediated reaction that is caused by 
drug-dependent platelet-reactive antibodies. These antibodies cause destruction of platelets in the 
presence of the sensitizing drug.
Hypoglycaemia
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in adults
in combination with a sulphonylurea (24.0% versus 5.4%) (see section 4.4). To reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may 
be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Prolonged-release exenatide was associated with a significantly lower incidence of episodes of 
hypoglycaemia than basal insulin in patients also receiving metformin therapy (3% versus 19%) and in 
patients also receiving metformin plus sulphonylurea therapy (20% versus 42%).
Across 12 studies of prolonged-release exenatide most episodes (99.9% n = 649) of hypoglycaemia 
were minor, and resolved with oral administration of carbohydrate. One patient was reported with 
major hypoglycaemia since he had a low blood glucose value (2.2 mmol/L) and requested assistance 
with oral carbohydrate treatment which resolved the event.
When prolonged-release exenatide was added to basal insulin, no initial dose adjustment of insulin 
was required. Prolonged-release exenatide in combination with basal insulin showed no clinically 
significant differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin. There were no 
episodes of major hypoglycaemia in the prolonged-release exenatide with insulin group.
Nausea
The most frequently reported adverse reaction in adults was nausea. In patients treated with 
prolonged-release exenatide, generally 20% reported at least one episode of nausea compared to 34% 
of immediate-release exenatide patients. Most episodes of nausea were mild to moderate. With 
continued therapy, the frequency decreased in most patients who initially experienced nausea.
The incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events during the 30-week controlled study was 6% for 
prolonged-release exenatide treated patients, 5% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients. The 
most common adverse events leading to withdrawal in either treatment group were nausea and 
vomiting. Withdrawal due to nausea or vomiting each occurred in < 1% for prolonged-release 
exenatide treated patients and 1% for immediate-release exenatide treated patients.
Injection site reactions
Injection site reactions in adults were observed more frequently in prolonged-release exenatide treated 
patients versus comparator-treated patients (16% versus range of 2-7%) during the 6-month controlled 
phase of studies. These injection site reactions were generally mild and usually did not lead to 
withdrawal from studies. Patients may be treated to relieve symptoms, while continuing treatment. 
Subsequent injections should use a different site of injection each week. In postmarketing experiences, 
cases with injection site abscesses and cellulitis have been reported.
Small subcutaneous injection site nodules were observed very frequently in clinical studies, consistent
with the known properties of poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) polymer microsphere formulations. Most 
individual nodules were asymptomatic, did not interfere with study participation and resolved over 4 
to 8 weeks.
31
Immunogenicity
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, 
patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. In 
most patients who develop antibodies, antibody titres diminish over time. 
The presence of antibodies (high or low titres) is not predictive of glycaemic control for an individual 
patient.
In clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide in adults, approximately 45% of patients had low 
titre antibodies to exenatide at study endpoint. Overall the percentage of antibody positive patients was 
consistent across clinical studies. Overall, the level of glycaemic control (HbA1c) was comparable to 
that observed in those without antibody titres. On average in the phase 3 studies, 12% of the patients 
had higher titre antibodies. In a proportion of these the glycaemic response to prolonged-release 
exenatide was absent at the end of the controlled period of studies; 2.6% of patients showed no 
glucose improvement with higher titre antibodies whereas 1.6% showed no improvement while 
antibody negative.
Patients who developed antibodies to exenatide tend to have more injection site reactions (for 
example: redness of skin and itching), but otherwise similar rates and types of adverse events as those 
with no antibodies to exenatide.
For prolonged-release exenatide treated adult patients, the incidence of potentially immunogenic 
injection site reactions (most commonly pruritus with or without erythema) during the 30-week and 
the two 26-week studies was 9%. These reactions were less commonly observed in antibody-negative 
patients (4%) compared with antibody-positive patients (13%), with a greater incidence in those with 
higher titre antibodies.
Examination of antibody-positive specimens revealed no significant cross-reactivity with similar 
endogenous peptides (glucagon or GLP-1).
Rapid weight loss
In a 30-week study in adults, approximately 3% (n = 4/148) of prolonged-release exenatide treated 
patients experienced at least one time period of rapid weight loss (recorded body weight loss between 
two consecutive study visits of greater than 1.5 kg/week). 
Increased heart rate
A mean increase in heart rate (HR) of 2.6 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (74 bpm) was 
observed in pooled prolonged-release exenatide clinical studies in adults. Fifteen percent of 
prolonged-release exenatide treated patients had mean increases in HR of ≥ 10 bpm; approximately 
5% to 10% of subjects within the other treatment groups had mean increases in HR of ≥ 10 bpm. 
Paediatric population
The exenatide safety profile in a clinical study with adolescents and children aged 10 years or older
(see section 5.1) was similar to that observed in the studies in adults.
In the paediatric study there were no major hypoglycaemia events. 
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, one patient (1.7%) in the prolonged-release 
exenatide group and one patient (4.3%) in the placebo group had minor hypoglycaemia (defined as a 
non-major hypoglycaemia event that had symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and a glucose 
value less than 3 mmol/L [54 mg/dL] prior to treating the episode). Both patients were receiving 
insulin as background therapy.
Other hypoglycaemia events, episodes that did not meet either major or minor criteria, were reported 
by the investigator in 8 patients (13.6%) and 1 patient (4.3%) in the prolonged-release exenatide and 
placebo groups, respectively. Out of these, 6 patients in the prolonged-release exenatide group and 
1 patient in the placebo group received insulin as background therapy.
32
In the paediatric study the maximum antibody titre obtained at any time during the study was low 
(<625) for approximately 30% of patients and high (≥625) for approximately 63% of patients. The 
percentage of patients with positive antibody titres peaked at approximately Week 12. As the study 
continued to Week 52 the percentage of patients with high titres had decreased (31%) and percentage 
of the patients with low titres (40%) had increased. Patients with higher titre antibodies may have an 
attenuated HbA1c response (see section 4.4).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Effects of overdoses with exenatide (based on immediate-release exenatide clinical studies) included 
severe nausea, severe vomiting and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations. In the event of 
overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs 
and symptoms.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC 
code: A10BJ01.
Mechanism of action
Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that exhibits several 
antihyperglycaemic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The amino acid sequence of 
exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate 
the known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, its mechanism of action mediated by cyclic AMP and/or 
other intracellular signalling pathways. 
Exenatide increases, on a glucose-dependent basis, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. 
As blood glucose concentrations decrease, insulin secretion subsides. When exenatide was used in 
combination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, no increase in the incidence of 
hypoglycaemia was observed over that of placebo in combination with metformin and/or a 
thiazolidinedione which may be due to this glucose-dependent insulinotropic mechanism (see section 
4.4).
Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. 
However, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response and other hormone responses to 
hypoglycaemia. 
Exenatide slows gastric emptying thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in 
the circulation. 
Administration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake, due to decreased appetite and 
increased satiety.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Exenatide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering both postprandial and 
fasting glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike native GLP-1, prolonged-

release exenatide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once 
weekly administration.
A pharmacodynamic study with exenatide demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) a 
restoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to 
an intravenous bolus of glucose.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The results of long-term clinical studies of prolonged-release exenatide are presented below; these 
studies comprised 1356 adult subjects treated with prolonged-release exenatide, 52% men and 48% 
women, 230 subjects (17%) were ≥ 65 years of age.
In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (EXSCEL) enrolled 
14,752 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual 
care.
Glycaemic control
In two studies in adults prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly has been compared to
immediate-release exenatide 5 mcg given twice daily for 4 weeks followed by immediate-release 
exenatide 10 mcg given twice daily. One study was of 24 weeks in duration (n = 252) and the other of 
30 weeks (n = 295) followed by an open-labelled extension where all patients were treated with 
prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly for a further 7 years (n = 258). In both studies, 
decreases in HbA1c were evident in both treatment groups as early as the first post-treatment HbA1c
measurement (Weeks 4 or 6).
Prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to 
patients receiving immediate-release exenatide (Table 2).
A clinically relevant effect of prolonged-release exenatide and immediate-release exenatide treated 
subjects was observed on HbA1c, regardless of the background anti-diabetic therapy in both studies.
Clinically and statistically significantly more subjects on prolonged-release compared to 
immediate-release exenatide patients achieved an HbA1c reduction of ≤ 7% or < 7% in the two studies 
(p < 0.05 and p ≤ 0.0001, respectively).
Both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight 
compared to baseline, although the difference between the two treatment arms was not significant. 
In the uncontrolled study extension, evaluable patients who switched from immediate release to 
prolonged-release exenatide at Week 30 (n = 121), achieved the same improvement in HbA1c of -2.0% 
at Week 52 compared to baseline as patients treated with prolonged-release exenatide.
For all patients completing the uncontrolled study extension of 7 years (n = 122 of 258 patients 
included in the extension phase), HbA1c gradually increased over time from Week 52 onwards, but 
was still reduced compared to baseline after 7 years (-1.5%). Weight loss was sustained over 7 years in 
these patients.

A study of 26-week duration has been conducted in adults, in which prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg 
is compared to insulin glargine once daily. Compared with insulin glargine treatment, prolonged-
release exenatide demonstrated a superior change in HbA1c, significantly lowered mean body weight 
and was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events (Table 3).

1 Insulin glargine was dosed to a target glucose concentration of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/L (72 to 100 mg/dL). 
The mean dose of insulin glargine at the beginning of treatment was 10.1 IU/day rising to 31.1 IU/day 
for insulin glargine-treated patients.
The 156-week results were consistent with those previously reported in the 26-week interim report. 
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide persistently significantly improved glycaemic control and 
weight control, compared to the insulin glargine treatment. Safety findings at 156 weeks were 
consistent with those reported at 26 weeks.
In a 26-week double-blind study prolonged-release exenatide was compared to maximum daily doses 
of sitagliptin and pioglitazone in adult subjects also using metformin. All treatment groups had a 
significant reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. Prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated 
superiority to both sitagliptin and pioglitazone with respect to change in HbA1c from baseline.
Prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly greater weight reductions compared to 
sitagliptin. Patients on pioglitazone gained weight (Table 4).

In a 28-week, double-blind study in adults, the combination of prolonged-release exenatide and 
dapagliflozin was compared to prolonged-release exenatide alone and dapagliflozin alone in subjects 
also using metformin. All treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. The 
prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin treatment group showed superior reductions in HbA1c 
from baseline compared to prolonged-release exenatide alone and dapagliflozin alone (Table 5).
The combination of prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin demonstrated significantly greater 
weight reductions compared to either medicinal product alone (Table 5).

Cardiovascular evaluation
EXSCEL was a pragmatic cardiovascular (CV) outcome study in adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
and any level of CV risk. A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged-release 
exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 
inhibitors. Patients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a 
median treatment duration of 27.8 months. The vital status was known at the end of the study for 
98.9% and 98.8% of the patients in the prolonged-release exenatide and placebo group, respectively. 
The mean age at study entry was 62 years (with 8.5% of the patients ≥ 75 years). Approximately 62% 
of the patients were male. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 
13.1 years. The mean HbA1c was 8.1%. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to ≤ 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal 
39
impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, 26.9% of patients did not have any prior 
CV event, 73.1% had at least one prior CV event.
The primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to 
first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV)-related death, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint 
assessed. 
Prolonged-release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; 
P < 0.001 for non-inferiority) see Figure 1. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis in EXSCEL, the HR 
for MACE was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77–0.97) in patients with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
1.01 (95% CI: 0.86–1.19) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The results of the 
primary composite and secondary cardiovascular endpoints are shown in Figure 2.

The need for additional antihyperglycaemic medication was reduced by 33% with the prolonged-
release exenatide group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 10.5 per 100 pt-year) compared to the placebo 
group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 15.7 per 100 pt-year). A reduction in HbA1c was observed over 
the course of the trial with an overall treatment difference of -0.53% (prolonged-release exenatide vs. 
placebo).
Body weight
A reduction in body weight compared to baseline has been observed in all prolonged-release exenatide 
studies. In the 4 comparator-controlled studies, this reduction in body weight was seen in patients 
treated with prolonged-release exenatide irrespective of the occurrence of nausea although the 
reduction was larger in the group with nausea (mean reduction of -2.9 kg to -5.2 kg with nausea 
versus -2.2 kg to -2.9 kg without nausea).
In the 4 comparator-controlled studies, the proportion of patients who had both a reduction in weight 
and HbA1c ranged from 70 to 79% (the proportion of patients who had a reduction of HbA1c ranged 
from 88 to 96%). 
Plasma/serum glucose
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma/serum 
glucose concentrations, these reductions were observed as early as 4 weeks. In the placebo-controlled 
study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in fasting plasma glucose 
was -0.7 mmol/L for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.1 mmol/L for the placebo group. 
Additional reductions in postprandial concentrations were also observed. The improvement in fasting 
plasma glucose concentrations was durable through 52 weeks.
Beta-cell function 
Clinical studies with prolonged-release exenatide have indicated improved beta-cell function, using 
measures such as the homeostasis model assessments (HOMA-B). The durability of effect on beta-cell 
function was maintained through 52 weeks.
41
Blood pressure
A reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the 4 comparator-controlled prolonged-release 
exenatide studies (2.9 mmHg to 4.7 mmHg). In the 30-week immediate-release exenatide comparator 
study both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide significantly reduced systolic blood 
pressure from baseline (4.7±1.1 mmHg and 3.4±1.1 mmHg, respectively); the difference between the 
treatments was not significant. Improvements in blood pressure were maintained through 52 weeks.
In the placebo-controlled study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in systolic 
blood pressure was -2.6 mmHg for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.7 mmHg for the 
placebo group.
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin combination at Week 28 resulted in a 
significant mean change reduction of -4.3±0.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to 
prolonged-release exenatide alone of -1.2±0.8 mmHg (p < 0.01) or to dapagliflozin alone of -1.8±0.8
mmHg (p < 0.05).
Fasting lipids
Prolonged-release exenatide has shown no negative effects on lipid parameters. 
Paediatric population
The efficacy and safety of prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo was evaluated in 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adolescents and children aged 
10 years and above with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a 
stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. The prolonged-release exenatide was superior to 
placebo in reducing HbA1c after 24 weeks (Table 7).

Pharmacokinetic properties
The absorption properties of exenatide reflect the extended release properties of the prolonged-release 
exenatide formulation. Once absorbed into the circulation, exenatide is distributed and eliminated 
according to its known systemic pharmacokinetic properties (as described in this section).
Absorption
Following weekly administration of 2 mg prolonged-release exenatide, mean exenatide concentrations 
exceeded minimal efficacious concentrations (~ 50 pg/mL) in 2 weeks with gradual increase in the 
average plasma exenatide concentration over 6 to 7 weeks. Subsequently, exenatide concentrations of 
approximately 151-265 pg/mL were maintained indicating that steady state was achieved. Steady-state 
exenatide concentrations are maintained during the one-week interval between doses with minimal 
peak to trough fluctuation from this average therapeutic concentration.
Distribution
The mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following subcutaneous administration of a 
single dose of exenatide is 28 L.
Biotransformation and elimination
Nonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration 
with subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide is 9 L/h. These 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks 
after discontinuation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, mean plasma exenatide concentrations 
fell below minimal detectable concentrations.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of renal impaired patients receiving 2 mg prolonged-release 
exenatide indicate that there may be an increase in systemic exposure of approximately 74% and 23% 
(median prediction in each group) in moderate (N = 10) and mild (N = 56) renal impaired patients, 
respectively, as compared to normal (N = 84) renal function patients. 
Hepatic insufficiency
No pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Exenatide is 
cleared primarily by the kidney, therefore hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood 
concentrations of exenatide.
Gender, race and body weight
Gender, race and body weight have no clinically relevant influence on exenatide pharmacokinetics. 
Elderly
Data in elderly are limited, but suggest no marked changes in exenatide exposure with increased age 
up to about 75 years old. 
In a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
administration of exenatide (10 mcg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 
43
elderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to 
reduced renal function in the older age group (see section 4.2).
Paediatric population
The population pharmacokinetic analysis in adolescents and children with low ADA titre aged 10 
years and above with type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated that administration of exenatide extended-
release (2 mg) resulted in exposure similar to that observed in adults.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity conducted with immediate-release or 
prolonged-release exenatide. 
Thyroid tumours have been observed in rats and mice with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a 
2-year rat carcinogenicity study with prolonged-release exenatide, an increased incidence of C-cell 
adenomas and C-cell carcinomas was observed at doses ≥ 2-fold the human systemic exposure based 
on AUC. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown.
Animal studies with exenatide did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility; high doses of 
exenatide caused skeletal effects and reduced foetal and neonatal growth.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Bydureon is indicated in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products 
including basal insulin, when the therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control.
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose is 2 mg exenatide once weekly. 
Patients switching from immediate-release exenatide (Byetta) to prolonged-release exenatide 
(Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may experience transient elevations in blood glucose concentrations, 
which generally improve within the first four weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients switching 
between the prolonged-release exenatide products (Bydureon or Bydureon BCise) may do so, with no 
expected relevant effect on blood glucose concentrations.
When prolonged-release exenatide is added to existing metformin and/or thiazolidinedione therapy, 
the current dose of metformin and/or thiazolidinedione can be continued. When added to 
sulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). Combination therapy with thiazolidinedione was only studied 
in adult patients.
Prolonged-release exenatide should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day 
of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered at least 
three days before. Prolonged-release exenatide can be administered at any time of day, with or without 
meals. 
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as practical, provided the next regularly 
scheduled dose is due in 3 days or more. Thereafter, patients can resume their usual once weekly 
dosing schedule. 
47
If a dose is missed and the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later, the patient should not 
administer the missed dose, but instead resume prolonged-release exenatide on the next regularly 
scheduled dosing day.
The use of this medicinal product does not require additional self-monitoring. Blood glucose self-
monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and of insulin, particularly when 
prolonged-release exenatide therapy is started and insulin is reduced. A stepwise approach to insulin 
dose reduction is recommended. 
If a different glucose-lowering treatment is started after the discontinuation of prolonged-release 
exenatide, consideration should be given to the prolonged release of the product (see section 5.2).
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required based on age. However, as renal function generally declines with age, 
consideration should be given to the patient’s renal function (see Renal impairment) (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Prolonged-release exenatide is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or 
severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30mL/min) (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
No dose adjustment is required for adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. No data are 
available for children below 10 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Method of administration
Subcutaneous use
Prolonged-release exenatide is for self-administration by the patient. Each pen can only be used by one 
person and is for single use. 
Prior to initiation of prolonged-release exenatide, it is strongly recommended that patients and 
caregivers be trained by their healthcare professional. The “Instructions for the User”, provided in the 
carton, must be followed carefully.
Each dose should be administered in the abdomen, thigh, or the back of the upper arm as a 
subcutaneous injection immediately after the medicinal product is fully mixed. 
When used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate 
injections.
For instructions on the preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
the “Instructions for the User”.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Prolonged-release exenatide should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the 
treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
48
Prolonged-release exenatide is not a substitute for insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in 
insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). 
Prolonged-release exenatide must not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection.
Renal impairment
In patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, single doses of immediate-release exenatide 
increased frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions; therefore, prolonged-release 
exenatide formulations are not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease or severe 
renal impairment (GFR < 30mL/min). 
There have been uncommon events of altered renal function with exenatide, including increased serum 
creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes 
requiring haemodialysis. Some of these events occurred in patients experiencing events that may affect 
hydration, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and/or receiving medicinal products known to 
affect renal function/hydration status. Concomitant medicinal products included angiotensin 
converting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal 
products and diuretics. Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed with supportive 
treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative medicinal products, including exenatide.
Severe gastrointestinal disease
Prolonged-release exenatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, 
including gastroparesis. Its use is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, 
including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Therefore, the use of this medicinal product is not 
recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.
Acute pancreatitis
Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. In 
clinical studies of Bydureon BCise, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.4% of patients. There have been 
spontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis with prolonged-release exenatide. Resolution of 
pancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment, but very rare cases of necrotising or 
haemorrhagic pancreatitis and/or death have been reported. Patients should be informed of the 
characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, the use of this medicinal product should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, 
it should not be restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.
Concomitant medicinal products
The concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide formulations with D-phenylalanine derivatives 
(meglitinides), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor 
agonists has not been studied. The concurrent use of a formulation of prolonged-release and 
immediate-release exenatide has not been studied and is not recommended.
Lack of efficacy due to anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in paediatric patients
Paediatric patients are possibly more prone to developing high titers of ADA than adults (see section 
4.8). Patients with higher titre antibodies may have an attenuated HbA1c response.
No commercial testing of anti-drug antibodies is available, but if targeted glycaemic control is not 
achieved despite confirmed patient compliance, regardless of the reason for the lack of efficacy, 
physicians should consider alternative antidiabetic therapy.
Interaction with warfarin
There have been spontaneously reported cases of increased INR (International Normalized Ratio), 
sometimes associated with bleeding, with concomitant use of warfarin and exenatide (see section 4.5).
Hypoglycaemia
The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased when prolonged-release exenatide was used in combination 
with a sulphonylurea in clinical studies. Furthermore, in the clinical studies, patients on a 
49
sulphonylurea combination with mild renal impairment had an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia 
compared to patients with normal renal function. To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with 
the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.
Rapid weight loss
Rapid weight loss at a rate of > 1.5 kg per week has been reported in patients treated with exenatide. 
Weight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences. Patients with rapid weight loss should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of cholelithiasis.
Discontinuation of treatment
After discontinuation, the effect of prolonged-release exenatide may continue as plasma levels of 
exenatide decline over 10 weeks. Choice of other medicinal products and dose selection should be 
considered accordingly, as adverse reactions may continue and efficacy may, at least partly, persist 
until exenatide levels decline.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Sulphonylureas
The dose of a sulphonylurea may require adjustment due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia 
associated with sulphonylurea therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Gastric emptying
The results of a study using paracetamol as a marker of gastric emptying suggest that the effect of 
prolonged-release exenatide to slow gastric emptying is minor and not expected to cause clinically 
significant reductions in the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral 
medicinal products. Therefore, no dose adjustments for medicinal products sensitive to delayed gastric 
emptying are required.
When 1,000 mg paracetamol tablets were administered, either with or without a meal, following 
14 weeks of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, no significant changes in paracetamol AUC were 
observed compared to the control period. Paracetamol Cmax decreased by 16% (fasting) and 5% (fed) 
and tmax was increased from approximately 1 hour in the control period to 1.4 hours (fasting) and 
1.3 hours (fed). 
The following interaction studies have been conducted using 10 mcg immediate-release exenatide but 
not prolonged-release exenatide formulations:
Warfarin
A delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed when warfarin was administered 35 min after 
immediate-release exenatide. No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC were observed. Increased 
INR has been spontaneously reported during concomitant use of warfarin and prolonged-release 
exenatide. INR should be monitored during initiation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy in 
patients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors
Lovastatin AUC and Cmax were decreased approximately 40% and 28%, respectively, and tmax was 
delayed about 4 h when immediate-release exenatide was administered concomitantly with a single 
dose of lovastatin (40 mg) compared with lovastatin administered alone. In 30-week 
placebo-controlled clinical studies with immediate-release exenatide, concomitant use of exenatide 
and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles (see 
section 5.1). No predetermined dose adjustment is required; however, lipid profiles should be 
monitored as appropriate.
Digoxin and lisinopril
In interaction studies of the effect of immediate-release exenatide on digoxin and lisinopril there were 
no clinical relevant effects on Cmax or AUC, however, a delay in tmax of about 2 h was observed. 
50
Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel
Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg 
levonorgestrel) one hour before immediate-release exenatide did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of 
either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 35 minutes after 
exenatide did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and 
Cmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The 
reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is 
required.
Paediatric population
Interaction studies with exenatide have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential
Due to the long washout period of prolonged-release exenatide, women of childbearing potential 
should use contraception during treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. This medicine should be 
discontinued at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of prolonged-release exenatide in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Prolonged-release exenatide should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is 
recommended. 
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether exenatide is excreted in human milk. Prolonged-release exenatide should not be 
used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
No fertility studies in humans have been conducted.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Prolonged-release exenatide has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. When used 
in combination with a sulphonylurea, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid 
hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequent adverse reactions during the clinical studies in adults were gastrointestinal-related 
(mainly nausea (8%), which tended to dissipate with continued treatment), headache (4%) and 
injection site reactions, such as injection site pruritus (3%) and injection site erythema (2%). In 
addition, hypoglycaemia with a sulphonylurea occurred very commonly (see Description of selected 
adverse reactions, below). Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The frequency of adverse reactions of Bydureon BCise identified from clinical studies in adults are 
summarised in Table 1 below.
The pooled clinical studies data set for Bydureon BCise comprises two phase 3 comparator-controlled 
studies of 6 to 12 months duration in adults. The follow-up and extension phases of studies are 
included in the pool. Background therapies included diet and exercise alone or with metformin, a 
sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione or a combination of oral glucose-lowering medicinal products. 
Adverse reactions that have been observed with the prolonged-release exenatide but not in clinical 
studies with Bydureon BCise are also included in Table 1. 
51
Background therapies in the prolonged-release exenatide clinical trials included diet and exercise, 
metformin, a sulphonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of oral glucose-lowering agents or a 
basal insulin. 
The reactions are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to  1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) very rare (< 1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia 
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP) with exenatide-dependent anti-platelet antibodies has been 
reported in adults in the postmarketing setting. DITP is an immune-mediated reaction that is caused by 
drug-dependent platelet-reactive antibodies. These antibodies cause destruction of platelets in the 
presence of the sensitizing drug.
Hypoglycaemia
There were no events of major hypoglycaemia with Bydureon BCise in clinical studies in adults. The 
overall incidence of minor hypoglycaemia was 6.3%. This incidence was increased when it was used 
in combination with a sulphonylurea (26.1%) compared to no sulphonylurea (0.9%) (see section 4.4). 
To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose 
of sulphonylurea may be considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
When prolonged-release exenatide was added to basal insulin, no initial dose adjustment of insulin 
was required. Prolonged-release exenatide in combination with basal insulin showed no clinically 
significant differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin. There were no 
episodes of major hypoglycaemia in the prolonged-release exenatide with insulin group.
Nausea
The most frequently reported gastrointestinal adverse reaction in adults was nausea. During the 
controlled period of the clinical study comparing Bydureon BCise with immediate-release exenatide, 
nausea was reported in 9.6% and 20.5% of patients in each group. Overall, 9.3% of patients treated 
with Bydureon BCise reported nausea during the controlled period of both clinical studies. Most 
episodes of nausea were mild to moderate, associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased 
over time.
Injection site reactions
During the controlled period of the clinical studies in adults, injection site reactions were observed 
more frequently in patients treated with Bydureon BCise versus comparator-treated patients (24% 
versus 4% with immediate-release exenatide). These injection site reactions were generally mild and 
usually did not lead to discontinuation of study medication. Patients may be treated to relieve 
symptoms, while continuing treatment. Subsequent injections should use a different site of injection 
each week. In postmarketing experience with prolonged-release exenatide, cases with injection site 
abscesses and cellulitis have been reported.
Subcutaneous injection site nodules were observed frequently in clinical studies, consistent with the 
known properties of poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) polymer microsphere formulations. Most 
individual nodules did not interfere with study participation and resolved over time.
Immunogenicity
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, 
patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with prolonged-release exenatide. 
Approximately 42% of patients developed low titre antibodies to exenatide and 32% of patients 
developed high titre antibodies at any time during the studies in adults. The percentage of these 
subjects with positive antibody titres, in particular high titres, peaked at approximately weeks 8 to 16 
of dosing and then diminished over time. At the study endpoint, approximately 43% of patients had 
low titre antibodies to exenatide and 14% of patients had high titre antibodies. Overall, the level of 
glycaemic control (HbA1c) in patients treated with Bydureon BCise with low titre antibodies at the last 
visit (-1.1% to -1.5%) was comparable to that observed in those without antibody titres (-1.1% 
to -1.4%). While patients with high titre antibodies at the last visit had an attenuated HbA1c response, 
HbA1c reductions in these patients were clinically relevant (-0.6% to -0.7%).
54
Amongst adult patients treated with Bydureon BCise evaluable for antibodies (N = 393), the incidence 
of potentially immunogenic injection site reactions (most commonly injection site nodule) during the 
two studies was approximately 20%. These reactions were less commonly observed in 
antibody-negative patients (16%) and patients with low titre antibodies (16%) compared with those 
with high titre antibodies (27%).
Rapid weight loss
In a 30-week study in adults, approximately 3% (n = 4/148) of prolonged-release exenatide treated 
patients experienced at least one-time period of rapid weight loss (recorded body weight loss between 
two consecutive study visits of greater than 1.5 kg/week).
Increased heart rate
A mean increase in heart rate (HR) of 2.4 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (74 bpm) was 
observed in the controlled period of the Bydureon BCise clinical studies in adults. Fifteen percent of 
prolonged-release exenatide treated patients had mean increases in HR of ≥ 10 bpm; approximately 
5% to 10% of subjects within the other treatment groups had mean increases in HR of ≥ 10 bpm.
Paediatric population
The exenatide safety profile in a clinical study with adolescents and children aged 10 years or older 
(see section 5.1) was similar to that observed in the studies in adults.
In the paediatric study there were no major hypoglycaemia events. 
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, one patient (1.7%) in the prolonged-release 
exenatide group and one patient (4.3%) in the placebo group had minor hypoglycaemia (defined as a
non-major hypoglycaemia event that had symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and a glucose 
value less than 3 mmol/L [54 mg/dL] prior to treating the episode). Both patients were receiving 
insulin as background therapy.
Other hypoglycaemia events, episodes that did not meet either major or minor criteria, were reported 
by the investigator in 8 patients (13.6%) and 1 patient (4.3%) in the prolonged-release exenatide and 
placebo groups, respectively. Out of these, 6 patients in the prolonged-release exenatide group and
1 patient in the placebo group received insulin as background therapy.
In the paediatric study the maximum antibody titre obtained at any time during the study was low 
(<625) for approximately 30% of patients and high (≥625) for approximately 63% of patients. The 
percentage of patients with positive antibody titres peaked at approximately Week 12. As the study 
continued to Week 52 the percentage of patients with high titres had decreased (31%) and percentage 
of the patients with low titres (40%) had increased. Patients with higher titre antibodies may have an 
attenuated HbA1c response (see section 4.4).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Effects of overdoses with exenatide (based on immediate-release exenatide clinical studies) included 
severe nausea, severe vomiting and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations. In the event of 
overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient’s clinical signs 
and symptoms.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
55
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, ATC 
code: A10BJ01.
Mechanism of action
Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that exhibits several 
antihyperglycaemic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The amino acid sequence of 
exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate 
the known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, its mechanism of action mediated by cyclic AMP and/or 
other intracellular signalling pathways. 
Exenatide increases, on a glucose-dependent basis, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. 
As blood glucose concentrations decrease, insulin secretion subsides. When exenatide was used in 
combination with metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione, no increase in the incidence of 
hypoglycaemia was observed over that of placebo in combination with metformin and/or a 
thiazolidinedione which may be due to this glucose-dependent insulinotropic mechanism (see section 
4.4).
Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion which is known to be inappropriately elevated in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output. 
However, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response and other hormone responses to 
hypoglycaemia. 
Exenatide slows gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in 
the circulation.
Administration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake, due to decreased appetite and 
increased satiety.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Exenatide improves glycaemic control through the sustained effects of lowering both postprandial and 
fasting glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unlike native GLP-1, prolonged-
release exenatide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile in humans suitable for once 
weekly administration.
A pharmacodynamic study with exenatide demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 13) a 
restoration of first phase insulin secretion and improved second phase insulin secretion in response to 
an intravenous bolus of glucose.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The results of two studies with Bydureon BCise and six long-term clinical studies of prolonged-release 
exenatide are presented below; these studies comprised 1766 adult subjects (556 treated with 
Bydureon BCise), 53% men and 47% women, 304 subjects (17%) were ≥ 65 years of age.
In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome study (EXSCEL) enrolled 
14,752 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual 
care.
Glycaemic control
Bydureon BCise
In a 28-week open-label study in adults, Bydureon BCise was compared to immediate-release 
exenatide in subjects on a diet and exercise programme alone or with a stable regimen of oral 
glucose-lowering medicinal products. Both treatment groups had a reduction in HbA1c compared to 
baseline. Bydureon BCise demonstrated superiority to immediate-release exenatide in reducing HbA1c
from baseline to Week 28 (Table 2). The 28-week comparator-controlled period of the study was 
56
followed by a 24-week extension period during which all participating subjects received treatment 
with this medicinal product. The effect on HbA1c remained clinically significant over 52 weeks but 
partially diminished over time in the group that had initially received Bydureon BCise.
Both Bydureon BCise and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight at 
Week 28 compared to baseline (Table 2). The difference between the two treatment groups was not 
significant. The reductions in body weight were sustained at Week 52.

Prolonged-release exenatide
In two studies in adults prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly has been compared to 
immediate-release exenatide 5 mcg given twice daily for 4 weeks followed by immediate-release 
exenatide 10 mcg given twice daily. One study was of 24 weeks in duration (n = 252) and the other of 
30 weeks (n = 295) followed by an open labelled extension where all patients were treated with 
prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly, for a further 7 years (n = 258). In both studies, 
decreases in HbA1c were evident in both treatment groups as early as the first post-treatment HbA1c
measurement (Weeks 4 or 6).
Prolonged-release exenatide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to 
patients receiving immediate-release exenatide (Table 4).
A clinically relevant effect of prolonged-release exenatide and immediate-release exenatide treated 
subjects was observed on HbA1c, regardless of the background anti-diabetic therapy in both studies.
Clinically and statistically significantly more subjects on prolonged-release compared to 
immediate-release exenatide patients achieved an HbA1c reduction of ≤ 7% or < 7% in the two studies 
(p < 0.05 and p ≤ 0.0001, respectively). 
Both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide patients achieved a reduction in weight 
compared to baseline, although the difference between the two treatment arms was not significant. 
In the uncontrolled study extension, evaluable patients who switched from immediate release to 
prolonged-release exenatide at week 30 (n = 121), achieved the same improvement in HbA1c of -2.0% 
at Week 52 compared to baseline as patients treated with prolonged-release exenatide.
For all patients completing the uncontrolled study extension of 7 years (n = 122 of 258 patients 
included in the extension phase), HbA1c gradually increased over time from week 52 onwards, but was 
58
still reduced compared to baseline after 7 years -1.5%). Weight loss was sustained over 7 years in 
these patients.

A study of 26-week duration has been conducted in adults, in which prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg 
is compared to insulin glargine once daily. Compared with insulin glargine treatment, prolonged-
release exenatide demonstrated a superior change in HbA1c, significantly lowered mean body weight 
and was associated with fewer hypoglycaemic events (Table 5).

1 Insulin glargine was dosed to a target glucose concentration of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/L (72 to 100 mg/dL).
The mean dose of insulin glargine at the beginning of treatment was 10.1 IU/day rising to 31.1 IU/day 
for insulin glargine-treated patients.
The 156-week results were consistent with those previously reported in the 26-week interim report. 
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide persistently significantly improved glycaemic control and 
weight control, compared to the insulin glargine treatment. Safety findings at 156 weeks were 
consistent with those reported at 26 weeks.
In a 26-week double-blind study prolonged-release exenatide was compared to maximum daily doses 
of sitagliptin and pioglitazone in adult subjects also using metformin. All treatment groups had a 
significant reduction in HbA1c compared to baseline. Prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated 
superiority to both sitagliptin and pioglitazone with respect to change in HbA1c from baseline. 
Prolonged-release exenatide demonstrated significantly greater weight reductions compared to 
sitagliptin. Patients on pioglitazone gained weight (Table 6).

Cardiovascular evaluation
EXSCEL was a pragmatic cardiovascular (CV) outcome study in adult patients with type 2 diabetes 
and any level of CV risk. A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged-release 
exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 
inhibitors. Patients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a 
median treatment duration of 27.8 months. The vital status was known at the end of the study for 
98.9% and 98.8% of the patients in the prolonged-release exenatide and placebo group, respectively. 
The mean age at study entry was 62 years (with 8.5% of the patients ≥ 75 years). Approximately 62% 
of the patients were male. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 
63
13.1 years. The mean HbA1c was 8.1%. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to ≤ 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, 26.9% of patients did not have any prior 
CV event, 73.1% had at least one prior CV event.
The primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to 
first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV)-related death, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint 
assessed. 
Prolonged-release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; 
P < 0.001 for non-inferiority) see Figure 1. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis in EXSCEL, the HR 
for MACE was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77–0.97) in patients with baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
1.01 (95% CI: 0.86–1.19) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The results of the 
primary composite and secondary cardiovascular endpoints are shown in Figure 2.

release exenatide group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 10.5 per 100 pt-year) compared to the placebo 
group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 15.7 per 100 pt-year). A reduction in HbA1c was observed over 
the course of the trial with an overall treatment difference of -0.53% (prolonged-release exenatide vs. 
placebo).
Body weight
A reduction in body weight compared to baseline has been observed in studies with prolonged-release 
exenatide formulations. This reduction in body weight was seen irrespective of the occurrence of 
nausea although the reduction was larger in the group with nausea (mean reduction of -1.9 kg 
to -5.2 kg with nausea versus -1.0 kg to -2.9 kg without nausea). 
Plasma/serum glucose
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma/serum 
glucose concentrations, these reductions were observed as early as 4 weeks. In the placebo-controlled 
study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in fasting plasma glucose 
was -0.7 mmol/L for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.1 mmol/L for the placebo group. 
Additional reductions in postprandial concentrations were also observed. 
For both prolonged-release exenatide formulations, the improvement in fasting plasma glucose 
concentrations was sustained through 52 weeks.
Beta-cell function
Clinical studies with prolonged-release exenatide formulations have indicated improved beta-cell 
function, using measures such as the homeostasis model assessments (HOMA-B). The effect on 
beta-cell function was sustained through 52 weeks.
Blood pressure
A reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the studies with prolonged-release exenatide 
formulations (0.8 mmHg to 4.7 mmHg). In the 30-week immediate-release exenatide comparator 
study both prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide significantly reduced systolic blood 
pressure from baseline (4.7±1.1 mmHg and 3.4±1.1 mmHg, respectively); the difference between the 
treatments was not significant. Improvements in blood pressure were maintained through 52 weeks.
65
In the placebo-controlled study with insulin glargine, the change from baseline to Week 28 in systolic 
blood pressure was -2.6 mmHg for the prolonged-release exenatide group and -0.7 mmHg for the 
placebo group.
Treatment with prolonged-release exenatide and dapagliflozin combination at Week 28 resulted in a 
significant mean change reduction of -4.3±0.8 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to 
prolonged-release exenatide alone of -1.2±0.8 mmHg (p < 0.01) or to dapagliflozin alone of -1.8±0.8
mmHg (p < 0.05).
Fasting lipids
The prolonged-release exenatide formulations have shown no negative effects on lipid parameters. 
Paediatric population
The efficacy and safety of prolonged-release exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo was evaluated in 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adolescents and children aged 
10 years and above with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a 
stable dose of oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. The prolonged-release exenatide was superior to 
placebo in reducing HbA1c after 24 weeks (Table 9).

5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The absorption properties of exenatide reflect the extended release properties of the prolonged-release 
exenatide formulation. Once absorbed into the circulation, exenatide is distributed and eliminated 
according to its known systemic pharmacokinetic properties (as described in this section).
Absorption
Following weekly administration of 2 mg Bydureon BCise, mean exenatide concentrations exceeded 
minimal efficacious concentrations (~ 50 pg/mL) in 2 weeks with gradual increase in the average 
plasma exenatide concentration up to Week 8. Subsequently, exenatide concentrations of 
approximately 153-208 pg/mL were maintained, indicating that steady state was achieved. 
Steady-state exenatide concentrations are maintained during the one-week interval between doses with 
minimal peak to trough fluctuation from this average therapeutic concentration.
Distribution
The mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following subcutaneous administration of a 
single dose of exenatide is 28 L.
Biotransformation and elimination
Nonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration 
with subsequent proteolytic degradation. The mean apparent clearance of exenatide is 9 L/h. These 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose. Approximately 10 weeks 
after discontinuation of prolonged-release exenatide therapy, mean plasma exenatide concentrations 
fell below minimal detectable concentrations.
Special populations
Renal impairment
No clinically meaningful differences were observed in steady state exenatide concentrations or 
tolerability in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2) 
receiving Bydureon BCise, compared to those with normal renal function.
Hepatic insufficiency
No pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Exenatide is 
cleared primarily by the kidney; therefore hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood 
concentrations of exenatide.
Gender, race and body weight
Gender, race and body weight have no clinically relevant influence on exenatide pharmacokinetics. 
Elderly
Data in elderly are limited, but suggest no marked changes in exenatide exposure with increased age 
up to about 75 years old.
In a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
administration of exenatide (10 mcg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 
elderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to 
reduced renal function in the older age group (see section 4.2).
Paediatric population
The population pharmacokinetic analysis in adolescents and children with low ADA titre aged 10 
years and above with type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated that administration of prolonged-release 
exenatide (2 mg) resulted in exposure similar to that observed in adults.
67
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, or genotoxicity conducted with immediate-release exenatide or 
prolonged-release exenatide formulations.
Thyroid tumours have been observed in rats and mice with long acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. In a 
2-year rat carcinogenicity study with prolonged-release exenatide, an increased incidence of C-cell 
adenomas and C-cell carcinomas was observed at doses ≥ 2-fold the human systemic exposure based 
on AUC. The clinical relevance of these findings is currently unknown. 
Animal studies with exenatide did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility; high doses of 
exenatide caused skeletal effects and reduced foetal and neonatal growth.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Bydureon is and what it is used for
Bydureon contains the active substance exenatide. It is an injectable medicine used to improve blood 
sugar control in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
This medicine is used in combination with the following diabetes medicines: metformin, 
sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones (combination therapy with thiazolidinedione was only studied in 
adult patients), SGLT2 inhibitors and/or a long-acting insulin. Your doctor is now prescribing this 
medicine as an additional medicine to help control your blood sugar. Continue to follow your food and 
exercise plan.
You have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in 
your blood or your body is not able to use the insulin properly. This medicine helps your body to 
increase the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. 
2. What you need to know before you use Bydureon
Do not use Bydureon:
-
If you are allergic to exenatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse before using Bydureon about the following:
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar 
-
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Test your blood glucose levels regularly. Ask your doctor, 
pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure if any of your other medicines contain a 
sulphonylurea.
If you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as this medicine should not be used.
How to inject this medicine. It should be injected into the skin and not into a vein or into the 
muscle. 
-
-
105
-
-
-
-
If you have severe problems with your stomach emptying (including gastroparesis) or food 
digestion, as the use of this medicine is not recommended. The active substance in this medicine 
slows stomach emptying so food passes more slowly through your stomach.
If you have ever had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) (see section 4).
If you lose weight too quickly (more than 1.5 kg per week) talk to your doctor about it since this 
may cause problems such as gallstones.
If you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis, as the use of this medicine is not 
recommended.
Bydureon is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. 
Children and adolescents
Bydureon can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. There is no data available 
for use of this medicine in children below 10 years of age.
Other medicines and Bydureon
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, particularly:
-
other medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as medicines that work like 
Bydureon (for example: liraglutide or other exenatide containing products), as taking these 
medicines with Bydureon is not recommended.
medicines used to thin the blood (anticoagulants), e.g. Warfarin, as you will require additional 
monitoring of changes in INR (measurement of blood thinning) during initiation of therapy with 
this medicine.
a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur when 
combined with Bydureon. 
if you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will 
recommend that you monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid 
hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that 
occurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin).
-
-
-
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
It is not known if this medicine may harm your unborn child, therefore you should not use it during 
pregnancy and for at least 3 months before a planned pregnancy.
It is not known if exenatide passes into your milk. You should not use this medicine while 
breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You should use contraception if you could potentially become pregnant during treatment with this 
medicine.
Driving and using machines
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can
occur. Hypoglycaemia may reduce your ability to concentrate. Please keep this possible problem in 
mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or using 
machines).
Important information about some of the ingredients of Bydureon
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”.

3.
How to use Bydureon
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse has told you. Check 
with your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure.
You should inject this medicine once a week, at any time of day, with or without meals.
You should inject this medicine into the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area 
(abdomen), upper leg (thigh), or the back of your upper arm. Do not inject into a vein or muscle.
Each week you can use the same area of your body. Be sure to choose a different injection site in that 
area.
Never mix insulin and Bydureon together in the same injection. If you need to give yourself both at the 
same time, use two separate injections. You may give both injections in the same body area (for 
example, your stomach area), but you should not give the injections next to each other.
Test your blood glucose levels regularly, it is particularly important to do this if you are also using a 
sulphonylurea.
Follow the “Instructions for the User” provided in the carton to inject Bydureon
Your doctor or diabetes nurse should teach you how to inject this medicine before you use it for the 
first time.
Check that the liquid in the syringe is clear and free of particles before you begin. After mixing, use 
the suspension only if the mixture is white to off white and cloudy. If you see clumps of dry powder 
on the sides or bottom of the vial, the medicine is NOT mixed well. Shake vigorously again until well 
mixed.
You should inject this medicine immediately after mixing the powder and the solvent.
Use a new injection needle for each injection and dispose of it safely after each use as instructed by 
your doctor or diabetes nurse. 
If you use more Bydureon than you should
If you use more of this medicine than you should, please consult with your doctor first as you may 
need medical treatment. Using too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or 
symptoms of low blood sugar (see section 4).
If you forget to use Bydureon
You might like to choose a day that you always plan to make your Bydureon injection. 
If you miss a dose and there are 3 days or more until your next dose is due, then take the missed dose 
as soon as it is possible to do so. For your next injection you can return to your chosen injection day. 
If you miss a dose and there are only 1 or 2 days until your next dose is due, skip the missed dose and 
take the next one as usual, on the day it is due. You can also change your chosen injection day, as long 
as your last dose was given 3 or more days before. 
Do not take two doses of Bydureon within 3 days of each other.
If you are not sure you have taken the full dose of Bydureon
If you are not sure if you have taken all of your dose, do not inject another dose of this medicine, just 
take it next week as planned.
If you stop using Bydureon
If you feel you should stop using this medicine, please consult your doctor first. If you stop using this 
medicine this can affect your blood sugar levels. 
107
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes 
nurse.

adult patients), SGLT2 inhibitors and/or a long-acting insulin. Your doctor is now prescribing this 
medicine as an additional medicine to help control your blood sugar. Continue to follow your food and 
exercise plan
You have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in 
your blood or your body is not able to use the insulin properly. This medicine helps your body to 
increase the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. 
2. What you need to know before you use Bydureon

How to use Bydureon 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse has told you. Check 
with your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure.
You should inject this medicine once a week, at any time of day, with or without meals.
You should inject this medicine into the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area 
(abdomen), upper leg (thigh), or the back of your upper arm. Do not inject into a vein or muscle.
Each week you can use the same area of your body. Be sure to choose a different injection site in that 
area.
Never mix insulin and Bydureon together in the same injection. If you need to give yourself both at the 
same time, use two separate injections. You may give both injections in the same body area (for 
example, your stomach area), but you should not give the injections next to each other.
Test your blood glucose levels regularly, it is particularly important to do this if you are also using a 
sulphonylurea.
Follow the “Instructions for the User” provided in the carton to inject Bydureon
Your doctor or diabetes nurse should teach you how to inject this medicine before you use it for the 
first time.
Remove one pen from the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.
Check that the liquid in the pen is clear and free of particles before you begin. After mixing the liquid 
with the powder, use the suspension only if the mixture is white to off white and cloudy. If you see 
clumps of dry powder on the sides of the pen, the medicine is NOT mixed well. Tap vigorously again
until well mixed.
You should inject this medicine immediately after mixing the powder and the solvent.
Use a new pen for each injection. You should dispose of the pen safely, with the needle still attached, 
after use, as instructed by your doctor or diabetes nurse.
If you use more Bydureon than you should
If you use more of this medicine than you should, please consult with your doctor first as you may 
need medical treatment. Using too much of this medicine can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or 
symptoms of low blood sugar (see section 4).
If you forget to use Bydureon 
You might like to choose a day that you always plan to make your Bydureon injection. 
If you miss a dose and there are 3 days or more until your next dose is due, then take the missed dose 
as soon as it is possible to do so. For your next injection you can return to your chosen injection day.  
If you miss a dose and there are only 1 or 2 days until your next dose is due, skip the missed dose and 
take the next one as usual, on the day it is due. You can also change your chosen injection day, as long 
as your last dose was given 3 or more days before. 
Do not take two doses of Bydureon within 3 days of each other.
If you are not sure you have taken the full dose of Bydureon
If you are not sure if you have taken all of your dose, do not inject another dose of this medicine, just 
take it next week as planned.
114
If you stop using Bydureon 
If you feel you should stop using this medicine, please consult your doctor first. If you stop using this

How to store Bydureon
Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Bydureon is and what it is used for
Bydureon contains the active substance exenatide. It is an injectable medicine used to improve blood 
sugar control in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
This medicine is used in combination with the following diabetes medicines: metformin, 
sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones (combination therapy with thiazolidinedione was only studied in 
adult patients), SGLT2 inhibitors and/or a long-acting insulin. Your doctor is now prescribing this 
medicine as an additional medicine to help control your blood sugar. Continue to follow your food and 
exercise plan.
You have diabetes because your body does not make enough insulin to control the level of sugar in 
your blood or your body is not able to use the insulin properly. This medicine helps your body to 
increase the production of insulin when your blood sugar is high. 
2. What you need to know before you use Bydureon 
Do not use Bydureon:
-
If you are allergic to exenatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or diabetes nurse before using Bydureon about the following:
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar 
-
(hypoglycaemia) can occur. Test your blood glucose levels regularly. Ask your doctor, 
pharmacist, or diabetes nurse if you are not sure if any of your other medicines contain a 
sulphonylurea.
If you have type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as this medicine should not be used.
How to inject this medicine. It should be injected into the skin and not into a vein or into the 
muscle. 
-
-
120
-
-
-
-
If you have severe problems with your stomach emptying (including gastroparesis) or food 
digestion, as the use of this medicine is not recommended. The active substance in this medicine 
slows stomach emptying so food passes more slowly through your stomach.
If you have ever had inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) (see section 4).
If you lose weight too quickly (more than 1.5 kg per week) talk to your doctor about it since this 
may cause problems such as gallstones.
If you have severe kidney disease or you are on dialysis, as the use of this medicine is not 
recommended.
Bydureon is not an insulin and should therefore not be used as a substitute for insulin. 
Children and adolescents
Bydureon can be used in adolescents and children aged 10 years and above. There is no data available 
for use of this medicine in children below 10 years of age.
Other medicines and Bydureon
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines, particularly:
-
other medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes, such as medicines that work like 
Bydureon (for example: liraglutide or other exenatide containing products, as taking these 
medicines with Bydureon is not recommended.
medicines used to thin the blood (anticoagulants), e.g. Warfarin, as you will require additional 
monitoring of changes in INR (measurement of blood thinning) during initiation of therapy with 
this medicine.
a medicine that contains a sulphonylurea, as low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur when 
combined with Bydureon.
if you are using insulin, your doctor will tell you how to reduce the dose of insulin and will 
recommend that you monitor your blood sugar more frequently, in order to avoid 
hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes that 
occurs when the body is unable to break down glucose because there is not enough insulin).

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
You should use contraception if you could potentially become pregnant during treatment with this 
medicine.
Driving and using machines
If you use this medicine in combination with a sulphonylurea, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can

Common questions and answers.
1. Getting Started
1a
Take a single-dose kit from the refrigerator. 
Prepare to safely dispose of used needles and syringes. Have what you need ready in order to safely 
dispose of used needles and syringes.
1b Wash your hands.
1c
Peel back the cover to open.
Remove the syringe. The liquid in the syringe should be clear and free of particles. It is okay if there 
are air bubbles.
Place the needle, vial connector package, vial, and syringe on a clean, flat surface.
128
1d
Pick up the needle, and twist off the blue cap.
Put the covered needle down. The needle is now prepared. You will need it later.
There is a spare needle in case you need it.
1e
Tap!
Pick up the vial.
Tap the vial several times against a hard surface to loosen the powder.
1f
Use your thumb to remove the green cap.
Put the vial down.
129
2. Connecting the parts
2a
Pick up the vial connector package and peel off the paper cover. Do not touch the orange 
connector inside.
2b
Hold the vial connector package.
In your other hand, hold the vial. 
2c
130
Press the top of the vial firmly into the orange connector.
2d
Lift the vial with the orange connector now attached out of its package.
2e
This is what the vial should now look like.
Put it down for later.
2f
Pick up the syringe.
131
With your other hand, firmly hold the 2 grey squares on the white cap.
2g
Snap!
Break off the cap
Be careful not to push in the plunger.
Just like you might break a stick, you are breaking off the cap.
2h
This is what the broken-off cap looks like.
You will not need the cap and can throw it away.
2i
132
This is what the syringe should now look like.
2j
Now, pick up the vial with the orange connector attached.
Twist the orange connector onto the syringe until snug. While twisting, be sure to hold the orange 
connector. Do not over tighten. Be careful not to push in the plunger.
2k
This is how the parts should now look when they are connected.
3. Mixing the medicine and filling the syringe
IMPORTANT:
During these next steps, you will be mixing the medicine and filling the syringe. Once you mix 
the medicine, you must inject it immediately. You must not save the mixed medicine to inject at 
a later time. 
3a
With your thumb, push down the plunger until it stops and hold your thumb in place.
133
The plunger may feel like it is springing back a little.
3b
Keep pushing down on the plunger with your thumb and shake vigorously. Keep shaking until 
the liquid and powder are mixed well. 
Do not worry that the vial might come off. The orange connector will keep it attached to the syringe.
Shake vigorously like you would shake a bottle of oil-and-vinegar salad dressing.
3c
When the medicine is mixed well, it should look cloudy.
134
If you see clumps of dry powder on the sides or bottom of the vial, the medicine is NOT mixed 
well.
Shake vigorously again until well mixed.
Keep pushing on the plunger with your thumb while shaking.
3e
Now, hold the vial so the syringe is pointing up. Keep pushing on the plunger with your thumb 
until it stops, and hold it in place.
3f
Gently tap the vial with the other hand. Keep pushing on the plunger with your thumb to keep 
the plunger in place.
The tapping helps the medicine drip down along the sides of the vial. It is okay if there are air bubbles. 
3g
Pull the plunger down beyond the black dashed Dose Line.
This draws the medicine from the vial into the syringe. You may see air bubbles. This is normal.
A little bit of liquid may cling to the sides of the vial. This is also normal.
135
3h
With one hand, hold the plunger in place so it does not move.
3i
With the other hand, twist the orange connector to remove.
After removing the connector be careful not to push in the plunger.
3j
This is what the syringe should now look like.
4. Injecting the medicine
IMPORTANT:
Read the next steps carefully and look closely at the pictures.
This helps you get the correct dose of medicine.
136
4a
Twist the needle onto the syringe until snug. Do not remove the needle cover yet.
Be careful not to push in the plunger.
4b
Slowly 
push
Top of 
plunger
Slowly push in the plunger so the top of the plunger lines up with the black dashed Dose Line.
Then, take your thumb off the plunger.
It is important to stop pushing at this point, or you will waste your medicine and you will not get the 
correct dose.
4c
The top of the plunger must stay lined up with the black dashed Dose Line as you go through the 
next steps. This will help you get the correct dose of medicine.
IMPORTANT:
It is normal to see a few air bubbles in the mixture.
The air bubbles will not harm you or affect your dose.

Each week you can use the same area of your body. But be sure to choose a different injection site in 
that area.
4e
Hold the syringe near the black dashed Dose Line.
4f
Pull
Pull the needle cover straight off.
Do not twist.
Be careful not to push in the plunger.
When you remove the cover, you may see 1 or 2 drops of liquid. This is normal.
138
4g
Be sure to use the injection technique recommended by your doctor or diabetes nurse.
Remember: You must take your injection of Bydureon immediately after mixing it.
Insert the needle into your skin (subcutaneously). To inject your full dose, push down on the 
plunger with your thumb until it stops.
Withdraw the needle.
Refer to the package leaflet (section 3) on what to do if you are not sure if you have received a 
complete dose.
4h. Dispose of the syringe with the needle still attached as instructed by your doctor or diabetes 
nurse. DO NOT try to recap or reuse the needle.
You do not have to save any parts. Each single-dose kit has everything you need for your weekly dose 
of Bydureon.
Medicines should not be disposed of via waste water or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to 
dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.
When it is time for your next weekly dose, start again at step 1.

Common questions and answers
1. After I mix the medicine, how long can I wait before taking the injection?
You must take your injection of Bydureon immediately after mixing it. If you do not inject Bydureon 
immediately, the medicine will start to form small clumps in the syringe. These clumps could clog the 
needle when you take the injection (see question 7).
2. How do I know that the medicine is mixed well?
When the medicine is mixed well, it should look cloudy. There should not be any dry powder on the 
sides or bottom of the vial. If you do see any dry powder, shake vigorously while continuing to push 
down on the plunger with your thumb. (This question relates to the steps shown in sections 3a to 3d).
139
3. I’m ready to take the injection. What should I do if I see air bubbles in the syringe?
It is normal for air bubbles to be in the syringe. The air bubbles will not harm you or affect your dose. 
Bydureon is injected into your skin (subcutaneously). Air bubbles are not a problem with this type of 
injection.
4. What should I do if I have trouble attaching the needle?
First, be sure you have removed the blue cap. Then, twist the needle onto the syringe until snug. To 
prevent losing medicine, do not push in the plunger while attaching the needle. For more information 
on injection techniques talk with your health care professional.
(This question relates to step 4a.)
5. What should I do if I have trouble removing the needle cover?
With one hand, hold the syringe near the black dashed Dose Line. With your other hand, hold the 
needle cover. Pull the needle cover straight off. Do not twist it. (This question relates to step 4f.)
6. I am at step 4c. What should I do if the top of the plunger has been pushed past the black 
dashed Dose Line?
The black dashed Dose Line shows the correct dose. If the top of the plunger has been pushed past the 
line, you should continue from step 4d and take the injection. Before your next injection in 1 week, 
carefully review the instructions for steps 3a to 4h. 
7. When I inject, what should I do if I cannot push the plunger all the way down?
This means the needle has become clogged. Remove the needle and replace it with the spare needle 
from your kit. Then choose a different injection site and finish taking the injection.
To review how to:



Remove the blue cap of the needle, see step 1d 
Attach the needle, see step 4a 
Remove the needle cover and give the injection, see steps 4e to 4g
If you still cannot push the plunger all the way down, withdraw the needle. Refer to the package leaflet 
(section 3) on what to do if you are not sure if you have received a complete dose.
To prevent a clogged needle, always mix the medicine very well, and inject immediately after mixing.
Bydureon only needs to be taken once a week.
Make a note that you have taken your Bydureon today and mark your calendar for when you are due 
for your next injection.

Common Questions and Answers
1.
How do I know that the medicine is mixed well?
The medicine is mixed well when the liquid looks cloudy from both sides of the window. You 
should not see any clumps in the liquid. It may help to hold the pen up to the light to see in the 
window. If you see clumps of any size keep tapping the pen firmly against the palm of your 
hand until mixed.
2.
I am having trouble mixing my dose. What should I do?
Remember, before preparing your dose, leave the pen out of the refrigerator for at least 15 
minutes. This will let the pen warm up to room temperature. It will be easier to mix the 
medicine if the pen is at room temperature.
Be sure you are holding the pen at the end with the knob and the orange label. This will help 
you grip the pen better and tap it more firmly against your palm.
It may also help to tap the mixing window on both sides against your palm. If you see any 
clumps, keep tapping.
144
3.
After I mix the medicine, how long can I wait before taking the injection?
You must inject your dose right after mixing it. If you do not inject your dose right away, 
small clumps of medicine may form in the pen and you may not get your full dose.
4.
I’m ready to inject my dose. What should I do if I see air bubbles in the pen?
It is normal for air bubbles to be in the pen. The medicine is injected into your skin 
(subcutaneously). Air bubbles will not harm you or affect your dose with this type of 
injection.
5.
What should I do if I cannot push the injection button all the way in when trying to 
inject my dose?
Check that you have fully screwed on the pen needle. Also be sure you twisted the knob until 
it stopped, the orange label disappeared, and the injection button appears.
If you still cannot push the button in, this may mean that the needle is clogged. Remove the 
needle from your skin and replace it with the spare needle from the carton. Review how to 
attach the needle. Then choose a different injection site and finish taking the injection.
If you still cannot push the button all the way in, remove the needle from your skin. Use a 
puncture-resistant container to throw away the pen with the needle still attached.
6.
How do I know if I injected my full dose?
To be sure you get your full dose, press the injection button with your thumb until you hear a 
click. After the click, continue to hold the needle in your skin for 10 seconds. This will allow 
enough time for all the medicine to go from the pen to under your skin.
7.
How do I dispose of my Bydureon pen?
You will need a puncture-resistant container that is large enough to hold the entire pen with a 
used needle attached. Be sure the container has a lid. You may use a biohazard container, 
another hard plastic container, or a metal container. A container is not included in the carton.
Ask your pharmacist how to safely throw away the container with used pens and needles. Do 
not throw the container in your household waste.

    Figure Q
151
  
Common Questions and Answers
1. Where is the needle?
The needle is attached to the pen and covered by the orange cap.
When you unscrew the orange cap, the green shield keeps the needle covered until you inject.
For more information, please see Figure N in Step 3B in the Instructions for the User.
2. How do I know if the medicine is fully mixed?
After shaking the pen, look through both sides of the window. You should not see any white medicine 
along the bottom, top, or sides. If you see white medicine, it is unmixed. To mix, shake the pen hard 
until the white medicine is no longer on the bottom, top, or sides. The medicine should look even 
throughout (see pictures in Figure G and Figure H, Step 2C).
3. Why do I need to hold the pen upright while removing the orange cap?
Holding the pen with the orange cap straight up helps prevent the medicine from leaking. It is normal 
to see a few drops of medicine inside the orange cap after you unscrew it.
4. Why should I inject my medicine right away after mixing it?
If you do not inject your medicine right away after mixing, the medicine may separate, and you will 
not get your full dose. You can re-mix your medicine if your pen is in the locked position. However, 
after you unlock it, you must complete the preparation steps right away and inject to get the full dose. 
You cannot save it for later use.
5. How do I know I gave myself the full dose of medicine?
To be sure you get your full dose, press and hold the pen against your skin.
You will feel the needle go into your skin. Hold the needle against your skin for 15 seconds. This will 
allow enough time for all the medicine to go from the pen to under your skin. After removing the 
needle, look for the orange rod in the window as a way to tell that the dose has been given. If the 
orange rod does not appear, contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(see section 6 of the Package Leaflet for a list of contacts by country).
6. Why should I store my pen flat in the refrigerator?
Pens stored vertically (with the needle up or down) are more difficult to mix. The medicine can still be 
fully mixed but it will take more shaking and more time.
7. How do I dispose of my Bydureon BCise pen?
Do not throw away the pen in your household waste. You will need a puncture-resistant container that 
is large enough to hold the entire pen. Be sure the container has a lid. You may use a biohazard 
container, another hard plastic container, or a metal container. A container is not included in the 
carton.
Do not recycle the container with used pens. Ask your pharmacist how to safely throw it away. Do not 
throw the container in your household waste.
8. What if the device malfunctions and I cannot unlock it?
Review the Instructions for the User Step 3 to confirm the order of operations, then contact the local 
representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (see section 6 of the Package Leaflet for a list of 
contacts by country). Do not try to unlock with excessive force or tools.
9. What if the device malfunctions and I cannot remove the orange cap?

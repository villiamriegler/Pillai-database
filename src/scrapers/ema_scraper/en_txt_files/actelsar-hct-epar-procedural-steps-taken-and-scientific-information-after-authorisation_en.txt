Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit-
risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the 
combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine 
whether any regulatory measures should be taken on 
the marketing authorisations of the products 
involved in this procedure.

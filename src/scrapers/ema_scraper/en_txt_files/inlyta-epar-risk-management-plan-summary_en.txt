SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Inlyta
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Inlyta.  The RMP details 
important risks of Inlyta, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Inlyta's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Inlyta's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Inlyta should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Inlyta should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
There are no new important safety concerns identified with axitinib, however changes to the 
current ones are included in updates of Inlyta's RMP.
The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Inlyta is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine.  It contains axitinib as the active 
substance and it is given by oral route of administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Inlyta’s benefits can be found in Inlyta’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the
medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/inlyta
Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks
Important risks of Inlyta, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Inlyta’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Inlyta is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Inlyta are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Inlyta. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected.

Important Identified Risk: Arterial Embolic and Thrombotic Events
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Evidence Source:
Inlyta clinical trials and post-marketing reports.
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Strength of evidence:
Arterial embolic and thrombotic events have been reported for other vascular 
endothelial growth factor inhibitors, and have been reported in Inlyta clinical 
trials and in the post-marketing setting.
Cancer patients have an increased risk of arterial embolic and thrombotic 
events.  Increasing age, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
polycythaemia, and a history of arterial embolic and thrombotic events are 
other recognised predisposing risk factors for arterial embolic and thrombotic 
events.

Important Identified Risk: Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Evidence Source:
Inlyta clinical trials and post-marketing reports.
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Strength of evidence:
In non-clinical studies, gastrointestinal toxicity to the alimentary tract was 
observed following repeat dosing, including haemorrhage and/or necrosis of 
the oral, stomach or intestinal mucosa.  Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula 
have been reported in Inlyta clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting.
Acute conditions involving the bowel, including tumour at the site of 
perforation, acute diverticulitis, bowel obstruction and carcinomatosis, as well 
as radiation, may be associated with an increased risk of developing 
gastrointestinal perforation.  Risk factors for fistula formation in subjects with 
renal cell carcinoma who are treated with anti-angiogenic agents are unknown.

Important Identified Risk: Renal Failure
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Evidence Source:
Inlyta clinical trials and post-marketing reports.
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Strength of evidence:
Most cases of renal failure in the clinical trial and in the post-marketing setting 
involved known risk factors which may have contributed to the development 
of renal failure.
In a retrospective review of 108 Korean patients with renal cell carcinoma, 
39.8% developed chronic kidney disease post-surgery.  Risk factors identified 
for renal failure include advanced age; chronic infection; diabetes; 
hypertension; heart failure; immune disorders, such as lupus, immunoglobulin 
A nephropathy and scleroderma; hepatic disease; prostate gland enlargement; 
and bladder outlet obstruction.  Risk factors for prerenal acute renal failure 
include dehydration, heart failure, sepsis, and severe blood loss.

Risk factors and risk groups
Risk minimisation measures
Strength of evidence:
Congestive heart failure/cardiomyopathy has been reported with other tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors and has been reported in Inlyta clinical trials and in the 
post-marketing setting.
In cases of congestive heart failure/cardiomyopathy, for which medical history 
was reported, most patients had a personal or family history of coronary artery 
disease and/or one or more risk factors, including cigarette smoking, 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, advanced age, and obesity.

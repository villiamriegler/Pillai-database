Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Voriconazole Hospira 
voriconazole 
On 26 March 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Voriconazole 
Hospira, intended for the treatment of fungal infections.  
The applicant for this medicinal product is Hospira UK Limited. 
Voriconazole Hospira will be available as a powder (200 mg) to be made up into a solution for infusion. 
The active substance of Voriconazole Hospira is voriconazole, a broad spectrum, triazole antifungal agent 
(ATC code: J02AC03) that acts by inhibiting the enzyme 14-α-sterol demethylase, resulting in depletion 
of ergosterol and accumulation of 14- α-methylated sterols which are thought to contribute to the 
disruption of fungal cell membrane structure and function, thereby inhibiting fungal growth. 
Voriconazole Hospira is a generic of Vfend, which has been authorised in the EU since 19 March 2002.  
The full indication is: "Voriconazole is a broad spectrum, triazole antifungal agent and is indicated in 
adults and children aged 2 years and above as follows:  
 
 
 
 
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis.  
Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.  
Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei).  
Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp.  
Voriconazole should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, possibly life-threatening 
infections." 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and

I. RECOMMENDATION 
Based on the review of the paediatric data on safety and immunogenicity collected in study Rota-074 
the  Rapporteur  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  the  above  mentioned  product  remains 
unchanged and therefore does not require further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for 
Rotarix. The SmPC and PIL remain unchanged.  
II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
The  current  study  was  submitted  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Article  46  of  the  regulation 
1901/2006.  The  study  has  not  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  an  agreed  paediatric  investigation 
plan.  
Adhering to the requirements of Chinese regulatory authorities and in order to support the licensure of 
GSK Biologicals' liquid HRV vaccine in China, it was necessary to conduct a Phase I safety study in the 
targeted infant population. This study was conducted to collect reactogenicity and safety data of liquid 
HRV vaccine from infants aged 6 to 16 weeks at the time of the first dose of vaccination. In addition, 
the  immunogenicity  of  the  liquid  HRV  vaccine  was  also  explored  in  order  to  assess  the  anti-RV  IgA 
antibody concentrations and vaccine take. 
1. STUDY METHODOLOGY 
1. Objectives 
Primary 
To assess the reactogenicity of the liquid HRV vaccine when compared to placebo in terms of grade 3 
solicited adverse events (AEs). 
Secondary 
• 
• 
• 
Exploratory 
• 
To  assess  the  reactogenicity  of  the  liquid  HRV  vaccine  when  compared  to  placebo  in  terms  of 
solicited AEs. 
To  assess  the  safety  of  the  liquid  HRV  vaccine  when  compared  to  placebo  in  terms  of  unsolicited 
AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
To  explore  the  excretion  of  the  rotavirus  (RV)  antigen  in  the  stool  samples  collected  at 
predetermined time points after each liquid HRV vaccine/placebo dose. 
To  explore  the  immunogenicity  of  the  liquid  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  seroconversion  rate  and 
Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) after a two dose primary vaccination course.

3. Laboratory assays and time-points 
Stool analysis 
Two aliquots were prepared for all stool samples collected at pre-determined time points: One aliquot 
was  shipped  frozen  to  a  National  Institute  for  Food  and  Drug  Control  (NIFDC  in  China)  [previously 
known  as  the  National  Institute  for  the  Control  of  Pharmaceutical  and  Biological  products  (NICPBP)] 
and the other aliquot was shipped frozen to GSK Biologicals, Belgium, for back-up. 
All stool samples were analysed by ELISA for detection of RV antigen to assess RV antigen excretion. 
Presence  of  RV  antigen  demonstrated  by  ELISA  in  any  stool  collected  at  pre-determined  time  points 
after Dose 1 up to Visit 3 were considered as vaccine virus shedding. 
Serum analysis 
Two  aliquots  were  prepared  for  all  serum  samples  collected  at  Visit  1  and  Visit  3:  One  aliquot  was 
shipped  frozen  to  a  qualified  laboratory  in  China  and  the  other  aliquot  was  shipped  frozen  to  GSK 
Biologicals, Belgium (or Sponsor designated laboratory), for back-up. 
Serum obtained from whole blood samples collected from subjects at Visit 1 and Visit 3 were tested by 
ELISA to measure serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations. The assay cut-off was 20 U/mL. Table 5 
gives the assay method used for determining the antibody concentration and the assay cut-off. 
4. Assessment of safety variables 
Adverse events 
The following general AEs were solicited as shown in Table 6: 
Assessment of intensity of Adverse Events 
Cf. Clinical Study report p. 43-46 
The intensity scales are represented in Tables 7.

The maximum intensity of diarrhoea, vomiting and fever that occurred during the solicited 8-day (Day 
0-Day 7) follow-up period was scored as shown in Table 8. 
5. Determination of sample size 
Target  enrolment  was  50  eligible  subjects  (25  subjects  in  the  HRV  Group  and  25  subjects  in  the 
Placebo  Group)  in  order  to  obtain  40  evaluable  subjects  (20  subjects  in  each  group).  The  estimated 
drop-out rate was 20%. 
The primary objective of the study was to explore the reactogenicity of the vaccine in order to detect a 
large  increase  in  the  HRV  Group  as  compared  to  the  Placebo  Group  for  the  percentage  of  subjects 
reporting  grade  3  solicited  AEs  during  the  8-day  (Day  0-Day  7)  solicited  follow-up  period  after  each 
dose. With 25 subjects in the HRV Group and 25 subjects in the Placebo Group, Table 10 presents the 
increase in the percentage of subjects reporting at least one grade 3 solicited AE during the 8-day (Day 
Rotarix

0-Day 7) solicited follow-up period after each dose that could have been detected in the HRV Group as 
compared to the Placebo Group, with 80% power, for a range of incidence rates: 
6. Study cohorts/data sets analyzed 
Total vaccinated cohort (TVC) 
The  TVC  included  all  subjects  with  at  least  one  dose  of  liquid  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  administration 
documented: 
• 
• 
a safety analysis based on the TVC included all vaccinated subjects. 
an  immunogenicity  analysis  based  on  the  TVC  included  all  vaccinated  subjects  for  whom 
immunogenicity data was available. 
ATP cohort for analysis of safety 
The ATP cohort for safety included all subjects from the TVC: 
•  who had received the study vaccine according to the protocol, 
•  who had not received a vaccine forbidden by or not specified in the protocol, 
• 
• 
•  who were seronegative for serum anti-RV IgA antibodies on the day of Dose 1. 
for whom the randomisation code had not been broken, 
for whom the study vaccine or placebo was administered according to the protocol, 
The TVC was used for the primary analysis of safety. The analysis on the ATP cohort for safety was to 
be performed only if more than 5% of the vaccinated subjects were excluded from the TVC. 
ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all subjects from the ATP cohort for safety: 
•  who had not received medication forbidden by the protocol, 
•  whose underlying medical condition was not forbidden by the protocol, 
• 
for whom immunogenicity data was available, at pre-sampling and post-sampling time points, 
•  with no protocol violation of demographics (unknown age at study entry or outside reporting), 
•  who complied with the vaccination schedule, 
•  who complied with the blood sampling schedule, 
•  who had no RV other than the vaccine strain in GE stool samples collected up to Visit 3, 
•  who  had  no  concomitant  infection  unrelated  to  the  vaccine  which  might  have  influenced  the 
immune response. 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity.  If,  in  any  vaccine 
group, the percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort for 
analysis of immunogenicity was 5% or more, a second analysis based on the TVC was to be performed 
to complement the ATP analysis.

A. Immunogenicity results 
The exploratory analyses for immunogenicity was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity and 
on  TVC  since  more  than  5%  of  the  vaccinated  subjects  were  eliminated  from  the  ATP  cohort  for 
immunogenicity.

Vaccine take 
Assessor’s note 
“Vaccine take” is a combined immunogenicity endpoint based on seroconversion and/or shedding 
of  the  vaccine  strain  in  stools.  It  is  considered  as  being  positive  when  serum  IgA  to  RV  in  post-
vaccination  sera  is  at  a  concentration  of  ≥20  U/ml  and/or  when  vaccine  virus  is  shedding  in any 
stool sample collected from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo up to Visit 3 (=one month after the 
last vaccine dose) in subjects who were negative for RV before Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo. 
Table  24  presents  percentage  of  subjects  with  vaccine  take  at  Visit  3  for  the  ATP  cohort  for 
immunogenicity.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  vaccine  take  at  Visit  3  was  86.7%  [95%  CI:  59.5; 
98.3] in the HRV Group.

Unsolicited adverse events 
During the 31-day (Day 0-Day 30) follow-up period at least one unsolicited symptom was reported for 
six subjects (24%) in the HRV group and three subjects (12%) in the placebo Group. Nasopharyngitis 
was the most frequently reported unsolicited symptom in both the groups (four subjects (16%) in the 
HRV group and three subjects (12%) in the placebo group). Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported for 
one  subject  (4%)  in  each  group.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  any  unsolicited  AEs  with  causal 
relationship to vaccination. 
ATP cohort for safety analysis 
Safety results of the ATP cohort for safety were in line with those of the TVC. 
III. DISCUSSION AND MAH’S OVERALL CONCLUSIONS (SUMMARY) 
The  occurrence  of  unsolicited  AEs  and  SAEs  observed  in  this  study  was  similar  to  that  of  the  studies 
conducted  in  the other  Asian  populations  of  similar age  group.  At least one  unsolicited  symptom  was 
reported  for  14.6%  (95%  CI:  6.1-27.8)  of  the  doses  in  the  HRV  Group,  which  is  similar  to  that 
observed in a group of subjects who received liquid HRV vaccine according to a 0, 1 month schedule in 
Rotarix

studies  conducted  in  Vietnam  (15.6%  [95%  CI:  12.4:  19.3])  and  the  Philippines  (15.7%  [95%  CI: 
12.5:  19.5])  [Anh,  2011].  There  were  no  SAEs  with  causal  relationship  to  vaccination  nor  fatal  SAEs 
reported in this study, which is similar to that observed in a study conducted in Korea [GSK Biologicals 
Clinical Report 112269/068, 2011]. 
In the stool samples collected at pre-determined time points, RV antigen was detected in stool samples 
collected  from  two  subjects  in  the  HRV  Group  at  Day  7  after  Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine  which  is  similar 
that  of  a  trial  conducted  in  Singapore  were  shedding  of  vaccine  (RIX4414)  virus  was  detected  in  a 
large proportion of vaccinated infants on the seventh day after administration of the first dose of HRV 
vaccine  [Phua,  2005].  RV  detected in  the  stool  sample  collected  at  Visit  3  from  one  of  the  subject in 
the Placebo group was probably due to natural infection. 
The results of this study support the conduct of further clinical studies with the liquid HRV vaccine in 
the infant population in China.
